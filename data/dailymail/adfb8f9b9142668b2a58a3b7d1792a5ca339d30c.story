'Radicalised': Yusra Hussien, 15, who is believed to have travelled to Syria after talking online with young British women already in the country

The 15-year-old girl from Bristol believed to have travelled to Syria to marry an Islamic State militant may have been recruited by British women already in the country.

Police believe Yusra Hussien from Bristol was communicating online with a British woman in Syria just weeks before she and a 17-year-old friend from London left the UK.

One message posted online said: 'I yearn to be the wife of a mujahid and support him and khilafa (the Islamic caliphate) all the way.'

As many as 70 women and girls are among the hundreds of British Muslims thought to have travelled to fight alongside Islamic State in Syria.

Some, the Sunday Times reports, have joined an all-female religious police unit in Raqqa, the de facto capital of IS's self-declared caliphate, called the al-Khanssaa brigade.

This unit enforces a strict interpretation of religious morality on local women, dishing out beatings to those caught breaking the Islamic dress code, smoking, or otherwise transgressing the law.

One member, with the alias 'Umm Ubaydah', uses Tumblr, the social networking and blogging site, to communicate with Muslims thinking of travelling to Syria.

The Sunday Times claims that she is an 18-year-old from London of Somali heritage, although she denies being British in a post on her Tumblr blog.

Among posts advising on whether it is possible to get hair straighteners in the caliphate and what kind of smartphone apps will be useful, she advised what the Sunday Times says is a 15-year-old from Britain.

The anonymous questioner asked: 'I so badly want to go to raqqah and live under the shariah and live in the land of khilafa but as a young muslimah in the uk it's rly difficult and my family would be completely against it.

'I want to escape the fitna of the kuffar land please make dua Allah allows me to make hijra to the lands of khilafa, it hurts my heart to live here.

'I yearn to be the wife of a mujahid and support him and khilafa all the way.'

Umm Ubaydah told her: 'It is a beautiful feeling being married to a mujahid... My advice to you is hasten, because I’ve seen people who wanted to make hijrah for so long and delayed it (for no legit reason) untill [sic] the punishment of Allāh came upon them and they remained in Dar al kufr [land of the unbelievers].'

Detectives at the South East Counter Terrorism Unit were examining the exchanges, according to the Sunday Times.

Yusra 15-year-old has not been seen since she left her family home in Easton, Bristol, for school on September 24. Police believe she took a coach from Bristol to Heathrow, where she met a 17-year-old girl from Lambeth, South London.

The pair then flew to Istanbul, Turkey, before presumably heading for the Syrian border.

Last week Yusra's mother, Safiya Hussien, made a desperate appeal for the schoolgirl to return home, as hopes of finding her before she crossed the border appeared to fade.

She wept as she begged the schoolgirl to return to Britain in an emotional press conference.

'Yusra, I am your mum, I love you,' Mrs Hussien, supported by Yusra's aunts Sucdi Ali and Ikram Mohamed, said. 'Please, please, please, we miss you, come back.

'I love you so much. All your brothers and your sister miss you so, so much. The house is not the same.'

Umm Ubaydah's Tumblr blog: She gave advice to a 15-year-old girl on whether to travel to Syria against her parents wishes. It seems likely this was Yusra, who disappeared a little over a month after the messages

Family friends previously said they believed Yusra, who wears a hijab as part of her faith, had become radicalised on chat rooms and forums online. It is not yet clear how she met the 17-year-old.

But Yusra's parents have stressed that nothing has been proven about their daughter's beliefs.

In a statement her mother and father Mohammed Hussien said: 'There have been many assumptions and speculations claiming that Yusra is travelling to Syria, that she maybe an extremist, or that she is planning to become a jihadist bride all of which have not as of yet been proved with any concrete evidence.'

The family also echoed calls for action over the role of border officials in preventing children from flying abroad without their parents.

The girls' disappearance follows that of twins Zahra and Salma Halane, 16, from Manchester, who are thought to have travelled to Syria in July.

More than 500 British extremists are thought to have travelled to the war torn country, around half of whom are said to be from London.
