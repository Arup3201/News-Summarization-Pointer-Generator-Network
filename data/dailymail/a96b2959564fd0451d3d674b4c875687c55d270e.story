An airport mechanic turned his attention away from the aircraft to the prosthetic of an Afghan war veteran whose leg had come loose.

Taylor Morris twisted his prosthetic leg 
out of place while waiting for his flight at McCarran International 
Airport in Las Vegas.

The US Navy bomb specialist could not pop the artificial knee joint 
back into place on his own because the special wrench he needed was in 
his checked luggage.

Keith Duffner who worked at the airport had the right toold for the job and helped the quadruple amputee war veteran.

Morris lost his legs, his left arm and his right hand in 2012 when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan.

With time running out and a fix looking 
unlikely, word eventually reached Keith Duffner, the lead mechanic for 
American Airlines and US Airways at the airport.  

She found airport mechanic Keith Duffner who saluted Morris before setting about to repairing his prosthetic.

Duffner found the pair and went through his tools, finding a similar style wrench that allowed them to pop off the crooked knee and put it back in place.

A photo of the moment has been circulating online, with Duffner drawing praise from strangers and the couple for helping out.

On her blog, Kelly wrote: ‘By the luck of all that is holy, one of the standard Allen wrenches worked!!

‘It wasn’t perfect but it was about 90 per cent better, which allowed for a much smoother travelling day.’

War hero: Thousands of people have been inspired by Taylor Morris' recovery from devastating injuries

In a post on the airport’s Facebook page, the humble mechanic said: ‘Normally we just fix airplanes and don’t interface with passengers. Occasionally we provide tape or glue for an interim repair, or retrieve a lost item that someone has dropped out of reach.

‘What I did wasn’t much, and we all are in his debt to him and his family for sacrificing in service to us.’ 

Thousands of people have been inspired by Morris’ recovery through Kelly’s blog posts, home videos posted on YouTube and social media updates.

Mr Duffner's own daughter, Kayla Erikson, proudly commented about her dad's low-key heroics.

The world fell in love with the high schools sweethearts, from Cedar Falls, Iowa, after a video showed them dancing at a friend’s wedding just five months after he was injured in action.

Morris, an explosive ordinance device technician, lost both of his legs, his left arm and his right hand when he stepped on an improvised explosive device while serving in Afghanistan in May 2012.

Despite suffering horrific injuries, he maintained consciousness and relayed information to his team leaders, earning him the Bronze Star with valor.
