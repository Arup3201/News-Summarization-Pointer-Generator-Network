A 36-year-old New Jersey woman plead guilty today to charges she killed a 2-year-old girl, nearly four years after the toddlers violent death.

Sheila Polanski was babysitting little Madeline McHenry on July 5, 2011 when she shook the toddler to death because she was whining and Polanski was stressed out.

The violent shaking caused Madeline to go unconscious, and it was revealed that Polanski didn't call police until hours later.

Madeline was taken to the hospital, but died two days later.

In court on Thursday, Polanski plead guilty to charges of aggravated manslaughter. She initially faced murder charges and the possibility of life in prison.

After her initial arrest, the girl's family said that Polanski passed the time playing a game on her Facebook account while Madeline lay dying on the floor.

'She threw her to the ground and then proceeded to go and play "Yo-ville" on Facebook because there were Facebook entries of her playing "Yo-ville" for the two hours while my baby lay there dying on the living room floor,' Maddy's grandfather Ted Helgren told ABC 6.

Happy girl: Madeline's dad Dan McHenry described his toddler daughter as having the 'best personality in the world'. 'She loved everything. She loved to sing. She's just the sweetest, cutest little peanut on the planet.'

If the charges weren't downgraded, she could have faced up to life in prison for murder. Polanski is due back in court on May 2 for sentencing.

Parents Jen and Dan McHenry hired Polanski to take care of their daughter, and say she came highly recommended. It was only after Madeline's death that they discovered Polanski was on medication for mental health issues and that she had a prior criminal record.

When Polanski finally called 911, paramedics found fresh bruises on the girls body which Polanski at first denied having anything to do with.

She eventually copped that she shook the girl because she wouldn't stop whining and she was under pressure over a recent eviction.

Madeline was transported to the hospital, but taken off life support two days later and died.

When Polanski was initially arraigned on murder charges in new Jersey court that same month, she openly cried in court.

Madeline's parents also wiped away tears as they faced their little girl's killer.

'I don't know what was going through her mind or how she could pick her up and shake her and throw her across the room and kill my little girl,' Madeline's dad Dan McHenry said.

'She had the best personality in the world, very outgoing,' Mr McHenry added. 'She loved everything. She loved to sing. She's just the sweetest, cutest little peanut on the planet.'
