Six raiders fled on mopeds after failing to break into a Christian Dior shop in central London this morning. 

Police were called at 12.15am to the store in Conduit Street, central London, but arrived before the suspects gained entry to the shop. 

The group smashed the store's glass and damaged the shutters of the door before hopping on their bikes and riding off.

Last September a gang armed with axes and hammers were stopped by armed police as they smashed their way into a jewellers inside Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, east London.

It came after months of similar smash and grab raids on a flagship Gucci store off Sloane Square in central London.

Dozens of designer handbags were 
stolen, including  a £30,000 limited edition crocodile bag, which formed
 part of a £100,000 haul.

Anyone with information that may assist police should call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
