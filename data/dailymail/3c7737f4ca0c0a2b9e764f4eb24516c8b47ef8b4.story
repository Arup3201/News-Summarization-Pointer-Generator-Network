An obese father who was told to give up fast food or lose his kids by his fiancée because she feared he would eat himself to death has slimmed down to 16 stone.

Michael Wareing, 40, from Glasgow, who wore a size XXXXXL, loved to eat kebabs with ‘all the trimmings’ at least once a day and spent £200 a month on takeaways.

He gained 20 stone between 2005 and 2008, after having two children with his fiancée April Roy, 31, taking him to an unhealthy 30 stone.

However, April said Michael’s weight gain meant he didn’t help out around the house or looking after Kieran-Lee, now 11, and Liam, nine, and became a ‘huge strain’ on their relationship, so she gave him an ultimatum.

Mother-of-four April moved into a flat near the family home, but Michael continued to comfort eat – it was then he had gastric sleeve surgery and finally managed to ditch the pounds and win back his family.

April said: ‘I was scared it was putting his life at risk and he’d miss our boys grow up. I told him I was moving me and the boys out. I didn’t want them to see him this way.

‘He had to pick the kebabs or his kids – keep gaining weight and lose us or diet and put his family first.’

In a bid to win back his family, Michael swapped fatty foods for salads, pasta and fish dishes and kept a food diary.

Michael continued to see his sons every weekend, and April rang his mother Janet Wareing regularly to find out his progress.

Thw family can all now enjoy days out together. Miss Roy says that the gastric sleeve surgery was a lifesaver: 'I couldn't be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.'

Mr Wareing couldn't go out and play with his kids as he would be exhausted after five minutes

April said: ‘I didn’t want to call Michael too much in case he thought I was nagging him.

‘Janet told me he was eating healthy and going for walks but he was miserable. When I saw him, he said he was practically starving himself to lose weight for us.

‘But it wasn’t working and he confessed being alone upset him and he comfort ate.’

April said: ‘Janet had seen a TV show about weight loss surgery and thought it could help Michael.’

Michael - who has since had another son and a daughter with April - agreed to go to a Phoenix Health weight loss clinic where a consultant talked him through his options.

In August 2010, two weeks after Michael’s consultation, he was fitted with a gastric sleeve.

The couple started dating in 2003 when they were introduced through Mr Wareing’s brother.

April revealed that when they had their son Kieren-Lee, Michael was a hands-on dad – but it all changed after he put on weight.

She said: ‘Michael was a great dad. He loved bath-times and putting the boys to bed.

‘He got up in the night when they woke up crying and rocked them back to sleep.

‘When Kieren-Lee was bigger, Michael played toy soldiers with him. He loved taking him to the swings or for walks on the beach.’

But in 2005, Mr Wareing became a different person.

April said: ‘He was more reserved and didn’t want to talk about his feelings. I imagined he was missing his other three kids who lived with their mums.

‘So he comfort ate crisps and chocolate. His favourite takeaway was kebabs with all the trimmings.’

A year later, the couple had their second son Liam, now nine.

Michael gained so much weight he struggled to help around the couple’s house and look after their children.

Michael said: ‘I got upset that I couldn’t go out with them and I was how I was. It was unfair on the kids.’

Mid-way through his weight loss, Mr Wareing was already showing signs of a dramatic change

April said: ‘He wasn’t 11 stone anymore. He couldn’t come for walks to the park with us. After five minutes, he’d be exhausted and say his knees hurt.

‘All he could do with our sons was watch TV. I told him I was worried about his weight but it didn’t work.’

By 2008, Mr Wareing had gained 20 stone and wore XXXXXL jeans.

April said: ‘It put a huge strain on our relationship but he didn’t talk about his weight. I had to get him to change his ways.’

In summer 2008 Miss Roy gave him an ultimatum. She said: ‘He had to pick the kebabs or his kids.

“He was upset but we’d talked about his weight before so I knew he understood I was doing it for all of us. I said I loved him but I’d had enough.’

Abandoned by his family, it was the push Michael needed. The gastric sleeve procedure meant he could only eat small portions or liquids like soup.

April said: ‘He said his lunch looked like baby food, but it worked.’

Soon Michael was swapping his old clothes for new, smaller-sized tops and trousers.

As the pounds disappeared Mr Wareing found that he could go and and play with his kids like he used to

She said: ‘He had the energy to run around the park and play football with them. We got on better and four months later, got back together.’

In December 2010, April fell pregnant again and was able to wear Michael’s old clothes as maternity wear when she was six months pregnant.

In August 2011, Michael – who by now had lost 16 stone – had a gastric bypass to help him lose more weight.

Kieren-Lee and Liam could now stand up in their father’s jeans, one in each leg.

April said: ‘They were so big they called them Daddy’s Tents.’

In September 2011, the couple’s daughter, Kaevyanne, was born and in October Michael proposed.

Michael now works as a kitchen porter in a takeaway.

April said: ‘Michael can still eat kebabs but they need to be much smaller and the meat has to be dry, not greasy or fatty.’

In December 2014, Miss Roy gave birth to the couple’s third son Arran and are now planning their wedding.

Mr Wareing is now more involved in his bringing up the children.

He said: ‘I have a lot more energy now so I can go out and play with the kids. I take the dog out. I walk everywhere.

‘I’m a lot happier and feel more confident. April and my mum gave me a boost, and losing weight changed my life. Now I look back and think, why did I let myself go?’

Miss Roy cannot believe the life-changing results of the operation.

Miss Roy said: ‘I’m so proud of Michael and couldn’t be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.’
