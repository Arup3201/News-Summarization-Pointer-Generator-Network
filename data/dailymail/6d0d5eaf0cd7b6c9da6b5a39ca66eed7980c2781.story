An emotional Bode Miller has become the oldest ever Olympic Alpine medalist after he tied for bronze in a thrilling men’s super-G race at the Sochi Olympics on Sunday.

The 36-year-old won his sixth career Olympic medal, spread over 12 years, and now has sole possession of second place on the all-time men’s Alpine medal list.

Miller teared up as he hugged wife, professional volleyball player Morgan Miller, after the race and the two shared several kisses including an extra special intimate moment as she pressed the hood of coat up close against his helmet.

The last year has been a difficult one for Miller: the death of his younger brother, Chelone, in April 2013; the court fight over custody of his infant son; the work it took to come back from left knee surgery and return to the Alpine apex.

‘To be on the podium, it’s a really big day for me,’ said Miller, who placed eighth in downhill and sixth in super-combined. ‘Emotionally, I had a lot riding on it. I'm super, super happy.’

Wife Morgan has been with him every step of the way and was the first to congratulate him after his latest medal success. She was also quick to praise her husband's achievements and his resilience.

'After the year we've had, and the fact we just keep pushing through it,' she said, 'it just shows how resilient Bode is.'

Miller wiped away tears in the finish area after someone mentioned Chelone, a charismatic snowboarder who was 29 and hoping to make the U.S. team in Sochi when he died of what was believed to be a seizure.

'Everything felt pretty raw and pretty connected,' Miller said, 'so it was a lot for me.'

Later he took to Twitter to honor his brother: 'Thanks for all the support, today was one of the most emotional days of my life. I miss my brother.'

Gold in the event was taken by Norweigan Kjetil Jansrud, 28.  It was his country’s fourth straight super-G gold, and fifth in the past seven Winter Games.

American Andrew Weibrecht, charged late at Jansrud’s time of 1 minute, 18.14 seconds to take a surprise silver, edging teammate Miller and Jan Hudec of Canada into a tie for bronze.

‘It’s big, insane,’ Jansrud said of Norway’s dominance in super-G, a discipline that challenges racers to be fast and technically correct through a gate-setting they have never practiced. They are allowed a one-hour, early-morning course inspection.

‘Somehow when you come to the Olympic Games, Norwegians are on the top of the podium and that is impossible to describe,’ he said. ‘It feels perfect so far.’

Jansrud singled out Miller as one of his own idols.

‘He was already winning races when I was a little kid. He has been one of my heroes,’ Jansrud told The Associated Press. ‘He has had such an amazing career.’

Miller, who started No. 13, took the lead with an exhilarating run, though he lost time going off line down the steep final slope after making the final jump.

Weibrecht peaked at the Olympics for the second time in an injury-ravaged career. Nicknamed ‘War Horse,’ the Lake Placid, N.Y., native has blown out each ankle and gone through surgeries on both shoulders since the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, where he got super-G bronze.

He lost his sponsorship from the U.S. ski team after a string of lackluster results, but that didn’t make him any less of a threat in the eyes of the other skiers.

‘With Andrew at the start, I was like, “There’s a good chance he wins this run right now,'’’ said Miller, who took silver in the super-G at Vancouver.

The Americans shared the podium again Sunday. And, again, there was a Norwegian standing above them.
