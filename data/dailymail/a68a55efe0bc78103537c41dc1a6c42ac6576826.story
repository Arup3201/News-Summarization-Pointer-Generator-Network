A young cancer patient whose dying wishlist touched the hearts of the nation has died.

Stephanie Knight, 21,  had been bravely battling the rare bone cancer  Ewings Sarcoma since she was 17, losing her right leg and part of her pelvis.

But rather than dwell on her fate, the former teaching assistant made a bucket list of 50 things she wanted to do before she died.

Stephanie Knight (left, aged 16, before she became ill) had been bravely battling the rare bone cancer Ewings Sarcoma since she was 17, losing her right leg and part of her pelvis. She died this week aged 21

These included meeting Take That star Gary Barlow finishing her university degree and meeting the street magician Dynamo.

Her story inspired MailOnline readers and hundreds got in touch to offer their support and offer what help they could.

One poignant last wish was to be a bride for a day and although she never got to walk down the aisle, her friends threw a mock hen party for her.

Stephanie’s mother Cindy, 58, announced her daugher's death in a farewell message on Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday evening.

It said: 'Our beautiful and brave Stephanie fell asleep at 5.45pm and she was with her family and pets and was very peaceful.

'She will now watch over us all with her fairy wings and dazzling eyes that will shine bright in the night sky.

'Since September 2009 we have been side 
by side with our Steph on a journey that no parent wants to make and no 
family wants to be passengers on.

'Stephanie was only here for 21 years but her courage and kindness and what she inspired will be marked in history forever and she will be smiling about that.

'So as our angel goes up to heaven to find her baby brother and look after him until we see them both again I hope you will all continue to follow Stephs legacy and be inspired to help others and achieve whatever makes you happy.

'Steph had a good four months [after the diagnosis that her cancer was terminal] to do most of her wishes and more importantly for Steph to make new memories with the people she loved the most for them to remember always and she achieved that 100 per cent.

Steph's mother Cindy said: 'We are now faced with life without our beautiful, brave, loving and inspirational daughter/sister/granddaughter/auntie/cousin and friend and at the moment this breaks our hearts in two'

'We are now faced with life without our beautiful, brave,loving and inspirational daughter/ sister/granddaughter/auntie/cousin and friend and at the moment this breaks our hearts in two and we feel like lost souls without our Stephanie.'

The message added: 'Steph was lucky to be able to tick off many of the wishes on her bucket list and received a few surprises along the way, including the visit of Gary Barlow.'

After hearing of her death Gary Barlow tweeted: 'Lets all say a prayer for Stephanie Knight tonight! Beautiful girl.'

Stephanie, from Braughing, Hertfordshire, was diagnosed with the disease when she was just17 after doctors found a tumour the size of a tennis ball behind her pelvis.

Gary Barlow's tribute to Steph, who died on Wednesday

Over the next four years she raised more than £40,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

After her plight came to to light in January, the public and celebrities
joined forces to make the last few months of her life as special as 
they could be. In late February, Stephanie had the rather 
surreal experience of having Gary Barlow singing in her living room.

He had dropped in for a cup of tea 
and an impromptu sing song after hearing about Stephanie's story from 
his friend Amanda Holden.

His band mate Robbie Williams is currently in 
Los Angeles, but he sent a special note and photo to Steph after he was 
contacted by Sarah, Duchess of York.

At
the time she told MailOnline : 'It has been truly overwhelming - 
sometimes I'm afraid to smile because I know I will just cry with 
happiness!'

The Duchess also sent a big basket of
goodies for Steph's 'fake' hen night at the local pub, as well as a 
framed photo of a sunset she had taken in Greece. Her office is helping 
Steph's family to set up their own charity.

One
of Steph's favourite days was enjoying a 'typical drunken night out' at
the Ice Bar in London. They were treated like VIPs by the manager with 
free cocktails and a photographer on hand.

It's magic: Dynamo showed off a number of card tricks and managed to guess which card Steph was thinking of

'It
was a really great experience. I felt well that day, which was unusual 
as I often have to escape to have a rest,' Steph said.

Another rite of passage Steph experienced was her own fake hen night, replete with 44 female friends 
and family and some topless waiters.

She also met the Tottenham Hotspur football team - because she loves being able to treat her family.

'My brother Lloyd has been a Tottenham fan since he was little. He's 25 but he turned into a hormonal teenager when he met them!' she said.

'I loved watching his reactions. We got to see the team training and then speak to them afterwards.

'AVB (the manager Andre Villas Boas) gave Lloyd his jacket and whistle, which was a huge deal.'

Footballer Jermain Defoe said: 'It was great for us 
to meet Stephanie. She is an inspirational person and, when we saw that 
meeting us was on her wish list, we were determined to make that happen.'

Steph also ticked off other wishes including meeting the magician Dynamo who amazed her with his card tricks and completing her childcare qualifications.

Mrs Knight said before her daughter's death: 'Steph has been teaching as a nursery nurse nearby. It's what she's wanted to do from the age of 11.

'She does one-to-ones helping them 
with their reading and writing. She is often given the more challenging 
ones as she has a way with her that they really respond to. Spending time in the school makes her feel normal.'

Steph is now setting up a charity, 
called Steph's Wishes, after receiving so many donations via her 
website. It will help 18 to 24-year-olds who have cancer, especially 
those who have relapsed.

'The first time you have cancer who go in so positive,' Steph said.

'But
the second time you know what's coming and you start to question 
whether the treatment will work as it didn't the first time.

'I want the charity to fund bucket list wishes whether it's a day out or to meet someone special.'

And despite all the hardships she has been through she said before she died that she wouldn't have changed anything.

'I'm a better person because of this and we're closer as a family,' she said.

'We shrug off the small things now as they don't matter. We take lots of pictures and laugh.

'If I could give one bit of advice I would say don't take life so seriously. Just try and enjoy every minute of it.'
