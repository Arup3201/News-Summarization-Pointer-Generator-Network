The 37-year-old Australian can  be seen enjoying her new Bali lifestyle in the photos with her sister Mercedes and a group of friends who are drinking alcoholic beverages and dancing.

Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby (pictured in the front in a black top) has been spotted out partying with friends in Bali despite being on strict parole

She is expected to stay with Mercedes and her husband under her tight parole conditions and has been warned to stay away from drugs and crime during the remainder of her time in Bali. 

Corby has been told by Indonesian authorities that she must stay in the country until mid-2017.

Pictured at Sky Garden in popular clubbing spot Kuta just before Christmas, Schapelle is surrounded by a big group of friends and her sister Mercedes, who are all clearly languishing in Bali's party atmosphere.

Dressed in a black frilly t-shirt and short black mini skirt, Schapelle is front and centre in the revealing photos, smiling from ear-to ear as strobe lights and lasers fill the background .

Another image from the same night shows disgraced former NRL star Todd Carney, who had been pictured in July partying with Schapelle and her sister. 

The image went viral, with many people questioning why the two Australians were living it up in Bali.

In the old snap, the sacked Cronulla Sharks player has his tattooed arms draped over the sisters' shoulders and a big smile on his face. 

In the new picture, Carney is standing beside a DJ friend, who is also pictured in other numerous other photos with Schapelle.

29-year-old Carney escaped Australia after his 'bubbling' scandal, which showed the sportsman urinating into his own mouth in a lewd photograph taken in a hotel toilet.

The 'bubbling' photo was and leaked on social media and led to him being sacked from his team.  

Deciding to exclude herself from this photo, Schapelle's sister Mercedes poses with her friends 

Until 2017, Corby is required to stay in Bali, and report monthly to the Bali corrections board, dress respectfully for the officials and not use or distribute drugs in Bali

Corby was sentenced to 20 years behind bars in 2005 but was later granted a five-year sentence reduction.

While imprisoned, Corby claimed she suffered from extreme depression and shared with a psychiatrist her thoughts on suicide. 

She now lives with her sister, Mercedes, in the tourist area of Kuta and appears to have slipped nicely into a tight group of partying friends.

In August 2014 Schapelle told her parole officer that she was spending her outside prison time reading and on the beach rather than searching for work. 

However, judging from these candid photos, she has now branched out and has added clubbing to her post-prison routine. 

Schapelle's group of friends are made up of DJs and family members, with some photos even showing her celebrating her mother's birthday in Badung.

Obviously delighted to be spending her first birthday with her daughter in nearly ten years, Rosleigh cuddles up to Schapelle in the photos taken at a Bali restaurant, as she blows out candles on a birthday cake. 

In another photo of the happy family, a group of nine family members sit around a table adorned with beers and stubby holders.  

The Sydney Morning Herald previously cited a parole document signed by Schapelle Corby that  'If I [Corby] cannot fulfil those requirements, I'm ready to be sent back to prison to undergo the rest of the sentence.'

Until 2017, Corby is required to stay in Bali, and report monthly to the Bali corrections board, dress respectfully for the officials and not use or distribute drugs in Bali.

The approved parole application also highlights Corby's ambitions to design bikinis for her brother-in-law's Kuta surf shop.

A month after her release in February, Corby's parole was on the line, following her sister's controversial interview with Seven Network program, Sunday Night.

Pressure for Schapelle's re-arrest mounted, as Indonesian media networks criticised the Corby family over the interview which speculated that the 4.1 kilograms of marijuana in Schapelle's boogie board bag 'could have been from Indonesia'. 

Just three months after being released from jail she has been spending time with her Indonesian ex-

boyfriend Ben Panangian, who supported her while she was locked-up. The two are believed to now be no more than friends.

He was  caught with marijuana after he was searched on a Bali street on August 20 and police later found more in his wardrobe.

The 32-year-old was sentenced in December to 10 months in prison for possessing 8.2g of marijuana in three packages.

The shocking pictures of Schapelle come just after the families of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan, 31, and Myarun Sukumaran, 33,  made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates.

Schapelle spend nine years behind bars and was released on parole in February last year 

Both Chan and Sukumaran attempted to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia and into Australia ten years ago. It is believed they will only be given 72 hours notice before they will be executed by gunfire. 

Last Thursday, Chan's last ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Widodo, following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia.

Chan and Sukumaran, along with seven others, tried to traffic 8.3 kilograms of heroin out of Bali but were intercepted by Indonesian police.

The relatives of Chan and Sukumaran said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail.

'I come here to ask pardon from the president, the president and the people of Indonesia, to forgive my grandson and give him a second chance,' she said, addressing the crowd. 

'I don't ask him to come home. I only ask him to give him life and let him do something in the prison.

'Don't kill him, please don't kill him.'

Actor David Wenham was Master of Ceremonies for the event, which featured performances from Justine Clarke, Glenn Richards from Augie March, Midnight Oil's Rob Hirst and Steve Kilby from The Church.
