The House of Representatives won't move to impeach President Barack Obama, and the idea is 'all a scam started by Democrats at the White House,' House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday.

'This whole talk about impeachment is coming from the president's own staff, and coming from Democrats on Capitol Hill,' Boehner told reporters.

'Why? Because they’re trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year's elections.'

On Monday the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee emailed its largest donor list with a request for money based specifically on impeachment fears.

SCAM: Boehner said Democrats have cooked up baseless impeachment fears in order to raise money

Smoking gun: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee begged donors for money on Monday by floating the idea that Republicans could impeach the president

The 
president, vice president and first lady, the solicitation read, 'need 
your help, because it’s a critical moment. House Republicans will vote 
THIS WEEK to sue the President. And the White House believes it could 
lead to Barack Obama’s impeachment.'

'It’s
 time to have the President’s back. With the most critical deadline 
we’ve faced in just days, we’re still 75,000 donations short of our 
goal.'

Adding fuel to Boehner's contention, a top White House aide used the 'I' word on Friday during a Christian Science Monitor breakfast event, tying the threat of impeachment to a lawsuit Boehner is pursuing against the Obama administration.

The legal action, Dan Pfeiffer said, has 'opened the door' to a presidential impeachment.

'Impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied about by the recent Republican vice presidential nominee and others in a very un-serious way,' said Pfeiffer, hat-tipping former Alaska governor Sarah Palin.

'We take it very seriously and I don't think it would be a good thing.'

Palin said of Obama just days ago in Denver that 'if he's not impeachable, then no one is.'

Boehner has said plainly that his lawsuit, which focuses on the White House's unilateral changes to the Obamacare law, will not be a prelude to removing Obama from power.

'This is not about impeachment,' the House speaker said on July 9. 'This is about faithfully executing the laws of our country.'

He added a more definitive statement on Tuesday, saying that the House leadership has 'no plans to impeach the president. We have no future plans.'

Staying: Obama doesn't face an impeachment threat, Boehner said, preferring to take the president to federal court over his administration's changes to the Affordable Care Act

Impeachment refers to a formal process prescribed in the U.S. Constitution for throwing a president or a federal judge out of office.

The House would first bring charges against Obama and vote to approve them. The Senate would then hold a trial on those charges and vote on whether to convict.

The Constitution reserves impeachment as a remedy for 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' which the framers understood to be official crimes committed while in power.

Boehner and other House leaders have tried to tamp down conservative Republicans' expectations in recent weeks.

A senior House staffer told MailOnline that Tuesday's words would be welcome in establishment circles since Democrats' control of the Senate makes removing Obama from office a guaranteed non-starter.

'It shouldn't have taken this long for him to say it, but now that he's said it we can get back to things that won't backfire,' the aide said.

A CNN/ORC International poll released on Friday found that one-third of Americans, 33 per cent, believe Obama should be impeached and removed from office. Fully 65 per cent disagreed.
