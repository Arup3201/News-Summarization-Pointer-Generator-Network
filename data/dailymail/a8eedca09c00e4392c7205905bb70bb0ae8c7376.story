Investigators have found no initial evidence of engine or gearbox failure in their probe into the police helicopter crash in Glasgow which claimed nine lives.

The helicopter crashed on to the flat roof of the The Clutha Vaults on 
the night of November 29 with a high rate of descent and with low or 
negligible forward speed, a special bulletin from the Air Accidents 
Investigation Branch (AAIB) revealed.

The exact cause of the crash is still unclear following the interim report, with the AAIB saying that the weather was good, that so far there was no evidence of engine or gearbox
failure and that 'all significant components were present' at the time 
of impact.

Probe: The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has found no evidence of engine failure in the police helicopter which crashed through the roof of The Clutha Bar in Scotland, killing the three people on board and six more inside the pub

Working order: In a special bulletin, the AAIB said 'all significant components were present' at the time the two-engined Eurocopter EC135 helicopter crashed through the roof

In addition, the helicopter still had 95 litres of the 400kg of fuel that it had taken off with from Glasgow City Heliport.

The AAIB said the twin-engined Eurocopter EC 135 aircraft had no flight 
recorders, nor was required to do so. But there were some non 
crash-protected system recordings that could be studied along with radio
communications and closed circuit TV recordings.

Saying that the investigation would continue, the AAIB promised to report any significant developments.

The pilot of the helicopter David Traill, 51, and his two passengers - 
police officers Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43 - were killed in 
the crash as were six people inside the pub.

Mission: Rescue workers lift the police helicopter wreckage from the roof of The Clutha following the devastating crash

Poignant: Flowers and tributes left at the scene of the helicopter crash

Today's bulletin traced the events of the night of the crash.

In 
good visibility and light winds, the helicopter had left Glasgow City 
Heliport at 8.45pm, gone first to the south side of the city, then on to
Dalkeith in Midlothian about 40 miles away before returning to Glasgow.

The pilot had requested and received clearance from air traffic 
controllers to re-enter the Glasgow control zone at 10.18pm and there 
were no further radio transmissions received from him.

Return journey: Helicopter pilot and crash victim David Traill, 51, had been on his way back to the Glasgow City Heliport when the aircraft was seen falling from the sky

The AAIB added that radar contact with the helicopter was lost at 10.22pm.

The report went on: 'Around this time, the helicopter was seen and heard
by a witness who described hearing a noise like a loud "misfiring car",
followed by silence.

'He then saw the helicopter descend rapidly. It crashed through the roof
of The Clutha Bar, a single-storey building on Stockwell Street in 
central Glasgow.'

The report said that initial evidence indicated that the helicopter 
struck the flat roof of the pub 'with a high rate of descent and 
low/negligible forward speed'.

The three occupants of the 
helicopter and six people in, or adjacent to, the bar were fatally 
injured. Thirty two other people suffered injuries, 12 seriously.'

The six who died inside the pub were 
Robert Jenkins, 61, Mark O'Prey, 44, Colin Gibson, 33, John McGarrigle, 
57, Gary Arthur, 48, and Samuel McGhee, 56.

The AAIB went on: 'Preliminary examination showed that all main rotor 
blades were attached at the time of the impact but that neither the main
rotor nor the fenestron tail rotor (a form of protected tail rotor) 
were rotating.

'The impact forces caused the roof of the bar to collapse and (the) 
helicopter entered the building, its forward section coming to rest on 
and amongst building debris.

'Very extensive damage and disruption of the helicopter structure and 
components resulted from the impact forces and from contact with the 
collapsing building. The helicopter did, however, remain approximately 
upright.'

On duty: Police constables Tony Colins, 43, and Kirsty Nellis, 36, were both on board the helicopter when it crashed, killing them both and their civilian pilot

Victims: Window cleaner Mark O'Prey, 44, and Samuel McGhee, 56, had both been inside the pub

The AAB said its team, working closely with the emergency services and 
the authorities in Glasgow, had conducted a preliminary examination of 
the aircraft within the collapsed area of the pub.

After that, the damaged sections of 
the building were shored up and made safe, 'enabling closer examination 
to be carried out'.

The report went on: 'Initial assessment provided no evidence of major 
mechanical disruption of either engine and indicated that the main rotor
gearbox was capable of providing drive from the No 2 engine turbine to 
the main rotor and to the fenestron drive shaft.'

However, the state of the building 
limited the extent to which examination of the helicopter was possible 
at the scene, the AAIB added.

The report continued: 'After further 
debris removal and cutting off the main rotor blade, it was determined 
that the helicopter structure remained sufficiently robust for it to be 
lifted clear of the building by means of a crane, using strops attached 
to the main rotor head.

'Once removed from the building, approximately 95 litres of fuel were drained from the fuel tank system.'

John McGarrigle, 57, was killed in the disaster, as was 48-year-old Gary Arthur, who was the first victim to be named by police

The helicopter was then transferred to its headquarters at Farnborough in Hampshire.

The AAIB promised to report any significant developments as the investigation progressed.

The
pilots' union Balpa said: 'The information published by the AAIB today 
is a helpful first assessment of the facts of the case and suggests 
there is no evidence of mechanical engine failure.

'But,
unfortunately, at this stage, there is not much more to go on and the 
reasons behind the crash are, in truth, far from clear. The AAIB must be
given the time to complete its thorough investigation and we have faith
in their ability to do so.'

The special bulletin was released on the same day that the families of two victims gathered together to mark their funerals.

Friends of Mark O'Prey attended a service in his home town of East Kilbride, South 
Lanarkshire, where hundreds of mourners packed into St Bride's RC Church
to pay their respects.

Among them were pupils from the nearby St Andrew's and St Bride's school, which Mr O'Prey's son Liam, 15, attends.

Mourning: The special bulletin from investigators came as friends and family of one of the nine victims, 44-year-old Mark O'Prey marked his funeral at St Bride's Church in East Kilbride

Last week, the family of Mr O'Prey described him as a 'lovable giant' and they believe he died while trying to help others escape the pub.

Just a few miles away, mourners gathered to pay their last respects to Mr Arthur in Paisley.

He was the first of the crash victims to be publicly named in the days following the incident.

The humanist service at Woodside 
Crematorium was estimated to have been attended by 400 to 500 people, 
many of whom had to stand outside.

In a statement released ahead of the 
funeral, Mr Arthur's family said: 'We loved him dearly and always will, 
we will miss him so much.'

On Saturday, Around 700 mourners gathered for the service for helicopter pilot captain David Traill, 51, and prayers were said for all of those who died in the crash.
