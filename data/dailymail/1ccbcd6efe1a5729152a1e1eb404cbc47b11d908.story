Four were injured on Thursday after a whirlwind outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California sent tents flying and witnesses along with a cow mascot running for their lives.

YouTube user adsport caught the windstorm on camera and footage of the event has over 2 million views since being posted online on December 31.

The San Gabriel Valley Tribune reports that the strong gusts of wind began at around 2 p.m. in Lot H of the College Football game the Rose Bowl just one day before Oregon played Florida State in the College Semi-finals in the same location.

Up in the air: The wind picks up a canopy as witnesses, one dressed as a cow run away 

'A strong gust of wind blew a large framed canopy up in the air,' Pasadena police Lt. Marie Sell said.

Adsport was lucky enough to safely capture film of the wind making its way through the lot lifting up canopies along the way.

Witnesses shrieked and fled the scene as quickly as they could to avoid getting injured by the powerful winds. 

Paramedics treated three men and one woman on the scene but no one wanted to be taken to the hospital.

'It could have been a lot worse,' Pasadena Fire Department spokeswoman Lisa Derderian said.

Help was on the scene of around 20 people within seconds.

While the lot was windy, it was not a tornado as some speculated.
