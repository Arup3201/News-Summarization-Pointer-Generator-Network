The violent past of the father who killed his two sons and then himself emerged last night.

Graham Anderson had been jailed last year for attacking the boys’ mother, Victoria Jones.

The bodies of their boys, 11-year-old Jack and three-year-old Bryn, were found at their rented family home in Tidworth, Wiltshire, on Saturday.

Anderson had hanged himself in another room. His landlady made the horrific discovery when she let herself in to the flat to show prospective tenants around.

Police are trying to determine how and when the children died.

Friends say Anderson, an unemployed removal man, was a jealous brute whose 16-year relationship with Miss Jones was punctuated with violence and accusations of infidelity.

The 36-year-old is said to have snapped when he found out she had moved on and settled down with another man.

‘Everyone knew what he was like,’ 
said a school friend. ‘He was always violent towards Victoria. He made 
her life a living hell. They were constantly getting into rows and he 
would turn really nasty.

'He was a very jealous type. One time 
after they split up, he went round to her house and smashed the whole 
place up to get back at her. He broke all the windows.

‘When he found out Victoria was moving on with someone else, something must have just snapped in his brain.’

Anderson
 was jailed for six months last August for multiple assaults on Miss 
Jones and a friend he suspected of sleeping with her. Magistrates in 
Basingstoke, Hampshire, were told he had punched, slapped and pushed the
 31-year-old to the ground during a series of violent rows in July last 
year.

Despite the brutality 
Miss Jones appealed for clemency for Anderson, telling magistrates she 
hoped to get the family back together.

However
 she had recently formed a new relationship and, in the early hours of 
August 26, changed her status on her Facebook page from single to being 
in a relationship.

Anderson won custody of his sons in May after they had spent some time in foster care.

Detectives
 yesterday released a photograph of him in an appeal for help in finding
 out what he and his sons were doing in the days before they died.

 ‘It
 is very important that we establish the movements of Graham Anderson 
and the boys between Saturday August 25 and Saturday September 1,’ said 
Detective Chief Inspector Ian Saunders, who is leading the murder 
investigation.

‘We are gathering CCTV footage from shops in Tidworth and from buses which run through the town.

‘He
 was a regular bus user and I now need to trace his movements and those 
of the boys during the week leading up to the discovery of their bodies 
at lunchtime on Saturday.’

Uniformed officers were still on guard outside the flat yesterday.

Dozens of well-wishers yesterday left flowers and teddy bears at the entrance to the block.
