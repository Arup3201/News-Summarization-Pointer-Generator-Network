Researchers claim to have found fresh physical evidence the Moon was created when a body the size of Mars smashed into the early Earth in a cataclysmic collision.

Analysis of lunar rocks brought back by the Apollo missions shows they have heavier forms of zinc - a telltale sign of the impact billions of years ago.

Without the Moon there may have been no life on Earth because it once orbited much closer to us than it does now causing massive tides to ebb and flow every few hours.

Researcher say new analysis of lunar rocks prove the Moon was created when a body the size of Mars smashed into the early Earth in a cataclysmic collision.

These tides caused dramatic fluctuations in salinity around coastlines which are believed to have driven the evolution of primitive DNA-like biomolecules.

Planetary scientist Dr Frederic Moynier says the zinc enrichment probably arose because heavier atoms condensed out of the cloud of vaporized rock quicker than lighter onces.

His researchers analysed 20 samples of Moon rocks including ones from the Apollo 11, 12, 15 and 17 missions - all of which went to different locations - and one lunar meteorite.

Dr Moynier, of Washington University in St Louis, said: 'What we wanted were the basalts because they’re the ones that came from inside the Moon and would be more representative of the Moon’s composition.'

 According to the Giant Impact Theory, proposed in its modern form at a 
conference in 1975, Earth's moon was created in a apocalyptic collision 
between a planetary body called Theia (in Greek mythology the mother of 
the moon Selene) and the early Earth.

This collision was so powerful it is 
hard for mere mortals to imagine, but the asteroid that killed the 
dinosaurs is thought to have been the size of Manhattan, whereas Theia 
is thought to have been the size of the planet Mars.

The smashup released so much energy 
it melted and vaporized Theia and much of the proto-Earth's mantle.

The 
Moon then condensed out of the cloud of rock vapor, some of which also 
re-accreted to the Earth.

Scientists have been looking for this kind of sorting by mass - called isotopic fractionation - since the Apollo missions first brought Moon rocks to Earth in the 1970s.

Compared to terrestrial or Martian rocks the lunar rocks have much lower concentrations of zinc but are enriched in the heavy isotopes of zinc.

'The magnitude of the fractionation we 
measured in lunar rocks is 10 times larger than what we see in 
terrestrial and Martian rocks,' Moynier says, 'so it's an important 
difference.'

Earth and Mars have isotopic compositions like those of chondritic meteorites, which are thought to represent the original composition of the cloud of gas and dust from which the solar system formed.

The most likely large-scale event is wholesale melting during the formation of the Moon.

The zinc isotopic data therefore supports the theory a giant impact gave rise to the Earth-Moon system.

Dr Moynier, whose study is published in Nature, said: 'The work also has implications for the origin of the Earth because the origin of the Moon was a big part of the origin of the Earth.'

Without the stabilising influence of the Moon the Earth would probably be a very different sort of place.

Scientists think the Earth would spin more rapidly, days would be shorter, weather more violent and climate more chaotic and extreme.

In fact it might have been such a harsh world it would have been unfit for the evolution of humans.

Asked how he felt when he saw the first 
results, Moynier says, 'When you find something that is new and that has
 important ramifications, you want to be sure you haven't gotten 
anything wrong.

'I half expected results like those previously obtained for moderately 
volatile elements, so when we got something so different, we reproduced 
everything from scratch to make sure there were no mistakes because some
 of the procedures in the lab could conceivably fractionate the 
isotopes.'

The data, published in the Oct. 18, 
2012, issue of Nature, provide the first physical evidence for wholesale
 vaporization event since the discovery of volatile depletion in Moon 
rocks, Moynier says.

A new theory put forward by Harvard scientists in a seperate study suggests the Moon was once part of the Earth that spun off after a giant collision with another body.

In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science, Sarah Stewart and Matija Ćuk said their theory would explain why the Earth and Moon have similar composition and chemistry.

The Earth was spinning much faster at the time the Moon was formed, and a day lasted only two to three hours, they said.

With the Earth spinning so quickly, a giant impact could have launched enough of the Earth's material to form a moon, the scientists said.

According to the new theory, the Earth later reached its current rate of spinning through gravitational interaction between its orbit around the Sun and the Moon's orbit around Earth.

The scientists noted that their proposition differed from the current leading theory, which holds that the Moon was created from material from a giant body that struck the Earth.

Stewart is a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Harvard, and Ćuk, an astronomer and an investigator at the SETI Institute, which supports research into the search for extraterrestrial life.

The latter was conducting post-doctoral research at Harvard.
