Derby County are facing an investigation by the Football Association after a supporter invaded the pitch and threw punches at Nottingham Forest’s Kelvin Wilson, while Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi later claimed his car had been vandalised.

The supporter ran on to the playing surface seconds after the final whistle following his team’s late surrender of a lead in the east Midlands derby, twice swinging for the defender.

Team-mate Jack Hobbs grabbed the thug before four stewards bundled the man away.

A 23-year-old from Derby has been arrested in connection with the incident and police also confirmed cars and a bus were damaged in a car park.

Superintendent Gary Parkin said: ‘At the end of the match there were some tensions at the south end of the stadium where the Derby County and Nottingham Forest fans meet.

‘One man walked on to the pitch from the Derby end and appeared to come into contact with the Nottingham Forest defender Kelvin Wilson.’

The club are likely to be charged with failing to control their supporters while the supporter could receive a life ban.

Trouble continued after the game with Forest owner Al-Hasawi posting a picture of damage to his Mercedes on Twitter.

The picture showed a missing number plate and damage to the wheels and a Forest spokesman said the club may seek compensation.

Al-Hasawi, who was pictured on television celebrating wildly after Ben Osborne made it 2-1 to Forest, tweeted: ‘Very professional! But in the end I don’t mind at all! The three points are more important!’
