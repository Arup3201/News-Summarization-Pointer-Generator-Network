Manchester City aimed to put their Community Shield loss behind them as they trained ahead of their Premier League opener against Newcastle.

Manuel Pellegrini's side were disappointing in their 3-0 defeat to Arsenal, but both the morale and the motivation appeared to have returned as they trained at Carrington.

Frank Lampard and Sergio Aguero were among a host of players unavailable to play on Sunday, but both were pictured training today and could play against Newcastle.

The Chilean manager spoke about his squad, and what he thinks will be different this year.

He told Sky Skports: 'Last year we were in a different position than now. Now maybe I know the players a little more. They know me, they know the way I want to play.

New boy: Pellegrini was pleased he had convinced Frank Lampard to join, calling him a 'very important player'

Training: Pablo Zabaleta, David Silva, Frank Lampard and Micah Richards training at Carrington 

'I am happy with the squad because I think we are a stronger squad now than we were last year. 

'Bacary Sagna, Fernando, Caballero, Frank Lampard and Eliaquim Mangala are five players that give us something very important in defence and I hope attacking-wise we will be the same as last year because we have four important strikers and good midfielders.

'Lampard is a very important player for us. He has a lot of experience, he is a very important English player. 

'He had nothing to do until January with New York City – I proposed to him that he come here because I think he is a great player.'

Pace: Jesus Navas played against Arsenal but Sergio Aguero was not considered fit enough

Meanwhile, Manager Pellegrini admitted he must trim his squad before adding any further recruits, as City fight to comply with Financial Fair Play constraints.

Porto capture Eliaquim Mangala could be City's final summer signing unless the club can offload Sinclair and Guidetti, Pellegrini conceded.

'It's not finished, until the last day we can do different things,' said Pellegrini at the Premier League launch.

'But if you ask me at this moment if I am happy with the squad, yes I am very happy with my squad.

Happy: There were rumours that Yaya Toure wanted to quit the champions but the Ivorian refuted them

'We had a lot of problems also with Financial Fair Play with the restriction of the amount of players we can put in our squad.

'So maybe I don't think that we are going to sign another player because we cannot do it.

'We have maybe too many players in the squad at this moment, players that need to play, that's very important, especially for young players.

'John Guidetti or maybe Scott Sinclair, they may need to play in a different team, so we'll see from now until the end of the transfer window what happens with our squad.

'But at this moment, yes we have too many players.'

Form: After Alvaro Negredo and Segio Aguero were injured last season, Edin Dzeko had a good run of form

Pellegrini has added Bacary Sagna, Fernando, Willy Caballero, Frank Lampard and Bruno Zuculini to the champions' squad, along with Mangala this summer.

City expect to stay within the £49million spending limit imposed by UEFA for last term's FFP breaches, while Pellegrini is also mindful of sticking to the reduced 21-man squad cap.

Feyenoord are understood to be keen on completing a permanent deal for 22-year-old Sweden forward Guidetti, who enjoyed a loan stint with the Dutch club in 2011-12.

Sinclair joined Manchester City from Swansea in 2012, but has made just three starts in his two years at the Etihad Stadium.

Competition: Joe Hart faces competition from Willy Caballero for his starting place this season

The 25-year-old admitted after Sunday's 3-0 Community Shield defeat to Arsenal that he would seek a move if he cannot secure regular first-team football.

Refusing to prioritise the Champions League this term, Pellegrini said City cannot use FFP constraints as an excuse.

'It's easy to give excuses, but I don't like to do that,' he said.

'I'll always field the strongest team and we want to win every time we play, and in every competition.

Retired: Samir Nasri, who has retired from international football, had a poor game against his former club 

'You don't have five or six teams in any other major league where any one of them can win the title.

'So the Premier League is still the most important league, and it's important for us also.'

City start the defence of their Premier League title by facing Newcastle at St James' Park on Sunday.

Pellegrini admitted he is yet to rule on whether to restore Joe Hart to his line-up after omitting the England goalkeeper from the Community Shield starting team.

Argentinian keeper Caballero made his club debut in the Arsenal defeat at Wembley, after his summer move from Malaga.

The City manager defended his rotation policy, claiming he has his players' best interest in mind rather than sheer ruthlessness. 

Action: Manchester City begin their title defence this weekend when they travel to Newcastle

'The best way to have high performance is to have two competitive players in each position,' said Pellegrini.

'Nobody must be afraid of that: Joe Hart had a very good second part of the season last year.

'He's the best goalkeeper in England, but of course when he didn't play well last year we played (Costel) Pantilimon.

'It's impossible for a player to play 60 games in a year, to play 18 games during December and January as we did last season.

'It is sure that that player would be injured if that happened, so that's why it's so important to have two quality players in each position.

'I always decide the best team for each game, this week the same, and on Monday we will review Newcastle and start that process again.'
