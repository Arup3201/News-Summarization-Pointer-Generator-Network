Javier Hernandez is undergoing a medical with Real Madrid ahead of his imminent departure from Manchester United. 

United stand to make £17million if the deal  becomes permanent, but the original season-long loan agreement will see manager Louis van Gaal rake in £1.5m for the out-of-favour striker.

Real, who lost 4-2 to Real Sociedad in La Liga on Sunday night after selling Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso,  relinquished the fight for Monaco forward Radamel Falcao to United on Monday.

Real manager Carlo Ancelotti kept quiet about the move for 26-year-old Hernandez after the loss, but conceded that his side needed to change after letting a two-goal lead slip.

'This defeat changes nothing regarding the transfer market,' Ancelotti insisted. 

'It's our problem, of concentration. We have to work much harder not to make these mistakes. Something has to change and it's going to change.'

It comes as United won the race to sign Falcao from Monaco on a one-year loan ahead of rivals Manchester City and Real.

The striker will cost the Old Trafford club £12m and follows Di Maria, Daley Blind, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo in joining Van Gaal at the club.

The 28-year-old Colombian is yet to agree the formality of personal terms but will reportedly earn £200,000-a-week. He is believed to be on his way to Manchester in a private jet.
