Top fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld has added his magic to the new luxury Sofitel So Singapore.

The Chanel maestro has created stylish touches around the property, including lovely fluffy bathrobes complete with a red embroidered Lion Seal emblem.

Karl conjured up the symbol after being inspired by Singapore history’s own mythical lion.

It also features on the BooKube, an exclusive art piece bookend which also includes a quote from Lagerfeld, correspondence cards and check-in folders and door knobs.

The hotel, inspired by the opulence of 19th century French design, also boasts the world’s first Apple-based guest technology within its 134 rooms which means residents can use iPad minis as a remote control to activate the rooms’ functions and there are in-room iPhones.

There are also six So Lofty suites with Parisian style balconies and beautiful coloured skylights.

Sofitel So General Manager Tony Chisholm, who has promised ‘excellent hospitality experience from Sofitel combined with the playful luxury of the So label’, said: ‘We have developed a completely original concept for Singapore with the new Sofitel So Singapore.’

The hotel, which was first constructed in 1927, has also teamed up with MIAJA Design Group to create a welcoming atrium bathed in light, distinctive artworks throughout the property and themed wings like So Hip and So Heritage.

Sofitel So Singapore also features a fine dining restaurant, state-of-the-art spa and golf access. The hotel's signature restaurant and bar Xperience is described as an ‘experiential and interactive culinary journey of the senses.’ The chef's table is in the shape of a bed offering guests a unique dine-in-bed concept.

Guests can also chill in cabanas at the HI-SO, the elite rooftop bar, which has a gold-tiled infinity pool and offers 360-degree views of Singapore.

For the first 100 days of the hotel's opening those who book a room can receive a £60 in dining and drink credit.
