Debris was left strewn across a school's grounds after a pink limousine - which featured in the hit Channel 4 series Shameless - careered out of control and smashed through a set of gates.

The Lincoln Town Car is seen on CCTV demolishing the gates at Burnley College in Lancashire before accelerating through the car park and hitting a fence. The car was badly damaged but fortunately no-one was hurt.

Police said the driver lost control when the vehicle's brakes failed, forcing him to take evasive action.

Crash: The limo is seen on CCTV smashing through locked school gates at a school in Burnley

Out of control: The Lincoln Town car then careers through the car park out of control

Damage: The car crossed a football pitch before hitting a fence. It was badly damaged but fortunately nobody was hurt

Aftermath: Debris is scattered across the football pitch after the car (which can be seen where it came to rest in the background) ploughed through the fencing surrounding it

The driver reportedly hit the gates after taking a sharp bend outside Homebase store, before crossing on to the opposite side of the road.

The car, which is privately owned by a man from Warrington, Cheshire, who works in Burnley, was used by character Mickey Maguire in Shameless, written by Burnley-born Paul Abbott.

The footage has attracted more than 1,000 hits on YouTube since it was uploaded. PC Neil Goodison, from Lancashire 
police's Road Policing Unit, said that the incident, which happened earlier this month, could have been more serious.

Aftermath: Police said the driver lost control when the vehicle's brakes failed and he had to take evasive action

Rescued: The battered limo is loaded onto a recovery truck and taken away, leaving a trail of damage behind it

He said: 'The brakes of the limo had failed and the accelerator stuck as the man had been travelling down West Way. He decided to turn left onto Caldervale Road to try and cause the least danger to other people.

'He had gone across to the other side of the road as he turned the corner but managed to straighten out and smashed through the college fire gates which were locked, and knocked them completely off.

'The car eventually came to a stop as he drove the car into the astro-turf and crashed into the perimeter. It was extremely lucky that no-one was hurt. The pitch is usually used for matches at that time of day.Thankfully no-one was there that day.

Fame: The car achieved notoriety when it appeared in the Channel 4 TV series Shameless. It was owned in the programme by the character Mickey Maguire (pictured) played by Ciaran Griffiths)

'The front bonnet of the car was smashed in but the driver wasn't hurt, though he was a bit shocked by the incident.'

A spokesman from Burnley College said: 'A lot of people have been talking about the incident so we thought we would make a short film with the footage for people to see what happened.

'As far as we are aware the limo is the one used in Shameless. Even though the incident did cause quite a lot of damage no-one was hurt. It is lucky that it didn't happened half an hour earlier as a lot of students and staff would have been leaving college at that time.'
