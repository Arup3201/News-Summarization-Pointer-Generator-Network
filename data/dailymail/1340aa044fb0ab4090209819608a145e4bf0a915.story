Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson breezed through Heathrow today as they arrived back from a trip to India.

The pair looked relaxed and rested as Nico steered their trolley - piled high with luggage - through the London airport.

The dressed-down couple appeared to have caught the sun on their break - Pippa in particular looking pink-cheeked and glowing.

The couple looked rested and relaxed as they breezed through Heathrow aiport

Pippa dressed down for the long flight back from India, wearing her customary skinny jeans and an 'Ava' top from Cashmere by Tania and with a Coach Saffiano Tote

The couple are reported to have visited the Taj Mahal. It has become an extremely popular place to propose, thanks to the incredible beauty of the place, and also the romantic story behind its construction

Pippa wore a Peter Pan-collared top from
 Cashmere by Tania, a cream cardigan, her customary skinny jeans and 
tan, low-heeled ankle boots.

Her boyfriend, banker Nico Jackson, 36, was similarly casual in chunky navy knit over a checked shirt, paired with indigo jeans and battered Converse trainers.

Ever the gentleman, he steered their trolley, with its four pieces of luggage, through the airport.

They are believed to have visited the
 Taj Majal, in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. The mausoleum was built by 
Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal and 
is described as 'the jewel of Muslim art in India.' 

The pair were dressed down in jeans for their trip back from India, with Nico keeping it casual in battered grey Converse trainers.

The Taj Majal is used by thousands of male tourists each year to make marriage proposals

The couple went to the Caribbean in September, and were first photographed together in February while on a Middleton family holiday to Mustique

The pair appear to have packed an awful lot for a relatively short trip - lucky Nico was on hand to steer the heavily-loaded trolley

The destination is used by thousands of tourists each year to make marriage proposals.

A friend confided to the Mail on Sunday: ‘Pippa
 and Nico made a pact to travel to lots of exotic destinations before 
walking down the aisle to start a family. There will be lots of trips 
like this in coming months.’

According to the paper, Pippa and Nico are preparing to share some exciting news – their plans to marry next year.

Sources
 close to 36-year-old Nico claim he has asked friends and 
relatives to ‘prepare for a spring wedding’ and he hopes to make an 
official announcement this month.

The dressed-down couple didn't skimp on luggage, having four in total. How many were Pippa's we wonder?

 30, and Nico were first pictured together in February while on holiday 
in Mustique with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Middleton 
family

‘Nico
 can’t stop talking about it,’ said a chum of the Deutsche Bank 
stockbroker. ‘It’s been the source of much excitement among his friends.
 He and Pippa want everything to be just perfect.’

However there has been no official announcement and in September - over three months ago - Pippa denied she was engaged and added that an announcement was not imminent.

Perhaps Carole should wait a little longer to buy a hat.

In September, 
the couple went
 on another romantic break to the Caribbean, and also jetted off for a shooting weekend in October.

Former Edinburgh University student Pippa
 and Nico were seen laughing and giggling at the
 check-in desk before taking a low-cost flight from Inverness to London on their way back from a shoot in the Highlands.

The brisk December weather back in the UK must have been a bit of a shock to the sun-kissed couple
