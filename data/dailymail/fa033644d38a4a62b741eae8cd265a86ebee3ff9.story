A significant anniversary is approaching in Gareth Southgate’s career but there will be no cause for celebration.

For England’s Under 21 head coach, October 20, 2009 is never too far from his thoughts. It was the date he was sacked by Middlesbrough and a glance at the calendar is a reminder of how swiftly and brutally someone’s life in football can be turned upside down.

Southgate remembers that night with clarity. It started with Middlesbrough moving to a point off the top of the Championship with a slick 2-0 win over Derby but began unravelling when he walked into the boardroom and saw the look on Steve Gibson’s face. Then realisation dawned.

Yet as he revisits the episode during England’s preparations for the second leg of their European Championship play-off with Croatia, there is no bitterness or anger. While it may have been one of the worst things to happen to him, he knows the best came out of it.

‘Look, no question: losing your job is something that will affect anyone’s confidence,’ said Southgate, whose side will defend a 2-1 lead on Tuesday night. ‘Anyone who has been through that — no matter what you earn or what you have achieved in your life — it is a blow to the ego.

‘But in hindsight, it gave me the chance to learn and strengthen myself in areas of coaching where I needed more knowledge: management, leadership. It is different from leadership on the field as you are leading an organisation when you manage a club. You are hardened by the experience.

‘I think I am a coach who has empathy with his players but I’m less worried whether they are upset and disappointed, as I’ve seen the impact of relegation on a club — having to make staff redundant and make decisions that affected the livelihood of good friends. That toughens you up quite a bit.’

At first, it was difficult to adjust. He confesses to ‘getting under my wife’s feet’ and trying to find solace at his local gym, where he found himself becoming a regular at coffee mornings with the local pensioners.

He expressed an interest in some jobs in the Championship, only for no interviews to be forthcoming.

It was then Southgate realised the only way he would get back into the game was with education. Soon enough, doors started to open.

Southgate admits it was difficult to adjust but is glad he managed to get back on his feet with England's U21s

‘I worked with ITV, which got me access to some great matches and back involved studying football,’ said Southgate. ‘Then I got the call from Sir Trevor Brooking to come and work here, three-and-a-half years ago, which gave me a real insight into youth development in this country.

‘I think he knew I want the best for English football and wanted to maintain the standards that he had.

‘I see a lot of my mates out of work or losing their jobs and it’s a reminder that if you are doing something you believe in and it’s something that you really enjoy, that is a lucky place to be.’

He is 13 months into a three-year contract as Under 21 head coach and it is clear Southgate has had an influence. The way England came back in Wolverhampton against Croatia on Friday night was proof his methods are working.

England’s novices kept playing and pressing, never panicking. They approached the task in the same calm way as the man who has taken them to the brink of Euro 2015. It is why he will offer perspective if they ultimately fall short.

‘I’d just like the players and staff to progress,’ he said. ‘I think when you have been through what I have as an individual, first of all in 1996, then again with losing the job at Middlesbrough — having had to manage in the Premier League with no experience at 35 — you can cope with anything.
