Caught: Anthony Dean Blackwell was on the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's Top Ten Most Wanted list for less than 24 hours before he was arrested in Huntsville, Alabama on charges of raping a child

The most recent addition to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's Top Ten Most Wanted list was captured Friday in Huntsville, Alabama. 

Anthony Dean Blackwell, 24, was added to the list on charges of raping a 4-month-old infant placed in his care.

After receiving an anonymous tip, police arrested Blackwell at the Voodoo Lounge on Southside Square.

Blackwell initially tried to evade officers by running away, but was soon apprehended without incident in Big Spring Park in downtown Huntsville.

Blackwell was on the most wanted list for less than 24 hours before police located him.

He was wanted on charges of raping a child after babysitting a 4-month-old baby on July 9 in Pulaski, Tennessee.

Upon returning home, the infant's mother noticed signs of trauma which were later determined to be suffered from sexual abuse.

Because of the injuries, the child had to undergo surgery at the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital. 

Blackwell is currently being held without bond at the Madison County Jail. 

His criminal history includes charges of
public intoxication, driving under the influence, reckless driving, 
evading arrest, traffic and noise violation and vandalism, according to 
authorities.
