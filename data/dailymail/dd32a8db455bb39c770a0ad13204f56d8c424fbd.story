The wildfires spreading through southern California have left a victim with head-to-toe burns, injured four firefighters and forced 1,500 residents to flee from their Riverside County homes today.

As 40mph winds fanned the flames, Cal Fire described the blaze as 'burning uncontrolled'. It has already destroyed 15 homes and burned 10,000 acres west of Palm Springs.

The unnamed victim with full body burns was taken to a specialist burns center. Cal Fire Riverside Chief John Hawkins told NBC the person 'tragically was very badly burned'. A firefighter is also being treated for smoke inhalation.Scroll down for video:

As the wildfires burned across California, a child was killed and a woman believed to the mother was missing after heavy thunderstorms hit south-central Missouri yesterday.

The region has already seen rainfall 
saturate the land, so when heavy thunderstorms hit early yesterday, the 
already saturated areas flooded.

In California, evacuation orders have been put in place in several areas since the blaze, known as Silver Fire, began yesterday afternoon. Three national forests have also been affected by wildfires, according to Cal Fire.

Some residents and sheriff's deputies were trapped for a brief period of time, and were forced to take shelter, as the fire cut off escape routes, according to the Los Angeles Times.

At least 1,000 firefighters are trying to tackle the blaze, which started at 2pm yesterday. The wildfires were so intense that ash was reported to be falling 25 miles away in Palm Springs, according to NBC News.

'The smoke is so thick here in Palm Springs, the ashes are coming down like snow, and the air quality is really bad,' Michelle Renee Robinson-Scruggs wrote on NBC LAâ€™s Facebook page.

The fire near Banning, which has 
devoured nine square miles, injured two firefighters yesterday who both 
needed hospital treatment.

Lucas Spelman, 
spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,
said about a dozen buildings were damaged or destroyed, but could not 
say how many were homes.

Footage from TV news helicopters and photos from the scene showed several houses in flames.

They
include the Twin Pines home of Dave Clark, who was pictured talking on 
his cellphone with the home fully engulfed in flames behind him.

Devastation: Many buildings in the Poppet Flats area, pictured, were destroyed yesterday by the ravaging wildfire, about 90 miles east of Los Angeles. The blaze, known as Silver Fire, roared through the area along Highway 243 between Banning and Idyllwild, California

The fire broke out shortly after 2pm near a back-country road south of Banning, about 90miles (145km) outside Los Angeles in Riverside County, and within hours had blackened more than 5,000 acres, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Daniel Berlandt said

A number of homes in the Twin Pines Road area, pictured, were completely destroyed by the out-of-control blaze. Around 1,500 residents were evacuated yesterday as the wildfire raged across the land

'He said he lost everything, he couldn't talk,' brother Jeff Clark told the the Riverside Press-Enterprise.

Mr Clark's parents were killed in a house fire, in Riverside, in April 2012, the Press-Enterprise reported.

About 800 people evacuated the Silent Valley Club, a private RV resort, state fire spokesman Mr Spelman said.

About 700 more were under evacuation order in the rural communities of Poppet Flats, Twin Pines, Edna Valley and Vista Grande, and evacuation centers were set up at high schools in Hemet and Banning.

Smouldering: Last night, the extent of the devastation left behind in the wildfire's wake could be seen smouldering, vast swathes of the mountainside lit up by the still-burning embers

The communities are in the San Jacinto Mountains along Interstate 10 some 80 miles east of Los Angeles.

Margaret Runnels of Poppet Flats was at work when her house came under an evacuation order. She was in Banning waiting for her husband to collect pets and valuables from their house.

'I was hoping they would let me back up to get some personal items I knew my husband would forget like a jewelry box and stuff that means stuff,' a crying Mrs Runnels told the Desert Sun.

'You always tell yourself to prepare everything but you never take the stupid time to do it.'

More than 500 firefighters, helped by five helicopters and five air tankers, were working to protect homes and get ahead of the flames.

People were evacuated from three communities in the arid San Jacinto Mountains - a total of 1,500 residents fled their homes

All but three helicopters were grounded after night fall but were set to return to the air this morning.

Across the country in mid Missouri, another natural disaster has wreaked havoc for many families.

The Missouri Department of Transportation closed Interstate 44 south of Rolla along the Gasconade River, and U.S. 63 in Maries County after about six inches of rain fell in the area.

Traffic was being rerouted several miles around the flooded sections of the highways, said Sgt. Dan Crain, spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol in Rolla.

The National Weather Service said the Gasconade River at Rich Fountain was about four feet below flood stage, the point at which water is high enough to cause flooding, early yesterday.

Across the country: In Newburg, Missouri, residents faced a different natural disaster - flood water from Little Piney Creek, which burst its banks after torrential stormy weather yesterday

Interstate 44 near Jerome, Missouri, was closed by the rising waters, where the confluence of the Gasconade River and Little Piney Creek met. Gov. Jay Nixon has ordered the Missouri National Guard to help with flooding in south-central Missouri

No go: Missouri Department of Transport and State trooper workers guarded and assessed the flooded main road, and advised all drivers not to attempt to cross flooded roads

It was expected to reach its 20-foot flood stage later in the day and rise to near 32 feet early this morning, depending on how much more rain hits the area.

'It's a real mess,' Sgt Crain said. 'We're encouraging folks to be really careful. When there's water over the roads, don't take the chance. Don't take the risk. Please turn around.'

Hurricane Henriette is expected to weaken as it moves across the Pacific, far from land.

The hurricane's maximum sustained winds late Wednesday remained near 85mph (140 kph). The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami says additional weakening is forecast by Thursday as Henriette moves over cooler waters.

Henriette is centered about 1,235 miles (1987 kilometers) east of Hilo, Hawaii, and is moving west-northwest near 10 mph (17 kph).

Governor Jay Nixon also ordered the deployment of 50 military policemen of the Missouri National Guard to help local authorities dealing with flooding. Nixon declared a state of emergency Tuesday after heavy rains caused flash flooding and at least one confirmed death in the Waynesville area.

A four-year-old boy was killed and several homes and businesses damaged after heavy rain drenched the south-central town of Waynesville on Monday night and Tuesday morning.

The search for a missing woman who is believed to be the child's mother also resumed yesterday.

About a dozen homes were evacuated early Wednesday in Newburg, a Phelps County town of about 450 residents near the Little Piney River.

Laura Johnson, supervisor with the Phelps County Sheriff's Department, said a 12ft section of a county road washed away Wednesday morning. No injuries were reported.

'We have a lot of roads shut down now,' Johnson said. The rain had stopped yesterday morning in several areas, including Newburg, and water had begun receding in some flooded sections, she said.

The weather service also issued flood warnings yesterday for several southwestern Missouri counties, including Laclede and Wright counties, where several low-water crossings were also flooding after about two inches of rain fell in that region by early morning yesterday.
