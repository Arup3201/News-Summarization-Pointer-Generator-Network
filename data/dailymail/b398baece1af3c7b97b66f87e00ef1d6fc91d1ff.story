A drink-driver crashed into a parked car – because he bent down to pick up his kebab when it fell off the dashboard, a court heard.

Labourer Colin Watson, 27, who had drunk six pints before getting behind the wheel, leaned down to retrieve the snack which had dropped into the car footwell when he smashed into a parked car, in Harraby, Carlisle.

At Carlisle Magistrates’ Court, Watson, who was more than three times the legal drink-drive limit, after the collision, admitted driving while drunk.

Geoff Clapp, defending, said: ‘He realised he had had too much to drink to drive home and was turning back when, unfortunately, the kebab – which was on the dashboard – fell on the floor.

‘Mr Watson leaned down to get it and barged into the other car.’

A breath test found he had 112mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath – the legal limit is 35mcg.

Prosecutor Paul Gibson said Watson,  from Brampton, Carlisle, had gone for a drive on May 18, to ‘clear his head’ after an argument with his parents.

He stopped off at the Border Rambler pub, in Botchergate, and ended up drinking six pints before offering to drive a friend home.

The pair had stopped for a kebab in Harraby and Watson, then realised he was too drunk to drive.

As he was turning around to return to the city centre to get a taxi, he crashed into another vehicle.

Mr Gibson said: ‘A woman was in her car, which was stationary, talking to a friend she had dropped off.

‘All of a sudden she heard a loud bang and the car jolted forward.’

The driver got out and began apologising, but the woman told police he appeared drunk and was slurring his words.

She was uninjured, but the rear tyre arch was dented and the tyre was flat.

In mitigation, Mr Clapp said: ‘He is 27, single, without work and lives with his parents.’

Sentencing him, District Judge Gerald Chalk took into account that Watson, who had previously worked for Network Rail,  was about to start a new job in Scotland which would see him only returning to Carlisle on weekends.

He disqualified him from driving for 27 months and made him the subject of a 12-month community order.  

As part of this, he must complete 100 hours’ unpaid work.
