Dick Advocaat has a warning for Sunderland’s under-performing players – ‘If you don’t put it in for me I’ll be on the pitch letting you know’.

The Dutch boss watched in horror from his home in Holland last week as the Black Cats slumped to a 4-0 defeat against Aston Villa at the Stadium of Light, a result which cost Gus Poyet his job.

Advocaat has revealed he was waiting for Poyet to be sacked before taking over – he was sounded out three weeks ago - and says he will not tolerate performances such as last weekend's sorry surrender.

Dick Advocaat has never been relegated in his career and does not want Sunderland to be the first

‘I was very disappointed (watching the game). When they scored, you could see that something is going wrong in the players’ heads,’ he said ahead of his first match in charge at West Ham.

‘When Aston Villa scored their fourth goal, five players were standing still. When they lost the ball up front, the ball went, and five players were walking back instead of running back.

‘This is not possible. I told them, “If I was beside the line, I would have been on the pitch”. That means that something is wrong.’

Advocaat said he was disappointed with the Sunderland player's reaction after they conceded 

Sunderland are one place and one point above the relegation zone 

Advocaat has never been relegated during a 28-year managerial career – and he doesn’t intend to make that a first on Wearside.

‘I have never been relegated and I always have the feeling that I will never go down,’ he said.

‘So I don’t really want to talk about that. I have been close, but that was when I was a very young manager. I started at SVV when I was 36 and we were champions in one of the lower leagues. We had a difficult season the following year, but we survived in the last game.’

Advocaat has just nine games to save Sunderland from the drop and is confident his influence can make a difference.

‘It is always better if you start at the beginning of a season because then you can put all of your ideas in,’ he said.

‘But in terms of organisation, it is not that difficult to bring the players into step, so that everybody knows what to do. They have to do that.

‘If we are to going to win games, they have to do that. The organisation is the most important thing in football, then you can add in the individual skills of the players.’

For if they don’t step into line, Advocaat will be on the pitch letting them know.
