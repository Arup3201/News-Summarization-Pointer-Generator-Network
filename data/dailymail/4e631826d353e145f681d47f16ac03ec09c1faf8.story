A serial burglar killed a 'defenceless' elderly widow - just 12 days after a court let him back out on the streets.

Peter Harris, 33, who was on bail following a stint in prison for burglary, barged into the home of Elsie Mowbray, 87, on New Year’s Day after pretending he was looking for a rabbit in her garden.

But the stealing spree was interrupted when Mrs Mowbray’s son Richard turned up with her daily newspaper at her home in York.

Shameless: Drug addict Peter Harris, 33, burgled widow Elsie Mowbray, 87, less than a fortnight after a court freed him on bail

As he tried to flee Harris pushed Mrs Mowbray over with such force that she hit her head on the wall causing an indentation in the plaster.

Brave Mr Mowbray tried to stop Harris from escaping on a bicycle by shoving a stick in the wheel spokes -  but he managed to get away – and went on to rob £40 from a baby girl.

Mrs Mowbray was taken to hospital but discharged the same day because she didn’t display any symptoms of injury.

Leeds Crown Court heard how Harris, who was drunk and high on cocaine, fled to the flat of an acquaintance and begged for money.

When he was refused, Harris barged in and stole £40 from a baby girl’s money box, a watch, and even more cash from a wallet.

Later that day police raided Harris’s home in York where they found him hiding under the bed and wearing the stolen watch.

The next day Mrs Mowbray, whose husband died in 1991, was found slumped on the kitchen floor by her son – having apparently lain there all night.

She was rushed to hospital with internal head bleeding but tragically died six days later.

Harris was jailed for 12 years after he admitted manslaughter, burglary and robbery after committing what the judge described as a ‘brutal, violent and ugly nightmare’ for the elderly lady.

In a statement Mrs Mowbray’s family said: ‘The crime committed by Peter Harris caused the death of a gentle old lady and nothing can bring her back, but we hope today’s proceedings can draw a line and our family can start to look ahead to the future and find some peace.’

'Defenceless': Widow Elsie Mowbray, 87, was killed in her own home by drug addict Peter Harris, 33, after he forced his way in looking for things to steal

The court heard how Harris, who had been jailed previously for burglary, was granted bail for an undisclosed offence - just 15 days before the twin raids – when he began cruising the streets in a drink and drug fuelled haze looking for homes to loot.

He claimed his crimes were driven by his ‘long term deep addiction to drugs and alcohol’ and blamed his troubles on a ‘difficult upbringing’.

Passing sentence, Judge Keith Lindblom said: ‘Mrs Mowbray’s family had hoped her death when it came would be peaceful, not the brutal, violent ugly nightmare it turned out to be. If you had not chosen to burgle her home you would not have been there. If you had not been there and tried to escape she would not have sustained a serious injury to her head which proved to be fatal.’

After the case Det Supt Heather Pearson, Head of North Yorkshire Police’s Protecting Vulnerable Persons Unit, said: ‘Peter Harris knew his victim was an elderly, defenceless woman when she answered the door to him.

‘He showed no regard for her when he entered her property and has subsequently shown no remorse.

‘As a result of his actions, an otherwise fit and healthy lady has had her life cut short and a family has lost a loved one in tragic circumstances. Throughout the ordeal, subsequent criminal investigation and court processes, Elsie’s family have shown great dignity and composure.

‘I would like to thank the witnesses who supported the police investigation and the criminal investigation team for their hard work and dedication in gathering the evidence that has led to today’s conviction.’
