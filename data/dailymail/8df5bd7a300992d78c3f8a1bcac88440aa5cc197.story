Members and alumni of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Wesleyan University have filed a discrimination lawsuit against the Connecticut school over a recent decision that requires all residential fraternities to become coed within three years.

Wesleyan announced the policy in September after several highly publicized issues at fraternity houses, including allegations of sexual assault.

Delta Kappa Epsilon said in a statement Thursday that it is seeking a temporary injunction in Superior Court after learning that students would not be given the option of housing at on-campus single-sex fraternities during the 2015-16 school year.

Wesleyan requires that all undergraduates live on campus.

A spokesman for the fraternity's alumni chapter calls the school's decision 'political correctness gone wrong.'

The frat points out that Wesleyan has a number of other housing options that let students live together based on 'shared hobbies, experiences, cultural interests and identities.' 

The lawsuit cites several examples of undergraduate Program Houses that Wesleyan sponsors on campus, including the Light House, for Christian students, and the Women of Color House.

Wesleyan's refusal 'to permit male fraternity brothers to reside in single-sex housing' is contradictory to their 'willingness to allow many other diverse groups to reside by choice with members of the same sex, ethnicity, national origin, religion, culture, sexual orientation, sexual identification and the like,' the fraternity's press release stated. 

Delta Kappa Epsilon began working toward the school’s demand to go co-ed last year and developed a plan that would allow a female organization, such as a sorority, to offer residency within the fraternity’s house. 

Coed: The lawsuit comes after the frat was told by the school that its members couldn't live at their frat house for the 2015-2016 academic year, according to a press release from Delta Kappa Epsilon's Wesleyan chapter

Bathrooms and sleeping areas would be separate from the female organization’s, and common areas would be shared, according to the plan described in the suit.

In January, the university demanded that the fraternity begin providing a minimum of three residential rooms for women and details of an agreement to partner with a female residency organization by February 6, 2015, according to the suit, which seeks an injunction to block the housing ban. 

While the fraternity said it agreed to provide bedrooms for women, it hadn’t yet received a firm commitment from a partner female organization to share its building within three years.

The lawsuit comes in the midst of a huge debate over Greek life, student behavior and sexual assaults on campus, with everyone from President Obama to congressional leaders to student activists

A Wesleyan spokeswoman says the school will have a statement later this week.
