Women who love to keep fit but work in a smart environment often face the dilemma of lugging their gym kit around the office.

A scruffy sports bag slung over the shoulder on top of their handbag can detract from an otherwise elegant ensemble.

One British woman with this exact issue came up with a solution, and partnered up with a bag designer to launch her range of so-called GymTotes.

The Sophia bag, £120, is the latest style designed especially for yoga bunnies

Gym junkie Helena Searcaigh, alongside Nicola Kearney, came up with the idea for the chic faux leather handbags-come gym bags.

They resemble large, sophisticated totes but have secret compartments for gym clothes, trainers - and even a yoga mat.

Discreet zips near the bottom of the multi-purpose handbags reveal waterproof, breathable pockets for gym kit - whether freshly washed or drenched in sweat.

Built-in water bottle holders and roomy top areas for handbag essentials complete the designs.

The brand new Sophia contains a built-in yoga mat sleeve on the bottom

The original Reese style released last year, and now founder Helena launches her latest style, Sophia, designed especially for yoga bunnies. 

It contains a built-in yoga mat sleeve on the bottom and you can also comfortably store A4 documents in an inside pocket. 

Sophia is available from February 1 in tan and black, for £120. It's the third style in GymTote's range, which also includes Eva and Reese styles, all available from gymtote.co.uk, from £115.

Another company, Betabrand, specialise in versatile clothing designed to function for multiple purposes.

Last year they launched a pair of fancy yoga pants that double up as smart work trousers, called Dress Pant Yoga Pants.

The San Francisco firm, who ship internationally, also brought out a bike-to-workwear range of clothing.

It includes shirts, jackets, trousers and scarves include woven reflective elements to help illuminate the cyclist on the road. 

The plaid shirt from the range features reflective panels are discreet during the day but shine brightly during a night-time cycle.
