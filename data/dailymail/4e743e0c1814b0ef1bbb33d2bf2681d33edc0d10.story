Ed Woodward insists Manchester United are ready and willing to break the British transfer record if new manager Louis van Gaal decides they need to do so.

Woodward endured a frustrating first summer as United's executive vice-chairman last year, as mooted transfers for Cesc Fabregas, Thiago Alcantara, Gareth Bale and even Cristiano Ronaldo failed to materialise.

United have paid upwards of £50million for Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, but as has been the case for the last few years, the biggest transfers have taken place away from Old Trafford this summer.

Big money: Woodward says United would be willing to break the British transfer record of £50million which Chelsea spent to bring Fernando Torres to the club from Liverpool

Real Madrid signed James Rodriguez for £63million on Tuesday and Barcelona paid £75m for Luis Suarez earlier this month.

When asked whether United would be willing to pay a similar amount for a player, Woodward said: 'It is in our capabilities. The club are not afraid of doing that - spending significant amounts of money in the transfer market.'

Such a move would cause United to break the £50m record transfer fee paid by Chelsea for Fernando Torres in 2011.

Woodward insists neither he nor the club would be fazed about being responsible for such a big deal.

'Whether it's a record or not doesn't really resonate with us,' Woodward said.

'What resonates is a top, top elite player that the manager wants that is going to be a star for Manchester United.

'We are in a very strong financial position. We can make big signings.

'I get pointed in the direction of a target that the manager wants and there is an assessment of what that might cost and I'll negotiate hard to do the best I can on the trade.'

United are believed to be interested in signing Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund, as well as Van Gaal's compatriots Daley Blind, Stefan de Vrij and Kevin Strootman. 

Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen is also on Van Gaal's wish list but is understood that Juventus' Arturo Vidal is not being considered as a potential signing.

As well as experiencing troubles in the transfer market, Woodward also took the difficult decision to sack David Moyes, who was just 10 months into a six-year contract.

Woodward admits it was the toughest call of his career.

'I can't think of any bigger (decision),' he said. 'It is certainly the most important role in the club by some distance and we didn't take the decision lightly. It was a difficult decision. 

'It was a challenging year. In an ideal situation, I would have worked with (Sir) Alex (Ferguson) for a year. But now there is a lot more positivity.'
