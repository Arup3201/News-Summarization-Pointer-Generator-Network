Backlash: David Cameron was criticised over the weekend for only releasing a partial list of guests at his country retreat

The public are ‘right to be suspicious’ about David Cameron’s refusal to name all of his guests at Chequers, the former sleaze watchdog said.

Sir Alistair Graham said the Prime Minister risks ‘damaging public trust’ unless he reveals the full list of those wined and dined at his grace and favour country retreat.

Mr Cameron faced a backlash at the weekend after releasing a partial list of Chequers guests, which does not include those whose hospitality was paid for by the Conservative Party.

Critics said the decision meant the public could be kept in the dark about secret lobbying by businessmen, supporters and donors.

Tory sources tried to neutralise the row by revealing no significant donors had attended meals at Chequers since at least March 2012.

They pointed out that – unlike Ed Miliband – Mr Cameron has kept his pledge to list all dinners with party donors.

But Sir Alistair, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘If David Cameron is serious about transparency, as he says he is, then he should make available the names of all those coming to Chequers, apart from purely private family and friends.

‘The point about transparency is that we need to know who has access to the Prime Minister, regardless of who paid their dinner bill. Until we have got that the public are right to be suspicious.’

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman declined to say how many Chequers guests the Tory Party had paid for. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said there was a growing perception Mr Cameron was using Chequers to host ‘some sort of play-date for top Tory donors’.

But Tory sources accused Labour of ‘rank hypocrisy’, pointing out that Ed Miliband had failed to publish regular lists of meetings with union barons and other donors since pledging to in 2012.

Details released by Conservative Central Office reveal Mr Cameron has hosted no meals at his official residences for major donors since the ‘dinners for donors’ row in March 2012, when he was forced to admit seeing at least 15 donors – who had given the party £23million – in a series of secret lunches and dinners at Number 10 and Chequers.

However, Chancellor George Osborne held a dinner in his Downing Street flat in October 2012 for City tycoon Michael Spencer, a major Tory donor who called for the abolition of the 50p top tax rate.

The data also reveals Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and other ministers have attended several dinners with businessmen who give more than £50,000 a year to the Tories.
