Wales is currently discussing a 'strike' which would black out Wikipedia in protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act in America - a bill that critics allege would penalise sites such as Wikipedia where users are free to publish what they want

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has threatened a 'strike' where the entire English-language site would be turned off as a protest against  an anti-piracy bill currently under discussion in the U.S.

The site is used by an estimated 365 million readers worldwide, and is ranked sixth overall on earth.

Writing on his private Wikipedia blog, Wales said, 'A global strike of at least the English Wikipedia would put the maximum 
pressure on the US government.

'At the same time, it's of course a very 
very big deal to do something like this, it is unprecedented for English
 Wikipedia.'

The threatened 'strike' - which would black out Wikipedia in English and possibly other languages - is in response to the Stop Online Piracy Act, which is currently before the House Judiciary Committee.

Opponents of the bill - designed to protect copyright online - allege that it takes a 'guilty until proven innocent approach'.

Sites such as Wikipedia, where content can be published by any user, are alleged to be at risk.

The activist group Electronic Frontier Foundation said, 'At a minimum, this means that any service that hosts user generated content is going to be under enormous pressure to actively monitor and filter that content.'

'That’s a huge burden, and worse for services that are just getting started – the YouTubes of tomorrow that are generating jobs today.'

At present, Mr Wales's proposed 'strike' has been put up for discussion on the site. There are hundreds of comments from site insiders, most of which 'Firmly Support' the action.

'This bill is a threat to the internet, and must be stopped,' says one.

In Italy, Wikipedia took down almost the entire site in response to a law that would have made it a criminal offence to publish the results of police wire taps.

The site threatened to make the blackout permanent.

'A few months ago, the Italian Wikipedia community made a decision to blank all of Italian Wikipedia for a short period in order to protest a law which would infringe on their editorial independence,' wrote Wales.

'The Italian Parliament backed down immediately. As Wikipedians may or may not be aware, a much worse law going under the misleading title of Stop Online Piracy Act is working its way through Congress on a bit of a fast track.

'I thought this would be a good time to take a quick reading of the community feeling on this issue.'

'My own view is that a community strike was very powerful and successful in Italy and could be even more powerful in this case. There are obviously many questions about whether the strike should be geotargetted - U.S-only, etc.

'One possible view is that because the law would seriously impact the functioning of Wikipedia for everyone, a global strike of at least the English Wikipedia would put the maximum pressure on the US government.

'At the same time, it's of course a very very big deal to do something like this, it is unprecedented for English Wikipedia.'
