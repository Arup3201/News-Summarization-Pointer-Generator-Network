A 10-year-old girl was suspended from school today for breaking the rules… by dyeing her hair blue.

Fifth-grader Rachel Neely, from Bright, Indiana, put the blue Kool Aid streaks in her hair at a weekend sleepover friends.

According to the Sunman-Dearborn Intermediate School student handbook, unnatural hair colour is in breach of school rules but despite the best efforts of her father they were unable to get the dye out.

Shock: Rachel Neely was told she had been suspended after home remedies failed to remove the blue streaks from her hair.

Single dad Charles Neely said he got the shock of his life when Rachel came home from school with a note confirming she had been suspended.

It added that she wouldn't be allowed back into class until ever last bit of colour had been removed from her hair.

‘When she got home from school today the first thing she said was, 'Dad, I've been suspended because of my hair.' I was aghast,’ he told 9 News, adding that while he accepted the dress code he thought the punishment was a little extreme.

Extreme: The note said Rachel wouldn't be allowed back to school until all the blue was out of her hair.

‘Do I bite the bullet and take her to a 
salon and have her hair professionally coloured? Will she be 
re-suspended when that colour grows out and then half her hair is blonde
again?’

Tomorrow Charles will go to school with Rachel to ask principle Chris Vennemeier what can be done about his daughter’s hair. 

Rachel said she fears the ordeal may cause her to fail fifth grade, which would be a major blow for the bright student.

Aghast: Dad Charles told of his shock when his 10-year-old daughter came home from school with a suspension note.

‘It makes me kind of sad because they say I'm disrupting other children, that it's disrupting people,’ she said.

‘I really don't think that is reasonable.’ She added that her advice to other students would be to only ever dye their hair a natural colour.

Principle Vennemeier was unavailable for comment but denied that Rachel had been suspended when asked by 9 News.
