The new Archbishop of Canterbury warned David Cameron yesterday that there will be no retreat by the Church of England in its opposition to same-sex marriages.

Within minutes of his formal confirmation into the post, the Right Reverend Justin Welby reaffirmed his stand on the new laws to open up marriage to gay and lesbian people.

‘We have made our views clear and I’m very much with the House of Bishops on this,’ said Dr Welby, backing the Synod body which contains the Church’s bishops. He added: ‘The Government wants it. We think there are issues around the way it is going forward.’

The 105th Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby insisted he remained opposed to the government's plans for gay marriage as he took up his post in a ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral

Dr Welby’s message denies the Prime Minister any possibility of a compromise with the Church of England in advance of voting by MPs on the legislation today.

It came only three days after the CofE bluntly told MPs it does not trust the promises of the Government that churches will be shielded from the impact of gay marriage law.

The Archbishop tried to reassure Mr Cameron that he is not looking to open up his stewardship of the Church of England by picking a fight with the Government. ‘It is not a collision course. It’s just part of the normal discussion that one has,’ Dr Welby said.

‘I have no idea how the vote will go, so I am not going to get into hypothetical questions. I stand, as I have always stood over the last few months, with the statement I made at the announcement of my appointment, which is that I support the Church of England’s position on this.

‘We have made many statements about this and I stick with that.’

The Church made its final verdict on the laws clear at the weekend in a briefing paper drawn up for MPs, encouraging them to vote against the legislation.

It said Church leaders do not trust the Government’s promises that churches will be immune from legal retribution if they fail to conduct same-sex weddings.

MPs were told: ‘We retain serious doubts about whether the proffered legal protection for churches and faiths from discrimination claims would prove durable. Too much emphasis, we believe, is being placed on the personal assurances of ministers.’

The Church has said protections written into the law would be vulnerable to challenges. The Government claims a ‘quadruple lock’ will ensure churches are not forced to conduct gay marriages, but the CofE has warned a European court ruling could find against the safeguard.

The paper warned about ‘uncertain and unforeseen consequences for wider society and the common good when marriage is redefined in gender-neutral terms’.

The Church complained that the ‘reshaping and unnecessary politicising of a fundamental social institution’ was not advertised in election manifestos, did not appear in the Queen’s Speech, and has no mandate from the electorate.

Dr Welby, 57, spoke after a confirmation service at St Paul’s Cathedral marked the formal beginning of his job as Archbishop. The final step in the process will be his enthronement at Canterbury Cathedral next month.

The father of five said he looked forward to his new role ‘but also felt challenged and awed by it. It is an enormous privilege and my experience is to trust in the grace of God, not in your own abilities.’
