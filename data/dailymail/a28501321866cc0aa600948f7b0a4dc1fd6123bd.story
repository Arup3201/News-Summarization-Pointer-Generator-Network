A team of Swiss designers have developed a rocking chair that can transform energy from its rocking motion to charge an iPad or iPhone.

Built according to the classic, proven rocking chair design, the seat - which its makers have dubbed the iRock - uses a built-in generator that transforms gentle swaying into electricity.

Handcrafted from Swedish pine, it is styled with all the traditional features you would expect from a rocking chair but also comes equipped with an iPad stand.

Perfect for the older iFan: The owner's iPad rests conveniently on a stand built in to the chair's armrest

An updated classic: The iRock comes complete with stereo speakers built into the backrest

The backrest of the painted wood rocking chair also features built-in speakers, presumably to pelt out Radio 3 or Vera Lynn videos from YouTube.

Its makers claim that just an hour of easy swaying will charge your iPad to 35 per cent, and it is also compatible with other Apple devices - although publicity pictures suggest it uses the old-style connector.

The chair uses a winding mechanism combined with a set of gears to create enough force to drive the generator, which the development team says was a challenge to make energy efficient enough for practical use.

Now, however, they believe the same mechanism could be used to fit power generation mechanisms to doors, draws and stairs.

Obsolete already? Publicity pictures suggest the iRock ships with the old-style Apple connector - which means an adaptor would be needed for the latest generation of iDevices

The chair is still in development, but Micasa Lab, the Zurich-based design studio behind the chair, give it an estimated retail price of €1,300 (£1,038) - pretty steep for most pensioners.

Its makers say: 'The amount of technical gadgets we have learned to depend on has increased dramatically the last couple of years.

'The iRock is an product that explores how furniture can interact with technology and actually support the power for this technology.

'Movement is energy and to collect as much of this energy as possible is one of our future challenges.'
