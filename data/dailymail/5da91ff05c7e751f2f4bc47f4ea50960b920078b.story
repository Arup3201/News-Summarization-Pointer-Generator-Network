Detectives from Scotland Yard have used a helicopter in a fresh search for Madeleine McCann ahead of crucial excavation work in the holiday resort where she vanished.

After Scotland Yard detectives met with Portuguese authorities, an Alouette helicopter scoured the Praia da Luz coast on an apparent reconnaissance mission.

Military photographers, who were accompanied by British policemen, took pictures of the beach and key sites in the resort where detectives plan to dig for clues in the coming days.

Madeleine went missing as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant.

The preparatory work began amid ongoing tensions between British and Portuguese authorities over the cold case inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance seven years ago.

A team of Scotland Yard detectives flew in to the country on Wednesday and later met with their counterparts for four hours.

It is thought they have requested permission to question eight crucial witnesses after being given the green light to excavate key sites yards from where Madeleine was last seen on May 3, 2007.

They have already had requests rejected by the Policia Judiciaria, however, including plans to raid homes of some of the prime suspects in the case.

Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said yesterday: 'There are always going to be complications when you have got one police force in one country working with the police force of another.

Investigation:
 Local media reported that Scotland Yard has asked to speak with eight 
witnesses considered 'relevant' to the long-running case, in a letter 
sent to the Portuguese attorney general's office

Discussions: After almost two years of delicate negotiations, Scotland Yard has been given permission to start digging at sites surrounding the holiday resort in Praia da Luz where the youngster disappeared

Difficulties: The arrival of the team from Britain comes as tensions with the Portuguese authorities escalated

'We have both got to be sensitive to these things.

'The critical thing is, as Madeleine's parents have said and we all support, is that they need to have some closure on this, they need to know what happened to their daughter.'

A Portuguese Air Force helicopter was seen circling over Praia da Luz on Thursday afternoon.

During a 15-minute flyover, aerial photographs were taken over the beach and the areas surrounding the Ocean Club resort where Madeleine was holidaying with her twin siblings and their parents Gerry and Kate.

It is thought the reconnaissance exercise was commissioned by the Scotland Yard team on the ground, which is being led by detective chief inspector Andy Redwood.

They flew over key areas expected to be dug up for clues in the coming days, including a large wasteland just yards from the Ocean Club complex.

Search site: The waste ground in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where Scotland Yard officers will join local police officers in digging as part of the investigation

Abroad: Specialist search teams will start by scouring sites across Praia da Luz - including this waste ground near the Ocean Club apartment complex

The digs are not thought to necessarily be in connection with a search for the youngster's body or remains

This land that was not fenced at the time of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is contiguous to the path where witnesses saw a man passing with a child in pyjamas in her arms the night of the disappearance

Using radar equipment and mechanical diggers, officers will also search an area beside the beach and roads by the Our Lady of the Light church where Madeleine's parents prayed after she vanished.

While British detectives instigated the new searches and will cover the huge costs, it is thought they will not be able to take part in the excavation work.

Scotland Yard officers will, though, be on hand to supervise. Among the team are experts trained to detect bodies.

Operation Grange was set up in 2011 to investigate Madeleine's disappearance after David Cameron ordered Scotland Yard to review all the evidence in the case.

Madeleine was three years old when she vanished. She is due to turn 11 on Monday.

The Met Police said it was not prepared to provide a 'running commentary' on the inquiry.

Three former staff members at the Ocean Club are considered ‘people of interest’ by the inquiry.

Analysis
 of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her 
abduction and were in contact in the hours that followed.

One theory is that burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into snatching Maddie when she woke up.

Met detectives reportedly requested the men’s bank details and asked local officers to quiz the trio and search their homes.

But the judge who dealt with the requests ‘did not consider Scotland Yard’s arguments valid’, local sources said.

British detectives have since expressed their growing frustration at the length of time the probe is taking.

At
 the weekend Mr and Mrs McCann thanked the public for their 
unstinting support at a prayer service on the seventh anniversary of her
 disappearance.

The couple 
were joined by about 100 well-wishers, friends and relatives for a 
low-key open-air service in the centre of Rothley, Leicestershire.

It saw candles being lit for all children around the world who have been taken away from their parents against their will.

They
 also spoke of the family's gratitude that the Metropolitan Police 
investigation was now moving on to a ‘very active’ phase. Maddie was 
snatched while on a family holiday on May 3, 2007.
