It is hardly the place for anyone who values a room of one's own.

For while this Tokyo resident does have his own space - and at a bargain price - it measures a paltry five square metres.

Although he has evaded spiralling rents in the Japanese capital by finding a home for just ¥40,000 (£145, $242) a month, he has been left surrounded by his own detritus.

His humble abode even boasts a kitchenette - though he has to head outside to shower.

And the intrepid resident even has space to invite a friend over - just.

Cosy: The flat's occupant, who has not been named, can just about squeeze in space to sleep

Got company: Despite his lack of personal space, the man is still able to invite a friend over

Stacking up: The man, nonetheless, has managed to cram a huge number of possessions into the tiny space

What a mess: There is no space left to see the floor

Popping to the fridge: The apartment features and extremely cramped 'kitchenette'

Sinking feeling: The owner may struggle to make much use of his kitchen facilities

Clutter: Piles of boxes, as well as an aging computer screen, pack out one corner of the room

Boxing clever: The resident, who is not keen to get rid of any of his stash, has taken to building upwards

Toiletry shelf: The man has been forced to make good use of space to story all of his essentials, and non-essentials

Library: Carefully piled up, the man's extensive collection of sometimes-risqué literature is still accessible

But has nowhere to put his mountains of rubbish, piled all around the room
