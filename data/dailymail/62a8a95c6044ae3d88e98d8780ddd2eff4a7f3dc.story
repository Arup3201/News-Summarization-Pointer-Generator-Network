Philippe Coutinho's Brazil call-up is fully deserved following his performances for Liverpool last season, according to national icon Zico.

The 22-year-old has just one cap for his national side so far, coming nearly four years ago, but he has been recalled to the side after their re-appointed coach Dunga swung the axe following their World Cup disaster.

Just ten players from Luiz Felipe Scolari's tournament squad have been included, with a host of names such as Julio Cesar, Dani Alves, Paulinho and Hulk having been left out.

No surprise: Philippe Coutinho has been recalled to the Brazil national team by new coach Dunga

Well-deserved: And Brazil legend Zico believes that Coutinho fully deserves the recall 

And Zico believes Coutinho is ready to make his name in the famous golden yellow shirt. 

'Coutinho is a very skilled and tactical player,' Zico told Liverpool's official club website.

'He has already played in a number of countries, which must have been a good learning experience for him as he has achieved a higher level of confidence now at Liverpool.

'This confidence has probably come from the manager and his team-mates, and is something our players need when playing abroad.

'He's improved his performances as a result and you can see [last season] he was being more audacious in trying new moves and taking higher risks.'

'For me, that development was important for Liverpool to have the attacking quality we saw last season.'

Impressive: The midfielder has been an excellent addition to Liverpool's squad in the last 18 months
