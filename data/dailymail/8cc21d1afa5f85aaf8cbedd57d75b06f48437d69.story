Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said police and prosecutors will apply more rigorous tests, after a string of celebrities who faced historic allegations have been cleared

Historic sex abuse allegations will be subject to stricter tests before prosecutions, the country's most senior police officer has said.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said police and prosecutors will apply more rigorous tests after a string of celebrities who faced historic allegations have been cleared.

But he said police were duty bound to investigate such allegations in the wake of the scandal caused by disgraced BBC presenter Jimmy Savile.

Recent acquittals of celebrities accused of sex crimes include the verdicts in the cases of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell.

Last week Conservative MP Nigel Evans was also found not guilty of sex abuse allegations, sparking fierce criticism of the Crown Prosecution Service.

Speaking to LBC radio station about how officers would approach cases in the future, he said: 'There is no doubt that both the Crown Prosecution Service and ourselves are going to make a probably more rigorous test of the evidence, given that its such a long time ago.

'I’m sure it’s something that all of us will look at in terms of these historic cases.

He added: 'I think we’re trapped in a bit of a fix here. This country does not have, as some countries have, a bar on historic investigations or convictions.'

Sir Bernard said that evidence was already reviewed very seriously.

A police whistleblower who resigned after raising concerns about the massaging of crime statistics also confronted the Metropolitan Police Commissioner during the radio phone in.

Pc James Patrick asked Sir Bernard during the appearance on LBC whether the force will change the way it deals with whistleblowers after his experience.

He told Britain's most senior police officer: 'I feel very, very let down in particular by the senior levels of the Met and I wanted to take the opportunity to say that.

'I sincerely hope that people who want to expose wrongdoing in the Met get a slightly less raw deal in the future.' 

Speaking to LBC radio station's Nick Ferrari about how officers would approach cases in the future, he said: 'There is no doubt that both the Crown Prosecution Service and ourselves are going to make a probably more rigorous test of the evidence, given that its such a long time ago'

Sir Bernard said he would be willing to meet Mr Patrick now that there are no disciplinary proceedings ongoing, and that the force is always willing to look at how it deals with officers who raise concerns.

When asked whether Scotland Yard will review procedures, he said: 'We are always prepared to do that. In each case, as you will know sadly in your experience, it's not straightforward.

'Of course we will always be prepared to look at that and if there's anything that comes from it of course we will try and learn. It's a difficult balance to strike.'

Mr Patrick gave evidence to an influential committee of MPs claiming that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had become 'an engrained part of policing culture'.

He was separately put under internal investigation by the Met after writing about changes to the police service in a blog, on Twitter and later in a book, The Rest Is Silence.

Scotland Yard later downgraded his disciplinary proceedings from gross misconduct to misconduct, meaning he would not have faced the sack.

But he then decided to resign, blaming his treatment by the Metropolitan Police in the wake of 'making disclosures in good faith and in the public interest'.

Today he told Sir Bernard that there was 'an awful lot' that the force could learn from his case.

The commissioner told him: 'I'm sorry about your experience, I'm sure whatever the rights and wrongs it's not something that you have enjoyed, or your family.

'I hope you would be prepared to accept as well although you've got a very firm view about of what you have seen and your experience, I have asked for independent advice to find out whether your allegations are endemic or in fact your experience was a one off.'

Mr Patrick's claims about crime statistics, combined with further evidence submitted to Parliament, ultimately led to the UK Statistics Authority stripping police-recorded crime figures of their gold-standard status.

NF: And lastly, Fiona in Clapham, ‘With the collapse of the case against Nigel Evans, is too much money and time being spent on these alleged past offences?’

BH: I think we’re trapped in a bit of a fix here. I think this country doesn’t have, as some countries have, a bar on historical investigations or convictions, just a time limit. 

NF: A lot of your men and women’s time and money taken up with this, isn’t there, Commissioner? 

BH: There is, but of course, whichever we do, we’re going to be wrong. We were accused historically of ignoring people who came forward in the Jimmy Savile case, for example, a man who is now dead. 

NF: And possibly Cyril Smith? 

BH: And possibly Cyril Smith, so we apparently ignored them at the time. If they come forward now and they say, “Now you’re ignoring me again,” what are we to do? Are we to ignore them twice? I don’t think that’s going to happen.

So I think we’ve got to investigate. I think there’s no doubt that both the Crown Prosecution Service and ourselves are going to make probably a more rigorous test of the evidence given it’s such a long time ago. 

NF: And that’s needed now, isn’t it? 

BH: Well, I’m sure that it’s something that all of us will look at in terms of these historical cases but I already know that these cases are reviewed very seriously before they are charge contemplated. 

NF: Alright. 

BH: What you can never do, none of us can do, is predict the outcome of a jury.
