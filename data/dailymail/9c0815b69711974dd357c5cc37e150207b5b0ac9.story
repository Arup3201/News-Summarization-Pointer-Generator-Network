Desperate retailers are cutting prices and supermarkets are trading around the clock as shoppers prepare to spend almost £3billion on the final Saturday before Christmas.

Major chains have made a raft of reductions after festive takings at the till fell below expectations.

More than 700 supermarkets are opening 24 hours a day – except Sunday – to feed a last-minute dash for food and gifts.

At the same time, many other stores and shopping malls are staying open until 10pm and beyond.

Industry figures suggest that shoppers have been delaying their buying until the last minute in a bid to force retailers to offer better deals.

The dam is expected to burst today, the busiest shopping day of the year, with predictions of 15million consumers taking to the streets.

Marks & Spencer is hosting a ‘Magic and Sparkle Spectacular’ with 30 per cent off most items – its first significant Christmas sale since 2008.

Earlier this week, Gap boosted its reductions from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, while Debenhams, House of Fraser and Laura Ashley have also been running ‘flash’ sales.

The big supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – are also under pressure to open for longer and deliver big savings after figures showed they are losing customers to budget rivals, such as Lidl and Aldi.

Sainsbury's is also gearing up 
for a big weekend with pallets of festive confectionery flying off the 
giant shelves of its Waltham Point Distribution Centre in Essex.

This
 weekend is predicted to be the busiest weekend of the year for the 
Sainsbury's warehouse.

In the seven days before Christmas the 700,000 sq
 ft centre, the equivalent to nine football pitches, will process three 
million cases of food along its four miles of conveyor belts, and fulfil
 1,200 deliveries a day.

Many retailers are slashing prices by more than 70 per cent in a last-ditch bid to tempt people through the tills.

One industry insider said: ‘The high street is a bit of a bloodbath. Everyone is on promotion.

‘Some
 retailers went on some sort of sale really early this year, which makes
 it very difficult for others to hold their full price position.

‘There
 is also the weird psychology of Christmas falling on a Wednesday, which
 means people are shopping later and think they have got more time.

‘Unless retailers really hold their nerve you end up with this intense promotional landscape.’

Andrew
 Hughes, analyst at investment bank UBS, said: ‘The clothing retailers 
look to have pressed the panic button this year as subdued real 
disposable income, weak footfall and warmer weather have held back full 
price sales.’

Research by accountants 
PricewaterhouseCoopers shows 72 per cent of high street stores are 
running sales or promotions such as three for two.

Footfall on Oxford Street is almost 10 per cent lower than in 2012 although it rose 7.4 per cent in the first half of this week compared with last week

Piles of presents: Goods are sorted in in the Sainsbury's Waltham Point Distribution Centre

Supermarket giant Tesco has revealed half of all its Christmas sales this year have been online.

Last week, 50 per cent of all the presents the store sold were bought online from Tesco Direct, and half were bought in store.

This represents a significant rise of online purchasing compared last year.

Online
 purchases represented 20 per cent of the total sales of present in 
Christmas 2012, so the trend towards more online shopping is clear.

Tesco says this is undoubtedly spurred on by increased use of mobile devices.

The average price discount is 46 per cent – a greater cut than the 44 per cent recorded at the same time last year.

Mark Hudson, retail consulting leader at PwC, said: ‘As we all get ready for that frantic last weekend of shopping before the big day … promotions are still a key weapon to drive footfall.

‘Expect to see further sale activity on the final two days as savvy last-minute shoppers hold out for pre-Christmas bargains.’

Tesco is opening more than 500 stores around the clock between now and Christmas Eve, except for Sunday, while Asda is trading 24 hours a day from more than 200 outlets.

Sainsbury’s is opening five branches around the clock and another 16 from just after midnight on Monday morning.

Some 176 M&S stores at BP Connect petrol stations and three airport stores will be open throughout the festive period, including Christmas Day, with most operating 24 hours a day.

Will Becker, of TotallyMoney.com, said: ‘January was always the time that people looked  for reductions, but this trend has shifted to December as struggling retailers are forced to drop prices in pre-Christmas sales as they try to entice consumers through the doors.’

Retail experts at Barclays expect more than 15million adults to go to the shops today, spending an average of £196 each – a total of £2.94billion.

Catherine McGrath, of Barclays retail bank, said: ‘Retailers are giving great offers and discounts and consumers are being savvier than ever to ensure they pick up a bargain.’
