Labour was challenged to hand back donations from the Unite union yesterday after its leader called for civil disobedience during the Olympics.

General secretary ‘Red Len’ McCluskey threatened illegal strikes and direct action to oppose changes to public sector pensions.

Labour leader Ed Miliband joined the Trades Union Congress in denouncing Mr McCluskey’s outburst – but only after he had tweeted a mild rebuke earlier in the day.

Mr Miliband also faced calls to break the link with the union which remains Labour’s biggest donor.

In the Commons, David Cameron said: 
‘Let us remember Unite is the single biggest donor to the party 
opposite, providing around a third of their money, and had more role 
than anybody else in putting the Right Honourable Gentleman (Mr 
Miliband) in his place.’

Mr Cameron also attacked Mr Miliband for initially failing to condemn Mr McCluskey’s views in person.

On Tuesday night when news of Mr 
McCluskey’s views first surfaced, the Labour leader left it to his 
spokesman to respond. Then yesterday morning he issued a tweet and sent 
his deputy Harriet Harman to answer questions on radio and television.

But Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s not good 
enough for them just to put out a tweet, they need to condemn this 
utterly and start turning back the money.’

Downing Street earlier denounced the threat of strikes to disrupt the Olympics as ‘completely unacceptable and unpatriotic’.

Rebuke: Nick Clegg said the public would be 'gobsmacked' and 'appalled' by Mr McCluskey's comments

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Mr Miliband to ‘rein in’ the union boss.

‘I just think people will be 
gobsmacked, appalled, that someone thinks that at a time when we are 
finally hosting one of the greatest events in the world, he is calling 
for civil disobedience,’ Mr Clegg said.

‘I know he is the sort of paymaster of the Labour party but I hope Ed Miliband will rein him in.’

Stung into action, the Labour leader eventually broke cover to speak out as he met French Socialist leader Francoise Hollande.

Mr Miliband said: ‘It’s completely 
wrong to make any threat to the Olympic Games – I do condemn it. We as 
the Labour government fought for the Olympic Games to be brought to 
Britain as part of a cross-party effort – it is a moment of national 
celebration.

‘The focus of the world will be on 
Britain and it is totally wrong to make a threat to the Games.’ Since 
the general election Unite has given £5million to Labour, making it by 
far the party’s biggest donor.

Mr McCluskey said no precise plans had
been drawn up for action during the games, but added that they 
‘absolutely’ could include strikes.

Pugh's take

‘The attacks that are being launched 
on public sector workers at the moment are so deep and ideological that 
the idea the world should arrive in London and have these wonderful 
Olympic Games as though everything is nice and rosy in the garden is 
unthinkable. Our very way of life is being attacked,’ he said.

Labour MPs were also furious last night with Mr McCluskey. ‘This is just posturing but it doesn’t do us any good,’ said one.

‘This sort of thing is unpopular with 
the public and damages by association. Ed needs to take a stand and show
that he’s not Unite’s man.’

TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: ‘The TUC and Britain’s unions have been strong supporters of the London Olympics.

Unions have engaged constructively 
with the Olympic authorities throughout the whole project to ensure the 
good working conditions that are helping deliver the Games on time and 
on budget.’
