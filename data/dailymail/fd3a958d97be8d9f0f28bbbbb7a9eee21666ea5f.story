Luis Suarez is stretching himself to the limit in a bid to be fit for Uruguay's opener against Costa Rica on Saturday.

The Liverpool striker had looked as if he'd miss the entire World Cup after compulsory keyhole surgery to his knee only last month.

But 'triple shifts' and a strict training regime could see Suarez play some part of their first game in Group D - despite meniscus damage in his left knee that flared up in training on May 21.

Race against time: Suarez hopes to be fully fit for Uruguay's opening game against Costa Rica on June 14

Even if he didn't make it this weekend, the 27-year-old is highly likely to face England on June 19.

Winger Christian Rodriquez revealed just why Suarez - who has a reputation of recovering from injuries extraordinarily quickly - is nearing a speedy return.

'He is very focused. He is working in double and triple shifts and we hope to have him with us soon,' Rodriquez said.

There appears to be little pressure from above for Suarez to race himself back to fitness, but the PFA Player of the Year is passing tests at an alarming rate.

He impressed in training on Tuesday, looking sharp as he went through fitness drills and a small amount of ball work.

Suarez's head coach Oscar Tabarez remains calm on the issue, but is aware what the ramifications of his star man missing out would be.

'As we have no set deadlines,' he said. 'I don't know if we'll have him for the first match, for the second, for the third.

'If it were up to me, Suarez would play tomorrow.'
