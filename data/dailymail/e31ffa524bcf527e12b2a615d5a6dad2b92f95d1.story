Scrabble purists watch out, the word is that someone wants to change the rules.

A U.S. academic and Scrabble fan has proposed altering the value of some letters to reflect changes in the dictionary and how easy they are to play with other letters.

Dr Joshua Lewis, who created a computer programme to recalculate the values, is likely to outrage purists by awarding just six points for a Z, which is the highest scoring tile alongside Q, with both worth ten points.

He says only Q should remain a ten-point tile, with X relegated from eight to five. The game was invented 1938 by Alfred Butts, who calculated the scores based on how frequently letters appeared on the front page of the New York Times.

Calls for change: A researcher claims that the letter values in Scrabble - which was invented 75 years ago - are outdated

Updated: Researcher Joshus Lewis has devised a new scoring system where letter values - such as Z and X - have been changed to better represent how frequently they are now used in the English Language

Mr Lewis gives the letter Z as a prime example, claiming that by today's standards it should only be worth six points instead of the traditional 10.

He also suggests that X - worth eight points in the current game - should only be worth five points.

But while many of the letters would decrease in value under the system devised by Mr Lewis, some letters would go up in value.

Mr Lewis recommends that the letter U increase from one point to two points and G go from two to three. Q, however, is still apparently a tricky word to play and should still count as 10 points, Mr Lewis adds.

Researcher Joshua Lewis has made a new scoring system so the value of letters better represent how often they are used in the modern day English language.

Here is what each letter is worth in his software programme called Valett:

A: 1 - Stays the same  B: 3 - Stays the same

C: 2 - Down from 3      D: 2 - Stays the same

E: 1 - Stays the same  F: 3 - Down from 4

G: 3 - Up from 2           H: 2 - Down from 4

I: 1 - Stays the same    J: 6 - Down from 8

K: 4 - Down from 5       L: 2 - Up from 1

M: 2 - Down from 3      N: 1 - Stays the same

O: 1 - Stays the same  P: 2 - Down from 3

Q: 10 - Stays the same R: 1 - Stays the same

S: 1 - Stays the same   T: 1 - Stays the same

U: 2 - Up from 1            V: 5 - Up from 4

W: 4 - Stays the same  X: 5 - Down from 8

Y: 3 - Down from 4        Z: 6 - Down from 10

Mr Lewis told the BBC: 'The dictionary of legal words in Scrabble has changed. Among the notable additions are all of these short words which make it easier to play Z, Q and X, so even though Q and Z are the highest value letters in Scrabble, they are now much easier to play.'

Mr Lewis has devised a new software programme called Valett which awards points using a scoring system based on how frequently letters are used in the English language today.

The new system takes into account the frequency of the letters in the English language, the frequency of how many times a letter appears in two, three, seven, and eight-letter words and how easy it is to play the letter with other letters.

But Mr Lewis is far from the first to devise a new scoring system for Scrabble, which was invented in 1938 by American architect Alfred Butts, who calculated letter scores by measuring how frequently they appeared on the front page of the New York Times.

The co-president of the North American Scrabble Players Association, John Chew, says he hears from people at least once or twice a year saying that the tile values are incorrect.

But he warns there would 'catastrophic outrage' around the world if the game rules were now changed.

He told the BBC: 'Some people would just continue playing with the old tile distributions because people who've played the game often enough tend to remember that the Q is worth 10 points, the Z is worth 10 points and so on.'

Mr Chew added that letters such as S and blank tiles, that while low scoring alone, are a great help in joining words and achieving multiple word scores in one go.

But while there may be many who would relish the chance to see an end to the 10 point Z, which can so often play the deciding tile in a closely-fought game of Scrabble, the makers of the game have no intentions of changing it.

Philip Nelkon, the UK representative for Scrabble makers Mattel, said: 'Mattel has no plans to change Scrabble tiles. It is not a game where fairness is paramount, it is a game of luck and changing the tile values wouldn't achieve anything.'

Mr Lewis admitted that his new way of scoring, while making the game fairer, may not suit everyone.

He said: 'That might be desirable in tournaments but it might not be as good in casual play where you want the less skilled players to have a shot periodically at beating the more highly skilled players.'
