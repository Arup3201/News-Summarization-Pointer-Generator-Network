Marc Muniesa wants to be a centre-half – on this evidence the former Barcelona starlet could find himself at centre-forward.

Stoke are yet to score at home in the Barclays Premier League this season but are unbeaten on the road and their Spanish left back was the unlikely hero, scoring twice to sink last season’s beaten finalists.

The 22-year-old is seen as understudy to Erik Pieters at Stoke but his two emphatic strikes at the Stadium of Light could have the likes of Peter Crouch and Mame Biram Diouf looking over their shoulders.

And Potters boss Mark Hughes said:  ‘He’s only ever scored four goals in his career. Given his pedigree, we know he is technically gifted and I can play him at centre half or left back. He’s probably got the ability to play in midfield.

‘Because of that ability he’s able to affect the game when he finds himself in different areas of the field, and that’s what he did.’

Muniesa — who made his Barca debut at 17 — had not scored since his days in the Segunda Division with their B team.

The Spanish under-21 international smashed a sumptuous response to Jozy Altidore’s 16th-miniute opener for Sunderland, holding off John O’Shea before driving through the legs of Costel Pantilimon. Both sides were lucky to finish the half with 11 men after Jack Rodwell’s late lunge triggered a throat-grabbing retaliation from Steven Nzonzi, a confrontation for which both were booked.

Will Buckley twice went close to restoring Sunderland’s advantage before Muniesa struck again after 72 minutes.

Pantilimon — who played against Sunderland for Manchester City in the Capital One Cup final in March — elected to punch clear but Muniesa won his tussle for possession with Adam Johnson before blasting past the keeper.

Poyet at least had Altidore’s first goal in 30 matches to celebrate and it was impressive in its execution. The American rolled Robert Huth on the fringe of the area before shooting into the bottom corner.

Poyet said: ‘It was important for him. It’s been difficult for him. He knows he needs to score to convince people.

‘I don’t think we played badly. Some decisions didn’t go our way, like the player grabbing (Rodwell) by the neck. The rules say that is a red card.’

Hughes, though, felt Stoke’s victory was well deserved, saying: ‘Yes, (goalkeeper) Jack Butland was excellent, but the best team won on the night.’
