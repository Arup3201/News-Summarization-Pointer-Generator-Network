An assistant nurse at UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, who tortured her adoptive children with a hammer in a spate of sickening attacks, has been sentenced to seven years to life in prison.

The court heard that Ingrid Brewer, 53, of Palmdale, California, became increasingly sadistic, binding the children's hands with zip-ties and viciously beating them with electrical cords and a hammer.

The seven-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy, who were found in the street in freezing temperatures after running away, testified that they were locked into separate bedrooms when Brewer went to work each day, were deprived of food and forced to use wastebaskets for a lavatory.

Twisted: Ingrid Brewer, 53 (left), was found guilty of two counts of torture after she subjected her two small, adopted children to a sequence of horrific attacks with electrical cables, pipes and a hammer. She also deprived them of food and locked them in their room at her Palmdale home (right) while she went to work

Brewer was initially a foster mother to the children, but she then adopted them. Her conviction has raised questions about the standards applied to vetting prospective adoptive parents in the state.

The LA Times reported that after Brewer’s arrest, it emerged that she had a history of child abuse investigations going back to 2001, when the county's child abuse hotline received a tip-off that she was abusing her biological children.

However, social workers decided to take no further action. 

At the time of the adoption, Brewer's file contained at least nine investigations of alleged abuse over the previous 12 years, according to the LA Times.

Both the boy and the girl were home-schooled by their reclusive adoptive mother in the middle-class suburb of Palmdale. Neighbours reported that Brewer was aloof and unfriendly, and one was not even aware that she had children.

It was only due to the bravery of the eight-year-old boy that the torture came to light.

‘The brother was the one that managed to get himself out of his bedroom,’ Sgt. Brian Hudson of Los Angeles County's Special Victims Bureau told MyFoxLA after the children escaped in January 2013.

‘He managed to get his sister out of her bedroom and told her, “It's time to go, we've got to get out of this house.”

The children, he said, who were 'tired of being tied up and beaten', escaped without their coats in freezing temperatures, and hid several blocks away.

When Brewer became aware of the disappearance she called the police, who launched a search of the area.

The children were found hours later, huddled under a blanket in the street in the bitter cold.

They told officers about the torture they were suffering, and Brewer - who told detectives that one of the reasons she was locking the children up was because they had been stealing food - was arrested.

Investigators said marks and injuries on the victims’ bodies were consistent with the abuse they described. The children were also apparently malnourished. 

In December, Brewer pleaded no contest to two counts of torture, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office.

Brewer has been sentenced to seven years to life. She will be eligible for parole after seven years but may spend the rest of her life in prison.
