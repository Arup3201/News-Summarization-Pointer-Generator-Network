Eric Masters, 28, has been accused of filming the rape of a toddler

A man has been accused of filming the rape of a toddler after tying her to a motel bed.

Eric Devin Masters was alleged to have taken the 18-month-old to the room where he tied her to a bed and taped himself abusing the child.

The 28-year-old has been charged with four counts of criminal sexual conduct in relation to the allegations at Motel 6 in June 2012, according to Michigan Live.

The alleged assault was discovered when FBI agents were investigating Masters for a series of sex crimes throughout the state.

An agent said one of the videos discovered on Master's computer showed the acts against the child by a man with the same tattoos found on Masters.

The graphic details of the assault were included in a probable cause affidavit filed in Kent County District Court.

Masters, from Grand Rapids, pleaded guilty at the town's U.S. District Court to multiple counts of sexual exploitation of a child and producing child pornography. 

The charges carry a sentence of between 15 years and life.

Masters also awaits sentencing after pleaded no contest to third-degree criminal-sexual conduct with a 13-year-old in Muskegon County Circuit Court.

Last year, Masters was sentenced to 36 days in jail and five years on probation after he pleaded no contest in Ionia County Circuit Court to second-degree criminal-sexual conduct, state police records showed.

Masters will be tried in Kent County before Circuit Court Judge Mark Trusock in between hearings in federal court and Muskegon County, where he has been held for more than a year on a $250,000 bond, according to court records.
