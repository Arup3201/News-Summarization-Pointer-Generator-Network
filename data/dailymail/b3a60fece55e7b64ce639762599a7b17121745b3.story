The young woman kept as a ‘slave’ all her life became obsessed with a neighbour, writing him scented love letters and sending him photographs of herself, it was claimed last night.

The 30-year-old allegedly held captive by a cult-like Left-wing commune along with two older women was seen as ‘spooky’ by neighbours but did have some limited contact with the outside world.

She is said to have sent hundreds of love letters to neighbour Marius Feneck who lived two floors above her at the block of flats in Brixton, South London.

In one of the heat-rending notes, in 
which she addresses him as her 'beloved sweetheart', she warns him not 
reply or talk to anybody about it because she feared he captors would do
 something 'evil' to him.

Mr Feneck told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘She 
used to send me pictures and write me letters about how she wanted to be
 with me. I wasn’t interested but she wouldn’t stop trying to get with 
me.’

'Love letters': Marius Feneck, pictured, who allegedly received scented letters and photographs from one of the women

He showed seven 
photographs of a slim, brunette woman with pale skin, wearing Western 
clothes, claiming she stuck them on his door to ‘tempt’ him.

Mr Feneck’s girlfriend, Rachael 
Price, 25, said the girl, who they knew as ‘Rose’ had been writing him love letters for seven 
years, posting them when she walked to the local Tesco supermarket with 
her alleged captors.

‘They
 were scented and she would walk slightly behind the old couple as they 
passed the building’s letterboxes on the ground floor, so she could slip
 them in our letter box.

‘In
 them she said she loved him and wanted to be with him for ever. There 
must have been about 500 letters sent to him over the years, some with 
lipstick kisses on them, and they were deeply obsessive.

'But she told 
him never to visit her because she lived with people who were racist.’

Miss Price said the alleged captive had recently written her a ‘vile letter’ falsely accusing her of attacking Mr Feneck.

‘She
 said I was disgusting, and my children didn’t deserve me. Rose had a 
weird dead-eyed look to her and I was scared of her. I was thinking of 
going to the police. If I had gone, she might have got away earlier.’

Neighbours said they often saw a young woman who lived at the property staring out of the window or accompanying an elderly couple to the shops

The case came to light after the Irish woman rang the Freedom Charity last month to say she had been held against her will.

The Malaysian woman is believed to have suffered a stroke but was being denied mdeical care.

Freedom Charity founder Aneeta Prem said: 'These women have had traumatic and distributing experiences, which they have revealed to us.

The first thing the youngest of the three women asked for after escaping the south London flat was make-up.

The 30-year-old was freed into the care of the Freedom Charity along with a 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman.

Freedom charity founder Aneeta Prem told the Sunday Times: 'It was the first thing that she asked me for and one of the things she was very, very keen on.

'She liked the way I did my make-up. I don't know if she had ever worn make-up. I ended up buying them all foundation, mascara, eye liners, powders lipsticks.

'They were absolutely thrilled and excited when I took the box of make-up out.'

'What needs to happen now is that the
 three victims, who have begun a long process of recovery, are able to 
go through their rehabilitation undisturbed, without being identified.'

Police were last night guarding the 
address where it is believed the three women – aged 69, 57 and 30 – were
 kept for some of the  30 years they spent in captivity.

Lambeth
 Council was under pressure last night to reveal how much it knew about 
the women, rescued last month from a housing association flat where they
 were living with two suspected illegal immigrants from Tanzania and 
India.

The suspect man and woman, both 67, 
were arrested on Thursday but released on bail after being questioned 
over false imprisonment and immigration offences.

Neighbours
 said they often saw a young woman who lived at the property staring out
 of the window or accompanying an elderly couple to the shops.

The 
woman, apparently born in Britain and called Rose, allegedly tried to 
become close to a man living in a nearby flat – and was jealous of his 
girlfriend.

The young woman and her alleged captors lived in a ground-floor flat in the housing association block, which is thought to have been built only a decade ago, along with the two older women. Police are looking for other properties the group previously lived in.

Questions: Lambeth Council was under pressure last night to reveal how much it knew about the women who were rescued last month

Police are conducting house-to-house inquiries in the area around the housing association flat in Peckford Place, Brixton, south London

The women were seen digging up weeds 
outside as well as visiting shops, and even allegedly chatting to police
 officers on the estate.

It emerged yesterday that the couple suspected of holding the women captive came to Britain in the 1960s.

Scotland
 Yard said the man met the older victims – one Irish, the other 
Malaysian – in London ‘through a shared political ideology’ and they all
 lived together in a ‘collective’.

The commune collapsed but the two women continued to live with the suspects and were subjected to ‘emotional and physical abuse’.

Police said they were so in thrall to their captors they initially refused to let police arrest them after they were rescued.

‘Rose’ is thought to have lived with them all her life but her birth was registered with the authorities – prompting questions as to why health visitors or school bosses never checked up on her. Last night Lambeth Council refused to comment.
