Pippa Middleton and her stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson are apparently eyeing up a new £3million home in Parsons Green, west London.

It was reported last month the two have been on the hunt to find a new home together and it's believed they have now finally found their dream home.

The home features six double bedrooms and a nanny quarters - adding fuel to rumours the couple of two years are planning for a child.

The Sunday Mirror reported the 1900s Victorian-style property features six double bedrooms and a luxury cinema suite alongside the nanny quarters.

A source told the paper: 'The separate living accommodation for childcare is particularly appealing for them which could signal they think starting a family isn't too far off.'

'A little cousin for Prince George might not be out of the question after they set up home.'

Parson's Green is an upmarket suburb located within the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

The area features a host of ritzy bars, restaurants and is known to be frequently by the Made in Chelsea stars.

The local green after which it takes its name is extremely family friendly and is known for being particularly accommodating to dog walkers.

It boasts a number of upmarket bars, restaurants and chain shops including as Little Waitrose, Space NK and Cote Brasserie.

Historically it was an aristocratic suburb and features many Georgian and Victorian properties - such as the one Miss Middleton and Mr Jackson have their eye on.

It is part of the Fulham area which is very much an up and coming location for young families and professionals, with properties going for anything from £300,000 for a tiny one bedroom flat to £3m for large, historic mansions.

Miss Middleton currently lives with her brother James, 27, at a property owned by their parents Carole and Michael.

Mr Jackson, who has been dating Miss Middleton for nearly two years, recently quit his job at Deutsche Bank to take on a new role at a multi-billion pound hedge fund in Geneva.

The long distance aspect of the relationship doesn't appear to be a barrier to their search for a home together, with the couple's house hunting restricted to west London.

The move comes amid growing speculation that he and Miss Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's 30-year-old sister, are about to tie the knot.

In March the couple holidayed with Nico’s grandparents at luxury ski resort Lech in the Austrian Alps.

And the happy couple recently attended the men's Wimbledon final alongside Miss Middleton's parents, Carole and Michael.

The two also live active lives apart - Pippa and her brother James recently completed a cycling race across America with four other men.

They were participating in the Race Across America with the aim of crossing 12 states to raise money for charity, and cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland.
