Arsenal have been dealt a shattering blow with £42million midfielder Mesut Ozil ruled out for up to three months with knee ligament damage.

The fitness verdict came from the German FA, who have sent the midfielder back to Arsenal after scans.

It is another setback for manager Arsene Wenger, who is in the midst of an injury pile-up involving key players, with Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy, Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta all sidelined.

World Cup winner Ozil reported for international duty in Frankfurt with a sore left knee after suffering a knock in Sunday’s 2-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Arsenal asked the Germans to investigate the problem but the club were not impressed to discover the findings broadcast via the DFB’s official Twitter account soon after the injury had been examined by team doctor Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt.

The German FA said Ozil has a ‘partial tear’ of his lateral collateral ligament, will not be fit for the international fixtures against Poland and Republic of Ireland and will not be back for next month’s games against Gibraltar and Spain.

Arsenal’s fitness coach Shad Forsythe also works with Germany — he will step down from his international role after these fixtures — but the north London club refused to confirm the severity of Ozil’s injury until their record signing is back at the club.

They will perform their own assessment of the injury but the 25-year-old is clearly facing a long spell out. 

Wenger hopes to have captain Arteta back from an ankle injury in time for the Barclays Premier League game against Hull on Saturday week.

Ozil has played regularly for Arsenal this season and has shown little sign of an injury

There is also an outside chance Ramsey may also be available as he has responded better than expected to treatment for a hamstring problem. 

Theo Walcott, out since January with a cruciate knee injury, has returned to full training but is not expected to be available for the first team until the end of this month.

Giroud and Debuchy have both been ruled out until the end of the year after ankle operations. Serge Gnabry is out with a knee injury, Yaya Sanogo is out with a hamstring strain, Abou Diaby has had another setback on his return to fitness and Nacho Monreal has been struggling with a nagging back problem.

Hull’s Ahmed Elmohamady has withdrawn from the Egypt squad for two African Nations Cup qualifiers against Botswana with a back problem but is expected be fit to face Arsenal at the Emirates.

The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) goes from the top part of the fibula (the bone on the outside of the lower leg) to the outside part of the lower thigh bone. The ligament helps keep the outer side of the knee joint stable.

The LCL is usually injured by pressure or an injury that pushes the knee joint from the inside, which results in stress on the outside part of the joint. Symptoms include swelling, the knee locking or giving way.
