As the cold weather begins to creep in, thoughts turn to cosy winter pieces.

But forget scarves, cosy knits and bobble hats, because this season's hottest trend is much more impractical. Meet the demi-glove.

The not-quite-there glove, which only covers half the hand, is already a firm favourite of Karl Lagerfeld, Madonna and Demi Lovato.

Leading the trend: Karl Lagerfeld (L) and Demi Lovato (R) are already embracing the demi-glove

The midi handwear is designed to keep your fingers snug but is somewhat sexier than a full glove.

The trend, which was spotted by Look magazine, is already a hit with the blogosphere. Fashion types apparently love the style because it allows them to show off statement wrist candy.

Grazziella Pinto from Fashion Bloodhound, said: 'The demi-glove trend is one that’s here to stay.

'A frequent request of Fashion Bloodhound clients, it’s a trend that the celebs have been trialling for a while and one that fashion house Chanel firmly put on the map.

Famous fan: Madonna has long championed the demi-glove trend, but prefers to embrace the fingerless style

Fashion blogger Laura Candlin, of unlovedbutton, said: 'To me, gloves are what you crack out during the cold winter months to keep you hands nice and toasty not something you use to accessorise an outfit with.

'I have to say if this is going to be the next big trend to hit the fashion world, I don't think it is one that I will be partaking in.'

Celebrity stylist Courtney Smith said: 'The demi-glove or half glove has returned for 2013.

Insta-trend: Bloggers are already jumping on the latest accessories trend

'An accessory that originally came 
around in the eighties but was revisited when it hit fashion headlines 
back in 2009, with brands like Alexander McQueen and Salvatore Ferragamo accesorising their catwalk looks with the winter 
hand warmers.

'Patricia 
Field, legendary costume designer for Sex and the City even put our 
favourite TV style icon Carrie Bradshaw in a pair of her own fingerless gloves.

'Celebrities
already love this look with Kim Kardashian, Demi Lovato and even Paris 
Hilton rocking it in the past.

'They
definitely won't keep you as warm as a full glove, but if you are 
looking for a little Eighties style impact or maybe some finger cleavage
(the new toe cleavage anyone?) then this is definitely a trend worth 
trying out.'
