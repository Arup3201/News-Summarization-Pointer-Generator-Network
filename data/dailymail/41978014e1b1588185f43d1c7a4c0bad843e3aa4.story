Motel staff were shocked when a customer came into their lobby after being shot in the face.

Employees at the Budget Lodge, north of central Phoenix, called for an ambulance around 10.20pm on Monday night, and the man was taken to hospital.

The shooting victim was 'less than cooperative with suspect information' and is believed to have been attempting to purchase drugs when he was shot, Phoenix police told Daily Mail Online.

The man was in critical condition when taken from the budget motel next to Interstate 17, but he is expected to survive.

The shooting is thought to have taken place in a room at the motel, according to the Arizona Republic. 

The highway-side location had developed a reputation as a place for criminal activity before Monday's violent episode. 

A TripAdvisor reviewer who stayed in 2013 said: 'The people staying at the hotel are shady to say the least' and that he felt 'unsafe' in the accommodation.

A 2011 post says that  hypodermic needles were found underneath a bed.

Another review says that the lobby has a sign that 'pledges management will pay $100 for the reporting of drug dealing on the premises'.

Police had not taken anyone into custody in the case as of Tuesday morning.
