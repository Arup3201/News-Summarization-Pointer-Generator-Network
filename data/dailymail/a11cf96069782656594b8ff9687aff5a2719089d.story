What do a £1,000 holiday, nine Mars bars, juggling balls, a broken dog chew and cut-price kebabs have in common?

They are all among the unusual 'thank you' gifts given to police officers in Cambridgeshire.

One female officer was surprised and delighted to be given two pheasants, while other colleagues received four cans of lager, bags of crisps and even a filter for a vacuum cleaner.

A list of presents received by Cambridgeshire police officers has been revealed, and it includes bizarre gifts such as a broken dog chew toy, a free holiday and home-grown potatoes (file picture)

The list of presents received in recent years has been released following a Freedom of Information Act request.

Some were passed on to charity, including a digital radio, food hamper and cash – but not the £1,000 voucher for a free holiday. 

PC Paul Huggett noted that he was given 'one broken dog chew', while a constable in Ely was given a 'small discount' at Ali's Kebabs.

Swavesey Village College gave an officer a bottle of wine and in Ely a member of the public gave a female officer an 'afternoon fishing for her husband'. 

Tickets to the circus, horse races and a Tina Turner concert were also received, along with three cut-throat razors, lunch at Park Lane Hotel and a bag of home-grown potatoes.

Chief Constable Simon Parr received a bottle of port from the Cambridge Magistrates' Association and, just before Christmas, two theatre tickets worth £15 each.  

A Cambridgeshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'The force has an open and honest gratuities and gifts policy which relies on staff and officer honesty and discretion; in-line with the College of Policing's Code of Ethics.

'All staff and officers have to register all offers or acceptances of gifts, including meals and refreshments.

'The purpose of the database is to ensure there is a transparent and auditable process in place.

'In the majority of cases the gifts are small and from members of the public who want to thank officers for the service they have received. Larger gifts are fairly rare.'

He added that officers can accept gifts worth less than £20 in value but anything more valuable needs prior approval from the force's Professional Standards Department.

'In all but the most exceptional circumstances gifts in excess of £50 will become the property of the relevant force,' the spokesman said.

'All cases where approval is sought for gifts over £20 will be logged in the gifts and hospitality register.'
