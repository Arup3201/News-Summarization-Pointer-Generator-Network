Criticism: Lin Homer went from the Border Agency to a £180k HMRC role

The country’s top woman civil servant is clinging to her £180,000-a-year job after being accused by MPs of a 'catastrophic failure of leadership' on securing Britain's borders.

Lin Homer's disastrous tenure in charge of the UK Border Agency lead to a huge backlog of hundreds of thousands of immigration cases.

But astonishingly she emerged unscathed and was rewarded with promotion through the civil service and is now in charge of HM Revenue and Customs.

The powerful home affairs committee today said they were ‘astounded’ she was considered suitable for the job of collecting the nation’s taxes.

Chairman Keith Vaz hit out at 'incompetent' Mrs Homer receiving £20,000 in bonuses despite leaving the UKBA in a 'worst position' than when she started.

There were also signs ministers were finally losing faith with the mandarin.

A senior Whitehall source said: ‘There are increasing concerns from ministers as to why there are no penalties for poor performance in the civil service. Instead what we have is a “promotions-all-round” culture.

‘There needs to be penalties for the worst performers and better career paths for those who are doing well. If someone has a terrible track record of delivery, should they really be being promoted?

‘The civil service does not do talent management properly.’ The select committee accused Mrs Homer of repeatedly misleading MPs and called for Parliament to be given greater say over appointing of top civil servants.

The MPs said: ‘It is shocking that after five years under Lin Homer’s leadership an organisation that was described at the beginning of the period as being not fit for purpose should have improved its performance so little.

‘Given this background, we are astounded Mrs Homer has been promoted to become chief executive and permanent secretary at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.’

UK Border Agency has been heavily criticised after it emerged backlog would take 24 years to clear

Born in Norfolk, Ms Homer studied law at University College London, before working at Reading Council for two years then Hertfordshire Council, where over a period of 15 years, she rose to the position of Director of Corporate Services.

This proved the springboard for her first major town hall job, in 1998, as chief executive of Suffolk Council.

Just four years later, the married mother of three daughters was parachuted into the same post at Birmingham City Council, on a jaw-dropping £174,000-year.

In 2005 she was accused of throwing ‘the rule book out of the window’ in a major postal votes scandal in Birmingham that ended up before the courts.

Election judge Richard Mawrey said fraud in the city ‘would have disgraced a banana republic’. He described Mrs Homer’s decision to allow postal ballot papers to be transported to the count in shopping bags as ‘the direst folly’.

But later that year she was chosen by the Home Office to run what was then called the Immigration and Nationality Directorate – this time on £200,000, plus bonuses.

Already in chaos, it was on her watch in 2006 that we learned of the mistaken release of 1,000 foreign criminals.

It later emerged some 450,000 asylum cases had not been dealt with but left in boxes at the Home Office.

The new UKBA was meant to clear up the mess, and Mrs Homer became its first chief executive, on an astonishing £208,000 a year.

But among a fresh run of scandals was the revelation that nearly 400 of the 1,000 foreign prisoners were told they could stay in Britain and dozens remained untraced.

Promotion came again in 2011 when she was handed the the post of Permanent Secretary at the Transport Department where she stayed for barely a year before winning her biggest job to date – running HMRC.

Since then she has been criticised for failing to tackle tax avoidance, admitting in November last year that over half of Britain’s biggest 770 firms funnel profits overseas.

In a damning indictment of her abilities, the MPs say they can 'have little confidence in her ability to lead HMRC at what is a challenging time for that organisation'.

It points out that the woman oversaw a huge backlog in immigration cases at UKBA has since admitted that her new department at HMRC left 1million letters  unanswered throughout 2012.

Today Mr Vaz insisted senior civil servants involved in the chaos should not be rewarded with new plum jobs.

'People
 just can’t go on to be promoted to other jobs unless they answer for 
what’s happened. She has apologised, but we felt that more should have 
been done,' he told BBC Radio 4.

Ministers were repeatedly not given 
accurate data on immigration levels. 'Most of this happened under the 
leadership of Lin Homer when she headed the UKBA for five years, despite
 getting bonuses of £20,000,' Mr Vaz added.

'When she left the organisation, I’m 
afraid, it was left it something of a worst position than she arrived. 
We now have a third of a million cases in backlog. We should actually 
rename this agency: United Kingdom Backlog Agency because of the number 
of things not dealt with.'

He added that letters sent by Mrs 
Homer to the committee were 'frankly incompetent' and he had to 
'introduce her to pie charts and graphs' to ensure the information was 
accurate.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers are sick to death of senior civil servants 
presiding over failure only to move on without being held to account for
 their past actions.

‘At worst Whitehall rewards the incompetent with payoffs or promotions, at best it just shuffles them sideways.’

But
 Mrs Homer has written to MPs saying: ‘It is wholly inaccurate and 
unfair to seek to ascribe responsibility to me for matters of concern 
that occurred long after I left the agency.’

This is despite MPs today warning that border officials require 24 years to clear their backlog of 320,000 immigration cases.

Incompetence and foot-dragging is blamed for the sheer number of claims – the equivalent of the population of Iceland.

In
 a blistering report, the Commons home affairs committee also said the 
army of foreign criminals on the streets was growing, with the total now
 almost 4,000.

The audit into the work of the UK Border Agency, which was dubbed not fit for purpose six years ago, found 321,726 outstanding cases involving immigrants.

These include 28,500 current asylum cases, 4,000 immigration cases and 181,541 people placed in a so-called Migration Refusal Pool.

The pool comprises migrants who arrived legally but cannot now be found after their work or study visas expired. Officials say many of the migrants will have gone home – a view disputed by the MPs, who say the lack of proper border checks may mean ‘tens of thousands’ are still here.

They are highly critical of the slow pace at which officials are clearing the backlog. Between July and September last year, it was reduced by only 3,430 – or 1 per cent.

This is despite officials writing off 74,000 cases held in the separate ‘asylum controlled archive’ over that period.

Keith Vaz, right, said hardly any progress is being made in clearing the backlog, while Immigration Minister Mark Harper, left, said the UK Border Agency is a 'troubled organisation'

The controlled archive was created to 
hold what remains of Labour’s asylum backlog. It was intended to hold 
cases that had not been concluded, so they could be reopened if the 
person was traced.

UKBA officials had been tracking them down – but decided to abandon those they couldn’t find. Critics say it amounts to have an effective ‘amnesty’.

Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the home affairs committee, said hardly any progress was being made in clearing the backlog. He holds former UKBA chief executive Lin Homer – Britain’s most senior female mandarin – responsible for much of the debacle.

She is clinging to her job in charge of HM Revenue & Customs after MPs concluded she was guilty of a ‘catastrophic’ failure of leadership during her time at UKBA.

Mr Vaz said: ‘No sooner is one backlog closed, than four more are discovered.

‘At this rate it will take 24 years to clear the backlog which still stands at the size of the population of Iceland.’ Also within the backlog are 3,980 foreign criminals who cannot be deported and have been released on bail by the courts.

This has increased by 26 in only three 
months, despite repeated government promises to kick the offenders out. 
Six years ago the asylum backlog scandal prompted then home secretary 
John Reid to brand the immigration system ‘not fit for purpose’.

The committee recommends senior UKBA staff are not paid bonuses until there is evidence the backlog is being ‘substantially’ reduced and new backlogs are not emerging.

Yvette Cooper, Labour’s home affairs spokesman, said: ‘This highly critical report shows that practical failings in the immigration system are getting worse.’

Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘We have always been clear the UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation with a poor record of delivery.

‘Turning it around will take time but I am determined to provide the public with an immigration system they can have confidence in.’

The Border Agency has awarded a £30million contract to outsourcing firm Capita to help track illegals. It began work in October.
