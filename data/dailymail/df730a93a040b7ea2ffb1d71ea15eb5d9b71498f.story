Many women do not understand what constitutes domestic violence and awareness of the issue is 'shockingly low', new research has revealed.

More than half of 2,000 women aged 16-55 either disagreed or did not know if excessive jealousy counted as domestic violence, the survey by commissioned by Avon found.

Singer and Britain's Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon led a group of women - including survivors of domestic violence and victim's families - who marched across Westminster Bridge to present the findings at the Houses of Parliament and demand action today.

She said: 'One in four women will experience 
domestic violence in their lives, making it the single biggest issue 
that will affect young women and their peers in their life.

'Yet the results of this research show that awareness of domestic violence is still 
shockingly low and that's why it's so important that we raise awareness 
about a subject that is too often ignored.'

Charities including Avon, Refuge and Women's Aid want domestic violence to receive the same level of attention as other high-profile issues such as drink-driving.

The campaigners are demanding action from the Government to reduce domestic violence against women

The research found around one in five 16 to 18-year-olds did 
not think or were unsure if pressure from a partner to have sex or do 
other sexual things constituted domestic violence,  while the same number were unsure if slapping or hitting was a sign of domestic violence.

Nearly half either disagreed 
or did not know if going through a female partner's private electronic 
messages counted as domestic violence.

Just over half either disagreed or did not know whether a partner making all the monetary 
decisions was domestic violence.

But more than half of the women 
questioned said they knew or suspected that someone in their life had 
experienced domestic violence.

Two women are killed by current or 
former partners every week in England and Wales.

Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said: 'This issue is still shrouded in myth and misunderstanding. The Government needs to invest in powerful awareness-raising campaigns to change the attitudes that allow violence and fear to darken so many homes up and down the country.

'It is essential that unhealthy attitudes and beliefs about violence against women in all professional and public spheres are challenged and addressed too.

'Changing social attitudes is not an add-on. It is at the very root of preventing and ending domestic violence.'

Polly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid, said: 'It is terrifying that many young women do not know where to get help if they are experiencing domestic violence, although that is to be expected when so few young people have been taught about domestic violence at school.

'Women's Aid has developed a free downloadable teaching resource, but at the moment it is a choice for schools if they decide to educate about healthy relationships.

'If we are going to reduce the level of domestic violence in the future, and educate those directly affected now about where they can go for help and support, we need the Government to support statutory education about relationships for all young people.'
