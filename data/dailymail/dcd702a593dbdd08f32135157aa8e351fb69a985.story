A retired paramedic has won a seven-year battle with British Gas after he was hassled for £1,100 in unpaid bills - despite never using gas in his home. 

Cyril Richardson, 78, was threatened with legal action and a warrant to enter his Shropshire home by solicitors representing the energy giant.

British Gas claimed the retired paramedic owed them £1,100 in gas bills even though the meter reading at his Shrewsbury house had not changed since the day he moved in, back in 2007.

Even with photographic evidence to prove this, the 78-year-old endured letters threatening him with disconnection and forced entry to his flat at the hands of debt collectors.

Mr Richardson did use British Gas for his electricity supply, but he never needed to use gas in his home as all his appliances are electric.

The seven-year nightmare was finally resolved after he was forced hire a solicitor to fight back against the claims.

But when he asked for compensation, British Gas offered just £50 as a 'goodwill gesture', which he has declined.

'It has been a terrible time for the past seven years,' said Mr Richardson.

'They just didn't want to listen. They were adamant that I owed them money, even when I could prove I didn't.

'From the very start I told them that although I used electric, I didn't use gas.

'But they carried on regardless sending me letters threatening legal action, that they were going to get a warrant to enter my property and that they would disconnect my supply.

'And the bill kept getting bigger and bigger. I pay for everything by cash, I have no debts and this was very worrying for me.'

Mr Richardson was first billed £179.15 just months after he moved in to the flat in Shrewsbury.

In November 2007 he tried to move electricity supplier to either npower or Southern Electric but British Gas objected to the move due to the 'unpaid' gas bills.

By May 2008 the bill had reached £447.54 and by July 2009 had risen to £687.94. It had then gone to £859.82 in March 2010.

Over the next few years the bill grew and grew until last month it had reached £1,100.28.

He added: 'I just didn't know what to do.

'They said the debt had been passed to a collections agency.

'Citizens Advice spoke to British Gas as far back as 2007 and we were told then to 'forget all about it' by their adviser.

'But in 2008 they were still sending me bills and we were telling them that I wasn't using any gas.

'They finally removed the meter and the matter is closed.'

Mr Richardson has asked British Gas for compensation for the letters, phone calls and heartache they caused, but has not even received an apology. 

A spokeswoman for British Gas said: 'I am very sorry for the distress caused by the errors with Mr Richardson's gas account.

'We did not act as quickly as we should have to correct the account details.

'We have apologised for this and for the incorrect final bill that we sent.

'We will be contacting Mr Richardson again to explain how this happened and to resolve the issue.'
