Mother-of-four Leighanne Rumbelow, 26, sent abusive and threatening messages to herself, pretending to be student Leonard Smith, 21

A mother-of-four who tried to frame a fellow student by sending herself abusive and threatening emails using his video game username has been jailed for eleven months. 

A police helicopter was scrambled and police dog units searched the area around Leighanne Rumbelow's house, in Foxborough Gardens, Brockley, south London, twice in the hunt for innocent Bromley College student Leonard Smith.

Mr Smith, 21, was arrested three times, had his family home searched, electronic equipment seized and spent a total of thirty-five hours in police custody during the 'sustained, extended campaign' to frame him.

Rumbelow, 26, initially blamed her sister for sending the emails but pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice between April 4 and June 2 last year.

Woolwich Crown Court heard on Wednesday that Rumbelow, using Mr Smith's gaming username, 'Striker', sent herself emails which read: 'You'll have to watch your back. I know where your daughters are.

'You're [sic] life is over and so are your kids. I know you are home. I'll get you, your husband won't mind, you're a slut.

'Your husband is next. We'll get him when he's walking home.

'I can see you shutting your curtains. Goodnight, sleep well.'

Prosecutor Neil Ross told the court: 'There was a persistent and deliberate series of false allegations against Mr Smith that led to his arrest, the seizure of property and considerable use of his time and resources.'

In 2011 Rumbelow accused Mr Smith of touching her sexually, but the police did not pursue her complaint and early last year he tried to contact her on Facebook to 'clear the air'.

'As a result she went to the police and said she was being harassed and Mr Smith was given a warning,' explained Mr Ross.

Rumbelow wrote herself abusive and threatening emails from 'Striker', and told police she wanted Mr Smith arrested.

Mr Smith was arrested in the early hours of April 6 last year and was released shortly afterwards, but found himself in police custody again on April 7 - this time for twenty hours - when officers again attended his address in the middle of the night.

On April 10, 14 and 22 Rumbelow repeated her lies, telling officers that she spotted Mr Smith in her garden, from where he emailed further threats.

This led to a helicopter search and sniffer dogs being dispatched to the surrounding area.

On May 31 Rumbelow told police she received another email from Mr Smith which read: 'I see you are cheating on me again. I'm going to slit your throat you dirty little slag.'

'Phone the police and I swear you'll get it,' read another email, resulting in Mr White spending another five hours in police custody.

Officers became suspicious and it was revealed that the IP address of the 'Striker' emails was traced to the home Rumbelow shared with her mother and sister.

A police helicopter was scrambled and police dog units searched the area around Leighanne Rumbelow's house in Brockley, South London, Woolwich Crown Court heard.

Emma Stuart Smith, defending, told the court: 'She's vulnerable due to her emotional and mental health condition. She realises she was selfish in her actions.' 

Mr Smith said in a statement: 'The whole ordeal was very distressing.'

Judge Alan Saggerson said: 'This is an offence of great severity and gravity. The offence brought with it a high level of harm.

'The public confidence in the entire criminal justice system is undermined when allegations are fabricated against innocent people and resources are wasted making inquiries, using helicopters and dog units and wasting police man hours.

'Not only was an innocent man arrested three times during your extended sequence of lies, spending thirty-five hours in custody, but you also caused suspicion to fall on other innocent people, including his mother and sister and their property was searched.

'Suspicion also fell on your own mother and sister, particularly your sister, who you continued to blame.

'This was not a single, isolated allegation, but a sustained, extended campaign in creating these false emails.

'They were repeated messages that you fabricated to to sustain your fictitious claims and must have involved significant thought and planning on your part.'
