An Al Qaeda bomber sent to blow up a U.S.-bound airliner was actually a double agent who infiltrated the group and volunteered for the suicide mission, it has been revealed.

Saudi Arabia's intelligence agency placed the undercover operator inside Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) where he convinced his handlers to give him the new type of non-metallic bomb.

The agent, who was in Yemen, was liaising with the CIA before handing the device over to intelligence services.

AQAP have been identified as the most dangerous and determined branch of the terror network.

The explosive device was supposed to be smuggled aboard an aircraft undetected and then detonated.

The revelation, first reported by The Los Angeles Times, shows how the CIA was able to get its hands on a sophisticated underwear bomb well before an attack was set in motion.

The agent arrived safely in an unidentified country and is being debriefed.

Experts at the FBI's bomb laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, are now analysing the device to see if it could have evaded airport security. 

It did not contain metal, meaning it probably could have passed through an airport metal detector.

But it is not clear whether new body scanners used in many airports would have detected it.

If such a device could be smuggled through, it could in theory be detonated before passengers or crew knew it was on board.

It appeared to be an upgraded version of
 the so-called 'underwear bomb' that failed to down a passenger jet over
 Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.

A bombing was to be carried out, reports suggest, to mark the first anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden.

'Like that bomb, this device bears the forensic signature of feared Al Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri,' who is believed to be hiding in Yemen, the LA Times website reported.          

The operation relied not on the high-tech and satellite surveillance for which the CIA has been known in recent years, but old-fashioned human intelligence work.   

It did, however, produce intelligence that helped the CIA locate top Al Qaeda operative Fahd al-Qasaa, who was killed on Sunday when a CIA drone targeted him with a missile as he stepped out of his car in Yemen.

Two counter-terrorism officials told the New York Daily News they believed 37-year-old al-Quso, who had a $5million bounty on his head, was the key militant behind the plans.

Al-Quso was indicted in the U.S. for his role in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in the harbour of Aden, Yemen, in which 17 American sailors were killed and 39 injured.

He was later believed to have replaced 
Anwar al-Awlaki as the Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula's head of 
external operations when the latter was killed in a U.S. airstrike last 
year.

Senator
 Dianne Feinstein, of California, who heads the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, said yesterday she had been briefed about an 'undetectable' 
device that was 'going to be on a U.S.-bound airliner.'

There were no immediate plans to change security procedures at U.S. airports.

However, there are claims that extra air marshals have been deployed across Europe to protect U.S.-bound jets.

Flights out of Gatwick Airport, in England, reportedly received 100 percent coverage.

The 'would-be suicide bomber', based in Yemen and believed to be working for al-Quso, had not been given a target plane or bought his tickets when the CIA seized the bomb.

White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said President Obama learned about the plot in April.

All passengers on U.S.-bound flights are checked against terrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases.

In
 some countries, U.S. officials are stationed in airports to offer 
advice on security matters.

In some cases, though, the U.S. is limited 
to hoping that other countries follow the security advice from the 
Transportation Security Administration.

The Christmas 2009 bombing 
originated in Amsterdam, where the bomber did not receive a full-body 
scan. And in 2010, terrorists smuggled bombs onto cargo jets, which 
receive less scrutiny than passenger planes.

In
 both those instances, the bombs were made by Al Qaeda's master bomb 
maker in Yemen, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri. Officials believe this latest 
bomb was the handiwork of al-Asiri or one of his students.

Armed sky marshals were introduced on British airliners in 2003 in response to fears of a 9/11-style terror attack launched from airports in the UK.

Then Home Secretary David Blunkett said the move, which was confined to transatlantic routes, was a ‘proportionate and appropriate response’ to the terror threat against this country.

At the time, reports indicated that plain-clothes officers would carry guns firing low-velocity bullets, to prevent one going through the target and piercing the shell of the plane.

In all likelihood they would be seated near the cockpit, in first or business class. Passengers are never notified if an air marshal is on their plane, although pilots are told.

Neither the airline industry, police nor Government officials will comment publicly on the policy, and since its introduction it has largely been shrouded in secrecy.

Other countries are more open about their use of sky marshals. The Israeli national airline, El Al, has had an armed marshal on every flight for more than a decade. And air marshals have been used in the US for more than 30 years.

To anti-terror investigators, there was little that marked out Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as a potential Al Qaeda recruit and suicide bomber.

As the son of one of Nigeria’s most prominent businessmen, the 25-year-old former British university student lived a privileged life with access to large funds, homes in three countries and international travel.

During his time studying mechanical engineering at University College London, he was described as a ‘quiet, caring, diligent student’.

Investigators admit he ‘simply did not fit their profile’ of a potential terrorist.

Yet on Christmas Day 2009, Abdulmutallab came close to blowing up a packed transatlantic flight with explosives sewn into his underwear.

He flew from Lagos to Amsterdam, then boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit, which was carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew. Hours into the flight, he tried to detonate the explosives by injecting chemicals into them.

He suffered severe burns when the bomb failed to explode, and was overpowered by passengers and crew.

Disturbingly, the bomb was not picked up in airport security checks in Lagos and Amsterdam.

Now serving a life prison sentence in the United States, Abdulmutallab is certain to be questioned again about his bomb, its maker and those who supplied it.

In London, he was president of the university’s Islamic Society and ‘crossed the radar screen’ of MI5, the UK’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency, for radical links and communications with Islamic extremists.

But investigators say that Al Qaeda operatives identified Abdulmutallab  only as ‘vulnerable’ and did not target him until after he began studying Arabic in the Yemeni capital San’aa in August 2009.

Suspect: Authorities believe the updated underwear bomb was the work of master bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri

Al-Qaeda's most feared bomb maker is believed to be behind the foiled plot to bring down a U.S.-bound airliner.

Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri was responsible for the so-called underpants bomb which was supposed to blow up on Christmas Day in 2009.

Experts said the new device handed over to the CIA by the double agent who was operating in Yemen bears the same forensic signature.

U.S. authorities believe the weapon was either made by Al-Asiri or one of his students and they described it as an upgraded version of the bomb used in the 2009 plot.

Al-Asiri, 30, is believed to be hiding in Yemen where he arrived in 2006 after being jailed by Saudi officials in crackdowns against Islamic militants.

The twist this time was an absence of metal, which could have made the device undetectable by conventional airport scanners.

'It was a threat from a standpoint of the design,' said John Brennan, President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser.

His younger brother, Abdullah, also made the trek to Yemen as they turned their backs on their father, a four-decade veteran of the Saudi military.

In Yemen's rugged northern mountains, they met with fugitive Yemeni militant Nasser al-Wahishi, a former aide to Osama Bin Laden, and became the nucleus of the new Al Qaiea affiliate, said the magazine account, which could not be independently confirmed.

They later brought in U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki as a powerful propaganda voice in the West. Al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. airstrike last September.

U.S. intelligence officials at first believed al-Asiri also was killed in the attack, but their suspicions were proven wrong several weeks later.

After the failed Christmas 2009 bombing, investigators pulled al-Asiri's fingerprint off the bomb hidden in the underwear of the Nigerian-born suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, aboard the Northwest Airlines flight.

Less than a year later, al-Asiri was linked to the discovery of printer cartridges packed with PETN and sent by international courier with Chicago-area synagogues listed as the destination.

The explosive-rigged packages - believed powerful enough to bring down a plane - were pulled off airplanes in England and the United Arab Emirates.

Al-Asiri became a major focus of America's anti-terrorism efforts. In March 2011, Washington officially designed al-Asiri as a wanted terrorist, calling him the primary bombmaker for AQAP. It also presumably puts al-Asiri among the chief targets on the U.S. hit list.

Since
 the terror attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda has 
put different types of plans into action in numerous Jihad plots. While 
none of the plots have been successful, they have brought change to 
airport screenings and other security measures.
