Jack Wilshere believes England's World Cup preparation was 'perfect' and they 'didn't get enough credit' for the tournament.

The Arsenal midfielder was adamant that despite England's failure to win a game at the tournament, they 'did a lot of positive things' and have been unfairly criticised.

In an interview with talkSPORT, Wilshere also claimed England were 'excellent' going forward in Brazil, despite only scoring twice in three games.

'We were one of the best prepared teams at the World Cup,' the 22-year-old said.

'Our preparation was perfect. Everyone did everything that was required. I don't think we got enough credit for the World Cup.

'Ok, we didn't get where we wanted to in the competition, and that was massively disappointing, but if you analyse the games a bit deeper, we did a lot of positive things that people were telling us to do.

'We went forward, and it was only a few individual mistakes that let us down, and at that level you get punished.

'In the Premier League sometimes you can get away with it, but at that level, with players like Luis Suarez and Mario Balotelli, they'll punish you.

'Unfortunately we didn't get the results we wanted, but if you look back at the videos, going forward we were excellent.

'Defensively we could have been better as a team, not as a defence but as a team we could have been a bit more compact and harder to beat.

'But going forward we were fantastic.' 

New era: With Gerrard (left) and Lampard departed from the midfield Wilshere has a chance to shine

The young Gunner also said he believed England were entering a 'new era' after the international retirements of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard.

'It's a new era if you like. We've got a new captain, we've got younger players in the squad, so we're moving forward as a nation.'
