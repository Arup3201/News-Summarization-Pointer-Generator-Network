Caroline Wozniacki is already getting in shape for the 2015 season as she bids to finally claim that elusive Grand Slam title.

The Danish former world No 1 shared a video on Instagram of her off-season training in a Dubai gym.

Wozniacki started with some impressive skipping, then jumped on the treadmill and finished on the leg press machine before giving a thumbs up to the camera.
