Postmen are poised to boycott delivery of half the country’s letters, leaving Britain’s mail system on the brink of chaos.

An overwhelming majority voted for the measure, which raises the prospect of urgent mail such as debit cards, gas bills and bank statements being abandoned at Royal Mail delivery offices.

One in two letters delivered each day are handled by one of Royal Mail’s rivals, TNT Post and UK Mail, which print their insignia on the envelope.

Fury: A union ballot of Royal Mail staff has displayed their anger at plans to privatise the company. Workers could also refuse to work with competitor mail firms

Royal Mail is responsible only for the ‘final mile’ of the delivery –  that is, putting the letter through  your letterbox.

In a consultative ballot, the 
Communication Workers’ Union asked its members if they supported ‘the 
boycott of competitors’ mail’.

Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, says the message from Royal Staff to the Government is 'loud and clear'

The results, published yesterday, were
 clear. Of the 112,414 ballot papers which were sent out, 75,662 came 
back with a ‘yes’, equal to a vote of 67 per cent. Just 6,996 said ‘no’.

Yesterday the CWU did not name a date 
for the boycott to begin, but warned it could last indefinitely. Its 
impact could be devastating.

Many of Britain’s biggest companies 
use the services of Royal Mail’s rivals, including Santander, Barclays, 
Lloyds Banking Group, Tesco, Npower, Sky, E.On, Thames Water and 
TalkTalk.

Royal Mail delivers around 58million 
letters every day. The workers’ boycott would be unlawful if it went ahead in the next week - thanks to a High Court ruling. But if it eventually goes ahead, mountains of mail could 
pile up in delivery offices around the country.

CWU members were also 
overwhelmingly against the privatisation of Royal Mail, with 70 per cent
 of those balloted saying they were ‘opposed’.

Ministers are planning to float the 
business on the stock market, a move which even Margaret Thatcher 
opposed. She said she was ‘not prepared to have the Queen’s head 
privatised’.

They have pledged to give 10 per cent 
of Royal Mail shares to its workers, but the CWU yesterday dismissed the
 prospect of free, or discounted, shares.

Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of
 the CWU, said: ‘Postal workers are not going to sacrifice their souls 
for a so-called 10 per cent stake when they know their jobs, pensions 
and conditions are once again under threat.’

Until January 2006, Royal Mail had a 
monopoly on all mail in this country. Since this was axed, it has 
rapidly lost its key business customers.

A statement from Royal Mail said any industrial action could not only hurt the company financially but are also unlawful

At present, ‘around half of the daily 
post bag’ is made up of mail which has been handled by a rival, 
according to Royal Mail. Last year, TNT handled 3.8billion letters, 
compared with 1.1billion in 2006. UK Mail said it handled around 
2.7billion.

Royal Mail is obliged to deliver every piece of mail to every address in the country, however remote.

But its rivals can simply cherry  pick
 the best contracts, such as a high-street banking giant, without ever 
having to worry about getting a second-class postcard from Cornwall to 
Carlisle, for example.

Many people already use the internet 
to access their mobile phone and bank accounts. And yesterday a Royal 
Mail spokesman warned the boycott would further encourage the public to 
ditch letters in favour of emails.

He said: ‘Any action against letters 
[handled by rivals] and parcels would adversely impact on large numbers 
of the general public and the postal industry as a whole by increasing 
e-substitution. It would also severely impact on our business, our 
reputation and that of our employees.’

Fears: The union says workers' jobs, pensions and conditions would be under threat if the privatisation plans went ahead

Business minister Michael Fallon said he was ‘disappointed’ by the result of the ballot opposing privatisation.

'Everyone agrees that Royal Mail needs to change if we are to protect the future of the six-day-a-week, one-price-goes-anywhere service'

He said: ‘Everyone agrees that Royal 
Mail needs to change if we are to protect the future of the 
six-day-a-week, one-price-goes-anywhere service.’

A TNT spokesman said it ‘would work 
with Royal Mail to minimise any disruption to our customers’ if the 
threatened boycott goes ahead.

After legal action by Royal Mail 
yesterday, CWU has promised not to begin the boycott before June 28, 
when a further High Court hearing will take place.
