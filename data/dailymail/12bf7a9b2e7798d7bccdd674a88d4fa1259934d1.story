A pioneering, minimally-invasive fat reduction procedure promises to leave you sculpted and slim - with no scarring.

Microcannula tumescent liposuction - dubbed MicroLipo - is performed under local anaesthetic using tiny steel tubes which can measure less than a millimetre.

The size of the wound left means any scars will fade until they are almost invisible.

MicroLipo involves a diluted local anaesthesia being injected into areas, and then removing fat with tiny tubes

Cannula sizes range from 0.9mm to 3mm, much smaller than those used for traditional - and Vaser - liposuction. Their small size makes them particularly good for targeting smaller body areas such 
as bingo wings, chin, inner thighs, flanks, abdomen and chest.

One of the latest bodyshaping treatments, MicroLipo removes unwanted fat and sculpts targeted areas of the body to provide for better definition, and can remove 
up to 3.5 litres of fat in total. 

Traditional liposuction, with larger 
cannulas, removes fat relatively quickly, which 
increases the risk of irregularities and depressions in the skin. The 
use of microcannulas, on the other hand, allows smoother and more 
uniform results.

MicroLipo is the brainchild of US-based 
Dr. Jeffrey Klein. There is currently just one surgeon qualified to perform the operation in Europe, Dr Gupta of The Private Clinic on Harley Street, London. He has performed well over 1,500 MicroLipo procedures in his time.

There's a problem area on many 
women's bodies that nobody talks about. It's not unsightly, not bumpy, 
not lumpy - and not visible.

But
the painful friction caused by rubbing inner thighs is the bane of many women's lives - mine included. The affliction has burdened me ever since I can 
remember.

Even as a 
size eight teenager, my slight knock-knees and upper inner thigh fat 
meant I suffered painful rubbing and, until now, I chose to accept that as 
my lifelong fate. No matter how much I exercised or dieted, the hot, raw thigh rub would not cease.

Minimally invasive MicroLipo changed my thighs: Before (l) and after (r)

I
spent summers in clear tights and jeans when all I wanted was to go 
bare-legged or wear shorts. I even discovered Charnos no-toes tights which 
allowed me to wear sandals. I own countless pairs and wore them 
religiously all summer.

But
last week, for the first time ever, I allowed myself a day in a dress 
with bare legs. And, while my thighs grazed very slightly, there was no 
friction. I was pain and carefree all day. I couldn't stop smiling - 
and I still can't now.

'Lipo traffic as a whole is up 32 per cent year on year in the UK. This includes laser lipolysis, Vaser, and non surgical lipo effectively.

'Vaser lipo is actually down 5 per cent year on year - there has been quite a marked drop in traffic over the last four months in particular.

'Surgical lipo traffic is up 47 per cent year on year.'

The idea of being battered and bruised on an operating table terrifies me, so it was the words 'no scars' and 'minimally invasive' that sold me on MicroLipo.

After
my initial consultation with Dr Gupta, he said he could take a litre of
fat out of each leg. This figure seemed high to me, so I asked him to 
take less if he could, and to focus on just the chubby bit at the top.

He stressed that to achieve a finessed and natural look, the whole upper 
inner thigh would need sculpting - from knee to groin. I accepted his 
expert opinion.

On the 
day of the procedure I was given several sedative pills and taken into 
the operating room where my legs were marked with a blue pen.

Dr Gupta injected each thigh with a lot of local 
anaesthetic solution making them swell and firm. This helps separate the fat cells from the other surrounding tissue and minimises blood loss.

Fat
removal then commenced via about ten entry points on each leg. I could feel something in my leg, but no pain. It was strange, but not as strange as I 
thought it would be. He removed up to 800ml of fat from each thigh. Four
hours after I entered the building, wrapped in dressings and trussed up in post-operative garments, I was in a cab on my way home.

The operation took four hours from entering the building to getting a taxi home

I had taken the week off and went to my mother's the next morning. I was close to immobile for this time and hobbled for the next couple of weeks after that - so I will say you can't go straight back to work. Also, I was in post-operative garments and dressings meaning I couldn't wear normal clothes.

During the recovery time, my thighs looked irregular. They were bruised, hard and lumpy and I worried about the final result. Dr Gupta recommended special post-lipo lymphatic massage and two sessions worked wonders in speeding up recovery.

While downtime was more intense and longer than I imagined, it's now been six weeks and the swelling is almost completely gone. I can hardly see any marks or evidence I ever had anything done and my thighs are almost even and totally soft and smooth.

The benefits of Dr Gupta's insistence on working from knee to groin are evident to me now. My leg shape is a lot straighter and, more importantly, it all looks entirely natural.

At just 23, some might say I am too young
to make the decision to under the knife. But to me, all it means is 
that I get to live more of my life in comfort.

'As long as the patient is fit and 
well then there is no reason why someone who is in their twenties cannot
recover from the procedure just as quickly as a person in their forties
or fifties,' says Dr Gupta.

Explaining my mild discomfort at times, Dr Gupta continues: 'A patient 
who is slightly older may find the procedure and recovery process 
slightly easier as their skin is likely to be slightly slacker and 
looser. However this is not always the case; every patient is 
different.'

The price of MicroLipo on the inner thigh isn't as terrifying as one might think. It all depends on the amount of fat and areas requiring treatment. The cost of the procedure I went for is just at the beginning of the threshold - much less than I would have assumed.

Since
deciding to go ahead with the operation I have spoken more openly
about the affliction I found awkward for so long. I am only a size 
10 to 12 and painful chafing was, in my mind, reserved for heavier 
frames. But to my surprise - and relief - many shared 
my concerns.

I recently went for a massage and told my therapist about my operation. 
She, a size 10 herself, had suffered painful inner thigh chafing her whole life - she calls it 'nappy
rash'.

The big, warm hug she gave me after I 
wrote down my surgeon's number for her told me that we need to 
talk about this more. There are things we can do to improve the situation, be 
it rocking 90s revival flouro cycling shorts under our dresses, no-toes 
tights - or even a spot of MicroLipo.

MicroLipo costs from £2,600. Visit theprivateclinic.co.uk or call 0800 599 9911
