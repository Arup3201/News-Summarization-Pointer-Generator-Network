A middle-class mother with £300,000 in a Swiss bank account and children in top fee-paying schools carried on claiming benefits as 'pocket money', a court was told today.

Caroline Foxley, 58, was  a 'greedy' woman who had made a 'calm, calculated and rational' decision to abuse the benefits system out of more than £20,000, Gloucester Crown Court heard. 

She is alleged to have claimed income support, Jobseeker's Allowance and council tax and housing benefits, while she had more than £300,000 in the bank. 

Caroline Foxley, 58, of Teignmouth, Devon,is accused of committing a £20,000 benefits fraud

Ms Foxley, formerly of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, but now living in Teignmouth, Devon, denies four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009.

The court heard the interest she was receiving on her money was around £300 every couple of weeks - more than the benefits she was claiming.

Yet when she filled out forms certifying she still qualified for benefits she said she had only £100 in a Lloyds TSB account.

'This case is about greed really,' said prosecutor Stephen Mooney. 

'It involves her making a calm, calculated and rational decision, in fact quite a number of them, to top up her already quite substantial income by making false claims for benefit.'

He told the court Foxley had abused a system designed to be a safety net for people unable to finance their lives and in danger of ending up sleeping rough on the streets.

He added: 'It is not supposed to be a source of pocket money or additional income for wealthy people like Ms Foxley who decide that is what they would like.

'It is the prosecution case that this is a thoroughly dishonest woman who decided to get money she knew she was not entitled to in the hope and expectation, and arrogance, that she would not be caught.

'Greedy people bank on not being caught but this was a gamble in respect of which this woman failed.'

The benefit rules did not allow anyone with more than £16,000 in the bank to be paid any State benefits, he said.

She paid the money into an Indian bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to Cheltenham Ladies' College (pictured), it was said

Until March 30th 2007 she did qualify but she then sold a house which made her £306,000, said Mr Mooney. She paid the money into an Indian bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to Cheltenham Ladies' College, Malvern College and Bloxham School, Banbury, he said.

'These are not cheap schools,' he said. 'Between 2007 and 2009 when she was claiming poverty and penury she paid in the region of £48,000 to Bloxham School.

'This was a woman who had certain high expectations and standards for her children and a sense that she was entitled to a particular standard of living and she was going to have it come what may.

'You would either have to be colossally stupid or fraudulently dishonest to continue claiming benefits when you had £306,000 in the bank.'

During the course of the alleged deceptions, he said, she transferred her money into Habibsons Bank - a Swiss bank with a branch in London.

'No doubt she was taking advantage of the notorious and well documented reluctance of the Gnomes of Zurich to give out information about their bank accounts.The money went back to Zurich, spirited away, no doubt, to be used by Ms Foxley.'

Mr Mooney said that when the alleged frauds were detected Ms Foxley was 'like a chameleon on a tartan hook' not knowing which way to turn when questioned by investigators.

Her explanation was 'like a sort of fraudster's equivalent of "the dog ate my homework",' he said. She claimed the money in the account was not hers and was needed by her ex husband in Italy to settle debts.

She produced a document to support that claim but the prosecution alleged it was a false document, he went on.

'What we have here is a woman who has been caught out and frankly she doesn't like being caught out. She regards it as rather an affront that those perhaps less clever than her, less sophisticated than her, and less entitled than her, should have the right to pursue her.

'And all this at a time when the poorest in society are having their entitlement to benefits cut from beneath them because of the austerity which affects all of us - but not her.

'This is a case of someone using the benefits system as their own pocket money to help finance an already wealthy lifestyle.' 

The case continues.
