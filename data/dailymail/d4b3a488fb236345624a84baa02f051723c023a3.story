This is the shocking moment a horse collapsed and died while pulling tourists up a steep hill at Shenzhen Safari Park in China.

The upsetting incident occurred in front of children and has sparked outrage on Chinese social media and accusations that the emaciated animal died from overwork and neglect.

Facing massive criticism, the zoo claims that the horse died from a heart attack, not malnourishment or exhaustion. 

Shocking: The emaciated horse dropped dead in front of horrified visitors at Shenzhen Safari Park

According to media in China, the horse dropped dead while pulling a heavy carriage occupied by four tourists for the twelfth time that day.

The photos were taken by tourist Shi Lin, who said: ‘I was visiting the park and it was the first thing I saw, this horse dropping on the ground and falling over dead.

‘Its eyes and mouth were wide open and it looks really skinny and malnourished. It happened while it was trying to get up the slope, to be honest it looks too weak to coach let alone the driver and four passengers.’ 

The death occurred during the Golden Week holiday period at the wildlife park in southern China’s Guangdong Province, located north of Hong Kong.

Prices for the popular horse and carriage rides are doubled during public holidays and horses are forced to work more to meet demand.

Shenzhen Safari Park management denied that they are responsible, claiming the rides had been subcontracted to a third party who holds all responsibility for the horses’ welfare.

But zoo officials were unable to provide a copy of a signed contract or a name for the subcontractor when they were questioned by reporters.

A zoo worker told Chinese media: ‘Horses are like people. They can fall ill and suffer from diseases such as heart attacks and thrombosis.

‘Horses can live as long as 20 years and this one is about 15 years old.’ 

Park management attempted to deflect responsibility, claiming a subcontractor is to blame
