Kim Sears made it clear she's Team Murray all the way as she attended his latest Australian Open match - by choosing to wear a bright yellow blazer that colour coordinated with his kit.

The 25-year-old had a smile as sunny as her jacket as she took her seat to watch her boyfriend defeat Roger Federer in the semi-final in Melbourne.

She wore her blazer over a loose-fitting grey vest top with jeans and carried her favourite £1,100 Mulberry Bayswater handbag.

The designer accessory was much more expensive than her blazer - which is from High Street chain Topshop. The jacket was originally on sale for £65 but is currently reduced to the bargain price of £20 on their website. It's also available at full price in different shades including red and peach.

It isn't the first time this week Kim has championed
the British High Street. She was seen in an £85 blouse from Whistles at
one of Murray's opening matches. She then wore Whistles again to watch him in Wednesday's quarter final draw., donning a £150 weave print dress from the store.

Kim's look today was smarter than that of Federer's wife Miroslava Vavrinec, who wore a casual sports jacket to watch the action.

The Scot repeated his success in last year's Olympics by beating Wimbledon champ Federer, booking his place in another grand slam final against Novak Djokovic this weekend.

Murray played in this season's kit from his sponsor's Adidas - a black T-shirt with yellow sleeves which he teamed with a matching yellow sweatband.

Federer's sponsors, Nike, seemed equally keen for him to look the part, kitting him out in a grey T-Shirt with pink detailling along with colour coordinating pink trainers. He even wore a matching headband to complete the look.

Among the celebs also taking in the tennis battle were actor Kevin Spacey and cricketer Shane Warne.

Kim watched on with her boyfriend's coach, Ivan Lendl, and his mother, Judy, as Murray took the first set 6-4 but Federer fought back to take the second set 7-6 after a tie break.

But the Brit held his nerve to take the third set 6-3. However, Federer wasn't beaten yet, winning another tie break 7-6 to take the match to a thrilling fifth set.

Despite famously saying after his defeat at Wimbledon last year that he 'could cry like Federer but not play like him,' Murray did out play the Swiss in the last set, finally clinching victory 6-2.

Commenting on his hard fought win after the match, Murray said: 'It's always tough against Roger.  think the slams are where he plays his best tennis. When his back was against the wall at 6-5 he played some unbelievable tennis. He missed some shots at the start of the fifth and I just stuck in there.'

As for the meeting with Djokovic, who thrashed David Ferrer in last night's semi, he added: 'I didn't see much of his game although I heard about it. I heard he played very well. I will have to play my best tennis to win it.'
