As well as being a chart-topping singer, Tinie Tempah is without a doubt one of Britain's most stylish men.

So, it's hardly surprising that Tinie, who counts fashionista Cheryl Fernandez-Versini as one of his nearest and dearest, has been hand-picked to be The London Collections: Men ambassador.

The 26-year-old replaces Nick Grimshaw in the role, which sees him promoting all things men's fashion ahead of the London Fashion Week this month.

Tinie Tempah has designed his own bespoke suit as he's revealed as the ambassador of London Collections: Men - an event to celebrate the most stylish male fashion the UK has to offer

So enthusiastic is Tinie about his role that he's designed a bespoke three-piece suit made from the first-ever ‘London Tweed.’ 

The fashion icon and rapper has teamed up with the Museum of London and Savile Row tailor Norton & Son’s to design the  suit ahead of its debut at the capital’s leading men’s fashion event.

All eyes will be on Tinie and his new threads between the 9th and 12th of January when he’ll be watching UK fashion royalty display their AW15 collections. 

The musician proves his fashion know-how after choosing everything from the horseshoe waistcoat, to the tapered trousers and a slim-fit single-breasted jacket with a subtle flash of golden yellow lining.

The suit was apparently inspired by the capital’s most famous fictional tweed-wearing detective, Sherlock Holmes. 

The colour scheme is an urban grey with accents of blue and gold running through, and the suit has apparently been tailored to fit Tinie’s contemporary urban style. 

Curators have recorded the entire suit-making process from sketch to stitch and the suit will become part of the museum’s extensive fashion and textiles collection to help document historical and contemporary menswear in London today. 

All events on the schedule - including a show from Burberry Prorsum - showcase British fashion talent
