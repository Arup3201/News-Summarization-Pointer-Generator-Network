Parents of ill children are outraged after being told to buy a blow up bed from Argos if they wanted to stay in hospital with their child.

The frustrated parents are calling on hospital bosses to offer more beds for parents with sick children. 

The bed settees provided by Doncaster Royal Infirmary in South Yorkshire are only built for one person, so hospital staff said if more than one person wanted to stay, parents should make their own arrangements.

Debi Gregory said staff at Doncaster Royal Infirmary told her she could bring in a blow up bed so her sister could stay with her. The bed settees provided by the hospital are only built for one person

But Governors at the Doncaster and Bassetlaw hospital trust raised concerns over parents sleeping on the floor at the hospital's children's observation unit. 

At a recent governors meeting it was revealed staff at the hospital had advised parents to buy a blow-up bed from Argos because of the issue. 

Hospital chiefs said they didn't have the money to fund more than one bed for relatives staying on wards.

Some parents have suggested setting up a 'Friends of Doncaster Children's Hospital' group to raise funds. 

Speaking on Facebook, parent Debi Gregory said: 'I was there last week with my baby son and we were told we could bring a blow up bed in. 

'My sister stayed with me while my husband was home with our other two children and she slept on two waiting room chairs pushed together.'

Parent Briar Rose said: 'Parents should be given a proper bed.

'They need to be well rested to cope with the stress and worry over their sick child and to have the stamina that this takes.' 

Richard Parker, the trust's director of nursing, midwifery and quality, said: 'We always aim to provide the best environment for patients to receive treatment and care, and on the children's ward this means helping parents to stay with their child overnight, if they so wish.

'Space on the ward is prioritised for the care of the children. However, we do we offer a range of accommodation to parents, for example reclining chairs and beds on other wards.

Hospital bosses at Doncaster Royal Infirmary said there is not the provision to provide more than one camp bed for each child. Partner Governer Adele Mumby said: 'A lot of hospitals wouldn't even be able to allow parents to sleep on the ward - at least we have been able to provide something'

'We are also happy for parents to make their own arrangements should they choose, providing staff can easily access the child to provide treatment in the case of an emergency.'

Hospital Governor Adele Mumby said Doncaster and Bassetlaw hospitals provide an 'excellent service' and that staff try to do what they can to accommodate parents with an unwell youngster.

'I believe we've got an excellent facility overall, but unfortunately there isn't the provision to provide more than one camp bed for each child.'

She added: 'I completely sympathise with families if they have found it difficult, but at least we have been able to provide something.'

'A lot of hospitals wouldn't even be able to allow parents to sleep on the ward.'
