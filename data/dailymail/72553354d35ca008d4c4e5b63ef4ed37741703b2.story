A former member of Britain's Special Forces has been arrested on suspicion of masterminding a series of armed robberies in Spain and Majorca.

Andrew Martorall, 44, allegedly led two members of the Spanish navy and two private security guards in raids on homes and shopping centres.

The gang apparently used their knowledge of military tactics to steal from a Majorca shopping mall, taking £238,000 over three raids.

The gang are said to have stolen £238,000 from a shopping complex in Palma (pictured), the capital of holiday island Majorca

Two members of the Spanish navy, two private security guards and a former British Special Forces agent were arrested. The groups used their expertise to raid shopping centres in Palma for years

The robberies were planned using information provided by a security guard who worked at the centre.

Martorall was described by National 
Police in Madrid as 'an expert in arms and 
military tactics who had belonged to the Special Forces of the United 
Kingdom'.

It is not yet known which unit he served for. The gang was arrested in Barcelona yesterday following a three-year National Police operation.

The suspected members of the gang were identified following the theft of an assault riffle from a military base.

The group targeted the same shopping complex in Palma, the capital of Majorca between May 2009 and June 2010.

The suspects allegedly began their spree in May 2009 when they stole a truck from a military base and rammed it into the mall.

They allegedly stole from private homes on the island and are accused of a kidnapping.
