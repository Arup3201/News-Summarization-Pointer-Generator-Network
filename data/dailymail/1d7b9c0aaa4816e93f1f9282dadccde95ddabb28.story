When it comes to hitting the road, they do it together, bringing smiles wherever they travel.

Moki, a five-year-old Goldendoodle – a cross between a golden retriever and a standard poodle – sits behind his owner Brad Bakalar, from Reno, Nevada aboard his beloved Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

The pair have been getting a lot of attention on YouTube as the pair travel across the country, making Moki one of the most photographed dogs in America.

Moki has become something of an internet sensation, featured on YouTube as he rides on the back of Brad Bakelar's Harley

Brad and Moki often go for long drives in the country along with wife Marti who can be seen in the background

Brad picked up Moki as he was wandering the streets of Arizona. The pooch weighed just 16 pounds at the time

Moki seems to love just hopping onto Brad's Harley and hitching a ride whether its along country roads or along the Interstate

Me and my buddy: Moki has become something of an internet sensation

Trusted companion: Moki puts his paws around Brad as they stop at traffic lights 

In one of the more memorable moments, the video shows him riding down I-580 on the passenger seat of Brad's Harley.

The video went viral appearing on countless  sites. 

Moki appears to be well-loved by his owner which is a huge turnaround in fortunes for the pooch who was found abandoned and starving when he and the Bakelars found each other in Page, Arizona.

'About five years ago, I was helping some friends in a boat shop,' said Brad to the Reno Gazette-Journal. 

'It's a small town and they had a little animal rescue that they ran out of the shop. 

Some folks called and said there was a little dog wandering this apartment complex for two weeks and he was starving to death. 

Getting all the attention: Bra'ds wife Marti (right) now has to ride her own bike instead of riding pillion behind Brad - all thanks to Moki who takes up her old space!

Moki brings smiles wherever he goes and has been known to spark spontaneous, paparazzi-like photo ops

On more than one occasion – the most recent being Pinocchio's Ride for the Tatas breast cancer fundraiser in Virginia City – Bakelar and Moki have sat on the motorcycle getting the attention and raising money

Holding on! Unlike other celebrities, Moki will work for belly rubs, treats and, especially, motorcycle rides

The minute he got into the shop, he ran in, leaned against my leg and kind of adopted me. I called my wife and said, 'You'd better set another place for dinner because we've got a new family member.'

When he was first picked up, he looked nothing like how he does now. He was tso thin, his ribs were showing and his fur was dirty and matted, weighing just 16 pounds. Now he is closer to 70. 

His new found friend came to work with him, where Brad works as a mechanic. 

It became apparent that Moki enjoyed riding around.

'I would move boats around with the forklift and wherever I would go, he would go,' Brad said. 

'He just jumped on and started riding around with me. That segued into this little ATV 4-wheeler we had at the shop. He jumped on there with me.'

When Brad got his Harley out, Moki jumped on board. 

Like his owner, Moki wears eye protection while they ride and most of their trips are 150 miles or less at a time

One big happy family: Marti ended up having to get her own bike after Moki took her place on Brad's bike! 

Holding on: Moki clings to Brad as the pair cruise effortlessly down the Interstate

'He got excited and I said, 'Get on or get run over and he ran up my knee into the back seat and has pretty much been there ever since.'

The pair have been riding the roads together since 2009 and covered nearly 40,000 miles together.

Moki hops on board the Harley, straps on his eye protection and the duo hit the road.

Most trips are around 150 miles or less, after which the Goldendoodle wants feels ready to take a nap. 

Once thing is certain, wherever the pair travel, people always want to get their photo's taken with the duo. 

Over the summer, Brad found that Moki also enjoys riding on the back of a jet ski, sitting comfortably behind him once again.

Brad Bakelar said that it is all in good taste and has become something of a labor of love.

'It's something that he and I do because we like doing it,' he said.

'It's not something I'm trying to make money off of. I'm not going to turn him into Lassie. I don't want it to become something that I dread doing. It's fun that people notice and enjoy him.

In addition to the motorcycle, Moki apparently also enjoys riding on the back of of a jet ski, sitting comfortably behind his owner, Brad, who says the whole thing has now become a labor of love
