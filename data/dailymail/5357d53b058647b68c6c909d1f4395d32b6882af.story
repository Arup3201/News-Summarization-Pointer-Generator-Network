A security guard shot himself at the Swedish prime minister's official residence this afternoon while the politician's son was in the building, it has been reported.

Prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt was not in the building at the time of the shooting and his son is not thought to have been hurt in the incident.

Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported the victim died after shooting himself. Towe Hagg, spokeswoman for Stockholm Police partially confirmed the paper's information.

She said: ‘I can confirm that we have a deceased male.

Shooting: The security guard is thought to have shot himself at the Swedish prime minister's offical residence in Stockholm on Friday afternoon

Safe: Prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt was not in the building at the time of the shooting

'He died inside Sager Palace. There 
is nothing which indicated a crime but we are gathering information with
the help of investigators at the scene’

Markus
Friberg, a spokesman for Mr Reinfeldt, confirmed to The Associated 
Press that the prime minister was not in the building when the shooting 
happened.

Tabloid Aftonbladet said Mr Reinfeldt was visiting the paper's
office in Stockholm.

'I can say nothing happened to the prime minister. He was not harmed,' Stockholm police spokesman Lars Bystrom said.

'And it wasn't one of his bodyguards but some security guard. We do not suspect any crime.'

The incident occurred in the early afternoon at the Sagerska Palace, the waterfront home and office of the prime minister.

The building is protected by security guards working for private company, Svensk Bevakningstjanst.

Company spokeswoman Maria Fernsund confirmed that the victim was an employee of the company but declined to give other details.

The prime minister also has bodyguards from the Swedish Security Service. They were not affected by the incident, said Sirpa Franzen, a spokeswoman for the agency.

'At present there is no indication that the incident has any link to the Parliament or government,' she said. 

Unhurt: Mr Reinfeldt's son was at Sager Palace when the security guard died but is not thought to have been hurt in the incident

Remote: Swedish Police said the man was not one of Mr Reinfeldt's bodyguards and that they were not treating the death as suspicious

The protection of Sweden's top politicians was stepped up after the 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme and the deadly stabbing of Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in 2003. Both were without bodyguards when they were killed.

Sweden takes pride in having an open society and government buildings are relatively easy to access. Anyone can walk up to the entrance to the prime minister's residence.
