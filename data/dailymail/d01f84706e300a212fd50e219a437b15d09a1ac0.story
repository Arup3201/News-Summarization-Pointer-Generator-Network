Today show host Karl Stefanovic has admitted to smacking his children as he weighed in on a fiery debate on discipline after a mother was charged over slapping her four-year-old son in the face.

Police charged the 34-year-old woman with assault on January 9 after a member of the public reported seeing the alleged incident at a shopping centre in Perth.

The woman's husband and father of the boy said it happened after the child went into a meltdown and she was forced to discipline him for biting into an apple they hadn't paid for.

Today show host Karl Stefanovic has admitted to smacking his children as he weighed in on a fiery debate on discipline after a mother was charged over slapping her four-year-old son in the face

The incident caused a heated debate on Nine's Today show on Wednesday with Karl Stefanovic, Mornings host David Campbell and newsreader Sylvia Jeffreys passionately arguing their points.

When pressed during the Grill segment, Stefanovic admitted to smacking his children in the past as a form of discipline. 

'I have. I was smacked as a kid,' he said. 

But Campbell argued the 'violence' needed to stop.

'I'm huge compared to (my son), I'm not going to hit my children. They're too small and too fragile,' he said.

'I don't like it. I'm one of on those parents that thinks the cycle needs to break.'

While Sylvia Jeffreys admitted her opinion on smacking was still forming because she didn't have any children of her own, she said she was sympathetic to the situation the mother had found herself in.

'Every parent has certain moments in life where everything falls apart and that's the only option you can take at that moment,' she said.

'I'd like to think that eventually I won't (smack my children), but I just don't know what circumstances I will find myself in. 

'I was smacked as a child and I can certainly say without question that I don't lean towards violent tendencies as an adult, I don't believe that violence is an answer for anything.'

The incident in Perth was sparked when the four-year-old boy took a bite out of an apple in the supermarket and put it back. 

The mother then paid for the apple but wouldn't give it back to her son. He then supposedly had a temper tantrum and the mother smacked him.

'My wife does have arthritis, so her discipline below the head has been laughed at in the past... She's slapped my son to the side of the face, which is probably uncalled for, but it was done,' the boy's father told 6PR radio on Monday. 

'He was rebelling a bit so she's clipped him on the side of the face, not necessarily aiming for that.' 

The man said officers stopped his wife in the car park to inspect their three children and later arrested her at the family home, taking her away in a police van.

Sylvia admitted that she was smacked as a child, but in no way had it given her violent tendencies as an adult

CCTV footage from the shopping centre has been handed to police as they continue to investigate. 

The father of the boy has slammed police for terrifying his children. 

He said there was no history of abuse against the children and their son was not injured.

'They were all bruise free, not a mark on them,' he said.

'They were mortified at the fact that their mum was in trouble, who was also broken down in tears.' 

The mother is due to appear in court on March 12.

It comes after a Queensland political candidate was forced to withdraw from the state election after CCTV footage emerged of him smacking his child across the head in a busy cafe.

Independent candidate Jason Deller was caught on camera pouring a jug of cold water over his baby son before slapping another child in the head at Buddina last month.
