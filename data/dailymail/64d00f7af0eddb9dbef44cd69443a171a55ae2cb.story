John Terry continued to make the most of his summer holidays as he enjoyed a day playing golf at The Wisley course with his children.

The Chelsea captain posted videos on Instagram of himself and his eight-year-old twin children, Summer and Georgie, teeing off on different holes of the course in north-west Surrey.

And his youngsters seem to have inherited his knack for the great game as all of them struck near-perfect drives from the tee box.

Terry was left out of Roy Hodgson's England squad for the World Cup following his international retirement in September 2012.

The 33-year-old centre back scored six goals in 78 international appearances.

He
 played exceptionally well during his 47 matches for Chelsea last 
season, scoring twice, leading to calls for him to return to the 
international fold.

The
 Wisley is regarded as one of the best golf courses in the world and 
regularly features in lists of the top-100 places to play in the world.

Sun-soaked: While England were being knocked out of the World Cup, Terry was on holiday with wife Toni

Missed: Terry played 78 times in an England shirt and would have been an asset again if available for Brazil

Still the one: Terry was the best English centre back in the Premier League last season
