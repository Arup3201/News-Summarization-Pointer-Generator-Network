Why spend hundreds of dollars on a boring paint job for your car when you can cover it in the actual money instead? These were the bizarre thoughts of an Indiana couple who have given their vintage Cadillac the ultimate bling makeover.

When Larry and Theresa Thompson  saw an advert for a 1949 Cadillac Series 62 back in 1999, they decided it couldn't hurt to take a look.

They got there to find it covered with layers of snow, and once they had scraped it away, saw that the paintwork was dull, and the colour of an old penny.

Rich history: Larry and Theresa Thompson, from Fort Wayne, Indiana, bought a classic Cadillac in 1999, and set about covering every inch of paintwork with more than 38,000 one cent coins

Bling: The car, appropriately named Penny, underwent a real money makeover, and weighs 14 stone more than it did when the couple discovered it covered with snow 15 years ago

This gave them an idea - they would buy the car and cover every inch of it with one cent coins. Six weeks later, 'Penny' was born.

The unique 'paint job', consisting of 38,295 individual coins, is worth exactly $382.95 - roughly the same as it would cost to have it spray painted.

Mrs Thompson, 48, from Fort Wayne, said: 'Once we had brushed the snow off and discovered she was already the colour of an old penny, we decided it was fate.

Teamwork: Friends, family and even strangers pitched in to help with the bizarre project, which took six weeks

Then and now: Penny as she was (left) and how she looks today, covered with coins (right)

'We started with our jar of pennies but blew through those pretty quickly.

'Pennies came from friends, family, and even strangers who just wanted to be a part of the project.

'In the 15 years we've owned Penny we've had great fun with her and created some wonderful memories.'

Mrs Thompson and her 51-year-old husband 'minted up' the car with the help of their two children. Ben, 25, and Taylor, 22, were ten and seven at the time, and Penny has been with them as they have gone through school and become adults.

The family still drive the car at weekends and during the summer, and they have also displayed it at shows

Mrs Thompson had to order coins from the U.S. mint, as banks only stock around $12 worth of cents at a time

Every coin was stuck on by hand, and they add a whopping 14 stone to the car's weight, though it still gets driven at weekends and during the summer, and has been displayed at multiple shows.

As banks only store around $12 worth of pennies at any given time, Theresa needed to specially order coins from the U.S. mint.

Mrs Thompson's one regret is that she never got to show Penny's original owner what her family had done with the car.

'I like to think we helped to fulfil her destiny - I'd love to know how the original owner feels about what we did with her,' she said.

'I tried locating him but discovered he'd passed away shortly before we purchased her.

'Not long ago we crossed paths with one of his grandsons at a car show, who said his grandfather would have loved the car.'
