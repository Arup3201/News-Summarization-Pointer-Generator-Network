Signal: David Cameron told MPs he could take action in Iraq and inform the House of Commons afterwards

David Cameron last night opened the door to joining US air strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq without Parliament’s prior approval.

The Prime Minister gave his strongest signal yet that he is considering supporting Washington’s attempt to build a coalition to expand air assaults on the jihadists.

He also told MPs Britain would ‘look very favourably’ on a request for help from Kurdish forces fighting extremists in Iraq, so they are ‘properly armed and equipped’.

Downing Street has been wary about joining military strikes following Mr Cameron’s humiliating Commons defeat last year when he sought support for action in Syria.

But the Prime Minister suggested yesterday he could order action against jihadists without MPs’ approval in advance.

‘If there was a direct threat to British national interests, or if… we had to act very rapidly to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, the British Government must reserve the right to act immediately and inform the House of Commons afterwards,’ he said.

Officials insisted no decisions had been made. Mr Cameron said this week’s summit of Nato leaders in Wales will include a ‘review of the effectiveness of the international response so far’ and a discussion of ‘what more we should do to help the region’.

‘Britain will continue to consider what further role is in our national interests, including any further diplomatic, humanitarian or indeed military measures we might take,’ he said.

‘We support American air strikes. I do not think that we should rule anything out. We should act… to promote the British national interest and to help keep our people safe. We should consider everything in the light of that.’

Intelligence chiefs believe at least 500 people have travelled from the UK to fight in the region, with 700 from France, 400 from Germany and hundreds from countries including the US, Canada, Austria, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia. 

The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre last week increased its assessment of the threat of an attack in the UK from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’.

Mr Cameron told MPs the world was ‘shocked and sickened by the barbarism’ seen in Iraq this summer, including the slaughter of Muslims by Muslims, persecution of religious minorities, enslavement and rape of women, and the beheading of US journalist James Foley by an apparently British terrorist.

US president Barack Obama said last month that America was seeking to build a coalition to ‘take the fight to these barbaric terrorists’.

Plans? The Prime Minister said he would look 'very favourably' on arming Kurdish forces to fight the IS

But a ComRes survey for The Independent today finds only 35 per cent of people believe the UK should join US air strikes, while 50 per cent disagree and 15 per cent say they ‘don’t know’.

Former Labour minister Peter Hain said he backed air strikes to ‘stop [IS’s] genocidal attacks in the region’.

He also said Britain should support the Kurds ‘in providing the equipment they need’.

Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said IS was a ‘substantial threat to the continued integrity of Iraq’ and that US air strikes have been ‘successful in halting its further advance’.

He added: ‘Would it not be better for the Royal Air Force to join in that measure?’

Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart said: ‘Tragically, the only way to defeat people who are determined to carry out appalling acts, despite reason, politics, economic sanctions or whatever, is to defeat them on the battlefield.’
