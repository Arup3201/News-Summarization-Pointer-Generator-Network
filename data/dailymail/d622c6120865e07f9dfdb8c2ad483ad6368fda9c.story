Small project: John Hay, 67, has decked out the former British Telecom box with First World War memorabilia in Barningham, County Durham

A retired marketing director has converted a rare green telephone box into what could be the world’s smallest war museum.

John Hay, 67, has decked out the former British Telecom box with First World War memorabilia to create a miniature museum in County Durham.

The phone box in Barningham has been renamed the Listening Post and is filled with newspapers and collectables from 1914.

It contains historic items including newspaper front pages published between June and December of that year, as well as a replica of a brass tin which was given to every soldier by Princess Mary as a Christmas present in 1914.

The phone box is also filled with a tin helmet, maps of some of the early battles and a copy of the village flyer, which has been disguised as the trench magazine the Wipers Times. Sandbags, toy rats and bully beef tins - all familiar sights in the trenches - have also been included.

Mr Hay - a Barnington resident since 1987, who lives in a four-bedroom semi-detached house with his wife Sheila, 67 - decided to create the small exhibition after painting a portrait of his grandfather in his First World War uniform.

He said: ‘I decided to create the miniature museum after I finished the portrait of my late grandfather from 1914 when he was just off to war. I hung the portrait in the phone box and my wife said to me why don’t you keep going.

'So I decorated it with poppies and converted the telephone box into a World War One display. My wife Sheila did a lot of the research.

'She researched how little bears which were tucked into soldiers’ top pockets as a keepsake and how women were known as "canaries" as they turned yellow due to prolonged exposure to sulphuric acid through their work making shells in the munitions factories.

‘We put the research inside the phone 
box so other people could learn about it. I made the sand bags myself 
and I managed to get a hold of a brass tin like the one sent to the 
troops by Princess Mary in 1914.

‘Barnington
 is a small village, yet there is 15 men on the war memorial who died in
 the war. I have put a list of their names inside the phone box.

‘When
 people see the display it makes them think a bit more about the 
sacrifice these soldiers made. A lot of people in the village like it. 
They say, “Well done, it is a good display”, and it does make them 
think. It means a lot to me.’

The green phone box was sold by BT to Barningham Parish Council in 2012 for just £1.

Changes: Mr Hay, a member of the parish council, was asked to transform the phone box, which originally contained a carpet, a beer glass and a lot of spiders, two years ago

Remembered: Mr Hay said people who look at the museum 'think a bit more about the sacrifice soldiers made'

Packed: The phonebox is filled with a tin helmet, maps of some of the early battles and a copy of the village flyer, which has been disguised as the trench magazine the Wipers Times

He decided to bring a bit of eccentricity to his village’s green by filling it full of paintings.

Mr Hay said: ‘I retired in 2012 when I was 65 and I was given the opportunity to transform the phone box. I turned it into an art gallery and would change the display every three months.

'At Christmas time I put a big tree in there. People who pass through the village stop and have a look what is inside the phone box.

‘I leave everything inside so they can pop by and open the door, have a look then close it again. We do not have any funding so it is interesting to see what is around and what I can make up.’
