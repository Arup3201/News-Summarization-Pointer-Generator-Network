The Islamic State recording showing two Japanese men held hostage by militants may have been filmed in separate locations before being combined into a single video, experts claim.

Inconsistencies with the shadows of Haruna Yukawa, fellow captive Kenji Goto and the masked killer known as Jihadi John suggest images of the hostages were recorded separately and then added together for greater effect.

Other tell-tale signs include the jumpsuits worn by the two men - they are slightly different shades of orange and don't flutter in the wind at the same time.

ISIS is well known for its video and imaging production abilities with all propaganda videos it releases having been carefully manufactured and edited.

Mr Goto and fellow Japanese national Haruma Yukawa appeared in the video, released earlier this week, in which they were threatened with death unless $200million was paid within 72 hours.

In the video, Mr Yukawa and Mr Goto sit kneeling on either side of Jihadi John.

But the shadows of the militant, Mr Goto and Mr Yukawa lean in different directions. And perhaps most tellingly, the shadows of the hostages' heads are cast down onto opposite sides of their necks.

Both examples indicate there may have been different light sources used for filming the men separately, then adding them together for a more intimidating video.

Tsuyoshi Moriyama, an associate professor at Tokyo Polytechnic University and image technology expert, said: 'It's possible that video images taken at different times were combined.

'A very high level of knowledge and skill would be necessary to make such a composite video,' the Washington Post reported, according to Stuff.

Shiego Mori-shima, a Waseda University Professor on information-communication engineering, added it was possible that the images were recorded in different places after noting the jumpsuits were different shades of orange and didn't flutter in the wind at the same time.

Meanwhile, the mother of Mr Goto has pleaded for his life as the deadline to pay his ransom passed overnight and militants warned the 'countdown has begun'.

An ISIS posting appeared online today showing a clock counting down to zero along with gruesome images of other hostages who have been beheaded by ISIS.

Mr Goto's mother Junko Ishido choked back tears while telling a packed news conference that her son was not an enemy of the people of Islamic faith and if she could, she would offer her own life to ensure his safe release.

The Japanese government said it was in an 'extremely severe
situation' while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said saving the men's lives is
paramount but that Japan will not bow to terrorism.

The Japanese government considered the deadline to be 5:50am today.

'My son Kenji is not an enemy of the people of the Islamic
faith. I can only pray as a mother for his release,' Mrs Ishido said. 'If I could offer my life I would plead that my son
be released, it would be a small sacrifice on my part.

'He only went to rescue his friend. He has always looked out
for weaker people, he was always helping weaker children than
him,' she added.

She said she was astonished to learn from her daughter-in-law that she had a newborn baby, and said the child needed his father.

Abe has ordered his government to make every effort to
secure their safe release, setting off a flurry of activity
among Japanese diplomats.

The captor in the video, which resembles those showing
previous Islamic State captives who were beheaded, says the ransom demand matches the $200 million in aid that Abe pledged to help countries
fighting Islamist militants.

Abe made the pledge during a multi-nation visit to the
Middle East earlier this week. Islamic State militants have
seized large areas of Iraq and Syria, and beheaded several
Western captives.

Japan has stressed that its donation is for humanitarian
aid, such as helping refugees, and insisted that it will not bow
to terrorist threats.

'The government is continuing to work in unison to gather
information and make every efforts for their release,' Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.
'We are in an extremely severe situation,' Suga said.

Asked if Tokyo would pay the ransom, he said: 'There is no
change to our stance that we will not give in to terrorism and
will contribute to the international response to terrorism. As
we make utmost efforts for their swift release, we are
negotiating through all available channels.'

Japanese officials have declined to say if they would pay
any ransom, a move that would put Tokyo at odds with close ally
the United States.

Prior to the video's release, Japanese diplomats had told
the families of the two captives that the government would not
pay ransom, sources familiar with the matter said.

Tokyo's most prominent mosque, the Tokyo Camii and Turkish
Culture Center, posted a statement calling for the prompt
release of the hostages.

It said ISIS's actions are 'totally against Islam
and have a serious impact on Muslim communities all over the
world and put Muslims in a precarious position'.

Abe's handling of the hostage crisis - he must appear firm
but not callous - will be a big test for the 60-year-old, but he
appears to have few options.

Yukawa, aged around 42 and who dreamed of becoming a
military contractor, was captured in August outside the Syrian
city of Aleppo.

help Yukawa.

'He left a very young baby and left his family and I asked
his wife why he made this decision and she said he had to do
everything in his power to save his friend and acquaintance and
that it was very important to him,' said his mother.

Meanwhile, Japan's government considered whether it had the legal basis for a military strike on ISIS militants and concluded it did not, as officials scrambled to seek the release of its two nationals.

Japan's pacifist constitution bans its troops from fighting overseas. However, Mr Abe is trying to ease curbs on exercising the right of collective self-defence, or militarily aiding an ally under attack, in a reinterpretation of the constitution that must now be passed into law.

Prayers have been offered at Tokyo's largest mosque as the status of the men remains unclear.

Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga was asked about the militants' claim that the 'countdown' had begun and said Japan was analysing it.

'The situation remains severe, but we are doing everything we can to win the release of the two Japanese hostages,' Mr Suga said.

He added Japan is using every channel it can find, including local tribal chiefs, to try to reach the captors.
