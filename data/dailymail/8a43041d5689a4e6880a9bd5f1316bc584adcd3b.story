Rescuers who plucked a teenage hiker from a steep, rocky canyon wall on Thursday said she was exhausted, had trouble breathing and likely could not have survived much longer than another day in the rugged southern California wilderness.

Kyndall Jack, 18, was rescued from a near-vertical wall in Falls Canyon in Cleveland National Forest, five days after she got lost on a day hike with a friend.

'She was kind of clinging to the ledge on the cliff side, kind of going in and out of consciousness,' said Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Jim Moss, a paramedic who treated her.

Drama in the wild: Kyndall Jack, 18, is airlifted to safety by Los Angeles County Search and Rescue after being missing for five days in rugged country near Rancho Santa Margarita, California

Rescued: Miss Jack is being treated in hospital and her family have been notified that she is safe

'We climbed up to her and could see she was in a lot of pain, obviously completely dehydrated and very weak.

'She wouldn't have made it much longer. She's really lucky.'

Barely able to move, Jack had managed
to scream on and off for 90 minutes, shouting at times, 'I'm here, I'm 
here,' as rescuers moved toward her.

It was her screams that brought 
searchers to her hours after they found her hiking companion, 
19-year-old Nicolas Cendoya on Wednesday night, said Orange County 
sheriff's Lt. Jason Park.

'We started to close in. We heard the
voice from all our ground crews and surrounded it and made contact with
her,' he said. 'It was very difficult to extract her.'

Risky adventure: Kyndall Jack's father said his daughter called him Sunday to say that she is going on a hike, which was unusual for her

A reserve deputy aiding the effort 
suffered a head injury when he fell 60 feet down the canyon.

He was also
flown to a hospital. His name was not released and his condition was 
not immediately known.

After rescuers found Jack they strapped her into a harness and lifted her into a helicopter that took her to hospital.

She and Cendoya had driven to the 
area on Easter Sunday for what was supposed to be a short, easy day hike
through a picturesque canyon to a waterfall. The area is part of the 
rugged forest that sprawls across 720 miles of Southern California.

Before his cellphone's battery died, 
Cendoya was able to make a 911 call Sunday telling authorities the 
couple had gotten lost and were in distress.

'He was panting and said, ''We're out
of water.'' You could hear Kyndall in the background," said Orange 
County fire Capt. Jon Muir.

'He said, ''I think we're about a 
mile or two from the car,'' and he was right about the distance but in 
totally the wrong direction.'

Cendoya was found on Wednesday night 
in shorts and a shirt but missing his shoes. He was flown to Mission 
Hospital in Mission Viejo, where doctors said he was being treated for 
severe dehydration, scratches and bruises. He was expected to remain for
several days.Â 

Park said Cendoya was 'extremely 
confused and disoriented', when he was found less than a mile from the 
pair's car, giving an added urgency to the effort to find his friend.

Jack was found in similar condition, dressed in a pair of dirty athletic shorts, a hoodie and socks, having also lost her shoes.

Her rescuers said she couldn't 
remember what day it was or even that she had gone hiking. She had no 
idea how she had gotten on to the steep, rocky canyon outcropping where 
they found her.

She was suffering from low blood pressure, shortness of breath and had pain in both legs and one hand.

Despite that, she suffered no major 
internal injuries and was listed in good condition at the University of 
California, Irvine, Medical Center, said hospital spokesman John Murray.

Like Cendoya, she was being treated for dehydration and was expected to be hospitalized for several days.

At Mission Hospital, Dr. Michael 
Ritter told reporters Cendoya said he survived by taking shelter at 
night in heavy brush and passing his days by praying.

'He's got a lot of faith in the Lord,
which I think will help him to work his way through this,' Ritter said 
shortly before Miss Jack was located.

Cendoya told doctors he and Jack became separated sometime on Sunday night.

He was found on a steep hill less 
than a mile from where the pair had left their car, but the brush was so
thick that a person wouldn't be able to see someone standing as close 
as five feet away, Park said. Miss Jack was found nearby.

The area is just 500 feet from a dirt
road that is fairly heavily traveled, but Park said Cendoya was so 
disoriented he likely wasn't aware of that.

'He was in an area near where people were calling his name and he didn't even know it,' Park said.

Brush in the area was so dense that 
even after he was found, a helicopter dispatched to rescue him had 
trouble keeping track of where he was. Two volunteer searchers got lost 
themselves and had to be flown out on Wednesday afternoon.

Cendoya says on his Facebook page 
that he's a 2011 graduate of Orange County's Costa Mesa High School and a
student at Orange Coast College. A number of photos show the 
athletic-looking young man working out and lifting weights.

He and Miss Jack are believed to have
gotten lost near near Holy Jim Trail, a tree-lined dirt path along a 
creek that leads to the waterfall.

The path is popular with day hikers, 
including families with children, and is not considered particularly 
difficult. Park warned, however, that it's very easy to get lost in the 
heavy brush and hikers who venture in should be prepared with plenty of 
food, water and proper clothing.

The area is in a section of forest in 
the Santa Ana Mountains that lie along the border of Orange and 
Riverside counties southeast of Los Angeles. The trail ranges in 
elevation from about 2,000 feet to about 4,000 feet.

Officials said Miss Jack's family was quickly notified that she had been found.

'They cried. They hugged us. They thanked us immensely,' Capt John Muir of the Orange County Fire Authority said.

Her father Russ Jack told the LA Times that Cendoya said he had communicated with Kyndall even after they were separated.

'Nicholas obviously was disoriented 
because of dehydration... he thought that Kyndall had already been 
rescued,' he said. 'He told us, "I haven't seen her for a day. I think 
she's already been rescued."

Authorities
ramped up the search for Kyndall today after finding Cendoya gave them 
renewed hope that both teens will be found alive.

Rough terrain: Officials believe the two teens 
took a detour and got off the Cleveland National Forest's popular Holy Jim Trail, a tree-lined dirt path along a creek that 
leads to a waterfall and is popular with day hikers
