Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell has revealed that motherhood saved her from depression when her ballet career ended

Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell has revealed that when her ballet career ended it was motherhood that saved her from plunging into depression.

Miss Bussell, 43, principal ballerina with the Royal Ballet, admitted she felt lost after the curtain came down for the final time in 2007 after 20 years on the stage.

She said: ‘I realised that was my last dance. There was a massive comedown.’

After her last show at Covent Garden, Miss Bussell and her husband Angus took daughters, Phoebe, now 11, and Zoe, eight, to live in Sydney. Speaking at the Bath Literature Festival, she admitted she had to pick herself up.

She said: ‘I wouldn’t say I got depressed, but I got low. I was very fortunate to have two children. All of a sudden all of my attention turned on them. I think they were like, “woah!”.’

Miss Bussell returned to the spotlight last year when she replaced singer Alesha Dixon on the Strictly judging panel.

Married to banker Angus Forbes, the couple have two daughters Phoebe, and Zoe.

She retired from the Royal Ballet aged 38. Providing an insight into her previous role she revealed she tried but failed to be a diva.

Miss Bussell said: ‘I was very desperate to try and be the diva but it never happened – there were times where I would think I’m going to stand up for myself and I’m going to make them think this but it didn’t happen very often. There were times when people would walk all over me.’

And she admitted the world of ballet is a sexist one with men also getting paid more.

Miss Bussell said: ‘I found ballet very sexist, I think people think of ballet as being women-orientated because choreographers write pieces around their female lead and often it is the female people come to see, but it is based around men. You can’t do most things without men, take lifts for example.

‘We don’t get paid much and it is disheartening to know that the man always gets more money. But any art is never going to make money, that is why so many companies are struggling now. And the guest performers always cost more.’
