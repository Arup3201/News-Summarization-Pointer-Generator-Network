Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Portugal’s penultimate warm-up game ahead of the World Cup as he continues to struggle for fitness.

The Portuguese Football Federation confirmed Ronaldo has been ruled out of the clash against Mexico in Foxborough, Massachusetts on Saturday, along with defender Pepe and midfielder Raul Meireles.

The Real Madrid forward has been struggling with tendinosis in his knee and a muscle injury in his left thigh since the end of the domestic campaign and there are serious fears he may miss Portugal’s opening game of the World Cup against Germany on June 16.

Raising the bar: Ronaldo still has a little way to go before confirming his fitness for the finals

‘The situation is evolving and our expectations are evolving constantly,’ Portugal boss Paulo Bento told reporters in Foxborough, when asked when the 29-year-old would be fit.

‘When he’s ready to play is a decision that will be made just like any other player, regardless of who it is. As soon as he is ready to train, we will make that announcement.

‘We have to prepare for Germany regardless. The decision of if he will play and when is up to me, the player and the doctors. Ronaldo is not the only good player we have.’

Portugal will play their final warm-up game on Tuesday against Republic of Ireland before flying from the United States to Brazil.

Despite his injuries, Ronaldo has spoken of his desire to win the World Cup with his national side.

And while the national team captain admits Portugal are not favourites for the World Cup – they have been drawn in a group with Germany, Ghana and the United States – he said he would like to win a title with the national team ‘one day’.

‘We aren’t favourites but we will try to perform our best as always. We know we have a difficult group stage,’ he told sportlobster.com.

‘In my opinion, we have the strongest group of the World Cup, but we should take it one step at a time.

‘We have an important opener against Germany, before we face Ghana and finally the United States. Our goal is obviously to pass the group stage and then we’ll see.

‘It fills me with pride, satisfaction, pleasure and honour to represent and captain the Portuguese national team but it is also a big responsibility.

‘I hope I win a title with the national team one day.'
