Nick Clegg insisted yesterday his party was 'here to stay' as he predicted the Liberal Democrats would defy the odds to serve a second term in government.

Despite consistently dismal poll ratings, the Lib Dem leader claimed it would win more seats than forecast and could still hold office with fewer MPs.

Attacking his Conservative coalition partners, he compared David Cameron to 'Nigel Farage in a white tie' and declared: 'Cows moo, dogs bark – and Tories cut. It's in their DNA.'

Mr Clegg claims his party could stop a 'rag-tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the Scottish National Party from holding the balance of power after the election on May 7

Mr Clegg also criticised Labour, despite making it clear he could foresee a coalition with either of the major parties. But he ruled out a formal coalition deal involving the SNP or Ukip.

He went so far as to claim that only his party could stop a 'rag-tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the Scottish National Party from holding the balance of power after the election on May 7.

The latest polls have consistently put the Lib Dems on just 7 per cent, with experts predicting they will lose at least half the 57 seats they won at the last election. But, bizarrely, Mr Clegg compared their hopes for the future to last November's landing of the Rosetta space probe on the surface of a comet.

'What an audacious, optimistic thing to have ever dreamt of attempting,' he said. 

Speaking at the party's spring conference in Liverpool, he added: 'I want us to take just a little bit of the spirit of that audacious project and to think big.'

Mr Clegg, who appeared to have matched his pink tie with the bubblegum-pink dress worn by his wife Miriam, watching from the front row, said his party would 'defy the odds and win this May'. 

He added: 'I have a message for all those who are writing us off again: The Liberal Democrats are here to stay. I've heard the predictions, I've seen the polls. But let me tell you this: We will do so much better than anyone thinks.'

However, his upbeat speech was overshadowed by an attack from Left-winger Tim Farron, who is thought to want his job.

Mr Farron, the Lib Dems' former president, said a second coalition with the Tories would tarnish the party's reputation 'over the next generation'.

He said he would give the party just two out of ten for its handling of coalition government.

Former leader Paddy Ashdown was unable to suppress a yawn as he watched Mr Clegg deliver his speech 

But former leader Paddy Ashdown said yesterday that Mr Farron should keep his ambitions in check. Lord Ashdown, who struggled to stifle a yawn during the conference, said of Mr Farron: 'I think his well-known ambitions would be better served with a little more patience and a little more judgment.

'Tim is a very able guy but judgment is not his strong suit.'

Lib Dem insiders firmly believe the party could be back in ministerial posts even if they emerge with as few as 30 seats on May 8.

They expect the Tories to emerge as the largest party, and hope they will be within 30 seats of a majority – 326 seats – so the Lib Dems can prop them up.

Mr Clegg's 46-year-old wife – a partner at a US law firm – does not get on stage to embrace her husband as other political wives do after their speeches. Yesterday, it was Mr Clegg who came down the steps – as at previous conferences – and hugged her before they left to cheers from the party faithful.
