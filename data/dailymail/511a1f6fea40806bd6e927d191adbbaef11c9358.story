Making waves: MP Penny Mordaunt on Splash! spoke about her compelling life story but omitted her failed marriage

When Tory MP Penny Mordaunt appeared in a primetime ITV diving show, the publicity blitz covered almost every aspect of her compelling life story. 

But for the woman once voted ‘Britain’s sexiest MP’ one topic was kept strictly off-limits – her short-lived marriage.

The 40-year-old MP for Portsmouth North has told friends she was so bruised by the experience that it has put her off ever marrying again.

Her wedding to Paul Murray, whom she met while they were both students at Reading University, is omitted from her entries in Who’s Who and Debrett’s.

One Westminster database even lists, under ‘number of marriages or civil partnerships’, the figure zero.

Ms Mordaunt, an aide to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and a Royal Navy reservist, has attracted scores of admirers – and raised her political profile – since her appearance on Splash!, in which celebrities are trained to dive by Olympic medallist Tom Daley.

She was voted off last weekend’s show following an inglorious belly flop into the pool.

During interviews to publicise the show, Ms Mordaunt revealed her difficult early years growing up in Portsmouth as the daughter of a paratrooper-turned-teacher.

Her mother died of breast cancer when she was 15 – the same year her father was also diagnosed with cancer – turning her into a ‘child carer’.

She took a job as a magician’s assistant to fund her way through college, which involved her being ‘sawn in half’.

She also told of her ‘life-changing’ year working in Romanian orphanages, before going to university  to study philosophy, and that she has a gay twin brother.

Revealed: Her marriage certificate to Paul Murray in 1999 when they were both 26. She told friends the experience left her so bruised she never wants to marry again

The only mention of her personal life was that she lives with her partner, Ian Lyon, a classical singer, Burmese cat breeder and director of an IT company, in Portsmouth.

They have eight cats, but no children.

However, a marriage certificate shows that she wed Mr Murray, the son of retired Lieut Col Leonard Murray, in July 1999, when they were both 26.

Mr Murray was listed as an ‘assistant hall manager’ while Ms Mordaunt, who was then starting a career in public relations, was described as a ‘press officer’.

One friend said: ‘The marriage is completely off-limits, a no-go zone. It went wrong quite quickly, and she says it has put her off for life.’

The Mail on Sunday can also reveal that Ms Mordaunt helped to secure the acquittal of one of her university lecturers after he was falsely accused of indecently assaulting two students.

John Cottingham, now the emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Reading University, had been accused of trying to seduce the pair by discussing bondage and the work of the Marquis de Sade during a garden party.

He walked free from court after a 1997 trial in which Ms Mordaunt, then 24, said she had ‘no hesitation’ in coming forward to support Professor Cottingham.

She said she had attended a conference at Oxford on her own at which the professor was also present – without incident – and had ‘never felt threatened’ in his presence.

Yesterday, a spokesman for Ms Mordaunt said she was not available for comment.
