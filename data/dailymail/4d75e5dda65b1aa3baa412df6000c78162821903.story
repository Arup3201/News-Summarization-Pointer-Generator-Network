This is the face of the vandal caught on camera urinating on a war memorial which honours those who died fighting for this country.

David Skinner is today behind bars after a judge sentenced him to five years in prison for robbery.

On the same day that he relieved himself against the war memorial in Margate, Kent, the 47-year-old was caught stealing £170 from a flat in Cliftonville, in the town.

Caught in the act: David Skinner, 47, was photographed urinating on the war memorial in Margate, Kent

Skinner was caught on camera as he showed little regard for the hundreds of names of soldiers from the area killed in conflicts since the First World War.

Skinner was fined £100 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge when he appeared before Medway Magistrates' Court on February 19.

He admitted outraging the public decency.

But the 47-year-old was taken into custody almost immediately after his first court appearance as police officers charged him with robbery.

He appeared at Canterbury Crown Court on March 18, where he pleaded guilty and a judge sentenced him to 64 months in prison and fined him £120.

A spokesman for Kent Police said Skinner is set to reappear in court on May 7 to face a charge of criminal damage.

One
 of the names inscribed into the part of the memorial where Skinner urinated is Marine Engineering Mechanic Alistair R. Leighton who died
 aged 19 during the Falklands war when HMS Ardent sank in 1982 after 
being bombed by the Argentinians' A-4 Skyhawk aircraft.

A number of civilians who died in the local area during World War II are also named on the memorial.

The court case took place as the country prepares to mark 100 years since the start of World War I later this year, sparking outrage.

Pamela
 Pople, chair of the Margate Civic Society said: 'We are quite appalled 
really - it’s just lack of respect. People laid down their lives and 
served their country – we are disappointed and disgusted.'

‘I
 think the public opinion would be very strong on this and people would 
be equally appalled. I was sent this photo, but I haven’t yet heard 
about the identity of this person. 

Speaking at the time a Royal British Legion spokesman said: 'The Legion is saddened to hear of this senseless incident.

'War memorials and graves honour the 
memory of the British Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice 
and those who defend the freedom we enjoy.'

Honoured: The war memorial in Trinity Square in Margate, Kent, which David Skinner urinated on

Colonel
 Tim Collins, a former officer from the Royal Irish Regiment, said: 'The
 value and respect for our nation's servicemen has diminished. 
Unfortunately you can't legislate for idiots.'

Student Philip Laing, 19, avoided a jail sentence in 2009 after urinating on a war memorial during a mass student bar crawl.

District Judge Anthony Browne, sitting at Sheffield Magistrates' Court sentenced him to 250 hours' community service.

Daniel
 Orrell, 24, was given a £250 fine in Bolton, Lancashire, and sold 
poppies to show his remorese after being caught committing the same 
offence.

And Wendy Lewis, 32, from Blackpool, who urinated on the centopath was given a 15-week suspended jail sentence.

Victim: Marine Engineering Mechanic Alistair Leighton is remembered on the memorial. He died when HMS Ardent (pictured) sank in 1982 after being bombed by the Argentinians' A-4 Skyhawks aircraft
