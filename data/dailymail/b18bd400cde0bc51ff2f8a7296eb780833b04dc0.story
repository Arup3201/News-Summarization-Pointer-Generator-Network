A disgraced former governor of a school linked to the Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham is being sued over claims he barred staff brought in after an Ofsted inspection.

Waseem Yaqub is alleged to have harassed staff appointed to turn the Al-Hijrah School around, according to a high court writ lodged by the city council for up to £100,000.

The writ also accuses Mr Yaqub of intimidation and trespassing on the Bordesley Green school site after the council disbanded the governing body he headed in May.

The school, Birmingham's only Islamic school, is for pupils aged four to 16 and was once one of the most sought after in the country.

But it was placed in special measures after Ofsted inspections found classroom standards were in decline. Al-Hijrah was also found to have a budget deficit of £889,000.

An Interim Executive Board (IEB) was drafted in but, according to the writ, Mr Yaqub successfully thwarted the IEB's work – denying members access to the school and even using security guards to threaten and intimidate them.

In June, the council won an injunction banning Mr Yaqub from the school after he repeatedly returned there despite his dismissal.

But the IEB was twice blocked from entering the premises by protesters led by Mr Yaqub.

The Labour-run council and the IEB, which have issued the writ, also claim Mr Yaqub wrote an email accusing the board of being a 'hit squad', undertaking a 'dawn raid'.

The writ seeks damages of between £50,000 and £100,000, claiming Mr Yaqub was repeatedly abusive to three IEB members. No date has been fixed for the damages hearing.

Al-Hijrah, a state-funded Muslim faith school, was not one of the 21 inspected by Ofsted in connection with the so-called Trojan Horse plot to oust secular heads and governors at state schools and force through strict Islamic principles.

However, most of the individuals claimed to be key figures in the alleged plot have strong links to the Al-Hijrah Trust, the body which owns and, until May, ran the school. Tahir Alam, the plot's alleged ringleader, was secretary to the Al-Hijrah Trust and head of the Al-Hijrah Training Academy, which, according to its website, trains Muslim parents to 'empower the community to ensure our needs are met'.

Mr Yaqub was seconded as a 'consultant' to Saltley School at the same time as its respected non-Muslim head teacher, Balwant Bains, was removed, though he denied any involvement.

The chairman of governors at Saltley, Mohammed Ikhlaq, was then hired by Al-Hijrah as a 'leadership consultant' at a cost of £23,000.

As well as seeking damages, the writ also seeks to ban Mr Yaqub from having any further involvement or contact with the school.

Mr Yaqub has a seven-year-old child at the school. 'They are trying to ban me having a say in my child's education,' he said. 'That is an infringement of my right to a family life.' He branded the allegations in the writ 'spurious and false' and described the protest he led outside the school as peaceful.

A council spokesman could not comment on ongoing legal matters.
