Madonna has been accused of blackmail, demanding special treatment and bullying state officials in Malawi – the country that once dubbed her a ‘saint’.

In an extraordinary outburst, the president of the African state even told the billionaire singer she ought to take lessons in manners from Premiership footballers Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville.

President Joyce Banda claims the 54-year-old, who adopted two of her four children from Malawi, has failed to keep her promise to spend money improving infrastructure in the impoverished nation.

But Madonna’s management claim the 
‘nonsense’ attack is retaliation for the singer sacking president 
Banda’s sister from one of her charity organisations amid allegations 
funds were mishandled.

In a statement following Madonna’s 
latest visit, President Banda accused her of wanting the government to 
‘roll out the red carpet’, adding: ‘If Madonna believes she deserved to 
be treated differently . . . it is worth making her aware that Malawi 
has hosted many international stars, including Chuck Norris, Bono, David
 James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville, who have never demanded state 
attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature.’

The singer said she was ‘saddened’ by 
the ‘ridiculous allegations’. Her relationship with Malawi began with 
her pledge to donate millions to set up schools, orphanages and medical 
centres. The promise appeared to fast-track her adoption of son David in
 2006. She adopted daughter Mercy James in 2009.

The statement went on to say Madonna had not been invited by the president - and should stop exaggerating her contributions to the country.

It said: 'Among the many things that Madonna needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the truth.

'For her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in Malawi when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with the manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur.

'The difference between a school and a classroom should be the most obvious thing for a person demanding state courtesy to decipher.'

It comes as claims of a feud between Madonna - who has two adopted children from Malawi, David Banda and Mercy Jones - and the President Joyce Banda.

The statement said a pop star was not automatically deserving of a state welcome or extra attention.'In the feeling of Madonna, the Malawi Government and its leadership should have rolled out a red carpet and blasted the 21-gun salute in her honour because she believes that as a musician, the whiff of whose repute flies across international boundaries, she automatically is candidate for VIP treatment,' the statement read.

'Granted, Madonna has adopted two children from Malawi. According to the record, this gesture was humanitarian and of her accord. 'It, therefore, comes across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act, prompted only by her, Madonna wants Malawi to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude.

'Kindness, as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned, is free and anonymous. 

'If it can't be free and silent, it is not kindness; it is something else. Blackmail is the closest it becomes.'

The statement finished by saying the Malawi Government continues to 
welcome philanthropists hoping to improve the welfare for the people of 
Malawi.

The President of Malawi has given 
Madonna an astonishing verbal slap down in which she accuses the pop 
star of coming close to 'blackmailing' the impoverished African country.

The sarcasm-laden statement 
criticises Madonna for believing that 'she is....doing Malawi good' and 
that she therefore 'automatically [a] candidate for VIP treatment.'

After noting that Madonna has adopted
 two Malawian children as her own, the very strongly-worded statement 
goes on to accuse the singer of near blackmail.

'It....comes
 across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act.... 
Madonna wants Malawi to be forever chained to the obligation of 
gratitude.

'Kindness, as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned, is free and anonymous.

'If
 it can’t be free and silent, it is not kindness; it is something else. 
Blackmail is the closest it becomes', the statement, which was reported 
in Malawi’s Nyasa Times newspaper read.

Madonna
 has been a frequent visitor the impoverished southern African country 
since she adopted two children - David and Mercy - from there in 2006 
and 2009 respectively.

However, the Material Girl’s 
relationship with the country has soured, primarily over accusations 
that she failed to make good on a promise to invest in local schooling.

Malawi’s new, forthright, president Dr
 Banda is also reportedly fed up with the pop star’s portrayal of the 
country as a helpless basketcase.

This latest war of words comes after 
Madonna was stripped of her VVIP (Very, Very Important Person) status on
 a recent trip to the country.

As a result she and her large entourage -
 which included four of her children -were forced to go through Kamuzu 
airport alongside ordinary passengers when they left the country on 
Saturday.

During
 the ten days the party had spent in the country, Malawi’s education 
minister accused Madonna of “exaggerating” the extent of her charitable 
work.

What’s more, a handwritten request by Madonna for an audience with President Joyce Banda was left unanswered.

The
 singer’s spokesman reportedly claimed that double snub was prompted by 
President Banda’s sister Anjimile Oponyo whom Madonna sacked as the head
 of her Raising Malawi charity amid denied allegations of theft.

The extraordinary statement from the 
Malawian government addressed the singer’s gripes directly - and 
contrasts her behaviour with other celebrities including English 
footballers David James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville whom, the 
statement claims, “have never demanded state attention or decorum 
despite their equally dazzling stature”.

The
 statement reads: “Granted, Madonna is a famed international musician. 
But that does not impose an injunction of obligation on any government 
under whose territory Madonna finds herself, including Malawi, to give 
her state treatment.

'As stated earlier....such treatment, even if she deserved it, is discretionary not obligatory.

'It
 should be put on record that Madonna did not come to Malawi at the 
invitation of the President nor her government. In other words, she was 
neither the guest of the President nor of her government.

'For all that is known, she came to 
Malawi like any other visitor that feels like coming to Malawi. Such 
visitors don’t have to meet with the President and are never amenable to
 state attention or graces.

'If the argument is that because she is 
an internationally renowned star, and, therefore, Madonna believes she 
deserved to be treated differently from other visiting foreigners, it is
 worth making her aware that Malawi has hosted many international stars,
 including Chuck Norris, Bono, David James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary 
Neville who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their
 equally dazzling stature.

'Among the many things that Madonna 
needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the 
truth.

For her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in 
Malawi when she has actually only contributed to the construction of 
classrooms is not compatible with manners of someone who thinks she 
deserves to be revered with state grandeur.

The difference between a 
school and a class room should be the most obvious thing for a person 
demanding state courtesy to decipher.

'For her to accuse Mrs. Oponyo for 
indiscretions that have clearly arisen from her personal frustrations 
that her ego has not been massaged by the state is uncouth, and speaks 
volumes of a musician who desperately thinks she must generate 
recognition by bullying state officials instead of playing decent music 
on the stage.”

The statement, issued by Malawi 
government press officer Tusekele Mwanyongo concludes that “acts of 
kindness must always remain as such; they must not smack of blackmail. 
In addition, let philanthropists not hold to ransom the President and 
any official of her Government because they showed some kindness to any 
Malawian.'

But a counter statement issued by the popstar accused President Banda of telling lies.

Madonna said: 'I'm saddened that Malawi president Joyce Banda has chosen to release lies about what we've accomplished, my intentions, how I personally conducted myself while visiting Malawi and other untruths.

'I did not ever ask or demand special treatment at the airport or elsewhere during my visit.

'I will not be distracted or discouraged by other people's political agendas.

'I made a promise to the children of Malawi and I'm keeping that promise.'
