President Barack Obama
 said Sunday that he had raised the need for improved human rights in 
Malaysia with the country's prime minister, but pushed back against 
suggestions that his failure to meet with a top opposition leader means 
he is not concerned.

Human rights groups have 
been urging Obama to meet with opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim while 
Obama is in the country as part of his four-nation Asia tour. Instead, 
Obama is sending national security adviser Susan Rice to meet Anwar on 
Monday.

Obama cited freedom of the press, 
human rights and civil liberties as issues that he said are always on 
the agenda when he travels the world. He downplayed the fact that a 
meeting with Anwar wasn't on his schedule.

'The
 fact that I haven't met Mr. Anwar in and of itself is not indicative of
 our lack of concern, given the fact that there are a lot of people I 
don't meet with and opposition leads that I don't meet with,' he said 
at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Najib Razak after the two
 met privately.

'That doesn't mean I'm not concerned about them.'

Obama,
 who met with Najib during a historic, two-day visit to Malaysia, 
defended the government's handling of the search for missing Malaysia 
Airlines Flight 370. He also said Russia will soon be hit with new 
sanctions because President Vladimir Putin's government has "not lifted a
 finger" to help diffuse tensions in Ukraine.

Anwar,
 a former deputy prime minister, was recently convicted for the second 
time on sodomy charges that the U.S. and international human rights 
groups have challenged as politically motivated. He presents the most 
potent political threat to Najib, whose popularity has declined over the
 past two elections.

Obama said Najib has made
 progress on human rights in his country and would be the first to 
acknowledge having more work to do to improve the climate. Obama said he
 shared with Najib his own view that countries will be better off in the
 long run if they respect the rule of law and basic freedoms - 'even 
when it drives you crazy, even when it's inconvenient.'

The United States still has work to do on these issues, too, Obama added.

In
 his own defense, Najib said he and Obama are 'equally concerned about 
civil liberties as a principle' and touted steps he says he has taken to
 promote them. Answering his critics, Najib said: 'Don't underestimate 
or diminish whatever we have done.'

Obama is 
the first American president to visit Malaysia in nearly 50 years. He 
opened a busy, first full day in the country Sunday by touring the 
National Mosque of Malaysia in black socks, going shoeless in keeping 
with protocol. After the events with Najib, Obama stopped at an 
entrepreneurial center. He then went to the University of Malaya to 
announce a new initiative to increase U.S. engagement with the region's 
young people and answer questions.

At the news
 conference, Obama defended Najib's government's handling of the search 
for the missing airplane. The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people, most of 
them Chinese, has been missing since March 8 and is believed to be deep 
at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.

Anguished 
relatives of the passengers have been vocal about their unhappiness with
 the fruitless search effort, including recently demonstrating outside 
the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing.

'The 
Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and 
investigate exactly what happened,' Obama said.'

'I can't speak for all 
the countries in the region but I can say that the United States and 
other partners have found the Malaysian government eager for assistance 
and fully forthcoming with us in terms of the information that they 
have.'

Obama said he understands the heartache
 and suffering of the passengers' loved ones, but added that it will 
take even more time to find the plane because of the huge amount of 
ocean being scoured.

'Obviously, we don't know
 all the details of what happened but we do know that, if in fact the 
plane went down in the ocean in this part of the world, that is a big 
place and it is a very challenging effort and laborious effort that's 
going to take quite some time,' he said.

On 
tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Obama said there's strong evidence 
Russia is encouraging destabilizing activities in eastern and southern 
Ukraine. He blamed Russia for failing to uphold terms of a recent deal 
reached in Geneva with Russia, the U.S., the European Union and Ukraine.

The
 accord calls on Russia to pull back its forces from the border with 
Ukraine and encourage pro-Russian separatists to turn over buildings 
they're occupying in eastern Ukraine. Speaking a day before the U.S. was
 expected to levy new sanctions against Russia, Obama said what the 
accord 'asks of Russia is hardly onerous.'

Obama departs Malaysia on Monday for the Philippines, following earlier stops in Japan and South Korea.

Two
 Philippine officials told The Associated Press on Sunday that the two 
governments have reached a 10-year pact that would allow a larger U.S. 
military presence in the country. The agreement was due to be signed 
Monday before Obama arrives.
