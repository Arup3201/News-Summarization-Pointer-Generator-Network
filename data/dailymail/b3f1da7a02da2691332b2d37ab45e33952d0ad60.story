Tallah Khosravian is a Middle Eastern entrepreneur with no business acumen who came 17th on the Dubai edition of The Apprentice.

Natascha Leboushkin is the high-maintenance widow of a Russian octogenarian millionaire who has come to Britain with her stepson Neblov to find herself a new rich husband  but finds herself doing community service for unpaid parking fines.

And Wakana Fukui is the naive teenage Japanese YouTube star who was brought to Britain by her father and is trying to make it as an online pop culture reporter.

In fact, so realistic are these three hilariously ridiculous characters - created and played by former law student-turned-comedian Mona Yousefi, 31, a comedy star currently being touted as the female Sacha Baron Cohen - that you'd be forgiven for thinking they are real people. They even have their own Twitter accounts.

Mona - who blagged her way into Channel 4 offices by attaching a DVD of her mockumentary sketches to a helium balloon, then bribing a post boy to ensure it landed on an executive desk - is being touted as the next big thing in British comedy.

Her witty skits follow three witless 
foreigners - the Japanese Lolita, the Russian social climber and the Middle Eastern businesswoman desperate to climb into business bed with Richard Branson - who have arrived in Britain and are attempting to find their 
place in the country. Without much luck.

Going Native - in which Mona's girls interact with unsuspecting real people who have no idea they are being set up for comic situations and gentle ridicule - recalls Sacha Baron Cohen and his outlandish characters Ali G, Borat and Bruno.

Mona - who only agreed to play the 
three characters she had created when none of her actor friends would do
it - fully immerses herself in each girl, wearing specific perfume for 
each one and even eating like them and talking like them between takes during filming, according to The Daily Beast.

She is the Daniel Day Lewis method actor of British comedy.

'They each also have their own perfume,' Mona told the website, explaining that Tallah's is so strong 'you can smell it three minutes before she enters a room', while Wakanaâ€™s is 'sickeningly sweet' and Natascha's has 'pheromones for her to trap her men'.

She even spent almost a month living with a Japanese friend in order to nail the accent.

Clips from the show - which was developed with Hat Trick Productions - appeared on YouTube, and Going Native was
quickly commissioned by BBC as an on-air and online pilot, now 
available on iPlayer. It will be premiered on BBC 3 later this year.
