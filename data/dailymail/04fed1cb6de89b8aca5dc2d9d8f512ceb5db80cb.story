It sounds like something from a science fiction film, but a pill to counter the ageing process could become a reality.

Scientists in Russia are testing a new formula, which they claim can delay the start of the ageing process.

They hope the tablet, which is being tested on rats, mice, fish and dogs, will allow people to live to at least 120.

Scientists are working on a pill to counter ageing that would allow people to live to 120. They are testing a new formula on rats, mice, fish and dogs, which they claim can delay the ageing process

Researcher Dr Maxim Skulachev, from the Moscow State University project, said: 'A lot of aging diseases developed much slower.' 

The scientists are using a 'new type of antioxidant', which they hope will impact on on the mitochondria, the energy-producing part of cells, which is seen as triggering ageing.

'The mitochondria are to be blamed for heart attacks, they are linked to diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's,' he said.

Dr Maxim Skulachev, from the Moscow State University said if successful, ''t will be possible to postpone old age'

He pointed to the naked mole-rat of east Africa renowned for longevity and evidently immune to cancer.

A realistic goal was to aim for a life span for humans of 120, and anti-ageing medication was 'technically possible', he told Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.

'I don't believe we will be able to live to 800,' he said.

'Most probably, some new disease will emerge, let's say, a typical disease for a 120-year-old.

'That was the case with cancer, which was a rare disease when ancient people died much younger.'

The Russian tests have not led to an significant life span increase, but delayed the onset of ageing, he said.

'If it turns out that diseases develop more slowly, our idea to fight aging through mitochondria is the right one, added Dr Skulachev, who has been working to perfect his treatment for decades.

'It will be possible to postpone old age.'
