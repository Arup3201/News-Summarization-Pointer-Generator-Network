Dave Lee Travis, 69, pictured arriving at London's Southwark Crown Court today - he faces two charges of indecent assault and one of sexual assault

Former BBC DJ Dave Lee Travis arrived at court today to answer three charges of sexual and indecent assault.

The 69-year-old former Radio 1 presenter faces a retrial on one count of indecent assault and one of sexual assault after jurors in a trial earlier this year failed to reach a verdict on them.

He is also accused of one new count of indecent assault on a woman over 16 from 1995.

Travis, who is charged under his real name of David Griffin, arrived at London's Southwark Crown Court this morning in a pink herringbone jacket, red tie and black trousers.

In February this year, the former Radio 1 star was cleared of carrying out 12 sex attacks on young women after a six-week trial.

The Crown Prosecution Service then announced that Travis would be retried over two allegations on which the jury had failed to agree.

The first concerns an alleged assault  in 1990, and the second relates to an alleged attack  in 2008.

The new charge relates to an alleged assault on a young woman in January 1995.

Travis, from Buckland, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, denies all three charges. 

The former Radio 1 disc jockey, seen outside court this morning, denies all three charges against him
