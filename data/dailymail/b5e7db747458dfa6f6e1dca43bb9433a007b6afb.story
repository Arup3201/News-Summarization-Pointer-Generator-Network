Clothing giant ASOS has started taking orders again three days after its warehouse was devastated in an arson attack affecting £22million of stock.

The fashion website was forced to suspend orders after the blaze in Barnsley on Friday night affected 20 per cent of stock at the site.

More than 50 firefighters were called to the firm's headquarters in South Yorkshire, which is the size of six football pitches and handles £1.2billion in sales a year.

No one was injured but 500 staff were evacuated and thousands of potential customers left in limbo after the company replaced its website with a message saying it was 'pausing' all new orders.

The firm said customers would be able to apply for refunds after photos emerged of a huge pile of shoes, shirts and dresses outside the warehouse.

Up in smoke: Huge piles of clothes were amassed outside ASOS' warehouse today after an arson attack

The major fashion firm is still assessing the damage, which looks to include shoes, dresses and shirts

Vast: An estimated 10million items were in the distribution centre. It is not known how many were damaged

In a statement, ASOS said its 'overriding concern' was its staff, adding: 'We are very relieved that no one has been hurt.'

The company is fully insured for the loss of stock and business interruption, although the disruption meant its shares fell 3 per cent.

ASOS said in a stock market statement: 'None of the technology, automation or structure of the building has been affected by the fire.

'Our initial estimate is that approximately 20 per cent of the total stock at the site has been compromised by fire damage and the sprinkler systems.'

At the end of May, ASOS held £159million of stock at cost, of which around 70 per cent is held at Barnsley.

Spokesman Matthew Smallwood told MailOnline yesterday: 'I can confirm that some orders have been delayed but cannot confirm how many at the moment.

When will my clothes arrive?

Some orders have been delayed, but the firm can't yet confirm how many, or for how long. However, it says the warehouse will hopefully be back up and running tomorrow.

Has my order been cancelled?

At this point ASOS is not believed to have cancelled any orders - yours will come, but it might take a little longer.

I don't want to wait. How do I get a refund?

Visit the firm's customer services page and click 'cancel order'.

'Customers will either receive a full refund or get their orders as soon as possible.'

Customers have had difficulty confirming whether their orders had been disrupted or when the service would be back online.

Though most expressed sympathy for the staff, some complained about the fire on Twitter.

@Lameese_Yousif said: 'Can't believe I probably won't receive my prom dress. Thanks alot ASOS', while @HeyItsJoy added: 'Thanks asos... I really wanted to order today aswell. Can we all get free next day delivery pls pls.'

A statement on the website for ASOS, short for As Seen On Screen, said: 'Dear Customers, we have pressed pause on the ASOS website, this is due 
to a fire in our Barnsley distribution centre in the early hours of 
Saturday morning.

'Thankfully
 no one was hurt and we expect to be back to normal for you in the next 
day or so. So please hold on to your orders, we will be back with you 
soon'.

Damage: Despite the scale of the fire, ASOS said it hoped operations would be back to normal within a day

Reaction: Not all customers were sympathetic - one on Twitter was upset after the website went offline

Prom dress: Fashionistas voiced their shock at the fire - as well as the delay to their summer wardrobes

Launched in 2000 by Briton Nick Robertson (right) - the great-grandson of retailer Austin Reed - and fellow entrepreneur Quentin Griffiths, ASOS is now one of the biggest fashion names in the country.

Making its name with loud, characteristic prints and own-brand designs, the firm exploded into life despite critics insisting shoppers would want to try things on before buying.

By 2005 it had a million users, but user numbers would only truly take off once it introduced free shipping in 2010.

Last year it boasted offices in New York, Lille, Berlin and Shanghai and almost 8million users.

Its founders are now multi-millionaires, a status unlikely to be rocked by this week's fire.

In 2005 the firm faced a remarkably similar setback when its previous warehouse was damaged in the Buncefield oil terminal explosion in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.

The firm's finances could be dented, however. With it hoping to make £1.2billion of sales through the warehouse this year, each day lost to the fire could cost an average of £3.2million.

Customers can ask about refunds through the company's customer services line.

South Yorkshire Police are treating the fire just after 10pm on Friday as deliberate.

The
 warehouse, which claims to be the largest employer in South Yorkshire 
with 3,000 workers on peak days, contained an estimated 10million 
clothes packages when the fire broke out.

Investigating
 Fire Officer for South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, Simon Rodgers, said: 
'The fire involved four floors of the warehouse and the blaze was 
contained in the area of origin by firefighters.

'ASOS staff had a good evacuation process in place which assisted the 
emergency services and allowed the fire to be brought under control more
 quickly.'

Three of the ten fire engines had to be called in from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue.

A
 fire service spokesman said at 7am today: 'The fire is now out, with 
one fire engine remaining at the scene to ensure any remaining "hot 
spots" to not reignite.

'At its height, the fire was tackled by 10 fire engines, an aerial ladder platform and a High Volume Pump.'

Michael
 Dugher, MP for Barnsley East , tweeted last night: 'Huge thanks to the 
brilliant crews from @SYFR + @West-Yorks-FRS for tackling the @ASOS 
fire. They do a magnificent job. Glad no one hurt.'

One
 of Brtiain's fastest-growing online firms, the retailer sells fashion 
and beauty products and last year made sales of more than £750million.

Blaze: The fire spread to four floors of the warehouse in Barnsley and involved more than 50 firefighters

Fashion giant: How the retailer's website usually looks. It expects sales to top £1billion this year

Global hub: ASOS runs its operations from the warehouse in Barnsley and it had around 10million packages

Work
 began last January to extend the warehouse after the firm moved its 
operations in 2011 from a previous site in Hemel Hempstead, 
Hertfordshire.

The
 spokesman said it was too early to assess the damage to the warehouse or the implications for the business.

In 2005, ASOS stopped
 trading over Christmas after an explosion at the Buncefield oil depot near its 
previous warehouse in Hertfordshire.
