A high school Spanish teacher has been removed from classes after he reportedly urinated on himself after turning up drunk for a lesson. 

The male teacher, who has not not been named, was removed from Southington High School in Connecticut last Thursday morning.

Parents were notified in a letter from the school where the teacher's actions were described as 'inappropriate behavior'.

School authorities did not go into details of the incident but called it a 'personal issue' which was being dealt with by staff. 

According to teens at the school, several students videotaped the incident where the teacher also allegedly pinned a student against the wall.  

Students told local news stations that the behavior was out of the ordinary for a well-like teacher but that gossip about the incident has spread like wild fire through the school. 

Senior Justin Flanagan told WTNH: 'I heard that a teacher, a Spanish teacher, came in drunk to school, and I guess he got in an altercation with a student.' 

The teacher was not arrested nor was the incident reported to police. 

The school refused to give further details on the teacher's future at the school but said that they are investigating.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the principal of Southington High School.
