Newcastle will appeal to the Premier League in a bid to bring in a goalkeeper on emergency loan after Jak Alnwick injured his shoulder in Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup defeat at Tottenham.

He is deputising in the absence of the injured Tim Krul and Rob Elliot, neither of whom is expected to return until the middle of January at the earliest.

Alnwick is a major doubt for Sunday’s derby against Sunderland at St James’ Park and manager Alan Pardew does not want to start 17-year-old Freddie Woodman in such a hothouse.

‘The rules do allow you have to an emergency loan if you have only one fit professional keeper,’ said Pardew.

‘There is not a lot of time for recovery with Sunday in mind and there is no way a 17-year-old can go in goal in the Premier League.

‘I feel for Jak. It’s a cruel game and he’s really in the firing line at the moment.’

Newcastle lost 4-0 against Tottenham as Alnwick had a game to forget, gifting two of the goals on Wednesday
