A morbidly obese mother-of-four shed an incredible 25 stone through dedicated diet and exercise.

Jennifer Bodek, 49, from Thurso in the Highlands, beat her crippling food addiction, ditched her mobility scooter, and ran the 5k Race for Life to celebrate.

Now a keen runner, Jennifer couldn’t buy clothes from plus-size store Evans because they only went up to a size 34 - and she needed an estimated sized 48.

She hopes to inspire other people so that they too can lose weight without having to resort to surgery

She used to get 
through 24 bags of crisps a day, eat two McDonalds meals at a time and 
then a third for the journey home.

Her waistline was so wide at seven feet that she stitched her own home-made swimming costume because she couldn't find one to fit.

Then she was admitted to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, with double pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Three doctors brought her back to life twice after her heart failed, and it took ten nurses to roll her over because she was so heavy.

She
 spent seven days in intensive care and a total of 21 days on the ward 
and had to be revived twice after suffering heart failure.

During that time she saw an image of her children standing around her grave, weeping. It was a turning point in her life.

After her ordeal she vowed to slim down in 2010 and has since lost a staggering 25 stone in three years and three months.

Jennifer, who is currently unemployed, weighed 39 stone and was told 
she would die if she did not diet. She now weighs 14 stone and wears a 
size 18. She is hoping to get down to 12.

Before she lost weight Jeniffer could barely get out of her mobility scooter or turn the steering wheel in her car because her stomach was in 
the way.

Now she runs miles at a time on a regular basis and 
volunteers as a British Divers Marine Medic rescuing seals, dolphins 
and whales.

'Going from a mobility scooter to a 5k Race for Life run in Inverness is quite an amazing journey,' she said this week.

She completed the run in aid of cancer research in 46 minutes in memory of her mother, father and sister.

Jennifer,
 who admitted she had a lapse in her diet last year and put on five 
stone, managed to get back on track and lost 9st 3lbs in 
33 weeks.

She controls her weight by eating sensibly, walking, going 
to the gym and running regularly.

'I am going to keep this up. It has got to the
 point now where it is a way of living and I feel I am no longer 
captured in my own body,' she said.

'I decided I didn’t want to be fat and 50. I was as big as a whale, and now I’m rescuing them.'

Jennifer lost the weight through sheer determination.

She'd tried diets before, but says she succeeded with meal replacement diet All About Weight, who temporarily put you on shakes, soups and bars instead of usual hearty meals.

She now has porridge for breakfast, and a
 chocolate milkshake for lunch.

For her dinner she’ll choose from 
cottage pie, spaghetti bolognese, curried noodles or soup, with a 
milkshake for supper. 

She lost 22lbs in her first week, and 9st 3lbs in her first 33 weeks.

Jennifer used to gorge on a typical breakfast of four slices of bread covered 
with fatty bacon with four sausages, smothered in tomato ketchup.

She would then get through 10 to 15 family-sized chocolate bars, half a gateau with cream 
and piles of chips and several McDonald's meals for dinner.

She says she was getting through around 5,000 calories a day.

Breakfast - 4 slices of bread with bacon, 4 sausages, lots tomato ketchup

Lunch - 10-15 family-sized chocolate bars, half a gateau with cream and piles of chips

Dinner - 2x McDonald's meals, and a third for the journey home

Snacks -  24 bags of crisps

Breakfast - Porridge

Lunch - A diet chocolate milkshake

Dinner - Either cottage pie, spaghetti bolognese, curried noodles or soup

Snack - A diet chocolate milkshake

'The
 problem with food as an addiction is that there’s always some of it in 
house. That makes it even harder to beat than cigarettes or alcohol,' she says.

Jennifer
 started piling on the pounds when she was 15. Her brother Terry Ellis,
 19, died in a farming accident when he was gassed by silage in 1980 and she turned to food for comfort in her grief. In 1983 her mother June Jones, 46, died of cancer, and that made matters worse.

More
 recently in 2,000 her sister Debbie Jones, died, aged 42, of cancer, and
 a fortnight ago her dad Peter Ellis, 67, also died of cancer.

She is
 now on a mission to lose weight and recently started up her website and runs a Facebook site 
called Diet or Die. It has more than 800 followers from various parts of the world including the UK, Australia, America and China.

She hopes to help other people with similar problems and to make a documentary to tell her story. A 
promotional teaser has been created to try and attract funding for the 
project.

Jennifer wrote to the prime minister this week in a bid to get some 
backing for both ventures.

She said she hopes to inspire other people so that they too can lose weight without having to resort to surgery, and included a link to her website and
 a copy of the teaser for the documentary.

She stressed the need to tackle the growing obesity problem and reminded David Cameron that it is expensive to eat healthily.

'A
 frozen lasagne costs about £2 but to make one is about £6. Fruit and 
vegetables are very expensive but you can buy a 24-pack of crisps for 
£1.99,' she stated.

For the promotional teaser she was asked to go into a supermarket 
and buy a 24-pack of crisps, and while she found it a daunting experience she managed to resist.

She now weighs 14 stone and wears a size 18. She is hoping to get down to 12

'I
 have not done that for over two years and doing it again was like 
asking an alcoholic to go in to get a bottle of vodka. It was quite an 
achievement.'

Jennifer is hoping to raise £5,000, 
including about £1,500 to get the documentary under way. She also plans 
to contact the Scottish Government.

She is delighted with the 
response her website has received and already has helped a number of 
people who are struggling with their weight. The money she gets for that will be used for the helpline and the documentary.

Jennifer and 12 other obese people will be raising 
money by posing naked for a calendar, and are hoping to record a song to 
generate funds.
