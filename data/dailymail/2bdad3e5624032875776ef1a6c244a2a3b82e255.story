Vice president of the Versace group, Donatella Versace, said of the perfume: 'Eros Pour Femme is the ultimate in power and seduction from Versace. From the captivating fragrance to the elegance of the bottle and the stunning campaign by Mert Alas & Marcus Piggott starring Lara Stone.'

According to Donatella the perfume is designed to capture the primal power of a woman, with Lara being their ideal femme fatale.

The bottle's gold design shows the Medusa head which is synonymous with Versace brand. 

This is not Lara's first fragrance campaign. In July the model's famous pout took centre stage in a new advert for Stella McCartney's signature fragrance, STELLA. 

At the time Stella revealed that there was no other model she would have chosen: 'STELLA is a celebration of women, and Lara is the perfect representation,' she said.

'She brings the ideas of the fragrance alive, in an honest way, she is a modern woman who is approachable and sensual at the same time.'

Lara, who is married to comedian David Walliams, recently caused a stir when she took part in a completely unedited shoot for System magazine. In the beautiful images, shot by the world famous Juergen Teller, a nearly naked Lara is seen showing off her post baby body.

The model has previously made no bones about the fact that her body has changed since giving birth to her son Alfred in May 2013. 

She said in an interview with The Edit earlier this year: 'Everyone's got arm flab or saggy boobs. It's the way it is. I'm just trying to accept it right now. And it's OK, because the things women can do with their bodies are amazing.' 

She admitted that, like many new mothers, she struggled to lose her baby weight. 

'I'd never had to lose a significant amount of weight. I found it quiet stressful; this huge mountain of weight to lose,' she said.

But her friend and trainer, Bodyism founder James Duigan helped her to see things in perspective: '[James] showed me that it wasn't really about that and it was about being a mother and having this beautiful baby.'

Mr Teller said of the unretouched shoot: 'I'm often asked the question: 'What is beauty for you?' But I don't really think in those terms. I just find a lot of things beautiful when you open your mind.' 

Lara and David first got together in 2009, announcing their engagement in 2010. 

Following their marriage, which took place in London's Claridge's hotel, the pair revealed in December 2012 that they were expecting their first child with Alfred being born the next year.

Following his first birthday Lara described how emotional she found it to watch her little boy growing up.

'On his (Alfred's) birthday, I cried the whole day,' she said, 'When they're born and just a helpless little blob laid on your chest, they're so vulnerable and little. And now he's this huge monster - in the loveliest way. 

'He doesn't really say words, but he can make himself understood. He's very strong minded and he knows exactly what he wants to do, and if it's not right he'll have a huge tantrum. 

'He's completely hilarious – this little boy, stamping his little foot.'

Lovely couple: Earlier this year Lara attended the GQ Men of The Year Awards with her husband comedian David Walliams, the pair first got together in 2009
