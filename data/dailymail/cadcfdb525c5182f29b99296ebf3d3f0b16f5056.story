When she met Derek McMaster, divorcee Jean Antrobus thought she had found the perfect gentleman.

He behaved like an ‘angel’, buying her flowers every week and taking her away for romantic trips by the sea. Within months he had proposed, saying he was madly in love with her.

In fact, McMaster was a conman. The 64-year-old, who pretended to be a retired police officer, was busy plundering her savings – and those of another woman, to whom he was engaged at the same time.

Mrs Antrobus, also 64, found out that she had been robbed of more than £5,000 only after her credit card was rejected when she went to pay for a private operation.

Police were called and they discovered that McMaster was living a double life. Yesterday he was facing jail after he admitted stealing from the two women.

Mrs Antrobus, a mother of two, said: ‘I feel really hurt and betrayed. I trusted him, but he used me and broke my heart. He’s a terrible conman.’

McMaster, a former lorry driver, was due to stand trial, but pleaded guilty to two charges of theft during a hearing at Warrington Crown Court.

Mrs Antrobus, of Runcorn, Cheshire, said she had been completely ‘charmed’ by McMaster after they met through a lonely hearts advert about a year ago.

The former shop worker said yesterday: ‘I had been married for 38 years. I’d never answered a lonely hearts advert in my  life before, but I was feeling a bit fed up so I decided to ring the number.

Elaborate: Warrington Crown Court (pictured) found that McMaster's victims did not know they were being two-timed until they arrived to give evidence

‘He was an angel at first, he bought me bouquets of flowers every week and took me away for weekends, a real gentleman.

‘He said, “Let’s get married. I never loved anyone like you”. He was convincing and I loved him, but now I realise I was paying for it all along.’

Last June the couple held  a big engagement party, but  by that time McMaster had already been stealing from her on a regular basis. ‘He said he was a retired police officer and worked part time,’ she added.

‘He had a full uniform and handcuffs and used to come home with tales of how he had arrested drug users, but now I know he had simply bought the outfit over the internet.’

She discovered the truth last August, when she went to have private corrective surgery on her jaw and her credit card was rejected at the hospital.

In total, McMaster stole £5,224 from her between March and June last year.

Police discovered he was also engaged to 63-year-old Margaret Dickenson, who is a kidney dialysis patient. She had been conned out of £1,350.

McMaster took both women’s credit cards without their knowledge, and asked them  for their PINs so he could buy their shopping.

Mrs Antrobus said: ‘When I realised he had been seeing the other lady, I realised he was leading two separate lives. It was like kicking me in the ribs. I’ve never been so shocked in all my life.’

Judge David Hale told McMaster, of Liverpool, to expect jail when he is sentenced later this month.
