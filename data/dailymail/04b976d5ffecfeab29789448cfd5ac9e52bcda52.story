Usain Bolt has given the 2014 
Commonwealth Games a  massive boost by announcing he is ‘available for 
selection’, albeit only in the 4x100metres relay.

The
 world and Olympic 100m and 200m champion has yet to compete this season
 after suffering a foot injury and will miss this weekend’s Jamaican 
Championships, but has said he is ‘available for relay duty’ in Glasgow.

Crowds
 at Hampden Park, however, will still see Bolt in action for less than 
20 seconds if he runs in the heats and final at the Games: the 100m 
world record-holder was clocked at 8.70secs for the anchor leg of 
Jamaica’s sprint relay triumph at the London 2012 Olympics.

Jamaica have yet to name their athletics team for Glasgow, although former 100m world champion Yohan Blake has already declared himself unavailable, prompting further questions about why Team England’s squad was announced on June 16 and selected two weeks previously.

The early cut-off time for qualification meant Britain’s current fastest male 100m runner, Chijindu Ujah, missed out on selection as he did not run 9.96secs in Hengelo, Holland until June 8.

The oversight means Ujah will instead concentrate on guaranteeing his place in Great Britain’s team for August’s European Championships in Zurich by finishing in the top two at this weekend’s Sainsbury’s British Championships in Birmingham.

The 20-year-old’s coach, Jonas Taiwah-Dodoo, believes Ujah is capable of dipping under 9.9secs this season, putting him on course to break Linford Christie’s British record of 9.87secs, and could also win his first senior medal in Zurich.

Taiwah-Dodoo said: ‘I would expect him
 to get faster. With the same conditions as Hengelo, can he run 9.8secs?
 I don’t see why not. And can he go to Europeans and challenge for a 
medal? For sure.‘This is the greatest British sprinting has ever 
been. Now we’ve not only got 9.9sec guys, but a plethora of other guys 
who have all run 10.1 this year.’

Taiwah-Dodoo
 said Ujah was so ‘technically bad it was scary’ when he first met him 
four years ago, but the youngster is now bidding to become British 100m 
champion tomorrow afternoon in Birmingham.

Ujah, the third fastest 
British man in history, said: ‘I don’t believe I’m a  one-hit wonder. I 
believe that if I  execute my race on Sunday and the conditions are good
 I’ll run a fast time. Every race I go into I’ll definitely aim to win 
it.

‘I still feel there is a lot more to be done and a lot more to 
achieve. It is definitely good being the fastest in the UK right now, 
but you then have to go out and prove you can do it at a world level.’
