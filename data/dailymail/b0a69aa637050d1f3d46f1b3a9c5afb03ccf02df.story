Pope Francis has said the hardest thing about his job is not being able to pop out for a pizza without being recognised

Pope Francis has said that he will only continue as pontiff for 'another two or three years', adding: 'I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time.'

As he completed his second year in the Catholic Church's top job, Francis said that he had 'a vague sensation' he would not reign as pope for long.

He told the Mexican broadcaster Televisa that he had the feeling his reign would be brief and perhaps only two or three years, suggesting it was like the psychology of a gambler who convinces himself he'll lose so he won't be disappointed if he wins.

He added: 'It is a somewhat vague sensation. But I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time, and nothing more.'

The mysterious premonition will inevitably spark concerns about Francis' health.

Francis is missing part of one lung after a childhood illness and suffers from sciatica. Last year he said that he believed he had only a few years to live.

He said: 'I know this is going to last a short time, two or three years and then... to the house of the Father.'

As he enters the beginning of his third year as pope, Francis sounded weary of the weight that comes with the job.

He said that he didn't mind being pope, but that it had been hard work to change his habit of moving around at will.

He said: 'The only thing I would like is to go out one day, without being recognised, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza.'

Francis also confirmed that he would consider retiring if he felt he could no longer perform his duties, but rejected the idea of an age limit.

His predecessor Pope Benedict XVI resigned in February 2013. Francis said 'Benedict should not be considered an exception, but an institution.' 

Also on Friday, Pope Francis marked the second anniversary of his election by declaring a jubilee year that will be interpreted as a powerful signal of his commitment to reforming the Church.

The extraordinary holy year, dedicated to the theme of mercy, has been called to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a groundbreaking Vatican council that transformed how the Church related to the modern world, most notably ending the obligation for religious services to be conducted in Latin.

The jubilee year will begin on December 8 and run until November 20, 2016.
