Fulfilling his dreams: Jake Stoneking, 19, from West linn, Oregon, drew up a 17-strong bucket list after diagnosed with medulloblastoma in 2009

A terminally-ill teenager has named visiting a strip club as the number one priority on his bucket list.

Jake Stoneking, 19, from West Linn, Oregon, drew up the document of things he wishes to do before he dies after being diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer in 2009.

It includes hunting a wild bear, getting a tattoo and watching a UFC fight.

But the number one thing Jake wanted to do was visit topless bar, Jiggles, in Tualatin.

And luckily for him, the club is one of the few in America that do not serve alcohol and therefore, allow under-21s into the premises.  

Now, the teenager has checked the wish off his list - as well as four other items, including taking a ride in a helicopter and shooting a pistol.

After Jake's visit, Jiggles general manager, Brian, told the New York Daily News: 'I am beyond flattered and I hope that he had an amazing time.'

He added that he wished he had known about the teenager's plans beforehand so he could have planned something special.

'I would have definitely tried to make sure that his experience there for a bucket list was a step-up from a normal experience for a customer coming off the street.'

Jake, who used to be a 140lb wrestler with 'six-pack abs', was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the age of 14 after suffering from a number of agonising headaches.

He underwent 12-hour surgery on the tumour in his cerebullum - the brain centre for balance and coordination - followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy.

During the treatment, his weight dropped to just 104lb and he had to relearn how to walk and eat.

'He had a tumour removed about the size of a golf ball,' his father, Todd Stoneking, told ABC News. 'It pretty much took him down to nothing.'

Medulloblastoma is a type of brain tumour that mainly affects children. 

It develops in the cerebellum - the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination and balance - but may spread to other parts of the brain.

Symptoms can include headaches, sickness, sight problems, slurred speech, neck stiffness and balance problems.

The tumour is more common in boys than girls - and makes up about 20 per cent of all childhood brain tumours.

Following months of gruelling treatment, Jake and his family were told his tumour had gone - only for it to return last month.

This time, the teenager was told his cancer was terminal - and he may have only three months left to live.

'We thought it was gone. They did scans every three months for a year to make sure it was gone,' said Mr Stoneking.

We found out in February it was back.'

He added that his son's tumour now stretches from his brain to the bottom of his spinal cord, where his nerves are 'matted' with cancer.

But despite his fate, Jake has taken his illness in his stride - and is quickly checking off items on his bucket list with the help of friends, family and kind-hearted strangers.

The 17-strong list includes laughing until he cries, getting 'Stoneking' tattooed on his back and holding a fundraising event.

'He put stuff on there that he knows can happen,' said Mr Stoneking.

'We know the time is coming. But he's doing pretty good and we can still do a lot of things.'

He added: 'He is an awesome kid. And I'm not just saying that because he's mine - there is something about him, his infectious smile.'

Jake is taking experimental chemotherapy drugs in a bid to buy himself an extra year while completing his bucket list.
