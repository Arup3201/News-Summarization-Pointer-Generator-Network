Prince William today suggested the growing threat of Scottish independence was more important than the news his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, was expecting again.

The Duke said Catherine, who is suffering acute morning sickness, was ‘feeling okay’ after a ‘tricky few days’.

But he added: ‘It’s important that we all focus on the big news and the big international and domestic things that are going on at the moment. That’s what my thoughts are at the moment.’ 

The remarks could be seen as a direct Royal intervention into the looming independence referendum just days after sources said the Queen was ‘concerned’ at the surge in support for separation.

Prince William, opening The Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre Building, this morning urged voters to focus on 'domestic' news rather than the news that he and his wife were expecting again

The Duke said his wife was feeling 'okay' but had been through a 'tricky few days'. But he urged people to concentrate on other developments

Amid growing panic that the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign had taken the lead just over a week before the referendum, the Queen held talks with the David Cameron in Balmoral this weekend.

The future of the Royal family has been a source of debate in the independence campaign, but the 'Yes' camp have insisted that the Queen will remain head of state in a future independent Scotland.

But a poll in The Times found more ‘yes’ voters now want to ditch the Queen as head of state of an independent Scotland than want to keep her in place, according to a new poll.

The YouGov poll found that 46 per cent of supporters of separation now believe that an independent Scotland should break its links with the UK royal family.

A total of 40 per cent believe an independent Scotland should keep the Queen, with 14 per cent undecided.

Among ‘no’ voters, the results are very different. More than two thirds of ‘no’ voters – 69 per cent – believe that an independent Scotland should keep the Queen, with just 18 per cent in favour of a Scottish republic and 13 per cent undecided.

The future of the Royal family in an independent Scotland has been thrown into doubt in recent days amid claims that the Queen is concerned about future conflicts of interest.

Pollsters today claimed that the Royal baby announcement could help tip support back in favour of the union.

A spokesman for ComRes told MailOnline: ‘The Queen is generally very popular in the UK and so are the young royals like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, probably more so than Prince Charles for example.

‘The royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the Queen’s reported concerns and now Kate’s pregnancy will bring that into focus.

‘There are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. It won’t be just because of the baby, but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result’.

The Queen, pictured at the Braemar Gathering in Scotland, is thought to be strongly in favour of the Union and will be in Scotland on September 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the UK

David Cameron, pictured with his wife Samantha and Prince Philip, held talks with the Queen amid panic at the prospect of the end of the 300-year-old Union

The Queen held talks with Mr Cameron yesterday amid panic at the prospect of the end of the 300-year-old Union.

There was said to be ‘great concern’ at Buckingham Palace over the prospect of separation.

The Queen, who is thought to strongly favour the Union, will be in Scotland on September 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the UK.

Pro-Union MPs said her presence at Balmoral would be a sign of continuity.

‘There is a strong anti-monarchy element in the Scottish National Party,’ said former defence secretary Liam Fox. 

‘You can bet your bottom dollar as soon as they get independence, their next target is going to be Scotland being a republic.’

A YouGov poll yesterday put support for independence at 51 per cent, with the No camp on 49 per cent. The Better Together campaign has surrendered a 22-point lead in the space of a month. The shock survey came as:

SNP leader Alex Salmond, pictured with the Queen, who says says he plans to keep her as head of state, but the SNP’s John Mason is calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after the Queen steps down or dies

Yesterday Peter Kellner, YouGov’s president, said: ‘In the past four weeks, support for the Union has drained away at an astonishing rate. The Yes campaign has not just invaded No territory – it has launched a blitzkrieg.’

However, a separate poll for the Yes Scotland campaign by pollsters Panelbase put the pro-Union camp still four points ahead – by 52 per cent to 48 per cent.

The three main Westminster parties have previously promised further devolution in the event of a No vote, telling Scottish voters they can remain in the UK and ‘have the best of both worlds’.

But this week’s promise of a fixed timetable, an attempt to shift away from the widely-criticised negative messages of the No campaign, echoes a similar package offered to the Canadian province of Quebec before an independence referendum in 1995, that snuffed out a late surge in support for breaking away.

Mr Osborne also insisted that if Scotland were to opt for independence then under no circumstances would it be able to use the pound as its currency, as Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond says he plan to do.

Gordon Brown, and his wife Sarah were campaigning on the streets of his hometown of Kirkcaldy in Fife, in a bid to shore up the no vote 

However, there were growing signs of strains in the cross-party coalition campaigning for Scotland to remain in the UK.

Labour former prime minister Mr Brown blamed the Tories for the narrowing polls, claiming the No camp was finding it difficult because of anger over Government policies including the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ and the cut in the 50p top rate of tax.

Dr Fox became the most senior Westminster figure to express concerns about Better Together, saying: ‘One of the problems has been that the No campaign has been trying to run a campaign based on logic and reason, while the nationalist campaign is entirely about emotion and sentiment.’

Mr Salmond dismissed the offer of a commission to hammer out new powers for Holyrood as a ‘panicky last-minute measure’.

He says he plans to keep the Queen as head of state, but the SNP’s John Mason is calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after the Queen steps down or dies.

Chancellor George Osborne, pictured, has announced an 11th hour guarantee to devolve further powers to Scotland over tax, spending, welfare and a host of other areas

Mr Cameron, at Balmoral yesterday with the Queen, was expected to reassure her that in the closing days of the campaign he intends to make the ‘emotional argument’ about all that England and Scotland have achieved together and what ‘we can continue to achieve’.

Sources have confirmed that the monarch will continue with her annual holiday at her private estate in the Highlands, on September 18. The Palace insisted that the Queen was politically neutral, but one well-placed source said: ‘You don’t have to be a genius to work out the Queen is a Unionist. Is the Pope a Catholic?’

A senior royal source was quoted as saying: ‘The Queen is a Unionist. Lots of people were telling us that it was going to be OK but there is now a great deal of concern.’

A Palace spokesman said: ‘The referendum is a matter for the people of Scotland: the Queen remains strictly neutral on this, as she does on all political issues. The Queen has maintained a close interest in the referendum as she does with all major matters of public debate and is being kept informed by her ministers and officials in the usual way.’
