The magic of the FA Cup isn't always as magical as supporters might like. But this year's fourth round had more than enough shocks to justify the cliché for another year at least.

Both of the Premier League's top two clubs were knocked out while Manchester United failed to score against minnows Cambridge United and Liverpool stumbled at home to Bolton Wanderers.

Here, Sportsmail's Matt Barlow looks back at the highs, lows, heroes and zeros.

ALL BETS OFF AS BRADFORD LEAD GIANT-KILLING PARADE 

It was much like most Sundays for Bradford City boss Phil Parkinson as he set out to watch son Jack play for Tockwith Juniors. But some things were certainly not normal in the North Yorkshire village.

There was the Sky Sports camera crew, for a start, and his phone buzzing continually with messages of congratulation. And an invitation to appear on Match of the Day 2.

This is what happens when your League One team knocks Chelsea out of the FA Cup, but Bradford’s was not the only surprise on a weekend when the Football League humbled the Premier League.

No-one saw it coming, except perhaps the 24-year-old Doncaster plumber who won nearly £3,000 with a tenner bet on Bradford and Middlesbrough.

Most wagers were destroyed by Bradford or Boro, winners at Man City, or Blackburn, who beat Swansea, or Bolton, who drew at Anfield, or Fulham, who held Sunderland, or Cambridge — who earned a replay against Manchester United.

Sheffield United’s FA Cup replay against Preston North End will be their 15th cup game of this season coming soon after the Capital One Cup semi-final, second leg against Tottenham on Wednesday — their seventh game in that competition. There have also been two games in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy, and the replay against Preston will be their sixth FA Cup match of the season. Defender Bob Harris has appeared in all 13 so far, starting a dozen and coming off the bench at Deepdale on Saturday. Harris has made 35 appearances already this season.

A PARTING SHOCK FROM PUNDIT WISE 

Is it Wig-an or is it Barnet? No, it’s former Wimbledon and Chelsea star Dennis Wise sporting an odd new hairdo when he appeared as a pundit on Ireland’s Setanta Sport. Twitter observers compared him to a character from The Lego Movie or Montgomery Burns from The Simpsons.

There were some cold spots amid their warm glow of affection for the famous old trophy. What was going on at Blackburn, for example, where fewer than 6,000 turned up for the lunchtime kick-off? Perhaps they stayed at home and picked it up on BBC Wales, but they missed the thrill of witnessing referee Craig Pawson take his red-card tally to seven in 15 games as two former Cardiff players, Rudy Gestede and Craig Conway, ended Swansea’s Cup hopes.

HERO

Phil Parkinson for having the courage to play open and aggressive football at Stamford Bridge and refusing to change tactics when Bradford went two down. His players responded to create one of the biggest FA Cup shocks ever but Parky, after leading his team to the Capital One Cup final, is proving once again that there are talented British coaches working in the Football League.

ZERO

Louis van Gaal for his sour response to Cambridge United’s heroics, moaning about the pitch, the referee, while refusing to acknowledge rival boss Richard Money. It was a sharp contrast to Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, who shared drinks with Bradford’s staff despite being choked by his defeat.

CAMBRIDGE HEROICS HELP FIRE UP THE FANS  

Cambridge United sparked all that weekend drama by resisting Manchester United on Friday. The goalless draw was watched live on BBC One by an armchair audience of more than seven million.

Then, more than 300,000 climbed off their sofas, pulled on hats and scarves and chicken costumes — whatever was to hand — to attend the 11 ties on Saturday, including some vast armies of travelling support.

Six thousand Bradford fans will never forget their day out at Chelsea, while the 5,500 West Brom fans who saw the latest instalment of Victor Anichebe’ s resurgence was apparently their largest away following in seven years.

Bolton provided 60 free coaches to ferry fans to Anfield, while nearly 6,000 Chesterfield supporters made the short trip south to Derby as almost 29,000 enjoyed the first county derby since 1986. It was a close-fought contest which proved football in Derbyshire is in rude health.

Cambridge, by the way, have been offered 9,000 tickets for next week’s replay at Old Trafford. It will be interesting to see if the Beeb stick with their story, or are tempted by possible upsets elsewhere, like Liverpool at Bolton or Sunderland at Fulham.

Garry Monk's decision to rest so many first-team regulars was perhaps the most puzzling decision of the weekend, though Swansea’s boss will feel his side would have won had they not been at least one man short for most of the game. None of the Capital One Cup semi-finalists won as they tinkered with rotation. Tottenham and Chelsea made nine changes and lost at home. Sheffield United and Liverpool drew, after making eight and five changes respectively.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce, fielding a full-strength XI at Bristol City, said the fourth round was ‘the most astounding weekend ever’ in FA Cup history.

BOGDAN TOPS WANTED LIST 

Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan produced a fabulous display at Anfield and his timing could barely have been better. Liverpool are one of the clubs monitoring Bogdan, aware that he is out of contract at the end of the season and resisting Bolton’s efforts to re-sign.

The 27-year-old Hungarian was making only his second appearance since August and he responded with an array of brilliant saves to frustrate Liverpool and secure a lucrative replay for the Championship club.

He has kept clean sheets in two FA Cup ties, which will alert more clubs to his availability on a free transfer in the summer. Several Bundesliga clubs had scouts in the Anfield crowd.

Bolton rejected a bid of £1.2million last summer from Mainz, who are still keen. Stuttgart and Hannover are also watching and there is interest from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, including Crystal Palace.
