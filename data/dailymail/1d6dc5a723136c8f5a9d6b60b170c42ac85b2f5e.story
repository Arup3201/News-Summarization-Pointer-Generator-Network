Tragic: Shaun Wilson-Miller, 17, has posted a heartbreaking video on to YouTube wishing an inspirational farewell to the world after doctors told him does not have long to live

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Terminally-ill Australian Shaun Wilson-Miller, 17, has become an internet sensation after accidentally posting a heartbreaking and inspirational farewell message to the world on YouTube.

Shaun, who has been told by doctors he does not have long left to live after his body rejected a SECOND heart transplant, was only trying to post his tragic goodbye speech to his friends on Facebook but due to a glitch had to put it on YouTube and woke up to find it had more than 10,000 views.

The Video, in which he shows no signs of self pity - instead encouraging watchers to seize the day and make the most of their lives - has now been viewed more than 1.3million times.

In his three-minute long 'My Final Goodbye' clip, after choking back tears, Shaun says: 'I won't be here as long as I thought, but I want to say that it's been an awesome ride and I have no regrets.

'Live life to the fullest because you never know what's going to happen.'

The video has inspired such a wave of emotion in his homeland that Shaun has spent his final weeks living out his dreams by appearing in Neighbours, meeting his favourite Aussie Rules football player, writing his memoirs - and even finding love.

Shaun's girlfriend is a fellow heart patient he started a relationship with three weeks ago but has been friends with for seven years.

'The hardest thing for me is leaving her, knowing that I won't get to marry her,' he told the Herald Sun in Australia.

'To have kids together. To grow old together. That is what makes sad.

He added: ' I want to have fun. I want to enjoy my life. The way I look at it is I didn't get to decide his. These are the cards I have been dealt. I just have to roll with the punches.

'I have had two heart transplants and a stent put in. I have had ten more years than I should have because of that. I want to go outwith a bang.'

His father Cameron admits the circumstances surrounding Shaun's death have left him bursting with pride at his boy's bravery - but utterly devastated he will have to bury his beloved son.

Cameron told the Herald Sun: 'I just pray that it's quick. I don't want him to suffer. No parent should have to bury their child. But he's just loving life and wants us to do the same. He doesn't want us to cry for him.

'I've become angry with the world, I question why this beautiful person should be taken way from me, from his family and from the world. But he doesn't want me to cry. He needs to know I'm going to be OK.'Â
