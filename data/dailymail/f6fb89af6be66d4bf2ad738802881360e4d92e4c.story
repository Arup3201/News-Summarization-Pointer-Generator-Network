We all indulge in a few wintry treats at Christmas.

There’s the plum pudding, the sticky mince pies – and this year, the seasonal fresh fruit.

An extraordinarily mild December has brought an unexpected crop of raspberries, while wild garlic is also starting to grow.

Mild: The relatively warm weather has encouraged raspberry bushes to grow fruit several months early; horticulturalist Steve England is pictured with a plant he found in Stoke Park, Bristol

Unusual: The plant was apparently 'tricked' into thinking that it was already spring

Gardener Steve England spotted a raspberry bush with red berries – and said more apples have stayed on the trees than usual.

He said: ‘We were stopped in our tracks when we saw a raspberry bush with lots of bright red fruits.

‘We all had a single refreshing  and tasty out-of-season raspberry, and went home full of the joys  of spring.

Delicious: Mr English enjoyed the out-of-season snack on his walk through a park in Bristol

Bud: This wild garlic was also growing, well in advance of when it would usually appear

‘The trees are also completely laden with apples – I’ve never seen anything like it.’

Mr England was leading a wildlife walk in Stoke Park in Bristol.

He
 said: ‘One of the first things we spotted was the Arum Lily, also 
called the Lords and Ladies, and it should be fast asleep at the moment.
 Then we came across some wild garlic beginning to grow.’

The amateur
 naturalist said that when cold does set in, it will have disastrous 
consequences because wildlife is ‘being tricked into thinking that 
spring has arrived early’.

He added: ‘Regardless of the time of year,
 as soon as the soil temperature reaches 16C (61F) and above, seeds will
 start to grow.

Harvest: An apple tree in Bristol was laden with fruit thanks to the unseasonable warmth

Orchard: The fruit has appeared because of the warmth of the soil, but will probably die again soon

‘Sadly when we do experience cold temperatures, and 
we will, the plants that have sprouted will be killed off by the frost. 
Then they will not re-grow until next spring.’

There have also been 
unseasonable reports of butterflies at Lower Way lakes in Thatcham, 
Berkshire. A small tortoiseshell and a yellow brimstone butterfly were 
spotted despite the native species normally hibernating until March.

A
 Met Office spokesman said the normal average maximum temperature for 
this time of year is 6.7C (44F) – but yesterday people in many areas saw
 temperatures of 12 to 13C (53 to 55F).

Ominous: This forecast by ECMWF predicts extremely low pressure above the UK on Christmas Day, which raises the possibility of stormy weather

Spray: The heavy rains prompted a Met Office weather warning due to the risk of flooding

The
 European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which has 
forecast a stormy Christmas, is a pan-European body for predicting the 
weather weeks in advance.

The
 organisation is backed by 20 European countries, including Britain, 
Ireland, France and Germany, and has its headquarters in Reading.

It
 was established in 1975 as a way of improving medium-term forecasts, 
which are generally much less reliable than short-term predictions.

The
 ECMWF releases 10-day forecasts every 12 hours, providing an early 
indication of weather conditions as well as warnings of extreme events.

Last
 year, the organisation predicted that Hurricane Sandy would hit 
landfall in the north-east of the U.S. seven days before it actually did
 so, enabling residents to protect themselves from the effects of the 
superstorm.

The spokesman said: ‘We are 
currently seeing milder temperatures, we will get some cold weather 
creeping in but that is likely to be short lived.

'It’s going to be a 
little up and down, with odd cold patches here and there, but in general
 the Christmas period should remain quite mild.’

Forecasters say Britain could be in for a stormy Christmas Day, however, with low atmospheric pressure bringing wind and rain.

A model by European forecaster ECMWF shows extremely low pressure over the UK on December 25, suggesting turbulent conditions.

Other forecasters said next week will be wet and windy.

Michael
 Dukes, of weather firm MetDesk, said: ‘It looks very much like it won’t
 be a white Christmas for most of us, with the possible exception of 
northern hills and mountains.

'It’s still a little too far off for much 
in the way of detail, but current indications are that the Christmas 
period will be very unsettled and often wet or stormy.’

The Met 
Office said Christmas week was likely to be ‘unsettled’, but emphasised 
that it is not yet possible to say exactly what the weather will be like
 on each day.

This weekend will be ‘unsettled and breezy’, it said, 
with ‘showery and wintery conditions expected to affect most parts of 
the UK’.
