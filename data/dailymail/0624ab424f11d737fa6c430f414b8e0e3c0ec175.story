Adult TV star: Sophie Dalzell, 19, was hauled before a court for kicking two police officers

An adult television model let off wearing an electronic tag because it would ruin her on-screen work has been hauled before a court again for attacking two police officers while drunk.

Sophie Dalzell, 19, said she was 'provoked' into kicking the officers during a night out in her hometown of Workington, Cumbria

The adult TV model, who wore a bright pink tracksuit to court, had denied the assaults but was found guilty by magistrates.

Cynthia Ray, chairman of the 
magistrates in Workington, said Dalzell used her foot as a weapon and 
the only mitigation was that just two blows were struck.

But speaking outside the court, 
Sophie claimed the incident had arisen because she had been ‘provoked’ 
by others jealous of her lifestyle.

She claimed: 'I just keep getting 
provoked. Basically, they’re jealous that I’ve got out of Cumbria and 
I’ve done something with my life.

'Modelling is just something I fell 
into and thoroughly enjoy. But what I really want to do is TV 
presenting. I’ve been on one course, but I want to go on a longer one.'

She was ordered to attend a Thinking Skills course and given a community order. She was also told to pay more than £1,000 costs and compensation to the officers.

Just
last month Dalzell, of north Manchester, appeared in court after refusing to be fitted with 
an electronic tag on her ankle because 'appearance is everything' on 
Adult TV.

Incredibly, when the presenter was 
hauled back to court, she successfully appealed against having the tag 
fitted after explaining it would compromise her career.

Instead magistrates in Manchester fined the glamour model £200 with £75 costs after she admitted breaching a community order.

After the case the model, who has appeared topless in men’s magazines, said: ‘A tag on my ankle wouldn’t look very good. It’s an eyesore. Your appearance is everything. I’m still mad about the whole situation.’

Magistrates were told she no longer works in adult TV and has moved into modelling, photo shoots, hosting and other presenting jobs.
