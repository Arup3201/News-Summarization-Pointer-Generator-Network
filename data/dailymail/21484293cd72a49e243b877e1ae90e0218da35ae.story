Bill Clinton's mistress has been nicknamed 'Energizer' by his security staff, a new book alleges.

Richard JoRonald Kessler's 'The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of Presidents,' excerpts of which were obtained by the New York Post's Richard Johnson, makes the claim.

One excerpt includes a quote from a source that revealed 'Energizer' has no problem getting inside the Clintons' Chappaqua, New York home.

Keeping a secret? A new book claims that Bill Clinton has a mistress nicknamed 'Energizer' by his security staff

'You don’t stop her, you don’t approach her, you just let her go in,' the source said.

The former president's other woman has 'very perky' augmented breasts, another source alleged in quotes shared by the newspaper.

'It was a warm day, and she was wearing a low-cut tank top, and as she leaned over, her breasts were very exposed,' the security source said of the mysterious mistress. 'They appeared to be very perky and very new and full... There was no doubt in my mind they were enhanced.'

Though information on Clinton's alleged ladylove is scant, the newspaper reported she is blond and gave cookies to the Secret Service.

Not so nice: A book claims that 'agents consider being assigned to [Hillary Clinton's] detail a form of punishment'

The Post also reported that both Bill and Hillary's security officers work together to hide 'Energizer' from Hillary.

Requests for comment to both Clintons' press offices regarding the book's allegations were not immediately returned.

Kessler's book claims 'Because [Hillary] is so nasty to agents and hostile to law enforcement officers and military officers in general, agents consider being assigned to her detail a form of punishment,' according to the Post.

Former President Clinton famously had an affair with
 White House intern Monica Lewinsky in 1995, which later led to a televised apology to the American public in 1998.

Lewsinky, speaking to Time magazine in 1999, called the relationship with the president 'definitely inappropriate.'

'It was definitely inappropriate,' she said. 'And the way he was flirting with me was inappropriate. So I think was the eye contact. And the way he looks at women he’s attracted to.

'He undresses you with his eyes. And it is slow, from the bottom of your toes to the top of your head back down to your toes again. And it’s an intense look. He loses his smile. His sexual energy kind of comes over his eyes, and it’s very animalistic. And if you’re someone who is comfortable with your sensuality, you’re in touch with that, you’re receptive to it if you find that person attractive.'

Clinton also has admitted to having extramarital sex with Gennifer Flowers.

Dolly Kyle Browning also said in a 1998 declaration that she had multiple sexual encounters with Clinton from the 1970s through 1992.

'The 
frequency of our contact with each other, and the frequency of our 
sexual encounters, varied over that time period, but we did have sexual 
relations many times during that time period,' she said.

Browning claimed Clinton ended the affair and said 'If you cooperate with the media we will destroy you.'

Clinton also allegedly had a one-night stand with former Miss America Elizbeth Ward Gracen.

Kessler's book will be published August 5 and will included 'stories that will makes headlines about our nation's leaders and the agency sworn to protect them,' a publicity synopsis claims.
