A California zoo is believed to be the first in the world to give its penguin residents access to an iPad.

Staff at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach let two it its Magellanic penguins, Jeremy and Newson, play on an iPad game originally designed for cats.

The team were astonished when the birds instantly took to the game, chasing an on-screen mouse and managing to score highly on the game by tapping their beaks on the screen.

Magellanic Penguins were named after the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was the first to sail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean in the mid-1500s through what is now called the Strait of Magellan.

They build their nests during the breeding season along the rocky, sandy beaches of the southern coasts of Argentina and Chile and on the Falkland Islands.

A temperate species, Magellanic Penguins are usually about two to two-and-a-half feet tall and weigh between six and fifteen pounds when fully grown.

The zoo is trialling the iPad game with its Magellanic penguins, some of which were rescued from Brazil where they were stranded outside their native habitat.

Zoo volunteer Hugo Ryono had the idea after a discussion with keepers about the iPad app 'Game for Cats' and wondering if it could be used as an enrichment aid for the penguins.

'Just like cats penguins are very 
curious and the idea of these birds following a virtual mouse on a 
screen was just too appealing to me not to try out.Â 

'Dusting off my old iPad 1 and loading Game for Cats app on it we set up a penguin video arcade in the exhibit last week.'

'Sure enough when Jeremy and Newsom 
noticed the iPad in the exhibit they both waddled on over. Jeremy was 
the first to try it out but Newsom was the one that really got into it.

'Stalking the virtual mouse intently he tried to pick it up repeatedly with his beak.

'Newsom especially seemed to like the squeak that the mouse made when he put his beak on the virtual critter.

'The mouse was self reinforcing for this penguin.

'Newsom set the penguin high score of 1600 for the game.'

Newsom, the second penguin to try the game. He set the highest score, with 1600 points, by chasing a mouse of screen with his beak
