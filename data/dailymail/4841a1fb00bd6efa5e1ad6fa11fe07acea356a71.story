A decomposed body found off a rural road in upstate New York 30 years ago has finally been identified as belonging to an aspiring model who vanished as she headed to New York City.

The body found by a hunter in Shelby, New York in October 1983 has now been identified as Shari Lynne Ball, a 20-year-old woman who disappeared after leaving Boca Raton, Florida.

After the body was found, it was badly decomposed and could not be identified so was buried beneath a tombstone reading 'Jane Doe'.

But cold-case investigators, working with local authorities, requested that the body be exhumed from its grave in October last year and compared with samples in the National DNA Database.

Found: Shari Lynne Ball, pictured, vanished in 1983 as she traveled from Florida to New York to pursue a modeling career. A body found four months later in upstate New York has now been identified as hers

There was a match; Ball's mother had provided a sample in 2005, the Sun Sentinel reported.

Ball was just 20 when she left her home in Boca Raton on June 27, 1983 and told relatives she was heading north to pursue a modeling career.

Two days later, she called a friend from a truck stop in Ashland, Virginia - the last time anyone heard from her.

Four months later, in October 1983, a hunter discovered a body in Shelby, Orleans County, New York - nearly 400 miles northwest of New York City, and more than 1,300 miles from her Florida home.

But with the body so badly decomposed, she could not be identified, and Ball was declared legally dead in 1988, as her family continued to wonder what had happened to her.

Police say they suspect foul play may have been involved in her death, but could not provide further details.

Investigators have traveled to Ball's mother's house to notify her in person that her daughter's body had been found, Lt. Kevin Reyes with the New York State Police told the Sentinel.

'It did give her closure in knowing that she does know exactly what has happened to her daughter... as opposed to it being a mystery,' he said.

Records show that Ball's mother, Nancy, had first called police on the night she left before calling again in October 1983, saying no one had seen her daughter for months.

But a report was filed saying no foul play was suspected because she was an adult who had left of her own accord. It also noted that Ball and her mother had difficulties in their relationship.

Reyes said detectives will now try to establish a timeline of events leading up to her death and start interviewing people who knew her.

'Similarities': Christopher Wilder's name has been mentioned although not directly linked to the case, investigators said. Wilder was known as the Beauty Queen Killer for murdering beautiful women in 1984

He added that the name of one serial killer had been brought up - Christopher Wilder, who became known as The Beauty Queen Killer, for killing and raping women in Florida in 1984, and one of his victims was raped and stabbed in upstate New York.

He was killed in a confrontation with police in April 1984.

'The name has been brought up, but we have no evidence as of yet to link this individual to this disappearance,' Reyes said of Wilder.

Ball was 20 years old, white, 5ft4, 100
 pounds, with hazel eyes and blonde hair and was also known to use the 
name of Timmerman when she disappeared, police say.

Anyone who knew her or who may be able to provide information is urged to contact New 
York State Police at 585-344-6210.
