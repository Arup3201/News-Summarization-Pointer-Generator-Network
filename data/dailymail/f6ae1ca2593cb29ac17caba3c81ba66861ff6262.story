Four men have been charged over the shooting death of a five-year-old girl who was hit by a stray bullet while eating breakfast in her family's Omaha home.

Payton Benson was the innocent victim of violent gun battle between rival gangs about a block from her Emmet St duplex on January 15.

While the bullet that killed Payton has not been found, investigators believe the murder weapon was fired by 20-year-old Vincent Hicks.

Charged: Adonus Moses, 22 (left) was booked on suspicion of criminal conspiracy to commit second-degree murder and Vincent Hicks, 20 (right) was booked on suspicion of first-degree murder

Charged: Jacob Brown, 21 (left) and Jaylen Brown, 18 (right) were booked on suspicion of discharging a firearm and using a weapon to commit a felony

Omaha.com reported Hicks, from Omaha, was charged today with first-degree murder under a legal theory called transferred intent - that Hicks intended to kill someone when the bullet struck Payton.

Police also arrested three other men who were in the Jeep.

Adonus Moses, 22, was charged with conspiracy to commit second-degree murder.

Jaylen Montgomery, 18, and Jacob J. Brown, 21, were booked on suspicion of discharging a firearm at an occupied dwelling and use of a weapon to commit a felony.

Police believed their car was chasing a rival gang member in rival gang territory before at least three of the men got out of the vehicle and opened fire.

Senseless: Payton Benson, five, was shot dead by a stray bullet as she ate breakfast on January 15

The Wichita Eagle reported the men had initially been arrested on suspicion of theft in connection with the stolen Jeep seen on surveillance video.

But police began to piece together the morning's events through input from the community.

'These arrests are the product of a community that has stepped forward to assist law enforcement, coupled with gang and homicide detectives that have worked tirelessly to solve this case,' Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said in a written statement.

At the time of the shooting, witnesses told WOWT they heard at least 20 shots fired from multiple high-powered rifles.

‘What I heard was just massive amounts of gunfire, both guns had to be completely unloaded,’ Nick Todd said. ‘Both guns were very large guns. They weren't small guns.’

Even worse, the family’s van had a flat tire after being struck by a separate stray bullet – Ms Benson’s mother could not get her to the hospital in time to possibly save her life.

The Fontenelle Park neighborhood, where 
the shootings occurred, is not a particularly violent area. There are 
only four violent crimes per 1,000 residents, according to the Omaha World-Herald.

The suspects: Police released surveillance footage showing at least three men getting out of the stolen Jeep

The getaway: Cops believe the men sped away in this vehicle

Callous: the stray bullets even flattened the tires of the family van, making it impossible to rush the dying girl to the hospital
