Collapse: Labour MP Paul Goggins was rushed to hospital after suffering a stroke while out jogging

Former Labour minister Paul Goggins was seriously ill in hospital last night after collapsing from a stroke while out jogging.

The Wythenshawe and Sale East MP was running with his son near his Manchester home yesterday when he fell ill.

He underwent emergency surgery and his wife Wyn and three children were at his bedside last night.

Party leader Ed Miliband said Mr Goggins, 60, pictured, was ‘one of the most decent, kind and assiduous members of Parliament’.

He added: ‘The news of his stroke is a huge shock. All of my good wishes and the thoughts of our whole party are with him and his family.’

The MP is being treated at the Salford Royal Hospital with his wife Wyn and three grown-up children at his bedside.

In a statement, his family said: 'Yesterday, December 30, Paul Goggins MP was taken ill while out running with his son near his home.

'He was taken by ambulance to Salford Royal, where he remains seriously ill.

'He is receiving the best care. His family are with him and ask for prayers and privacy.'

Labour MP Lucy Powell wrote on Twitter: 'All my thoughts are with Paul Goggins and his family. I very much hope for his speedy recovery. He is a really decent, genuine person.'

And Barbara Keeley posted: 'Prayers & thoughts with Wyn and the Goggins family - so sorry to hear of Paul’s sudden illness.'

Mr Goggins was first elected to Parliament in 1997 and has held his seat ever since.
