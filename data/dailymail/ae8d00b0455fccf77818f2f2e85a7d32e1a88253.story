The president of Germany has decorated the nation's World Cup-winning squad with the country's highest honour for sports, after their tournament victory in Brazil this summer.

President Joachim Gauck, joined by Chancellor Angela Merkel, presented the players with the Silver Laurel Leaf in a ceremony at the head of state's Bellevue Palace after describing their efforts in South America as a 'convincing performance that is recognised ungrudgingly by all its opponents.' 

Speaking a day after the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gauck noted that Germany's fourth World Cup is its first as a reunited nation - with West Germany winning the title shortly before reunification in 1990.

World Cup winning captain Philipp Lahm, who retired from the national team after the tournament, thanked Gauck and Merkel for their support. 

Both traveled to the World Cup and visited the Germany dressing room, with Merkel posing for a selfie with Lukas Podolski after their victory against Argentina in the final.

Podolski, who has over 100 caps for Germany, has been named in coach's Joachim Low squad for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar and international friendly against Spain this week, but Andre Schurrle misses out.

The Chelsea forward has failed to recover from a nagging infection that has led him to miss a significant amount of training in recent weeks.

As a result the 24-year-old was unable to travel to his homeland for Monday's award ceremony at the German Presidency.

'Schurrle suffered a persistent infection in October and could not train regularly,' the German national team said in a statement.

'It was agreed with coach Joachim Low that he stays in London and trains individually to optimise his fitness.'

Despite Schurrle's absence Low has decided not to call up a replacement. 

Germany, who will also attend the premiere of their World Cup movie in Berlin on Monday, face Gibraltar in Nuremberg on Friday before travelling to Spain to take on the former World Cup winners in a friendly on November 18.
