The first female pilots to join the Chinese equivalent of the Red Arrows could put on a display in the UK this summer.

Organisers of the Royal International Air Tattoo have asked the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force to participate at the annual show  in Gloucestershire, and are hopeful they might send the Bayi Aerobatic Team to put on a display.

A spokesman, for the world's biggest military airshow said an appearance by the team would be one of the most 'eagerly anticipated performances ever', which is on the weekend of July 17 to 19, 2015.

It comes as Yu Xu, Tao Jiali, Sheng Yifei and He Xiaoli are set to make their overseas debut at the Langkawi International Maritime & Aerospace Exhibition in Malaysia next week, reports People's Daily Online. 

The women each have more than 800 hours of flying training under their belt, across the use of four different types of aircraft. 

The Chinese military have said that these are the only four women pilots in China capable of navigating the third generation of jet fighters now being used.

Airshow co-ordinators at the UK event, which attracts thousands of aviation enthusiasts to the two-day event at RAF Fairford each year, said they would be welcome on the bill.

Spokesman Richard Arquati said: 'Having extended an invitation to the PLAAF we would be delighted if they accepted and agreed to send their Bayi Aerobatic Team.

'The team would certainly receive a huge and very warm reception from the thousands of aircraft enthusiasts who attend our event and for whom such an addition to the flying display would prove one of the most eagerly anticipated performances at a UK airshow - ever.' 

The four women took part in a high-profile military parade marking the People's Republic of China's 60th anniversary in 2009.

They also performed with J-10 fighters at the 10th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, last November.

It is not yet known whether the PLA will accept the invitation and who they will send if they do agree to send any aircraft.

The Air Force acrobatic team gave its first overseas performance at the Moscow air show in 2013.
