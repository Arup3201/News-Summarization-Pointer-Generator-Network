Two fraudsters who stole more than £1million from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in a taxi expenses scam have been told they need only pay back £300,000.

Lisa Burrows, 41, and Tahir Mahmood, 50, worked for the state prosecutor in the West Midlands, and stole money from their employer by billing fake taxi journeys for court witnesses to their own bank accounts.

They spent the money paying down a huge chunk of the mortgage on a house, while splurging on designer clothes and upmarket hotels in Dubai.

Both of pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position in Birmingham Crown Court last March and given six year prison sentences for taking a total of £1,147,101.

It was discovered the swindlers were still sitting on £600,000 of taxpayers' money on their first day in prison.

Shortly after they were imprisoned it emerged that the two were still holding around £600,000 of the haul - but a court hearing designed to recover the money for the public purse offered them a more lenient repayment.

Burrows, a former finance manager at the CPS, was ordered to repay £73,213 by January 1 or have her sentence lengthened by 18 months.

Mahmood, a junior member of staff in Burrows' office who was also her lover, was told to return £233,991 by January or have his sentenced extended by two years.

During the fraud - which continued for five years - he had operated the bank account, withdrawing money which had been fraudulently sent to bogus company B&M Taxis.

The company - named after Burrows and Mahmood themselves - supposedly ferried witnesses to and from court cases, but in fact the journeys were invented and the cash spent on high living.

Brett Wilson, defending, said both of his clients would have to sell properties to pay back the cash during the hearing at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday.

He added: 'For Mr Mahmood, while there is some cash that can be used and some from a sale of a property, it does leave him a balance to find from either borrowing or the sale of another property.'

Burrows, of Oldbury, and Mahmood, of Hodge Hill, accused each other of launching the scam after they met in 2008.

When they were sentenced originally, Judge Davis QC condemned the pair for the serious breach of public trust, saying they were driven by 'pure greed'.

He said: 'That money went on high living – expensive holidays in Dubai and New York, designer clothing, jewellery... It is difficult to envisage a more serious fraud of its type that the one you committed.'
