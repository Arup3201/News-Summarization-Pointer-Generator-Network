Graphic: Edward Atkinson, 81, sent anti-abortion material to the chief executive of a Norfolk hospital

An 81-year-old pro-life campaigner who sent graphic anti-abortion material to a new hospital boss has been given a three month suspended jail term.

Edward Atkinson sent a letter and disturbing images to Patricia Wright, the new chief executive of King's Lynn Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Norfolk.

But the package was opened by a young female member of staff at the hospital, who was left 'distressed' and upset by its graphic contents.

Norwich Crown Court was told it was the third time the 81-year-old activist had breached an ASBO banning him from sending abortion-related material to any person, hospital, doctor, medical practice or public authority.

The ban was imposed on life-long anti-abortion campaigner Atkinson, who lives in Hilgay, near Downham Market, in 2006.

The hospital had previously been flooded with thousands of angry letters containing similarly explicit material from Atkinson's supporters in the U.S. after he last went on the warpath over abortion.

Atkinson admitted breaching the order at court on Monday and was given a three-month jail term, suspended for 18 months.

The ASBO was extended until March 2017 and he was given a three-month curfew.

Judge Nicholas Coleman accepted Atkinson had been a life-long activist against abortion but said he had to comply with the order however much he disagreed with it.

He warned the pensioner that if he breached it he would be jailed.

'If you commit an offence in the future this sentence will take effect,' Judge Coleman said.

Julianna Tolan, defending, said Atkinson now realised there were other ways of putting his views across.

'There are legal ways he can protest which would ensure he would not come before the courts again,' she said.

She said the pensioner had wanted to make contact with the new chief executive as he was also aggrieved that his ban meant he could not get his hip replacement carried out at Queen Elizabeth Hospital but had to go elsewhere.

Target: The pensioner sent a package of extreme anti-abortion material to King's Lynn Queen Elizabeth Hospital

Miss Tolan said the package Atkinson sent to the hospital had carried a warning stating that it was not to be opened by anyone who might be offended by the material.

'It was not his intention to cause alarm,' she said.

'The envelope was clearly marked.'

'No one deserves to be on the receiving end of hate mail'

Hospital spokesman

After the case Atkinson said that the sentence would not stop him battling to outlaw abortions.

'I am not going to stop until the scourge of abortion has been lifted from our law,' he said.

Atkinson was supported in court by Victoria Gillick, 65, a long-time campaigner against under-age sex.

The mother-of-10 said she was supporting him because no law was above criticism.

Mrs Gillick, of Fenland Life Supporter Group, said: 'It felt like a sick joke to see someone like Ted at his age and infirmity threatened with jail.'

Speaking after Atkinson was sentenced, a Queen Elizabeth Hospital spokesman said: 'This mail was opened by members of our administration staff who found it very disturbing and upsetting.

'Following an earlier case some years ago we were inundated with extremist mail from around the world.'

'All this had to be processed and responses provided, which used valuable public time and money.'

'The more extreme letters were referred to the police and appropriate action was taken.'

'No one deserves to be on the receiving end of hate mail.

'We will always take any steps necessary to enforce the NHS policy of zero tolerance in cases where the safety and well-being of our staff is under threat.'
