Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse has revealed he has held discussions about his future and that Swansea are among potential suitors after a fee was agreed with Manchester City for the sale of Wilfried Bony.

Cisse could become a potential replacement for Bony after a £25million fee with £3m add-ons was agreed for the striker to join the Barclays Premier League champions.

'I have one-and-a-half years left on my contract,' Cisse told The Chronicle. 'Today I focus on the African Cup of Nations, then we will see how things will evolve and my future with Newcastle. We talk about a lot of clubs, Swansea and others.'

Swansea publicly maintain they will not try to sign a striker during the January transfer window, however.

The Welsh club insist they are not in the market because they signed Bafetimbi Gomis as a free agent in June and brought in Nelson Oliveira on loan from Benfica in December.

But Gomis fuelled speculation he could leave Swansea after revealing he was flattered to have clubs asking about his availability.

The 29-year-old claimed a 'very big club' wanted him, that he is after Champions League football and that 'it is nice to hear' from other clubs.

Bony's deal with City is understood to be worth £25m plus a further £3m if they win the Premier League, Champions League or FA Cup during his contract. 

The striker would have to play in 60 per cent of their matches in those competitions to qualify.
