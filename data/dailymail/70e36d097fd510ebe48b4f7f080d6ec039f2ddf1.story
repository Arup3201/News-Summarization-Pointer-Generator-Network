England prop David Wilson has been ruled out of the RBS 6 Nations tournament due to a neck injury, coach Stuart Lancaster has announced.

The 29-year-old Bath tighthead will miss England's remaining four fixtures and will be sidelined for up to three months.

Wilson will, however, be back in time for the World Cup training camp.

David Wilson has been ruled out of the Six Nations with a neck injury, Stuart Lancaster has confirmed

The Bath prop missed the opening win against Wales at the Millennium Stadium last week

'David has seen the specialist and will be out for the Six Nations,' Lancaster said.

'He's booked in for an operation tomorrow that will relieve his nerve impingement. He'll be out for 10-12 weeks.'

Wilson missed England's tournament opener against Wales - a 21-16 victory at the Millennium Stadium - due to the injury.

The nerve problem is similar to the one that has ruled lock Joe Launchbury out of the entire competition.

England have been hit with a host of injuries ahead of the Six Nations, with Wilson the ninth member of the squad to suffer a problem leading to a lay-off.

England have been plagued by injuries this year, with Henry Launchbury also out with a similar injury

While centre Brad Barritt and second row Geoff Parling could both return at some point during the series after both suffering knee ligament injuries, six others have either been ruled out or do not have an expected return date.

Fly-half Owen Farrell suffered a left knee ligament injury during Saracens' European Champions Cup defeat at Clermont and is out of the entire Six Nations while number eight Ben Morgan had ankle surgery after being carried off against Saracens last month and is also out, along with Launchberry.

Powerful centre Manu Tuilagi is unavailable due to a chronic groin condition he first suffered in October while Kyle Eastmond aggravated a shoulder in the final weekend of European club action and no date has been set for his return.

Finally, Northampton flanker Tom Wood injured his ankle against Racing Metro and while he did not require surgery, it is unknown when he will return.
