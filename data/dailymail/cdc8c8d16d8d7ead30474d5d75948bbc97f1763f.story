Andres Iniesta believes Barcelona face a summer of upheaval after suffering La Liga heartbreak in the title decider with Atletico Madrid.

Barca failed to claim the win they needed to take the championship as a 1-1 draw left Atletico celebrating in the Nou Camp.

All change: Midfielder Andres Iniesta expects a few comings and goings at Barcelona this summer

hard to take: Iniesta leaves the Nou Camp pitch after Barcelona's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid

Coach Gerardo Martino confirmed he was leaving after a trophyless season and legendary defender Carles Puyol is on his way.

Iniesta, who signed a deal in December to take him through to 2018, expects to see more changes.

He said: ‘We were relying on winning this game. We haven’t and that makes this season disappointing, because if we had won, everything would be different.

‘The season is over, lots of things are over.’
