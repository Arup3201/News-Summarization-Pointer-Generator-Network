If you thought airport security was bad enough – be warned that it’s about to get a whole lot tougher.

New covert scanners designed to detect radioactive ‘dirty bombs’ and DIY biological weapons are to be introduced in airports disguised as queue barriers.

The latest technology - the workings of which remains a secret - look like typical barrier poles which are linked together by roll-out ribbons, used to guide queuing passengers through departure lounges into security.

Security controls at airports  have been stepped up in the last decade, with body scanners, such as this one in Germany's Hamburg airport, showing full body images

The scanners are among a display of the latest new security equipment being showcased at the week-long Farnborough International Air Show where organisers have created a realistic mock-up check-in security zone and departure lounge containing the new devices.

It is the latest technology – much of it still secret –  developed to help combat the anticipated growing terror threat in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics and beyond.

The airport security stand allows the show’s expected quarter of a million visitors  to experience a practical ‘walk-through’ test of new technology from the moment a passenger arrives at check-in to deposit hold luggage before going through security with or without carry-on hand baggage.

The radiation detectors are an example of some of the most sophisticated technology to be developed for security purposes.

They scan unwary passengers for traces of radioactivity to deter attacks from a ‘dirty bomb’ whose contamination effects could last for years.

The radiation detection unit sits near the top of the 3ft high 2.5 inch diameter pole,  just beneath the roll-out extendable belt mechanism. The battery to power it sits in the weighted base.

It can send warnings wirelessly via wi-fi to a central control unit. Poles can be linked via wi-fi to track a suspect emitting radiation. The poles can also be hard-wired in using an Ethernet cable from under the floor.

Full body scans are now a common addition to security controls at international airports

The time taken to detect and identify radioactive traces on people or in packages can range from a few seconds to 20 to 30 seconds, depending on the type of radioactive isotope being checked.

The covert barrier-pole detectors, called ‘Stride’, are produced by security firm FLIR which is also responsible for the mock-up airport lounge in which they feature.

Publicity material for the devices notes: ‘The covert movement of special nuclear material or weapons into populated areas represents possibly the greatest threat to  the security of our world.

‘Identification systems are required to effectively detect and deter this threat. They must recognise the presence or movement of radioactive materials across borders.’

A Farnborough International Air Show spokesman said: ‘These disguised poles or bollards monitor passengers for traces of radiation, scanning them for nuclear material, components or weaponry

‘The main risk is radioactive materials which may be used to contaminate an area or combined with conventional explosives to create a so-called ‘dirty bomb.'

He said the scanners detect and nuclear or radioactive material which might be used to make a so-called dirty bomb which could shut down an airport and contaminate it for years.

Once they detect radioactivity an alarm goes off on the central control centre.

Steve Williams, business development officer for FLIR said: 'The poles can alert security forces to the fact that someone is carrying traces of radioactive materials through an airport. Working together, they can also track them.'

He said the sensors are so sensitive they can even tell whether a person has had radiation treatment, such as in a hospital, to potentially eliminate them from suspicion.

Technology to combat a potentially deadly biological threat is also on display on the FLIR stand. Aerosol detectors monitor the airport’s air for airborne biological  threats such as anthrax, plague bacteria, smallpox viruses or deadly ricin poison.

If detected, the system immediately shuts down the air conditioning system and seals of rooms and lounges to contain the toxic threat and prevent it spreading across an entire airport or being carried onto planes while decontamination takes place.

Also on show in the mock-up airport security lounge are:

The lounge also includes a special ‘command and control’ centre which collects data and images  from all the scanners, cameras and radar detectors, giving overview of whole airport security.

There are even details of new hi-tech cameras mounted on the perimeter of airport and even  in the sky on planes monitoring the ground below.

Full-body scanners were introduced in 2010 and now the next-generation of scanner are being showcased at Farnborough

The Farnborough International Airshow spokesman said: ‘Airport security and immigration issues are back at the top of the agenda as unprecedented numbers of visitors will descend on London for the Olympic Games over the next few weeks, testing airport security systems to the maximum.

‘The very latest cutting edge detection and surveillance technology, due to be installed at major airports around the world in the coming years, will be on show this week at  Farnborough. These innovations will shape everyone’s experience of air travel for years to come.’

All such devices undergo testing by government authorities before being approved for use in UK airports.

More than 250,000 people are expected to attend the Farnborough air show including airline and aircraft industry bosses, space agencies such as NASA and European Space Agency, military, and the general public at the weekend only

It also marks the UK debut of  a mock-up of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic Space Ship 2 which aims to put civilians into space. The show  runs until Friday for trade visitors  and is open to the public on Saturday and Sunday. Details at www.farnborough.com
