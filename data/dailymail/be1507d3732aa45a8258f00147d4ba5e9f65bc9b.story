The Life, Family and Freedom Conference, due to be held on Saturday August 30, is being run by Illinois-based organisation the World Congress of Families

A group of 80 conservative religious leaders have written an open letter to the people of Australia pleading for them to allow an anti-gay conference in Melbourne go ahead.

The Life, Family and Freedom Conference, due to be held on Saturday August 30, has had its venue cancelled four times by venue owners and is scrambling to find a place that will host it.

The 'pro natural family' conference is being run by Illinois-based organisation the World Congress of Families (WCF) and is sponsored by Australian Christian organisation Endeavour Forum.

In the letter, 80 religion leaders from around the world blame a smear campaign launched by 'sexual radicals' for the repeated cancellation of the event.

'It is alleged that advocacy of the natural (or normative) family is somehow unfair to other families and that we “shame” single-parent families, homosexual “couples” and the divorced,' the letter reads.

'Yet social science data shows clearly and unequivocally that children do best in families with a mother and father.'

Speakers listed on the event's brochure include Federal Minister for Social Services Kevin Andrews, Victorian Attorney-General Robert Clark and NSW Christian Democrats MP Reverend Fred Nile.

Since 1997, WCF has held seven congresses in Prague, Geneva, Mexico City, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Madrid and Sydney in 2013

Also due to speak is controversial doctor Angela Lanfranchi from the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute who will give a talk on 'The link between abortion and breast cancer'.

Earlier this month Senator Eric Abetz was slammed after he spoke on Channel Ten's The Project and appeared to back up Dr Lanfrachi's assertion that abortions lead to breast cancer by citing 1950s research.

He later made a statement denying he had made the link, saying he had been 'cut off' before he could fully answer the question.

The WCF's open letter also states attacks on the Melbourne conference and the international pro-family movement are an attempt at 'intimidation'.

'The goal of sexual radicals is to deconstruct marriage and marginalize the family, and thus to transform society into something unrecognizable to generations past,' the letter says.

Among the Australian signatories are Rabbi Dr Shimon Cowen, director of the Institute for Judaism and Civilization and Warwick March from the Dads4Kids Fatherhood Foundation.

The conference was due to be held at St Patrick's Parish Hall in Mentone, south-east Melbourne, before venue owners cancelled due to concerns about the safety of the nearby school and church.

It was then rescheduled to be held at St Cecilia's Hall in Glen Iris and Aurora Receptions in Brunswick but both venue owners also cancelled.

Organisers said a fourth unnamed venue had also pulled out.

'It’s a mess,' Margaret Butts told Guardian Australia.

'We have no venue at the moment – the police are telling us it's a safety risk because of planned protests and demonstrations.'

Simon Hunt, who runs the Pauline Pantsdown Facebook page, has been leading a social media campaign against the event.

A 'Block Party Against Hate' is being also organised by protesters to take place outside the conference.

'There will be art and music, and lots of like-minded people celebrating inclusion and diversity,' the Facebook event page reads.

Event sponsor the Endeavour Forum describes itself as a Christian, pro-life, pro-family Australian non-government organisation which was founded to counter feminism, defend the right to life of the unborn and support marriage and the natural family.

The WCF, based in Illinois in the US, is connected to the pro-family research body the Howard Centre.

Since 1997, WCF has held seven congresses in Prague, Geneva, Mexico City, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Madrid and Sydney.
