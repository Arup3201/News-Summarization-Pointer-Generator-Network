Nearly a decade before Amanda Berry was found alive in the home of her alleged abductor, the young woman's mother went on The Montel Williams Show and was told in no uncertain terms by a celebrity psychic that he daughter was dead.

Self-described medium and spiritual teacher Sylvia Browne told Berry's mother, Louwanna Miller, on a 2004 episode that Amanda, who went missing the year before, was no longer among the living, causing the desperate mother to break down in tears.

'She's not alive, honey,' Browne told Miller on the show, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.'

Hope lost: Browne (left) told Miller (right) that her daughter was 'not alive' that that she would see her in heaven, leaving the mother '98 per cent' sure that the medium was right  

Browne added that she would only see her daughter 'in heaven, on the other side.'

Amanda Berry, now 26, escaped from the basement of a Cleveland home on Monday night with Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, who all disappeared from the same block ten years ago.

They were found with a six-year-old girl, who relatives confirmed Amanda gave birth to while held against her will at the home for a decade.

Amanda went missing on April 21, 2003, on the eve of her 17th birthday shortly after she called her sister to say that she was getting a ride home from her job at Burger King.

On Monday night, Amanda had a smile on her face as she hugged her weeping sister Beth as the pair were reunited for the first time in a decade following her decade in captivity in the home of Ariel Castro.

The kidnapping victim also introduced her sister to her daughter, who was born during the 10-year ordeal.

After 19 months of refusing to accept that her daughter was dead, Miller was finally forced to face what she believed at the time to be the awful truth.

The grieving mother gave away her daughter's computer and took down her pictures.

'I'm not even buying my baby a Christmas present this year,' she told the paper.

Miller was devastated by what she heard on the nationally syndicated talk show, but said that she believed '98 per cent' in Browne.

The mother said after her on-screen conversation with Sylvia Browne that while she wanted to hold on to hope that Amanda was still alive, after a year-and-a-half without any breaks in the investigation, she had little to go on.

'It seems like the God-honest truth. My daughter would always call home,' Miller said.

The FBI and police working on the missing person case were skeptical of the psychic's verdict, saying they will consider Amanda Berry was alive until her body and evidence proving that she was dead is found.

House of horrors: Amanda Berry was freed along with two other women from this home in Cleveland, Ohio, where the three had been held captive for 10 years

Louwanna Miller died at age 44 from a heart failure and a host of other ailments a little more than a year after her 2004 encounter with Sylvia Browne. Miller had spent three years searching for her daughter, during which time those who knew her said the woman’s health had deteriorated.

On Monday, Amanda Berry was discovered alive after she managed to escape from the Cleveland home of a man she said had kept her in captivity for the past 10 years along with two other young women.      

Those who knew Mrs Miller, among them Councilwoman Dona Brady, said that the devastated mother died of a broken heart. 

Neither Browne not representatives from The Montel Williams Show have publicly commented on Amanda Berry's case.

On Tuesday, the 76-year-old psychic faced sharp criticism for falsely predicting the death of the missing teen.

In hot water: Browne, 76, has been lambasted for wrongly predicting Amanda's death, with online commenters calling her names and accusing her of being a fraud

Furious Twitter and Facebook users heaped insults on Browne, calling her a 'grief vampire' and a' hunch-backed harpy,' among other things. 

'I remember you on Montel Williams telling the family of Amanda Berry she was dead," wrote Facebook commenter Lisa Lupas on Browne's Facebook page. 'What do you have to say for yourself? You are a fraud! What a horrible horrible thing to say to a family holding on to nothing but hope and faith. Shame on you!'

Another commenter Michael Martin wrote: 'Hey Sylvia, Amanda Berry is alive. Think of the torment you put her mother through when you told the poor woman her daughter was dead.

'Then the mother herself died before she could learn the truth. You are evil, evil, evil and ought to be ashamed of yourself.'

KIRO Radio host Dori Monson chided both the medium and Williams for taking hope away from Miller in her hour of grief and doubt, according to MyNorthWest.com.

Past failure: Browne was under fire in 2007 for incorrectly telling the parents of missing 11-year-old Shawn Hornebeck (left) that he was dead. The teen was found alive four years later (right)

'The fact that he [Williams] got so far deep into the sewer that he brings this grieving mom on to have some phony psychic tell her that her daughter's dead...it's despicable,' said Monson.

This is not the first time that Browne, who also has helped the FBI in the past, faced public scrutiny over her predictions.

In 2003, the TV psychic incorrectly told the parents of missing 11-year-old boy Shawn Hornebeck that their son was dead, and that his body could be found near 'two jagged boulders,' ABC News reported.

Nearly four years later, Shawn was found living with his kidnapper Michael Devlin 60 miles from his home in Missouri.

A website was created in 2006 called Stop Sylvia Browne dedicated to documenting the psychic's purported failures.
