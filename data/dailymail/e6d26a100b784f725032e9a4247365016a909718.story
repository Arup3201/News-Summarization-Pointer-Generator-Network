In the Arizona desert the first of Qantas's aged fleet of Boeing 767s jets are landing ...for the last time.

It's called the 'great aeroplane graveyard' and like thousands of decommissioned military and passenger craft before them, it's where Qantas's reliable but costly 767 'workhorses' will retire. In the dust of a former airforce base in Victorville, California. 

'Picture hot winds and shifting desert sands, prairy dogs and rattlesnakes  - and all you can hear is the hum of thousands of rusting propellers turning in the wind,'  says 60 Minutes Presenter Charles Wooley, who recently took a ticket on an empty 767  to it's final resting place at the Southern California Logistics Airport.  'Let's just say I wouldn't recommend it as a tourist destination - it's a very eery place.'

Aeroplane graveyard: Qantas's aged fleet of Boeing 767s retiring to a former airforce base in Victorville, California, USA.

Qantas announced plans for all nine of its remaining 767 fleet to be retired by the end of 2014, nine months earlier than originally planned. The jets have already outlived their predicted 2010 used-by date and are now too costly to keep in the air. In their place, Qantas have chosen the more fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliners.

Television Presenter Charles Wooley enjoyed the cabin to himself on one of the last 787 flights, named 'Charlie 1' by the crew.

'It was a bit like the Twilight Zone, I was half-expecting to see a monkey appear on the wing,' he said. 'Actually it was an all-female crew, it was symbolic since the making of the Boeing 767 in the 1980s coincided with the time women really began flying passenger planes.' 

'When we landed, I met all my old friends out there. I must have been on those jets more than a hundred times over the years with 60 minutes,' says Wooley. 'These were masterpieces of 20th century engineering.'

What will happen to them now? Engineers will 'rip the guts out of some', others will be wrapped up to keep their engines intact.

'One guy out there says to me: "Well Charlie, some might be picked up by a billionaire, but I'd say most will end up as beer cans,'" says Wooley.

The Flying Kangaroos in Arizona now look much like any other old jet, with the bounding marsupials on their tails painted out in red. Wooley says it was hard to film at the graveyard because 'Boeing shareholders don't like seeing all these mothballs sitting around.'

'Airlines, like TV companies these days, are never too far away from bankruptcy - but it's all about fuel, cheaper planes that are much more economical to continue to fly,' he says.

And it's not all bad news for the airline industry. According to Wooley, Boeing are producing 42 new Dreamliner craft at their plant in Seattle every month.

In Australia, the final Qantas Boeing 767 flight will run from Melbourne to Sydney on December 27  -  but residents of other Australian cities still have one last chance to grab a ride on the big bird between November and December this year.
