Dozens of protesters on both sides of the immigration debate showed up in a small town near Tucson on Tuesday after the sheriff said the federal government plans to transport about 40 immigrant children to an academy for troubled youths - but the kids never arrived.

The rallies demonstrated the deep divide of the immigration debate. One group waved American flags, held signs that read 'Return to Sender' and 'Go home non-Yankees' and said they would block a bus that was supposed to arrive with immigrant children aboard.

It turned heated at times, with 
shouting matches and a group of mariachi musicians getting shoved before
 the skirmishes were quelled.

A few miles up the road, about 50 pro-immigrant supporters held welcome signs with drawings of hearts.  The dueling groups each had about 50 people.

A major U.S. effort to discourage repeated attempts by immigrants to enter the country illegally by flying and busing them into Mexico hundreds of miles away from where they were caught has been sharply scaled back after producing relatively modest gains

'We are not going to tolerate illegals forced upon us,' protester Loren Woods said.

Emily Duwel of Oracle said she did not want her town to be misrepresented by what she said was a minority of people against the children being housed here.

'I'm just concerned about these children who have had to escape worlds of incredible violence,' Duwel said.

No immigrant children had arrived as of midday, and it wasn't clear if they would ever show up. 

Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu's office cited 'whistleblowers' within the Department of Homeland Security that immigrant children were being sent there.

A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat who represents southern Arizona, said the congressman's office was told by the federal government that children would not be arriving Tuesday.

Anger has been spreading in the town of Oracle since Sheriff Babeu warned residents last week that immigrant children from Central America caught crossing the border illegally would be placed at the Sycamore Canyon Academy in Oracle.

Protesters were hoping to mirror demonstrations in Murrieta, California, when immigrants were taken there recently.

Babeu is credited with stirring up the anti-immigrant protesters via social media postings and a press release Monday and by leaking information about the migrants coming to a local activist.

He addressed both sides of the protesters, asking them to remain civil, abide by the law and keep the roads cleared.

Immigrant rights activists questioned Babeu about why he is stirring up protesters when he should be bringing order as the county's top lawman.

The sheriff says he is concerned about public safety because he does not know whether any of the migrant children are gang affiliated or have health issues. He said that reports of health issues are likely overblown.

Open hearts: Approximately 50 people gathered in Oracle, Ariz., 50 miles from Tucson, to pass friendly messages to unaccompanied minors of Central American origins

Babeu has generated controversy in the past over his immigration rhetoric. When five bodies were found in a burned-out SUV in his county in 2012, Babeu quickly declared that the killings appeared to be the work of a drug cartel.

A few days later, it was learned that it was a murder-suicide of a suburban Phoenix family and not drug-related.

The same year, Sheriff Babeu, then a rising star in the local Republican Party with aspirations to run for a congressional seat, became embroiled in a scandal sparked by allegations that he threatened his ex-boyfriend, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, with deportation, Phoenix New Times reported.

Jose Orozco, Babeu’s former paramour, accused him of threatening to use his influence to eject him from the country if their relationship ever became public.

Babeu, who at the time co-chaired Mitt Rooney's presidential campaign in Arizona, vehemently denied these allegations, even as Orozco released their text message exchanges on the subject and a photo depicting the sheriff in his underwear, which he allegedly had emailed to an unnamed friend.

About five months later, a special prosecutor assigned to investigate the claims cleared Babeu of any wrongdoing, saying that there was no indication the sheriff misused his authority or public funds to intimidate his ex-boyfriend.

The controversy forced Babeu to part ways with Romney’s campaign and drop out of the congressional race. 

'All this was done in secrecy and that's where a lot of people are upset,' Babeu said Tuesday. 'My concern (is) where's the federal government? Why are they not here? Why did they not hold a town hall to answer some of these questions?'

Calls to the academy where the children were supposed to be housed were not returned.

A spokesman for the federal Department of Health and Human Services said the agency would not identify the locations of shelters for migrants to protect their identities and security.

'We don't know who they are. We don't know their health conditions. We don't know a doggone thing because the federal government isn't telling us anything,' protest organizer Robert Skiba said.

Anger has been spreading since a massive surge in unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally began more than a month ago.

Though largely considered a humanitarian crisis, the influx of immigrants has also become political fodder.

In a state known for its strict immigration laws, including SB1070, which many call the 'show me your papers' law, attitudes are just as contentious.

The fallout began in late May when reports surfaced that immigration officials were dropping off hundreds of women and children at Phoenix and Tucson Greyhound bus stations after they had been caught crossing the border illegally.

Within a week, immigration authorities were flying hundreds of children who had crossed the border into Texas alone to the Border Patrol facility in Nogales.

Possible solution: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he is prepared to host some of the undocumented youths in temporary shelters set up in his city

Republican Gov. Jan Brewer sharply criticized the move and demanded it stop. Republican candidates for governor have also chimed in. Some are expected to attend the rally on Tuesday.

As tempers flared during the dual protests in Oracle, Arizona, Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he is prepared to host some of the undocumented youths in his city.

Garcetti announced that he is working with local charities to find temporary shelter for some of the Central American children in response to a request made by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.

The subject of kids fleeing from countries in Central America to the U.S. arose at a forum hosted by Politico Magazine, where Garcetti was asked whether Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, would be willing to accept any of the youngsters on a temporary basis.

‘We are going to. We've already talked to HHS,’ he said, adding, ‘These are children.

‘As a father, who are we as Americans if we don't step forward first and say, “these kids who are isolated, alone ... let's get them someplace safe and secure,"’ he said.

Mayoral spokeswoman Vicki Curry said Garcetti, acting at the request of HHS, had convened a meeting last Friday with a number of local charities and public agencies ‘to discuss the means of taking in and taking care of some these children.’

Garcetti said 62 per cent of Los Angeles residents are immigrants or children of immigrants, a demographic he cited as a ‘competitive strength’ for the city.
