Henrik Stenson was flying back from Atlanta to his home in Orlando last year when he couldn’t help but reflect that his life had turned a sweet full circle.

Safely tucked away was the $11.4million (£7m) he had just claimed for winning the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup. Some 35,000ft below was the prison believed to be housing the notorious fraudster Allen Stanford, the man who swindled Stenson out of a similar sum in 2009.

‘Life has a funny way of setting things right,’ said the personable Swede. ‘I was more than $11 million richer and here we were, flying over the federal prison in Florida where he is very possibly serving his sentence. There was some satisfaction in that, although I couldn’t help but think of the people who lost a tremendous amount of money who weren’t fortunate enough to earn it back.’

Fortune: After victories in the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup, Henrik Stenson earned £7m

It has taken Stenson a long time to speak openly about that bleak period but he has come to terms with it now. ‘It’s safe to say I won’t be visiting him in prison,’ he said. ‘What I might do to him if I saw him face to face might get me arrested as well. I lost millions in a Ponzi scheme and, while I didn’t have all my eggs in his basket, it hurt.’

Was it a coincidence that Stenson fell off the charts in the years that followed? Some of those close to him, like his English coach Pete Cowen, understandably believe there to be a link but Stenson himself won’t use it as an excuse.

‘It affected me but I got over it emotionally faster than people think,’ he told US magazine Golf Digest. ‘I knew investing carries risk and as a professional golfer I’m used to taking risks. A pro golf career is basically a gamble, at least starting out.

‘Of course I assumed there was only normal risk, when in truth I was destined to lose the whole investment. But it all fell under the category of risk, so I tried to accept it and move on.’

Loss: in 2009, Stenson lost a vast sum of money to fraudster Allen Stanford, who is now in jail

He has now done so to such an extent that he enjoyed something of a Rory McIlroy-style summer last year, flattening everyone to top the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic and help himself to the tidy sum of on-course earnings of $21m.

He was also the first player to tie up his place in Europe’s Ryder Cup team — fully eight months before the end of automatic qualifying. In three weeks, he will play in his third Ryder Cup but first for six years.

‘It has been strange knowing for so long I had made it, but now the team has been finalised it is time to put the Ryder Cup game face on,’ he said.

‘I suppose it was inevitable there would be a reaction this year after what happened last summer, but I haven’t played badly. I’m still in the world’s top three and feel like my best golf is not far away, so I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve missed it.’

Sympathy: Stenson said he is happy with his success, but feels for those unable to replace their lost wealth

Stenson might be the only player in world golf who has managed to fight back from not one horrendous slump but two. The first came in 2001, when his driving was so bad he would regularly miss fairways by 70 yards. Both times he fell outside the world’s top 200 and both times he bounced back into the top five.

The fearless 38-year-old will undoubtedly be one of captain Paul McGinley’s key men, both on the course with his ferocious hitting and keeping everyone relaxed off it with his dry sense of humour and penchant for practical jokes. You could easily see him playing the role of patriarch to a rookie like Victor Dubuisson or equally, forming a formidable all-Scandinavian partnership with Thomas Bjorn.

First things first, though, and Stenson is in need of a top-four finish here at the BMW Championship to make the top 30 who will contest his two titles, the Tour Championship and the FedEx finale, in Atlanta next week.

He made a good start, completing a first round 68 yesterday, as one of nine players who were unable to finish on Thursday. Playing partner Graeme McDowell could only manage a 73.

Joint leaders after first round 67s were Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth and Gary Woodland. As for the other European Ryder Cuppers, Sergio Garcia and Martin Kaymer shot 68s while Justin Rose shot 69.
