Diners at a restaurant in China will no longer have to deal with human errors from their waiters. 

Inspired by the Bots cafe from the US hit shot Sam and Cat, a restaurant owner in China has created an eaterie filled with robots. 

The cafe in Ningbo, a seaport city in northeastern China's Zhejiang province now has automated waiters who take orders and serve food to any table within the restaurant - and tell customers to enjoy their meal in Mandarin.

Although wages for the robots are non-existent, they still do not come cheap, costing at least £6,000 each.

But with a five-year-warranty on each one, and the fact that they only need to be charged four-hours-a-day, the owner Lu Dike, 48, says that in the long-term it will save him a fortune in wages.

The machines are a popular draw at the restaurants, with diners wanting to experience being serviced by them.

They also have the capability to speak up to 40 phrases in Mandarin Chinese, such as 'enjoy your meal'.

Diners at the restaurant love the robots so much that they are pressuring the owner to start selling them 

Owner Mr Lu is being pressured to put the robots on sale for people to take home.

He said: 'I get asked at least once a day if I'm prepared to sell one of them. 

'Who knows? Maybe it might be a good sideline.'

Customer Xu Yuan, 34, who is interested in purchasing a robot waiter said: 'I really like the service and I think I would really like one at home.

'My son has been pestering me ever since we came here for a snack after a trip to the movies.'
