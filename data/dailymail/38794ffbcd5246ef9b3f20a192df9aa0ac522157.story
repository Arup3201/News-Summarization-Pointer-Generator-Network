A respected South Australian doctor has been charged with murdering his wife after she was discovered dead on a 1,200 metre mountain in Tasmania on Thursday.

Robin Michael, 63, had been on holidays with his wife Kerry Michael, 44,  in Tasmania where they had been travelling for several weeks, when her body was discovered near the summit of Mount Roland, in the state's northwest. 

The pair are believed to have gone for a walk on the mountain, near the town of Sheffield, before her body was discovered 200 metres from the top of the mountain at approximately 2pm, reported Adelaide Now.

An air search was launched by authorities, who said Ms Michael had suffered trauma injuries.

Ms Michael had been reported missing by concerned family in Adelaide, who contacted police after Mr Michael posted several bizarre comments on Facebook. 

'There's some contact between family members that created concern for her welfare that led us to this area,' said Inspector Kim Steven.

'I believe there were some social media interaction that raised those concerns,' he told The ABC. 

Tasmanian police confirmed on Friday that Mr Michael, a health administrator with nearly 30 years experience, had been charged with the death of his wife.

He was arrested at the East Devonport caravan park and was taken into custody after being treated in hospital.

'We know they went for a day walk on Wednesday morning and that the woman was killed that day,' Inspector Stevens told Adelaide Now.

'While a man is in custody, we still need to build an exact picture of what took place and are appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area to come forward.' 

He was silent at a hearing in Davenport on Friday, appearing before a magistrate in blue overalls with no shoes on his feet and a cut on his face, which is believed to be self-inflicted.

Mr Michaels did not enter a plea, and will reappear on Tuesday.

He has been refused bail.

The 63-year-old had returned to Adelaide in 2007 as the chief executive at Radiology Resources Pty Ltd after serving as the general manager Royal Darwin Hospital.

He has also worked with the South Australian Department of Human Services, where he acted as the executive director. 

Forensic evidence has been gathered by police who were transported to the mountain by helicopter.

The couple's camper van, which they had been travelling in for several weeks, was examined by authorities.
