Parents in an Indianapolis neighborhood are on high alert after a nine-year-old girl out selling Girl Scout cookies was shot during a drive-by on Tuesday.

And the suspects are still at large. 

Police say that Sinai Miller was out with her two sisters close to the Retreat Cooperative apartments, near Westlane and Michigan Roads, around 4:30 p.m when a blue Ford Expedition drove by.

Two or three bullets were fired from the car - one hit the front door of an apartment, where no one was home, and another hit Sinai in the leg, Fox 59 reported.

Shot: Sinai Miller, 9 (center), had only just left her house in Indianapolis' north side when she was shot

Scene: Sinai was near the Retreat Cooperative apartments when a SUV came past and starting shooting

Luckily, the injuries were not life-threatening.

Sinai was rushed to hospital but was released after one day.

She is now recovering at home.

Mark Chandler, the boyfriend of Sinai's mother, said the little girl had just left the house to sell cookies when she was shot.

'They walked outside the door and they didn’t even get to make it across the lot and then the shots start ringing out,' Chandler told Fox 59.

Chandler said he found Sinai on the ground bleeding.

Investigation: Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward as they try to find the people responsible

She is struggling to understand what happened to her, Chandler said. 

'It’s just ridiculous - she’s 9-years-old,' he said.

'She's very smart. 

'She don’t know nothing about no gun or no shots or whatever.'

Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward to help them find the people responsible.

No description of the suspects or a possible motive have been released.
