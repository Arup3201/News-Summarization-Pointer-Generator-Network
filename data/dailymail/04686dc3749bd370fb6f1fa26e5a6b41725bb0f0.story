Nazi hunter: Hanns Alexander, a Jewish refugee serving in the British Army, captured Rudolph Hoss

A German-born Jewish refugee who 
served in the British Army during World War II has been unveiled as one 
of the leading investigators responsible for the capture of one of the 
worst Nazi criminals of the Holocaust.

Throughout his life in Britain, Hanns Alexander never spoke of his involvement in the hunt for Auschwitz commander Rudolph Höss, and the truth was not unveiled until after his death.

In 1946 he played a crucial role in 
bringing Höss to justice, a man responsible 
for killing millions of Jewish men, women and children.

Rudolph Höss was not only in charge 
of the deadliest of the Holocaust concentration camps, he was also the 
mastermind behind the use of Zyklon B to commit mass killings of, mainly Jewish, prisoners.

Mr Alexander’s story was uncovered by 
his great-nephew at the war hero’s funeral in 2006.

During a eulogy, Mr 
Alexander’s nephews spoke of his past as a Nazi hunter and Thomas 
Harding, whose grandmother was Mr Alexander’s sister, began to 
investigate his past.

Hanns Alexander fled from Berlin to 
London in 1936 after his father, already in England, heard rumours of 
what was about to take place in their native Germany.

When Britain declared war on Germany 
in 1939, 22-year-old Hanns and his twin brother Paul volunteer for the 
British Army and were placed with the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps, a
 unit of refugees who wanted to fight the Nazis.

In 1945, having taken part in the 
D-Day landings in Normandy and witnessing the liberation of Bergen 
Belsen concentration camp, Hanns Alexander was chosen to take part in a 
12-strong team, tasked with tracking down Nazi war criminals.

As the team rounded up the Bergen Belsen
 guards and administrators, interpreter Hanns became central in the 
interrogations and uncovers Rudolph Höss’s role in the Holocaust.

Hanns Alexander then began his hunt for 
Höss, knowing that the former Auschwitz Kommendant would hold the key 
information to the workings of the Nazi atrocities committed against his
 people.

After the fall of Auschwitz, Höss and 
his family had fled towards the Danish border. British intelligence 
had tracked them down to the Flensburg area, where Höss’s wife Hedwig and
 their children lived in an old sugar factory.

Having managed to intercept a letter from 
Hedwig proving that she knew where her husband was hiding, she had been 
taken in for questioning.

Hanns arrived on March 7, 1946 and begin to interrogate Mrs Höss. She would not budge. But neither would Hanns Alexander.

Hanns and members of his team brought in Höss’s oldest son Klaus and threatened Hedwig with deporting him to Siberia.

Ten minutes later, Hedwig had written 
down the location and new alias of her husband, who was living at a farm
 under the name Franz Lang.

Rudolf Höss was arrested on March 11, 
1946. Hanns Alexander and his men dragged him out of hiding and beat him
 until he gave up his true identity.

Höss stood trial at Nuremberg in April 
and was subsequently handed over to Polish authorities on 25 May 1946, 
where he stood trial accused of murdering three million people.

Höss was sentenced to death on 2 April
 1947 and was hanged immediately adjacent to the crematorium of the 
former Auschwitz I concentration camp on April 16.

Captain Hanns Alexander never returned to Germany, and died in London in 2006, aged 89.
