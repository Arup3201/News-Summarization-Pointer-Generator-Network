The grieving parents of a policeman killed by a yob whilst out celebrating his birthday told today how the tragedy had robbed them of their lives as well.

PC Gareth Francis, 28, hit his head on the cobbles of a pavement after he got inadvertently caught up in a petty feud and was struck with a single punch in the street.

The off-duty officer was knocked unconscious by the force of the impact and died later in hospital from fatal head injuries.

His killer Westley Holland, 21, who played an Xbox computer game after the fatal attack in Stockport, told a friend: 'I have just hit the lad, I think I have killed him.'

When police caught up with him he falsely blamed Greater Manchester PC Francis for the tragedy and said: 'So that guy has died has he, what do you expect when they front you up? I’m not gonna stand there am I?'

Today as Holland began four-and-a-half-years in jail after being convicted of manslaughter, PC Francis' parents Roy and Rita, both 55, said even 1,000 years in jail would not be enough.

In a statement they said: 'In one single punch, a solitary criminal act and a moment of madness, Westley Holland not only took Gareth’s life but he took ours too.

'Life as we knew it also died that terrible night because our lives have never been the same since.

'In fact we consider our lives in two separate entities; life before Gareth died and life after. There are few similarities between the two. Life before Gareth died was perfect.

'The life we have now is the polar opposite of this perfection. It is so extreme it hardly bears resemblance to our ‘before Gareth died’ life. It feels like it has all gone.

'Everything we did revolved around our family. The drive we had in life was all to do with providing for our children and now that drive has gone because our family has lost its key component, our only son.

'We accept no sentence passed can ever bring Gareth back but we needed to see some justice done.

'We understand the sentence can’t be 1,000 years in prison and even if it was it would not provide even an ounce of comfort because our grief is too intense for any relief. We are simply inconsolable.

'We want Westley Holland to realise the very great human cost and catastrophic lifelong consequences for those left to grieve, of a split second decision to throw one single punch which took the life of our beautiful son.'

The tragedy occurred on January 20 after PC Francis who worked for Greater Manchester Police based at West Didsbury and described as a 'consummate professional police officer' had gone out to celebrate his birthday with friends.

The group were about to go home at the end of the evening after being dropped off by taxi when one of the officer’s friends James Bell bumped into Holland by chance.

Bell and Holland were said to have a 'long history of ill feeling' and began eyeballing each other before violence broke out.

Holland lashed out and 'used his fist in anger' upon PC Francis who was looking on as 'his way of having the last word,' said prosecutors at Manchester Crown Court.

In their statement PC Francis’ father, a director of an electrical company added: 'We were present as our son’s last moments were played out in public in court on CCTV, we have listened as our son’s killer told lies after lies.

'I have had to watch my wife and daughter’s pain as we struggle as a family to comprehend how someone can kill such an amazing man and then go and play on a Playstation game - entirely indifferent to the fact that our beautiful Gareth lay dying in the street where he left him.

'It is the height of disrespect. Our loss is so great that we can never forgive him.'

Holland was arrested at a friend’s home at 4.25am, just over three hours after PC Francis’ collapse.

He said he had been playing the Xbox game to 'take his mind off the fight'.

During the trial he denied unlawful killing claiming he feared PC Francis was about to attack him when he threw the fateful punch.

He told the jury: 'He was coming at me. It could have been me on the floor. I thought he was going to hit me, it could have been me. I acted in self-defence. He come at me and I threw a punch.'

But passing sentence Judge Michael Henshell told him: 'Gareth was a much loved son and his parents were at the stage of their life where they expect they would watch him develop as an adult and live a successful and fruitful life.

'The whole family has been devastated by his death and you caused it. You meant to strike him and the consequences were tragic. You wanted to take advantage of the surprise attack and you did. He was hit unawares.

'You have a capacity for confrontation and aggressive behaviour which was demonstrated in this case. You did not intend the harm but the harm was of the highest level. There was no remorse evident during the trial.'

After the case Charlotte Rimmer, District Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West said: 'Westley Holland’s violent actions caused the needless death of Gareth Francis, whose chosen career was to dutifully serve the public as a police officer.

'This case demonstrates just how much damage one punch can cause, and although no outcome can compensate Gareth’s family and friends for their devastating loss.'

Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The consequences of what Holland did have been devastating for both Gareth’s family, his partner, friends and for his colleagues in the police force.

'His single punch has led to a tragic waste of a young life and he will now spend the rest of his life living with the consequences.

'This case once again demonstrates the dreadful outcomes possible when people try to settle disputes with their fists.'
