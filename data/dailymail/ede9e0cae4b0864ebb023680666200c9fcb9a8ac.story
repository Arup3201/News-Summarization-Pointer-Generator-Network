Manny Pacquiao suffers from such bad leg cramps during training that he spends a staggering $1,800 on a tube of anti-inflammatory cream.

The Filipino superstar is into the fourth week of his training camp ahead of his $300million mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather Jnr on May 2.

And his trainer Freddie Roach revealed the problems he has due to the size of his calves.

'There's no magic cure for it,' Roach told Yahoo. 'We're doing what we can do. I've got the doctors working on it. There are some Filipino guys here who are massaging it for him. The cream cost $1,800 for a single bottle. I wasn't too happy about that.'

The cost is so high because Pacquiao does not have health insurance in the United States and the cream had to be run past USADA who are conducting drug tests in the build-up to the Las Vegas showdown.

Roach has also changed Pacquiao's training regime to reduce the pressure on his legs.

'We did change his running schedule because I don't like him running the hills six days a week,' he added. 'I've got him on the track a lot more now doing fast sprint-type workouts instead of hill workouts. I think it's better for the older fighters sometimes to stay away from the hills so much.'
