Foolish: Banned driver James Phillips, 22, panicked when he was spotted riding his moped and decided to try and evade capture

With a top speed of around 30mph, a second-hand 50cc moped would not be the getaway vehicle of choice for most criminals.

But police pursuing James Phillips in a
decidedly low-speed chase were determined not be beaten – and sent up 
the force helicopter.

That wasn’t all. Four patrol cars were also drafted in as the moped pootled along at 15mph.

And after a not-so nail biting chase through the streets of Bristol, the officers finally got their man.

During the daylight pursuit, Phillips,
22, a disqualified driver, was seen slowing down for speed bumps, but 
also mounted pavements and swerved dangerously in front of cars.

Crew in
the helicopter gave a running commentary on his progress and at one 
point emphasised the low speed he was riding at, telling colleagues on 
the ground: ‘Speed is 15 - one - five - miles an hour.’

Phillips managed to evade two police cars on his £200 Piaggio for just over a mile before giving up and pulling over.

At one stage, a man tried to punch him
off the bike but narrowly missed him.

Phillips was arrested for 
dangerous driving, and driving while disqualified and without insurance.

He admitted the offences as his barrister said he had been stupid.

Bristol Crown Court heard Phillips, a roofer, ‘panicked’ when he saw police and attempted to flee.

Footage from the 180mph helicopter, 
which is jointly owned by two forces – Avon and Somerset and 
Gloucestershire – was played to the court.

Defending, Farah Rashid said: ‘He 
panicked and behaved in a really stupid way. He was going to get caught.

'There was no excessive speed. It was only a matter of time that police 
would arrest him and he stopped voluntarily after some distance. It was,
perhaps, more stupid than dangerous under the circumstances.’

The court heard Phillips, of Southmead
in Bristol, had a previous conviction for dangerous driving when he 
drove a car from a burglary, from which others hurled bottles at police.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Silly: Disqualified driver James Phillips attempted to outrun police while travelling at 15mph on his moped

Futile: He continued on his journey for more than a mile, slowing for speed bumps - but mounted pavements and swerved dangerously in front of cars

Daft: Phillips had no chance of escaping from a police helicopter and four patrol cars

He was given a nine-month jail term 
suspended for 18 months and told to do 100 hours of unpaid work and 
undergo a thinking skills programme. He was also disqualified from 
driving for three years, ordered to take an extended driving test and 
pay a victim surcharge of £100.

Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC told him: ‘You are 22 and you’ve clearly made a nuisance of yourself quite a lot in the past.

‘You drove dangerously, without insurance, when disqualified.

‘You don’t need me to tell you it deserves a prison sentence. I have decided to suspend that sentence.

‘It looks to me as though you are 
growing up. That’s what it’s all about, isn’t it?’

He went on: ‘You are 
22, you have responsibilities, a partner, a child, you have done courses
and you work.’

After the case one officer said: ‘You 
normally expect a bit of drama when the helicopter’s up and you hear 
there’s a chase on.

'But this was more like a guided tour. On that moped 
he was going nowhere fast.’

Phillips said yesterday: ‘It was a 
stupid mistake, that’s all. I don’t know what I was thinking really. I 
would not do it again – I didn’t even think I would get away from them.’

Asked why the helicopter was sent up, a
spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said: ‘Whenever a vehicle fails 
to stop for police, the helicopter is requested to manage the pursuit to
reduce the risk to members of the public.

‘The aircraft’s observer will give a 
full commentary so experienced officers from the Road Policing Unit can 
intercept the vehicle and bring the pursuit to a safe conclusion.’

He 
added: ‘Often the footage taken from the helicopter forms part of the 
evidence used to bring offenders to justice.’

Chase: The undramatic trip ended when he pulled onto a pavement as two more patrol cars dashed to the scene

Captured: Phillips admitted he made a 'stupid mistake'

Arrest: Police officers surround Phillips following the very low speed chase

He was given a nine-month jail term suspended for 18 months and told to do 100 hours of unpaid work and undergo a thinking skills programme.

He was also disqualified from driving for three years, ordered to take an extended driving test and pay a victim surcharge of £100.

Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC told him: 'You are 22 and you've clearly made a nuisance of yourself quite a lot in the past.

'You drove dangerously, without insurance, when disqualified.

'You don't need me to tell you it deserves a prison sentence. I have decided to suspend that sentence.

'It looks to me as though you are growing up. That's what it's all about, isn't it?
