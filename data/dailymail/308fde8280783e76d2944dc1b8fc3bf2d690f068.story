She has graced the glossy cover of Vogue, starred as the face of every big fashion label from Chanel to Versace and was declared by Vogue Paris to be one of the top 30 models of the 2000s.

So it comes as no surprise that Canadian model Coco Rocha looked fit for the catwalk at one of New York's most glamorous events: The Silver Hill 2012 Gala.

The 24-year-old smouldered on the red carpet in a burnt orange floor length evening dress and proved exactly why Tyra Banks dubbed her 'the Queen of posing'.

Wearing her hair in a pretty, loose up-do, Coco teamed the outfit with dazzling silver accessories as she posed for photographers.

The model was joined on the red carpet by couture fur fashion designer Dennis Basso and his husband Michael Cominotto.

The 2012 Silver Hill Hospital Gala, which took place at Cipriani 42nd Street, New York last night, is a black-tie gala that raises funds for patient scholarships for those needing financial assistance for residential treatment.

As a result of the 2012 and 2011 Galas, Silver Hill delivered $1.5 million in scholarship care.

With Michael Cominotto and Dennis Basso back as honorary co-chairs, the talented Martha Stewart as Mistress of Ceremonies, and honoree Neil Sedaka delivering a special performance, the 2012 Gala was a glittering charitable occasion.

Coco Rocha is known for her charitable giving and last year she designed a capsule collection for Senhoa, an organisation helping Cambodian survivors of human trafficking.

Each piece was designed by Rocha and hand crafted by the survivors of human trafficking with every lat penny going back to the charity.
