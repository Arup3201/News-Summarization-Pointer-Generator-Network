She's famous for her love of the high street and cheering on boyfriend Andy Murray at the US Open proved to be the perfect place to debut yet another cheap and chic buy for Kim Sears.

Elegant in a £29.99 cobalt blue top from high street favourite Zara, the 25-year-old joined the tennis star's mother, Judy, to cheer Murray on in his fourth round match against Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin.

And while Judy was low-key in a simple denim jacket, glamorous Kim added sparkle courtesy of an eye-catching floral necklace from the Spanish brand.

Even her bag was a high street hit with the £329 Ted Baker Baillie bag worn to day one of the US Open making a second appearance.

Despite occasional nail-biting moments, both Kim and Judy seemed happy and relaxed as they cheered Murray onto victory.

Kim's elegant sense of style has become as much of a favourite among tennis fans as her boyfriend's winning performances.

And while she always looks a million dollars, thrifty Kim's wardrobe owes more to her penchant for scouring the high street than splashing out on designer names.

Favourites include Zara, Whistles and Hobbs, although she did plump for £925 mint green Victoria Beckham for June's historic Wimbledon final.

Cool jewels: Kim's eye-catching necklace is also a savvy purchase from the Spanish brand

Despite her occasional foray into the world of designer wares, Kim's passion for the high street shows no sign of cooling.

For the Wimbledon semi-final, savvy shopper Kim plumped for a striking orange dress from Hobbs, while earlier this year, she chose a simple Whistles frock for a trip to Royal Ascot.

Her demure look and simple approach to styling, as well as her incredibly glossy mane, have won Kim comparisons with fellow Zara fan, the Duchess of Cambridge.

The new mother even plumped for the brand on her first appearance since the birth of Prince George, when she appeared at an event in Anglesey with husband Prince William.

The Duchess' simple floral Zara top marked a return to her pre-baby fashionable best, and looked perfect teamed with a neat Ralph Lauren blazer and skinny Paige Denim jeans.
