No warning signs: Choreographer Stacy Walker said Michael Jackson showed no clues that he was ill during tour rehearsals

An associate choreographer who worked on Michael Jackson's planned comeback concerts testified on Monday that she didn't see any signs that the pop superstar was ill or might die in the final days of his life.

'I just never in a million years thought he would leave us, or pass away,' Stacy Walker told jurors hearing a lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother against concert promoter AEG Live LLC.

'It just never crossed my mind.'

Walker, who is testifying for AEG, said Jackson appeared thinner than he had been in previous years and wore multiple layers of clothes while rehearsing for his This Is It shows planned for London's O2 arena.Â 

She said despite Jackson missing 
multiple rehearsals, she was convinced based on his performances the 
last two days of his life that he was ready for the series of shows.

Her testimony was supported by Travis Payne, an associate director on the This Is It concerts

Payne, who rehearsed one-on-one with Jackson and helped craft the 
creative vision for the show, said he never saw signs that Jackson was 
ill or impaired in early preparations.

'I thought he was thinner than he was in the past, but I didn't have any reason to be alarmed,' Payne said.

He
briefly discussed Jackson missing rehearsals, but has not yet addressed
Jackson's appearance in his final days. Payne resumes testifying on 
Tuesday.

Walker said she attributed Jackson's 
multi-layered wardrobe to a personal preference. She said she recalled 
one incident in which Jackson may have appeared groggy or drugged, but 
she said she couldn't remember whether she witnessed or heard about it 
from others on the show.

Walker was the first witness called by AEG in a trial filed by Jackson's mother, Katherine, against the concert promoter.

Her suit claims AEG didn't properly investigate the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death and that its executives missed signs that the singer was unprepared for the comeback shows.

AEG denies all wrongdoing, and contends Jackson hid his struggles with prescription drug addiction.

Jackson died in June 2009 from an overdose of the anesthetic propofol, which he had been using as a sleep aid.

Previous witnesses have testified that Jackson was shivering, had to be fed by others and appeared unprepared during rehearsals for the This Is It shows.

Walker said she never saw any of that behavior, although she acknowledged that her job was to work with other dancers and not Jackson directly.

'I wasn't looking for things at the time,' she said. 'I wish I was.'

Payne, however, worked with Jackson individually almost every day for the last three months of the singer's life.

He ate lunches with Jackson, saying the star's appetite varied daily. The Thriller singer was able to perform many of his familiar dance moves, although they had to be modified because the singer was 50 years old and not as limber as he had been decades earlier.

He said Jackson was tired for some of the sessions and that 'some days would be better than others'.

A medical examiner who conducted Jackson's autopsy testified on Tuesday that Jackson was not underweight when he died and appeared to be in excellent health.

Despite testimony from some witnesses that Jackson appeared emaciated, Dr. Christopher Rogers said the singer did not bear the signs of someone who was starving when he died.

Walker and Payne, who have worked with Jackson since the 1990s, were called Monday because they are slated to leave the country for work. The trial is expected to last several more weeks.
