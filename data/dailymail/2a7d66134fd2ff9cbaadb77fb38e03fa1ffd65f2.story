Alan Hansen has covered his final game as a pundit for the BBC and, to say farewell and thank you, Gary Lineker has presented him with a commemorative trophy.

The 59-year-old Scotsman stood down from his role after the World Cup Final between Germany and Argentina on Sunday.

And Lineker took to Twitter to post a picture of the two of them posing together with the silverware, which was engraved with the words: 'Alan Hansen "Simply the best". From all your friends at BBC Sport.'

Hansen is retiring from the BBC after 22 years on Match of the Day, becoming one of the iconic faces of the BBC's flagship football show.

He was also a regular at major tournaments, covering every World Cup and European Championships during his time as a pundit.

But he is perhaps best known for his infamous 'you can't win anything with kids' remark about Manchester United's young guns at the start of the 1995/95 season - when Sir Alex Ferguson's side went on to become one of the most successful in English football history.
