Basketball star Dwight Howard is under criminal investigation for child abuse in Georgia following allegations that he beat his six-year-old son with a belt buckle, according to reports. 

Law enforcement sources have revealed that the Houston Rockets center admits he hit son Braylon with a belt, but insisted that he did not know it was wrong because he was hit as a child, TMZ reported. 

The website previously stated that the Department of Children and Families (DCF) in Florida determined there was not enough evidence of child abuse to go forward with the case.

But since the incident occurred in Georgia, police from the state asked Florida for the file.

A Georgia law enforcement source reportedly told TMZ that 'people who were not so forthcoming before today [Monday] have been'. 

The source added that detectives conducted a number of one-on-one interviews and said that the case 'has now been raised to top of the list'.

The case concerns allegations put forward by Braylon's mother, Royce Reed, who reportedly filed a complaint saying Howard had whipped their son with a belt, leaving the boy with bruises and abrasions. 

On Monday, TMZ Sports quoted from documents obtained from the DCF summarizing the findings of the doctor who examined the boy.

The case comes two weeks after NFL star Adrian Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault for disciplining his son

The doctor  reportedly discovered injuries 'consistent with Braylon being struck with the buckle end of the belt' and 'consistent with a medical diagnosis of physical abuse'.

The documents allegedly state: 'Dr Kesler noted Braylon to have a linear bruise and patterned abrasions consistent with the history given by Braylon of being struck with a belt numerous times by his father.' 

Howard's attorney told TMZ that Reed is 'shopping her baseless allegations' to Georgia authorities, even though Florida's Department of Children and Families found her claims had 'no merit'. 

His rep said: 'It is troubling to see a mother use her son as a pawn against his father,' and that Howard, 28, will do 'whatever is necessary to protect [the child's] welfare and best interests'.

DCF found the allegations credible, according to TMZ, but concluded they did not meet the standard of proof required for formal action.

Howard's attorney told TMZ that he is confident Georgia will reach the same conclusion as the Florida Department did because 'The truth is on our side'.

The case comes just two weeks after NFL star Adrian Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault - down from a felony charge of child abuse - for disciplining his son with a wooden switch.

The child, who has not been named, was left with cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records - and backlash from the public was strong. 

The Minnesota Vikings' star running back was spared jail, but has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of 2014 season.
