Union boss Len McCluskey yesterday vowed to continue his campaign to intimidate 'bad bosses' with demonstrations outside their family homes

Union boss Len McCluskey yesterday vowed to continue his campaign to intimidate ‘bad bosses’ with demonstrations outside their family homes.

The militant head of union Unite also described Labour as ‘my party’ and said he would continue to give it financial backing and try to use his influence to drive Ed Miliband further to the Left.

But Mr McCluskey, pictured, also called on the Labour leader to bring back 1970s-style collective pay bargaining for employees to prevent money ‘going to the rich’.

He added: ‘ The future of the Labour party is still very much up for scrutiny … One very wise old Labour MP said to me quite recently “the Labour party … can only exist if it is the voice of ordinary working people and trade unionists”. He was right.’

Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Mr Miliband’s party £8.4million since 2010,  defended Unite’s ‘leverage team’ which has been used to intimidate bosses and shareholders who lay off staff.

The unit was found to have bullied managers of chemicals firm Ineos and their families during last year’s Grangemouth oil refinery dispute in Scotland.

Unrepentant yesterday, he told The House magazine he did not rule anything out ‘to fight bad bosses’.

‘If you’re going to behave badly, then you’ve got to live with the consequence and those consequences are quite far-reaching’, he said.

‘Demonstrating outside directors’ homes is a different issue, it’s another arrow in our quiver, if you like.

'It’s as old as Adam. Protest is the basis of democracy.

‘It’s based on this premise: if directors make a decision to destroy jobs, to destroy communities and then disappear back into their leafy existence then they need to understand that we may well take the opportunity of making them accountable.’

He added: ‘It’s our party. This is my party. This is like my football club is Liverpool Football Club, it will never be any different. I want them to do well and I want my party to do well.’
