Explorers of the past may have had to wander deserts looking for precious sources of water while avoiding sunstroke, but now there’s a much easier way to see sandy terrains.

Google has strapped its Trekker camera to the back of camel so that Street View users can look across a vast expanse of desert dunes from the comfort of their sofa.

Viewers can see glimmers of green in the distance of the Liwa Desert in the United Arab Emirates, which are often oases, but could also be a mirage.

By using the virtual map though the desert, people  can climb sand dunes reaching towering heights of between 16ft and 147ft (5 and 45 metres) and see the views in Google Street View.

The rolling sandy hills were once home to early settlers in the Late Stone Age, making Liwa one of the historic sites in the United Arab Emirates, according to a blog post by Deanna Yick, a Street View Program Manager.

Some of the richest history in this desert lies in the Liwa Oasis - the largest oasis in the Arabian Peninsula.

Dates are grown in the oases (pictured) and their fruit is important to local cultures. Bark from the trees us used to weave Bedouin tents and baskets, while the fruit is used to make sweet treats

Many people from across the United Arab Emirates can trace their origins back to the first tribes who settled there and first established the area as a centre for trade.

The tech giant said that the use of camels allowed it to collect authentic images as well as minimally impact the environment.

Google has previously mapped the pyramids of Giza, temple of Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and the Taj Mahal in India as well as the Great Barrier Reef.

Google has previously mapped inhospitable and difficult-to-access environments in a similar way to the Liwa Desert (pictured). They include the pyramids of Giza, temple of Angkor Wat, Cambodia, as well as the Great Barrier Reef
