A man who has been charged with killing his wife and adult son allegedly told police he stabbed them because he had slept with prostitutes and feared he'd given his wife AIDS.

Eugene Maraventano, 63, told police he stabbed his wife, Janet, with a 14-inch kitchen knife as she slept in their home in Goodyear, Arizona and then killed their son, Bryan Maraventano, 27.

Maraventano told police that his wife, 63, had become ill and they thought she might have cancer. But when the tests came back negative, he concluded she must have AIDS.

He said he was worried he had contracted the disease and given it to her after frequenting prostitutes while working in New York years earlier.

Police documents do not say whether either Maraventano or his wife was positive for HIV.

He told police he did not want to leave his son without parents because he thought the man could be mentally disabled as he didn't have a girlfriend, couldn't get a job and played video games all day.

After killing his wife, he knocked on his son's bedroom door and stabbed him twice when he answered, according to police documents.

The killings occurred on Thursday, but he only called 911 on Saturday after repeatedly trying to kill himself but failing, police said.

Victim: He also took his son's life because the man couldn't get a job or girlfriend so Maraventano thought he was mentally disabled and would not be able to cope without his parents

'I killed my wife and I killed my son - I
can't kill myself,' Maraventano told a 911 dispatcher, according to 
court documents obtained by Phoneix New Times.

He tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrist, suffocating himself with a plastic bag by taping it to his face, and by putting a knife handle against the wall and pushing himself into it.

When authorities arrived at the scene, he was taken to hospital for treatment for his injuries.

Maraventano told officers that about two weeks before he carried out the murders he had decided to kill Janet but changed his mind, according to court documents.

Scene: He told police he repeatedly tried to kill himself after the murders but was unsuccessful each time

Grim discovery: He eventually called police to the home three days after he killed his wife and their son

Before initially backing out, he said he had considered buying a gun but chose a knife because 'I'm not a violent person'.

Police also found a suicide note addressed to his oldest son, explaining that he had killed his wife and younger son, the New Times reported.

Maraventano faces two counts of first-degree murder.
