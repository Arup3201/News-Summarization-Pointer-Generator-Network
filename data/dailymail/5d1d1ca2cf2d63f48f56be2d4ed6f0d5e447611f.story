David Silva attempted to put Spain's early elimination from the 2014 World Cup out of his mind as he relaxed on a beach of the sunshine isle of Ibiza.

After winning the last three consecutive major tournaments, Spain's domination of world football came to an end when a 5-1 humiliation by Holland and 2-0 loss to Chile dumped them out of the tournament with just two games played.

The Manchester City playmaker was spotted seeking solace at a beach bar on the island where he appeared relaxed with friends - including a bevy of beautiful ladies.

Despite changes needed to be made to Spain's side, former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola has no doubts that under-fire manager Vincente Del Bosque should remain in his job.

'Del Bosque is the best 
coach Spain could have and I hope he stays, because he is the right man 
to make the changes the team needs,' said the Bayern Munich manager.

'Spain made me very sad,' he added.

'Football
 owes these players so much as they have done so much for the sport, 
which means they deserved to be able to compete in the final stages.'
