Buddy Valastro, star of the hit show 'Cake Boss', learned Friday night that driving a boat in foggy conditions is no cakewalk.

Valastro, 37, who was on a 36-foot Whaler with his wife as well as two other adults and nine children between the ages of 5 and 12, experienced a few moments of fright when the boat ran into a patch of dense fog.

The boat floated into the Ambrose Channel, a heavily-trafficked portion of New York Harbor under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.

Cargo ships in New York Harbor, which would not have been able to stop in order to avoid colliding with the Cake Boss' boat

The Ambrose Channel is route where large commercial vessels pass regularly. Had Valastro's boat found itself in the path of one of the vessels, the large cargo boats, much like a speeding train, would have been unable to stop.

Fortunately, the NYPD and FDNY quickly responded, using a thermal-imaging camera to locate the boat and tow it out of the shipping lanes. The boat was then hauled back to its dock in Jersey City, New Jersey

Valastro took to social media after the mishap, posting his thanks to the city's police and fire departments on Instagram. In another Instagram post, he stated that the next time he took the boat out he would 'need to check the forecast.' He posted the picture and message with the hashtag #mywifewantstokillme.

The authorities that responded to Valastro's distress calls didn't blame him for getting lost.

'The fog rolled in like a wave,' Chris Tucker, one of the firefighters that rescued the boat, told the New York Daily News. 'It was sunny one 
moment and the next you werenâ€™t able to see what's in front of your 
boat. Even an experienced boater would tell you that isn't something you
 want to find yourself in.'

In another Instagram post, Valastro admitted that his wife was none too pleased with how their boat trip went

According to Tucker, the firefighters used a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) system to find the boat. An FLIR system uses thermal-imaging cameras to pick up heat signatures from up to 100 yards away.

No one was injured, although one of the children reportedly complained of sea sickness.

Valastro is the star of 'Cake Boss' on TLC. The season finale of the show's sixth season aired on February 24, 2014.

'Cake Boss' is a reality show which follows Valastro as he runs Carlo's Bakery, a cake shop located in Hoboken, New Jersey. The cakes made at the bakery are sold to clients nationwide. Carlo's Bakery has expanded to four locations since the inception of the show in 2009.
