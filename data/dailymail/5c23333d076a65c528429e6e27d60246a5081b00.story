Children in Need: Sir Terry Wogan and Fearne Cotton shortly before he made reference to 'recent news' while taking about sexual abuse

Children
in Need presenter Sir Terry Wogan failed to mention Jimmy Savile on 
tonight's show as he made reference to the 'awful reminder' the disgraced presenter's scandal has had on the abuse of youngsters.

Following
a performance from One Direction Sir Terry Wogan talked about the 'news
in recent weeks' before leading into a film about victims of different forms abuse.

He said: 'We know that children are vulnerable and news in recent weeks has been an awful reminder of how terrible that can be.

'Here at Children in Need we 
have been supporting children suffering all kinds of abuse, including 
sexual abuse. We hope you can help us to continue that support.'

It had been anticipated that the BBC would use this year's Children in Need to address the Jimmy Savile scandal - and it will come as no surprise that the disgraced presenter was not mentioned by name.

BBC
executives will be keeping a close eye on the public response to its 
flagship annual charity fundraising programme as it continues to air 
throughout the night.

The 
appeal is likely to be seen as a test of support for the corporation in 
light of the successive scandals that have rocked it over the past six 
weeks.

Sir Terry Wogan is once again presenting the show, which last year raised a record £46million.

The
Savile revelations and the fallout from the shelved Newsnight report 
about the late Jim'll Fix It star will inevitably cast a shadow over 
this year's six-hour fundraiser on BBC1 and BBC2.

The
BBC said the programme would be 'even bigger and better than ever' with
guests including Girls Aloud, One Direction, Olympics and Paralympics 
stars and Sir Alan Sugar, who will appear in a special edition of 
EastEnders.

Prior
to its airing BBC sources told The Guardian the programme would make 
reference to 'recent events that have been covered in the press' but 
that it was not expected to specifically mention Savile.

'There
will be some kind of reference to recent events that have been covered 
in the Press quite extensively,' said a BBC insider. 'It will also say 
that Children in Need does and always has supported children who were 
the victims of abuse and will continue to support the amazing work that 
these charities do.

Scandal: Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, 1987 and 1989

Last year the charity fundraising event chalked up a record £46million

'There will be a film to reflect that, and there was one on the same subject last year.'

Sir Roger Jones, the former chairman of Children in Need, revealed last month that Savile was secretly banned from the Children in Need appeal for being ‘creepy’.

Though
still revered elsewhere at the corporation, the presenter was kept away
from the annual fundraiser because of 'rumours' of his interest in 
young girls.

Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, 
1987 and 1989, before Sir Roger became chairman. A member of the board 
of governors between 1996 and 2002, Sir Roger said he would have stepped
down from his charity role if Savile had become involved.

The
BBC has also suffered a slump in trust among licence-fee payers as a 
result of the Savile scandal and the ensuing crisis over an inaccurate 
Newsnight report about an alleged child abuser, which led to the 
resignation of director general George Entwistle on Saturday.

The former judge who is leading a BBC inquiry into the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal has launched an appeal for witnesses.

Dame
Janet Smith, who is reviewing the corporation's practices during the 
Savile years, has called on potential victims, witnesses, people who 
worked with the TV presenter and senior staff at the time to assist with
the investigation.

According
to the inquiry's website, the review also wants to hear from people 
'who were familiar with the culture or practices of the BBC' in terms of
'preventing or enabling the sexual abuse of children, young people or 
teenagers'.

Savile became hugely famous during the 1960s and 1970s as a BBC Radio 1 DJ and presenter of Jim'll Fix It on BBC1.

He worked for the BBC between 1964 and approximately 2007, according to the review's website.

But
Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is now believed to have 
been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with hundreds of possible 
victims.

A YouGov poll published on Tuesday 
found that for the first time since it began tracking support for 
British institutions in 2003, more respondents distrust BBC journalists 
(47 per cent) than trust them (44 per cent).

YouGov
reported a slump of 13 percentage points in trust in BBC journalism the
past fortnight – suggesting the corporation's reputation has been 
harmed more by the inaccurate Newsnight report and Entwistle's 
resignation than by earlier revelations about Savile.

BBC
insiders said Savile would be the 'elephant in the room' during this 
year's appeal, but people working on the show stressed that it would be 
'business as usual to make the very best programme we can make so the 
viewers really enjoy it'.

A 
former chairman of Children In Need, Sir Roger Jones, said last month 
that the charity had made a decision to keep Savile away from the event 
because he had suspicions about the Top of the Pops presenter.

Jones,
a former BBC governor for Wales, said he always felt Savile was a 
'pretty creepy sort of character … we took the decision that we didn't 
want him anywhere near the charity and we just stepped up our child 
protection policies ,which again would have put him at risk if he tried 
anything'.

Wogan has been 
joined by BBC presenters Fearne Cotton, Tess Daly and new Radio 1 
breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw. This year's appeal will be executive 
produced by Clare Pizey.

A 
BBC spokesman said: 'Our aim this year, like every year, is to raise as 
much money as possible and we are on track to raise millions to help 
change lives of disadvantaged children across the UK.

'BBC
Children in Need has a strong track record of funding projects with a 
specific focus on supporting children and young people who are at risk 
of, or have experienced, some form of sexual abuse.

'On
Friday night, the show will feature a number of films based on the work
we fund to help disadvantaged children and young people in the UK, this
will include some of our work helping the victims of sexual abuse, as 
was the case last year.'

Last
year's Children in Need, featuring bandaged mascot Pudsey Bear, raised 
£46million, taking to more than £650million the amount of money it has 
generated since its first broadcast in 1980.

Girls
Aloud have recorded this year's Children In Need single, Something New.
Friday night's programme will also feature special editions of Strictly
Come Dancing, Top Gear and Doctor Who, and Pudsey the dog, winner of 
ITV1's Britain's Got Talent, meeting his Children In Need namesake.
