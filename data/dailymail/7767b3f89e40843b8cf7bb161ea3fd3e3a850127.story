Amy Goldberg, 57, was charged with battery on a person 65 years or older after the incident 

A Boca Raton woman is accused of smearing dog poop on her elderly neighbor's face to get revenge following argument.

Amy Goldberg is accused of putting it on her 67-year-old neighbor's face and arms last week.

Goldberg, 57, was charged with battery on a person 65 years or older. 

The smearing suspect's neighbor was walking her dog when the animal defecated on the lawn in front of Goldberg's home at the Woodfield Country Club in Boca Raton, according to an arrest report.

The neighbor said Goldberg came running out of her house screaming and yelling, the Palm Beach Post reported. 

When Goldberg told her to clean it up, the neighbor, who already had a plastic baggie in her hand, allegedly fired back: 'You clean it up.'

Goldberg allegedly grabbed the dog's mess in a bag and hurled it at her neighbor after a chase, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 

Goldberg then grabbed what was left of the pooch's poop and smeared it on her neighbor's arms and face.

After police arrived, Goldberg told them she threw the fido feces in her neighbor's direction, but maintained that she never touched her.

The 1,300 homes in the Woodfield community cost anywhere from $300,000 up to a few million dollars

Goldberg told officers the neighbor smeared the animal waste on herself to frame her for the attack because they had a long history of bad blood.  

She was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail and released.

If convicted, Goldberg could be sentenced to a minimum of three years in prison and be forced to pay fines of up to $10,000.
