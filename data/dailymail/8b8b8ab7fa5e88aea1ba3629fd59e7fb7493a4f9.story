Khloe Kardashian has launched a scathing attack on Australian morning show Sunrise after cutting off an interview over questions about her niece North West.

The reality TV star's appearance on the show was cut short on Tuesday morning and Sunrise quickly tweeted that it was due to host Samantha Armytage's line of questioning.

'We thought it was a technical glitch but turns out @KhloEkardashian's people pulled the plug after @Sam_armytage asked about baby North,' Sunrise tweeted.

'Stop reaching for a story': Khloe Kardashian has slammed Sunrise in a foul-mouthed tirade after her live cross was cut off following questions about niece North West

Khloe fired back accusing the morning show of trying to create a story out of nothing.

'Why would I cut an interview short because of North? Get over yourself Sunrise... The call dropped... stop reaching for a story,' she tweeted.

'You are so f***ing desperate!'

The 29-year-old later tweeted 'Sorry KhloMoney took my phone', referencing her outspoken alter-ego.

Sunrise executive producer Michael Pell told the MailOnline Khloe's people did pull the plug on the interview and said her local rep had apologised.

He also tweeted: 'What happened with @khloekardashian on the show is a good lesson for publicists everywhere. Don't try to censor natural conversation.'

Sunrise host David Koch fired back and called Khloe an 'idiot' later in the program.

'[My daughter] Brie's going to be very angry with me criticising Khloe, but she's an idiot,' he said.

'I'm sorry…  I'm sorry to do that.'

Awkward: Tuesday morning's Sunrise interview with the reality star was cut off

Kochie and co-host Samantha Armytage also went on air after Khloe sent the tweets to deny her claims the call was dropped due to a bad satellite.

'Our information from LA was that the plug was pulled when we talked about baby North,' Sam said.

'We were not given any information that that was off limits, you are launching a babies' clothing line which you yourself admitted was inspired by your nieces and nephews.'

Earlier in the show Khloe appeared live from LA to talk about the Kardashian Kollection's new lingerie and baby clothing lines.

Sam asked the reality star about her niece, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North West.

'And I guess the baby line is inspired by nieces and nephews starting to arrive, how's baby North going?' Sam asked.

'North is fabulous she's so beautiful,' Khloe responded.

'Penelope's obsessed with her and it's so cute to see that cousin dynamic.'

The live feed was immediately cut off following Khloe's response.

Happy birthday: Khloe posted a picture collage to Instagram thanking Robert for 'being the best brother anyone could ask for'

Perhaps Khloe is just shaky with international radio hosts, as she had another clunky moment later in the day.

During an interview with Nova's Fitzy & Wippa she abruptly stopped talking; the hosts thought she had cut out, but she was just embarrassed after swearing, thinking cussing was taboo.

After a few awkward moments of silence, she mustered up an apology, before the confused funnymen delicately assured her all was well.

Later on Tuesday Khloe tried to change the subject after her Twitter tirade by posting about brother Robert's birthday.

She posted a picture from Instagram to her Twitter account and also said that she was celebrating with Rob in LA.

'Birthday dinner and game night!!! Wooohoo #HappyBirthdayRob,' she wrote.

Also on Tuesday Khloe did an interview with Jules, Merrick, Sophie and Mel B on 2Day FM, during which she opened up about her divorce to Lamar Odom.

'It's definitely not anything I’m through. I’m going through it, but I’m not through it,' she said.

'It's really hard to watch yourself on TV too – it's definitely different in that the world has to watch too.

'It's definitely not the easiest thing to do but it's my life now I guess.'
