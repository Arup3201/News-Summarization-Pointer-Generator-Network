And with no European football to worry about, United could finally start to build some momentum.

Liverpool, who took Manchester United's place in this season's Champions League, beat Bulgarian side Ludogorets 2-1 thanks to a late Steven Gerrard penalty. 

Brendan Rodgers' side were far from impressive, but they enjoyed a considerably more successful night than Arsenal, who were comfortably beaten 2-0 by Dortmund in Germany.

Goals from Ciro Immobile and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave the hosts all three points, and the Gunners were fortunate not to concede more.

Arsene Wenger's side were beaten 2-0 by Dortmund in Germany, but the score could have been worse

Liverpool beat Bulgarian side Ludogorets Razgrad at Anfield 2-1 thanks to a late Steven Gerrard penalty
