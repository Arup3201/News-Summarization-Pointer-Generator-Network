Actor and comedian Jay Mohr incited a Twitter-storm of backlash Monday, tweeting in reaction to a massacre at the Boston Marathon that the '2nd Amendment must go. Violence has 2 stop.'

The Boston terror attacks were carried out with pressure cooker-encased explosive devices, not with firearms.

'The 2nd Amendment lends itself to the
CULTURE of violence we are living in,' he clarified later, as The Daily Caller reported, after a fan responded that his argument was 'silly. How can you connect the 2nd amendment [sic] to a terrorist act?'

Jay Mohr, who has defended violent movies in the guise of at least one on-screen character, tweeted an anti-gun rant on Monday, later saying he didn't mean to connect with Monday's Boston bombings with a call to abolish the Second Amendment

Mohr seemed to confuse the Boston Marathon bombings with a an episode of gun violence, but later clarified that he was talking in generalities

Mohr played a movie producer in the TV series Action. The character defended violence in films, saying that Hollywood gives Americans what they want

In a short-lived Fox television series called Action
that aired in 1999 and 2000, Mohr played a movie producer whose violent
and bloody productions offended members of Congress.

In one scene captured on YouTube, he 
lectures a U.S. senator, saying American audiences 'want the good guy to
win. They want the bad guy to die, hopefully in the biggest explosion the budget will allow.'

'If I'm a malignancy and my movies are cancer,' Mohr's character Peter Dragon shouts during a fictional congressional hearing, 'I hope the whole country gets cancer.'

Mohr also played a police sergeant in the 2008 Keanu Reeves action flick Street Kings, about an officer whose wife is violently gunned down and finds himself accused of viciously slaying a fellow policeman.

But responding to Twitter users who defended American gun rights, Mohr insisted that he was '[j]ust sick of watching bloodshed on TV. It's become reality tv and we're becoming numb.'

The 'Newtown tragedy was gun violence,' he said in another tweet. 'Where 
are u maniacs coming from. I'm just stating that its so sad we're 
getting used to watching it on tv.'

One Twitter reply captured the irony, advising him that 'if u want the culture of violence to stop, look in your acting mirror. Hypocrite.'

Fellow actor Adam Baldwin got in on the act, tweeting a one word assessment of Mohr's political position: 'Stupid!'

Adam Baldwin responded quickly to Mohr's tweet that the '2nd Amendment must go'

Adam Baldwin (L) pictured as Jayne Cobb in the TV program Firefly, jumped all over Jay Mohr for saying Americans should ditch their constitutional guarantee of 'the right to bear arms'

Mohr lost his temper after fans slammed him for confusing bombs with guns

Mohr later lost his temper while tweeting that he was talking generically about violence, and not about the Monday bombings in Boston.

'LISTEN! The 2nd amendment has nothing 2 do w 2day in Boston. I didn't say it did,' he wrote. The '[l]ast few times in front of tv like this was guns. F--koff.'

Mohr,
perhaps feeling pressure a day later, tweeted Tuesday that he had brought his standup comedy act to an April 14 benefit performance for a 
Wounded Warrior Project.

But the reactions to his first message were swift and vicious.

One tweeter who identifies herself as 'GOPmommy' responded to Mohr's insistence that the U.S. Constitution's 'right to bear arms' language must go. 'Just ask the 2nd amendment to follow your career and it will be gone in no time,' she wrote.

Reactions to Jay Mohr

Mohr now hosts a podcast and 
broadcasts a talk show on Fox Sports Radio. He's most famous for playing
a cynical, obnoxious sports agent in the 1996 film Jerry Maguire.

'He didn't say show me the money or anything important,' sniped a Twitter partisan.

'In fairness, he also didn't say "You complete me",' snarked another.

Mohr's spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.
