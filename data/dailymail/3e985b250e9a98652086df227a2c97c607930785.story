The nanny who became a surrogate mother to Peaches Geldof in the wake of Paula Yates' death has today paid tribute to her 'brave and beautiful girl'.

Anita Debney was employed by Bob Geldof and Paula Yates to care for their children when Peaches was a toddler.

Speaking of her shock at the 25-year-old's sudden death on Monday, Ms Debney said. 'She has been the greatest joy, the greatest blessing, the most tender part of my heart and soul.

'I loved her through the good times and the bad. We struggled and survived the darkest of times.

Devoted: Ms Debney was employed by Bob Geldof and Paula Yates when Peaches was a toddler. She is expected to play a key role in helping to bring up Peaches' two sons, Astala, 23 months and Phaedra, 11 months

Bereft: The body of Peaches Geldof has been released to the family as her father Sir Bob has been spending time with her children Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months, at the family home of husband Tom Cohen

Close: Sir Bob has been spending time with his daughter's children as the family continue to grieve her death this week

Poignant: Peaches will have her funeral at the church of St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence in Davington, Kent, where she was married and her mother Paula's funeral was also held

'She overcame so much and my love and appreciation of her indomitable spirit never wavered.

'The
 joy we shared in her beautiful babies was so deep and meaningful and 
filled both of our hearts with love and devotion,' she told The Mirror. 'She blossomed in 
motherhood and excelled at raising the sweetest, happiest babies in the 
world... You almost made it.'

Ms Debney is expected to play a role in helping to bring up Peaches' two sons, and her godsons, Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, who will turn one later this month.

The emotional tribute came as Peaches' body was released to her family so they can plan her funeral.

It
 is expected to be held at the Kent church where she married in 2012 and
 where her mother Paula Yates' memorial service took place in 2000.

Her
 father Sir Bob Geldof has also been spending time with her sons Astala,
 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months, at the family home of his son-in-law
 Tom Cohen in south-east London.

Peaches' second husband is looking after 
their children with the help of his parents, who greeted Mr Geldof and 
his partner Jeanne Marine with a hug yesterday afternoon.

The Kent coroner's admission that they no longer hold Peaches' body means that her grieving family can now plan her funeral.

It could be held at Davington Church near Faversham, Kent,  where she married Mr Cohen, lead singer of the band Scum, in September 2012.

Her parents were also married at the church 26 years ago and it is where her mother Paula Yates' funeral was also held in 2000.

Grief: In 2000 Paula Yates' funeral was held at the church where her daughter would later marry

A source said: 'The church holds the 
most bittersweet of memories for the Geldof family. They have had the 
best of times and the worst of times in that churchyard.'

She was just 11 when her mother died 
after a heroin overdose. The last message she posted online on Sunday evening was a picture of her as a toddler
 with her mother.

The 
25-year-old had spoken of feeling the presence of her late mother keenly
 as she walked down the aisle of St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence 
Church.

Speaking to 
Hello! magazine at the time of her wedding to Tom Cohen in 2012, she 
said: ‘I feel her [Yates] presence all the time but especially today. 
Mum loved family celebrations and she would adore Tom and the fact that 
we’ve married here. I know she is watching over me and feeling so happy 
for us.’

Peaches was found
 dead at her Kent country home on Monday in ‘unexplained’ circumstances 
and a post-mortem examination yesterday was 'inconclusive' about the 
cause.

'Inconclusive': A post mortem has been held at Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, but a cause of death was not established

A post-mortem examination carried out 
at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford proved inconclusive, prompting 
further investigations to try to establish her cause of death.

It
 is understood that police found no suicide note and no signs of injury 
or evidence of drugs.

Any inquest is not expected to be opened and adjourned by the coroner until after the results of the toxicology tests are known.

Her father led the tributes which flooded in after her death.

In a touching tribute signed by the Live Aid organiser, his partner Jeanne Marine, and Ms Geldof's sisters Fifi Trixibelle, Pixie and Tiger, they said the family was 'beyond pain', saying: 'She was the wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us.'

Investigation: Police continue to scour Peaches Geldof's home in Wrotham, Kent, where she was found dead

Peaches had a house in the country, worth nearly £1million, pictured, where forensic officers were searching for evidence

Looking for clues: Forensic teams were spotted walking in and out of her home with trained sniffer dogs - but sources have said there was no signs of injury, drugs or a suicide note

Ms Geldof's husband, musician Tom 
Cohen, with whom she had two young sons, said his wife was adored by him
 and their two sons, whom he would bring up 'with their mother in their 
hearts every day'.

Ms 
Geldof's elder sister Fifi posted a picture on Instagram of the two of 
them together when they were children, writing: 'My beautiful baby 
sister... Gone but never forgotten. I love you Peaches x.'

A prolific tweeter, the final message she sent on Sunday was a picture of herself as a child with her mother, with the message 'Me and my mum'.

In a column for Mother & Baby magazine, she wrote that she was now 'happier than ever' after becoming a mother.

Advice: Peaches Geldof was warned by doctors in 2011, left, about her junk food diet, so she gave up eating McDonald's, pizza and chips every day and lost weight, pictured right just before her death

It emerged today that she ate 
McDonald's, pizza and chips every day until doctors warned that her junk
 food diet was putting her health at risk.

The
 25-year-old admitted before her death she had cholesterol problems in 
2011 and 'the heart of a 90-year-old gangster' so decided to lose 
weight.

Friends had
 said she looked thin before she died, leading to speculation her weight
 loss may have put pressure on her heart. She had said her juice diet 
helped her lose 11lb in a month.

'I
 had cholesterol and the doctors said stop eating s***. So I did. If you
 stop eating pizza and chips you then don't look like you used to,' she 
said at a film premiere in 2011.

'Do I really look that thin? Let's be honest. How did I do it? I just stopped eating McDonald's and f****** s*** every day.

'I
 used to eat s*** every single day. I used to wake up with my boyfriend 
and eat crap. I had the heart of a 90-year-old gangster.'
