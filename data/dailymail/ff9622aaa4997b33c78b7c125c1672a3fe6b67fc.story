When it comes to losing their virginity, most women wait for the right man, while others prefer to wait for the right price.

Elizabeth Raine, 27, has decided to auction off her virginity online and hopes to get at least $400,000 for the exchange.

‘The reason mainly was the money,’ Miss Raine tells MailOnline.

Elizabeth Raine, pictured here, has started a blog in which she is detailing her journey from being a virgin to a 'whore,' as she auctions off her virginity online

‘I have no emotional attachment whatsoever to my virginity and never have, which is why it’s so easy for me to do this.

‘More to the point, why would I NOT want to do it?

‘It’s a compelling and easy way to make money.’

Miss Raine says she understand that, for some women, losing their virginity is a significant moment in their lives.

But, according to her, it’s merely  a physical act and this is nothing more than a business  transaction.

‘Sex is just sex,’ she says.

Miss Raine has never had any form of sex, including letting a man see her naked.

Nor has she seen a naked man in the flesh.

‘I’ve dated but for no more than two to three months and have never had a boyfriend because I’ve never felt anyone I’ve connected that strongly to and who’s made me think that sex is anything more than a physical act.

‘I like guys but I’ve just never felt strongly enough for anyone or had a real emotional connection.

‘I study, work on projects and spend time with my friends and that’s enough for me.

While her friends have been largely supportive, Miss Raine’s brother – understandably - isn’t so keen on the idea of his sister auctioning off her virginity to the highest bidder.

‘My friends think it’s my choice and trust me implicitly, but my brother definitely has some moral objections to the idea,’ she says.

‘It hasn’t affected our relationship. He knows I am smart and trusts me to execute it properly.’What is perhaps even more surprising, is Miss Raine’s unequivocal support from her parents, who she says accepted the choice ‘easily.’

In her blog, 27-year-old Elizabeth Raine, pictured here, writes that she is comfortably off and isn't simply selling her virginity for cash - she claims she will donate 35 per cent to charity

‘They could tell I’d given it a lot of thought and that I was smart enough to do it properly,’ she says.

Miss
 Raine started her blog, Musings of a Virgin Whore, ‘several months’ 
ago, though her various posts date back to February 1st 2014.

In
 her posts, she answers questions such as, ‘Isn’t this prostitution?’ 
‘What kind of doctor will a girl like me be?’ and ‘Can a virgin whore 
still be a feminist?'

Because
 prostitution is largely illegal in the US, Miss Raine has found an 
agent and publicist in Sydney, Australia, where prostitution laws are more relaxed and
 will, as Miss Raine says, ‘permit this exchange.’

She will be deciding on the winning bidder, and maintains that her endeavour is ‘100 per cent legal.’

She will be paying taxes and even donating 35 per cent of her fortune to charity, though would prefer not to disclose which one.

Miss Raine is a medical student in the US, but has not disclosed at which college.

The
 photos on her blog show her slim body in a tight, slinky black dress 
with her blonde hair but face out of the eye of the camera.

In an interview with Elite Daily, Miss Raine said she hopes to earn upwards of $400,000 from the auction, which she expects to last for roughly a month.

‘I don’t really know how the bids will work, my agent will be handling it all,’ Miss Raine tells Mail Online.

She will ‘probably’ go for the highest bidder, as long as she has no ‘major objections.’

‘I don’t care who he is really, as long as he’s not a psychopath and we get on well, then I’ll be happy,' she says.

'We’ll do some sort of background check and I’ll definitely have communication with him beforehand, probably a few emails and a Skype.

‘If I feel unsafe at any point I'll not go through with it, but I don't feel strongly that I need to meet him beforehand.’

Whilst Miss Raine says she hasn’t ironed out all the details of the exchange, she says that for his payment the winner will receive 12 hours in her company in a high end hotel, with security and her friends and family knowing where she is at all times.

‘I won’t have anyone waiting outside the room with a baseball bat or anything,’ she says.

And
 anyone hoping for a Pretty Woman-style ending, with a couple falling in
 love after he’s paid her for sex, will be left disappointed.

‘I have a good understand of what this is and know myself well enough to know that it won’t affect me emotionally

It’s nothing more than a one-night exchange and unlikely I’ll form any emotional attachment.

‘I mean, any girl runs that risk when they sleep with a man, whether or not she’s being paid.’
