A Chinese man spent five hours on top of a high voltage pylon after the pressure of being in debt became too much.

Peng Hsieh, 21, had reportedly cracked after borrowing money from several local people including his family to fund his education and then finding he was unable to get a job and couldn't pay it back.

The young man had climbed up 24-metre high voltage tower in Foshan, in Guangdong province, in southeast China.

Risky: A young man climbed a high voltage pylon after cracking under the pressure he felt about being in debt

Pressure: Peng Hsieh, 21, had reportedly cracked after borrowing money from several local people including his family to fund his education

Performance: Peng Hsieh spent the hours singing and performing gymnastic tricks

Cause: His father said: 'I know he had been feeling under a lot of pressure with people constantly coming round demanding that he stop paying the money back but he just didn't have it and we couldn't afford to help him any more'

He was spotted by a local who raised the alarm with the electricity officials who cut off the power supply.

In total he remained at the top of 
the pylon for five hours doing his gymnastic performances and singing 
popular Chinese songs, ignoring requests from family and friends to come
down.

Only towards the end
after having stripped off his shirt and his shoes did he finally agreed
to come down when some of his creditors confirmed they would no longer 
pursue him so rigorously to get the money back.

Talked around: The man was finally persuaded to climb down the structure by the rescuers

Removed: The man is brought back down in a cherry picker after being removed

His
father Yang said: 'I know he had been feeling under a lot of pressure 
with people constantly coming round demanding that he stop paying the 
money back but he just didn't have it and we couldn't afford to help him
any more. He had hoped to get a good job after graduating.'

He
said he had been unable to speak to his son since the stunt but he was 
hoping they could sort something out to remove the pressure.

He added: 
'If he kills himself nobody will get anything back, they just need to be
patient.'

Peng Hsieh is likely to be fined though for the stunt so they may have to wait a while longer than was planned.
