Women are often encouraged to spend a fortune on small tubs of the latest anti-ageing cream or designer make-up, but it seems budget beauty also has its appeal.

A £1 cosmetics range from Poundland, which has won plaudits from fashion magazine Vogue, is reporting remarkable sales.

Just two months after the launch of the Make Up Gallery range, the company has had to freight in extra stock to keep up with demand in the run-up to Christmas.

Huge demand: Just two months after the launch of the £1 Make Up Gallery range, Poundland has had to freight in extra stock to keep up with demand in the run-up to Christmas

The range includes more than 100 items, from long-lasting foundations with UVA/UVB filters to concealers, pressed powder with Vitamin E, quick-dry nail varnishes, vibrant eye make-up and lipsticks.

More than one million Make Up Gallery items have been sold across 450 stores since October. Sales have been helped by a positive review on the website of fashion and beauty bible, Vogue magazine.

Its reviewer raved over the £1 liquid eyeliner, declaring: ‘The brush is so precise it creates the finest of flicks with utmost precision and the smudge-factor matches that of its most esteemed counterparts.’

Rave review: Vogue's reviewer was particularly happy with the Time To Shine quick-dry nail varnish

She added: ‘The Gorgeous Flawless Long Lasting Foundation creates a silky smooth veil without being cakey.’

The writer was particularly happy with the Time To Shine quick-dry nail varnish, saying: ‘The wide brush made application a dream and the colour came out so rich, I ended up only applying one coat. Add that to the nominal drying time (four minutes and totally budge-proof) and you’ve got a formula to rival the best in the business.’

Jim McCarthy, chief executive of Poundland, said: ‘We are incredibly proud of the Make Up Gallery range and are amazed and delighted by the response we have had for this collection.

‘We had no doubt that this range would be popular – it was a new and stylish range which offered fantastic value – but the reaction so far has exceeded all expectations and we’ve had to call in extra stock just to keep up.’

The products have been particularly popular with shoppers in the North of England, with stores there topping sales lists for the retailer.

Poundland believes customers stock up on the make-up ahead of a big night out, with the majority of sales taking place on Saturdays.
