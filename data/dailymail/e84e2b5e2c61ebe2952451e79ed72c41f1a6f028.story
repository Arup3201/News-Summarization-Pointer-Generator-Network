The freight train filled with its grisly cargo of death last night finally pulled out of the station where it had sat for almost two days.

While accusations of mistreatment flew around the world, the stench grew in the heat as two more truckloads of remains were loaded to join those packed into body bags inside four refrigerated carriages.

Ukrainian officials said 282 corpses have been found, along with 87 fragments from 16 bodies. There are fears some body parts may have been incinerated as aircraft wreckage exploded.

Finally: The refrigerated train carrying the bodies of MH17 crash victims has finally set off from rebel-held Torez in eastern Ukraine four days after the disaster

Remains: The train is carrying the bodies of 282 victims and 87 fragments from a further 16, Ukrainian officials said. The rest were incinerated

Almost 200 of the bodies were packed 
on to the train in Torez station, about nine miles from the main crash 
site, while obscene arguments raged over the conducting of forensic 
investigations.

Rebel 
militia have been accused of wilfully allowing the site’s desecration. 
Bodies were left out for two days in sweltering heat while possessions 
were looted and picked over. Some items even caught fire in the hot sun 
yesterday, shortly before the search of the crash site was declared 
over.

Russian sources said last night the grey freight train containing the bodies was moving to the regional capital, Donetsk.

The ultimate destination is expected to be the city of Kharkiv, currently loyal to Kiev.

Luggage: As pro-Russian separatists prepared the train to set off from the station in Torez, the passengers' luggage was also driven over from the site

Loading: The bodies of the victims were ferried from the site to a station in rebel-held Torez using rubbish trucks today

Grim: Families have hit out at officials on the site after these pictures emerged of men in gas masks climbing over bodies and dragging them into the train

Dutch forensics arrived at the site to identify the bodies that will now be handed to officials in the Netherlands, which lost 173 civilians

Almost 200 victims were piled high in the sweltering heat in eastern Ukraine in the village near Grabovo controlled by pro-Russian separatists

Workers donned protective suits to unload the bodies and remains, many of which were badly burned in the crash, before loading them into the train

The operation appeared to be run efficiently despite accusations that rebel militia willfully allowed the site to be tampered with and destroyed

This is one of the images that enraged relatives of the 298 dead as their loved ones were shovelled into the back of a rubbish van

A
 team of 12 Malaysian aviation investigators arrived in Donetsk last 
night.

According to their country’s prime minister, the group’s chief 
was due to be handed the aircraft’s black boxes.

It was also reported 
that a deal had been reached with pro-Russian militia to allow the 
investigatory team ‘safe access’ to the crash site.

For
 much of the day, militia men strutted around cradling assault rifles 
outside the faded white station building in Torez as they held hostage 
the human remains of people their forces almost certainly killed.

They allowed Dutch investigators to examine the bodies for the first 
time, while a team of international observers from the Organisation for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe oversaw the loading of the 
most-recently discovered remains.

I watched as human remains were placed on the train with a sickening lack of decorum. 

Guards: The claims attempting to implicate Ukraine in the MH17 disaster came as rebel soldiers continued to stand guard over the corpses in Torez, eastern Ukraine, where they are left in refrigerated train carriages (pictured in the background)

Standing watch: A separatist soldier stands just outside Torez train station, where the 200 bodies are being kept

On the scene: Rebels armed with AK-47s were surrounding the train carriages today, which before had been openly accessible to members of the public

Escort: A Dutch forensics expert, centre in blue and orange, was seen flanked by armed men coming back from the train carriages

A
 blue dumper truck pulled up close to the carriage, while the guards 
said they were waiting for a worker with ‘specialist equipment’ to open 
the doors.

After the 
international observers arrived, protected by members of the security 
force supposed to have been disbanded after the February killing of 
protesters in Kiev that sparked the Ukraine crisis, this worker turned 
up with a hammer to force a door lever.

Another
 man in an orange fluorescent vest climbed on to the truck and casually 
slung a black bag containing body parts to a colleague on the train, 
while the station manager covered her face at the stench.

‘The smell is simply horrible,’ admitted one of the militia from two separate paramilitary groups who were guarding the train.

Horrifying: The bodies are dumped in rubbish trucks by rescue workers. Despite criticism, militiamen insist they are doing everything they can for the dead

Hauling: Rescue workers spent hours upon hours moving bodies around the site, which had lain where they fell for days

Efforts: Emergency workers have now recovered the vast majority of victims bodies from the crash site

Like
 other rebels, he insisted the dead were being treated with dignity.

‘It
 is horrible to see all these women and children lying dead,’ he said. 
‘It is one thing when you see men killed on a battlefield but this is 
quite different.’

Inside the
 train, one of the rail staff was making a cup of tea for himself.

‘We 
do not know of the final destination,’ he insisted.

‘We have not been told when we are leaving or where we are going.’ 
Ukrainian officials in Kharkiv, nearly 200 miles from the crash scene, 
say they have been expecting the remains since Saturday after an 
agreement with rebel leaders in Donetsk.

The
 town has prepared a special refrigerated warehouse to receive the 
bodies and put scores of hotel rooms on standby for relatives. More than
 30 bodies are understood to have already been taken to a hospital 
morgue in Donetsk.

Row on row: The bagged victims were gathered and piled onto vehicles before being taken to a train station in rebel-held Torez, nine miles from the crash site

Piled up: Rescue workers are pictured above at the MH17 crash site in Grabovo, eastern Ukraine, moving bodies onto trucks

Loading up: The rescue workers were seen holding up the back of the truck with a stick while the bodies were tossed on board

Aftermath: Black bags are still being taken from the crash site by rescue workers

Horrifying: The international community has expressed outrage over the undignified scene - with swarms of flies buzzing around the train

Dirty work: Some of the emergency services laid flowers on the bagged-up bodies, as outrage at their treatment intensified across the world

Cleared: Two workers prepare the vehicle for the corpses at a crash site in Grabovo

Pro-Russian guards at the scene arrested several journalists making 
inquiries on Sunday, although one militia man there confirmed to me that
 some bodies were inside.

Earlier yesterday, Ukraine accused rebels of blocking the train’s departure.

‘We managed to load 192 bodies and eight body parts of the innocent 
victims of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 flight on to a special 
train,’ said vice prime minister Volodymyr Hroisman.

‘The train has not left the station, for the terrorists are blocking 
the way. We are in constant negotiations with them regarding the 
transportation of the bodies of the victims.’

Australia’s foreign minister condemned using bodies of murdered people as political pawns in a conflict.

‘It is time for these bodies to be brought home and it’s time for an 
investigation into who is responsible for this atrocity to begin,’ said 
Julie Bishop.

In Holland, 
home to the biggest number of victims, King Willem-Alexander made a rare
 televised address after meeting victims’ relatives. ‘This terrible 
disaster has left a deep wound in our society.

The scar will be visible and tangible for years to come,’ he said.
