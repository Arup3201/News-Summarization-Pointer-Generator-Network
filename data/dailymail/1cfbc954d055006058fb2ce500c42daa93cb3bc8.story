Missing: Police believe Mother-of-three Rania Alayed, 25, was killed and her body buried by a roadside

The body of a missing mother-of-three is believed to be buried or concealed along a 19-mile stretch of rural road, police have said.

Rania Alayed, 25, was reported missing from her home in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, on July 2 - nearly a month after she was last seen in public on the evening of June 7.

Ms Alayad's husband Ahmed Khatib, 33, and his brother Muhanned Mahmood Al Khatib, 38, have now both been charged with murder.  Ms Alayad's brother-in-law has also been charged with perverting the course of justice.

Police believe she was taken in a white camper van in the early hours of June 8 to the Thirsk area of North Yorkshire, where her body was disposed.

The Leyland DAF 200 vehicle, 
registration number F864 RJB, is believed to have stopped in an 
unidentified layby on the northbound A19.

Officers from Greater Manchester Police 
(GMP), supported by teams from North Yorkshire and aerial assistance 
from the RAF, are now searching for her body along the 30km stretch of the A19 between the junctions of the A168 and the A172 at Osmotherley.

Letters have been sent to 350 motorists who are known to have driven in the area between 3am and 5am on June 8 to see if they have any information on the movements of the camper van, which has since been recovered.

Ms Alayed previously lived in Norton, Stockton-On-Tees, and moved to Manchester in January.

Her disappearance was described by police as 'extremely out of character'.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is also investigating how GMP dealt with previous contact with Ms Alayed, who reported being a victim of domestic violence.

Detective Chief Inspector Peter Marsh, of GMP, said: 'We believe Rania is on that stretch of road.

Appeal: Police are appealing for any information about this camper van which they believe may have been used to dispose of the body of Rania Alayad

'We are now satisfied that from the 8th of June there is nothing to suggest that Rania is alive.

'It is a huge search and it is a case of narrowing it down. The area is farming land with open fields and ditches around.

'We believe the Rania's body is buried or concealed somewhere.

'We are hoping to hear from anyone who saw this white camper van and, in particular, if they saw it parked by the side of the road or in a layby.

'I am also interested to hear from anyone walking in the area or working who may have seen some suspicious activity or come across any unusual areas of ground such as a disturbance, cut vegetation.

Investigation: Police outside the homes of Rania's husband Ahmed Khatib in Gorton, Manchester, after he was charged with murder of the missing mother-of-three

'We have been working closely with our colleagues in North Yorkshire Police and have used specialist search equipment supplied by the military to help locate her.

'As Rania still remains missing, it is crucial that we go to the next stage and publicly appeal for information. If you believe you saw Rania after 7pm on 7th June 2013, we are keen to hear from you.' 

Anyone with information on the movements of the white camper van should contact the Major Investigation Team on 0161 856 4711.

The two men accused of Ms Alayed's murder are next due in court in October.
