In a candid interview airing next week on Dateline, 40-year-old Danica Weeks describes the agony of losing the love of her life on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370

On March 8, 2014, 39-year-old Paul Weeks boarded seat 1C, business class, on the routine passenger flight which departed from Kuala Lumpur and was bound for Beijing.

The 40-year-old-mother will describe the agony of constantly wondering what happened to him on the program.

She's frustrated with Malaysian authorities, claiming they've simply refused to answer her questions.

'They just won't tell us. I can only hope we get something, anything,' she says while fighting back tears in a trailer for the program. 

'They are wanting to put this aside. In their own words - to move beyond MH370. How do you move? We don't get to move beyond! We will never get to move beyond. So how can they just move beyond this and forget about it?' 

The program will also tracks the developments, false alarms and disappointments in the year-long hunt for MH370 through Mrs Weeks's eyes.

Despite the most expensive search and rescue operation in history, not a single trace of the plane, or its passengers and crew has been found.

Danica Weeks still can't fathom how Malaysia Flight 370 disappeared and took away her husband on March 8

Paul Weeks is among the 239 lost souls on the MH370 aircraft, which still remains missing

In an interview with The Weekend Australian in September, the 40-year-old says her life stopped the moment she was informed that her 39-year-old husband was among the 239 lost souls when Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crashed into a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean.

This wasn't part of their grand plan - of moving to Perth, leading a simple family life and most importantly growing old together.  

The couple first met 14 years ago at Oktoberfest in Munich. From then on, romance blossomed and they pair lived together in London  until they relocated to Christchurch in New Zealand - Mr Weeks' hometown.

But following the earthquakes, they decided to make the move to Perth in 2011 where they wanted to settle down and raise their two kids.

On March 8, Mr Weeks boarded MH370 so he could make his way to Mongolia to start his new fly-in-fly-out job as a mechanical engineer. 

His precious final moments are ingrained in Mrs Weeks' memories, as she revealed that her husband gave her his watch and wedding ring amid concerns that something may happen to him at the mining site.

He requested the wedding ring was to go to the first son who gets married and the watch to the second.

But for now, Mrs Weeks keeps the ring close to her heart by wearing it around her neck. 

'Every night now I go home and it's lonely, it's very lonely. When you've had someone there for 14 years, how do you keep going when they're gone?'

While Mrs Weeks herself isn't able to put piece the puzzle together herself, she was left with the harrowing task of explaining to her two sons what happened to their father.

For eldest son Lincoln, who's understood that his daddy has gone to work forever, he's left anxious that the same will happen to his mother. 

'That's why I won't rest until I find out what happened to Pauly. That's why I won't let [Malaysia Airlines] treat him like a seat number. I have to keep him alive. And I won't rest until we find out what happened to him and to everyone else on that plane,' she said.

As for the second devastating Malaysia Airlines disaster, where a plane flying over the Russian-Ukraine conflict was shot down on July 17 and claimed 298 lives, the pain of loss and bewilderment hit too close to home for Mrs Week.

'Just feel so heart broken, all over again, for all the families of MH17,' she wrote on her Facebook.

The 39-year-old mechanical engineer, from New Zealand, was a dedicated father to his two sons

On board the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 were 12 crew members and 227 passengers

Meanwhile, the search continues for the doomed Boeing 777 as air crash investigators hope to further narrow down the planned search area to find the aircraft within the next year.

The plane vanished with 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board after it departed Kuala Lumpar in Malaysia to Beijing in China.

Upon several failed aerial searches to spot any wreckage from the airliner,experts have studied radar and satellite data in a bid to close in on the crash site.
