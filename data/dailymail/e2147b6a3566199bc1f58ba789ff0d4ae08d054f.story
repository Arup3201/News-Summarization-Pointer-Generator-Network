The 2012 London Olympics were the second most watched event in American TV history, early Nielsen ratings show.

But in the final hours of its Olympic coverage Sunday, the network gave viewers a good laugh when NBC sportscasters spotted actor Jesse Eisenberg watching the basketball game between Team USA and Spain, and praised the 28-year-old for his social media prowess.

When the camera spotted Eisenberg, who portrayed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, the commentator noted that he would 'put the picture on Facebook,' according to video from Deadspin.

'We've got every executive of note, it 
seems worldwide, attending these games,' he added, seemingly unaware 
that the curly-haired male watching the game was not in fact the Silicon
Valley darling.

Regardless, NBC was enjoying its second place finish for its Olympic coverage.

A total of 210.5 million people tuned in to catch the 2012 London Olympics on 
the first 14 days, across NBCUniversal’s networks that include NBC, NBC 
Sports Network, MSNBC, CNBC, Telemundo and Bravo. 

The 2012 viewership surpassed the audience of 209 million who watched the
1996 Atlanta Olympics but lagged behind the 215 million U.S. viewers for the 2008 Beijing Games.

The Peacock Network spent an estimated $1.18 billion for the television 
rights to air the 2012 Summer Olympics and reportedly shelled out $100 
million for production costs, staffing and the construction of a 
70,500-square-foot NBC broadcast facility in Olympic Park.

But media insiders say the Comcast-owned network failed to secure enough
ad dollars to break even, with advertising revenue topping $1 
billion, though NBC will more than likely profit from footage of the 
games that is used in years to come.

Mark Levy, vice president and creative director for NBC Sports, told the
Associated Press how his department worked to develop campaigns that 
mixed the editorial and advertising to entice advertisers.

He helped Visa with its Morgan Freeman-narrated ads, that salute specific
athletic achievements shortly after they take place, as well as Procter
& Gamble's heart-warming campaign saluting mothers - that NBC supplements by 
interviewing athletes like Gabby Douglas and Kerri Walsh Jennings about 
their own moms.

'Storytelling has been our philosophy for so many games,' Levy said. 'We
do hear from our viewers that they love to hear the back stories of 
these kids.'

The summer games also introduced some new NBC 
News faces -- like American Idol host and E! producer Ryan Seacrest, in addition to giving the spotlight to newly
crowned Today show co-host Savannah Guthrie.

It also gave the Today franchise a much needed ratings boost, after the 
morning program has gone head-to-head with its ABC rival, Good Morning 
America.
