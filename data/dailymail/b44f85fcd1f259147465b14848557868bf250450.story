Hundreds of ISIS extremists like Mohammed Emwazi have been free to leave Britain because they are not being properly monitored

Hundreds of ISIS extremists like Mohammed Emwazi have been free to leave Britain because they were not being properly monitored by the security services, the Government has admitted.

Young men on the fringes of terror groups were not investigated thoroughly by the police and intelligence agencies, allowing them to leave for Syria, a report has revealed.

It has also been revealed that MI5 and Scotland Yard are observing  3,000 people in the UK that they fear could become another Jihadi John.

Counter-terror investigators from the police and security services have launched Project Danube, a joint unit which will examine 'the levels of risk posed by low-level subjects of interest', The Times reported.

The operation will monitor people who were previously not thoroughly examined as officers followed leads which posed a greater risk.

The move will heap yet more pressure on Britain's intelligence agencies, which are said to have more than 3,000 fanatics in the UK on their terror watch list. 

Many of these are feared to be 'lone wolves' who have never joined a terrorist group or travelled abroad.

The figure is far higher than previous estimates, which put the number of extremists being monitored in 2007 at 2,000.

The number of potentially dangerous men and women grew with the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, according to the Financial Times. 

Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the think-tank Rusi, said: 'There have always been a lot of people [under watch]. But the perception for a long time was that the numbers had plateaued.

'Now there is a whole new layer on top of that because the noise from ISIS in Syria and Iraq is so loud it is attracting others.'

The new focus on individuals rather than terrorist networks is thought to be a reaction to the cases of Emwazi  and the killers of Lee Rigby - Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right)

The new focus on individuals rather than terrorist networks is thought to be a reaction to the cases of Emwazi - unmasked as Jihadi John this week - and the killers of  Lee Rigby.

Adebolajo, one of the men who brutally murdered the fusilier in a street in Woolwich, and Emwazi were part of the same radicalised group that emerged in London in 2007.

Both tried to travel to Somalia to join terrorists Al-Shabaab but were stopped by intelligence officers, after which they are said to have remained on MI5's watchlist.

Former head of MI6 Sir John Sawers said the threat from terrorism in Britain had gone up over the last three years

Emwazi was on a no-fly list but was still able to leave Britain by ferry, from where he made his way to Syria, it is believed.

Security chiefs have warned senior MPs that if they are to successfully monitor more people, especially those who are not part of conventional terrorist groups, they will need more powers, including those allowing them to snoop on online communications.

Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6, said: 'Every society has to set out to what extent can the authorities intrude on individuals' privacies in order to protect the wider society - and maybe that balance is shifting a bit.

'Certainly the threat that we face from terrorists here in the UK has gone up over the last three years and there has to be some response to that.

'What we don't want to do is wait for some ghastly 7/7-style terrorist attack here in the UK before political opinion changes,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 

David Cameron yesterday voiced his support for the security services. He said: 'They are having to make incredibly difficult judgements, and I think basically they make very good judgements on our behalf.

'I think while we are in the middle of this vast effort to make sure British citizens are safe, the most important thing is to get behind them.'
