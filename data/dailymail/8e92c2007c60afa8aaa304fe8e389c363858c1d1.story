Roberto Martinez believes Everton were denied the chance to sign Tom Cleverley on transfer deadline day as Manchester United regard them as a threat.

Martinez, who had worked with Cleverley at Wigan, wanted to take the England international on a season-long loan but Everton were forced to pull out of negotiations at a late stage.

Cleverley subsequently joined Aston Villa on loan but should things not work out for him in Birmingham, Martinez has hinted he would be interested in signing him next summer.

Tom Cleverley has left Manchester United on loan and will spend the season at Aston Villa

‘I am a big admirer of Tom,’ said Martinez. ‘That was an opportunity that we explored on the last day of the window but it couldn't happen for different reasons. I don't think there was just one aspect.

‘It's the parent club that makes that decision. Maybe they just didn't want to send a player on loan to a club that is going to be challenging for things and finished above them last season, I don't know.’

Relations between Everton and Manchester United were strained last summer, following David Moyes leaving Goodison Park to move to Old Trafford and United’ s subsequent aggressive pursuit of Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini.

‘I don't think there is any bad feeling between the clubs (following Fellaini/Baines),’ said Martinez. ‘The chairman (Bill Kenwright) has a very good relationship with Manchester United and, as a football club, we are not carrying any sour grapes about anything.

‘Our information was that the player wasn't available on loan full stop. You can look at the table from last season and we finished fifth and they finished a bit lower, so from that respect you can understand.

‘But, at the same time, Aston Villa have started the season really well. They are going to be a strong team. But we can't comment on that, it is down to Manchester United. A situation with Cleverley came up that I was happy to explore. In the end it didn't work out.’
