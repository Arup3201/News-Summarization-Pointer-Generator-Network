Manchester United have reported record annual revenue of £433.2million and profits of £23.8m for the financial year 2013-2014.

The club's sponsorship revenue increased by 49 per cent and commercial revenue soared nearly a quarter to £189.3m.

But it cost the club £5.2m to sack manager David Moyes and his coaching staff and projections show their revenue is expected to fall by 10 per cent to between £385m-£395m in the current financial year because of their failure to qualify for the Champions League.

Financial update: Man United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward proclaimed himself pleased with the club's latest set of finances as they recorded a record annual revenue of £433m

Compensation: It cost United £5.2m to sack David Moyes and his coaching staff last seaosn

United's wage bill rose 19 per cent to £214.8m, an increase of £34.3m, 'primarily due to the impact of player acquisitions and renegotiated player contracts', according to the annual report.

This is the first time United's wage bill has broken the £200m barrier and they are only the second club after Man City to exceed it. This is before the summer acquisitions of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao, Marco Rojo, Daley Blind, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera have their impact.

The figures also reveal United's sponsorship income increased by 49 per cent last year with a number of new deals coming on stream. 

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: 'We are very proud of the results achieved in fiscal year 2014 as we once again generated record revenues driven by our commercial and broadcasting businesses which delivered impressive year-over-year growth.

New chapter: Ed Woodward said he was looking forward to success under Louis van Gaal

'We also recently announced a record-breaking deal with Adidas and very much look forward to launching this partnership next summer.

'With Louis van Gaal at the helm as manager, and the recent signing of some of the world's leading players to further strengthen our squad, we are very excited about the future and believe it's the start of a new chaper in the club's history.

'Louis' footballing philosophy fits very well with Manchester United and he has an impressive track record of success throughout his career, winning league titles with every club he has managed.'

Woodward added that despite United's summer spending spree he expects the wage bill drop to due to the exits of high earns Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand Nemanja Vidic.  

Growth: United posted record revenues in 2013-2014 but the boom isn't expected to last long

United finished seventh in the Barclays Premier League last season, their lowest finish in the post-1992 era, and failed to make the Champions League for the first time since 1995.

It led to the dismissal of Moyes and the appointment of Louis van Gaal over the summer.

United have spent in the region of £150m over the summer on Di Maria, Herrera, Shaw, Rojo, Blind and Falcao as they bid to reassert their dominance in the top flight.

The club also concluded the largest kit sponsorship deal in history with Adidas, worth £750m over a 10-year period.
