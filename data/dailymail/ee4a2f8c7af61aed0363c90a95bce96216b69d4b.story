A strange reenactment of a replica of a big whale being harpooned has been used as a source of entertainment at a festival in Japan.

Hundreds of people turned up to watch the bizarre display at the Kayoi Whale Festival in Nagato on Sunday where locals dressed in nothing but red loin cloths and headbands pretending to be traditional whalers hunting down the mock-up whale.

People of all ages were engrossed by the performance where the make-believe whalers speared the fake mammal, threw a net over it and tied ropes around it before rowing the whale into the shore.

Although it is believed that whaling off Japanese waters began thousands of years ago, the Kayoi Whale Festival paid homage to the 12th century period when whalers began to use hand-thrown harpoons and nets.

The hunters are then seen dragging the supposed whale onto dry land before carrying a stuffed toy whale on a plank of wood above their heads - much to the joy of the onlookers who were cheering and clapping - as the unconvincing replica was taken to where the ceremony began.

The 'traditional whalers' then sat cross legged facing the toy whale and proceeded to sing and continuously raise their hands in the air while drums were banging during the ritual.

The thoroughly entertained crowd clapped enthusiastically as the peculiar performance came to an end.
