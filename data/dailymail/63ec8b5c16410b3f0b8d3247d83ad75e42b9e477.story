Pop stars like Katy Perry might sport Grillz, but in the future humans could have diamond-encrusted teeth to improve oral health

Hip-hop legends and popstars might be known for sporting Grillz jewellery over their teeth, but in the future humans could have diamond-encrusted teeth to improve oral health and fight disease.

Scientists have discovered that tiny spherical diamonds could be used to promote bone growth and improve the durability of dental implants.

The miniscule gems, which are invisible to the human eye, could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis, which is a potentially debilitating disease in which bones break down due to reduced blood flow.

Scientists from the UCLA and the NanoCarbon Research Institute in Japan discovered that nanodiamonds - by-products of conventional mining that are four to five nanometers in diameter - could be used as a delivery system for proteins in the mouth as an improved treatment for osteonecrosis.

The disease affects the jaw and can prevent people from eating and speaking.

Bone loss also occurs next to dental implants, which leads to them becoming loose and uncomfortable, while failure of implants leads to more painful and expensive procedures.

Dean Ho, professor of oral biology and medicine at the UCLA School of Dentistry, led the study published in the Journal of Dental Research.

Dr Ho explained that doctors performing bone repair operations, which are typically costly and time consuming, surgically inset a sponge to administer proteins that promote bone growth such asbone morphogenic protein.

His team discovered that using nanodiamonds to deliver these proteins could be more effective in administering the proteins as they quickly bind to the bone.

The unique surface of the diamonds allows the proteins to be delivered more slowly, which may allow the affected area to be treated for a longer period of time.

Furthermore, the nanodiamonds can be administered non-invasively, such as by an injection or even an oral rinse.

Laura Moore, a PhD student at Northwestern University, which was also involved in the study, said the scientists have conducted studies in cells and animals.

She said: 'Initial studies indicate that they are well tolerated, which further increases their potential in dental and bone repair applications.'

Dr Ho believes that nanodiamonds are versatile platforms.

He said: 'Because they are useful for delivering such a broad range of therapies, nanodiamonds have the potential to impact several other facets of oral, maxillofacial and orthopedic surgery, as well as regenerative medicine.'

His team previously showed that nanodiamonds are effective at treating multiple forms of cancer in pre-clinical models.

Osteonecrosis can be a side effect of chemotherapy, which is why the group of scientists decided to examine whether nanodiamonds might help treat the bone loss as well.

Results from the new study could pave the way for more research into how nanodiamonds could be used to address different challenges in drug delivery.

Dr No-Hee Park, dean of the School of Dentistry at UCLA, said: 'This discovery serves as a foundation for the future of nanotechnology in dentistry, orthopedics and other domains in medicine.'
