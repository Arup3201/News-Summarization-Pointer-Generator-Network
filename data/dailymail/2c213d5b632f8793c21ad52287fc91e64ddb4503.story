Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud's injury is worse than first feared with the Frenchman possibly facing a lay-off until the New Year.

Giroud, who picked up an ankle injury in the dying moments of Saturday's 2-2 draw at Everton, scored the equaliser Goodison Park, but could leave Arsenal short up front for the next four months.

The injury would rock Arsenal's title hopes just two games into the new season with Alexis Sanchez and Yaya Sanogo to call upon to fill the centre forward role.

Manager Arsene Wenger said in a press conference that Giroud would see a specialist on Wednesday, and despite not categorically ruling out the Frenchman for any length of time, Wenger admits he is sad about the news of an injury, which he claimed could be long-term.

Wenger ruled Giroud out of Wednesday's Champions League play-off second leg with Besiktas, saying: 'He will not play.'

'For the rest, he will see a specialist in England tomorrow (Wednesday) and after we will make an announcement of how long he will be out.

Lone man? Summer signing Alexis Sanchez is an option for Arsene Wenger up front

Option: Yaya Sanogo is a more natural forward, but their are still reservations over his ability

Transfer: Lukas Podolski seemed in high spirits despite speculation linking him with a move away

'We prepare for the game. It can be a long-term injury. We will see tomorrow (Wednesday). I don’t know if it’s broken. It’s sad for us but we are focused on the game.'

The injury may have an impact on Wenger's movement in the transfer market both coming in and out of the club. 

Lukas Podolski was thought to be heading to Juventus but a loan move is now in doubt, while Wenger may need to strengthen the frontline further.

Yaya Sanogo was in good form in pre-season, scoring four goals against Benfica in the Emirates Cup, but Wenger refuses to panic just yet and is still looking ahead to the Beskitas clash.

'We are 24 hours from a big game and our focus is more on that than the transfer window. I learn one thing in our job: you say nothing categorically.'
