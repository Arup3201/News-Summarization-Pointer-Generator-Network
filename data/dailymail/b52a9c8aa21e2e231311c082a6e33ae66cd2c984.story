What appeared to be a plan to steal metal from a utility pole backfired dramatically when it fell over and trapped the alleged thief.

The man was apparently trying to steal reinforced steel from a pole in Guang'an, in southwest China's Sichuan Province, next to the city's Vocational And Technical College.

However, as he attempted to saw through the concrete to get at the metal, the structure fell over onto his left arm and pinned him to the ground.

The alleged thief was unable to move after the pole fell on him in Guang'an, Sichuan Province

Pinned down: Circulation was cut off from the man's arm for so long that doctors may need to amputate it

A passer-by heard his cries for help and called emergency services.

Firefighters were able to lift the pole enough to pull the man free.

He was taken to hospital where doctors say he may have to have his arm amputated because it was stuck for too long without normal blood circulation.

Police are investigating the incident, which occurred on Wednesday, according to ECNS.com.
