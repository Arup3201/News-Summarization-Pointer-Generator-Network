Flights could soon be a much more technology-friendly place following a leaked report that suggests all devices connected to Wi-Fi can be used on most U.S. airliners.

The report claims that electronic devices can connect to Wi-Fi at all points in a flight, and not just above the current 10,000 feet threshold.

It goes much further than previous recommendations which sought to lower existing restrictions on electronic devices.

An FAA advisory committee has concluded passengers can safely use hand-held electronic devices during all portions of flights on nearly all U.S. airliners

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) advisory committee's report and recommendations haven't yet been released, but the contents were leaked to the Wall Street Journal.

The FAA committee said that ‘many aircraft flying today are largely ready to handle passengers using their electronic devices, including during take-offs and landings’, according to the newspaper.

However normal, ground-based cellular connections, such as those used for calls and data, will remain restricted. 

The suggestions are a hot-button issue for passengers, many of whom have chafed under strict rules that require portable electronic devices be turned off for take-off and landing

The committee concluded that 'gate to gate use' of such devices would also be safe

Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president of global public policy and member of the FAA committee, told the Journal that no matter what apps a device is running,  most aircraft ‘are going to be just fine’ in terms of safety.

He added that the committee believed ‘gate to gate use’ of such devices would also be safe.

The suggestions are a hot-button issue for passengers, many of whom have chafed under strict rules that require portable electronic devices be turned off for take-off and landing.

Some passengers fear their devices will imperil a flight by disrupting navigation or radio signals.

Others consider the risks remote and leave devices on during those critical phases of flight when planes are most prone to accidents.

The recommendations arose amid intense interest from the public and some members of Congress, prompting the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last year to set up a committee to recommend how the rules should change.

The committee began work in January aiming to conclude in six months. In July it got a two-month extension to come up with guidance on how airlines can assess the safety risks posed to critical flight systems and develop a policy on stowing devices that would work with expanded use of the devices.

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta ‘will review the report and determine next steps,’ an FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said this week.
