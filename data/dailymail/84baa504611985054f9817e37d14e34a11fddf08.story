'Viewed with red-green glasses, the active dust devils seem to float above the surface,' says the University of Arizona's Alfred McEwen

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured three dust devils thundering across the surface of the planet - and if you happen to have a pair of red-green 3D glasses handy, you can even see them in 3D.

'Viewed with red-green glasses, the active dust devils seem to float above the surface,' says the University of Arizona's Alfred McEwen,

'There are also some bright lines present in only the later image - those are the tracks of dust devils that passed through this region in the prior two weeks.'

Despite the atmosphere on Mars being 
desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – the planet's winds
 are strong enough to produce dramatic dust devils.

The dust devils whirl at huge speeds and can be bigger than any tornadoes on Earth.

The trio captured this week were tiddlers compared to some of the 'devils' seen this year - on March 14, 
the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter snapped a 12-mile-high monster.

The
 'devil' left a streak across the planet's surface - it's just 70 yards 
wide, but higher than Earth tornadoes, a column of dust whirling so fast
 it would sandblast anything in it.

'Because
 the density of Mars' atmosphere is so low, even a high velocity dust 
devil is unlikely to knock you over,' says the University of Arizona 
team which posted the video.

'However,
 you might be blasted by any sand or dust particles carried along by the
 dust devil, which might scratch the visor of your space suit quickly if
 you were caught outside by this monster.'

Despite the atmosphere on Mars being desperately thin ¿ one per cent of Earth¿s pressure ¿ the planet's winds are strong enough to produce dramatic dust devils, say Arizona researchers

The dust devil is the same size as a tornado on earth, but is a plume of dust whirling at a speed that would sandblast a spacesuit's visor

The length of the shadow indicates that the dust plume reached a height of 12 miles above the surface.

Dozens
 of smaller dust devils were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance 
orbiter's cameras, 'vacuuming' the surface around the monster 'devil'.

Despite
 its gargantuan height, the plume is only 70 yards in diameter, giving 
it a snake-like appearance that is twisted by high altitude winds, 
similar to another dust devil spotted recently in this region.

The dust devil is actually only 70 yards wide despite its huge height

Just
 as on Earth, winds on Mars are powered by solar heating. Exposure to 
the sun's rays declines during this season, yet even now, dust devils 
act relentlessly to clean the surface of freshly deposited dust, a 
little at a time.

Dust 
devils occur on Earth as well as on Mars. They are spinning columns of 
air, made visible by the dust they pull off the ground. Unlike a 
tornado, a dust devil typically forms on a clear day when the ground is 
heated by the sun, warming the air just above the ground.

As
 heated air near the surface rises quickly through a small pocket of 
cooler air above it, the air may begin to rotate, if conditions are just
 right.

The Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter has been examining Mars with six science 
instruments since 2006 and has has returned more data about Mars than 
all other orbital and surface missions combined.

One of its cameras is so powerful they can reveal objects on Mars as small as an office desk.

It has taken over 20,000 photographs of the Red Planet so far.

The
 Orbiter makes a complete circuit of Mars every 112 minutes, flying a 
nearly circular orbit that ranges in height from about 255 kilometres 
(160 miles) over the South Pole to 320 kilometres (200 miles) over the 
North Pole.

For handling 
large amounts of data, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has 160 gigabits of 
solid-state memory and a processor operating at up to 46 million 
instructions per second.
