A cyclist is claiming compensation from his local council after a collision with a pothole left him with a broken nose, fractured eye socket and in need of dozens of stitches.

Tony Webber, 25, says he can't face getting back on his bike after the accident on Tuesday, which ended with him lying in a pool of his own blood on Stoughton Road in Guilford, Surrey.

He was flipped over his handlebars and was knocked unconscious as he collided with the road. He hit his head with such force his teeth were forced through his lip. He was not wearing a helmet but claims doctors told him it would not have prevented his injuries.

Shocking injuries: Tony Webber is now claiming compensation from Surrey County Council after he fell from his bike when it hit a pothole

Luckily for Mr Webber, a GP was also cycling by and called the emergency services.

Mr Webber, a hospitality worker at the University of Surrey, said: 'I was cycling back from my friend's house and down a road which I go down everyday and that's the last thing I remember.

'The next thing I knew I woke in hospital several hours later and I was in a lot of pain. My mum took a picture of me and I couldn't believe the state of my face.

'Apparently I was lying on the road in a pool of blood. A passerby, who luckily happened to be a GP, found me and called the ambulance and police.'I cycle down that road every day Monday to Friday. The potholes are really big - they look like excavations.'

Mr Webber has sold his bike since the incident and says he won't be cycling for a long time.

He said: 'I've been cycling since I was four and have never had any accidents before now. But this incident has really put me off and I don't think I'll be getting on a bike any time soon.'

He said he is shocked by the treatment he has received from Surrey County Council when he reported the accident.

'I called up the council and they didn't seem bothered by it so I've contacted a claims company,' he said.

'A pothole has a very different impact on a bike and it completely took me out. It was pretty disgraceful.'

A spokesman for Surrey County Council said: 'We are unable to comment on this accident as we have not yet had a report from Surrey Police.

'However, in the seven previous years there were eight recorded injury accidents on Stoughton Road, most of which occurred at the mini-roundabout and none of which were attributed to potholes.

'We regularly inspect roads and repair potholes as quickly as possible according to the risk they present, and encourage the public to report them via our website or contact centre.

'Anyone can submit a claim for compensation, and we assess each one on its merits. As claims are paid from council funds we have a duty to our taxpayers only to pay out when we are clearly in breach of our responsibilities or our duty of care to our residents.'
