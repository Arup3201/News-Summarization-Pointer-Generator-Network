It was condemned as blasphemous upon its release, and caused outrage among Christians.

But three decades later, a leading churchman has declared that Monty Python film The Life Of Brian is in fact a ‘remarkable  tribute to the life of Jesus’.

The Rev Professor Richard Burridge, who sits on the General Synod of the Church of England, said Christians who opposed the satirical film were ‘embarrassingly’ ill-informed.

All change: Monty Python's 1979 film Life of Brian satirised the life of Christ and a senior clergyman has said the Church of England was wrong to try to get it banned because he believes it is an 'extraordinary tribute to Jesus'

The 1979 film follows a hapless 
fictional character called Brian, who is born at the same time as Jesus 
and is inadvertently  proclaimed to be the Messiah.

Jesus’s
 only appearance is during the Sermon on the Mount, when Brian is 
standing at the back of the crowd and struggling to hear his words.

Professor
 Burridge, Dean of King’s College London, said the film’s depiction of 
1st century Judea was probably more  accurate than in many Hollywood 
films about Jesus.

And he said the fact that the comedians had set out 
to write a satire about Jesus but had to resort to using a  fictional 
failed messiah instead was a tribute to the uniqueness of Christ.

Church backing: Reverend Professor Richard Burridge, pictured with the Pope, says Life of Brian 'is a wonderful satire on the way that Jesus¿s own teaching has been used to persecute others'

Classic: A scene from the 1979 Monty Python film, which starred Michael Palin, John Cleese, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and the late Graham Chapman. It was wildly popular but was also widely criticised

He
 said: ‘I think it is an extraordinary tribute to the life and work and 
teaching of Jesus – that they couldn’t actually blaspheme or make a joke
 out of it.

‘They were 
satirising closed minds, they were satirising fundamentalism and 
persecution of others and at the same time  saying the one person who 
rises above all this was Jesus … and I think that the Church missed 
that.’

Fresh start: The Pythons have reformed but member Michael Palin says if they tried to make the film today they would face an army of 'heavily armed' fanatics, making it impossible to do

Many Christians at 
the time, led by campaigner Mary Whitehouse, considered the film an 
outrage for supposedly poking fun at Christianity, and picketed cinemas 
to have it banned.

It was outlawed by 11 councils, and the ban in 
Torbay, Devon, was only lifted in 2008.

Professor Burridge made the comments on BBC Radio 4’s Today show, which was being guest-edited by Python Michael Palin.
