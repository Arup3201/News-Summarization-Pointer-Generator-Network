A disgraced politician accused of defrauding $200million of government funds used some of the money to buy cars, homes and luxuries for a prostitute with whom he had a son, it is claimed.

Mario Zelaya, 46, the former head of the national health service in Honduras, became infatuated with Natalia Ciuffardi, 28, after he met her at a strip club-cum-brothel in Chile.

He showered her with gifts and promised to help her leave the Platinum Club brothel in the capital Santiago de Chile, where she was working as a high-class prostitute charging £300 an hour.

The Chilean Geisha: Natalia Ciuffardi, 28, was the mistress of Honduran health chief Mario Zelaya, who is alleged to have used money from a $200million fraud to buy her homes and cars

Eventually Ciuffardi fell pregnant and Zelaya, already a married father-of-three, bought her homes and cars as well as sending her thousands of dollars a month to look after their son.

But she is now facing extradition to Honduras after she was implicated in the $200million fraud allegedly orchestrated by Zelaya over the four years he spent in charge of his country's public health system.

She maintains her innocence. 'He was very charming and I had no reason to suspect that the money he was giving me was not his own. How am I supposed to know that he had been stealing it?' she was quoted as saying by Central European News.

'I fell in love with him and when I became pregnant it was logical for me to leave and start a new life with the man who I thought I knew.'

Chile's courts are due to make a decision this week on whether to extradite Ciuffardi. According to her statements about to the court about her relationship with Zelaya, she first met him while working as a prostitute in 2011.

On that first night, she said, he had appeared at the Platinum Club in a group and spotted her when she sat down where he would be able to see her. He soon asked a waiter how he could be with her, she said, and she had sex with him after he agreed to pay about $230. 

They began an affair, with the wealthy politician treating Ciuffardi to beach holidays and beseeching her to give up her work as a prostitute. 

She said he would spend one week in every month with her, and that he had apparently been telling his wife, Michelle Alejandra Flores Borjas, 42, and their three children that he was in Chile on business.

Police said she continued working as a stripper and prostitute but stopped when she got pregnant, after which Zelaya maintained her with monthly payments of up to $5,000 a month.

His generosity did not stop there. As their relationship continued, Cuffiardi is said to have received gifts including two apartments, a house on the beach, two SUV cars, expensive perfumes, watches, clothes and purses.

Pro-business: Zelaya got his job at the head of the Honduran health service after a military coup ousted the country's left-wing president Manuel Zelaya - no relation - in 2009

But in early 2014 it all came to an end when a Honduran court ordered Zelaya arrested on charges of fraud, bribery, abuse of public funds and money laundering.

Zelaya fled, but not before warning his girlfriend he may never see her again. 'The first I knew that anything was wrong was when he called me and asked me to forgive him. He said I'll understand him one day,' she said.

'He asked me to always say good things about him to our son. And that he felt sorry for what happened, but we are never ever going to meet again.'

Last September Zelaya was finally captured in the southern state of El Paraiso, which borders Nicaragua. Prosecutors discovered more than $7 million worth of assets including mansions, apartments, land and vehicles under Zelaya's control. 

It was a dramatic fall from grace for Zelaya, who had been a respected doctor and also served for several years in the Honduran army. His rise to power began in 2009 when Honduras's left-wing former president Manuel Zelaya - who is of no relation - was ousted in a coup backed by the U.S.

The country's new president, Porfirio Lobo, appointed Zelaya to the top post on the IHSS. Dana Frank, a Honduras specialist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said that under Lobo crime and corruption mushroomed.

'They just threw the rule of law out the door,' she told the New Orleans Advocate, adding that since the coup the country's leaders have clamped down on civil liberties, including freedom of speech.

Soon after his appointment, Zelaya is alleged to have begun accepting $2million in bribes from a Honduran consulting company, said to be the beginning of a campaign of fraud and embezzlement which took in unjustified purchases, exorbitant contracts, airline tickets, travel and hotel stays.

Zelaya left the IHSS, which covers 1.6 million Hondurans, in precarious financial shape after allegedly overpaying companies, some formed by his former IHSS subordinates, according to Honduras's National Anti-Corruption Board.

Now Ciuffardi is part of the corruption probe as well. She said the fact that officials in Honduras had not even realised the money was stolen for so long meant that it was also impossible for her to know.

She said: 'He told me he would change my life. He promised he would help me leave my job and we would build a home together. I believed him and I fell in love with him.'
