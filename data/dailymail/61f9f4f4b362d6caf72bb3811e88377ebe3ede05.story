Peter Haynes, pictured outside London's High Court, claims he cannot be blamed for causing the six-car motorway pile-up because he was 'sleep driving' at the time

A risk management expert who says he was 'sleep-driving' when he caused a six-car motorway pile-up - seriously injuring a 'bright' student - says he cannot be blamed for the smash.

Oil and energy consultant, Peter Haynes, was described as 'steaming past' other motorists at 70mph in his Toyota Land Cruiser, before crashing into the back of a VW Polo.

The car was being driven by 'high-achieving' Norwich School A-level student, Simon Green, then aged 19, on a slip road off the A47 in Norwich, on March 1, 2012.

Mr Green, now 22, of Hillcrest North, Pickenham Road, Swaffham, suffered permanent brain damage after being trapped in the crash which has had a 'devastating impact' on his life. He is now suing Mr Haynes for massive damages at London's High Court.

But Mr Haynes, also an honorary lecturer in risk management at the University of East Anglia, is mounting a unique defence to the claim.

His lawyers say he cannot be held responsible for the crash because he passed out at the wheel following a sudden bout of sickness.

The businessman, in his 60s, of the Old Vicarage, Metfield, near Harleston, Norfolk, denies that he was too ill to drive and says his blackout was totally unexpected.

Stephen Worthington QC, for Mr Haynes, claims he was in a 'state of automatism' - similar to a sleepwalker - when he caused the crash.

But Mr Green's lawyers say that defence - even if accepted - should not prevent the student from winning damages as an 'innocent party'.

They dispute that Mr Haynes' actions immediately before the crash are capable of supporting the automatism defence.

They also insist he should not even have been on the road, as he was 'too ill to drive'.

Susan Rodway QC, for Mr Green, told Mr Justice Supperstone: 'It was a very tragic and unusual accident. It is remarkable Mr Green survived.

'He has suffered brain damage of a permanent nature. He was a very high achiever and that has caused a devastating impact on his young life.'

Mr Haynes had been attending a work conference on the offshore gas industry, held at the John Innes Centre, in Norwich when he was struck down with illness.

After half an hour at the event, suffering symptoms of sickness and diarrhoea, he decided he could not stay. Having obtained an emergency doctor's appointment, he set off on the 50-minute journey to his home.

Mr Haynes said he had been driving at between 55 and 60mph when his abdominal pain became more severe and he decided to find somewhere safe to pull over.

But within three seconds, he felt 'as if his head were deflating' and he blacked out, immediately before crashing into Mr Green's car.

However, Mr Green's lawyers dispute that speed after witnesses claimed they saw him overtaking drivers who were going 70mph, in the outside lane.

Motorist Matthew Sayer told the court he was able to estimate the speed of Mr Haynes' car as he 'came steaming past'.

Miss Rodway added: 'It is Mr Green's case, quite simply, that if Mr Haynes felt so unwell he could not remain at the conference - which he had presumably paid to attend - then he was probably not in a fit state to drive himself home.

'His judgment and ability would almost certainly have been impaired by reason of his distraction with his illness as well as his pain.

'Having chosen to take the risk of driving, it was incumbent on him to drive as slowly and safely as possible - driving at or over the speed limit and in the outside lane of the dual carriageway, does not constitute slow and safe driving.'

The High Court hearing continues.
