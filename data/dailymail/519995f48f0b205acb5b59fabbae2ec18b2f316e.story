It seems these two real estate agents saved their dirty tricks for the bedroom.

Coldwell Banker realtors Robert Lindsay and Jeannemarie Phelan have allegedly been caught on camera having sex numerous times in a New Jersey home which they were trying to sell about two years ago.

Now they're being sued by the owners, Denville's Richard and Sandra Weiner, who claim the agents deliberately steered away potential buyers so they could use the house for their 'sexual escapades'.

The Weiners also claim Lindsay, a former Passaic County Board of Realtors president, made a duplicate 
key and intentionally over-priced the home to discourage buyers from December 2011 to January 2012.

NorthJersey.com reports the couple is suing both Lindsay and Phelan for committing the 'ultimate breach of trust' and Coldwell for violating the realtor code of ethics.

According to the suit filed on December 6, the Weiners began working with Lindsay and Coldwell in early 2010 when Lindsay repeatedly told them the Wayne home would sell for $650,000.

The couple contracted him to list it in December 2011.

That's when the trouble allegedly began. 

On December 27, 2011, security cameras allegedly captured the agents hugging and kissing in the kitchen before undressing and having sex on the Weiners' bed.

The suit says footage shows the pair allegedly hooking up many more times until they were busted by cops on January 23, 2012.

'Sandra Weiner happened to be checking the video cameras feed at 
the time and saw strange people in the house with what she thought were 
flashlights,' the suit states.

'The house was dark at the time. The Weiners called the 
local police, who then went to the house.

'The police opened the
 door to the house and found Lindsay pulling up his pants. Lindsay lied to police by telling them that he was there to 
prepare the house for an open house.

'Instead, Lindsay and Phelan were 
at the house to have sex.'

After watching the footage, the Weiners claim 'they could no longer use the bedroom or the remainder of the house' and 'were uncomfortable and disgusted even being in their house, UPI reports.

The Weiners filed the suit in state Superior Court in Passaic County (pictured) on December 6

The suit accuses Coldwell of 
violating the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the National 
Association of Realtors, which requires that 'shall not deliberately mislead the 
owner as to the market value.'

Hal Maxwell, president of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in New Jersey, told NorthJersey.com  the company no longer works with Lindsay or Phelan.

'Immediately after learning of the allegation of improper behavior at the property by two independent contractors in January 2012, we ceased our affiliation with the agents,' he said.

'These agents have not listed or sold properties on our behalf since the allegation of misconduct at the home was first reported.'

The Weiners are seeking compensatory damages for invasion of privacy, infliction of emotional 
distress, breach of contract, trespass of land and other civil counts.
