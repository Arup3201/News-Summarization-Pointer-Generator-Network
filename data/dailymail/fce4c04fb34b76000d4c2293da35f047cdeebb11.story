For a parent, breaking the news to your only child that there's a baby on the way can be a nerve-racking - but touching - moment.

And for one family who decided to film the precious moment, it also became a hilarious home video clip. 

Mum Megan Williams revealed that her two-year-old daughter Kathryn is constantly asking for a little brother or sister.  

Breaking the news: Kathryn, two, sits on her dad's lap to be told she is going to be a big sister

So she decided to sit Kathryn in her father's lap, and film her reaction as they told her the news using a special book titled 'The Big Sister's Book of Waiting'.

'Do you know why we've got you this book?' her dad asks. 'Because you're going to be a big sister!'

For Kathryn it was all too much. 

As she digests the wonderful news, she struggles to keep the excitement in - in one sense at least.

Helping hand: Her parents showed her a book called 'The Big Sister's Book of Waiting'

Little surprise: But her reaction wasn't quite what her parents were expecting

She leans over to her father and whispers, 'I farted' - leaving her parents in stitches

The clip, uploaded to Someecards' YouTube page, has had almost 500,000 views since it was published on March 19.
