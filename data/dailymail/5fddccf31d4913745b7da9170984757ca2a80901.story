A Colorado man who plunged 100-feet whilst hiking with friends used skills that he'd learnt from gymnastics class to do a flip in mid air and save his own life.

Dylan Schuetz, 21, from Colorado, was hiking in The Glacier National Park in Montana, when he plunged in St Mary’s Glacier.

His dramatic fall could have ended his life if it weren’t for the flip that he’d practiced repeatedly at a gymnastics class which helped him to land on his feet.

Skill: Mr Schuetz, pictured here hanging from a rock, fell 100-feet whilst hiking in Montana and he ended up using skills that he had learnt at gymnastics class to do a flip in mid air

Glacier National Park: Soon after Mr Schuetz arrived at the park with friends, he plunged into St Mary's Glacier

The sporty gymnastics teacher stunned his friend Cody Tengler, who was nearby with the unexpected move.

Mr Tengler told ABC news: ‘He spots his landing and then kind of does a flip, a front flip over himself.’

However the gymnast’s move couldn't save him from quite a few broken bones.

Mr Schuetz broke both of his legs and ankles in the fall. He also punctured a lung.

He was in bad shape as his his frightened friends called 911 and tried to keep him conscious until help arrived.

‘We just kept talking to him, do everything that you can to keep him alive and going, and just have hope,’  Matthew Campbell, Schuetz’s said.

Gymnastics: Mr Schuetz, pictured here doing a flip, had practiced this move continually at his gymnastics class and it certainly came in handy

Rescue: His friends said that they kept talking to him to keep him alive before help arrived

Hospital: Mr Schuetz is recovering in Colorado Hospital, and will have another surgery on Friday

After his miraculous escape, Mr Schuetz is recovering in Colorado Hospital, and will have another surgery on Friday.

His mom, Stacey Dale-Schuetz said her son will never hike again after the shocking incident.

But he does have plans to return to the sport that saved his life.

She recalls: ‘The doctor said, ‘Do you want to do gymnastics again, Dylan?’ And he said, ‘Yeah!’ He said, ‘Well then, we’ll get you there.’

‘Anything he wants to do, I know he’ll accomplish,’ she added.
