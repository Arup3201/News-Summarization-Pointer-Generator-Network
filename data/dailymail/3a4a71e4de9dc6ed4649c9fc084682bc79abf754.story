It has been a busy two days for George Zimmerman as he sat down for his first on-screen interview since his arrest over the death of Trayvon Martin.

He revived his old website and posted a personal plea to supporters, thanking them for their continued prayers and financial help.

Each of those public moves have had a judicial impact as both his hour-long interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity and his bilingual YouTube video have been added to the collection of possible evidence to be used in his trial.

Direct appeal: George Zimmerman posted a nearly-2 minute, bilingual video thanking fans for their support

Different view: Zimmerman writes, in addition to hoping to collect money for his defense fund, his new website can be a way for his supporters can connect and get the true information

ABC News reports that the prosecution,
which charged the neighborhood watchman with the second degree murder 
of the unarmed teen, entered a tape of the interview into evidence 
Thursday morning.

One of the most controversial points 
of the interview was when the 28-year-old said that 'It was God's plan' 
when asked if he would do anything differently.

He went on to clarify his statement, 
saying: 'I do wish there was something, anything I would have done to 
put me in a position where I didn’t have to take his life.’

Prosecutors will likely use this to 
argue that the attack was premeditated and his lack of remorse shows 
that he may have had ulterior motives during the attack.

Legal analysts feel that Zimmerman has put himself in a trap in allowing for the interview to take place.

‘He has impeached himself publicly, 
this is going to be a huge problem for him... and the prosecutors must be 
extremely pleased... He was making inconsistent statements that they can 
use in a trial against him,’ said veteran legal consultant Mark Eiglarsh
to ABC News.

Opening up: This is the first time George Zimmerman has spoken publicly about the night he killed Trayvon Martin

Latest twist: Zimmerman tried to speak to Walters today while she was talking about him on The View but she refused again

Whether he likes it or not, Zimmerman
is also being tried in the court of public opinion and that case does 
not appear to be going very well either.

Legendary anchor Barbara Walters 
appeared on her show, The View, on Thursday morning telling of her own 
chaotic interaction with Zimmerman the night before.

Zimmerman told the ABC team yesterday 
he would only agree to talk to her after the exclusive with Sean Hannity
and only if she put him and his wife up in a hotel for a month.

Walters, already reportedly seething 
she didn't get the exclusive, was said to have been 'appalled' by the 
conditions and called him 'desperate for money'.

Speaking about the almost-interview on
The View, she explained that Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara agreed to 
let her do the interview but only after he sat down with Hannity, who 
'had been very supportive in the past and George Zimmerman told me that 
he was very grateful, and I appreciated his loyalty to Hannity', she 
said.

When she arrived in Florida yesterday 
morning for the planned interview, she told viewers when Zimmerman came
to the door in a T-shirt, it should have been her 'first clue' that he 
wasn't going to do it.

Though she would not disclose what the
'one condition' was that the 28-year-old demanded, she alluded to the 
fact it was payment of some sort by saying 'as a member of ABC News it 
was not something she was able to grant'.

ABC News does not pay for interviews.

She then went on to describe Zimmerman
as 'desperate for money' and 'very worried about his family', adding 
that he was 'polite, soft-spoken, stubborn' as his lawyer 'wanted him to
do the interview'.

As she was explaining the situation to
her co-hosts and the world live on TV, she heard through her earpiece 
that Zimmerman and his lawyer Mark O’Mara were on the phone asking to 
speak with her.

On air, she rejected the call, saying:
'Well this is an interesting day. But Mr Zimmerman, if you could not do
the interview yesterday, I don’t think we should do a quick one today. 
In the future if you feel differently, we will consider it.

'We will now continue with our program and the people who want to be interviewed.'

Zimmerman’s lawyer Mark O’Mara spoke 
to The Miami Herald, giving a glimpse in the seemingly-chaotic world of 
dealing with George.

‘The client always calls the shots,’ Mr O’Mara said.

‘If you’re on the streets or about to 
be hungry and worried for the wife you love, maybe you have to make 
decisions along the way.’

Speaking about the on-air phone call to Walters, Mr O’Mara defended his client.

‘He just wanted to thank her for being
gracious and to apologize. We weren’t expecting to do an interview live
on her show,’ he said.

‘It was a team decision, made on the 
fly, quite quickly. Someone said she was talking about it on the show, 
so we jumped up and turned on the TV. There wasn’t a lot of 
forethought.’

Fellow Florida defense attorney 
Michael Grieco says that the actions over the past few days give an 
insight into how the case is being handled behind the scenes, and it 
isn’t pretty.

‘O’Mara is not in control over the situation and has got to pull the reins in,’ Mr Grieco told The Herald.

‘Zimmerman is a loose cannon... he can’t see past his nose.’

Enter Zimmerman and his computer: on 
Thursday morning, Zimmerman relaunched his website and posted a note to 
supporters as well as a bilingual YouTube video saying that he wanted to
thank them but also expressing his financial need.

‘Given the extraordinary circumstances
surrounding this case, we have now realized that it is much larger than
we ever thought regarding its extent and cost,’ he wrote on the site.

‘We have been in hiding in temporary 
housing, and our security needs have been extremely high. The fund has 
been devastated by the need to pay $100,000 to a bondsman and almost 
$50,000 in security expenses.

‘The skyrocketing legal costs have 
gone unpaid. The defense fund is at its lowest point since its 
inception; in fact, with outstanding expenses yet unpaid, the fund is 
near depletion.’

Evidence: Zimmerman told Hannity that Trayvon broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement, which corroborate with the Sanford police department's photos from that night

The
couple have already come under fire after lying about their finances 
which - when disclosed - led to Zimmerman being arrested again and his 
bail being put up to $1million.

The interview came one day after it was
revealed that Zimmerman and his wife blew through $36,000 of cash he 
raised from his online legal defense fund on personal expenses like car 
payments, cell phones and paying off credit card debt -- even though he 
was in jail at the time.

Among
the expenses were $600 in jailhouse phone calls. Zimmerman, 28, spent 
three to five hours a day on the phone while he was in jail -- placing 
an average of 13 calls to friends and family each day, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

In
many of those calls Zimmerman used code to talk about money, especially
from the PayPal account. The biggest single chunk of money was a $5,000
payment for Zimmerman's first bail, which was set at $150,000.

However, the couple spent $7,000 to pay 
down credit card bills - $4,000 on their America Express bill alone.

O'Mara says the bills were for expenses that Zimmerman incurred when they
had to flee their home after they began receiving death threats.

Killed: Trayvon Martin was shot and killed the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida by George Zimmerman

Since being released, the interview with Hannity was the first time the 28-year-old has 
publicly spoken about the fateful night, explaining that it was no 
longer a choice for him to reach for the gun once he said Trayvon Martin
started bashing his head into the sidewalk and noticed his gun.

He said: ‘At that point, I realized 
that it wasn’t my gun, it wasn’t his gun, it was the gun. He said you’re
going to die tonight, [expletive]. I felt one of his hands going down 
my chest to my bolster. It just happened so quickly.’

Hannity later asked him if he 
regretted getting out of his car initially. Zimmerman said no, then 
saying he didn’t regret being armed, nor his other actions that night, 
adding: ‘I feel that it was all God’s plan. For me to second guess it, 
um...’

Throughout the interview, O’Mara sat beside his client, listening and at one point
taking a moment to say that with all the evidence presented, 
Zimmerman’s second-degree murder charge should be dropped to 
manslaughter.

He told Hannity that if given the chance, he would ‘tell them that, again, I’m sorry.’

He continued: ‘I’m sorry that they buried their child. I can’t imagine what it must feel like. And I pray for them daily.’
