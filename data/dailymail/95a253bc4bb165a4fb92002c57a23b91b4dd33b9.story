A mourner who visited the spot where his grandfather's ashes were scattered had to be winched to safety after getting stuck in mud up to his chest.

Grieving Daniel Traynor, 19, was visiting a coastal area where the family had spread the last remains of Jim Traynor.

But the clay mud gathered around his legs and he began sinking into the ground at Minster Cliffs in Sheerness, Kent.

Daniel was stuck and sinking for two hours before passers-by heard his desperate cries for help

Daniel - who had recently returned from from two weeks' survival training in the Amazon using the money from his grandfather's will - became stuck and could not wriggle free.

Eventually a 13-year-old boy and 21-year-old man heard his cries and tried to help - but then got stuck in the mud too.

They managed to use their mobile phone to dial 999 and coastguards and Kent Fire and Rescue Service raced to the scene.

Rescuers used a rope and shovels as they battled to clear mud from around Daniel and free him after his two hour ordeal on Sunday.

Daniel's mother Traci, 40, thanked the two passers-by, who were freed from the mud and taken to hospital for precautionary checks.

She said: 'They are amazing. They are my heroes. I want to give them both a bug hug.

'They stayed with him, they tried to help him, they put themselves at risk.

'When you hear so much bad press about kids, you've got a really got couple of kids there.'

Firefighter Paul Schembri, from Kent Fire and Rescue Service said: 'This is a real lesson to everyone to be extra careful when walking on any unstable surface, please stick to tracks and solid ground.

'It may look safe to walk on, but you can quickly become stuck and find yourself in a very dangerous position.

'I also want to appeal to anyone to call 999 if they see someone stuck and in need of help, rather than attempting a rescue themselves.

'I would like to praise all firefighters involved for their efforts in what was a very difficult environment.

'This was a multi-agency effort involving the RNLI, Coastguard, police and ambulance services.'
