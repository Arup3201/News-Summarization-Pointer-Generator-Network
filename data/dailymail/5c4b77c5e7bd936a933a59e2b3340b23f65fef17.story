Prisoners should be allowed to buy their way out of jail early, a Lib Dem councillor has said.

Roy Davies says non-violent offenders should be able to pay £10,000 to have their six-month sentence halved.

His proposal has won backing from colleagues in Blackburn, Lancashire. But political opponents have dismissed it as a 'crackpot' idea.

Former Justice Secretary Jack Straw, the local MP, blasted it as 'totally wrong'.

Cllr Roy Davies, left, says prisoners should be able to buy their way out of jail early. He has been supported by council leader David Foster, right

He said: 'It's the kind of thing we 
oppose in other countries. It is the job of the court system to decide 
the appropriate penalty and the court system should be blind to how deep
a person's pockets are, or it becomes completely unfair.

'There is also a question of where the criminals have got the money from in the first place.'

Cllr
Davies, member for the town's Darwen ward, claims it would help ease 
overcrowding in jail, and recoup money to make up for Government cuts, 
such as closing the front counter at his local police station.

However, Mike Cotton of the Campaign for Justice and Public Protection, said: 'I think it's a crackpot idea that wouldn't work.

'Most
of the people who go to jail do not have the finances to pay for that 
kind of thing, and as it is, courts struggle to get fines of even £25 
off people. It just doesn't work like that.'

Blackburn MP Jack Straw, the former Justice Secretary, has dismissed Roy Davies's proposal to have prisoners pay for early release

Cllr Phil Jones, leader of the For Darwen Party, says the idea would not work as people were likely to be paying the fines through criminally-obtained funds.

He said: 'The better criminal they were, the more money they'd have available to cut their sentence.

'Rather than getting the criminals to pay with cash, maybe we should get them to work to pay off their sentence.

'Recycling
costs the borough a heck of a lot of money, so why don't we dump all 
the rubbish in the prison yard and get the criminals to sort it out?'

Cllr Davies's letter to the Lib Dem members outlining his plan: 'The more I think about the meeting that was held at the Library Theatre on Tuesday night the more concerned I am about who should actually be expected to hold the burden of the proposed reduction in police funding, which would be as I see it being placed on the public which actually pay now for their services.

'I think in all honesty this burden should be placed at the law breakers and the criminals.

'How could this be achieved? When a non-violent criminal is sentenced, part should be a custodial sentence and part a fine (ring fenced to go to police funds).

'Provided the criminal behaves themselves when in prison they will serve the sentence given. If they do not behave themselves they will serve a longer sentence.

'If this is introduced it could well be a win-win situation: not as many criminals stopping in prison longer this will ease the overcrowding, and monies collected will offset the need for cut backs in policing and will be seen in the public eye as making the law breaker pay for the police services.

'I think that this should be put to our leaders in central government as a way of reducing cut backs.'

Cllr Davies made his suggestion in an email to Liberal Democrat members on the Blackburn with Darwen council.

He said: 'The law-abiding people in this country are having to take on the problems caused by cutbacks. Why should we have to do this?

'The criminals should be made to pay fines for early release.

'They get time off for good behaviour, so why not allow them the chance to put money back to cover the cuts?

'It would be win-win. There would be less money spent on keeping them in prison, and more money for the police service to keep us safe.

'The money would definitely have to be ring-fenced to be spent only on covering budget cuts though.'

Cllr Davies said his idea would only apply to non-violent crimes such as car theft, drug dealing, people trafficking and fraud.

He said the amount payable should be decided by government in a unified way depending on the crime, but suggested that a fine of £10,000 could halve a six-month sentence.

Cllr Davies added: 'A lot of criminals play the system, and some, like drug dealers have a lot of money hidden away that the court never get to know about.

'But if they couldn't come up with the money, then they serve a harder sentence, that's all.

'Some professional criminals who go from one sentence to another won't be bothered about getting off early, but others will.'

Blackburn with Darwen Liberal Democrat leader David Foster said he supported Cllr Davies's idea and would be sending it on to ministers.

He said: 'I think it's useful. We should always try and make criminals pay for their misdemeanours and this would be a way of them contributing back to the community. It could also be a way of them contributing to the police.

'Getting criminals to pay for what they have done is all to the good.'
