The police officer who fatally shot a Hofstra University junior as she was being held at gunpoint by an intruder last year has been cleared of any wrongdoing.

Officer Nikolas Budimlic ‘acted accordingly’ when he opened fire, killing not only the armed suspect but 21-year-old Andrea Rebello in May 2013, at an off-campus New York house, the Nassau County District Attorney's Office announced on Wednesday following an 11-month investigation.

Budimlic ‘reasonably perceived threats of deadly force against himself and others and acted accordingly,’ the report states.

The suspect, Delton Smith, 30, who was a wanted felon after breaking parole for an armed robbery, was shot seven times by the responding officer.

‘Though the results were unquestionably tragic, criminal charges under these circumstances would be inappropriate and legally unsustainable,’ Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said at the conclusion of a 28-page report into the May 2013 shooting.

The prosecutor concluded that the death of 21-year-old Andrea Rebello of Tarrytown, N.Y., was caused by gunman Dalton Smith's decisions to break into a Hempstead residence armed with a gun, taking several residents hostage and then refusing to surrender when police arrived.

Rice's report for the first time publicly identifies the police officer involved in the shooting as Nikolas Budimlic, an eight-year veteran of the Nassau Police Department who had previously spent 12 years as a New York City police officer.

Budimlic was among the first officers to respond to a report of an early morning robbery at a house near the Hofstra campus.

After
 entering the house, the officer soon encountered Smith holding Rebello 
in a headlock.

Smith maneuvered down a flight of stairs and was 
attempting to leave with the young woman through a rear door, hollering 
expletives at police officers and threatening to shoot the student.

‘Smith
 ignored numerous commands to drop his weapon and repeated his threats 
to shoot both Andrea Rebello and Officer Budimlic,’ the report states.

‘Officer
 Budimlic clearly and reasonably believed that the use of deadly 
physical force was necessary to defend himself and Andrea Rebello and, 
on this basis, made the decision to discharge his weapon.’

Rice's report noted that Smith, 30, had been on parole for his involvement in an armed robbery.

An arrest warrant had been issued for him about three weeks before the fatal shooting occurred.

Smith also had prior convictions for attempted robbery and weapons possession.

It
 was not clear whether the weapon he was carrying the night of the 
Hofstra robbery was operable, the report found. Investigators suggested 
it may have been damaged after Smith was shot and fell on the weapon.

James
 Carver, president of the officer's police union, said he was not 
surprised by the prosecutor's conclusions.

He said Budimlic has been 
working in an administrative capacity during the district attorney's 
investigation.

‘It's 
what I expected,’ Carver said. ‘Officer Budimlic was in a situation 
where hostages' lives were at stake. He took appropriate actions. What 
everybody needs to remember is this tragic incident would not have 
happened if not for the actions of the perpetrator.’

A spokesman for the police department declined to comment, citing pending litigation.
