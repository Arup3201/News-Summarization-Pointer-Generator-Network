Cressida Bonas supported boyfriend Prince Harry as he made a speech at a charity event in London today.

The 24-year-old joined Harry's cousin Princess Beatrice at the We Day event, which promotes global youth empowerment.

Dance graduate Cressida, well known for her Bohemian style, chose to dress down for the event, launched by Free the Children, Virgin Atlantic and Barclays.

The blonde, who has been dating the Prince for almost two years, embraced the grungy look with charcoal Koral jeans, a leather jacket and kooky silver Converse trainers.

She happily posed for photos with her step-sister, Isabella Calthorpe, and her husband Sam Branson, son of the Virgin mogul.

Cressida has long championed the 'casual cool' look and always opts for jeans and a hoody over a feminine floral dress.

She has a far more laid-back attitude to fashion than the Duchess of Cambridge and loves plaid shirts, scruffy jeans and beanies - which she has been known to wear on dates with Harry.

Cressida, who loves wearing her long blonde hair in a tousled Bohemian style, has even been known to favour a velvet scrunchie - an accessory she left at home today.

Beatrice, on the other hand, looked 
every inch the Princess in a stylish grey coat, black skirt, blue shirt 
and her favourite £49 Carvela slippers.

Beatrice, 25, was joined by long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, who looked dapper in jeans and a black jacket.

The event, hosted by Laura Whitmore 
and Lilah Parsons at Wembley Arena, will see the likes of Jennifer 
Hudson, Dizzee Rascal, Ellie Goulding, education activist Malala 
Yousafzai and former US Vice President Al Gore take to the stage in 
front of 12,000 students, teachers and supporters from over 400 schools.

Prince
 Harry's own charities, Sentebale and The Royal Foundation of The Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, are both involved with 
helping children and young people to build their skills and confidence.

Prince Harry and Cressida have been spending a lot of time together in recent weeks.

They dined at the Ivy earlier this week. Sam 
Branson, the son of Virgin tycoon Richard and Cressida's brother-in-law, joined
 them for dinner at the upmarket Covent Garden restaurant.

But
 it was glum faces all round as the trio made their way out of the 
restaurant, with Prince Harry appearing put out by the presence of the 
photographers outside.

Cressida is now 
thought to be living at Kensington Palace with Harry and on Valentine's 
Day, was spotted picking up an M&S meal for two for the pair to 
enjoy.

And it's not the first time that she - and her royal beau - have opted to keep things low key.

Other
 recent dates have included trips to high street burger chain Byron and 
to see the Cirque du Soleil production of Quidam at the Royal Albert 
Hall.
