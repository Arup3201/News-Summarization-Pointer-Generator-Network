He cut a small figure amid a sea of red poppies, each planted to represent British and Colonial soldiers who died on the battlefields of the First World War- some barely older than him.

Clad in camouflage, cadet Harry Hayes, 13, placed the last of 888,246 ceramic flowers at the Tower of London today. 

Making his presence at the moving Armistice Dall the more poignant, the schoolboy is the latest in a long line of men in his family to have joined the forces.

Harry's maternal great-great-great uncle, Private Patrick Kelly of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards, was killed in action on September 27 1918, just weeks before the war ended.

He was watched by thousands at the landmark display as he completed the vibrant red swathe of Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red.

13-year-old cadet Harry Hayes planted the final ceramic poppy at the Tower of London this morning to mark Armistice Day

The young cadet wore his full military attire including a poppy-embellished beret while undertaking the honour of planting the poppy

This year, Harry joined the Army Cadets after becoming eligible when he turned 13, becoming the latest in a long line of men in his family to have served. He is the youngest member of the force.

Cadet Hayes said he was nervous as he went up to plant the poppy, telling Sky News: 'It is an amazing honour, seeing all these poppies and I managed to plant the last one.'

His great-great-great uncle Private Patrick Kelly of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards, was killed in action on September 27 1918, just weeks before the war's end.

The soldier, from Westport, County Mayo, is buried in Sanders Keep military cemetery in Graincourt-les-Havrincourt, France. 

He enlisted into the British Army in Atherton, Lancashire. When he died, he left behind a wife, Marjory née Nixon.

Harry's father Des Hayes is  a major in the Combined Cadet Force, having been a Captain in the Army Cadet Force. A veteran of the British Army, he served with the Airborne Forces from 1978 to 1989.

He now works as the Operations and Safety Manager for the Historic Royal Palaces, specialising in fire, health and safety during events at the Tower of London.

As part of his role at the Tower, Mr Hayes wrote the safety rules for cadets volunteering to plant the poppies, including a risk assessment of his son's special public planting appearance today.

Mr Hayes has previously worked as a fire safety officer across various stations for the London Fire Brigade

Reading Blue Coat School tutor Will Mitchell said Harry was a positive and happy student who had joined the school just this year:

'He's settled in remarkably well. He is quite conscientious boy who's very positive and always smiling,' he said.
