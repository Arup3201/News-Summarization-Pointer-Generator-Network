A best-selling author has urged the Government to substitute plays by William Shakespeare for more modern works on the curriculum, arguing teenagers cannot relate to the Bard.

GP Taylor, whose work includes Shadowmancer, described Shakespeare as 'dry' and claims more up-to-date books would ensure younger generations become enchanted with reading.

Figures show that children growing up in his home county of Yorkshire are less likely to master the basics in reading and writing than those anywhere else in the country.

Mr Taylor claimed a key problem is the choice of books pupils are asked to study, adding: 'I do think Shakespeare is a real killer.

Best-selling author GP Taylor has called for the Government to replace Shakespeare on the curriculum with more modern books that teenagers will be more able to relate to

Mr Taylor, whose works include Shadowmancer, said teenagers cannot relate to the Bard's work, which can be 'dry', he said. He also claims youngsters would be more likely to become enchanted with reading if they were studying books they could relate to

'Young people tell me that it is a real pain for them and I think it puts them off.

'Not just Shakespeare, but it puts them off books in general. The language and the context is just not relevant to them and often they study it without the performance, so it’s just dry.

'Nobody will want to criticise Shakespeare because he is the nation’s Bard but when I visit schools young people tell me that reading Shakespeare is a pain.

'The key is to get them to read about things which are relevant to their lives.'

He has called for the works of more modern authors such as Sue Townsend, who wrote the series of Adrian Mole books and died last month, to be taught in lessons.

The author, from Scarborough in North Yorkshire says the Government should fund schools to bring more writers into the classroom to inspire a love of storytelling among young people.

Adrian Mole was written by author Sue Townsend, who died in April after a short illness

He says that having authors and storytellers meeting children helps to get young people interested in reading.

'Authors are storytellers,' he added. 'They know how to get people interested in the story and I find that even when we are saying the same things as the teachers pupils will be more open to us as we are not their teacher.

'The problem is, of course, that authors cannot give up all of their time free of charge and so this costs money. I think it is something the Government should look at.

'Funding schools to ensure every pupil has the chance to meet authors and work with them. It makes a huge difference. I see it myself and in other authors I speak to do as well.'

He has also urged schools and the Government to look to bring more modern writing into the school curriculum.

GP Taylor's first novel Shadowmancer was self-published by the author in 2003

GP Taylor is a New York Times best-selling author.

His works include Shadowmancer, Wormwood, Tersias, The Curse of Salamander STreet and The Tizzle Sisters.

Before becoming a full-time writer Mr Taylor was a police officer, motorcyclist and former rock band roadie turned Anglican vicar in the village of Cloughton, North Yorkshire.

He grew up in Yorkshire but moved to London in the 1970s where he worked in the music industry with bands including Sex Pistols, Elvis Costello and Adam and the Ants.

He became involved in the occult, living a life that was, in his own words, 'into all sorts of weird and wonderful things'.

Later he turned to Christianity, taking up a position as a vicar with the Church of England.

His first book, Shadowmancer, was self-published in 2003 and led to his getting a publishing deal with Faber and Faber in the UK and G.P. Putnam's Sons in the U.S. for a further six novels.

His work has been translated into 48 languages across the world.

His second novel Wormwood, was nominated for the U.S. book award, The Quills.

Tersias, his third book, was published in the UK in 2005. And in August 2006 came his follow up to Shadowmancer, entitled The Curse of Salamander Street.

In October 2006 Mr Taylor saw the release of The Tizzle Sisters and Erik, a mixture of prose and graphics. He was helped on the book by collaborators Tony Lee, Dan Boultwood and Harry Potter artist Cliff Wright.

He announced his retirement in October 2009, in order to care for his daughter, who suffers from Crohn's disease.
