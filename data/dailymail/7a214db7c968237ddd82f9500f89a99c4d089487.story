A mother-of-three battling breast cancer got the surprise of her life on Friday night as she was honored mid-concert by country music star Garth Brooks.

Teresa Shaw, 49, was among thousands of concert-goers at the Target Center in Minneapolis when her DIY sign reading 'Chemo this morning. Garth tonight. Enjoy the dance'  got noticed by Brooks.

The 52-year-old singer-songwriter who lost his mother and sister to cancer, walked over to Shaw and gave her a warm hug before exclaiming: 'You have all my strength, you have everybody's strength in here, and you go kick cancer's ass!'

She told KARE News that now, if she ever has a bad day, she can look at Brooks' guitar for some much-needed 'inspiration.'

'This is so cool. I will cherish it forever. [It] is a boost I really needed,' she added.

Shaw was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in June after a self-exam prompted a doctor's visit. 

They discovered a tumor more than two inches wide, which apparently did not show up on a mammogram.

Shaw underwent her 13th round of chemotherapy treatment last week before traveling from her home in Iowa with her 19-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, for Brooks' comeback concert.

She said when the performer started singing her favorite song, The Dance, she asked an usher if she could get closer to the front.

Comeback: Brooks returned this year with a new album after putting his career on hold for more than a decade to concentrate on family

She was shocked to suddenly find herself standing front row with her music idol giving her a personal serenade.

Brooks returned this year with a new album after putting his career on hold for more than a decade to concentrate on family.

He will remain in Minneapolis on the third-leg of his U.S. tour until November 15.

He will then move to North Carolina, Missouri and Arizona before finishing up in his home state Oklahoma in January.
