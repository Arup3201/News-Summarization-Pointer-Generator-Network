A shocking video has emerged which appears to show a pro-Russian rebel commander force-feeding captured Ukrainian soldiers their own uniforms.

It shows four frightened men in military fatigues kneeling while another man known simply as 'Givi' stands over them.

The aggressor who is thought to be a separatist fighter from the 'Somalia' group pulls out a large, shining knife and cuts the badges from their uniforms.

He then aggressively thrusts it down their throats and demands they begin chewing. The terrified men comply immediately.

Agressor: The alleged pro-Russian rebel cuts the badges off the men's uniform with a large knife

Threatening: He then forces the men to open their mouths and demands they chew the insignia

Terrified: The four men, believed to be captured Ukrainian fighters, are seen kneeling in terror

Intimidation: The alleged pro-Russian commander asks them: 'Why have you come here? Who called you to kill our people and destroy our homes?'

The alleged rebel fighter says: 'Why have you come here? Who called you to kill our people and destroy our homes?

'Do you know me? I'm Givi! I grew up here, this is my land, but I will come to you, so that you too know what this is, that this is hell.'

The video suggests the Ukrainian soldiers had been captured in Donetsk International Airport.

Separatists claimed today they had pushed government troops out of two districts outside their main stronghold of Donetsk. 

The pro-Russian rebels' advance, launched last week, has reignited fierce fighting which has already claimed the lives of over 5,000 people in Ukraine.

Separatists are now intent on pushing Ukrainian artillery back until it is out of range of their cities, in a bid to strengthen their bases.

Eduard Basurin, the rebels' deputy commander in Donetsk, said fighters had pushed government troops out of the suburb of Maryinka and the town of Pesky near Donetsk's airport.

He said: 'They had fully controlled Maryinka before. Now it is neutral. They are only on the outskirts.'

Destruction: Workers try to repair the city of Mariupol where rebel shelling killed at least 30 people

Death: The 30 people buried in Mariupol (pictured) are among the 5,100 killed in the Ukrainian conflict

Retaliation: The recent shelling has forced Ukrainian troops (pictured) to position themselves in Mariupol

Their ultimate goal is to eventually capture the entire Donetsk region, Basurin said. 

Meanwhile, shelling has continued all along the front-line which weaves through Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk provinces.

Vladimir Saakyan, a 60-year-old pensioner who fled his home in northern Donetsk, said: 'They've been shooting heavily for ten days. You sit there and have no idea who is in control of the town, who is shooting and when it will end.'

The United Sates and Europe have called for tighter sanctions against Moscow in light of the new rebel advance.

Ukraine's politicians and NATO claim Moscow has sent thousands of troops to fight on behalf of the rebels.

Now, US President Barack Obama has said Washington will consider all steps 'short of military action' to isolate Russia.

Unicef claims over 1,000 children have been forced to seek refuge in underground bomb shelters in Donetsk due to ongoing violence in eastern Ukraine.

It says thousands of people in embattled areas have little access to food, water or proper hygeine.

Giovanna Barberis, Unicef's Representative in Ukraine, said: 'Children in the affected areas have been suffering enormous levels of stress due to the ongoing conflict.

'The most vulnerable are those who have been forced to seek refuge in unsanitary, crowded and freezing cellars and bomb shelters, children living on the streets, and those who come from poor families or whose homes have been severely damaged.'

While the size and conditions of shelters vary, 1,000 children are estimated to be regularly seeking refuge inside them during heavy shelling in Donetsk city alone. 

Since March 2014, more than 1.5 million people have been displaced from the conflict-affected areas, including 1 million people within Ukraine. Of these, more than 130,000 are children.
