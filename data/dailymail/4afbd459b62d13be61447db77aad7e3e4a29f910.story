Stopping parliament proceedings for an entire day has been labelled a 'waste of time' by Senator David Leyonhjelm.

'I hope Bob Hawke doesn't die soon, otherwise we'll never get any work done,' the Liberal Democrat told reporters in Canberra on Monday.

Mr Fraser, Australia's 22nd prime minister, died on Friday aged 84.

Asked by Daily Mail Australia if parliament had gone too far in suspending business for an entire day, Senator Leyonhjelm said: 'Yes we are. The parliamentary agenda is very full. I see no reason why we should lose an entire sitting day.'

'Would it show any less respect if we resumed normal business after condolence speeches? I don’t believe so,' he added.

'I have almost nothing positive to say about him. He began his career as a right winger and finished it as a left-winger. He prevented his Treasurer from implementing much needed reforms,' Senator Leyonhjelm said of the late Malcolm Fraser

'A waste of time'. Senator David Leyonhjelm is unimpressed by the decision to suspend parliamentary business for a full day in order to pay tribute to former PM Malcolm Fraser

Malcolm Fraser was Australia's 22nd prime minister, he died on Friday aged 84. A state funeral will be held for him in Melbourne on Friday

Prime Minister Tony Abbott led tributes to Mr Fraser before parliamentary business is suspended for the day.

Senator Leyonhjelm said he had no fond words to say about Mr Fraser, other than he defeated Gough Whitlam in 1975.

'My mum said if you can't say anything good about someone don't say anything at all. So I'll be totally silent today,' he added.

'I have almost nothing positive to say about him. He began his career as a right winger and finished it as a left-winger. He prevented his Treasurer from implementing much needed reforms. His opposition to apartheid was sincere, but he was by no means alone in that,' Senator Leyonhjelm added.

The Senator's office confirming to Daily Mail Australia, that he wasn't impressed that a full day of work would because of condolence motions and they needed to be focusing on 'important legislation'.

'This is the last week before a six week recess. Inevitably the government will seek to curtail debate and restrict the ability of the Senate to review legislation. This is not good for democracy.'

'I wouldn’t wish to limit the right of any MP to have a say. However, many won’t say anything and it won’t require a day for it,' he said.

Meantime, Liberal Senator Chris Back said it was tragic that Mr Fraser and Mr Whitlam had died within five months of each other.

'They were both mountains of men,' he said.

Independent senator Jacqui Lambie spoke at length with Mr Fraser in December about refugees before voting against a government bill for temporary protection visas and fast-track processing.

Tony Abbott has led a full day of tributes in Australia's parliament for the late Malcolm Fraser, who died on Friday - the day-long condolences has been criticised by a Liberal Democrat Senator as 'a waste of time'

'To me, the amount of knowledge that he had, that will be greatly missed, especially when it comes to immigration,' she said.

Prime Minister Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten have begun the tributes this morning in the House of Representatives.

Liberal Zed Seselja said he hadn't always agreed with Mr Fraser, especially in his later years, but there was no taking away his significant contribution to Australia.

Asked how Mr Fraser would be remembered in the Liberal Party, the senator told reporters: 'Obviously there will be mixed reviews. Because in his later years Malcolm took a very different view from the Liberal Party on many issues.'
