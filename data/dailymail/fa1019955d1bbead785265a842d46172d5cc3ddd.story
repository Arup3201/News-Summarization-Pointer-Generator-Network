It's a story that rocked Australia to the core, and soon it may move international audiences too.

The tragic story of 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe who was abducted at a bus stop on the Sunshine Coast in 2003 is set to be made into a feature film aimed at an international release. 

The film, titled 'Where is Daniel?' was announced by Daniel's parents, Bruce and Denise Morcombe at their charity fundraiser in Brisbane on Saturday night.

The Morcombe's struck a deal with Australian producer Rod Hopping and his production company Heritage Films and the film is aimed to be released in 2016.

Whilst the script and casting are still being developed, the hope for the film is that it reaches international acclaim.

A teaser trailed has been released through the 'Where is Daniel?' website and illustrates eerie imagery of the Sunshine Coast with Daniel's emotional disappearance and pleas for his family to find him, narrated by a young boy.

'13 years of age and I was abducted on the 7th of December, 2003 not far from my home,' it narrates.

'I love horses, and motorbikes and my mum... I'm not sure why this happened to me, maybe I was just unlucky.'

The Morcombe's wrote a book in 2014 with the same title outlining their 8 year long search for their son

The film will be produced by Rod Hopping and Heritage films and Australian director, Peter Cousens

Denise and Bruce Morcombe announced this venture at their annual charity Gala dinner 'Dance For Daniel,' which has the Prime Minister and the Queensland Premier in attendance.

The parent's of the murdered schoolboy admit it was a difficult decision but believe they have found a production company and directer that they trust to tell their story the right way, the Sunshine Coast Daily have reported. 

'Denise and I feel we have reached a place where we can finally reveal our story in a different way,' Mr Morcombe said.

'We believe in their hands the world will discover our story and the legacy of Daniel from the unique perspective of a feature film. 

Eerie footage on the trailer shows a long dark road, perhaps imitating where Daniel was taken

Daniel's disappearance was one of the most extensively investigated cases in Queensland's history

Australian director Peter Cousens and producer Rod Hopping believe that a story of this magnitude will attract Australia's finest international actors.

The film is aiming for a budget of between $5 - $10 million with government industry funding as well as private equity.

13-year-old Daniel Morcombe was abducted at a bus stop on the Sunshine Coast in 2003.

After an eight year search, Brett Peter Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse, after abusing and killing Daniel in an abandoned house. 

It was one of the most extensively investigated disappearances in Queensland's history. 

The Morcombe's wrote a book in 2014 under the same title as the film, outlining their almost decade-long search for their son and even physically digging for his remains.

The film is expected to include all of these tragic details.
