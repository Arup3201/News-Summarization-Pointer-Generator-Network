Detectives are back in Portugal to review the case in the search for Maddie (pictured)

Scotland Yard detectives reviewing the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have travelled to Portugal for the first time to have 'formal' meetings with authorities there.

While officers from Leicestershire had regular contact with police chiefs in the south European country during their search for the youngster it is only now that senior officers from the Met have headed to the Iberian peninsula.

Madeleine was nearly four when she went missing from her family's holiday flat in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3, 2007 as her parents dined with friends nearby.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'MPS officers travelled to Portugal at the beginning of August and had their first formal meeting with Portuguese authorities to discuss ways to progress the investigative review.'

Portuguese detectives' investigation - helped by officers from Leicestershire Police - into her disappearance prompted appeals for help across the world.

But the official inquiry was formally shelved in July 2008 and since then no police force has been actively looking for the missing child, who would now be eight.

Her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann were said to be 'extremely pleased' that UK police met with forces in Portugal and hope there will be positive developments.

Spokesman for the family Clarence Mitchell said: 'Kate and Gerry are extremely pleased that the review is progressing. It is a positive step in the right direction.'

The meeting happened in secret a month ago, according to The Daily Express, but news of the meeting has only just emerged.

Ahead of the developments in Portugal, the McCanns met with police several times.

A source said: 'They are relieved. Things are finally being done and Kate and Gerry are being kept informed of every move.'

The
Met launched a review of the original investigation in May after a 
request from Home Secretary Theresa May supported by
David Cameron.

Hundreds of 
possible sightings of the little girl have been reported around the 
world since she went missing, but so far they have all come to nothing.

In her most recent interview, Mrs McCann said she believes the kidnapper who took Madeleine may also have drugged her other two children.

She said when she first realised Madeleine was missing she had to check that twins Sean and Amelie were still breathing because they did not wake as the frantic search for the missing three-year-old began.

She also believes the whoever took her daughter may have gone to the holiday flat the night before but fled after being disturbed.

In May this year, the Prime Minister asked Scotland Yard to carry out a review of the investigation to bring a 'new perspective' to the case.

But the move prompted questions about why the review could not have been carried out earlier, when evidence was fresher.

And critics will question whether there is any realistic prospect of a breakthrough in the case, which has seen no major developments since Madeleineâ€™s disappearance.
