A Second World War bunker with no windows and 4ft thick walls has been transformed into a pair of surprisingly light and airy £440,000 luxury homes.

The bunker, on a former RAF base at Caversfield, near Bicester, Oxfordshire, was originally built to withstand a bombing, gas or chemical attack and came complete with decontamination showers, air lock doors and a war room.

However, the huge building, which once had bare walls and a muddy floor, has now been split in half and transformed into two distinctive 1,400 sq ft two bedroom homes which are on the market for £440,000 each.

Simon Vernon-Harcourt, design and 
planning director of developers City & Country, said: 'It was probably one of 
the most challenging buildings we have ever tackled and was particularly
 unusual, because it didn’t have any windows.

'There were very few of these built around the UK and most have been demolished or turned into something else.

'As a bunker, you imagine it would be quite gloomy but it’s light and airy now.'
