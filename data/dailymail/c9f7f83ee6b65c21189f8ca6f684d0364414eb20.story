A U.S. tourist detained in Aruba 
after the suspected death of his travel companion is facing fresh questioning after a witness told police that the couple did not go into the sea.

Gary
Giordano, 50, claimed that Robyn Gardner disappeared two weeks ago 
as they snorkelled off an isolated beach.

But a man who was fishing at the spot at the time the Maryland woman is claimed to have vanished said that the pair left the beach without going into the water.

Facing questions: Gary Giordano arrives at a police station in handcuffs and without a hair piece as a witness disputes his account of how Robyn Gardner disappeared

Missing: A witness told police that Robyn Gardner, who was claimed to have disappeared while snorkelling off Aruba, did not even go in to the water

The witness told police that he saw the tourists walking on the beach at 4pm, but that they drove away without swimming in the ocean, reported ABC News.

He said that after they left, he never saw the couple again.

The witness statement is yet another piece of evidence that points to inconsistencies in Giordano's account of events.

The new evidence came as another woman said that Giordano had told her that he could make her 'disappear' without a trace after she rejected his proposal to take her teen model daughter to Aruba.

Giordano allegedly telephoned Carrie Emerson claiming to be a producer in late July after seeing pictures of her daughter on the Internet and told her that he wanted to take her 18-year-old daughter to the island for a swimwear photo shoot.

'He made the offer sound so wonderful that
anyone needing the money or the modeling job would have gone,' she told Fox News.

Shackled: Giordano was not wearing one of his toupees. Police had said they had struggled to trace the suspect's movements on the island because he kept changing hair pieces

Insurance: Gary Giordano tried to redeem accidental death policy on missing woman Robyn Gardner, which named him as a beneficiary, days before their trip to the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba

'Thankfully it was me who answered the phone and not my daughter.

'During the conversation, he told me that he could make me disappear and no one would ever look for me.'

Also speaking on Fox News, the Aruba 
Solicitor General Taco Stein last night denied reports that a blood 
handprint had been found on a rock near where Giordano was last seen 
with Ms Gardner.

'The detail about the hand print and blood is not true,' he said.

'That is not something that we have found,' adding, 'Let me put that to rest as that only hinders the investigation.'

Meanwhile, graphic, disturbing and 
'beyond pornographic' images are believed to have been found on 
Giordano's camera of Ms Gardner, calling into question the relationship 
between the pair, who were at first believed to simply be travelling 
companions.

Inconsistencies? Gary Giordano, left, speaks with detectives at Baby Beach on the day after Robyn Gardner disappeared

Being held: A judge on Monday granted a request from Aruban prosecutors to extend the detention of Giordano for 16 days

Giordano's camera, as well as his laptop and cell phone, have been sent away for analysis.

Solicitor general of Aruba Taco 
Stein - who called the 50-year-old a 'mean b******' - could not confirm 
the nature of the images to the Today Show but would only say it did not
look like she was under any duress.

Meanwhile
it emerged that the Maryland businessman tried to collect the 
$1.5million accidental death policy he took out on her just two days 
after he reported her disappearance to police.

Giordano,
who purchased the accidental policy shortly before travelling to the 
Dutch Caribbean island with the 35-year-old, tried to begin redeeming 
the American Express policy, which he took out just days before their 
trip and unusually only covered the trip to Aruba.

According to a police source, Giordano 
purchased a more expensive one-year policy instead of a more commonly 
purchased five year policy.

Giordano - a twice divorced father-of-three -Â  is still fighting the accusations and is being held in an Aruban prison.

Trouble in paradise: Robyn Gardner was seen at this restaurant on the afternoon that she vanished

The scene: The Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino in Oranjestad, where Ms Gardner and Mr Giordano were reportedly staying during the holiday

He still denies anything to do with Robyn's disappearance and claims she vanished while they were out snorkelling.

Police
are looking at a rock which is said to have a full hand print and blood
on it that was found behind a restaurant that the pair were said to 
have dined in before her disappearance.

On
Monday Giordano was ordered to remain in an Aruban jail for another 16 
days while police investigate 'serious inconsistencies' in his account 
of events.

The American Express accidental policy is currently being investigated by the FBI.

Court
documents show the 50-year-old has a history of domestic violence, has 
not been charged but remains the only suspect in the case.

His attorney has said he had nothing to do with her disappearance and has called for his release from jail.

Officers
having been tracing the movements of Giordano in the hours before Ms 
Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him 
in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees.

Video shows the pair at the Rum Beef Bar & Grill in the Baby Beach area of the island where Ms Gardner went missing.

Restaurant staff have told investigators that the woman seemed woozy while they ate.

Surveillance footage also shows Giordano in his rental car at the back of the restaurant, but the car had tinted windows so no one else in the vehicle can be seen.

Police said that they found blood on a rock behind the dive shop at the restaurant.
