A couple from rural Washington are on trial after being accused of starving their adopted children and forcing them to live off goat and dog food.

Jeffrey and Rebecca Trebilcock, both 45, face charges of criminal mistreatment and assault involving their five adopted children at their home in Longview.

The couple were first arrested after Rebecca brought her then 13-year-old boy to the doctors.

He was found to be suffering from broken ribs, severe malnutrition and weighed just 49 pounds.

The boy, who was just 4ft 4in at the time but is now a healthier weight after being taken into care, testified against the Trebilcocks yesterday and spoke of the abuse he suffered at their hands.

He told the court how he ate the food intended for animals because he 'didn't get to eat anything else and I was hungry.'

Fox News reported that the boy, who is now 14, also testified that the couple had installed alarms to prevent him and his siblings from obtaining any food.

Dog food: Court documents say that the children told authorities they resorted to eating the pet dog's food to avoid punishment and in order to to survive

'The alarm was right in front of the hallway to go into the kitchen, so if you went past that it would go off,' the court heard.

The boy also said he had been forced to drink his own urine.

Doctors at the Doernbecher Children's Hospital, pictured, who examined the couple's 13-year-old son reported he had the weight and height of a six-year-old

A doctor examining the boy in 2008 said he had the weight and height levels of a six-year-old, and that he suffered severe malnutrition, hypothermia, a slow heart rate and muscle wastage.

He was also diagnosed with psychosocial dwarfism - a growth impairment believed to be caused by severe environmental stress.

A doctor had estimated the boy was 10 inches shorter than a normal, healthy child of his age.

Meanwhile the Trebilcocks themselves, especially Jeffrey, were described as overweight in court documents, and their four biological children also showed signs of being fed properly.

Ironically, the father's job included delivering meals to schoolchildren in the area, as part of his work as a warehouse driver for Longview School District.

The Trebilcocks' lawyer claimed the adopted children were well cared for, however, and accused them of giving conflicting statements to the court.

'Over the course of a number of interviews, some of them rather lengthy, (they) did tell a number of different renditions of what happened in the family home during the time they were there,' Ted Debray told the judge in a statement reported by Fox News.

He also said the boy's unusually low weight was caused by illness.

The Trebilcock children, both biological and adopted, were home educated and never enrolled in local schools.
