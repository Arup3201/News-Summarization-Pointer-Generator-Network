Fiorentina president Andrea Della Valle is hopeful that Chelsea target Juan Cuadrado will not leave the Serie A club in January.

The Colombian winger has been strongly linked with a move to the Barclays Premier League leaders in the winter transfer market and has a buy-out clause set at £26.8million.

Fiorentina have rejected Chelsea's offer of £20.6million for Cuadrado, who is tied to the Viola until June 2019.

Chelsea are reportedly ready to meet the winger's £26.8m buyout clause to bring him to Stamford Bridge

When asked about the English club's interest in Cuadrado, Della Valle told the club's official website: 'The buy-out clause is there.

'We put it (buy-out clause) high in order to keep him (Cuadrado).

'I hope he will stay with us for a long time.'

Cuadrado was one of the stand-out players alongside James Rodriguez for Colombia in last year's World Cup in Brazil.

The 26-year-old joined Fiorentina in 2012 from Udinese and has been a regular in Vincenzo Montella's side since.

The Colombian has scored four goals and set up four more in 16 league appearances for Fiorentina this season.

Cuadrado started in Sunday's 1-1 draw against Roma that lifted the Florence outfit to sixth in the Serie A table.

Fiorentina have qualified for the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia and will take on Tottenham in the last 32 of the Europa League next month.
