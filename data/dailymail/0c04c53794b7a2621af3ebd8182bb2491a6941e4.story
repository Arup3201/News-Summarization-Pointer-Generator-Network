The White House has denied rumors that President Obama was due to appear on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show, saying he considered it, but turned it down

The White House has denied rumors that President Obama was set to make a 'surprise' appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show on Wednesday night.

The President has been taking part in a fundraising drive on the West Coast and was due to pass through Los Angeles, where the show is recorded, tomorrow evening.

Appearing on the light-hearted Kimmel show as two major world crises continue to worsen in both Gaza and Ukraine could have caused controversy for Obama.

Having already appeared on TV with the likes of David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon, Obama's travel plans sparked speculation that he would feature for an hour slot on Kimmel's show.

According to TMZ sources at the LAPD and ABC Network confirmed the rumors, saying that the President would film a special segment, a large part of which would be 'serious'.

TV Guide shows that on Wednesday, Kimmel has a performance from Common scheduled, with no other guests listed.

But the White House and a representative for the show later denied the President would feature.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told the LA Times: 'In advance of the trip, we've been in touch with Kimmel's folks about the president doing his show.

'We elected not to do it this time, but hope we can arrange to do it in the near future.'

Obama has already been criticised for attending multiple fundraising events while on his visit to the West Coast, despite the escalating situation in both Gaza and Ukraine.

Obama flies to fundraisers fro Democratic candidates in Seattle and San Fransisco on Tuesday before arriving in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

There, he will attend local Democratic National Committee events scheduled for Wednesday night and Thursday and will also appear Thursday at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College.

Fans of the show took to Twitter to discuss the news and some mocked Obama, with user Jonah Goldberg saying 'Unforeseen fundraiser get in the way?' and Jeannie Bondie adding: 'So just fundraisers, then?'.
