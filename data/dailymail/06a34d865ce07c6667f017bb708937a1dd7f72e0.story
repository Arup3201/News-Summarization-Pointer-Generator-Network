Labour leader Ed Miliband wants to block the UK Independence Party from having a role in the TV leader's debates, it emerged today.

The Tories were already opposed to the idea of giving UKIP leader Nigel Farage equal status ahead of the 2015 general election.

Labour had thought UKIP would only damage the Tories' election hopes.

But strategists now fear UKIP's 'brand of anti-politics could damage all three main parties in unpredictable ways,' The Guardian reported.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside David Cameron and Gordon Brown.

Spotlight: Labour has joined the Tories in blocking UKIP leader Nigel Farage from the leader's debates held in the build up to the General Election

Until recently Labour had hoped to 
capitalise on the rise of UKIP, hoping it would split the centre-right 
vote and allow them to clinch crucial swing seats.

But recent polls suggest UKIP has taken support from all the main parties.

A source close to Ed Miliband insisted no final decision had been made on UKIP's involvement.

'We've got to get David Cameron to agree to it first.

'Without him there will be no debates, then we'll worry about keeping Farage out.'

In the Eastleigh by-election UKIP came second pushing the Tories into an embarrassing second.

A
poll by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft found UKIP attracted the 
support of 22 per cent of people who voted Tory in 2010, 19 per cent of 
Lib Dem supporters and 17 per cent of Labour voters.

Lord Ashcroft has also warned Prime Minister David Cameron that he faces defeat at the general election in two years’ time.

The Tories’ biggest donor of the last
decade put together a poll suggesting Labour will gain 109 seats at the
2015 election, including 93 from the Conservative Party.

The predicted result by the former 
deputy chairman of the Conservatives would make Ed Miliband prime 
minister and give Labour a House of Commons majority of 84 seats.

Lord Ashcroft told the Financial Times:
‘Even now, 16 years after they dismissed us from office, many people 
who would once have been natural supporters still do not think the party
is on their side.

‘Mr Cameron faces the unenviable task of showing, at a time of austerity, that his party is not just for those who have already achieved material success, while holding on to Tory loyalists and luring back those threatening to defect to UKIP.’

The main three political parties have all seen the threat posed by UKIP increase over the past few years.

Conventional election wisdom among Labour had been that UKIP would only significantly harm the Tories.

But there is growing concern among Labour ranks that the anti-EU party could fatally undermine its support also.

The
recent high-profile defection to UKIP of a family member of a former Labour 
Cabinet minister has compounded that fear.

Liz Shore, the widow of Peter who served as Trade Secretary under Harold Wilson and Environment Secretary in Jim Callaghan's government, will stand for UKIP in elections to Cornwall's unitary council.

Mrs Shore, 85, said: 'I have been against the Common Market since day one and voted against it in the referendum in 1975 – but this is for county not for country.'

Her daughter Tacy and and her husband Bob have also moved from Labour to UKIP to stand in Thursday's poll.

The new bid to block UKIP from the leaders debates and shore 
up their own vote came as Labour's economic plan descended into chaos 
today when leader Ed Miliband refused 10 times to admit that he would be
borrowing more if he were Prime Minister.

Borrowing fell only slightly last year to £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12.

Mr Miliband was challenged repeatedly on how his promises to spend billions more on tax cuts and job creation schemes.

But during tetchy exchanges on BBC Radio
4 he refused to admit he would have to borrow more money to fill the 
budget black hole in his plans, including a £28billion bill for his 
Alternative Queen's Speech.

In a further embarrassment for Labour, party officials were forced to ‘clarify’ remarks by Mr Miliband in which he appeared to suggest he would look to cut universal benefits for wealthy pensioners.

He revealed during the interview that the Winter Fuel Allowance ‘needs to be looked at’, suggesting he would oppose Tory promises to protect benefits for all pensioners.

But minutes later senior sources insisted the party position that it would protect the handouts had not changed.

The Tories seized on the interview as proof Labour’s economic policy was in a ‘mess’.

Significantly, Mr Miliband refused to say a Labour government would borrow billions more than the coalition, despite shadow chancellor Ed Balls conceding the point in recent weeks.

Borrowing has remained stubbornly high for Chancellor George Osborne. It fell only slightly last year to £120.6billion, just £300million lower than in 2011-12.
