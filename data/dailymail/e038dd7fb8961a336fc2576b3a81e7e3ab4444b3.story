Fresh from a vital 2-1 victory over Roy Hodgson's England in their World Cup Group D opener, Italy also claim to have come out on top in the WAGs stakes in Manaus as well.

A Daniel Sturridge strike was not enough for England on the pitch as Italy prevailed thanks to goals from Claudio Marchisio and Mario Balotelli.

And Italian newspaper Gazzetta Dello Sport believe that the Italian women on display in Brazil were also far superior to their English counterparts.

In an article headlined 'WAGs absent - 
Italy triumphs in the battle of the wives', the newspaper cited Mario 
Balotelli's fiancee Fanny Neguesha and Alberto Aquilani's partner 
Michela Quattrochiocche as prime examples of Italian superiority.

Published yesterday before the match, the article in Gazzetta called the Italian WAGs 
‘beautiful’ and finished by saying: ‘Let’s just say the Italians win 2-0
 against the English. Now it’s down to the husbands.’

England can call upon Alex Gerrard, wife of captain Steven, Christine Bleakley, fiancee to Frank Lampard, and Coleen Rooney as three of their headline WAGs.

The article also described how the partners of Balotelli, Claudio Marchisio, Aquilani and Italian boss Cesare Prandelli
 would support the Azzurri at last night's match.

Marchisio’s wife Roberta, a former Italian tennis player, attended with their children, and ex-Liverpool midfielder Aquilani’s partner Quattrociocche was also present.

Other famous WAGs in the Italy camp include Daniele de Rossi's glamorous girlfriend Sarah Felberbaum and Thiago Motta's elegant wife Francisca.

Gianluigi Buffon, who was forced to miss last night's match with an injured ankle, is currently in the throes of a divorce from his wife, Czech supermodel Alena Seredova.

Equally miserable is playmaker Andrea Pirlo who was forced to seek solace with the Italy squad priest, Don Massimiliano Gabricci, after being dumped by his wife Deborah Roversi, following an alleged liaison with blonde Valentina Baldini, who he met at his golf club.

But while many of the Italian WAGs could be spotted in the stands, none of the England team is thought to have brought their partners to Brazil, although Coleen Rooney is on her way.
