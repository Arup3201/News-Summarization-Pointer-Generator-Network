FIFA says less than half of the tickets available for the World Cup opener next week went directly to the general public, with most being reserved to commercial partners, broadcasters, local organizers and hospitality programs.

FIFA said on Sunday that of the 61,600 tickets available for the Brazil-Croatia match on Thursday, only 25,630 were sold to the general public.

About 10,000 additional tickets are going to fans through promotional activities.

Not for fans: The Arena de Sao Paulo, which will host the opening game, will be full of sponsors and VIPs

Home support: The Brazil team may not be able to count on such strong backing from the corporate seats

In form: Croatia won their final warm-up 1-0 with a goal from Jelavic ahead of the opener on Thursday

Football's governing body said more than 1,500 tickets were reserved for VIPs, and about the same number is going to journalists.

More than 13,750 tickets went to hospitality programs, and 12,600 to commercial affiliates and broadcasters. Local organizers and the football community, including association members, received 6,600 tickets.
