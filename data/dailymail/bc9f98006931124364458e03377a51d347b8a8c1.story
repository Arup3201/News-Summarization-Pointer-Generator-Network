John Singleton made a rare on-air appearance on Ray Hadley's show on Saturday in support of the shock jock

2GB radio host and rugby league commentator Ray Hadley has lashed out at rival media outlets for their coverage of his split from wife of 20 years, Suzanne.

On Saturday he again used his own radio show to address the issue, which has played out this week after accusations he tried to have a football coach sacked because of his relationship with Hadley's estranged wife.

It comes after NSW State of Origin assistant coach Matt Parish denied having an affair with Suzanne Hadley, who he says he met only after she separated from the broadcaster.

'Now you keep meddling in people's lives, maybe one day I'll start to meddle in your private life,' Hadley said on his show on Saturday in a broadside directed at Sydney media.

John Singelton, owner of 2GB, made a rare appearance on air during Hadley's show defending the shock jock and making light of the media coverage.

According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, 'Singo' was dishing out some life advice during the slot, and said 'They always say glass half full, glass half empty...call me old-fashioned, but I'd rather see a glass thrown at some bastard's face.'

'Remember Ray, mate, you got a long way to go...you got three [marriages] to go to get me...so get used to it buddy,' he later added.

Parish's denial follows accusations from NSW head coach Laurie Daley that Hadley tried to 'exert his power and influence' to have the assistant coach sacked, by making private phone calls to the NSWRL.

'I didn't even know Suzanne before that,' Parish told The Daily Telegraph of his relationship.

'Whatever I am doing, it's my private life. It's being dragged through the mill by him (Hadley),' he added.

On Friday Hadley spoke out about his split from wife Suzanne for the first time, describing it as his 'biggest personal challenge'.

Mr Hadley addressed the accusations on his radio show on Friday morning, saying all he was trying to do was 'get some dignity from a very undignified situation'.

'I've never been one to be overwhelmed by things, but this year has provided me with no doubt my biggest personal challenge,' Mr Hadley said.

'At times I've felt like staying in bed and not coming here [to work].

'Listeners have to understand that despite the fact I'm on the wireless I face exactly the same problems off air as you do every day.'

Hadley phoned NSWRL CEO David Trodden last week and warned him that Parish should be 'more circumspect in matters relating to my wife', The Daily Telegraph reports.

Daley also claims Hadley is trying to 'derail' the Blues' entire Origin campaign, which has already been beset by the Mitchell Pearce controversy.

But Daley and Parish were supported unanimously at an unscheduled board meeting held on Monday following the phone call between Hadley and Trodden, according to the Telegraph.

On Friday Hadley said he has had one phone conversation with Daley, after Daley phoned him last Tuesday week.

'He was very supportive and offered his friendship, that’s a friendship that has been in existence for almost 30 years,’ he said.

'From my point of view nothing has changed.'

Hadley added: 'I've told my former wife previously and repeat today, I wish her well and hope she can find happiness.'

Hadley, who leads rugby league talkback show Continuous Call Team, used his 9am to midday slot on 2GB radio station to discuss the Blues, Daley and Trodden three times this week.

'He is using his personal attacks on me on air as a way of getting to Matt Parish,' Daley said.

Hadley last night denied having put any pressure on NSW officials to dump Parish from the Origin staff.

He has admitted he spoke to Trodden about Parish and his estranged wife, who have been seen together at NRL events.

'I simply asked Dave Trodden to advise Matt Parish to be more circumspect in matters involving my wife,' he said.

'I deny I asked for him to be sacked.'

Hadley has been married to Suzanne since 1994.

They are currently separated after she applied for an Apprehended Violence Order against him and his policeman son Daniel on Feb 20 and then withdrew it a few days later.

Earlier this week Blues halfback Mitchell Pearce was involved in a nightclub row after a woman claimed he approached her on the dance floor at a popular Sydney drinking spot.

The woman has declined to press charges over the incident and Pearce has been disciplined by his NRL club the Sydney Roosters but is still expected to be named in the NSW team for the first Origin match on May 28.
