Archaeologists believe they may finally have found the final resting place of King Richard III.

In a dramatic development after three weeks of digging under a council car park in Leicester, researchers today revealed they have found human remains in the spot it is believed he was buried.

The team is expected to details its findings at a press conference later today.

Richard Taylor, Director of Corporate
Affairs at the University of Leicester and one of the prime researchers behind the project, said: 'What we have uncovered is truly remarkable 
and today we will be announcing to the world that the search for King 
Richard III has taken a dramatic new turn.'

Over the past fortnight, the team has made several major discoveries - which have helped lead them to the monarch’s possible burial spot.

First they determined the area underneath the car park was the site of the medieval Franciscan friary known as Grey Friars.

Experts also found the site of the church within the friary - which also lead them to uncovering the lost garden of Robert Herrick.

The archaeologists, dubbed the Time Tomb Team, have now excavated the choir of the church - which is believed to be where King Richard III was buried.

The University of Leicester is leading the archaeological search for the burial place - with Leicester City Council, in association with the Richard III Society.

Leicester’s City Mayor Peter Soulsby said: 'This discovery adds a whole new dimension to a search which has already far exceeded our expectations.

'This is exciting news and I know that people across the world will be waiting to hear more about the university’s find.'

Philippa Langley from the Richard III Society added: 'We came with a dream and if the dream becomes reality it will be nothing short of miraculous.'

Is it him? Human remains have been found in the dig for the Plantagenet king, Richard III. The find comes after a three-week search of a Leicester car park.

Last week archaeologists from the University of Leicester, who are leading the search for the lost grave of King Richard III, announced that they have made a new advance in their quest.

They have uncovered evidence of the lost garden of Robert Herrick - where, historically, it is recorded there was a memorial to Richard III.

The team discovered paving stones which they believe belong to the garden.

In 1485 King Richard III was defeated at the battle of Bosworth.

His body, stripped and despoiled, was brought to Leicester where he was buried in the church of the Franciscan Friary, known as the Grey Friars.

Over time the exact whereabouts of the Grey Friars became lost.

he project, which began two weeks ago, has involved digging of two trenches at a council park - and this week a third trench was excavated.

Earlier this week, the archaeologists confirmed they had found the church of the Grey Friars and now they have found the garden outside the church.

Philippa Langley, of the Richard III Society, said: 'This is an astonishing discovery and a huge step forward in the search for King Richard's grave.

'Herrick is incredibly important in the story of Richard's grave, and in potentially helping us get that little bit closer to locating it.'

In the early 1600s, Alderman Robert Herrick, a mayor of Leicester, bought the land of the Grey Friars and built a large mansion house with a garden on the site.

In 1612, Christopher Wren, father of the famous architect, was visiting Herrick and recorded seeing a handsome three foot stone pillar in Herrick's garden.

Inscribed on the pillar was: 'Here lies the body of Richard III sometime King of England'. 

This is the last known record of the 
site of King Richard's grave. Richard is historically recorded as being 
buried in the choir of the Church of Grey Friars.

Thereafter,
in 1711, Herrick's descendants sold the mansion house and garden.

After
passing through various owners the mansion house was eventually pulled 
down sometime in the 1870s and the municipal buildings were built.

However, Herrick's garden seems to have remained a garden, or wasteland,
up until the 1930s - 40s when it was tarmacked over to become a car 
park.

Mrs Langley added: “The discovery of Herrick's garden is a major step forward and I'm incredibly excited.

The 69p stamp featuring Richard III

Born
in 1452, Richard III was King of England for two years, from 1483 
until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field.

According
to another tale, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the 
battle who foretold that 'where your spur should strike on the ride into
battle, your head shall be broken on the return'.

On
the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the Bow 
Bridge; legend has it that, as his corpse was being carried from the 
battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was 
broken open.Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle

He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty.

Although Richard III has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a 
hunchback and a withered arm, most historians now claim such an 
image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by 
Shakespeare.

'In locating what looks like one of the garden's pathways and, potentially, its central area which could have once held the three foot stone pillar marking the location of King Richard's grave, we could be that bit closer to finding the resting place of Britain's last warrior king.”

Mr Buckley, co-director of University of Leicester Archaeological Services, said the area of paving was found at its southern end, composed of re-used medieval tiles laid in a haphazard pattern. 

“The tiles were also extremely worn and of many different sizes.

'Although the date at which the paving was laid has yet to be confirmed, we suspect that it relates to the period of Herrick’s mansion.

'Interestingly, the 18th century map of Leicester shows a formal garden with a series of paths leading to a central point. 

“The paving we have found may relate to this garden, but it lies outside the church to the south.

'Inside the church in this third trench, further investigation has revealed some large fragments of window tracery which could well relate to the east window, behind the high altar.

If so, this may show that we are in the extreme east end of the building –near the choir where Richard III is said to have been buried.

“Having overcome the major hurdle of finding the church, I am now confident that we are within touching distance of finding the choir – a real turning point in the project and a stage which, at the outset, I never really thought we might reach.”

Work at the site will stop for a public open day between 11- 2 on Saturday September 8 and will resume next week.

The dig is being filmed by Darlow Smithson Productions for a forthcoming Channel 4 documentary to be aired later this year.

The Battle of Bosworth Field was 
fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War 
Of The  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and 
Lancaster.

One of the 
most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard 
III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best 
known quotations.

The leading role has been played by Laurence Olivier and Sir Ian McKellen, and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks.

The battle marked the final 
confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger 
Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster.

The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483.

Support
for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger 
brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. 
Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel.

Following
an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, 
Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485.

Gathering
support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and 
intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire.

After
Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII
and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted
until 1603.
