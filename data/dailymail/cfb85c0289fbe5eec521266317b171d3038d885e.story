A busy Victoria mother-of-two toddlers has been left stunned after nationwide bank Westpac asked to speak to her three-year-old boy before she could change any details on his savings account.

Michelle Morton rang Westpac's customer service hotline for their assistance in changing the address on her son Toby's account.

However, the bank refused to deal with Michelle, insisting that they speak directly with Tony the account holder, for privacy reasons.

Toby, who was sleeping at the time, was unable to come to the phone and Michelle was forced to hang-up and try again later.

The Bayside Mum-of-two said that she initially thought the customer service representative was joking by asking to speak to the three-year-old.

But it became apparent that they were not joking and Ms Morton was forced to  call back when Toby wasn't taking a nap.

A few days later, she called back again and put her little boy on to the phone to the Westpac worker.

However, Toby got stage fright and didn't say a word to the representative.

Speaking to the 7News, Ms Morton said she understood the company had strict policies to adhere to but the representatives should have used their common sense in this situation.

'I put him on the phone and he went all shy and scared,' Mrs Morton said.

'I appreciate privacy and they are obviously taking it very, very seriously, which is good, but I think sometimes common sense should prevail,' she said.

Wetpac has since been in contact with Ms Morton to apologise for the poor service.

The bank told Ms Morton that she will have to visit a Westpac branch should she wish to change Toby's account details, however, she has not found the time to visit.
