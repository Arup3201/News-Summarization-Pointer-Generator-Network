Fabio Capello would have pictured Rob Green in Rustenburg as Igor Akinfeev treated the ball like a bar of soap to gift South Korea a goal remarkably similar to Clint Dempsey’s for the USA four years ago.

For a second World Cup in succession the Italian’s plans for an opening game were undone by a goalkeeping clanger.

This time it came in Cuiaba when substitute Lee Keun-Ho advanced without challenge and struck a shot that should have been gathered easily only for Akinfeev to horribly misuse his hands and allow the ball to topple over the line.

The Italian, who turned 68 as this match switched from Tuesday to Wednesday in Britain, acted quickly and sent on veteran striker Alexander Kerzhakov, who rescued a point almost instantly by tapping in a rebound after a brilliant run and shot by fellow substitute Alan Dzagoev 16 minutes from time.

England fans remember the lacklustre 
football served up by Capello in 2010 and the savage manner of their 
elimination at the hands of Germany in the last 16. And for large 
periods this match was played in the same staid style.

He left 
Dzagoev, one of the stars for Russia at Euro 2012, on the bench and when
 he arrived Russia were immediately illuminated.

It was an odd call that
 chimed with some of his curious decisions from four years ago. He is 
paid handsomely to make such choices of course, to the tune of nearly 
£7million annually – the most of any manager in Brazil.

These two 
teams were the final pair to be getting their World Cup finals underway 
but it was hardly a case of saving the best till last. The first half 
was a turgid affair that lacked pace or penetration from either side.

That
 the only shot on target came via a thumped free-kick from 35 yards out 
says much. Russian centre-back Sergei Ignashevich decided to bypass any 
build-up play by striking straight for goal and forcing goalkeeper Jung 
Sung-Ryong into an unconvincing save.

By the end of the opening 
period Korea had enjoyed only four touches in the Russian box while 
Russia had just two in the Korean area.

The team from Asia did at 
least provide football that was attractive on the eye, with Swansea’s Ki
 Sung-Yeung, who spent last season on loan at Sunderland, performing his
 midfield role with usual balance and probing passing. His full-blooded 
tackle on Aleksandr Samedov that earned a booking showed he has an edge 
too.

Bayer Leverkusen striker Son Heung-Min could have had a couple 
if his finishing matched his reputation as the current Korean footballer
 of the year.

In the 10th minute he combined nicely with team-mates 
and ran at the Russian defence only to blaze his shot over, and 30 
minutes later he collected Arsenal striker Park Chu-Young’s header down,
 jinked into the area only to lash high and wide again.

The second 
half had more interest inside five minutes, with both goalkeepers 
looking decidedly uneasy against shots from distance.

Jung tipped wide Viktor Fayzulin’s effort then Igor Akinfeev was twice slow to reach strikes from Ki and Coo Ja-Cheol.

Kim
 Young-Gwon then almost embarrassed the 28-year-old with a 30-yard 
free-kick. In the 68th minute Lee went from range again and Akinfeev 
could do nothing to stop the goal.

It was a criminal error and it 
remains to be seen whether he is in place for the match against Belgium 
in the Maracana next. Green was dropped, of course.

Akinfeev has 
Kerzhakov, 31, to thank for salvaging a point six minutes later with his
 first touch. Dzagoev’s run was penetrating and his shot crisp. 
Kerzhakov pounced on the rebound to move level with Vladimir 
Beschastnykh’s Russian record of 26 goals.
