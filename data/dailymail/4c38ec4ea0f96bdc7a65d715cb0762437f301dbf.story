Arkansas Sen. John Boozman is 'awake and responsive' after undergoing emergency heart surgery on Tuesday at a hospital in the Senator's home state.

The Senator is still in recovery at the hospital, but 'doctors are pleased with the progress he has made,' his office said on Wednesday.

Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, pictured here at an event in February, had unscheduled heart surgery on Tuesday. His office said in a statement that, 'He is awake and responsive, and doctors are pleased with the progress he has made'

Early yesterday morning Boozman's wife, Cathy, took the Senator to Mercy Hospital in Rogers, Arkansas after her 
husband said he was experiencing pain in his chest and shoulder. At the hospital, doctors performed
 tests and found Boozman had an acute aortic dissection. The discovery prompted immediate surgery.

'He was, at the time of transport, alert, responsive and in good spirits despite the discomfort and pain,' his office said in a statement on Wednesday.

Congress is out of session until next week. Members of Congress are using the break to meet with constituents in their respective states.

The state's junior senator, Boozman, a Republican, had been scheduled for an 8 am appearance in Gravette, Arkansas to discuss a highway bypass project and President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. In the afternoon, he was to have spoken at a rural health center in Green Forest, Arkansas and at a housing agency in Harrison, Arkansas.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement he was 'glad to hear that John is doing well and we all look forward to having him back at work.'

'He is a fantastic Senator and a tireless advocate for Arkansas and the people he so proudly represents,' McConnell said.

Senior Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, a Democrat, said he is 'fortunate to call Senator Boozman a good friend and trusted colleague' and said he was keeping Boozman and his family in his prayers.

Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican who running for Pryor's Senate seat, said his 'thoughts and prayers' are with his 'friend and colleague' and his family, as well.

Boozman's family thanked well-wishers for their support on Wednesday, saying 'Our number one priority is 
making sure John makes a full recovery.'

'We know that if John had it his way he
 would be right back on the road in Arkansas, so the difficult part will
 be making sure he gets the rest he needs to get better,' the family's statement read.

Boozman's family also asked for privacy as the Senator recovers. It has asked the hospital not to give out the Senator's room number. Senator Boozman is not taking visitors at this time, his office said.
