With a degree in communications from one of the most prestigious universities in the world, the irony wasn't lost on Alex Harris.

While packing up his belongings during a house move, his wife noticed a rather unfortunate spelling mistake on his graduation certificate that had been hanging proudly on his wall for years.

Instead of the first vowel in the word 'communications' being an 'O', the document instead had a 'U' so that it read 'cummunications'.

Could have done with a spell checker: Alex Harris's diploma certificate for his degree in 'communications' from the University of California which actually reads 'cummunications' because of a rather embarrassing typo

Shocked: Mr Harris said his wife noticed the error when she was packing up their belongings while moving house after the certificate had been hanging on the wall for years

Mr Harris earned his mass communications diploma in 2008 from the University of California in Berkeley, which counts Nobel Peace Prize winners among its alumni, so he was completely taken aback by the error.

Speaking of the moment it was spotted, he told KLTV: 'I just heard this big laugh from the other room.

'She (his wife) actually noticed that there was this typo.

'When I saw it, it was just shock. You know, I looked at the keyboard and "O" and "U" are not next to each other.'

His story went viral after he uploaded a picture of his diploma to Reddit.

Mr Harris said the university had plenty of opportunities to ensure the certificate was correct after he had been forced to send two earlier copies back because they were wrinkled.

He admits that he thought the third one 'looked great' and hung it in his home for years not noticing the mistake.

But he says won't be in a rush to send this one back because it has become so famous.

'There's no way I'm giving this up,' he said.
