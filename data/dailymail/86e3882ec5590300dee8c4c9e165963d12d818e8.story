Sydney has failed to make it into the top ten of world's top cities in a new poll based on the impressions of 54,000 travellers.

While it did rank as the seventh most family friendly city in the world, Sydney's value for money and taxis failed to impress tourist.

The Cities Survey by TripAdvisor revealed that it ranked 19 out of the 37 best destinations based on 54,000 travelers who visited cities in 2013.

Tokyo was crowned the number one city in the world for best overall experience, followed by New York, Barcelona, Istanbul and Prague, Vienna, Berlin, Rome, Paris and Dubrovnik.

Results show that reviewers were moderately impressed by Sydney's attractions, which placed 12th on the list and restaurants ranked 15th.

Comfort for lone travelling and cleanliness both ranked 16th.

The survey was released on Tuesday, revealing how travellers view key tourist cities around the world.

The results were compiled based on more than 54,000 responses from those who have recently written TripAdvisor reviews for featured cities around the world.

London was trumped by New York as the best destination in the world for nightlife and shopping.

The UK capital was ranked second and third place respectively, while the American city scooped first and second place.

However,
 Dubai squeezed them both out of the top spot for shopping to be crowned
 the best destination on the planet for buying goods while on holiday.

London
 was rated the top city in Europe for shopping and nightlife, but was 
only ranked 32nd out of 37 destinations for helpful locals.

London only just failed to make it into the top 10, ranking in 11th place.

Tokyo
 scored top marks for helpfulness of locals, taxi service, local public 
transportation, and cleanliness of streets, ranking among the top ten in
 13 of 16 categories in the survey.

London scored highly for attractions (4th in the world), but less well on value for money (34th out of 37).

And with London’s taxi drivers made it into the top ten most friendly around the world.

As
 well as nightlife, New York City was also top of the heap for 
restaurants, and it came in second for best overall experience, shopping
 and attractions. 

Other
 high-ranking cities included Singapore, number one for comfort 
travelling alone, and second for taxi service, and family-friendliness; 
and Rome, which topped the list of attractions to do and culture.

The city of the iconic Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge (pictured) was named the 7th most friendliest city in the world
