Labour's flagship immigration policy was unravelling last night hours after it was launched.

Ed Miliband announced that all firms bringing in skilled staff from outside Europe should be forced to take on an equal number of ‘local’ apprentices.

The Labour leader, who has struggled to get on the front foot on immigration, said the policy would cut the recruitment of migrants by businesses and improve the skills of British youngsters.

But – under pressure from the Conservatives – Labour was later forced to admit that the 125,000 apprenticeships envisaged by the scheme would be open to youngsters from across the European Union.

The idea also met a backlash from the business lobby, which warned the new ‘apprentice tax’ would damage competitiveness and fail to tackle immigration.

'Immigration benefits Britain': John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses should be able to choose the talents and resources the need

A Shadow Cabinet source insisted the policy had been discussed with senior industry figures, adding: ‘Business is cool with this.’

But Simon Walker, of the Institute of Directors, said the initiative would make it ‘even harder’ for firms to take on staff.

‘Several of Labour’s proposals are completely removed from reality and betray the fact that their authors can have had no experience of running a business,’ he said.

‘Compelling companies to take on an apprentice for every non-EU employee is a daft policy which would damage many small and medium-sized businesses just as they are starting to grow.’

John Longworth, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘This is an apprentice tax on employers and job creation.

‘It serves neither to control immigration, where we should have a points system linked more strongly to economic benefit, nor help young people, who should be encouraged and properly supported rather than being used to control immigration by other means.

Businesses need to be able to choose the talents and resources they need, and sometimes cannot find in the UK. This immigration benefits Britain.

Pressure: Ed Miliband announced that all firms bringing in skilled staff from outside Europe should be forced to take on an equal number of ¿local¿ apprentices

‘Penalising good companies by making the grant of a work permit conditional on taking on a UK apprentice just raises business costs and new red tape.’

Rumours abounded yesterday that Ed Miliband had had voice coaching to improve his public image.

His voice appeared to have dropped an octave when he made a pre-conference appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday.

Mr Miliband’s nasal voice has been the subject of speculation, especially over a 2011 nose operation to correct a deviated septum.

Labour sources denied voice coaching, saying a cold might explain his deeper voice.

The last Labour government’s ‘open door’ policy on migrants has faced fierce public criticism and Mr Miliband yesterday said he wanted a future administration to cut immigration levels.

‘I do want to get low-skill immigration down and therefore overall immigration down,’ he said.

The centrepiece of his plan, which he said would be in Labour’s first Queen’s Speech, would be the new policy on apprentices, affecting all firms employing more than 50 people.

Mr Miliband said: ‘Any firm that wants 
to bring in a foreign worker from outside the EU will also have to train
up someone who is a local worker.’

Tory sources quickly pointed out that 
the measure would be illegal under EU law unless youngsters from 
elsewhere in Europe were able to apply for the apprenticeships.

Labour later climbed down, admitting that young people from across the EU would be eligible.

A source said the ‘vast majority’ of the apprenticeships were likely to go to British youngsters. But critics last night pointed out that the posts would be attractive to young people in countries such as Spain, where youth unemployment is running at more than  50 per cent.

The Labour leader also announced he would increase fines on employers paying below the minimum wage from £5,000 to £50,000 as part of action against exploitation of migrant workers. He also said he wanted to see the minimum wage ‘go up over time’.

An attempt by Labour to restore its battered economic credibility was running into trouble last night before it had even been launched.

Journalists had been briefed that Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will today pledge to have the party’s tax and spending plans audited by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility to give them a gloss of respectability.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has written to the OBR's chairman Robert Chote asking him to amend the watchdog's charter to allow it to scrutinise Labour's plans

But last night it emerged that the OBR’s charter prevents it from offering a view on the spending plans of opposition parties.

The agency was set up by George Osborne to provide independent economic forecasts and scrutinise government spending plans.

Mr Balls has now written to the OBR’s chairman Robert Chote asking him to amend the watchdog’s charter to allow it to scrutinise Labour’s plans.

The move came after Treasury minister Sajid Javid released an analysis by officials which he said showed Labour promises would require more than £1,000 extra borrowing per household in 2015.

The analysis suggested Labour’s plans would blow a £28billion black hole in the nation’s finances.

Mr Balls dismissed the report as ‘nonsense’. But today he will acknowledge the importance of having Labour’s election plans fully costed to give voters confidence in them.

He will say: ‘In tough times it’s even more important that all our policies and commitments are properly costed and funded. 

‘The British people rightly want to know that the sums add up. So we will go one step further and ask the independent OBR – the watchdog set up by this Government – to independently audit the costings of every individual spending and tax measure in Labour’s manifesto at the next election.

‘This is the first time a shadow chancellor – the first time any political party in Britain – has ever said it wants this kind of independent audit. A radical change from what’s gone before, but the right thing to do to help restore trust in politics.’ 

Mr Balls will concede that Labour will face more tough choices and admit that growth and jobs ‘cannot magic the whole deficit away at a stroke’.
