The man beaten and robbed by thugs during the London riots died in hospital late last night as it emerged he had suffered at the hands of yobs for years.

After three days spent on a life support machine Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, died as a result of the serious head injuries he sustained at the height of the riots on Monday night.

He was set upon by thugs and knocked over as he tried to stamp out a fire. 

Today, stunned residents left floral tributes at the spot where Mr Bowes was attacked. Others paid tribute to the 'local hero' who 'upheld the British way of life'.

And as detectives today questioned a 22-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder, it has emerged Mr Mannington Bowes was a 
civic-minded man of old fashioned values who had been forced to confront
yobs on his own doorstep for years.

The reclusive former accountant had 
long been tormented by thugs who urinated on his front door and threw 
litter outside his home, according to friends and neighbours.

However, his courage and habit of never walking away from something he considered wrong eventually cost him his life.

Police said next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course.

Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command said: ‘This was a brutal incident that resulted in the senseless killing of an innocent man.

‘I still need the assistance of the community who may have witnessed the attack on Richard, to come forward and provide information or images they may have recorded on mobile devices. This information could be crucial in catching his killer.’

Prior to his death, his sister last 
night spoke of her distress at his plight and Mayor of London Boris 
Johnson described him as a ‘hero’. In fact, it was the first time in 30 
years that Mr Bowes and his sister, mother of three Anne Wilderspin, 73,
have been in contact.

Mrs Wilderspin, who lives in Derbyshire, has travelled down to London to see her gravely ill brother.

‘I
was shocked,’ she told ITV news. ‘It was sort of unreal because you 
don’t think anything like that happens to a relative of yours.

‘We’ve been horrified by the reports 
of the riots. I’m very sad that we have to see him like this, but in one
way I’m very pleased that we could make contact again.’

Boris
Johnson, on a visit to see the riot damage in the West London suburb, 
said: ‘There are many villains in this story but also many heroes and I 
want to pay particular tribute to Mr Bowes.

‘But he has paid a terrible price. I am desperately sorry for him.’

Neighbours
described Mr Bowes, who lived alone in a flat overlooking Haven Green, 
as a man who would always stand up to trouble makers.

One local businessman, who was himself being attacked, said: ‘Mr Bowes had a real civic pride.

‘He was a very quiet man who cared 
greatly about his neighbourhood. We do have some drunks at the weekend 
occasionally causing trouble and Mr Bowes would always challenge them 
and tell them off.

‘He was a true gentleman who had old fashioned values.’

Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said the investigation could turn into a murder inquiry and appealed for Mr Bowes’s assailant to give himself up.

A handful of police had arrived at 10.45pm on Monday to reports of looting in Ealing. Massively outnumbered, they called for back-up as they were showered with missiles and saw Mr Bowes being attacked.

Bystander father-of-four Peter Firstbrook dragged the pensioner away from the fire.

The 60-year-old documentary filmmaker, who broke through the lines of rioters to help, said: ‘There were about 120 youths. One of them, a big black lad in his early twenties, approached me and said something like: "There’s one of your lot over there and he’s injured".'

‘Three young lads from the crowd also seemed quite concerned and helped me drag him to an alleyway. He was unconscious and had blood coming from his ear. There were no external injuries.’

Patrick Kennedy, 68, the landlord of the block of flats near where he was fatally injured, described his death as a tragedy. 

Speaking at the scene today, Mr Kennedy said: 'He was a very kind man with old English values. He was a decent man who always upheld the British way of life which, sadly, is a diminished figure.

'I know he lived alone, but I would always see him walking about in his shorts. He was always happy which is so refreshing. He used to be an accountant, but he retired years ago. 

'He was very dignified and never spoke about himself or gave any clues about his background. The only clue was his double-barrelled name. 

'Ealing is quite a decent community and we usually know each other quite well. It is shocking that this should have happened, a tragedy. He set out a moral way of life.'

Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell, who also visited the scene to pay his respects, said he would support a petition to re-name the Mews after Mr Bowes.

He said: 'I think as a borough we need to pay tribute to this man and I think it is a great idea.  We have a special council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the riots and the aftermath and all the consequences of it and we will begin that by paying tribute to Mr Bowes with one minute's silence. 

'We have street naming and numbering sections in the council and they would deal with that petition, but as the leader of the council I would also be asked. 

'The Mayor has already said that he is going to set up a fund to help the victims of the riots and that includes Mr Bowes' family. 

'It is deeply shocking for everyone in the community and the incident that happened here was terribly tragic. For all the residents of Ealing, our hearts go out to his family and we hope that someone is charged for the actions of the thugs which, sadly, turned into murder. 

'He was just doing the right thing and was set up on by people with no values or humanity. I knew for some time that he was very ill and was critical because the police told me. 

'I feel despair, sadness and anger, a mixture of all these feelings and emotions. How can people do  such things? For an innocent man to lose his life is awful. 

'In the borough we have pockets of deprivation, but Ealing town centre is relatively prosperous. I would never have dreamt that this could happen, that a riot here could result in a man being murdered.'

Tributes left at the scene included one from staff at the local shopping centre outside which Mr Bowes had been trying to stamp out a fire.  It read: 'Whilst trying to help he was attacked and died, look after him God - at least he tried. RIP Richard, from Arcadia Centre Staff.'

Another read: 'Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Your bravery hasn't gone unnoticed. Rest in peace knowing these savages will pay.'
