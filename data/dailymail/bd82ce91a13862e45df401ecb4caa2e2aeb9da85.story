Two police officers has secretly been caught on camera detaining and interrogating two men for stopping to say hello to someone on the street.

The confronting scene - which goes for over 16 minutes and was uploaded to YouTube - was captured on a cell phone unbeknownst to the officer in charge, who seems to be under the impression he turned the device off.

During the course of the video, the officer in charge, Phillip Nace of the 25th District, appears to threaten violence, use derogatory language and accuse the men of being drug dealers.

The video - purportedly taken on September 27 - is called 'Police unlawful harassment and racial profiling,' but the race of the two pedestrians is unclear.

It starts as two officers in the suburbs of Northern Philadelphia pull up next to two men asking them why they were talking to another man on the street.

One of the men starts to record the encounter on his cellphone seconds later.

Officer Nace gets out of his car and approaches, saying: 'You don't say hi to strangers.'

As the situation unfolds, with the men arguing they have done nothing wrong, the phone - now sitting on the hood of the police car - picks up a voice-only recording of the officers attempting to explain they are within their rights to stop and search whomever they want.

They claim to have saw the men jaywalk and say they 'may' have recieved a call for a robbery involving two men of their description. 

Officer Nace: 'You asked me why I stopped you, I said how you know we didn't get a radio call/ You're looking at it from where you are, but you're not looking at it from where we are. You don't know what we know or what we got information on, right? Right? What - you don't hear now?'

Man: 'You accusing me of robbing someone?'

Officer Nace: 'I didn't accuse you of anything, can you hear? I said we could have got a call that somebody wearing the clothes that you're wearing just robbed someone, that's why we stopped you, so is that wrong of us?'

Officer Nace also threatens violence, saying: 'Don't fucking play though, you'll be on the same f---ing block as him. We'll kick your ass too.'

Approach: Officer Phillip Nace is at the centre of the video, which is gaining major traffic online

At another point officer Nace is also heard saying: 'You're gonna be in violation if you keep running your mouth when I split your wig open.'

The two officers then discuss arresting the men simply because they don't like them.

'You should take that one just for his friggin' big mouth,' one cop says.

'Well they crossed the street on a red light, so...' the other replies.

Later in the video, the cops begin making derogatory comments and taunting one of the men.

'Well then don't come to fucking Philadelphia, stay in Jersey,' one says.

'I have family out here,' the man replies.

'Yeah well then don't come over here, we don't want you here anyway, all you do is weaken the fucking country,' the officer hits back.

'Yeah? I weaken the country? How I weaken the country? By working?'

'No, freeloading.'

When the man explains he works as a server at a country club, the cop replies: 'Serving weed?'

A police spokesperson told the Daily News that internal affairs is investigating the incident and that that the investigation, not the video, would determine the outcome. 

Last year, Lt. Jonathan Josey was fired after a YouTube video went viral
of him punching a woman in the face and knocking her to the ground.

Lt. Jonathon has since returned to the job.
