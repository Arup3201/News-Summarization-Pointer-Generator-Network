The free apps will be made available on the BlackBerry App World from Wednesday until December 31

Blackberry today announced it is offering free apps worth Â£63 to appease customers hit by its three-day global blackout.

Research in Motion, the Canadian company behind the phones, attracted widespread anger after millions around the world were unable to access email, surf the web or use the BlackBerry Messenger service.

Many vented their fury on Twitter and other social networking sites.

The problems began last Monday and services were only fully restored by Thursday.

RIM said the selection of 
premium apps will be offered as 'an expression of 
appreciation for their patience' during the disruptions.

The apps will be available on the BlackBerry App World from Wednesday October 19 until December 31.

The move to repair the damage to its reputation comes as a survey last week revealed that one in five BlackBerry users were considering switching to another supplier following the problems.

Even BlackBerry's 'core' business - providing secure email and messaging to business - seems to be under threat.

Financial institutions such as Morgan
Stanley and the Royal Bank of Scotland are reportedly trialling iPhones
and iPads within their management teams.

BlackBerry has posted a partial list of the apps it is to offer. They include:

'I'm not sure that the business users 
who rely on BlackBerry for important messages are going to be 
satisfied,' says Will Findlater, editor of Stuff magazine.

More than 1,000 
customers quizzed by shopping comparison website Kelkoo found that 19 
per cent were thinking about moving to another manufacturer.

Meanwhile,
42 per cent said they would consider changing later and eight per cent 
said they had already bought a new mobile phone.

Research among another 3,000 people found that seven out of 10 who were 
planning to get a BlackBerry in the future admitted they would need some
reassurance from the manufacturer as they would be put off by last week's problems.

Announcing
the free apps RIM co-chief executive Mike Lazaridis said: 'Our global 
network supports the communications needs of more than 70 million 
customers.

'We truly appreciate and value our relationship with our customers.

'We've worked hard to earn their 
trust over the past 12 years, and we're committed to providing the high 
standard of reliability they expect, today and in the future.'

Free apps will include SIMS 3, Bejeweled, Bubble Bash 2 and Shazam Encore.

Mr Lazaridis said: 'We are grateful to our loyal BlackBerry customers for their patience.

Announcing the free apps, RIM co-chief executive Mike Lazaridis said today: 'We've worked hard to earn their [Blackberry's customers] trust over the past 12 years, and we're committed to providing the high standard of reliability they expect, today and in the future'

'We have apologised to our customers and we will work tirelessly to restore their confidence.

'We are taking immediate and aggressive steps to help prevent something like this from happening again.'

What began as a minor inconvenience a 
week ago today had turned into an fiasco by Tuesday morning as problems 
spread throughout Europe and the Middle East before hitting users in India 
and Latin America.

By Wednesday the problems had reached America and Canada.

At least ten million of the company's 70million users encountered disruption, reporting problems with email, web
browsing and instant messaging following the server crash at the firm's
data centre in Slough, Berkshire.

The firm said it had problems with its 'core switch', a series of specialised computers which receives and redirects millions of 
emails and messages every minute.

BlackBerry's limited number of data centres worldwide has been blamed for a number of failures in the past, as well as the current three-day outage
