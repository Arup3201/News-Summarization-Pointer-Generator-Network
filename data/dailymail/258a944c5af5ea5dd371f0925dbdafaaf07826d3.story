Theives could not have picked a less conspicuous car when they made off with a Rolls Royce limousine while its driver was putting air in its tyres at a petrol station.

A Belle Classic Limousines driver made a stop at the Scarborough BP - north-west of Perth in Western Australia - to fill up his fuel tank at 11.55pm on Tuesday, according to WA Police.

Police initially reported the car was stolen while the man was inside the station paying for his petrol.

But a Belle Classic Limousines spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the driver was pumping up his tyres at the time of the incident.

Police mounted a search for the luxury vehicle on social media.

They canvassed a photo of the white classic car with the number plate 88BELLE and eventually it was found.

The vehicle was found parked at Quinns Rocks - almost 30 kilometres north from where it was stolen - about 1.30pm on Wednesday.
