Sir Richard Branson has spoken of his agony as he watched his son Sam  being airlifted from the Matterhorn during a charity hike after falling ill, unable to help him as he circled in a helicopter running low on fuel.

The 29-year-old was taken seriously ill with extreme altitude sickness as he neared the summit.

He couldn't breathe and was retching uncontrollably, so his guides radioed for him to be extracted by air. He did, however, manage to reach the top before he was flown to safety.

The ascent to the summit of the 14,700-foot peak, which straddles the Swiss-Italian border, was undertaken as part of the Virgin Strive Challenge - and Branson senior, 64, watched the drama unfold from a helicopter at the end of last month.

He told MailOnline how he felt helpless watching from above.

He said: ‘I obviously didn't know that Sam was throwing up and had a horrendous headache that developed from altitude sickness.

‘I thought everything was going great. It was a beautiful day. We were circling the Matterhorn and had one door open. He was advised not to get to the top but I can understand having got to close that he went for it.

'I could see everyone huddling round somebody. He was retching and was in quite a bad way.

'Then, just as we were heading down, we saw an ambulance helicopter going up. We were short of fuel, so we landed.

'Then we heard that Sam had been medevaced off the top. They dangled him out of the door! He said he opened his eyes and saw the mountain spinning below him, so he felt even sicker than he did before. He was clutching his guide.

'They dropped him down to where we all were. He was shaken, but pleased that he'd accomplished the top of the Matterhorn, despite a slightly less than satisfactory end from his point of view.'

He added: 'He was brought up watching me doing foolish things, whether it's transatlantic sailing records or going round world in balloons. I’m sure a bit of adventure bug has rubbed off on him. I’m a great believer to see what you're capable of and pushing yourself to the limits.' 

Sam told MailOnline that it involved a gigantic effort to reach the top.

He said: 'One of the guides, mountaineer Kenton Cool, who’s summited Everest 11 times, told me 200 metres from the top that I’d have to be choppered down. He said: “If you dig deep we can get you to the top.”

‘Each step I would retch and cry. My team were being brilliant. They helped me push through the pain. They were heroes.’

Agony: Sam described how near the summit he would take one step and retch, then another step and retch again

Sam was then picked up by a helicopter, which took him away as he dangled from a winch while attached to a rescuer.

He said: 'They have to get off mountain because the winds can be so unpredictable, so they fly straight off. I had my eyes closed! I was in shock and not in the best way. I was emotionally drained and feeling sick. And the flight really freaked me out.’

He continued: ‘It was an epic ending to an epic adventure and I’m just glad everyone got down safely.’

The Matterhorn is known in the climbing community as being a challenging peak. Sam added: ‘There are sections where if you fall, you’re dead. And it gets more technical the higher you get.’

Virgin Strive Challenge participants are raising money for the Big Change project, a charity set up by six friends including Sam Branson, Holly Branson and Princess Beatrice, which gives youngsters in the UK a chance to develop their non-academic skills.

The challenge involved three back-to-back marathons from London to Dover, rowing across the English Channel, cycling through France to Verbier, hiking the Haute Route to Zermatt and climbing the forbidding Matterhorn.

Over £600,000 has been raised to date.
