A pilot is lucky to have escaped with just a six-inch gash to his forehead after the engine of his two-seater plane failed and he was forced to crash land into the nearest stretch of water.

Tom Beaman, 61, was flying his single-engine Cessna 150 plane on Friday afternoon when he noticed the engine starting to ‘run rough.'

Experienced pilot Beaman quickly started to turn his plane around and was flying over Boca Ciega Bay, five miles west of Albert Whitted Airport in St Petersburg, Florida, when the engine suddenly quit.

Beaman escaped relatively unharmed once his plane hit the water as he was wearing his seat-belt and had a life jacket close to hand

‘I probably glided for a good two minutes before I actually hit,’ Beaman told News9.

‘All of a sudden the engine just stopped completely and I couldn't get it started. So, I called the tower and told them I was going down into Boca Ciega.’

Witnesses to the crash describe seeing the plane suddenly flip when it hit the water.

‘It was a scary sight,’ said John Dunn, who was in the middle of a business meeting at a local country club. ‘Once the wheels touched the water, the front just flipped.’

Fortunately for Beaman he escape relatively unharmed as he was wearing his seat-belt and had a life jacket close to hand.

‘I
 didn't think I was going to flip,’ he said. ‘I was going pretty slow 
but it was a lot more violent than I remember, than I imagined it would 
be.’

Fortunately Beaman wasn't seriously injured, although he did sustain a six-inch long gash to his forehead

Beaman was pulled from the water by a Good Samaritan and his plane sank within two minutes of the crash

Beaman was pulled from the water by a Good Samaritan and his plane sank within two minutes of the crash.

‘I didn't get knocked out but the next thing you know you're under water. Got the door open, live preserver on and was just going to swim in and then two boats came in and got me,’ said Beaman.

Fortunately he wasn’t seriously injured, although he did sustain a six-inch long gash to his forehead.

‘It's the first time in 43 years anything has happened,’ he explained to WTSP.com.

Beaman's wife Diane said he is very lucky he only suffered a few cuts from the crash.

The FAA is investigating the crash, but Beaman has said that he plans to fly again although first he'll need to get another plane.
