Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta has signed a new five-year contract with the club.

The 25-year-old has cemented the left-back berth at Stamford Bridge and played a big part in a strong start to the season for Jose Mourinho's men.

Known affectionately by Chelsea fans as 'Dave', Azpilicueta has made 95 appearances for the west Londoners since signing in 2012, scoring one goal along the way against Arsenal in last season's Capital One Cup.

The Spaniard has enjoyed an impressive start to the 2014/15 Premier League season as he continues in the left back role despite being predominately right footed. 

Azpilicueta has even been keeping Chelsea's summer signing Filipe Luis out of the starting line-up as Chelsea enjoyed an unbeaten start to the Premier League campaign with maximum points from three games.

He also scooped the Players' Player of the Year award at Chelsea last season before being called up for the 2014 World Cup with Spain.
