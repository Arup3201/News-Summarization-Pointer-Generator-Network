This is the shocking moment a thief was caught stealing flowers which had been laid in memory of a teenager who died after being hit by a lorry.

The CCTV shows the brazen passer-by taking his time to select the largest bouquet of flowers which had been left on Canal Street, Manchester, for Jack  Essex.

The 18-year-old had received serious head injuries after being hit amid heavy storms in the rush-hour collision on January 28.

In the CCTV, the man is seen confidently walking along Canal Street to the piles of tributes, before picking up one bunch of flowers. He then stands and looks through the pile again (pictured)

He died at Salford Royal Hospital the next day, with his family and partner Tony Cooper at his bedside.

Devastated friends and family have since built an impromptu shrine for the teenager, with flowers, teddies and cards.

But on Saturday morning, Mr Cooper realised some of the larger bouquets were missing. He then checked the CCTV from his bar, Via Fossa, which caught the thief in action.

Mr Cooper says it has left him and Jack's family 'devastated'.

He said: 'Both myself and Jack's family are devastated, all his friends are devastated too, that someone could do this.'

In the footage, the thief can be seen confidently walking up to the piles of tributes, before taking his time to browse the bouquets. 

He initially picks up one bunch of flowers, before again combing the tributes. He then picks up another two bouquets - including the biggest one - before walking away.

The CCTV was retrieved from Via Fossa, the bar run by Jack's partner Tony Cooper 

The incident happened around 5.50am on Saturday. Mr Cooper said he first noticed some of the bouquets were missing while he was having a coffee that morning. 

He said: 'I looked out and noticed some of the larger bouquets were missing.

'I went out and looked and then checked the CCTV. The thief walks along and takes his time and knows exactly what he is doing.

'Flowers have been gathering there since the accident and I think he has taken the three largest bouquets.'  

Jack, 18, received serious head injuries after being hit in the rush-hour collision on January 28

Footage has now been passed to police. Inspector Phil Spurgeon said the theft would add to the grief of Jack's family and friends. 

He said: 'Having spent time on Friday at the informal memorial to Jack, thinking about the tragedy, I can say with confidence that the thief knew exactly what the items were for.

'With Jack's family and friends struggling to come to terms with his sudden death, and planning for his funeral this week, the theft of items from the memorial will only serve to compound their grief.

'We will do everything we can do to bring the thief to justice and urge anyone with information to contact us.' 

After his death, Jack's family paid tribute to their ‘lovely bright boy’ and said he would donate his organs.

In a statement, they said: 'Our lovely bright boy Jack would be revelling in the amount of Facebook and Twitter activity.

'Jack’s partner, Tony, and Jack’s siblings Kat, Charlotte and Alex and parents John and Donna are deeply moved by the thousands of messages and tributes that have been made and continue to pour in.

'Jack had always expressed a wish to be an organ donor and Tony and his family have ensured that this wish has come true.

'This tragic accident has affected not only ourselves, but others including the driver of the vehicle concerned. Our thoughts are also with him and his family.' 

Celebrities such as Coronation star Kym Marsh were among those who paid respects.

In a tweet, the former Hear’Say singer said: 'My beautiful friend Jack passed away this evening. He will be missed beyond words.

'Sleep tight sweetheart. We will love you always xxx

'Absolutely devastated. What a beautiful guy he was inside and out. We will miss him terribly. Love you sweetheart xxx.'
