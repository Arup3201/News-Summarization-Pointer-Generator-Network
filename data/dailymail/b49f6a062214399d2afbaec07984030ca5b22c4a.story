Who doesn't want a washboard stomach, toned abs and buns of steal? Well, according to a controversial new theory from an Irish weight-loss expert, perhaps not as many of us as you'd think.

Sociologist Dr Bernadette Rock believes that desperate dieters often want to retain their flab -- even if they don't realise it.

Dublin based Dr Rock outlines her surprising theory on a Huffington Post blog, where she says that, despite common wisdom, there are many benefits to being overweight.

She goes on to suggest that when dieters struggle to stick to regimes,
they're often subconsciously sabotaging their own attempts 
because they want to retain their excess pounds.

Dr Bernadette Rock believes that acknowledging the reasons dieters might like being overweight will help them achieve their goal

'There are advantages to remaining overweight. If you are not aware of these benefits 
and why you're holding on to your extra weight, then no amount of 
dieting will keep those pounds at bay for good,' writes the sociologist, who runs HeyDay World, a non-dieting weight loss programme in Dublin.

Talking to the MailOnline about her controversial theory, Dr Rock explained, 'It surprises many people that being overweight can serve a function.

'While a part of you feels bad about being overweight and despises having extra weight, there may be another part of you that is holding onto it,' she says.

So what are these hidden benefits of carrying some extra inches? Dr Rock outlines four classic examples from clients:

1. "My reason for not doing things in life has been my weight. When I lose it, I won't have an excuse to put off life, such as applying for another job, or even getting on a flight"

2. "Having extra weight means I can blend into the background, without being the focus of attention, and I don't feel that I'm 'on show'"

3. "Weight makes me feel protected from other people. I think I might feel vulnerable if I lost it."

Dr Rock also refers to her personal weight loss experience. 'I recall feeling anxious or nervous about the increased personal power that I felt as the weight gradually fell off me,' she admits.

But says, 'Iâ€™ve had some angry responses to my blog from people who believe I am blaming them for their weight. This is partly because there is such a culture of blaming overweight people.

'Instead this blog seeks to encourage people to step back with awareness and bring more understanding and non-judgement to their weight and eating habits.'

What Dr Rock hopes is that readers will use this theory to help them on their weight loss journey.

'If you have recently 
lost weight and fear that you will gradually regain the pounds, then it 
is crucial that you look at the reasons why you might be holding onto 
extra pounds,' she says.

'During all of my 16 years dedicated to chronic dieting and feeling out of control around food, one of my enduring beliefs was that being slim meant I would be lighter, happier and confident.

'After a few weeks of being 'good' and in control (as opposed to tucking into toast with melted butter, biscuits and any food not nailed down) the result, when I stepped on the bathroom scales, was that my weight had dropped,' she says.

But she admits, 'Weeks of being good were suddenly unraveled in a moment of stress or anxiety. And isn't it amazing how much food you can eat in five minutes?'

The Irish expert then explains, 'I was desperately seeking slimness but never thought to ask myself "Why have I put myself in the position of being overweight again?", "Is a part of me holding onto my weight?"

'Although a part of you does not want that extra weight and desperately wants to shed it, is there another part of you holding onto that weight?

'You might never have considered these questions: Why have you chosen to be overweight? What's in it for you by being overweight?'

It's not surprising that when Dr Rock asks her clients if there are reasons they want to remain overweight, they usually respond with expression of incredulity and disbelief.

But she believes there are advantages to remaining overweight, which dieters have to confront before successfully shedding pounds.

'A new slim body means a smaller version of yourself. You no longer have the fat to protect you,' she says.

'You may feel more fragile and vulnerable. Having extra weight has protected you. Without it you may feel exposed. That's one reason why many people who lose weight regain it.'

Dr Rock concludes, 'If you are not aware of the benefits of your weight and your concerns about letting it go, you will struggle to reach and maintain a healthy weight.'
