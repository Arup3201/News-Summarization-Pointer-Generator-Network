The health care worker who returned from Sierra Leone and sparked a Ebola scare in the U.S. after she was pulled off a United Airlines flight at Newark does not have Ebola. 

The woman, whose name has not been released, reportedly vomited aboard United flight 45 from Brussels and suffered from a high fever and was taken to Hackensack Medical Center.

But a spokesman for Hackensack Medical Center said in a statement despite her symptoms she has been declared 'Ebola free.'

Health workers in hazmat suits met the passenger on the plane at Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday afternoon

The woman was taken off and sent to Hackensack University Medical Center, whe she was tested for Ebola and was being held on Tuesday

Doctors said when the woman arrived at the hospital she was not showing signs of infection.

And despite preliminary tests indicating she did not have the virus, she was kept overnight into Tuesday 'in an abundance of caution' and released from the hospital in the evening.

Hackensack University Medical Center is one of the state's three hospitals which is 'Ebola ready' and able to tackle  cases of the deadly virus.

Eyewitnesses said the emergency room entrance was blocked off as a precaution as the patient was evaluated overnight.    

The Bergen County Record reported that the woman was returning to the US from Sierra Leone, a West African nation where health workers are still working to bring Ebola under control. 

The virus has infected an estimated 10,000 people there and killed more than 3,000. 

The woman is reportedly a health worker who was returning from the Ebola-afflicted nation of Sierra Leone in West Africa

Passengers told the Record that healthcare workers in hazmat suits met the plane when it landed about 2pm on Monday. 

E.E. Charlton-Trujillo, who was on the flight, said neither airline officials nor health authorities offered an explanation for what happened on the plane, but fear quickly spread through the cabin. 

'Everyone's thinking Ebola,' she told the Record. 

A Twitter user on board the plane said authorities had passengers fill out health forms and that responders were in hazardous materials suits.

There were 248 passengers and 14 crew members on United Airlines Flight 45 from Brussels, a spokesman said.

At present, passengers flying into either Newark or John F. Kennedy airports from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea have their temperature taken.

This is done with the use of no-touch thermometers upon landing and they are then monitored for symptoms for 21 days. 

Authorities stressed that even  it was highly unlikely that the woman would have infected anyone else aboard the plane.

Doctors say the woman no longer had a fever when she arrived at Hackensack University Medical Center 

Passengers were given health forms to fill out and told the contact health officials if they experienced any symptoms of the virus

Flight: Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for United said that a passenger had become ill on a flight that arrived in Newark from Brussels on Monday afternoon

Despite sporadic scares of possible Ebola cases in the tri-state in recent months, to date,  only one person, Dr. Craig Spencer from Manhattan, has been diagnosed with the virus in the tri state area. 

He was successfully treated at Bellevue Hospital in early November after returning from Guinea while working with Doctors Without Borders. 

Yesterday, Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for United said that a passenger had become ill on a flight that arrived in Newark from Brussels on Monday afternoon.

He told CNN: 'After arriving at Newark airport from Brussels, medical personnel met a United flight to assist an ill passenger on board.

'Passengers and crew stayed on the plane until the medical personnel cleared the aircraft.'

As of this month, the World Health Organization says at least 8,594 people have died in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. 

In Liberia there were 3,587 deaths. Sierra Leone had 3,132 deaths and Guinea 1,875 deaths.

The current outbreak, which began about a year ago, has also claimed more than a dozen lives elsewhere.

The death toll from the current Ebola outbreak has reached 8,594 people with as many as 21,614 infected according to the World Health Organization.

It describes Ebola symptoms as the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and tissues of infected animals or people. 

And people remain infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus. 

There is no known cure or vaccine for the disease but the incubation period is two to 21 days.

Liberia has had 3,587 deaths, Sierra Leone 3,132 deaths and Guinea 1,875 deaths.  

However, there have also been cases reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, Great Britain and the United States. 

The current outbreak, which began about a year ago has claimed more than a dozen lives elsewhere.

In the U.S. at least 10 people, mostly health care workers have been treated and only two of those patients have died. 

The American Ebola Survivors include: Amber Vinson, Dr. Kent Brantly, Nina Pham, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra, and Ashoka Mukpo.
