Estate agents will wax lyrical about even the most unassuming property – but this time, they really do have something to sing about.

The country estate which inspired the classic hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful is up for sale.

And the generations of children who have sung about ‘the purple-headed mountain’ and ‘the river running by’ have actually been giving the rather spectacular particulars of Llanwenarth House.

Magnificent: The ivy-clad manor house in the Usk Valley near Abergavenny was the inspiration for the well-loved children's hymn

Stunning natural beauty: The 'purple-headed mountains' and 'river running by' refer to the beauty of the Usk Valley

Creatures great and small: Horses graze beside the river and drink from its calm waters

Cecil Alexander is believed to have written the lyrics while she was a guest at the 16th century manor, nestled in the Usk Valley in South Wales.

The ‘purple-headed mountain’ in one verse of the 1848 hymn is thought to refer to  the nearby Sugar Loaf and Blorenge peaks, while ‘the river running by’ in the next line is the River Usk which winds along the valley floor close to the estate’s boundary.

And the six acres of land it sits in would have offered plenty of space for the Irish poet to observe ‘each little flower that opens’ and ‘each little bird that sings’.

These days, however, the £2.25million seven-bedroom manor is simply advertised as having ‘stunning views’, along with rather more modern additions of a high-ceilinged cinema room, ornamental raised Jacuzzi bath and remote-controlled mood lighting.

Cecil Frances Alexander (nee  Humphreys) was a poet who also penned at least 400 hymns.

She
was born in Dublin in 1818, and spent much of her later life in 
Londonderry and Strabane with her husband, William Alexander, who became
Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.

Mrs
Alexander was a keen supporter of the Oxford Movement, and in 1848 
published Hymns For Little Children, which include three of the most 
popular hymns in the English language: All Things Bright and Beautiful, 
Once In Royal David's City and There Is A Green Hill Far Away.

The book was published in 69 editions and all the profits were given to Irish charities.

She died in 1895 and is buried in Londonderry.

The estate agent’s description of the former boutique hotel insists that ‘much of its character still remains’ but it ‘also embodies great comfort and ease of living’ in the village of Govilon, near Abergavenny.

Still, when Mrs Alexander wrote her famous verses she could never have imagined the home’s selling points would one day include its proximity to top golf courses, Michelin-starred restaurants and the M4 motorway.

It is also said to have an ‘exquisite interior’ and an ‘abundance of reception space’, and comes with Farrow and Ball décor, a detached coach house and an orchard.

With some poetic licence of their own, the vendor even describes how ‘chandeliers reflect in gleaming white marble floors’ and boasts of ‘polished black granite work surfaces and gold inlay’.

But Mrs Alexander, who also wrote Once in Royal David’s City, would no doubt be  comforted to know that the modernised house contains traditional wood panelling ‘in the style of Hampton Court’ and boasts ornate fireplaces.

The poet, who died in 1895 at the age of 77, was married to the Anglican Archbishop of Armagh, and included All Things Bright and Beautiful in her bestselling Hymns for Little Children.

The tome proved so popular that 69 editions were published in the 50 years after it was written.

It has been claimed that the hymn was
also inspired by countryside near Dunster in Somerset, and the poetry 
of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

The words in turn influenced the 
works of James Herriot, who used the ‘all creatures great and small’ 
line as the title of his books about the life of a vet in the Yorkshire 
Dales.

A spokesman for Cardiff estate agent 
Fine, which is marketing the property, said of its link to the famous 
hymn: ‘Not many houses have such a selling point.

‘But it is easy to see why Mrs Alexander was so inspired. The scenery surrounding the house is magnificent.’
