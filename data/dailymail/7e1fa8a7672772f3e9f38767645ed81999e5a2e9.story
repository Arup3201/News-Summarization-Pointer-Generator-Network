Like all members of his unit, Prince Harry wears the badge featuring his squadron's call sign with pride, after always wanting to be called an 'Ugly'.

And as the 28-year-old prince says, the unit's Go Ugly Early motto does indeed reflect the nature of the 662 Squadron (AAC), as it navigates the Â£45m Apache helicopters over war-ravaged Afghanistan.

But the motto might also be familiar with revellers out on the tiles up and down Britain's towns and cities every week, as it is often used by those 'on the pull'.

According to some, the term is used by 
those who have decided not to pursue the most attractive of potential 
partners while in a bar or a club, and instead settle for 'pulling' 
early on.

Cheeky motto: The 662 Squadron's 'Go Ugly Early' badge, worn by members of the unit including Prince Harry

'Ugly' job: The prince does not know the history of the motto, but describes the squadron as a 'pretty ugly beast'

To Prince Harry however, the 'Ugly' call sign of the 'very cool' Apaches he flew over Afghanistan on daily missions during his four-month tour of duty is a badge of honour.

He said: 'I don't know the story behind that, but I've always wanted to be an Ugly.'

Captain Wales, as he is known in the army, is no stranger to the firepower of the aircraft, after guiding them towards enemy locations during his first deployment in Helmand Province.

'Ever since I was a JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) back in 2009, whenever it was (2007-08), speaking to the Uglies was always the number one,' he said.

'Things have changed now. We've got no Harriers any more, the Tornados are working elsewhere, so this is the choice platform as far as we're concerned for the guys on the ground.

'I don't know where Ugly came from but it is a pretty ugly beast, and I think it's very cool.'

Like all members of his unit - 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps - Harry wears his 'Go Ugly Early' badge with pride.

The royal has his fixed to his flying helmet, alongside one with 'Harry Wales' stitched in yellow on to a black Stars and Stripes flag, and another of the classic Blue-Red-Blue flash of the Household Division.

From his seat in the front of the two-man cockpit, he is in charge of the weapons systems, which includes Hellfire missiles, rockets and a 30mm gun.

He said: 'It's a joy for me because I'm one of those people who loves playing PlayStation and Xbox, so with my thumbs I like to think that I'm probably quite useful.'

Downtime: The prince enjoys playing computer games with other members of his unit

The 662 Squadron became part of the 3 Regiment Army Air Corps in 1971, and was only designated an Attack Helicopter squadron in 2007 following the centralisation of aircraft types.

It was then that it was equipped with the Apache AH Mk1 battlefield helicopter.

The squadron formed during the Second World War on September 30, 1943, as the 662 (Air Observation Post) Squadron Royal Air Force, and was based at RAF Old Sarum, Wiltshire, equipped with the Auster Mk3 and, later, the Auster Mk4.

It went overseas to Normandy in June 1944 and was active throughout the rest of the campaign in North West Europe before it disbanded on December 15, 1945.

It was reformed on May 1, 1949 as the No 662 Royal Auxiliary Air Force Squadron, based at RAF Colerne.

The squadron was then disbanded again in March 1957, after comprising a number of detached flights, along with all RAuxAF flying squadrons.

It became part of the AAC in 1971 when they reformed as part of 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, in Soest, Germany. The regiment was then drawndown at the end of 1992.

It is currently located at Wattisham, in Suffolk.
