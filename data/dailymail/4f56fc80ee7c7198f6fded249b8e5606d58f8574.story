George Osborne yesterday welcomed investment in the UK by a controversial Chinese internet giant, despite warnings it could be spying on the West.

Speaking during a visit to China, the Chancellor brushed aside the security concerns over Huawei that have seen its operations limited or banned in the US, Australia and India.

Welcoming plans by the firm to build a £125 million research and development centre in Britain, Mr Osborne said: ‘There are some Western governments that have blocked Huawei from making investments. Not Britain. Quite the opposite.’

Earlier this year MPs warned that 
Huawei could be monitoring British internet users via the infrastructure
it provides to BT and O2.

A
Commons’ security committee warned that the Chinese government might be
able to ‘intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through 
Huawei-supplied networks’.

And
last year a US Congressional committee called for American companies 
not to do business with the firm because it posed a threat to national 
security.

Huawei, which was 
founded by a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army, has long 
been accused of close links with the Chinese military and government.

It
operates a cyber-security centre in Oxfordshire to check its equipment 
for security threats – but it is staffed by its own employees.

Ties: Huawei has announced that it will invest an additional £125million in Britain

Fears: Huawei has been accused of helping China spy on internet traffic via joint ventures in the West

MPs
have called for GCHQ to take over the centre, which is now being 
investigated. Last year Major General Jonathan Shaw, a former 
cyber-security expert at the Ministry of Defence, said that Britain was 
‘dealing with the devil’ in allowing Huawei access to its electronic 
infrastructure.

A Treasury 
source insisted the Government was happy with Huawei’s operations in the
UK, as were other countries such as Germany and Sweden. The source said
the firm met ‘clear and stringent security rules’.

During
a visit to the firm’s headquarters in Shenzhen, Mr Osborne described it
as a ‘great hi-tech company’. He praised the ‘huge opportunity’ 
presented by the rise of Chinese technology firms, pointing to gaming 
company Rekoo’s decision to open an office in London’s Tech City.

‘Huawei
and Rekoo’s investment into the UK is a great testament to Britain’s 
tech industry and I am here to make sure that relationship goes from 
strength to strength,’ he said.

Huawei has repeatedly denied engaging in espionage and describes itself as a ‘globally trusted’.

Chief
executive Ren Zhengfei said the firm was attracted by the ‘open and 
free-trade economy’ in the UK, which has ‘some of the best hi-tech 
professionals in the world’.

London
Mayor Boris Johnson, who is also on a trade mission to China, yesterday
said British children should be taught Mandarin in schools.

The Tory, who is studying the language, said it would ensure children grew up with an understanding of the country’s importance.
