Doctor Who's assistant Clara Oswald is in for a rude awakening when she’s teamed up with new Time Lord Peter Capaldi.

In the last series she had the Doctor – as played by Matt Smith – under her thumb.

But that’s all set to change now that The Thick Of It’s Capaldi has taken over as the Doctor.

Off kilter: Jenna Coleman with new Doctor Peter Capaldi

Steven Moffat, writer and producer of the BBC1 series, says the new Doctor will ‘bare his fangs’ as Clara’s world is turned upside town with the arrival of an older and ‘ruder’ Time Lord to replace his lovestruck predecessor.

‘The most interesting thing is what the change of Doctor does to Clara,’ he says. ‘Matt Smith’s Doctor was “Look at me, I am cool because look at who I get to hang out with”. He was like a puppy waiting to roll over and have his stomach tickled.

‘Clara was the control freak who had the controllable Doctor. It was a stable relationship and they were a lovely couple. But now the Doctor grows his fangs back and she thinks, bloody hell, that is hard.’

Moffat says the pair would become friends in time but the new version of the Doctor was not an easy man to pin down.

Sudden change: Coleman said her character, Clara Oswald, is faced with an unprecedented challenge by the new Doctor - who will insist he is not her 'boyfriend'

‘He is more uncontrollable, way less predictable.’

Capaldi’s Doctor – who makes his debut in a feature-length episode set in Victorian London shown on BBC1 on Saturday, August 23 – wastes no time in trying to put Oswald, played by Jenna Coleman, in her place.

He struggles to remember who she is after his regeneration and asks if she is the one who asks a lot of questions. He refers to her as a control freak and puts her life in danger.

His distinctively Scottish Time Lord also leaves her in no doubt that, contrary to what they may have thought in the past, he is not her ‘boyfriend’.

Capaldi, 56, is best known for his foul-mouthed spin doctor Malcolm Tucker in the political sitcom The Thick Of It.

Coleman, 28, said: ‘Peter’s casting has thrown everything off kilter, especially for Clara. Suddenly she is faced with this man that she can’t figure out or control.’
