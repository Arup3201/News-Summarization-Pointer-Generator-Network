Mason Tipping was fond of climbing on furniture his parents say. The 22-month-old was crushed by a chest of drawers.

The devastated parents of a toddler killed when a chest of drawers fell on him have spoken of their heartbreak.

Mason Tipping, aged 22 months, was climbing up on his bedroom furniture when it toppled and fell on him at his home in Colchester, Essex.

Mason's father Adrian, 29, rushed to his son's aid, lifting the chest of drawers before desperately attempting first aid.

The toddler was rushed by ambulance to Colchester General Hospital but despite the continued efforts of medical staff, he was declared dead about 25 minutes after arrival.

Mason was found by his mother, Christine Tauchert, 22, when she went to get him ready for breakfast at 9am on Friday morning.

Speaking at their home Mr Tipping, said: 'Usually we can hear the children playing from about six in the morning, but it was strangely quiet.

'Christine went into his room and I heard her scream. She was desperately trying to lift the chest of drawers off him, but it must have weighed at least 30kg because it was full of his clothes.

'I was doing mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions, hoping for the best. He was looking up at me and his eyes were open but in my heart I think I knew he was dead.'

Mason was rushed to Colchester General Hospital where a  team of medics was waiting for his arrival.

Mr Tipping said: 'At that stage we were still hoping they would hand him back to us and say "he is okay", but the doctor came across and said "sorry, there is nothing we can do."'

Having seen Mason use the chest of drawers like a ladder to climb up to get his teddies on the shelf above, Mr Tipping removed the bottom two drawers and screwed the draw fronts in as fascias.

But he now fears his efforts to 
prevent danger, could have tragically left the chest of drawers 
top-heavy, causing them to topple over. The drawers were about 3.5ft tall and made of pine-effect PVC.

'That's why the drawers had been 
fastened shut but we think he may have pulled out the third draw up and 
fallen head first into the gap.

'It keeps running through my mind that what I did caused the drawers to fall, it is a horrible feeling.'

The couple have created a shrine in Mason's bedroom and it is now covered in bouquets of flowers and Mason's teddy bears.

They have two other children, Keira, 
two, and Faye, four months, and are hoping to warn other parents to look
out for hidden and unexpected dangers around their homes.

Miss Tauchert, who is a carer, said: 
'He was so loving to his sisters. Even though he was not the oldest, he 
was like the big brother and would not have stood for any trouble when 
they started going to school.'

The family have been told they cannot
hold a funeral for their little boy until an inquest into the death has
been completed by the Essex Coroner's Office.

The Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents (RoSPA) says that accidents are the major cause of death 
for children up to 15 years old.

A million children attend casualty 
departments every year due to home accidents throughout the UK and 0-4 years age are the most at risk group, claim 
RoSPA's.

Sheila Merrill, public health adviser
for RoSPA, said: 'The most normal household objects like a wooden 
wardrobe, heavy furniture or even a television can be a risk to the 
young as these objects can easily topple on top of them.She said that for heavy furniture parents should think about fixing it to a wall with safety restraints or fixing straps.

A shrine to Mason has now been set up in his bedroom.

It includes pictures of him, his baby 
book, flowers, candles and a poem pinned to the wall that was compiled 
by his parents hours after he died.

It reads:

If tears could build a stairway,And memories a lane,I’d walk right to heaven,And bring you home again,No farewell words were spoken,No time to say goodbye,You were gone before I knew it,And God only knows why.My heart still aches in sadness,And secret tears still flow,What it meant to lose you.No one will ever know.

Forever,All our love,Mummy and Daddy
