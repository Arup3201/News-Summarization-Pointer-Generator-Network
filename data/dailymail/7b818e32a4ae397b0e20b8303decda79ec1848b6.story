A black ice hockey player racially abused on Twitter by fans after scoring a stunning series-winning overtime goal has said the comments were 'shocking to see, but didn't ruin my day'.

Washington Capitals forward Joel Ward, 31, was called a n***** and f***** on the site after his sensational shot eliminated the Boston Bruins in the dying moments of yesterday's game.

But he has refused to let the slurs, dubbed 'ignorant and unacceptable' by the NHL and the Bruins, to mar his moment of glory.

Scroll down for footage of the goal...

Ecstatic: But Joel Ward shrugged off the racist remarks by saying the posters were 'just kids'

Disgusting: Ward was abused on Twitter by fans after scoring a stunning series-winning overtime goal has said the comments were 'shocking to see, but didn't ruin my day'

'It doesn't faze me at all. We won, and we are moving on. People are going to say what they want to say,' he told USA TODAY Sports.

Angry Boston fans also told Ward, who has played in the NHL for four years, to 'go play basketball, hockey is a white sport'.

They also typed '4th line black trash' and 'white power', while another said the fact a black player scored 'makes this loss hurt a lot more'.

Anson Carter, a black winger who played for four seasons for the Bruins during a 10-year NHL career, said he was 'very surprised' by the reaction.

Shutting them up: Ward scored just six goals all year before he slammed home a rebound at 2:57 of overtime to give the Capitals a 2-1 victory

He said: 'I thought we were beyond that. But then again, nothing surprises me. I know racism exists but if people think all NHL fans are racist, that's the furthest thing from the truth.'

He called Ward's goal, which propelled the Capitals into the second round, one of the biggest NHL moments ever for a black player, rivalled only by Jarome Iginla's exploits for the Calgary Flames.

Ward scored just six goals all year before he slammed home a rebound at 2:57 of overtime to give the Capitals a 2-1 victory.

The reaction to Ward's goal 'sets the league back in terms of perception,' Carter said.

He added: 'The league has come a long way. To the casual fan, people may have in the back of their minds that it's a racist sport, and this validates that idea.'

Ward called the tweets 'shocking' but brushed them off, saying that he wasn't even aware of them until a teammate brought them to his attention on the plane ride back to Washington.

'It doesn't faze me at all,' he said, adding he had never experienced any racism in the NHL, only a few remarks at youth tournaments when he was growing up in Canada.

Idiotic: There have been a few racial incidents over the years, including a banana thrown at the Philadelphia Flyers' Wayne Simmonds in a preseason game last autumn

Momentous: The goal has been billed as one of the biggest NHL moments ever for a black player, rivalled only by Jarome Iginla's exploits for the Calgary Flames

He added: 'I think it is just kids. It has no effect on me whatsoever. I've been playing this game long enough and I've not had any encounters of that nature.'

He said he has always felt comfortable in an NHL dressing room and on the ice: 'There is no lying about it. …I'm definitely the one black guy in a room with 20 white guys.

'There are definitely some cultural differences, such as taste in music, but I've never heard anything derogatory.'

And he says he has no concern about his safety moving forward in the playoffs: 'I'm pretty laid-back and I get along with a lot of people.

'I don't fear anything like that, and I have a good group of guys to protect me.'

Willie O'Ree was the league's first black player, breaking into the Bruins' lineup in 1958, and there are now 28 blacks and a total of 68 non-whites in a league of 876 players.

There have been a few racial incidents over the years, including a banana thrown at the Philadelphia Flyers' Wayne Simmonds in a preseason game last autumn.

'It's disgusting,' Simmonds said yesterday about the reaction to Ward's goal.

'Things like that have happened to me before. It's not something you want to happen, but it's sad in this day and age that it continues to happen.'

The NHL said in a statement that the tweets were, 'ignorant and unacceptable. The people responsible for these comments have no place associating themselves with our game'.

And Capitals owner Ted Leonsis posted on his blog: 'Shame on these folks who decided to take to their keyboards and show their ignorance and their racism and hate.'
