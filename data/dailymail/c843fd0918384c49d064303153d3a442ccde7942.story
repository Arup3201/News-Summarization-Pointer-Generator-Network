A mother suffered a fatal heart attack after learning her baby had died in the womb, an inquest has heard.

Her grieving husband Darren, 41, said he was convinced she had died of a broken heart after learning that their first child was dead.

Lindsay Clift, 29, collapsed in a hospital delivery suite on September 26 last year.

The couple had wanted to start a family since they met seven years ago. They discovered they were expecting their first child after marrying in May 2011

She had been admitted because her baby still hadn’t arrived 12 days after the due date.

Doctors planned to induce labour, but
found the baby, who the couple had already named Katy May, had died and
Mrs Clift would have to go through a stillbirth. Her husband said: 
‘There was no reason to think anything was going to go wrong that day. 
She walked in there fit and healthy.

‘In my view she was so heartbroken 
that she wanted to be with the baby.  This was a longed-for baby, it was
mine and Lindsay’s first.’

The couple's daughter was 12 days overdue. When they induced Mrs Clift they discovered Katy May had died in the womb and Mrs Clift was forced to give birth to her stillborn

An inquest heard that Mrs Clift died of an amniotic fluid embolism - a rare condition affecting one in 200,000 mothers in the UK - which triggered a fatal heart attack

On Thursday Mr Clift, who lived with his wife in Bilston, West Midlands, broke down in tears at her inquest.

His wife, a hairdresser, died of an 
amniotic fluid embolism – a rare condition affecting one in 200,000 
mothers in the UK – which triggered a fatal heart attack, the inquest in
Smethwick, West Midlands, heard. Pathologist Dr Adrian Yoong said he 
found skin cells and a fragment of hair in Mrs Clift’s lungs.

He said: ‘Sometimes material comes 
off the baby into the blood, including skin cells and so on. The only 
source could have been the amniotic fluid.

Speaking after his wife's death last year, Mr Clift described her as 'beautiful, stunning and warm' and said she died of a 'broken heart'

Mrs Clift died at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton on September 26 last year after staff battled to save her

Mr Clift praised the hospital, saying staff had done everything they could

‘We can say fairly surely that the finding in the lung suggests not only an embolism, but that it was the cause of death.’

But Mr Clift has said he feels a 
broken heart played a part in his wife’s death. Shortly after the  
tragedy, he said: ‘For them not to find an instant cause of death, it 
sort of strengthens my feeling, even if it’s medically nonsense, that 
she made the decision to go.

‘I still can’t believe how we got to this. The hospital were brilliant, they did everything they could.’
Mrs Clift, who married in May 2011, was brought to New Cross Hospital in
Wolverhampton to be induced 41 weeks and five days into her pregnancy.

A midwife raised the alarm after failing to find a heartbeat, and an ultrasound scan confirmed Katy May was dead.
Consultant obstetrician Dr David Churchill described how, as he  
prepared for the urgent procedure, Mrs Clift collapsed, struggling to 
breathe. He said: ‘It was clear that she had had a cardiac arrest.’

She died hours later. Black  Country 
coroner Robin Balmain said the death was down to natural causes, adding:
‘This is a tragedy for everybody. Mrs Clift would no doubt have been 
anticipating a very exciting time. It was going to be her first child.’

An amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but serious condition that occurs
when amniotic fluid — the fluid that surrounds a baby in the uterus 
during pregnancy — or foetal material, such as hair, enters the maternal 
bloodstream.

Why an amniotic fluid embolism occurs isn't well understood. It's possible the fluid or foetal material 
enters the maternal bloodstream, possibly by passing through tears in 
the fetal membranes. It's likely that amniotic fluid contains components
that cause an inflammatory reaction and activate clotting in the 
mother's lungs and blood vessels.

However, amniotic fluid embolisms are rare - and it's likely that some 
amniotic fluid commonly enters the maternal bloodstream during delivery 
without causing problems. It's not clear why in some cases this leads to
an amniotic fluid embolism.
