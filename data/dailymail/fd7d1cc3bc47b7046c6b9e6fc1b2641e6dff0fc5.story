Jamie Redknapp believes it would have been a 'travesty' had Liverpool lost against Arsenal at Anfield, having dominated for large spells of Sunday's encounter.

After missing several chances at Old Trafford in their defeat to Manchester United last time out, Liverpool were again guilty of profligacy in front of goal against the Gunners at Anfield, with 27 shots yielding just two goals.

However, after going down to ten men following substitute Fabio Borini's dismissal, there are certainly plenty of positives to take out of the 2-2 draw, and Redknapp thinks things are looking up for Brendan Rodgers' men.

Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp felt Liverpool were magnificent against Arsenal on Sunday 

Lucas Leiva had one of several Liverpool attempts which failed to find the net at Anfield on Suday

'Liverpool certainly didn’t deserve to lose today,' Redknapp told Sky Sports.

'It would have been a travesty if Liverpool would have lost that game. They were magnificent.

'They have been battered at times this season. They’ve conceded too many goals and not been at their best for a while.

'If you are looking for positives, today is as good as it gets for Liverpool.

Martin Skrtel's late header rescued Liverpool, but Jamie Redknapp was pleased with what he saw

'I know they only drew 2-2, but the manner with which they passed the ball they can only get better with Sturridge to come back.

'Going forward has been a problem, as well as at the back this season, but some of the movement was a joy to watch at times.

'How they got themselves into a position to lose that match, with the amount of chances and possession that they had I do not know.

'That have to sort it out defensively, yes, but if they keep passing like that things will improve.

Former Liverpool striker Craig Bellamy backed Redknapp's claims that the Reds are certainly improving, and reserved special praise for two of the creators in Rodgers' line-up. 

Craig Bellamy was full of praise for Philippe Coutinho's movement and pace in attack against Arsenal

Adam Lallana's performance was also praised as he begins to find his feet at Liverpool

"I agree that Liverpool are much better," Bellamy added.

'I thought the performance against Man United was very good. Then Bournemouth and now today. 

'They are looking more of a threat that’s for sure.

'(Philippe) Coutinho was brilliant today, and we are now seeing the best of (Adam) Lallana.

'He has found a position and we are seeing what he did at Southampton.

'All Coutinho needs is half a yard, he is that quick off the mark.'
