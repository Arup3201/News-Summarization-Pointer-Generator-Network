A Florida woman has revealed that she spent nearly a year eating free rotisserie chickens from area Publix grocery stores by taking advantage of a store policy promising all sales be priced as advertised or taken off the bill.

Janet Feldman, a 57-year-old who designs stripper costumes, first demanded the so-called 'Publix promise' after realizing many of the stores birds didn't meet the listed 2-pound minimum weight.

A year and 300 free chickens later, the Davie woman portrays herself as a sort of Robin Hood of poultry.

Chicken lady: Janet Feldman of Davie, Florida discovered the Publix was selling underweight chickens about a year ago and his been taking advantage of their 'Publix Promise' to refund all money paid for for items for which the scanned price doesn't match the posted price--in this case, 'two-pound' birds for $7.59 weren't meeting the minimum weight

Major haul: Feldman's biggest haul came during a recent trip to 11 Broward County Publix stores in which she managed to get 47 free chickens

'When I see a wrong,' she told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. 'I right the wrong.'

But Feldman never had to steal from anyone and gave most of meat, not to the poor, but to homeless dogs and cats she works with at local rescue organizations.

Feldman's oddball hobby began one day as she shopped at a Publix and noticed some scrawny chickens.

She actually weighed one over in the produce department and found it was under the two-pound minimum.

She checked out, but thought better of it. She took the issue to the manager and was promptly refunded her $7.59.

When Feldman tried her trick again, it worked just the same. It also worked every time thereafter.

All 300 times. And it only got easier.

'I could do it blindfolded,' she told the Tampa Bay Times.

Eventually, Feldman says the thrill of the hunt turned to concern as she realized some of the people buying the underweight chickens sold as two-pounders could be poor and that they were therefor taken advantage of.

To right the wrong, Feldman made up her mind to take her biggest haul ever.

She went out into the shopping plaza-filled stretches of Broward County and hit up 11 Publix stores for a grand total of  47 chickens.

She then took her story, and the mouth-watering evidence, to the Sun-Sentinel.

'Publix delis have been informed to weigh rotisserie chickens that seem underweight and price them appropriately, or use those chickens in other deli recipes,' Publix spokeswoman Nicole Krauss told the Sun-Sentinel in response.

According to Krauss, Publix chicken suppliers were sending them underweight birds because of a terribly cold winter and the resulting puny poultry.

Thanks to Feldman, Publix has now promised to rectify the issue.

'You can’t ever stay silent,' she said. 'Everybody’s got to speak up, even if it’s about chickens.'
