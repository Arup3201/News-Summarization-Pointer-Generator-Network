Sergio Ramos powered in one of the most important headed goals in history on Saturday night - the Real Madrid central defender storming from deep to force extra time in the Champions League final they eventually won.

Its timing - the third minute of added time in a game Real looked destined to lose - was poetic and added to the occasion's drama.

Here, Sportsmail celebrates some of the best headers ever.

Have that! Sergio Ramos got Real Madrid back in the game against Atletico in the Champions League final

Luis Suarez (Liverpool)

There wasn't much Suarez couldn't do for Brendan Rodgers' side last season, and he even managed to score a ridiculous header from the edge of the box against West Brom in October.

The Uruguayan got on the end of a shallow cross, yanked his neck and thundered the ball past Boaz Myhill.

Didier Drogba (Chelsea)

Similarly to Ramos' strike on Saturday, Drogba etched his name into European folklore by equalising for Chelsea in the 88th minute of their Champions League final against Bayern Munich in 2012. A real striker's goal at the near post.

Henrik Larsson (Sweden)

Only Zlatan Ibrahimovic can lay claim to being up there with Larsson in a Sweden shirt, with the ex-Celtic and Barcelona man one of the most lethal forwards in world football in his day.

One of Larsson's best came in the 5-0 mauling of Bulgaria at Euro 2004. He latched on to an Erik Edman cross with a full-length dive to divert past the goalkeeper.

Luis Garcia (Liverpool)

The Kop end at Anfield on European nights is a strange place; it seems to suck some of the most breathtaking goals to grace the stadium, with Garcia's effort against Anderlecht in 2005 no different.

Running from deep, the Spaniard simply spun his neck to whip a header beyond a helpless Sylvio Proto. The Reds went on to comfortably beat the Belgians 3-0.

Richard Walker (Blackpool)

Added time of a game Division Three Blackpool really needed to win in 2001, and substitute Walker came from absolutely nowhere to bullet a late, late winner in from Tommy Jaszczun's desperate centre.

Incidentally, a certain Mark Clattenburg was the referee that night and the Seasiders won promotion via the play-offs.

Jared Borgetti (Mexico)

Although in the eyes of some English football fans his career was tainted by a difficult spell at Bolton, Borgetti was one of the more inventive finishers in world football. The Mexican's crowning moment was perhaps a cute header against Italy at the 2002 World Cup. One for the purists.

Luca Toni (Juventus)

There looked very little on when a floated cross found its way towards the Cagliari area, but Toni had other ideas.

The big Italian got in between two defenders and used all of his neck power to drill a header home.

Keith Houchen (Coventry City)

This may be one of the only things Houchen is remembered for, but it's not a bad one. An FA Cup final goal, and a diving header at that.

He notched a second equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur on the day in 1987 at Wembley, with the Sky Blues going on to win 3-2.

Allan Clarke (Leeds United)

The
 winner in a Cup final isn't half bad, but when it's a diving header in 
the competition's centenary year against Arsenal it's bloody brilliant.

Clarke took flight on the edge of the box with the execution spectacular.

Javier Hernandez (Manchester United)

A
 real improvised effort away at Stoke City, Hernandez twisted and turned 
in the six-yard box to give himself enough purchase to lever into the 
net.
