Bayern Munich might have thrashed Roma 7-1 in the Champions League but their coach Pep Guardiola still wasn't satisfied on Tuesday night. 

The German title holders celebrated their win with a private audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Wednesday morning but Guardiola insisted his side could still improve and that mistakes had been made in the Stadio Olimpico demolition.

And all this despite Pope Francis apparently telling a Bayern delegation they had played 'a wonderful game' and admitted his 'surprise' at the margin of victory.

Guardiola told Sky Sports Italia: 'We have a few things to improve and one of them is that we gave Roma too many chances at the start of the second half.' 

Bayern scored five times in the opening 35 minutes on their way to a record away win in Europe that left them top of Group E with maximum points.

'This game is an exception, an incident,' Guardiola acknowledged. 'It's not the difference between the two teams, we will see that in two weeks.

'We got a quick goal and that relaxed us, then we got another. Roma are a team who always play well, but we were very aggressive, made the right decisions and found space.'

Bayern took a ninth-minute lead through Arjen Robben before strikes from Mario Gotze, Robert Lewandowski and Robben again put them 4-0 up by the half-hour.

A Thomas Muller penalty extended the lead and, after Gervinho pulled one back, late goals from Franck Ribery and Xherdan Shaqiri completed the rout. 

Ashley Cole had a particularly chastening night and was taken off at half-time after being terrorised by former Chelsea team-mate Arjen Robben.

Guardiola's opposite number Rudi Garcia took responsibility for the disaster.

Rudi Garcia has taken responsibility, admitting that he made a mistake with the Roma's strategy

'It was a technical collapse, not a mental one,' said the Frenchman, whose last match against Bayern ended in a 6-1 defeat when he was coach of French club Lille two seasons ago.

'The first person to make a mistake was myself. I got the strategy wrong. In the second half, we showed some pride and would have scored more goals if it hadn't been for their goalkeeper.

'Bayern have showed that they are stronger than us. We were spectators at the match, we should have been more aggressive and compact.

'We need to accept this defeat which shows how far we have to go to get close to the world's best teams. We can still qualify from this group, but not playing like this.'

Midfielder Daniele De Rossi said the difference between the sides was not as big as the scoreline suggested.

'It's a stab in the heart, the city and ourselves had waited so much for this game,' he said. 'There was a technical imbalance, they are stronger than us. But I don't think the difference is as big as the scoreline suggests.

'This defeat can be a lesson for the future and shows us that there is a long road ahead. We got a bit demoralised because all they did worked and nothing came off for us.'

Goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis added: 'The only positive thing about this evening has been the behaviour of our fans. This was an unjustifiable defeat. We all take the responsibility.'
