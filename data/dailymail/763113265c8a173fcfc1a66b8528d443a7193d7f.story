The 12-year-old central Arkansas girl who was stricken by a rare brain infection has returned to the water park that was the source of her illness.

Kali Hardig went to Willow Springs Water Park Monday to promote a benefit fishing tournament the park is holding later this month.

She became ill in July, and the type of infection she had is nearly always fatal. The park has been closed since Kali was sickened by a water-borne amoeba. Owners David and Lou Ann Ratliff say they'll use the pond for fishing, and other space to store boats and campers.

Kali's mother, Traci Hardig, says the Ratliffs have been supportive.

'There are no hard feelings," said Traci Hardig.

'They [the water park owners] are just a family, just like us. This is their livelihood. It's OK to come out here. It's OK to support them.'

Kali is the third person in the US to survive the parasite.

She contracted the killer infection at a water park in Arkansas and had been fighting for her life since July 19.

'I was real sick, momma wouldn't leave the hospital at all. Momma was scared to leave me, she told me', Kali said.

And
now that the youngster is back to full health, she is looking forward 
to the future and said she wants to grow up to be a hair stylist.

'I plan to become a hair stylist and do hair. Yup, that's my dream.'

Kali
was diagnosed with the harrowing form of meningitis caused by an amoeba
called Naegleria fowleri, which expects believe swam into her body from
warm, shallow water at a water park.

who contract the parasitic infection rarely survive, so it's remarkable
that Kali is alive, let alone able to say anything.

There were only 128 such infections 
reported in the United States between 1962 and 2012, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Her family has been updating her followers with news on a Prayers for Kali Le Ann Facebook page and posted an image of her out with her friends for dinner at the steak house.

They
have also shared photos of people from across the world who have thrown
fundraisers for Kali. One group image shows scores of U.S. soldiers in 
Kuwait holding signs of support.

Health officials believe Kali got sick after a trip to a now-shuttered Arkansas water park that features a sandy-bottomed lake.

Naegleria
fowleri (pronounced nuh-GLEER'-ee-uh FOW'-lur-ee) often is found in 
warm bodies of freshwater, such as lakes, rivers and hot springs.

The amoeba typically enters the body through the nose as people are swimming or diving.

Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific.

It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their noses.

The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees.

The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans.

Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years.

Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico

Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by keeping their heads above water; using nose clips or holding the nose shut when the head is submerged; avoid stirring up sediment in shallow areas.

It can then travel to the brain, causing a devastating infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM. That's what Kali has been battling.

Initial symptoms usually start within one to seven days and may include headache, fever, nausea and vomiting.

The disease progresses rapidly, and other symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations.

Moreover, the infection destroys brain tissue and can cause brain swelling and death. Doctors say Kali's success is due in large part to experimental treatment and early detection and diagnosis.

Traci Hardig brought Kali to Arkansas Children's Hospital with a nasty fever on July 19 - and doctors have credited this fast thinking with her daughter's miraculous recovery.

Doctors cooled Kali's body down to try to reduce the swelling, and they won clearance to treat her with a breast-cancer drug. Now, tests show no sign of the parasite in her system.

'It's
still a concern that she could certainly have some deficits long-term 
and not function entirely as she would have if this had never happened,'
one of her doctors, Dr. Vikki Stefans, said.

Rare: The U.S. has recorded just 130 cases of Naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years
