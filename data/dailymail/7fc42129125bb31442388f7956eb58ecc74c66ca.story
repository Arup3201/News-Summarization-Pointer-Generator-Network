Under investigation: Former France Telecom chief executive Didier Lombard was questioned yesterday

The former chief of France Telecom was yesterday put under investigation over his alleged role in a wave of suicides by staff.

Didier Lombard was head of the telecoms company when when more than 30 employees committed suicide in 2008 and 2009, a decade after its privatisation.

Following a complaint from trade unions, he has now been accused of advocating management practices that were so tough they amounted to psychological harassment, his lawyer said yesterday.

He was released under court surveillance on bail of 100,000 euros (Â£80,000) after being questioned for four hours by two investigating magistrates.

Lombard stepped down as France Telecom CEO in early 2010 amid criticism of his handling of the crisis. The company had suspended its restructuring plans the year before amid an outcry.

Yesterday he issued a statement in the prominent French national newspaper Le Monde proclaiming his innocence.

'I forcefully reject the idea that (restructuring) plans vital to the survival of the company might have been the cause of human tragedies,' he said.

The former CEO added: 't no point were these plans conceived and put in place by France Telecom directed against employees.

'They were meant to save the company and its employees, and to open up new career paths in the new digital world.'

Lombard's lawyer, Jean Veil, said his client had not been given a chance to explain himself fully.

Mr Veil said Lombard sought to clarify the context of his actions by referring to tough economic conditions and pressure exerted by the government, a minority stakeholder.

Unions said harsh practices including forced moves and impossible performance targets were partly behind the rash of suicides.

Many of France Telecom's workers had protected status making it difficult to fire them. The company instead gave them meaningless jobs to force them out, driving some to suicide, unions said.

France Telecom had countered by saying the suicide rate was no higher than in the general population. Nevertheless, many of those who killed themselves left notes blaming work pressures, the BBC reported.

Yet the former CEO, who was succeeded by Stephane Richard, said after stepping down that he regretted not taking measures earlier than he had to boost staff morale at the company, which employs 100,000.

In February 2010, government labour inspectors wrote in a report on the suicides that France Telecom had ignored warnings from doctors about the mental health of certain employees.

The report, seen by Reuters, pointed to a restructuring plan that sought to reduce headcount by 22,000 and put 10,000 other workers in new positions as having a 'pathological effect' on staff morale.

'In this case, Mr Didier Lombard is being accused of harassment against people that he never met,' Mr Veil said. 'That is a stunning accusation.'

If found guilty of harassment, Lombard could face up to one year in prison and a 15,000-euro fine. Two other former senior executives at France Telecom have been summoned by investigating magistrates.
