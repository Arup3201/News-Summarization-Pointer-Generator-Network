Britain has begun arming the Kurds to fight back against ISIS, David Cameron revealed today.

The Prime Minister told MPs, in a statement following last week’s Nato summit in Newport, that Britain ‘will continue to support the Kurds, including by providing them with arms and training their troops’.

Until now the Government has limited itself to transporting weapons from former Soviet countries to the Kurds, for example from Albania.

But Mr Cameron was asked if Britain will now be providing the Kurdish peshmerga militia directly with arms. The Prime Minister responded: ‘The short answer to that is yes.’ Britain has also offered to train the Kurdish fighters.

The PM told MPs that he hoped the new Iraqi government would be formed later this week. Airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq will not be given the go-ahead until a new Iraqi government has been formed.

Mr Cameron said Nato ‘was clear about the threat from Islamist extremism’.

He said: ‘We agreed we must use all the instruments at our disposal - humanitarian, diplomatic and military - to squeeze this barbaric terrorist organisation out of existence.’

Mr Cameron also said Russia would be hit with fresh sanctions today over its military incursion into Ukraine.

He said: ‘Nato sent a clear message to Russia that what President Putin is doing is illegal and indefensible. We stand firmly behind Ukraine's right to make its own decisions not to have them dictated by Russian soldiers trampling on Ukraine's sovereign soil.

‘We will continue our efforts to support Ukraine, including by providing financial assistance to improve their command, control and communication capabilities.

‘Today's new sanctions from the European Union will further ramp up the economic cost to Russia.

‘They will make it harder for its banks and its energy and defence companies to borrow money, they will widen the ban on selling so-called dual goods like machinery and computer equipment that could be used for military or civilian purposes.’

The Prime Minister outlined agreements on a new rapid reaction force, exercises in eastern Europe and spending commitments from Nato members.

Mr Cameron said Nato members that were not meeting the obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defence had agreed to halt cuts in spending and increase it in real terms over the next decade.

And he said new equipment would also be purchased - highlighting Britain's own decisions to invest in the ‘best and most modern military hardware money can buy’.

The Prime Minister added: ‘After the end of the Cold War, Nato stood down its highest readiness force. At this summit we decided to reverse that decision and scale up our readiness to respond to any threat.

‘A new multinational spearhead force will be formed and will be deployable anywhere in the world within two to five days - this is vital in underlining our article five obligations to collective defence, and the UK will support this by providing a brigade and battle headquarters.’

Replying to the statement, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘This Nato summit was the most important for a generation.

‘Today, Nato faces the gravest challenges in Europe, the Middle East and beyond since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the first Gulf War.

‘I commend Nato leaders for seizing the opportunity to put down firm markers on the key issues - Russia and Ukraine, Isil, and defence co-operation.’

Mr Miliband stressed the importance of Nato's defence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from potential Russian aggression.

He said: ‘This summit demonstrated that the Nato alliance is strong and it is needed by its member states more than ever.

‘As president Obama has said, the defence of Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius is just as important as the defence of Berlin and Paris and London.

‘The task for Nato is to demonstrate this commitment and an understanding that wherever our interests lie, we need a strategy which combines military readiness with political, diplomatic, and strategic alliances.

‘We join the Government in supporting a Nato that meets that challenge.’
