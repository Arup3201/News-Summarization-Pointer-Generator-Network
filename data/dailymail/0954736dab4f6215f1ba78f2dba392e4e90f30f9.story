When Cesc Fabregas claims he is playing the best football of his life, it is worth pausing to place it in context.

This is Fabregas, the star of an attractive Arsenal side who passed and moved to the Champions League final, a Catalan who spent three years with Lionel Messi and Co at Barcelona and who conquered the world with Spain in 2010.

And, yet, in four months at Chelsea he already seems like he was born to be Jose Mourinho’s tempo-setter in a team committed to entertain and hell-bent on winning.

‘I feel in control and that’s what I like the most in football,’ said Fabregas. ‘I touch the ball all the time, I feel happy, I go and get the ball from here, from there, I can go forward, Oscar drops deep. I feel free, I feel confident.

‘Sometimes in the last three or four years in the national team and Barcelona, I was playing like a No 9. I mean, I have to do it for the team and I enjoy it, and it’s all good. But, here, where I am playing today, in these games, it’s where I enjoy my football the most. I feel right now I am playing some of the best football of my career.

‘I’ve played in World Cup finals, European Championship finals, Champions League finals with great teams. I’m not saying the (last two) games against West Brom or Schalke were the best, probably they weren’t, but definitely they were games I enjoyed a lot.’

Then the inner Mourinho kicks in. Fabregas has a winning mentality, a touch of devilment, perhaps a selfish streak, which is sure to appeal to his latest manager.

‘I didn’t just come here to play well and that’s it,’ he said. ‘I came to win trophies. If I can play well and enjoy myself, the better.

‘We have to win trophies. No-one remembers a great, great team if you don’t. We have to win and that will say a lot from us and people will judge it how they want to judge it. The most important thing is to keep it going and at the end of the season we can talk.’

Fabregas has yet to lose a game with Chelsea. They are clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League, safely into the last 16 of the Champions League and are Capital One Cup quarter-finalists.

Mourinho’s team have barely offered a glimpse of weakness, from swatting aside Burnley on the opening day to the destruction of Schalke in Germany on Tuesday.

Who can beat them? How many trophies can they collect this year?

It is difficult to see who might stop them, but Fabregas said: ‘We go on by not agreeing with the assumption. We know people say how great Chelsea is, how good they are playing, how we have won the title, but it is just not happening this way in the dressing room.

‘It’s a long way to go, especially with the Christmas period. We will play Southampton and Tottenham away, you can drop points. Why not? It can happen.

‘This is the toughest league in the world. Everyone else is having holidays, as I did in the last three years. Trust me, it helps a lot.

‘It is not the same going into the Champions League knockout stages after 10 days on holiday in Dubai as it is playing every two or three days in the Premier League. We will have to cope with it. I believe we have the squad to cope with it, 100 per cent, no excuses.’

Fabregas and Diego Costa stirred controversy in Spain when they pulled out of international duty only to both be fit for Chelsea’s 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.

It prompted questions about commitment from some quarters, including Sergio Ramos. Fabregas called the Real Madrid defender to set the record straight.

‘I have played 94 games for Spain,’ said the 27-year-old Chelsea midfielder.

‘I’ve been going for nine years, always, and with a big smile. We spoke on the phone. I told him we have played together since Under 21s and there is no need for him to send messages through the press. I told him to call me up and say it to my face. Everything is fine.’
