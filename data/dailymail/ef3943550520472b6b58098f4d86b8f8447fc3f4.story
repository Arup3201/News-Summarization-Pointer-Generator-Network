Luis Suarez appearing to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup shocked the football community and will certainly live long in the memory.

Now, just a few months on, some fans have amusingly recreated the infamous incident using the new FIFA 15 game.

In pictures posted to Twitter, fans have claimed the game is ‘so realistic’ for letting them relive the moment that saw the Barcelona striker banned from football for four months.

Fans have recreated the now infamous incident of Suarez's bite on the newly released FIFA 15 game

‘FIFA 15 is so realistic’ said one Twitter user beneath an image that sees Suarez sinking his teeth into Holland's Daryl Janmaat.

‘Was playing the FIFA 15 Demo earlier got to say its pretty damn realistic,’ said another tweeter under an image of Suarez and new Barcelona team-mate Ivan Rakitic. 

Of course, the ability to bite a player is not actually a feature of the new game.

Instead, the gamers have used the game’s replay mode to spot some odd player collision moments in the game.

The glitches seem to show Suarez’s mouth sinking into players, and it doesn’t help his case that in some his eyes are closed and teeth bared in an apparent biting action.

Suarez signed for Barcelona from Liverpool after the World Cup in a £75million deal.

However he is still yet to make his competitive debut as he continues to serve his ban for biting Chiellini.

And that is replicated in FIFA 15 - fans picking up the game will be unable to use Suarez in the game’s career mode for the entirety of his ban.

However playing one of the game's other modes that has full squads available without suspensions - such as an exhibition one-on-one against another gamer - allows the hilarious images to be taken.
