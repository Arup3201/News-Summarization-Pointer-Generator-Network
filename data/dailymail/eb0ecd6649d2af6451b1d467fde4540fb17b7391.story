Teenagers are being forced to burgle homes in their own neighbourhoods as a gang initiation ritual, a report has revealed.

In what used to be a crime more associated with drug addicts bent on feeding their habits, street gangs are increasingly turning their sights on residential break ins as a source of cash.

To make matters worse, experts say postcode wars with other gangs mean thugs are forced to commit violent robberies in their own communities rather than encroach on enemy territory, leaving residents in some inner-city areas too afraid to leave their homes.

Brent Council, in London, recorded a 12 per cent rise in household robberies last year, while the Metropolitan Police says around 25 per cent of
all violent burglaries in London are now committed by gangs.

Shift: In what used to be a crime more associated with drug addicts bent on feeding their habits, street gangs are increasingly turning their sights on residential break ins as a source of cash

'Initial information suggests
suspects are increasingly young people from the local area associating with
gangs and highly organised and mobile suspects who are operating across a
number of boroughs,' said Brent Council's report.

The revelation could signal a move 
away from other forms of induction rites that often involve sex or 
violence, sometimes against innocent members of public.

And it has raised fears that gangs are turning on their own neighbourhoods because they are too afraid to commit crimes in rival postcodes for fear of prompting violence from enemy outfits.

Brent councillor Zaffar Van Kalwala, 
who commissioned the research,  said: 'This is a worrying trend which I 
believe is happening across London.

'The robberies are affecting people's lives with many feeling vulnerable because of the gangs and their anti-social behaviour.

'What concerns me is that gang members never used to commit crimes on their doorstep but that is what seems to be happening now.

'These
gangs are all about defending their own postcodes, I have two gangs in 
my ward who cannot travel between their two estates. Yet, they are now 
robbing houses in their own area, it seems to be against what they stand
for.  We seem to be losing a community spirit.'

He added: 
'This is happening as safer neighbourhood teams are being cut yet it is 
becoming more dangerous particularly for more vulnerable people.'

The report said that the trend is 'a 
change from the more traditional profile of suspect, who is typically 
older, has a history of substance misuse and previous offences.'

Community leaders say the surge in 
break-ins means many residents on inner city estates are now too 
frightened to leave their homes.

Brent
borough police commander Matt Gardner said there was intelligence of 
gangs using burglaries as an initiation rite to join groups.

He said: 'There are gang members who are going out to commit burglaries among other crimes. They are doing it because it is part of organised crime network, an initiation rite or just because they can.

'We have seen a 30 per cent reduction in robbery and a slight rise of about one per cent in burglary. We are now doing a lot of work to try and get kids out of crime.

'We are giving them a chance to opt out of gangs and crime and sending out the message that if they continue they will get a criminal record and screw their life up.'

He added: 'Over a third of all burglaries are actually attempts when access was not gained, yet recording standards mean that these are still shown as burglaries. '

Brenda Linton, vice chair of St Raphael’s Residents’ Association in Brent, said: 'Many people are scared to go out because so many houses have been broken in to. We have had about 20 burglaries in the last six to eight months.

'Young people need more to do, they are bored and because of the postcode trouble they cannot move around. They are stuck on their own estates.'
