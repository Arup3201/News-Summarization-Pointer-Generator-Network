George Zimmerman's brother last night faced the public to insist his brother is 'the neighbour that everyone would want to have' and shot Trayvon Martin in while defending himself.

It came hours after his father criticised President Obama for the 'hate' he had directed at his son in the wake of the fatal shooting of the unarmed black 19-year-old that has caused outrage across the nation.

Robert Zimmerman said on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight: 'The fantasy or mythology that he 
chased a person is absolutely false. He stopped 
someone from disarming him and shooting him. He didn’t pull out a gun 
and shoot him.'

Defence: Robert Zimmerman Jr spoke out about his brother and described him as the perfect neighbour

Robert Jr insisted that, contrary to media reports, his brother was responsible and friendly as he said: 'He's the neighbour that everybody would want to have. He goes out of his way to help people - he always has.'

And he added that police footage of the killer after his arrest proved that he was injured in a fight with Trayvon: 'To me his nose looks swollen in that video.  I’m his brother.'

Robert Jr claimed his 28-year-old bother was on his way to Target when he followed Martin because he looked suspicious in the gated community where there had been several break-ins.

He said George was reaching for his phone to call 911 while confronting Martin when the 17-year-old attacked him.

'He never got to make that phone call because he was attacked by Mr. Martin,' he said, adding that the screams heard on a 911 call made by a neighbour during the confrontation sound like his brother.

'Despite those screams, no one came to his aid,' he added.

Targeted: George Zimmerman's father, Robert, appeared on camera for his interview as only a shadow, afraid to show his face on TV

Speaking out: This is the first time someone in George Zimmerman's family has been interviewed on TV following the shooting

Mr Zimmerman also insisted that his 
28-year-old brother would never utter the word 'c***', as he is accused 
of doing on another 911 call in reference to Martin.

Before ending his appearance on the show he alluded to the existence of another witness who saw the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin 'from the first blow' and would back up his story.

He spoke after
Zimmerman's father had earlier said he was shocked to see 'hate' coming from 
President Obama and other public figures.

Robert
 Zimmerman Sr, a 64-year-old Vietnam veteran and retired magistrate 
judge, said his family has received 'thousands' of death threats and 
become the targets of overwhelming public vitriol in the aftermath of 
the shooting in Sanford, Florida.

He
 defended his son's actions and claimed he was left no choice but to 
open fire after Trayvon told him 'you're going to die tonight' while the
 unarmed 17-year-old was beating the neighborhood watch volunteer.

'I never foresaw so much hate, coming
 from the president, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP,' Robert 
Zimmerman told Fox Orlando Wednesday night.

'Every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety from this or profit in some way.'

Obama famously said, 'If I had a son,
 he would look like Trayvon,' in his remarks about the shooting. He also
 called for a full investigation to 'get to the bottom of exactly what 
happened'

George Zimmerman, it was revealed earlier this week, is a registered Democrat.

Hatred? Robert Zimmerman says President Obama has helped ratchet up the pressure on his family

The elder Zimmerman would not show his
 face on camera during the interview -- the first time he has spoken out
 on television. Instead, the local TV station showed just his shadow.

He described a life where his son was 
forced to flee his home, and he and his wife were also forced to leave 
theirs to hide out while the case attracts international publicity and 
thousands of angry protestors.

'We, the entire family, we basically don't have a life,' he said.

They cannot do anything in public that includes giving their names, he said, including seeking medical care.

He called the negative attention on his family 'unimaginable.'

'I'm sorry all the hate that's going around,' he said of the anger toward his son.

Robert Zimmerman said George is 'colorblind' and was mentoring two black children before the shooting occurred.

He said the campaign against his son, especially from the lawyer representing Trayvon's parents, is a smear. 'How he is being portrayed is an absolute lie,' he said.

Robert Zimmerman said his son, who is half-white and half-Hispanic, began following Trayvon because he didn't recognize the boy.

He looked suspicious, he said, because he was walking in the grass behind the townhouses in the gated community where he lived, rather than walking in the road or on the sidewalk.

Kevin Cunningham is the Howard University law student who created the petition that demanded that authorities prosecute George Zimmerman.

The 31-year-old, who describes himself as the 'super Irish' son of activist parents, had no idea his online appeal would grow to become Change.org’s largest ever petition, amassing more than two million signatures in three weeks.

It helped draw international attention to Trayvon Martin's shooting and attracted support from people who identified themselves as family members or friends of the 17-year-old.

Cunningham, who told msnbc that he 'doesn't believe in black and white', transferred the petition to Martin's parents because he wanted to remain behind the scenes.

Additionally, when the 911 dispatcher that Zimmerman called told him he didn't need to follow the teen, he didn't go back to his car only because he wasn't sure of the address where he had stopped and seen Trayvon, who was wearing a hoodie.

Robert Zimmerman said his son walked up the street to find a street sign so he could figure out where, exactly he was. It was then, that Trayvon approached him and attacked him, Zimmerman claims.

Meanwhile,
 a video that emerged Tuesday night, that shows Zimmerman being brought 
into the Sanford police station for questioning in handcuffs.

ABC News, which obtained the video, says Zimmerman said he appears uninjured in the surveillance camera shots.

Zimmerman
 claimed to police that Trayvon punched him in the face, breaking his 
nose, then jumped on top of him and bashed his head into the sidewalk, 
putting a gash in his head. 

However, none of those wounds were visible from the video.

On NBC's the Today Show, Zimmerman's lawyer Craig Sonner, said the video proves nothing.

The
 quality is 'very grainy' and Sonner said police cleaned up his client's
 wounds before bringing him in for a police interview.
