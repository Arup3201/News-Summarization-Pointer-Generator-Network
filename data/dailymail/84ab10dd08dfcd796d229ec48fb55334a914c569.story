The legal challenge from civil liberty groups was triggered by the Edward Snowden leaks

Britain's spy agencies do harvest a ‘haystack’ of private communications by innocent people in order to target terrorist suspects, Government lawyers have admitted.

GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 need to intercept the phone calls, text messages and emails to find their criminal ‘needle’, a tribunal heard.

But lawyers representing intelligence chiefs said the mass surveillance was ‘lawful and appropriate’ and said claims it acted illegally were ‘outlandish’.

The defence was included in legal documents submitted in a landmark challenge over the activities of the spy agencies at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT).

Privacy campaigners claim that safeguards surrounding GCHQ’s collection of vast quantities of online data are inadequate and do not conform to the law.

Civil liberty groups have launched a legal challenge at the tribunal – which monitors whether the UK’s spying laws are being observed – over the alleged use of mass surveillance programs by the intelligence services.

They allege that the agencies conduct huge surveillance sweeps that are ‘not in accordance with the law’ and breach human rights.

They also claim ‘all or most’ internet and telephone communications are being routinely collected, stored and analysed, regardless of whether a person is under suspicion.

The case has been brought following the leak of documents by fugitive CIA worker Edward Snowden linked to the alleged surveillance practices of GCHQ and the US National Security Agency (NSA).

The legal battle centres on the alleged use of two programs – Prism and Tempora. Campaigners say Prism is a mass ‘data mining’ program used by the NSA and that information obtained was passed to the UK. Tempora is apparently used by GCHQ to intercept communications through fibre optic cables in and out of the UK.

The tribunal has taken the unusual step of proceeding on the basis of a series of ‘assumed facts’ because the Government will not confirm or deny much of Snowden’s claims.

It has also taken the rare step of allowing the case to be heard in open court.

In a written submission, James Eadie QC, for the Government, said the only way to intercept communications of a suspect was to ‘intercept a substantially greater volume of communications and then apply a selection stage to identify the communications in question’.

‘In other words, it is common ground that the only practical way to find and reconstruct most external communication “needles” is to look through the communications’ “haystack”,’ he said.

Mr Eadie said privacy campaigners had based their case on ‘extreme, and at times outlandish, factual assertions about the scope, scale and nature of US and UK interception programs and intelligence sharing’.

The tribunal continues.
