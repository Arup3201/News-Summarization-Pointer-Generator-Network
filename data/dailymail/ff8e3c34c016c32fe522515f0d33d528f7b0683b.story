David Cameron claimed it had been a 'good day' for his Europe policy after former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson dramatically called for Britain to leave the EU.

The explosive intervention threatened to destroy Tory unity around the Prime Minister's pledge to hold an in-out referendum if he wins the 2015 general election.

But Mr Cameron brushed aside fears the issue could hijack his next two years in power, insisting only he was willing to give voters a say on severing ties with Brussels.

Lord Lawson of Blaby, 81, described
 the EU as ‘a bureaucratic monstrosity’ and said leaving ‘would 
substantially outweigh the costs’. 'The case for exit is clear,' he 
said.

Margaret Thatcher’s longest-serving Chancellor pledged
 to vote No in any referendum 
on membership, in a move that piles further pressure on Mr Cameron, 
emboldening Tory Eurosceptics and threatening the stability of the 
coalition.

But Mr Cameron played down the threat to his position. He told a press conference: 'I think it has been a good day for the pledge that I have made that, if re-elected, I will hold an in/out referendum so that everybody can have not just a voice about Britain's future in Europe but also have a vote about Britain's future in Europe.

'I welcome the attention that has been placed on this key pledge that I have made. Only a Conservative Government, only the Conservatives of the major parties, are making this promise.

'I want to give people a choice not between the status quo and leaving the EU. I want to give people a choice between Britain remaining in a reformed EU or leaving that EU. That is the choice that people want and there is only one way to get it and that is by supporting the Conservatives at the next election.'

'Bureaucratic monstrosity': Lord Lawson says the EU has served its purpose and Britain should now withdraw

The Prime Minister will use this week's Queen's Speech to react to the rise of the UK Independence Party, which won more than 140 council seats in last week's local elections.

He had hoped the promise to renegotiate a new deal with Brussels, followed by a referendum by 2017, would placate Eurosceptics in his party. Mr Cameron would campaign to stay in the EU.

But Lord Lawson ridiculed the plan as 'inconsequential', with Britain 'consistently outvoted' by countries in the Eurozone.

He said the nature of the EU had 'fundamentally change' since the creation of the single currency.

'That is why, while I voted “in” in 1975, I shall be voting “out” in 2017,' he wrote in The Times.

While there would be ‘some economic cost’ from leaving the EU single 
market, Lord Lawson went on, ‘in my judgment the economic gains would 
substantially outweigh the costs.’

He called the EU ‘an institution that has achieved its historic purpose 
and is now past its sell-by date’ and said British industry should focus
 on the developing world.

Mr Cameron is resisting pressure to hold a referendum next spring in 
which voters would be asked if they supported a looser relationship with
 Brussels.

In January David Cameron set out his detailed timetable for staging a historic referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.

He received plaudits in January when he promised that if he is still Prime Minister after the 2015 general election, he would seek a 'fresh settlement' with the EU before putting it to the people in a referendum. But he made clear that he thought Britain was better off in the EU.

Lord Lawson likened the idea of renegotiating terms with Brussels to similar talks held by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson 40 years ago.

'The changes that Wilson was able to negotiate were so trivial that I doubt if anyone today can remember what they were. But he was able to secure a 2-1 majority for the “in” vote in the 1975 referendum.

'I have no doubt that any changes that Mr Cameron — or, for that matter, Ed Miliband — is able to secure will be equally inconsequential'.

In recent weeks the rise of UKIP has 
startled the political establishment, culminating in dramatic gains in 
last week's council elections in which Mr Farage's party took almost one
 in four votes.

Today Mr 
Farage seized on Lord Lawson's article, saying it 'legitimises the UKIP 
position and exposes serious divisions in the Tory Party'.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg 
said Tory policy on Europe should not be shaped by a knee-jerk response 
to the threat posed by UKIP.

'I
 know the Conservatives are struggling to work out how to deal with UKIP
 and they keep now changing their minds: one minute they want to be in 
the European Union, now senior Conservatives like Nigel Lawson say they 
want to go out,' he told ITV's Daybreak.

'I
 think we need to transform the European Union to make it more 
transparent more efficient, more democratic where we can, but not turn 
our backs on it because doing so would make us less safe and less 
prosperous.'

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Lord Lawson's 
intervention 'legitimises' his own calls for exit from the EU while Lib 
Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Tories were 'struggling' to cope with the
 rise of UKIP

Mr Clegg warned that leaving the EU 'would jeopardise up to three million jobs in this country'.

Senior Tory backbenchers want Mr 
Cameron to deliver on his hint last week that he could bring forward 
legislation on staging a referendum before 2015.

British must do more to understand Europe, a senior Brussels commissioner has suggested.

Trade commissioner Karel de Gucht said UK politicians did not need to 'love' the EU, but needed to get to know it better.

'It’s really amazing how little a lot of British politicians know about Europe,' he told The Independent.

'You need decision on the basis of facts and figures and arguments, not on the basis of myths. Why don’t people tell the truth about the EU.

'They should get better acquainted with it. We don’t want you to love Europe, love should be kept for personal relationships. But look at your own interests and ‘de-dramatise’ all this.'

He warned British leaders against a 'blame game' with Brussels for the UK's problems.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I think we need to demonstrate absolutely that we are serious about this referendum.

‘Anything we can to do to strengthen that offer I am prepared to consider.’

But without the support of Lib Dems in a Commons vote, it is almost certain to be defeated.

Former Tory minister Sir Gerald Howarth said Mr Cameron faces a 'big challenge'.

'If those changes that he can secure are ‘inconsequential’, in the words of Lord Lawson, then clearly that will leave us with only one option, which is to leave,' he told BBC Radio 4.

'And I think the challenge for our European partners - that’s actually a rather bigger challenge for them than it is for us - is to come up with some substantial changes that will meet the aspirations of the British people who are becoming increasingly more eurosceptic.'

A
 Downing Street spokesman said: 'The PM has always been clear: we need a
 Europe that is more open, more competitive, and more flexible; a Europe
 that wakes up to the modern world of competition. In short, Europe has 
to reform.

'But
 our continued membership must have the consent of the British people, 
which is why the PM has set out a clear timetable on this issue.'

Both Labour and the Lib Dems are opposed to Mr Cameron's idea of a referendum, arguing it would create uncertainty and risk jobs.

But Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure from senior backbenchers to back the idea of giving voters a say.

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, said on Twitter: 'An in/out referendum before the next election would clear the air. We could actually hold it on the day of the next general election.'

It comes as one of the euro’s most prominent cheerleaders has called for
 the single currency to be scrapped.

Senior Labour MP Keith Vaz backed the idea of an early referendum to 'clear the air'

Rethink: Oskar Lafontaine, who was Germany's finance minister when the euro was adopted has called for the currency to be broken up so that southern Europe can recover from economic crisis

Former German finance minister 
Oskar Lafontaine warned the current course is ‘leading to disaster’ and 
the ‘situation is worsening from month to month’.

He said crisis-hit countries in southern Europe, including France, will 
be ‘forced by their current misery to fight back against German hegemony
 sooner or later’.

It marks a stunning U-turn for the Left-wing 
politician, Germany’s finance minister when the euro was launched in 
1999.

Critics labelled him Europe’s most dangerous man after he called for the
 ‘end of the nation state’ in favour of a ‘united Europe’ in 1998. But 
the euro crisis has caused Mr Lafontaine to change his tune.

Awakening: Mr Lafontaine said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would 'awake from her self-righteous slumber' once troubled eurozone countries forced through a change in policy at Germany's expense

The 69-year-old former minister says the single currency must be broken 
up to allow bailed-out countries, including Greece, Portugal, Spain and 
Cyprus, to recover.

He said: ‘The economic situation is worsening from month to month and 
unemployment has reached a level that puts democratic structures ever 
more in doubt.’

He added that Chancellor Angela Merkel ‘will awake from her 
self-righteous slumber’ when the troubled countries unite, forcing 
policy changes at Germany’s expense.

In a final admission that the single currency had failed, Mr Lafontaine 
said: ‘Hopes that the creation of the euro would force rational economic
 behaviour on all sides were in vain.’
