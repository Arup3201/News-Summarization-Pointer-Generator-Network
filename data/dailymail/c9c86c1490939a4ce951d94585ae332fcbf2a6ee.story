Jenson Button does not believe Mercedes can hide or manipulate the volatile relationship between their two drivers, Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.

Button, who partnered Hamilton for three years at McLaren said: 'The drivers need to sort it between themselves. We're all grown ups. It's down to you to solve it, not for the team to cover your issues. If they do that it looks too obvious.'

Hamilton was angered by Rosberg's last qualifying lap in Monaco a fortnight ago, believing the German veered off the road deliberately.

Despite Hamilton stated at the end of the race that they were not friends, he published a tweet a few days later saying they had made up.

Whether Mercedes and/or Hamilton's manager had a hand in this public rapprochement is unclear.

But, speaking in Montreal yesterday ahead of Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix, Hamilton maintained the sentiment was genuine.  'I said it in the message,' he said.

'We spoke after the race. Like other friends, we have our ups and downs. We've known each other for a long, long time. It's done and dusted and we look forward to working together to help this team win the constructors' championship.

'Nico and I spoke to each other and then we individually spoke to the team. Nothing has really changed. The team have done a great job in supporting us. Their support for both of us has been great. We are now full steam ahead.'

Rosberg and Hamilton dined together, albeit in a big group, at The Keg Steakhouse and Bar in the city's old town district on Wednesday night.

'Things have never been better,' said Hamilton. 'We're going from strength to strength. People have ups and downs and it's no different to any other experience me and Nico have had in our years racing together. We move on.

'We're pushing forward. There's a long way to go in the season so I'm looking forward to that battle.'

Rosberg, who looked relaxed as he conducted his media briefings in the paddock a couple of tables away from Hamilton, said: 'I am quite neutral about my relationship with Lewis. It is always going to be the case that you have some difficult times which will be followed by good times.

'Our strength is that we always talk about what has happened and go through things as we did when we were both 14. It is always going to be like that, and indeed it continues to be like that.

'I don't want to go into that detail of what was said, but be sure that when there are difficult moments we discuss them and move on, so there is nothing out of the ordinary in any way.'

Hamilton is favourite to win the Canadian Grand Prix and retake the championship lead from four behinds behind Rosberg.

This track is perhaps the one on which he strongest. He won here in 2007 – his first Formula One victory – 2010 and 2012.
