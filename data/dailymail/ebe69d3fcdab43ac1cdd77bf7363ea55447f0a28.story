President Barack Obama has rounded up a new golf partner as he played with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key today.

The two leaders teed off on a sunny and breezy morning at a course at a military base on Oahu, the Hawaiian island where Obama is renting a vacation home.

New Zealand media has reported that Mr Key owns a home in Hawaii.

Leading the pack: Obama played with New Zealand's prime minister John Key (right) who has a house in Hawaii and was there for the holidays with his family, just like the Obamas

In the hot seat: President Obama generally plays golf with close friends, and on rare occasions, political allies, but Mr Key is now one of the few foreign leaders who can add his name to the list

The golf outing put Key in rarified company as Obama, an avid golfer, prefers to limit his playing partners to a close circle of friends and advisers.

Among those who have also scored invitations to play with Obama in the past are former President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker John Boehner.

Rounding out the foursome Thursday were Max Key, the prime minister's teenage son, and Marvin Nicholson, Obama's personal aide.

Media access to Obama's rounds is typically restricted, though reporters and photographers were permitted to briefly watch the two leaders Thursday.Â

The foursome pulled up to the green on the second hole in two golf carts, with the president and prime minister driving together.

Obama's first putt was short of the hole and his second landed just wide.

Rather than putt a third time, he opted for a gimme shot, where all players agree to count a shot as made rather than take another stroke.

After the younger Key sank his putt, Obama gave him a high-five and joked, 'He's doing it in front of the cameras, too.'

Key has served as New Zealand's prime minister since 2008.
