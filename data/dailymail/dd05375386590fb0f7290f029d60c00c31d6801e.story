This clip captures the moment an ice fisherman is outsmarted by his catch.

The Russian fisherman makes the mistake of assuming the fish he has just reeled in is subdued - before leaving it unattended.

And as he leaves it near the hole in the ice, the fish is seen wriggling back into the water and taking the rod it is still attached to with it.

This video captures the moment an ice fisherman is outsmarted by his own catch, who escapes with his rod

The ice fisherman from Russia reels in the large fish but appears to have difficult removing the hook

The two-minute clip begins with the fisherman approaching the spot of ice and spending a few moments reeling the large fish in.

Once it has been caught, he appears to have difficulty removing the hook and puts the fish down as he leaves to fetch some tools.

With the fisherman out of sight, the fish suddenly begins to flop around.

Once he is out of sight, the fish suddenly begins to flop around until it finds the hole and jumps into the lake

It soon finds the hole and jumps back into the lake - taking the rod with it.

The fisherman spies what's happening and runs towards the hole, but arrives too late to save his rod or the fish.

Raising his hands in the air, he stares into the hole for a few moments before prodding the ice with a piece of wood - with no luck.
