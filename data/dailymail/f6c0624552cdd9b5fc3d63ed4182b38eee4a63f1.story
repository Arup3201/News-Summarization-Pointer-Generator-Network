Controversial Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has agreed to step down after negotiating a deal with coalition allies, it was reported today - just hours ahead of a crucial European Union meeting.

Berlusconi, 75, is said to have made the agreement with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, after he agreed to a deal on pension reforms as part of a package to reassure Europe Italy was doing its best to handle the financial crisis.

Steeped in several scandals, many have questioned whether Berlusconi is able to steer the third largest economy in the Eurozone to safety and avoid a Greek-style bailout to save it plunging over the abyss.

Has Silvio Berlusconi agreed to resign? It was reported today that the Italian Prime Minister has made an agreement to step down

According to respected daily La Repubblica, Berlusconi is said to have told Bossi: 'Let's avoid an embarrassment in Brussels and I promise you there will be elections in March.'

La Repubblica also added that Berlusconi had even agreed to step down by January at the latest, in return for Bossi accepting to agreeing for the pension age to be raised to 67 years old.

However, the reports of his intended 
resignation were denied by his spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti and also by 
Northern League spokeswoman Nicoletta Maggi who said: 'There is no truth
in the reports at all.'

Another source close to Berlusconi also dismissed the reports and said: 'This is all part of the theatre of politics and there is nothing in it at all - it is all fantasy.'

La Repubblica added that in exchange for resigning Berlusconi would also accept Northern League demands for liberlisation and privitisation - elements that they have campaigned for and have proved issues between them in the past.

If true, it will be the second time that Berlusconi's hand has been forced by the Northern League - in 1994 he was famously 'stabbed in the back' by Bossi when his government was just eight month old and it collapsed.

But there is growing feeling that Berlusconi is not able to deal with the crisis and there were reports earlier this year that said he wanted to 'throw in the towel' and escape to the Caribbean where he has a holiday home.

sex parties allegedly held by Berlusconi

He is currently facing four trials, 
including one for having sex with an underage prostitute which resumes 
next month, as does another for corruption. The other trials are for 
financial irregularties and abuse of office.

In
recent months, he has been at the centre of controversy after it 
emerged that escorts were among women invited to parties he hosted at 
his official residence in Rome.

There were also allegedly wild scenes at
his infamous 'bunga bunga' night.
