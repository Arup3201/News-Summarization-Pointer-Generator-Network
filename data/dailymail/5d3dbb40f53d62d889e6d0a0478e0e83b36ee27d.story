The husband of model Katie Cleary has shot himself dead just weeks after she was pictured getting cozy with Leonardo DiCaprio, it has emerged.

Entrepreneur Andrew Stern, 40, shot himself in the head on Sunday while he was at a shooting range in the San Fernando Valley, California, law enforcement sources told TMZ.

Cleary and Stern, who had appeared on Bravo's dating show Millionaire Matchmaker before marrying the model in 2010, were in the process of getting a divorce, sources added.

Interviews with the couple's friends revealed he was 'suffering significant stress over marital problems' and had a history of depression, TMZ reported, while others said he had financial strains.

Tragic: Andrew Stern, who is married to model Katie Cleary, has shot himself dead at a shooting range

The tragedy comes just four weeks after 32-year-old Cleary was pictured getting close to DiCaprio at the Gotha nightclub in Cannes.

The pair were seen chatting and dancing closely, while DiCaprio was pictured whispering into the model's ear. The apparent closeness came even though DiCaprio is dating Victoria's Secret model Toni Garrn.

Katie, who is from Glenview, Illinois, appeared on the first series of America's Next Top Model while she was still a college student, before landing the role of 'briefcase beauty' on popular game show Deal Or No Deal.

The brunette beauty has since had minor roles in The Break Up, Iron Man 2 and Entourage, while appearing in advertising campaigns for Sketchers, Nike and Elastiderm.

Stern had set up his own successful marketing firm after graduating from Miami University in Oxford,

 working for other companies, he started his career with the Los Angeles
 Lakers, Taco Bell, Southwest Airlines and Pepsi, according to an obituary posted on Performance Marketing Insider by a business friend, Pace Lattin.

After
 working with professional athletes including Kobe Bryant and Anna 
Kournikova at Broadband Sports, he joined L90 Worldwide as a sales and 
media planner, it noted.

In 2002, he founded Seed Corn Advertising and went on to produce movies, launch 
restaurants, real estate and 'brokering exotic cars', the obituary said.

He also featured on Season 2 of the hit TV show 'Millionaire Matchmaker' before marrying Cleary, 'the love of his life', Lattin wrote.

'Andrew kept his original company, never sold out, always was making money and working hard,' he wrote.

'We both started in the industry at the same time, and his passing makes me extremely sad. We were both young kids in this industry, and grew up making money in this industry - and everyone I know did business with him at one time or another.'
