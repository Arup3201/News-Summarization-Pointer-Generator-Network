Two bombs in the Iraqi capital have killed more than 20 people just hours before the city's longtime curfew was set to come to an end.

The deadliest attack happened in the New Baghdad section of the city. A suicide bomber detonated inside a restaurant in the predominantly Shi'ite neighbourhood of New Baghdad  killing at least 12 people and wounding 30 more.

Shortly afterwards, another two bombs went off at the busy Sharqa market district, killing 10 more. A total of 22 people were killed and a further 55 injured in the attacks.

No-one has stepped forward to take responsibility for the attacks, but suicide bombings are commonly used by armed groups in Iraq, including ISIS and the Levant.

The interior ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan said he did not believe the blasts were linked to the decision to lift the curfew. 

The incident comes ahead of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's decision to lift Iraq's longtime curfew beginning at midnight Sunday.

A form of curfew has been in place since the US-led invasion in 2003 against Saddam Hussein, with citizens restricted between midnight and 5am.

Baghdad has remained relatively calm amid a rampage in northern and western Iraq by the al-Qaida-inspired Islamic State group. 

Recent bombings have frequently targeted Shiite-majority areas in the capital, including a bomb attack in central Baghdad on January 30 which killed 12 civilians when a blast went off in the Bab al-Sharqi district was followed by a car bomb.

But the violence has been comparatively subdued from the darkest days of sectarian bloodletting in 2006 and 2007.

Iraqi officials have repeated assured that the capital is secure, despite the occasional targeting of Baghdad's Shiite-majority neighborhoods by the Sunni militant group.
