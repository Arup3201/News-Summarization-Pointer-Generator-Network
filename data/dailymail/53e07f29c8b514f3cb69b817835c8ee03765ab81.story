Fernando Alonso has accused the Italian media of attempting to destabilise Ferrari following the latest rumours linking him with a move away from the team.

Earlier this week it was reported Alonso and Sebastian Vettel would swap teams for next season, despite the former having another two years remaining on his contract, whilst the latter has an additional year with Red Bull.

Alonso is clearly becoming exasperated at the need to constantly fend off questions on the subject of whether he will leave Ferrari, more so than the team's lack of results as he is now without a win for 27 races, a statistic that often fuels the rumours regarding a potential departure.

Asked to clarify the situation ahead of Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, Alonso said: 'I've been commenting about my future for 13 months now - since last August - so I have nothing new to say.

'Sometimes it's sad when it comes from Italy, or they create these rumours for some strange purpose which is not helping Ferrari, which is why we're all here.

'Ferrari is a much bigger brand than any individual person, or even Formula One in general.

'I respect Ferrari a lot and I try to create a good atmosphere in the team with the guys - from going out to dinner to playing basketball, playing poker, whatever - to ensure we are united.

'It's what we need, and it's what people expect from us driving for Ferrari and working for Ferrari.

'So when all these things come from Italy, it's not really clear what the purpose is. When we know then one day I will tell you.'

Alonso's frustration is matched by Vettel, especially this season now he is on the back foot after four years of title glory.

Giving short shrift to the interviewer when quizzed on his future, Vettel said: 'I'm not thinking any differently to when I was asked the question a couple of weeks ago.

'I have a contract, and nothing has changed. The relationship I have with Red Bull is very special as they've been supporting me since I was 12 years old.

'Back then it was impossible to predict what would happen, that one day they would have their own team, or two Formula One teams.

'It was impossible to know I would be driving for one of them at some stage, or both of them.

'So it's impossible to predict the future. I've been with Red Bull a long time, I have a strong link to them, so in that regard nothing has changed, and doesn't look like it will change.'
