A footballer who posted a homophobic message about Tom Daley and his Olympic diving partner Peter Waterfield will not face the courts.

The message sent by Daniel Thomas, who plays for Port Talbot in Wales, was 'not so grossly offensive that criminal charges need to be brought', Keir Starmer the Director of Public Prosecutions said today.

The offensive tweet, which was deleted, appeared online after Daley, 18, and Waterfield, finished fourth in the 10m synchronised dive this summer.

Investigation: No charges were brought because the tweet was not 'grossly offensive' and Tom Daley (pictured) was not meant to see it

It came as a man, 22, was arrested for 
setting up an offensive Facebook page relating to the murder of two 
Manchester policewomen on Tuesday, where he called suspect Dale Cregan a
'legend'.

Mr Starmer said that Thomas had expressed 
remorse and taken 'reasonably swift action' to remove the message and 
that because human rights law also gave people the right to 'offend, 
shock and disturb' others prosecution was not appropriate.

Policy: Keir Starmer QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, announced the decision and also new guidelines to frame social media prosecutions

It was only meant to be seen by the Port Talbot Town's friends and family, and was not sent directly to the divers.

Mr Starmer added: 'This was, in essence, a one-off offensive Twitter message, intended for family and friends, which made its way into the public domain.

'It was not intended to reach Mr Daley or Mr Waterfield, it was not part of a campaign, it was not intended to incite others and Mr Thomas removed it reasonably swiftly and has expressed remorse. Against that background,  it was not so grossly offensive that criminal charges need to be brought.'

Thomas was suspended by Port Talbot Town but is now playing for them again.

The announcement — which is likely to be welcomed by civil liberties campaigners — came as Mr Starmer announced new legal guidelines are to be drawn up over when charges will be brought over abuse on Twitter and other social media sites.

He said he planned to set a 'high threshold' for launching criminal action against people who post offensive tweets in recognition of the 'spontaneous' way in which people used social media.

Mr Starmer said he wanted to consult the public before drawing up the  guidelines, which were needed because of the 'clear difference' between the way that people used social media sites and other forms of communication and because of the vast number of messages posted 'instantaneously' that reached millions of people when they were only intended to be read by a few.

The DPP warned that criminal action would still be needed to 'prosecute serious wrongdoing' in any future cases involving “sustained harassment” or the posting of 'grossly offensive or threatening remarks' on Twitter or other social media sites. But he wanted to ensure that the 'fundamental right to free speech' was respected.

He added: 'The CPS has the task of balancing the fundamental right of free speech and the need to prosecute serious wrongdoing on a case by case basis. That often involves very difficult judgment calls.

'In some cases it is clear that a criminal prosecution is the appropriate response to conduct which is complained about.

'But in many other cases a criminal prosecution will not be the appropriate response. If the fundamental right to free speech is to be respected, the threshold for criminal prosecution has to be a high one.'

The DPP said he would now draw up interim guidelines for prosecutors on when charges should, or should not, be brought before holding a 'wide public consultation' ahead of the publication of finalised rules.

Police have admitted they are being dragged into too many Twitter disputes as a row raged over the decision to arrest a different youth who abused Olympic diving star Tom Daley.

Officers swooped on the home of Reece Messer, 17, at 2.45am last month hours after he told the sports star he had ‘let down’  his late father in the London 2012 synchronised ten metre final.

Messer also threatened to ‘drown’ the 18-year-old but backtracked and apologised when his messages provoked an online storm.

Dorset police handed the troubled teenager a formal harassment warning, police leaders claimed forces are being dragged into too many petty social media rows.

Officers were asked to look at content 14,000 times on Facebook alone last year and Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers,  said forces do not have the resources to monitor the internet.

He said: ‘There is legislation which concerns causing harassment, alarm or distress. But can we police the internet when someone upsets someone else?

‘I don’t think we have the resources to do that. We can’t have a free-for-all online but we cannot involve the police every time something unpleasant is said.’

Since Twitter's huge boom in popularity in Britain there have been a number of cases that have tested the boundaries of the current Communications Act, which polices the online world.

No case sums up the flaws in the system more than the now infamous Twitter joke trial where the High Court ruled that telling jokes about blowing up an airport is not a crime.

And now just two months on Keir Starmer has moved to try to clarify the law which has left some victims of trolls unprotected and others unfairly targeted by the police and the courts.

In the landmark ruling in late July, Lord Judge overturned the conviction of a
frustrated airline passenger who tweeted that he meant to blow up the 
airport.

Paul Chambers, 28,
had been convicted of sending a menacing message even though he 
broadcast his joke in his own name and no one at Robin Hood Airport in 
Doncaster took it seriously.

The
Crown Prosecution Service took him to court under the 2003 
Communications Act, and Doncaster magistrates told him to pay £600 
costs, a £385 fine and £15 victim surcharge. The conviction in May 2010 
was later upheld by a Crown Court judge.

Bu the Lord Chief Justice said a joke could not by definition be
menacing: ‘If the persons who receive and read it, or may reasonably be
expected to receive it, or read it, would brush it aside as a silly 
joke, or a joke in bad taste... it would be a contradiction in terms to 
describe it as a message of a menacing character.’

The ruling was hailed as a victory for free speech and a rebuke to over-zealous police and lawyers.

Mr
Chambers, from Corby, Northamptonshire, lost his job as an 
administration manager after he was convicted and said he had become 
unemployable because of the prosecution.

He
sent his tweet when snow shut the airport in January 2010. It said: 
‘Robin Hood Airport is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get your 
s*** together otherwise I am blowing the airport sky high!!’

He
said after the ruling: ‘It’s a very big decision for people doing what 
human beings do – telling a joke sometimes, even if it’s a bad one.’

The
judges noted there was no evidence before the Crown Court to suggest 
any of the followers of the 'tweet', or anyone else who may have seen it
posted on Mr Chambers’ timeline, found it to be of a menacing character
or, at a time when the threat of terrorism was real, even minimally 
alarming.
