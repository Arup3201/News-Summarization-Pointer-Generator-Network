Commuters were facing a miserable return to work today after the Christmas holiday, as the stormy weather wreaked havoc on the road and rail networks.

Millions of workers and schoolchildren were due back at their desks this morning after the festive break but they were warned to expect closures, delays and cancellations as torrential rain and gales continue to batter the country.

The south of England, Wales and coastal areas across the country are bracing for heavy rain and winds of up to 70mph for at least another two days, as emergency services attempt to cope with the trail of devastation caused by the worst Atlantic storms in 20 years.

In Worcester swans have taken over the streets after the river Severn bursts it's banks once more.

Shepherd's warning: This was the dramatic red sky that greeted residents of Warwick on Sunday morning. And, as the folklore goes, it had a warning for commuters returning to work

Three people have died and hundreds 
of homes have been flooded as huge swathes of the countryside disappear 
below water, while waves of more than 40ft have pounded coastal areas. 

Almost 300 flood warnings and alerts are in place, and scores of people have been evacuated from their homes.

David Cameron was yesterday forced to deny that cuts in the budget for flood defences had made matters worse.

As
 Environment Secretary Owen Paterson chaired a meeting of the 
Government’s Cobra emergency committee, the Prime Minister insisted he 
was committed to ensuring the Environment Agency had the funds for 
frontline services.

‘The 
Environment Agency does have to make sure that it controls its budgets 
carefully, but we are making sure that they invest in the frontline,’  
he said.

Foolhardy: A man in St Aubin, Jersey, photographs his son as a huge wave rises behind

The boy looks ever so tiny against the backdrop of a colossal wave – but this is a dramatic photograph for all the wrong reasons.

Despite repeated warnings from emergency services to stay away from the coastline,  thrill-seekers are still risking their lives.

Police asked a man in St Aubin, Jersey, to move away from the area after he was spotted taking a picture of his son by a low sea wall.

Wave watchers were also spotted leaning against the sea wall in Mudeford, near Christchurch in Dorset, despite the surges. It seems lessons haven’t been learned from the pictures that emerged at the weekend of a university student being saved by the RNLI.

Edward Laxton, 21, was almost washed off a wooden jetty in Aberystwyth, Wales, after going out to take photos.

On Friday, a family narrowly avoided being swept off a sea wall in Mullion Cove, Cornwall, after a 20ft wave crashed over them.

Yesterday, the Coastguard, Environment Agency and RNLI urged the public to avoid the coast for their safety, as well as that of rescue services.

The Met Office 
warned that up to 40mm (1.5 inches) of rain would fall on higher ground 
over the next 48 hours in southern parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, 
southern Wales, north-east England and the South.

Gusts
 of up to 70mph are also expected on the west and south-east coasts of 
Britain, which will cause ‘exceptionally high waves’, it said.

Forecaster
 Matt Dobson, of MeteoGroup, said many areas were waterlogged after 
weeks of severe weather and prone to further flooding.

‘It’s
 very unusual to have so many powerful storms come in one after the 
other in such a short space of time – we haven’t seen anything like this
 since about 1991,’ he said.

‘Any
 rain will mean more flooding as the ground is saturated and swollen 
rivers are coming up against strong waves. The water simply has nowhere 
to go.’

The conditions were expected to bring havoc to train services across the South during the Monday morning commute.

Some
 Welsh services had already been cancelled last night by Great Western 
Trains, while South West Trains said it had a team of engineers on 
stand-by to deal with flooded sites and fallen trees. Drivers were also 
warned to take extra care on the roads, and the RAC said it was 
expecting 4,000 extra call-outs.

The
 storms have claimed three lives since New Year’s Eve, with hope also 
fading for missing student Harry Martin, 18, who disappeared in Newton 
Ferrers, Devon, after going  out to take pictures of the weather.

The
 Environment Agency has issued 72 flood warnings, while another 213 
areas are on alert. According to its figures, 220 homes have so far 
flooded but the real figure is feared to be much higher.

Large parts of the town’s promenade 
were destroyed and an 8ft hole torn in the side of the sea wall by huge 
waves, which caused hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage, 
over the weekend.

Hope was 
also fading last night for missing university student, Harry Martin, 18,
 who was last seen heading for the coastal path in Newton Ferrers, 
Devon, after telling relatives he was going out to take pictures of the 
stormy weather.

The Environment Agency has issued 72 flood warnings, while another 213 areas are on alert.

Arriva Trains Wales services between Machynlleth and Aberystwyth, Llanelli and Carmarthen, and Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog, were also facing disruption

Buses are currently replacing trains between Machynlleth and Pwllheli while the line is closed because of the significant damage caused along the track

It urged communities in Dorset and Oxfordshire to remain prepared for ‘significant flooding’ in the lower reaches of the Thames, Dorset Stour and Frome rivers.

Ongoing flooding is expected on the Somerset Levels and rivers in the South East, including the Severn, remain ‘very high’ after recent rainfall.

In Somerset one woman who had been stranded in her flooded home for the past 13 days was finally rescued yesterday.

Anne-Marie Simpson had been cut off since the River Tone burst its banks when an initial wave of storms swept Britain on December 23.

She moved upstairs, stockpiled dry food and decided to 'wait it out' until the water level receded.

But further heavy rain only made the situation worse and yesterday she was taken back to dry land by a rescue crew from the Burnham Area Rescue Boat.

Pictures yesterday showed large swathes of Gloucestershire and Worcestershire completely submerged, with the historic Tewkesbury Abbey and scores of homes and businesses in the surrounding area apparently marooned by flood waters.

Emergency services also rescued four people from a flooded farm in Llanbedr near Barmouth, north west Wales, and a pregnant woman was helped to safety after 30 properties were flooded in Cardigan, mid-Wales.

Seven wild horses were also rescued by the RSPCA from a flooded field in Christchurch, Dorset.
