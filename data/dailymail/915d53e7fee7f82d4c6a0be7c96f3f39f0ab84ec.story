Reunited: Martin Robson Riley with his grandfather's World War One Medal that vanished 30 years ago

A World War One medal that vanished 30 years ago has been reunited with the soldier's grandson after he spotted it on eBay. 

Martin Robson Riley, 45, said he was left 'flabbergasted' when he came across the Victory Medal awarded to his grandfather in 1919.

The medal, and one other belonging to Private Henry Riley, had disappeared from the family home in Bournbrook, Birmingham, but the Victory medal eventually found its way to a dealer in Cornwall who put it up for auction.

Mr Riley, from Llandre, Ceredigion, 
Wales, says it was 'sheer chance' that he found the medal on the online 
auction site with a starting price of just 99p.

Mr
Riley, who works at the National Library of Wales, said: 'I couldn’t 
believe my eyes when I saw my grandfather’s name and regimental number 
come up as part of the description for the medal.

'I
hadn’t been actively looking for it, but I’d occasionally type my 
grandfather’s name and the word 'medal' into search engines to see what 
happened and out of sheer chance when I looked last week, there it was.

'I
emailed the seller to explain who my grandfather was and he sent me 
the medal for free, saying I had more of a claim to it than anyone. I can’t thank him enough for his kindness.'

Private
Riley served with the Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry on the Western 
Front from 1916, serving in the battle of Arras in 1917 before being 
gassed by the Germans.

He returned to the army and served with the British forces who occupied the Rhine after the war ended in 1918.

The
medal’s dedication 'The Great War for Civilisation 1914 to 1919' is 
because under British common law the war 'officially' ended in 1919.

But the war took its toll and Private Riley died in 1927 at the age of just 28 so Mr Riley never got to meet the man whose medal he now owns.

He said: 'My grandmother remarried and when her second husband died in 1981 we went to clear the house and the medals were missing.

'We don’t know if they were stolen, sold or given away, but after 30 years I’m absolute over the moon to be able to hold it.'

Around six million Victory Medals were issued to Allied servicemen, with the recipient’s service number, rank, name and unit engraved on the rim.

Private Riley’s other missing medal, the British War Medal, was not amongst those being sold by the dealer.

Mr Riley, who moved to Ceredigion with his wife Gill 15 years ago, said: 'I’m optimistic that it’s still out there somewhere. I just hope it doesn’t take me another 30 years to find it!'
