Nancy Lanza, Adam Lanza's mom, comes was, in part, blamed for contributing to the tragedy by fostering her son's fascination with guns

A Connecticut panel developing a report on the Newtown school massacre has staged a debate on whether the final death toll of victims should include the shooter's mother.

The difficult decision on whether to include Nancy Lanza, Adam Lanza's mom, comes after she was, in part, blamed for contributing to the tragedy by fostering her son's fascination with guns.

Her son, Adam Lanza began his horrific rampage on December 14, 2012, by killing his mom inside their Newtown home before gunning down 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

He then turned the gun on himself, committing suicide.

To date, a draft of the dedication for the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission's report references 26 victims - which include 20 innocent first graders and six teachers.

But commissioner Harold Schwartz asked at a hearing if Nancy Lanza should not also be considered a victim.  

Although the commission ultimately agreed to leave her name out, Schwartz suggested mentioning her at least in a footnote.

Schwartz, a psychiatry professor at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine said: 'I'm not certain it is morally right to not acknowledge her as a victim.'

The role of Nancy Lanza, who often took her son to shooting ranges and bought the rifle he would use in the school massacre, has been a difficult one for Newtown.

Some friends have said she did her best raising a troubled son, but a report by the state's Office of the Child Advocate concluded she contributed to his isolation as she kept him at home.

There, he was surrounded by an arsenal of firearms as he whiled away hours playing violent video games.

Last week,officials in Newtown voted  to tear down the home where Adam Lanza lived before he carried out the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The vote by the Newtown Legislative Council approved a proposal by the board of selectmen to raze the 3,100-square-foot home and keep the land as open space.

However, Commission chairman, Scott Jackson, the mayor of Hamden, said it is impossible to know how much responsibility Nancy Lanza bears.

'I think that's why number 27 is always so difficult, because there's so much we don't know,' Jackson said.

The advisory commission, created by Governor Dannel P. Malloy in the wake of the shooting, plans to issue its report in February with dozens of policy recommendations.

They will include law enforcement and emergency response, school design and mental health and wellness.

And, after the suggestion to adjust the death toll, several commission members said they wanted to leave the dedication intact for just the 26 people killed at the school.

Commissioner Adrienne Bentman asked how other victims' families might feel about seeing Nancy Lanza's name on the same page with those of their loved ones.
