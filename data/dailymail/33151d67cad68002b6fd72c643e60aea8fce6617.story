A state politician in Missouri shocked his followers Monday by posting a lewd meme poking fun at male erections.

Republican Representative Mark Parkinson's phallic faux pas appeared only briefly and featured a man on a couch hidden by his outsized equipment.

But it was long enough force the lawmaker into a hasty apology.

Shocking: Missouri state Rep. Mark Parkinson tweeted out this lewd meme on Monday to the shock of his 2,000-plus followers

Apologized: Parkinson, a Republican, immediately apologized for the tweet after promptly taking it down

'Obviously, I need to change my twitter password. Random pics and tweets are being sent that I have never seen before,' Parkinson tweeted soon after taking down the inappropriate meme. 'Apologies!'

Parkinson went on to insist his account had been hacked and that there was no way he could have personally posted the tweet.

'I'm out walking doors,' he told a doubtful Twitter follower. 'I have no idea where those tweets are originating from.'

As the Daily Dot points out, the politician could have easily tweeted from a cell phone. Though, his followers seem to be taking the denial at face value.

Even if he is, the small-town lawmaker has no where near the distance to fall as history's most famous genital tweeter Anthony Weiner, who lost his U.S. Congress gig and eventually his shot at the New York City mayoralship because of improper posts.

Nowhere near his computer: Parkinson claimed to have been out campaigning when the tweet was posted Monday
