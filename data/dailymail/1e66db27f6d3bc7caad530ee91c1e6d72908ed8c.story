With the aim to win the Premier League for the first time in five years, Chelsea arrived at Burnley with a host of new faces ready to lead a title charge.

Jose Mourinho splashed the cash in the summer, spending £32million on Diego Costa and £30million on Cesc Fabregas.

Mourinho also resigned former Blues striker Didier Drogba on a free and recalled Thibaut Courtois from his loan spell at Atletico Madrid.

But how did the four Chelsea new boys get on? Sportsmail takes a look at the summer arrivals who helped the Blues to a 3-1 win at Turf Moor.

Cesc Fabregas 

It's like Cesc Fabregas has never been away from the Premier League.

The Spain international had spent the previous three years desperately trying to become a key player at Barcelona but he already looked integral to Chelsea within one half of football.

The former Arsenal midfielder assisted Branislav Ivanovic’s goal from a corner, but it was his first-time pass from the edge of the box for Andre Schurrle’s strike which will have Blues fans purring.

It’s already set to go down as one of the passes of the season. Tougher tests lie in wait for the 27-year-old though.

Verdict 9/10

Diego Costa

There’s plenty more to come from Diego Costa, who didn’t have many chances to make his mark on his Chelsea debut. But when they did come, he looked encouragingly sharp.

The striker was first on the scene to convert a rebound and the Blues equaliser after a cross rebounded off the post. While the 25-year-old showed his sharpness to latch on to a woeful back-pass before being unfortunately booked for diving after being brought down by Burnley keeper Tom Heaton.

Up and running: Diego Costa scored on his Chelsea debut and was unfortunate not to win a penalty kick

Well done, lad: Jose Mourinho was pleased with Costa's performance speaking post-match

Better nights will come for Costa to show off his hefty price tag but he already looks well on his way to becoming a fan favourite.

Verdict 7.5/10

Thibaut Courtois

Seen as the long term future for Chelsea by boss Jose Mourinho, but Thibaut Courtois didn’t look it after allowing Scott Arfield’s 14th minute strike to fly past him a little too easily.

That’s perhaps a little harsh on the Belgian making his debut, but the 22-year-old would soon show why he has been given the nod over veteran Petr Cech, denying Arfield’s top corner bound drive later in the game with a superb one-handed stop.

Kicking practice: Thibaut Courtois had little to do on his Chelsea debut in goal

Keeper's ball: But the Belgian looked confident in commanding his box and gathering crosses

It was one of the very few saves Courtois had to make during the game, but the former Atletico Madrid stopper commanded his box well and was not shy in racing off his line to collect a cross. Mourinho’s faith in the keeper looks like it will pay off.

Verdict 7/10

Didier Drogba

Given six minutes to make his mark, it wasn’t going to be the toughest of tests on the 36-year-old legs of Didier Drogba.

But the veteran striker still nearly rolled back the years on his second Blues debut, neatly controlling a long goal kick from Courtois before unleashing a powerful volley just wide with his next touch.

Eye on the ball: Didier Drogba soon got involved with the game despite playing just six minutes

Still got it: Drogba showed flashes of brilliance with a volley which flew just wide

Jose Mourinho at the very least may have just found his ultimate super sub, with the Ivorian looking lively and still showing he has the ability to compete at the top. The stamina test will come another day.

Verdict 6.5/10
