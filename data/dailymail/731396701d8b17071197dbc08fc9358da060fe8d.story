Passenger planes could soon be equipped with Star Wars-style lasers which would shoot down a terrorist's missiles.

Israel's Ministry of Defence has announced that the SkyShield system developed by defence contractor Elbit Systems had successfully completed tests and has been certified for commercial use.

SkyShield uses laser technology and a thermal camera to deflect incoming missiles - after a threat is detected it fires a laser to disrupt the missile's navigation system, taking it off course and detonating a safe distance from the aircraft.

After detecting incoming missiles with an infrared sensor, it fires a laser that disrupts the missile's navigation system

It also operates completely automatically.

The futuristic defence was first ordered in 2002 by the-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon after two shoulder-launched missiles were fired at an Israeli Boeing 757 as it took off from Moi International Airport in Mombassa, Kenya.

The missiles both missed their target and none of the 250 passengers were hurt but the development of SkyShield was ordered as a direct result of the incident.

The project was delayed for several years because of
 infighting among defense firms and government agencies over 
which one would foot the bill.

Once the contract was awarded to Elbit 
Systems, the project was completed in just three years.

'SkyShield has been validated under the 
most complex and sophisticated testing conditions ever conducted in 
Israel and is now ready to protect Israeli airlines,' Israel Air 
Force Brigadier General Eitan Eshel, told wired.com.

The system will now be installed on all El Al airliners but Elbit says it also has contracts with several other countries around the world.

The approval of SkyShield comes just six weeks after another Israeli arms company revealed details of a ground-based laser defense system which can shoot missiles from the sky with a pulse of energy.

State-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems said the futuristic military hardware called Iron Beam was almost ready for deployment.

It works by firing a focused laser at targets which are heated so rapidly they disintegrate in an instant.

The arms maker publicised specifications of its High Energy Laser (HEL) at this week's Singapore Airshow, which is Asia's largest aerospace and defense exhibition.

'It's exactly like what you see in Star Wars,' said company spokesman Amit Zimmer. 'You see the lasers go up so quickly like a flash and the target is finished.'

Countries are vying to weaponise laser technology.

The U.S. Navy announced last year that it will attach a prototype of its Laser Weapons System (LaWS) to USS Ponce and send the amphibious transport docking ship to the Middle East in 2014.

This will be the first time a laser weapon is used in active service.

The blast of infrared energy it delivers can disable a small boat or even take down a drone from above as an impressive Navy video shows.

Navy researchers told reporters that the laser gun, or a 'directed energy pulse weapon' as the military call it, destroyed its targets 100 per cent of the time in testing.

'It operates much like a blowtorch... with an unlimited magazine,' a Navy official said.

The solid-state laser prototype doesn't use up expensive ammunition so is cheap to operate.

'Its weapon round costs about $1 to shoot,' said Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, a Navy researcher.

However, LaWS costs more to build in the first place - at around $32 million per unit.
