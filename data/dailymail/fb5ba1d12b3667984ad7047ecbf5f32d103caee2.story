There's few things in life as satisfying as successfully playing a prank on your sibling.

And Jillian Haker, from the USA, has taken the hobby to new heights after spending a year repeatedly fooling her brother into thinking he was posing for a selfie.

In reality - she actually films him, and her end-of-year montage of the prank has been viewed more than a million times on Youtube.

Prank: Throughout 2014 Jillian Haker fooled her brother into thinking he was posing for a selfie when she was actually shooting a video

The hilarious clip shows her bearded brother falling for the same trick time after time in various locations - pulling ridiculous faces before changing his mind while the video rolls on. 

In each clip he can be seen lurking behind her, sticking his tongue out and saluting the camera by holding up drinks - before realizing his mistake. 

Jillian is hoping her video prank will go viral so that she 'can meet Ellen... Or Taylor Swift' and the footage has already been seen more than a million times.

Underneath her YouTube post, the prankster writes: 'I don't think this trick will ever get old. Best thing I've done in 2014. I love my brother so much!'

2014 was arguably the year of the selfie - with celebrities such as Kim Kardashian leading the way by regularly uploading photos of themselves to social media sites. 

Montage: She then created a video showing various incidences of him falling for the trick, and uploaded the footage to YouTube - it has since been viewed more than one million times
