It has been one of the hottest months on record, with England basking in temperatures in excess of 30C throughout July.

But forecasters are predicting the glorious sunny spells will be replaced by rain as we head into August.

The Met Office has said the unsettled weather will begin in the north and west of England today, with scattered showers set to arrive later on this evening.

The south east has experienced another warm today, with sunbathers heading to Hamsptead Heath in London, but the outlook is more gloomy later on this week, with grey clouds and downpours on the way.

In a stark contrast to last week, the mercury is only set to reach mid to high teens in the north, signalling a start to the drop in temperature.  

The rain will then sweep across the south and east tomorrow as the rest of the UK heads towards an unsettled weekend. 

The showers are expected to continue into next week with long spells of heavy rain in the northwest.

It may be dry for a couple of days at the end of next week, but the rain is then set to carry on throughout the month.

The unsettled weather brings to an end one of the warmest Julys since records began in 1910. July 18 was the hottest day of this year, with the mercury reaching 32.3C in Gravesend, Kent - just short of the 33.6C recorded in Wisley, Surrey, 11 years ago.

However the high temperatures experienced in August of that year - in excess of 38C - will not be replicated in 2014.

Last week several spots in the south east saw more than half of their average monthly rainfall for the whole of July in just one hour.

It caused flash floods, devastating large areas, damaging houses, overwhelming railway stations and stranding residents in their homes.
