A bus driver is being monitored for Ebola symptoms after a passenger traveling on his service told him that he had the deadly virus.

The driver was taken into isolation in Los Angeles, California on Monday after a masked passenger leaned in to him when he boarded the bus and said: 'Don't mess with me, I have Ebola.' 

The man, who was with an unmasked woman, then walked to the rear of the bus while the driver called emergency responders who directed him to continue on his normal route.

A Los Angeles bus was surrounded by caution tape and cleaned by a hazmat team after a man said he had Ebola on Monday on the public transport vehicle

Fire crew hazmat teams were brought in to deal with the bus in LA where a passenger claimed to have Ebola on Monday

A few minutes later, the man threw his mask to the floor and fled the bus. The driver then ordered passengers, who were none the wiser, from the vehicle.  

The incident, which took place on Monday afternoon, was believed to be a hoax but the driver was taken to the hospital as a precaution and the bus cleaned by a hazmat crew. 

The passenger has not been identified but the LA County Sheriff's office told MailOnline today that it is looking at the incident as a possible terror threat and reviewing surveillance tapes.

The man managed to escape from the bus traveling along Venice Boulevard.

The bus driver took the bus to a yard in LA where it was cordoned off and was treated by a crew with hazmat chemicals within a few hours.

The driver was examined at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.

A spokesman from the LA Sheriff's Office on Tuesday told MailOnline that the driver was deemed not to have a temperature or any Ebola symptoms.

The city employee is on paid administrative leave at home but it is unclear whether he will observe the recommended 21-day quarantine period.
