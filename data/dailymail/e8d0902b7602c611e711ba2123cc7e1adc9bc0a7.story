Planes have begun dropping water on forests in Spain in an attempt to put out two raging wildfires which have killed four people, injured more than 100 and forced thousands of residents to stay indoors.

Dash air tankers are collecting water from a reservoir and using it to fight the fires which have devastated large parts of Catalonia, in the north-east of the country.

A teenage girl and her father died after they jumped into the sea from a 165ft cliff in a desperate attempt to escape the blazes.

Wildfires have been raging through north-eastern Spain. Four people have died and 100 others injured as firefighters battled to douse them

Flames forced the French pair, three 
family members, and about 150 other tourists out of their vehicles as 
most were returning home.

The group scrambled down hillsides toward the beach in the Costa Brava town of Portbou, said Deputy Mayor Elisabet Cortaba.

The family of five got separated from
the rest of the group on their way down and ended up at the cliff edge 
with no way out as the fire advanced, fanned by heavy winds.

‘The fire started to close in on them
and they couldn’t climb up or climb down,’ the mayor said, after 
speaking with witnesses. ‘The only way out was to jump into the sea.’

The 60-year-old father died instantly after landing on rocks, and his 15-year-old daughter drowned, she said.

The mother was in a critical 
condition yesterday with a back injury, but the son and other daughter 
did not suffer life-threatening injuries.

Police said the blaze at Portbou was probably sparked by someone throwing a lit cigarette out of a car along a small road inundated by vehicles heading to France.

Two other people were also killed by 
the fires, which have burned across 35 square miles, including one man 
who had a heart attack tackling flames around his home in Llers.

The fires, fanned by strong winds, have caused transport chaos as they swept through parts of Catalonia, 
forcing the suspension of train services in Alto Ampurdan and the 
closure of several cross-border roads linking Barcelona with France.

More than eighty crews attended the fires in ller near La Junquera, close to the Spanish-French border. They struggled to keep them under control

Some 15 other people, including an eight year-old girl, were taken to hospital after they also jumped off the cliff to avoid being burned

Santiago Villa, mayor of Figueres, which houses the famous Salvador Dali museum, said he had ordered the city's 44,000 residents to stay indoors until further notice

More than 140,000 
people in the region have been ordered to remain in their homes and 80 
fire crews have been deployed to fight the fires, which appear to have 
started close to the border with France.

'The
situation on the roads of the area is very complicated,' the fire 
service said in a statement, which added that the main highway linking 
Spain with France through La Jonquera had been closed.

State broadcaster TVE said efforts 
were being made to reach the occupants of cars forced to stop on the 
highway to avoid driving into sections swept by flames.

The fire service said the flames had spread through about 32,000 acres.

The
Spanish Interior Ministry said it had sent three specially equipped 
aircraft and an emergency unit from Zaragoza to aid Catalan 
firefighters.

But the aircraft were being hampered by the high winds.

Spain's
rail company Renfe confirmed that the fires had forced the cancellation
of international high-speed train services linking Catalonia with 
France using the Portbou and Pertus tunnels through the Pyrenees 
mountains.

A
north wind called the Tramontana is commonly seen in mountainous 
northeastern Spain and its strong gusts, which can often exceed 100 mph,
can spread fires rapidly across the heavily forested area.
