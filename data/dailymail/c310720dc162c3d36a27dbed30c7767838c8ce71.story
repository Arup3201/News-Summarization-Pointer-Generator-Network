Black labrador Bob has been saved from bankruptcy after his trust fund was running low because he required medical treatment

A labrador left to a care home by his elderly owner has been saved from bankruptcy after £5,000 was raised to top up his trust fund.

War veteran Harold Pursey left all of his remaining money to pay for his black labrador Bob's on-going care when he died of heart failure in 2010.

His care home in Somerset agreed to adopt the dog when Mr Pursey died and the former butcher's £666 was put into the fund.

But 13-year-old Bob has recently required medical treatment for his stiff joints and racked up big medical bills on acupuncture, hydrotherapy and canine massage.

The funds were running low so staff at Burnham Lodge and nearby residents started to raise money with fundraising events.

The latest event, a fishing competition, raised a staggering £2,000, bringing the total raised to £5,000 and ensuring Bob can continue to live in the lap of luxury.

Judith Alder, who now looks after Bob at the home in Burnham-on-Sea, said: 'We are chuffed to bits, it was absolutely fantastic, we had no idea we would raise that much.

'There was such a huge response to Bob, everybody adores him, we are almost speechless at how much we managed to raise.

'Bob is so lovely and just did what he needed to do, he knew when to turn on the charm.'

Mr Pursey, of Burnham-on-Sea, served with the 12th Lancers tank regiment in France, Belgium and Germany during World War Two.

The lifelong bachelor needed to go into residential care in June 2009 after his health deteriorated due to old age and Lymphedema in his legs.

But he refused to go into a home without Bob, who had been his only companion since getting him as a puppy ten years earlier.

Social worker Judith believed that separating him from the dog 'would have killed' him and set about finding a residential home that would take them both.

Following a lengthy search, the pair settled into Burnham Lodge where Bob became an instant favourite with residents.

He began doing the rounds with nurses as they handed out medication and visited patients.

Staff agreed to sign a contract saying they would adopt Bob when Mr Pursey died in 2010 at the age of 94.

The labrador was left £666 by his owner - who had no more money to his name - which went straight into a trust fund for his care.

Ms Alder said: 'The thing is Bob is getting a bit old and he needs a lot of different things to help him.

'He gets hydrotherapy and acupuncture for his arthritis and he has just started canine massage.

'The poor lad has had his health issues, it is hard to say what we would usually spend on him because it really does vary.

'It is all maintenance though. He had pain killing joint relaxant at £50 a time, his ears need cleaning at £15 monthly, he has joint aid at £70 a month as well.

'He has had a fair few stays in veterinary hospital too.

'The treatment is worth it though, he will have what he wants and needs because everybody loves him and he puts a smile on everybody’s faces, he is very therapeutic.

'He is such a lovely dog, residents love him, everybody that meets him loves him - and he knows it.'
