New Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today struck a tougher tone on criminal policy

Life will be made harder for criminals
in and out of prison to rebuild shattered public confidence in the 
justice system, Chris Grayling pledges today.

In his first newspaper interview as 
the new Justice Secretary, he issues an extraordinary indictment of his 
predecessor Kenneth Clarke’s record, admitting voters do not believe 
justice is being done in many cases.

He said he would make sure jails – 
dubbed ‘holiday camps’ by critics – are no longer seen as places which 
convicts ‘enjoy’, while toughening up community punishments to help 
rehabilitate less serious offenders.

Mr Grayling, whose appointment in 
David Cameron’s Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month has cheered the 
Tory Right, echoed former Tory Home Secretary Michael Howard’s famous 
declaration that ‘prison works’.

In a deliberate break from Mr Clarke’s liberal stance, he declared: ‘I want to be a tough Justice Secretary.’

In a wide-ranging interview, he signalled:

Mr Grayling, who replaced Mr Clarke 
two weeks ago, was brutal in his assessment of the state of the criminal
justice system, suggesting it should always operate as it did following
last summer’s riots – when offenders were dealt with in record time and
punished severely.

Ken Clarke had promised to cut prison numbers when he was Justice Secretary

The minister distanced himself from a 
number of Mr Clarke’s policies, which aimed to slash the number of 
inmates, as the justice department struggles to make savings of 
£2billion.

Mr Grayling said: ‘I’m bringing a 
fresh pair of eyes to the job. I’m very mindful of the need to have a 
criminal justice system in which people have confidence. I think they 
very often don’t have confidence in it.’

However, he was unflinching in his 
commitment to Mr Clarke’s ‘rehabilitation revolution’, saying inmates 
should be both educated and employed while inside.

He said far too many freed criminals 
were ending up reoffending, and suggested paying private firms ‘by 
results’ to help them find jobs.

But he delivered a clear statement that ‘prison works’ – something Mr Clarke stubbornly refused to do.

Mr Grayling, a former Shadow Home 
Secretary, said: ‘Prison is really important. People who commit serious 
offences should go to prison. But I think prison shouldn’t just be about
deterrent. Prison should also turn people round so they don’t keep 
offending again and again.

‘In very many cases, yes, prison does 
work. I don’t think it works well enough. It provides public protection.
It’s important to take serious criminals off the street.’

He said he wanted a tougher regime for
those in custody amid complaints that jails have become too soft, with 
some convicts even having satellite TV in their cells.

Mr Grayling warned: ‘Prison is not 
meant to be a place that people enjoy being in. I don’t [want to] see 
prisoners in this country sitting in cells watching the Sunday afternoon
match on Sky Sports.’

He added: ‘Am I planning to reduce the
number of prison places? No I’m not. I do not want to set a target to 
reduce the prison population. What I do want to do is bring down the 
cost of prison. The whole philosophy I will bring to the department is 
getting more for less.’

He also vowed to tackle the use of mobile phones, which are banned inside prison but widely used, with 800 seized every month.

Mr Grayling said it was vital to bring
an end to what he called social media stalking of victims, adding: 
‘It’s completely unacceptable. I’ve talked to victims of crime who are 
effectively being stalked by the person who attacked them.

‘It is the case that mobile phones are
smuggled into prisons. We have powers to take tough action on that 
front, blocking signals, other ways of clamping down on it.’

Mr Grayling also addressed repeated 
criticism that community punishments are too soft. He said: ‘I want to 
make sure sentences in the community have bite to them. I am not opposed
to punishments taking place outside of prison, but I want to make sure 
they really are punishment and not a diversion.

‘It needs to incorporate a  punitive element.’

We can no longer duck making a decision over giving prisoners the vote, Mr Grayling  warned.

The minister said he was ‘profoundly unhappy’ that Strasbourg judges had ordered the UK to let convicts take part in elections on human rights grounds.

He also criticised the way human rights law had moved ‘way, way away’ from the original intentions of those who drafted the European Convention on Human Rights. But he conceded no significant change was likely while the pro-Europe Lib Dems remained part of the Government.

Successive governments have delayed implementing the prisoner votes ruling, which dates back seven years. The Lib Dems are in favour of criminals voting while Tory MPs are ferociously opposed.

Mr Grayling indicated there are likely to be heated discussions over the issue. But he said: ‘We are going to have to take some decisions. I’m not aware of any means of delaying.’

His job is to produce concrete proposals for the next Tory manifesto. This could include replacing Labour’s Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights.

Teenage knife thugs could face mandatory jail terms after Mr Grayling ordered an immediate review of the law.

And he could further strengthen homeowners’ rights to defend themselves against burglars.

Both moves will be welcomed by Tory MPs, who have clamoured for tougher sentencing, but would face Lib Dem opposition.

The Conservatives were elected on a manifesto promise that anybody guilty of a knife crime should expect a prison sentence.

But, in a controversial move, then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke watered down the commitment.

Currently, four out of five of those convicted of a knife crime do not go to prison.

Mr Grayling said: ‘This is an  area where I continue to have concerns. I am prepared to take action if I need to.’

He also pledged to look again at how best to protect those who come face-to-face with an intruder.

Mr Grayling said: ‘I have been very clear in saying that I believe householders need to be properly protected by the law if they are defending their homes against intruders.’
