More than three quarters of Britons cannot pinpoint major UK cities on a map, a study has found.

An astonishing 85 per cent of respondents failed to locate Sheffield, while the figure was 83 per cent for Birmingham and 76 per cent for Liverpool.

The research, carried out by the Jurys Inn hotel chain, also revealed we struggle to name and locate famous British landmarks - with 36 per cent not knowing where Stonehenge is.

Where am I? An astonishing 85 per cent of respondents to a survey failed to locate Sheffield (above) on map

Most of us can't pinpoint it on a map: The figure was 83 per cent for Birmingham, according to the survey

When shown pictures of iconic landmarks, 39 per cent of Scots did not recognise the St Andrews golf course, while 25 per cent of Londoners could not name 30 St Mary Axe, known as the Gherkin.

The study, which asked more than 3,000 Britons to name cities and identify key landmarks, also found 22 per cent have visited more landmarks abroad than in their home country.

And out of those who are more familiar with foreign sights, 53 per cent have been to Rome, 51 per cent have visited Sydney and 25 per cent have been to San Francisco.

Jurys Inn spokesman Suzanne Cannon said: ‘Brits seem to be falling out of love with Blighty.

‘Instead of wanting to explore more of their local cities and home country, they are being influenced by what they see on TV and in films, to escape abroad.’

She added: ‘The “staycation” may not appeal to everyone, but with a lack of UK knowledge in the first instance, Brits are not necessarily aware of the amazing attractions they could be exploring.’
