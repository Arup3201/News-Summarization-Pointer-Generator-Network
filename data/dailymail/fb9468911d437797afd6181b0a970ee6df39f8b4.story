Thomas Beatie, the transgender man who rose to fame in 2007 when he became pregnant through artificial insemination, has been charged with stalking his ex-wife.

The 40-year-old, who was born a woman and gave birth to three children following a partial sex change, allegedly tracked his former partner, Nancy Beatie,  using a GPS device.

He was arrested last Thursday after a public safety officer spotted the device while helping Ms Beatie fix her flat tire on a freeway in Phoenix, Arizona, according to court records. 

Now, he has been charged with a felony count of stalking Ms Beatie, who has been identified as the 'victim' by the suspect's fiancée, Amber Nicholas, but is yet to be formally named by police.

Beatie, who lives in Anthem, Arizona, was released from Maricopa County Jail on Friday morning, according to TMZ. He will shortly appear in court to answer to the charges. 

Shockingly, in a police interview, Beatie reportedly admitted to putting the GPS device on his ex-wife's car in 2012, explaining how he changed the batteries several times.

He initially activated the device on the vehicle - which he owned at the time - around six months after he served Ms Beatie with an order of protection after claiming she attacker him, it is said.

When Ms Beatie took ownership of the vehicle, Beatie claimed he did not take off the device, but had not monitored it for 'a while', the Arizona Republic reported.

However, Ms Beatie allegedly told police her ex-husband often appeared at places she was at and would ask her where she had been. His knowledge of her movements made her afraid, she said. 

Even if he is convicted of stalking his former spouse, Beatie will not be sentenced to time at the city's Tent City prison - because he is a first time offender, court officials told TMZ.

Instead, he will likely receive probation, it is reported. 

Beatie - who kept his reproductive organs when he had sex-reassignment surgery - married his ex-wife in Hawaii in 2003. The pair have three children, all of whom Beatie gave birth to.

In 2012, the suspect filed for divorce from his partner.

A judge just granted the pair the right to get divorced in August 14 after it had previously been denied as it was not viewed as legal by some courts.

Maricopa County Family Court Judge Douglas Gerlach had ruled that Arizona's ban on same-sex marriages prevented Mr Beatie's marriage from being recognized as valid.

Gerlach said he had no jurisdiction to approve a divorce because there's insufficient evidence that Beatie was a man when he got married.

The judge said the Beaties never provided records to fully explain what Mr Beatie actually had done and not done to become a man.

The ruling also noted that Mr Beatie had halted the testosterone treatments. 

That all changed when Judge Kenton D. Jones said in a 12-page opinion, 'As the Beaties' Hawaii marriage was lawfully entered in Hawaii and is not deemed void by Arizona law, the marriage is valid within this state.'

If their appeal had not gone through, the couple would have been forced to go to Hawaii to get a divorce.
