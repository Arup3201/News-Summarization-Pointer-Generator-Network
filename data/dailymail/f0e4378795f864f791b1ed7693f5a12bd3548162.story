Relatives of Mohammed Emwazi (pictured as a child) say they have been forced to flee their homes for fear of being targeted by reprisal attacks

Terrified relatives of Mohammed Emwazi want to change their identities over fears of revenge at tacks, friends said yesterday.

The jihadi’s parents have gone into hiding and are ‘living in fear’ that they and their children could be targeted by those demanding revenge.

Friends spoke out to defend the family – said to be moderate Muslims who had never supported extremism – fled their home in affluent Maida Vale, West London, before he was revealed to be the terrorist killer Jihadi John, and have not been seen since.

His Kuwaiti parents and their five other children – who the Mail has decided not to name – plan to change their identities to escape his notoriety and believe they will have to start new lives, away from London.

A close friend said: ‘I spoke to his sister and she is devastated. They are having to move, to change their identities. They are going through a very hard time.

‘This [revealing Emwazi’s identity] puts them at risk – they could be attacked by racists – and they have done nothing wrong. It’s not fair.

‘They are a good innocent family. This is not their fault, this [extremism] is not something the family would support in any way. 

'But this is London – you can’t control what your kid does when they are an adult and go out and do their own thing.’

Emwazi was born in Kuwait, where he and his family belonged to the stateless Bidoun group of people of Iraqi origin, who complain they are denied citizenship and full access to education, work and healthcare in the emirate.

His parents decided to move in 1993 when he was six and their two eldest daughters only toddlers, suggesting they were seeking a better education and future for their children in Britain.

At St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school he was the only Muslim pupil in his class.

At secondary school, Quintin Kynaston in St John’s Wood, Emwazi was nicknamed ‘Little Mo’ because of his thin frame and was targeted by bullies from another school.

A former school friend said the gang of 15 and 16-year-olds would wait outside Quintin Kynaston for Emwazi, then 14.

‘They would steal his lunch money and push him around a bit,’ the friend said. ‘He was very quiet and a bit scrawny back then.

'It must have been terrifying for him to have four or five guys ganging up on him like that. He used to be a pretty normal kid, he was religious but in no way radical.

‘Whatever caused him to be what he has become happened after he left school.’

The football-mad youngster was said to have become increasingly strict about observing his Muslim faith as he reached his teens, when his younger sisters also began to wear the hijab.

Yesterday it was claimed Emwazi also featured in the video of the Jordanian pilot Mouath al- Kasaesbeh being burnt alive in a cage by IS last month. 

He is said to have been one of the masked IS fighters cradling their weapons behind the pilot.
