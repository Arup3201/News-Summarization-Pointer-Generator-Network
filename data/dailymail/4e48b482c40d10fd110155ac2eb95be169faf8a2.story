The father of a seven-year-old boy has published an obituary for his son who is actually alive and well.

Jason McCoy reported his son had died in early August at a hospital in Denver, Colorado but now says he is no longer certain his son is dead.

In this bizarre case, the obituary also wrongly named Mr McCoy's girlfriend Bethany Tharp as the boy's mother.

Not dead: Jason McCoy, the father of this seven-year-old published a fake obituary for him, wrongly naming his girlfriend as his mother

Mr McCoy and Ms Tharp submitted the obituary to the Glenwood Springs Post Independent and Ms Tharp also posted on her Facebook page that she was in the process of adopting the boy when he died.

But the first-grader's real mother, Jennifer Stretch, who he lives with in Arapahoe County, Colorado insists the boy is fine and that she is unsure why Mr McCoy would do this.

She said: ‘This has gone too far. They know damn well he is alive.’

Said he was dead: Mr McCoy, right, said his son had died at a Denver hospital in August and girlfriend Bethany Tharp, left, was named as his mother, claiming that she was in the process of adopting the boy when he died

Insists he is alive: His real mother Jennifer Stretch insists the boy is alive and lives with her. She is unsure why Mr McCoy would do this saying 'this has gone too far. They know damn well he is alive.'

Ms Tharp posted updates about the boy’s health mentioning tumours, him being removed from a sterile bubble to an ICU room and then cremated. 

One friend wrote in response: ‘Sorry to hear about your loss’.

The posts have since been removed.

On CBS Denver, the child's mother Ms Stretch said: ‘It's ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous and, you know, I feel like he's (Mr McCoy) gone off the deep end.'

When asked why Mr McCoy would do this, Ms Stretch said: ‘I don't know. I feel like his girlfriend is a part of it.’

Ms Stretch said Mr McCoy had contacted her about the situation and ‘asked me to let it lie, whatever that means, to just leave it alone’.

Since he 'died': The boy was filmed with mother Ms Stretch after he supposedly died. She wants to protect his identity because he is unaware of the incident

The New Castle and Arapahoe County authorities have confirmed that the child is living with his mother, having gone to his school to confirm he was alive and safe, and are investigating the case.

Sgt Julynn Saunders of the New Castle Police Department said: ‘We are currently attempting to ascertain whether a crime has been committed.’

Mr McCoy told the Glenwood Springs Post Independent that he had been informed of his son’s death by someone from the Arapahoe County Human Services Department but Haley McKean, a communication services specialist with the department, said that is not protocol.

She said: ‘Child welfare would never be the ones to reach out to a parent about the death of a child. 

‘That would be up to law enforcement.’

Mr McCoy said he also does not have a death certificate for his son but had been awaiting one from the authorities.

He said: ‘I am calling everybody I can call, backtracking all over. 

‘If he is alive, I would love to see him. I haven't seen him in a month and a half.’

Ms Stretch asked that her son's identity be concealed to protect him because he does not know about the incident.
