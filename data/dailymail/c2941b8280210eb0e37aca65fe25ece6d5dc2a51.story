Former Liverpool target Xherdan Shaqiri is free to leave Bayern Munich this January, according to club president Franz Beckenbauer.

The talented Swiss midfielder has failed to hold down a regular starting berth at the German champions since moving from Basle in the summer of 2012.

And now Beckenbauer has admitted Shaqiri, who has only managed 26 Bundesliga starts for Bayern, can leave the club when the transfer window opens this winter.

Shaqiri revealed Liverpool made a bid for him in the summer but Bayern blocked any move

'Bayern have already sent out a signal and indicated to him that he can probably go in the winter break, when he wants,' Beckenbauer told German channel Sport1.

'I think it's a shame because he is a great talent,' the 69-year-old added.

Shaqiri revealed earlier in the season that Liverpool tried to sign him in the summer, but Bayern blocked any potential deal from materialising.

'Liverpool made a bid for me before the World Cup but Bayern put their foot down and told me, "We’re not going to sell you",' said Shaqiri.

Brendan Rodgers, speaking in a press conference on Tuesday, revealed that Liverpool are not planning on buying anyone in January, but the news that Shaqiri is free to leave Bayern will perhaps change the Liverpool manager's plans.

In the lead-up to his side's Champions League clash with Ludogorets, Rodgers said: 

'It (buying new players) is not something I am looking at. After the weekend, the focus was not to dwell on that. We have to learn from that and try and get a result here.

'I just need to get us back to a level of confidence that allows you to perform. Losing can be the making of you. You learn from it. That is what we are aiming to do.'
