Music industry legend Clive Davis, the man who discovered or signed countless multi-platinum recording artists including Whitney Houston, Bruce Springsteen and Alicia Keys has revealed he is bisexual.

In his new memoir The Soundtrack of My Life, the 80-year-old record executive, who has been married and divorced twice, says he has been involved in two monogamous relationships with men over the past 20 years.

Davis, who has never before publicly addressed his sexuality,  writes that his first sexual encounter with a man was during ‘the era of Studio 54’ in the late '70s.

‘On this night, after imbibing enough alcohol, I was open to responding to his sexual overtures,’ he writes. Prior to that he had only been with women and he writes that being with a man provided ‘welcome relief.’

Davis separated from his second wife in 1985 after a period of ‘soul searching and self-analysis’ and says that he went on to have simultaneous relationships with two women and a man. 

Then in 1990 he entered into a ‘monogamous relationship’ with an unnamed male doctor. That relationship ended in 2004, but Davis says he has been in a relationship with another man ever since.

Davis said his current partner attends 
industry events and travels with him, but he 
declined to reveal his identity in order to protect his privacy.

Speaking to Katie Couric, Davis said that despite his experience with a man in the late '70s he didn't consider himself bisexual until after the end of his second marriage in 1985

Father of four Davis also writes that his coming out deeply affected his ties with one of his three sons, Mitchell.

However after ‘one very trying year’ they managed to work out their differences, he writes.

Speaking on The Katie Couric Show on Tuesday, Davis said that despite his experience with a man in the late '70s, he didn't consider himself bisexual until after the end of his second marriage in 1985.

‘It didn’t affect either of my marriages,' he told Couric. 'But when my second
marriage ended I opened myself up to the possibility that I could have a relationship with a man as well as the two that I had with a woman.’

‘I'm still attracted to women. … You don't have to be only one thing or another. For me, it's the person.’

Davis also hopes that his coming out might lead to a 'greater understanding' of bisexuality.

'I’m not lying,' he told ABC News.
 '[Bisexuality] does exist. For over 50 years I never had sex with a 
male. It wasn’t repressed. I had very good sexual relationships with 
women.'

Asked if he felt ashamed after first sleeping with a 
man, he relied: 'I never felt shame.'

'I felt puzzled. The subject 
of bisexuality really needs much more discussion. It's a status that 
does exist.'

Davis, known as 'the man with the golden ears,' has played a massive role in shaping popular music for well over five decades. He has won five Grammy Awards and is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a non-performer.

His most successful signing, was Whitney Houston, who he discovered and helped mold into one of the biggest selling artists in music history.

Davis devotes an entire chapter in his book, out Tuesday, to working with Whitney. He recalls his trepidations about her acting in The Bodyguard and writes in-depth about the subsequent problems that led to her death.

He reprints a letter he wrote to her after seeing an emaciated Houston perform at the 2001 Michael Jackson tribute concert.

He wrote: 'Dearest Whitney: When I saw you last night at the Michael Jackson concert, I gasped. When I got home I cried. My dear, dear Whitney. The time has come.'

He also reveals that he attempted a one-on-one intervention with her at his upstate New York home, but she wouldn’t listen.

'She was in complete denial,' writes 
Davis. 'I knew that if an addict does not want to get help, there
 ultimately is very little that anyone else can do.'

Davis also recounts the shock of receiving the momentous phone call that Houston was dead. Houston was found dead in the Beverly Hilton hotel in February last year just hours before his annual pre-Grammy party.

He writes: 'There are moments when time stands still, and you feel as if
 you can’t even begin to comprehend the words that are being spoken to 
you. That’s how I felt right then.'

Davis also confirms a story first told by Michael Jackson’s longtime PR man Bob Jones that the deceased singer purposely tried to kill off brother Jermaine’s career.

Jermaine Jackson had a run of hits in the mid-80s while signed to Davis’ Arista label. Clive hired Kenny ‘Babyface’ Edmonds and LA Reid to produce Jermaine’s fourth album, but then Michael signed them up for his own project thus preventing his brother from working with the producers.

‘Jermaine couldn’t believe that Michael, his close brother, would hijack his producers’ material this way,’ writes Clive. He recalls Jermaine was ‘crying, indeed sobbing at times, so deeply hurt that his brother would do this to him.’

The older brother was also so angry 
that he wrote a song called ‘Word to the Badd,’ which denounced Michael 
as shallow and selfish. Michael called Davis up demanding that he take 
the song off of Jermaine’s album.

Davis writes ‘I felt it would be 
wrong for me to tell an artist to take a song off an album. This was a 
family and personal matter that they would need to resolve themselves.’

The book also includes juicy 
behind-the-scenes stories of some of the best known recording artists of
 all time. Davis tells of how Janice Joplin suggested she perform a 
sexual act with him to seal their deal, how John Lennon offered him 
insight into the creative process and the false accusations that ended 
his career at CBS.

The 
autobiography also chronicles his childhood in Brooklyn, the loss of his
 parents when he was still a teen and his scholarship-supported journey 
through New York University and then Harvard Law School.

Clive Davis has had a massive impact on pop music and pop culture for more than 50 years.

After graduating from Harvard Law School he joined Columbia Records Group (CBS) as legal council and soon became president.

One of his earliest pop signings was the British folk-rock musician Donovan, who enjoyed a string of successful hit singles and albums released in the USA on the Epic label.

In June 1967 he attended the Monterey Pop Festival and immediately signed Janis Joplin.

He also signed Santana, Bruce Springsteen, Chicago, Billy Joel, Aerosmith and Pink Floyd.

After Davis was fired from CBS Records for allegedly using company funds to bankroll his son's bar mitzvah he founded Arista Records.

At Arista, Davis signed Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow and Patti Smith.

His most famous signing is Whitney Houston, who he discovered and helped mold into one of the biggest selling artists in music history.

He once said of Whitney: 'You wait for a voice like that for a lifetime.You way for a face like that, a smile like that, a presence like that, for a lifetime. And when one person embodies it all, well, it takes your breath away.'

He founded LaFace Records, home of TLC, Usher and P!nk, with L.A. Reid and Babyface. He also founded Bad Boy Records, home to Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, with Sean Combs.

Davis left Arista in 2000 and started J Records and had continued success with artists including Alicia Keys, Luther Vandross and Rod Stewart.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.He also has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
