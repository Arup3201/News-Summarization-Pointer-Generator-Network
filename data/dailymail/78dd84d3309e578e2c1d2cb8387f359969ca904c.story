A ten-year-old British schoolgirl has been seriously injured after skiing into a tree during a family holiday.

The girl is being treated in hospital after heading down a slope towards a wooded valley in the Austrian resort of Mayrhofen.

She was unable to stop and crashed into the tree at high speed in front of her father and brother during the family's last run of the day.

Witnesses said the girl lost control on the piste near Tirol, in Austria, pictured, before crashing into a tree

Her family gave her emergency first aid at the scene and contacted rescuers who airlifted her to hospital in Innsbruck via the Alpin 5 helicopter.

She was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident but is reported to be in a serious condition.

Witnesses said they saw her head towards an off-piste woodland where she hit the tree at great speed.

A local, who was on the slopes at the time, said: 'I saw a child leave the piste at a very fast speed.

'I 
stopped but was already too far down the slope. I heard a lot of 
screaming. A short while later I saw the helicopter landing at the 
scene. I am told a girl was seriously injured, but I did not see her.

'Many skiers ski too fast. We often hear about accidents. I hope 
the girl recovers.'

The mountain rescue team were called and paramedics also treated her on the slope.

However she was still unconscious when they arrived at hospital, rescuers said.

Mountain rescuers, who were first at the scene, said the schoolgirl is in a very serious condition.

One of the rescuers said today: 'It 
appeared to be a very serious injury. The child was in a bad condition 
when she was taken to hospital. It didn’t look good.

'She suffered head injuries. We treat all head injuries as serious 
especially when children are involved. She was wearing a helmet, which 
will have helped her, but cannot protect from all injuries.

'It was clear
we needed the helicopter to transfer her as quickly as possible.

'Rescuers were at the scene very quickly and she was airlifted to Innsbruck shortly after the accident.'

He said the slope was packed full of skiers as it is 'the busiest time of the season'.

Schools are currently on holiday in Austria and conditions on the piste were said to be excellent.

The town of Mayrhofen in the Zillertal region of Tirol is a popular ski resort amongst British skiers.

It is set about 3,250m above sea level and has 157km of slopes.
