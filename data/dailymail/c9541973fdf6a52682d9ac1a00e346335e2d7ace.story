Three Romanians are behind bars today for running a fake ID racket in Britain which could have entitled illegal immigrants to millions of pounds in state hand outs and free healthcare.

Crime boss Vasile Gheorghe and two accomplices Valentin Babtan and Andreea Necula exploited EU laws on border controls to offer forged Romanian and Italian identity cards and driving licences for up to £2,000 each to migrants hiding out in the UK.

Each fake ID would carry an image of the illegal immigrant, usually with the name and details of unsuspecting Romanian nationals living in Bucharest who would have been legally allowed to move to the UK under the EU's Free Movement of workers programme.

The EU ID cards entitling holders to UK benefits and free NHS treatment were sold mainly to illegal Afghans, Iraqis and Iranians who were smuggled into the UK after fleeing their homelands.

The three suspects were arrested last March following an undercover investigation during which Gheorghe, 39, handed over some of the ID cards to an investigator bragging: 'Romania is now in Europe and cheques can be cashed with the card. 

'The quality is good. It's my job. Somebody with this, they go to Cheque Converters. The cheque was for £2,800. They go with their ID - the fakes - and they take the money.'

Home Office immigration officers raided properties in Eccles, Greater Manchester and Preston, Lancashire seizing a bundle of the fake documents and a quantity of cash.

At Preston Crown Court, Gheorge, of Eccles, and Babtan, 37, and Necula, 28, both of Preston, pleaded guilty to supplying false documents. Gheorghe was jailed for 14 months whilst Babtan got 12 months and Necula 10 months.

Dave Magrath, from Home Office Criminal Investigations, said: 'This case sends a clear message to the gangs involved in this sort of organised criminality - the Home Office crime teams have the skills and resources to track you down.

'Dealing in false documents is a serious offence, whether the motive is to bypass immigration laws, cheat the benefits system or defraud banks.

Those who think they can profit from abusing the system should know that they will be caught.'

The scam began after border restrictions on Romania and Bulgaria were lifted on January 1, allowing nationals of those EU member states full access to the UK jobs market and limited access to welfare benefits in the UK.

Gheorghe, Babtan and Necula used the laws to settle legally in the UK but then began dealing fake ID cards on the black market so illegal immigrants could cash in on the UK welfare system and get access to the NHS.

Their racket was exposed during an investigation by a Sunday newspaper after investigators posing as unscrupulous businessmen held meetings with gang members based in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.

The investigators met Necula who was an 'introducer' and were the shown one of the credit card sized ID documents and told each one was created by a contact in Spain.

Later the investigators met Gheorghe at a house where they were shown many more bogus cards. 

He is said to have boasted: 'This is a Romanian card. I make the ID for you for one year.

'I know someone who used this in a bank to cash a cheque. The bank checked the card with a UV and everything was OK. They are checking the name and the picture and it is OK.'

Police carried out the raids when the investigators collected the fake ID.
