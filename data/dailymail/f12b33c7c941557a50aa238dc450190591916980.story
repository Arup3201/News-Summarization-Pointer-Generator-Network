Former Labor treasurer, Wayne Swan, has released his new book titled The Good Fight

Former Treasurer Wayne Swan gives a scathing account of working with Kevin Rudd, who he describes as 'quick to anger' and difficult to work for, in an explosive new book that reveals why he helped architect the coup that ended Rudd's first stint as Prime Minister in 2010.

Mr Swan also paints an unflattering portrait of Mr Rudd in his book, The Good Fight, describing him as being 'prone to vengeful behaviour' and having an 'unstable personality', as well as his treatment of others as 'juvenile'.

'There was a culture of fear and blame that had its origins in Kevin's temperament,' Mr Swan wrote.

'He was often quick to anger and his outbursts were regularly disproportionate to the matter at hand.'

The memoir goes on to describe a scene in which Mr Rudd caused thousands of dollars of damage to a regional hotel room after he 'snapped a pen in a fit of anger… and dark ink splattered all over the light-coloured décor'.

Mr Swan claimed that Mr Rudd was often prone to such outbursts, which he largely directed at junior staff members, saying: 'The turnover in his office was extraordinary. He burned through staff like a child flicking matches from a box.'

In the book, Mr Swan defends the decisions behind the political scuffle that lead to the demise of Kevin Rudd as Australia's prime minister

But temper tantrums and character problems made up only a fraction of the faults that led to Mr Rudd losing his role as PM in June of 2010 by caucus, according to Mr Swan.

The book also notes the former prime ministers inability to make definitive decisions and manage his cabinet.

Mr Swan wrote that Mr Rudd's constant failure to brief himself appropriately before cabinet meetings, infuriated ministers and wasted their time.

The book also descibes Mr Rudd as having an 'unstable personality' and describes a number of instances when his temper flared

He also claimed Mr Rudd would put too much focus on the media or politics surrounding a problem, 'rather, our priorities should have been about the merits of the policy,' Mr Swan wrote.

The book repeats, time and time again, that Mr Rudd's behaviour was simply impossible to alter and was slowly and clearly leading to his own demise, so much so that he even questioned it himself, asking Mr Swan openly at one stage, 'Are you with me?'.

'Kevin's own behaviour meant that, once the match had been lit, we now had a raging bushfire. It was on,' Mr Swan wrote.

He later added: 'Sadly, Kevin had brought these events upon himself and we now had no choice but to make the best of the situation.'

Mr Swan also takes time in his book to dispel any notion that he himself wished to claim the role of prime minister.

He also describes his on-and-off-again relatiopnship with Mr Rudd who he has known for over 21 years - the two of them becoming close family friends, with Kevin even being named the godfather of Mr Swan's only son.
