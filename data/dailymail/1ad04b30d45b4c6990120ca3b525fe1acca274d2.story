A healthier offering at major fast food chains could help end the obesity crisis in America, a top health and social expert has suggested.

Author David H Freedman believes that to help the poor and obese, mainstream activists should stop slamming processed food altogether and join forces with the fast food industry to encourage healthier menu options.

In an essay for The Atlantic, he says that there is 'no hard evidence' that processed food causes obesity and diabetes.

Mr Freedman also slams the 'let them eat 
kale' attitude of activists, calling the ideas the 'dubious health 
fantasies of a small, elite minority.'

'What percentage of the 
junk-food-eating obese do we want to predict will be ready to drop their
Big Macs, fries, and Cokes for grilled salmon on chard?' he writes.

He
believes that many food activists are out of touch because - like 
himself - they have little in common with the average obese American.

'That person is relatively poor, does 
not read The Times or cookbook manifestos, [and] is surrounded by people
who eat junk food and are themselves obese.'

'Too bad it would largely exclude the obese masses, who would continue and die early,' he writes.

These statements have sparked widespread 
controversy, however, especially among activists like Berkeley professor
Michael Pollan who believe that processed foods are 'evil' and must be 
eliminated in favor of seasonal, 'real' foods.

Food for thought: Mr Freedman has caused controversy with his views on the fast food industry

Mr Freedman believes that, while the 
media has been focused on the evils of processed foods, they have 
ignored the drive by fast food chains to create healthier food options.

Indeed,
Dan Coudreaut, the executive chef and director of culinary innovation 
at McDonald's, says that the debate over processed food has already had 
an impact on the chain's menu.

'Some
want us to have healthier food, but others want us to have minimally 
processed ingredients, which can mean more fat,' he explained.

The company already offers oatmeal and yogurt, and most recently rolled out the Egg White Delight McMuffin - a lower-calorie, less fatty version of the ever-popular Egg McMuffin.

Many media outlets have been critical of such efforts, though, because typically, chains only trimmed 50 to 100 calories per food item.

But obesity scientists confirm that the difference between losing weight and not losing weight is a few hundred calories a day.

At the same time, Mr Freeman points out that that some unprocessed 'health' foods are bigger calorie bombs that their fast food counterparts, with 'obscene quantities of fat and problem carbs'.

'Per 100 calories, tofu is as fatty as many cuts of beef,' he writes.

Mr Freeman found that a Whole Foods Vegan Cheesy Salad booster with spirulina, chlorella and raw sea vegetables, contains more than three times the fat content  - and four times the sodium - of the beef patty in a Big Mac.

He adds that Trader Joe's 'Inner Peas', (peas that are fried in sunflower oil), have six times as much fat as protein as the fast food treat.

Mr Freedman's article has sparked widespread backlash. Forbes compares him to Paula Deen and slams his 'racially and class insensitive cover story'. Salon writes that he 'gets absolutely everything wrong about processed food and Americans' health', and Mother Jones calls his framework 'too simplisitic'.

University of Illinois 
professor Lisa Powell also disagrees. She believes that it is the 
government's responsibility to address 'food deserts', where communities
lack access to fresh produce and must instead rely on fast food.

'If
the government came into these communities and installed Brita filters 
under their sinks, they’d drink water instead of Coke,' she said.

'What percentage of the 
junk-food-eating obese will be ready to drop their
Big Macs, fries, and Cokes for grilled salmon on chard?'

But Kelli Drenner, an obesity researcher at Stephen F. Austin State University, agrees with Mr Freedman. She says low-income communities 'won't eat broccoli instead of french fries.

'You try to make even a small change to school lunches, and parents and kids revolt,' she points out.

Ironically, fast food companies often keep healthy changes under the radar.

'People expect something to taste worse if they believe it’s healthy,'  says Charles Spence, an Oxford University neuroscientist who specializes in how the brain perceives food.

'And that expectation affects how it tastes to them, so it actually does taste worse.'
