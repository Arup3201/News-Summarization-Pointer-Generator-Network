They are renown for their doom-laden lyrics about Satan and slaughter.

Now the rock band Megadeth's front man is speaking out about something else close to his heart - the delivery policy at Men’s Wearhouse.

Angry (Front)man: Megadeth singer Dave Mustaine (pictured) penned a Facebook-borne tirade that is making the rounds on the Internet

Mustaine's rant concerns Men's Wearhouse's failure make good on its advertised two-day delivery policy

Tardy X-Mas Gift: M.W. apparently was still yet to deliver a gift card Mustaine bought at a Salt Lake City, Utah shop nine days after he purchased it

I Guarantee It: Mustaine ironically quotes Men's Warehouse's slogan in his Internet diatribe concerning the chain's failure to live up to a two-day delivery policy

Singer Dave Mustaine took to Facebook to lambast the suit chain for failing to make good on its promise of a two-day delivery.

He ordered a gift card for his tour manager, but when it failed to arrive he went online to rant.

Mustaine wrote: ‘I really think that it sucks when people make false claims, that they don't care to make good on a problem that is clearly their fault, and with all of the 'ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE IT' crap I just had to say something.'

Mustaine bought the gift card at a Men’s Wearhouse in Salt Lake City, Utah, before Christmas as a gift for his tour manager Jim Carroccio, but nine days later it still had not turned up in the post.

Mustaine wrote: ‘I know that not all of you have the kind of job that requires a suit, or wear a suit when you (if you) go to any kind of faith-based service, court date, wedding or funeral, but if you do…you are going to want to read this.

‘You know me, I don’t complain much in writing, but I gotta get this off my chest.’

In the Facebook post Mustaine added that when he called up Men’s Wearhouse they made no effort whatsoever for this mix-up’.

He wrote: ‘We are all living in very tight financial times right now, and like I said, you may not wear a suit for your job or for an event or occasion, but if you do, I would strongly recommend you wear someone else’s suits.

‘Go to Jos. A Bank instead. I for one, will never set foot in a Men’s Wearhouse, even for shelter from a blizzard.’

In a sign that thrash metal fans clearly value their customer service, Mustaine’s post was liked 8,900 times and shared 600 times.

Most fans were behind Mustaine but some thought that his interest in suits was somewhat at odds with his public image.

Where's My Gift?: Mustaine purchased the gift card from Men's Wearhouse as a Christmas gift for his tour manager, JimCarroccio (pictured)

A Suggested Alternative: Mustaine told his legions of fans to not only eschew Men's Wearhouse, but shop instead at its competitor, JoS. A. Bank

Fan Ralph Hannaberry wrote: ‘I think Dave should do a nationwide tour and play in front of every Mens Warehouse outlet in America complete with headbanging groupies and Justin Bieber as an opening act just to annoy the crap out of the establishment!’

Rocker Adam Cirucci wrote: ‘Dude, i have to say you are 100 percent RIGHT ON....MENS WEARHOUSE sucks terribly.

‘Got my tuxes for my wedding there. They never cleaned mine and I ended up smelling like p*** on my wedding day’

Megdeth's Mustaine was once a member of Metallica, but was ejected from the popular band because he threw a punch at its front man, James Hattfield

Megadeth fan Aprillynn Danzig Devila added: ‘HAPPY 2013 YEAR TO YOU DAVE!!!! LOL F*** THE SUITS JUST BROOM STICKS AND WITCHES BREW!!’

Mustaine is known for his strong views and was kicked out of Metallica in 1983 for punching bandmate James Hetfield.

A Men’s Wearhouse staff member eventually wrote to him on Facebook and promised to make amends.

The staff member, called Joe wrote: ‘Dave, thanks for reaching reaching out to us on Facebook.

‘We apologize for the delay in receiving your gift card and agree that the delay is unacceptable.’
