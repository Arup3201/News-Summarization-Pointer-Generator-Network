The chance to test their mettle against the best is what attracts players and managers to the Champions League. But for one young coach who has already reached the promised land, it was the second tier of English football that provided his steepest learning curve.

'The Championship is really, really difficult!' Basle manager Paulo Sousa tells Sportsmail. 'Coaches who don't have that experience cannot realise how difficult it is.

'The standard of the players is more or less the same. It makes it very competitive right through the season. You can see in the way teams' positions change throughout the season, from the bottom and the top of the league. And the dreamland – the Premier League – is so, so close!

'I learnt a lot in that league. There were some points where I was not prepared enough, but you gain experience by doing, not just watching or listening.

'It's like jumping into a swimming pool at the deep end. You can see how to do it from the side, but you will never learn unless you jump in.'

And jump in is precisely what Sousa did seven years ago when he left the safety of the Portugal junior set-up to become the face of Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone's project at Queens Park Rangers.

Taking the reins under a couple of Formula One moguls with a four-year plan to reach the top flight might seem like a daunting prospect for a debutant manager, but not for Sousa.

'Nothing is too soon. I will always be thankful to Briatore. All the difficulties I got through at that club and all the demands he made of me gave me the opportunity to grow. It was so demanding on a daily basis – 24 hours every day from the first day I arrived there.'

But what of Briatore's notorious habit of involving himself in managerial decisions? 'He tried. But I always fight for my convictions.'

Basle manager Paulo Sousa says the Championship is a highly competitive league

Sousa's first job in club management was with Queens Park Rangers between 2008 and 2009

It is widely believed that these convictions - a refusal to act merely as Briatore's touchline proxy - are what saw Sousa ejected from the Loftus Road hotseat after just 26 games in charge. The two-time Champions League winner would get a second chance at Championship success just two months later though, taking over from Roberto Martinez at Swansea in June 2009.

Under chairman Huw Jenkins, Sousa was given time to get his ideas across, and a subsequent seventh-placed finish – the club's highest for 27 years – showed it was time well spent. But the manager's progress hadn't gone unnoticed, and when moneybags Leicester came calling, Sousa couldn't resist.

It quickly transpired that swapping the Mumbles for the Midlands was a mistake – Sousa was sacked after less than three months in charge – and the former Portugal international readily admits to a lapse of judgment in that summer of 2010.

The Portuguese coach also had a spell in charge of Welsh side Swansea City between 2009 and 2010

During his playing career, Sousa also spent time with Greek giants Panathinaikos between 2000 and 2001 

'When I left Swansea, my ambition pushed me to take decisions in the direction of better infrastructures, better club history and higher prospects to reach the Premier League.

'Instead of seeing the whole forest, I saw only the beautiful tree in front of me. Swansea has lots of beautiful trees, but at that moment I didn't recognise that. That I regret.'

That season, with Sousa clubless, Swansea were promoted to the Premier League under the guidance of Brendan Rodgers. Sousa insists it was not difficult to see his former club achieve what he narrowly missed out on the previous year. Instead he looked back fondly on his time there, though not everyone at the club regards the Sousa era with such nostalgia.

Then captain and now manager Garry Monk has since released an outspoken autobiography in which he claimed Sousa's spell at the club had been a 'wasted season' and he was 'glad we didn't get into the play-offs as he did not deserve to be the one to take us to the Premiership'.

These comments resonated with Sousa: 'Look, he's a person I want to succeed, like everyone. But unfortunately he said things about me and I don't appreciate people talking about somebody when they don't have the courage to say it up front.

'He is well integrated in the club, but the key for success at Swansea is the leadership of Jenkins and the support of the board members, not one manager.'

Current Swansea manager Garry Monk played under Sousa and is very critical of his former boss

Indeed, if Sousa did not deserve promotion with Swansea, few could argue that five years later, after negotiating a group containing Real Madrid and Rodgers' s Liverpool side, he hasn't earned the right to fight for a place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

Going toe-to-toe with Rodgers – whom he describes as 'a top coach and a top person' – was a satisfying narrative. But for Sousa, now 44, travelling to Anfield knowing the winner would reach the last 16 was all the motivation he needed.

'I love the challenge. To play against the best gives us the possibility to become better.

'Liverpool are an important club who invest lots of money on players, but they were beaten by Basle. Basle didn't just defend and look for an opportunity to counter, Basle wanted to be the protagonist. Basle deserved to go through.'

On Tuesday, all that stands in between Basle and a first European Cup quarter-final since the playing days of Ottmar Hitzfeld is a formidable Porto side. After a 1-1 draw in the home leg two weeks ago, Sousa admits it's a tall order.

'I always think we have a chance to win, but we recognise their superior quality. They didn't lose one game in the group stage, and they've only lost three all season.

'We compete with what we have and my players are proud of what they've done. They are ambitious and courageous, and this gives us the possibility to achieve magical nights.'

And should the Estadio do Dragao bare witness to another of Basle's magical nights, who does Sousa have his eye on in the last eight? Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, perhaps?

'It would be amazing for our club. He is one of the best coaches in the world. Some people love him, some people don't love him – but his record will always be there.

'I'm really proud of all the Portuguese coaches abroad. Their success feels like my success because I know how difficult it is to do well in a foreign country!'

He certainly does, and with Basle seven points clear at the top of the Swiss Super League and rubbing shoulders with Europe's elite, he looks to have well and truly overcome those difficulties. But is it only a matter of time until, once again, the ambitious Sousa tries his luck across the English Channel?

‘My near future is all about what I am doing now in this club. I'm not predicting I'll be in England one day, but I know I could make the Premier League some day in the future.’
