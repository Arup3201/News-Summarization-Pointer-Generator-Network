From powered exoskeleton races to competitions using brain power, the first ever Olympics for bionic athletes will take place in Switzerland in October 2016.

The Cybathlon will include races for competitors wearing prosthetic limbs and exoskeletons as well as a powered wheelchair obstacle course and a competition where people control an avatar using their mind.

As well as enabling bionic athletes to compete together, the Cybathlon is designed to boost interest in performance-enhancing technology used by humans.

From powered exoskeleton races to competitions using brain power (illustrated), the first Olympics for bionic athletes, called the Cybathlon, will take place in Switzerland in October 2016

Some of the technology that will be put through its paces by athletes has previously been excluded from the Paralympics.

The event, which will be hosted by the Swiss National Competence Centre of Research (NCCR) will include a race for competitors who are paralysed from the neck down, where they control an avatar in a computer game using a headset that links their brain to the computer.

‘The competitions are comprised by different disciplines that apply the most modern powered knee prostheses, wearable arm prostheses, powered exoskeletons, powered wheelchairs, electrically stimulated muscles and novel brain-computer interfaces,’ the NCCR said.

The wearers of the assistive devices will be known as pilots and the technology they use can be available commercially or developed for them as a prototype in a lab.

Pilots with leg amputation will be equipped with machine operated prostheses and will have to successfully complete a race course (pictured) as quickly as possible, which will include obstacles such as slopes, a staircase, cobblestones and a seesaw

In the Powered Exoskeleton Race (pictured), pilots with complete thoracic or lumbar Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) will be equipped with actuated exoskeletal devices, which will enable them to walk along a particular race course

In a slightly similar way to Formula One, both the pilot and company that has developed the device will receive a medal at the event at the Hallenstadion Zurich.

While prosthetic limbs are becoming increasingly advanced, there is often a disconnect between patients and the technology they use, according to Professor Robert Riener, the organiser of the event from the University of Switzerland.

Pilots with forearm or upper arm amputations will be equipped with actuated exoprosthetic devices and will have to successfully complete two hand-arm task courses as quickly as possible (illustrated). A close-up camera view will be used to life-display the shoot on the stadium screens. At least two participants will start at the same time on two identical courses, to make the event more exciting

‘The idea is that we want to push development of assistive technologies towards devices that patients can really use in everyday life,’ he told the BBC.

‘Some of the current technologies look very fancy but are a long way from being practical and user-friendly.’

The Powered Wheelchair Race (illustrated) will allow pilots with different disability levels (e.g. quadriplegics, paraplegics, amputees) to be equipped with power wheelchairs, which will enable them to steer along a particular race course. The course will be defined by cones between which the pilots will have to manoeuvre the chair both forward and backward. In addition, obstacles of different sizes will be used

Pilots with arm amputations will be equipped with robotic prostheses and will have to successfully complete two hand-arm task courses as quickly as possible, including a course where they try not to touch a wire with a metal hoop (pictured)

Powered arm prostheses race: Pilots with arm amputations will be equipped with robotic prostheses and will have to successfully complete two hand-arm task courses as quickly as possible.

One of the challenges will see pilots holding a wire loop which they will use to navigate a metal wire without touching it. Another race will see participants pick up differently shaped objects in order to demonstrate the dexterity of their prostheses.

Brain computer interface race: Pilots will be equipped with technology that lets them control an avatar in a racing game played on computers using their brains. They will race along a track with obstacles.

Functional electrical stimulation bike race: Pilots with spinal cord injuries will use functional electrical stimulation devices, which will enable them to perform a pedaling movement on a cycling device that drives them on a circular course. There will be two categories - a sprint race, over a distance of 200metres and an endurance race over the distance of 1000metres.

Powered leg prostheses race: Pilots with transfemoral amputation will be equipped with machine operated prostheses and will have to successfully complete a race course as quickly as possible, which will include obstacles such as slopes, a staircase, cobblestones and seesaw.

Powered exoskelton race: Pilots with spinal cord injuries (SCI) will use powered exoskeletons to negotiate a race course with obstacles of around 100metres.

Powered wheelchair race: Participants will use powered wheelchairs to steer along a race course with slopes and uneven surfaces as well as a slalom.

In one of the six disciplines at the games, participants will use powered wheelchairs to steer along a race course with slopes and uneven (illustrated) surfaces as well as a slalom
