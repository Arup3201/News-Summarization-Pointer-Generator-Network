Timeless children’s favorite ‘Sesame Street’ - home to Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, and Elmo - is to start teaching young children about how to cope when their mom or dad is incarcerated.

The long-running PBS children’s education show launched the ‘Little Children, Big Challenges: Incarceration’ educational program earlier this week.

Organizers say the campaign is aimed at helping kids aged three to eight in the U.S., which has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

A toolkit of resources has been uploaded onto the Sesame Street website including videos, printable brochures, eBooks and apps.

‘The incarceration of a loved one can be very overwhelming for both children and caregivers,’ reads a message on the website. ‘Here are some tools to help you with the changes your child is going through.’

The kit includes a video showing two Muppets - Abby the fairy and lovable monster Rosita - dealing with a Muppet boy who shamefully admits that his father can't help him build a toy car because he’s in jail.

Then a woman called Sofia tells the boy that she knows what he’s going through because her dad was in jail when she was his age.

As well as the online resources, information packs will be distributed to schools, community centers and jails

The online materials include a variety of 'tips¿ for how to prepare young child for visiting a parent in prison

The online materials include a variety of 'tips’ for how to prepare young child for visiting a parent in prison.

'Before you visit your incarcerated loved one, let your child know some of the things she can expect to happen. For instance, "We won’t be able to sit in the same room with Mommy, but we can see her through a window and read a story together."'

Another tip focuses on explaining to a child how they might explain the situation to other people.

'When explaining where an incarcerated parent is, you can say, "Daddy is in a place called prison (or jail) for a while. Grownups sometimes go to prison when they break a rule called a law."'

money is involved in this program, although the website lists a series 
of corporate sponsors including BAE Systems.
