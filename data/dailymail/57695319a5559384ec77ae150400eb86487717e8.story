Tragedy: Georgia Hedges, 14, died two days after being found hanged at home in Witham, Essex

Hundreds of friends and loved ones have today paid tribute to a 'beautiful' and popular teenager who appears to have killed herself.

Georgia Hedges was found hanged in Witham, Essex, on Tuesday last week and died on Thursday.

The 14-year-old had been rushed to a specialist unit at Adenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, but could not be saved.

A shrine covered with notes, pictures and surrounded by flowers has been started at her school,  Maltings Academy in Witham.

An inquest into Georgia's death was today opened by Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray.

Coroner's officer Philip Sitch said: 'On May 14, she was found at home suspended by a ligature.

'An ambulance was called. Extensive resuscitation was carried out and she was transferred to Adenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge where she died on the morning of May 16.

'A post-mortem examination was carried out by Dr Nat Carey who confirmed cause of death as hypoxic ischaemic brain damage following a cardiac arrest with evidence of a compression of the neck consistent with hanging. 

'Police enquiries are being conducted to try to ascertain the circumstances leading up to this tragic event.'

Hundreds of Georgia's friends have paid tribute to her on Facebook.

Caitlin Overton wrote: 'We wish you were here - rocking' up to school one hour late, brushing your beautiful hair.

'We all love you so much, you are always in our thoughts and hearts and you will never be forgotten.

'Sleep tight beautiful princess, the brightest star in the sky! We love you.' 

Upsetting: A shrine to Georgia has appeared at her school, Maltings Academy in Witham, where principal John Szynal and vice principal Damian Lee, read the tributes

Outpouring: Bereft staff and students at her Witham school have called Georgia a bright and beautiful teenager, as cards and picture line the corridor there

Stunned pupils and parents were told of the teenager's death last week in a letter sent home by the principal, John Szynal.

He wrote: 'She [Georgia] was a popular student, well-liked and respected by students and teachers.

'People are dealing with the grief in different ways and I have drafted in a group of professional counsellors to support students and staff.'

Police were called to Georgia's home last Tuesday after she tried to hang herself.

Paramedics and an air ambulance also attended at about 6pm and Georgia was rushed to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital by air ambulance being she was then transferred.

An Essex Police spokesman confirmed officers were continuing to investigate the cause of death.

He said: 'A post-mortem was carried out on Friday and a provisional cause of death has shown the girl died of compression of the neck.'
