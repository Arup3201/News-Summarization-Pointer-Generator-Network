Wayne Rooney thanked David Moyes on Friday night for salvaging his Manchester United career after signing a new five-and-a-half year deal at Old Trafford worth £300,000-a-week.

Rooney told United he wanted to leave last summer following a spectacular fall-out with Sir Alex Ferguson, and the Barclays Premier League champions were forced to fight off bids of up to £30million from Chelsea.

Moyes revealed on Friday how he 
persuaded the England striker to stay at Old Trafford during a secret 
meeting in June by challenging Rooney to prove that he has not ‘gone a 
bit soft’.

And Rooney paid 
tribute to his old Everton boss after signing a new deal until June 2019
 that makes him the highest-paid player in English football.

He said: ‘There was a lot of speculation in the summer but I was pleased when David Moyes came in to the club.

‘I’ve
 got a great relationship with him and he’s shown a lot of trust and 
faith in me. Talks have been ongoing for a long time – I’m delighted to 
be signed up now.

‘This is 
one of the biggest clubs in the world and to know that I will be playing
 here for the majority of my career is something that I’m looking 
forward to. I’m happy that everything is now finalised and I can carry 
on concentrating on my football.

The man: Rooney's deal will run out in 2019, but he will become a club ambassador when he retires

All smiles: Wayne Rooney has signed a new £300,000-a-week at Manchester United

‘I’ve
 been here since I was 18 and this contract will take me through to my 
thirties, which is almost my entire professional career. I’ve played 
most of my best football here and am looking forward to hopefully 
playing even better football in the next few years.’

Rooney
 insisted that the possibility of United missing out on Champions League
 football next season did not deter him from committing the rest of his 
top-flight career to the club, instead pointing to the £37million 
signing of Juan Mata as proof of better times ahead at Old Trafford.

‘It’s
 not a massive concern for me,’ he added. ‘This is because I know the 
direction that this club is going in, and if we don’t make it this 
season then we will come back stronger and claim a Champions League spot
 next season.

‘The future is
 bright for Manchester United. This is still one of the world's leading 
clubs, and we have seen this with the signing of Juan Mata.

‘People
 have been saying that we may have trouble attracting the world’s best 
players but I think the fact Mata came here shows this isn’t true.

Tell-tale: Rooney referenced the capture of Mata as proof that United can still sign the best players

‘This
 is a new era for the club. We have a new management team and a great 
new manager in David Moyes – there has to be some time for change.

‘We
 have some great players here and despite our recent form everyone has 
stuck together and the team spirit is still good. We will continue to 
work hard and get Manchester United to the top where it belongs.’

Persuading
 Rooney to stay represents Moyes’s greatest victory as United manager so
 far. On Wednesday night he insisted that the club were always in control of 
the situation despite the speculation surrounding Rooney’s future last 
summer.

‘As far as I was 
concerned it was never in doubt,’ said Moyes. ‘The way I looked at it, 
this football club was never selling Wayne Rooney. Never.

‘The one thing I’ve found about Manchester United is that they decide what players go when they want them to go.

‘The players won’t control that no matter who comes to the club. The club will always be in control of that.’

The
 new deal is also expected to mean that Rooney succeeds Nemanja Vidic as
 captain next season, although Moyes said that the decision will not be 
made until the summer.

He 
revealed that he met Rooney in secret on two occasions before starting 
his new job last July after the striker had been frozen out by Ferguson.

Thumbs up! The deal is thought to be for five-and-a-half years, representing a massive win for David Moyes

Improvement: Rooney has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season, and has improved in all areas

1. Sir Bobby Charlton (1953-73) - 249 goals in 758 appearances

2: Denis Law (1962-73) - 237 goals in 404 appearances

3: Jack Rowley (1937-55) - 211 goals in 424 appearances

4: Wayne Rooney (2004 - present) - 208 goals in 430 appearances

5: George Best (1963-74) - 179 goals in 470 appearances

Moyes
 added: ‘I said to Wayne that I wanted him to stay before I’d actually 
come in here. I’d met Wayne privately a couple of times to talk about 
his situation, to try to understand.

‘He
 came up to my house and I said to him, “if you ask me what’s missing I 
think you’ve gone a bit soft”. I thought he hadn’t been the 
hard-working, aggressive player he was. I needed to try to get him back 
to that level.

‘When he came
 into the team I felt as though he nearly had to re-invent himself 
again. Go back to being the old Wayne Rooney, fighting for everything 
that’s there but with the technical ability of a top player.

‘I
 think he’s done that. He’s back, he’s showing leadership qualities and 
he’s shown exactly what it is to play for Manchester United.

‘I’ve
 heard people saying he wouldn’t be here at different times but, as you 
know, football deals don’t get done quickly now. I’ve probably known for
 three or four months that this would probably happen. In fact, I’ve 
felt it since August.’

Moyes
 was in charge at Everton when Rooney signed his first professional 
contract, and admitted that there was ‘a bit of déjà vu’ when they posed
 for photographs on Friday.

Despite
 a poor first season in charge, Moyes believes that Rooney’s decision to
 sign a new contract is a clear sign that he trusts the Scot to be a 
success at United and attract some of the world’s top players to Old 
Trafford.

‘I always felt some day our paths would cross again and they have,’ said Moyes.

‘He
 knows by the way I train, by the way I work, by my determination to 
succeed that I won’t allow this to go the way it is. I'll make changes 
if it doesn’t improve.

Secured: Moyes has drawn the very best out of Rooney this season, but his future had been in doubt still

‘I 
said to you as well, and you’ll get to know when I say it I mean it, 
that we’d be in for all the best players in the world – and that hasn’t 
changed.

‘All the top 
players want to play for Manchester United. I can’t tell you the amount 
of phone calls I’ve had from top players around the world who want to 
play for Manchester United.’

Now
 Moyes believes that Rooney can go on to achieve legendary status at Old
 Trafford and elevate himself alongside United greats like George Best 
and Sir Bobby Charlton.

‘To 
be a legend at Manchester United it is something where you are 
associated with this club for the rest of your life,’ he said.

‘For Wayne, I think he’s recognised people like Bobby Charlton George Best and the way those big stars are seen here.

Main man: The England striker has been a standout for the Reds this season in trying circumstances

‘Wayne’s next thing is that we have to keep challenging him to get those goals and make those big targets.’

In
 order to make sure that he gets the most out of the remaining years of 
his career, it has been agreed that United’s commercial department will 
take over the handling of his endorsement contracts from now on.

For
 example, Rooney’s deals with companies like Nike and Samsung will now 
become the responsibility of the club, meaning that the England striker 
will now have one of the biggest football clubs on the planet 
effectively working on his behalf to maximise his earnings.

It had looked as if the 28-year-old would be leaving for pastures new last summer, with Chelsea keen to land the England man.
