This is the hilarious video showing rude images and angry messages hidden in a city’s Christmas lights that has gone viral online.

But it turns out that the footage of Brighton city centre - which appears to show pictures of lewd acts and messages such as ‘I Hate My Job’ - is a creative spoof posted by satirical website The Poke.

The lights are put up by a group of companies in the city called the Business Improvement District at a cost of around £100,000 every year - but it confirmed to MailOnline that the video was a ‘hoax’.

Spoof: The lights are put up by a group of companies in the city called the Business Improvement District at a cost of around £100,000 every year - but it confirmed to MailOnline that the video was a 'hoax'

Joke: The video was posted on The Poke under the heading: 'There's a problem with Brighton's Christmas lights'. The website suggested that it was the work of an angry electrician who installed the lights

BID manager Gavin Stewart said the video had caused quite a stir, but added: ‘It is a prank, it’s a hoax. They don’t look like that in real life. It’s a funny thing. We’re taking it as tongue in cheek.’

Brighton & Hove City Council leader Councillor Jason Kitcat described the video, which was published yesterday and has had hundreds of views, as ‘good news for the city and good news for its traders’.

Councillor Kitcat added: ‘The video is a creative spoof, but it is making people smile and getting thousands of people talking about Brighton & Hove in the run up to Christmas.

A fake: It turns out that the footage of Brighton city centre which appears to show pictures of lewd acts and messages such as 'I Hate My Job' is a creative spoof posted by satirical website The Poke

‘The lights are paid for and put up by local traders through the Business Improvement District, not the council. I'm sure they will be delighted at the extra publicity at their busiest time of the year.’

Twitter users praised the video, with most realising it was fake. Jamie Smart described it as 'fantastic', Gabriel Bisset-Smith called it 'genius' and Aaron Wood said: 'You have to watch this now'.
