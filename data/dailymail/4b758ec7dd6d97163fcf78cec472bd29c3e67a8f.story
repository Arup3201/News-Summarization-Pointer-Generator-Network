A search has been launched for a couple and four young children who failed to return from the mountains in northwestern Nevada after heading there to play in the snow on Sunday

James Glanton, 34, his girlfriend Christina McIntee, 25, and the four children, a 10-year-old, two four-year-olds and a three-year-old, headed to Seven Troughs at noon in a 2005 Jeep.

But the group failed to return and a search and rescue mission was launched shorty after 8pm and continued through most of the night. It was resumed in sub-zero temperatures this morning.

Missing: James Glanton, 34, and Christina McIntee, 25, (pictured left and right) failed to return home with four of their children on Sunday night after heading out to play in the snow

Rough terrain: They are missing with four children, aged 10, four, four and three, authorities said

The relationship between the couple and the children was unclear.

They were driving a silver Jeep with a black top. It remains unclear what supplies they might have been carrying or whether they were able to communicate with rescuers.

Dispatcher Jerry Reid said that Pershing County deputies are working with a Navy search and rescue team to find the group and may also bring in the Civil Air Patrol.

The situation is especially urgent due to unseasonably cold temperatures in the area.Â

In nearby Lovelock, temperatures dipped 
to 16 below zero early Monday, National Weather Service Meteorologist 
Mark Deutschendorf said.

In photos MCIntee has shared on Facebook in recent weeks, land surrounding her home has been blanketed with thick snow.

If you know anything or have seen the group, you are urged to call the Pershing County Sheriff's Office at 775-273-2641.

Biting: The area is covered in snow and suffering sub-zero temperatures, making the search urgent
