On first impressions, it looks like a regular gift shop, with T-shirts, baseball caps, key chains and beach towels on sale for thousands of tourists.

But take a look closer and you will realise this is no ordinary gift shop, but one with a macabre twist.

For one it is inside the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner - which has investigated some of history's most famous deaths, including Marilyn Monroe and Bobby Kennedy.

The only coroner's department in the world to have a gift shop, the shelves are stacked 
with a range of bizarre death-themed keepsakes, from water bottles marked with 
'bodily fluids' to boxer shorts labelled 'undertakers'.

Dead good: A 'Coroner' t-shirt on sale for $27.50 is one of the shop's best sellers

'Don't drink and drive' coasters are on sale at Skeletons in the Closet gift shop

Other useful gifts include mouse mats, complete with a chalked outline of a body, and a suitcase in the shape of a
body bag.

There is even a coffin-shaped couch and the shop's bestseller - a towel, priced at $30, again with eye-catching corpse detail on it.

Opened on the back of some of history's 
most famous deaths, the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner started
the Skeletons In the Closet Gift shop in 1993.

But now it seems business is literally dying too - as the shop is losing about $50,000 a year.

It initially opened with the aim of funding anti-drink-driving courses for teenagers, which included a trip to the mortuary.

The idea was to promote how fragile life is and 
create awareness and responsibility towards your actions. 

But now the store is being propped up by the very course it was meant to support, according to The Times.

Chief coroner investigator Craig Harvey told newspaper: 'We're in a bit of a slump.'

Famous corpses who have passed through the doors of the mortuary include Bobby Kennedy 
following his assassination in 1968, the 'probable suicide' of Marilyn 
Monroe, and just two years ago the drug-induced death of Michael Jackson,
which held the headlines for days.

The Department investigates about 20,000 fatalities a year as well as dozens of post mortems each week.

It is believed to be the only coroner's department in the world with an active gift shop.

Other items for sale include a foot label pin for $5, a welcome mat with a corpse outline on it for $25 and an apron with the words LA Coroner has Love' for the same price.
