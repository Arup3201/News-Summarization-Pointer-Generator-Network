A college basketball contest was repeatedly delayed Saturday by - of all things - a swooping bat that inexplicably gained entree into the arena and then again-and-again dive-bombed the court.

Pandemonium erupted at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin during the game's second half after the flying critter emerged from the building's rafters and reportedly proceeded to harry panicked players and coaches with repeated kamikaze-like swoops.

'It's coming back! It's coming back!' a fan can be overheard exclaiming to a pal on a widely-circulated YouTube video of the incident.

Unexpected guest: A college basketball game in Milwaukee was repeatedly delayed Saturday by - of all things - a bat

Numerous Delays: The game between Marquette University and Providence College was halted with 11 minutes and 23 seconds left in the contest's second half

Aging arena: The bat inexplicably gained access to the BMO Harris Bradley Center in downtown Milwaukee, where the NBA Bucks also play, and emerged from the rafters

Swat: Providence College Coach Ed Cooley reportedly tried to swat the marauding mammal with a clipboard on which he usually draws up plays for the team

'They got it. They almost got it. Oh my God! It's crazy! He's making another swoop! He's making another swoop! Oh my God!'

Providence College Coach Ed Cooley, meanwhile, swatted at the marauding bat with a clipboard, while his players, as well as those from competing Marquette University, futilely tossed towels at the obviously-distressed animal.

 'They got it. They almost got it. Oh my God! It's crazy! He's making another swoop! He's making another swoop! Oh my God!'

Spectators joined attempts to corral the critter, gleefully hurling jackets and articles of clothing at the bat from the stands, all of it missing and littering the suddenly-muddled court.  

Meanwhile, the arena's public address announcer utilized the bat's presence to riff on an aging rocker's one-time antics.

As players and referees wildly dove for cover from the animal's repeated plunges, Marquette's public address announcer played 'Crazy Train' by Ozzy Osbourne, who infamously once tore the head off of a bat with his teeth during a concert, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported.

Look out: The moment a bat emerges from the rafters during a basketball game Saturday and swoops down at a panicked Providence College Friars player

Duck and cover: The Providence player dodges the nose-diving bat, stumbling backwards as if he had just drawn a charge

Easy does it: After stumbling backwards, the shocked Providence player loses his balance in the face of the swooping bat

Brace yourself: The Providence player finally tumbles backwards on to his bottom as the bat sews pandemonium among the other players on the court

After delaying the game numerous times to no avail, officials finally dimmed the arena's lights with 7:36 left to play in last-ditch effort to calm the bat. 

The Ozzy Osbourne ode reportedly gave way to a Whitney Houston song on the public address system, according to one media account, as fans waved cell phones in the dark, as if paying an homage at a concert.

After that, the game finally resumed without incident, and Marquette went on to prevail 81-71.

It appeared that the bat might play a decisive role in the outcome of the closely-contested meeting between the two schools.

Quick-witted: The public address official utilized the bizarre moment to play Ozzy Osbourne's 'Crazy Train' in an apparent ode to the rocker's once biting off a bat's head

To corral a bat: As Osbourne's 'Crazy Train' roared on the arena's PA system, players threw towels at the swooping bat, and spectators hurled jackets on to the court

Marquette reportedly held a 58-42 advantage with 11:23 left in the second half when the bat initially started madly swooping around the arena.

As play was delayed several times over the game's next four minutes of play, Providence managed to cut the lead to 61-55.

Marquette University claimed the contest as a home game, as the school, as well as the NBA Milwaukee Bucks, compete in the BMO Harris Bradley Center, which is named after a local bank.

The presence of the unusual arena denizen could be a product of the arena's advancing age, as it was reportedly - and officially - opened to the public on October 1, 1988. The so-called 'Bradley Center' is now one of the oldest arenas in use by an NBA team.
