As some of the biggest stars in the world, One Direction are used to be inundated with fan mail. But despite receiving over 700 handwritten notes in just over a fortnight, these boys seem unaffected by their fans' adoration... because these are just the wax figures.

Madame Tussauds in Blackpool have revealed that they have been overwhelmed with love letters for the wax stars, who took up residence earlier this month.

Undeterred by the fact that these are neither living nor breathing versions of their idols, Directioners have been posting fan mail in their droves to the wax museum.

The letters have been turning up in the boys' clothing as fans leave behind their love notes after posing for photographs with the group. One letter was found in Harry’s blazer and another was hidden in Louis’s back pocket.

Harry has received the most letters with 311, while Niall has been the second most popular so far with 193 notes. 

Madame Tussauds Blackpool has tasked Guest Experience Host and One Direction fan, Clarissa Croft with handling the letters, and ensuring they’re passed safely on to the boys themselves.

'It’s been surprisingly emotional handling all these love letters from fans,' Clarissa says. 'I absolutely love the band myself, so I know how much One Direction means to them. These guys are the ultimate teenage crush.

'We made the decision to collect the letters to show the fans that they’re support is appreciated and to let the band know how loved they are.

'We’re delighted that the boys are in Blackpool and Directioners have the opportunity to come and meet the boys’ figures face-to face.'

Remi Ryles, aged nine from Stoke-on-Trent who took the chance to hand deliver her letter, said: 'I love One Direction so much. I brought in my own letter and gave it Niall, he’s my favourite.'

The quintet of wax figures sit casually together on a school-style double bench where fans can sit right beside them. Wearing clothes donated by the boys, their smart casual style comes across in the fully themed One Direction room in the heart of the attraction.

Each band member gave two sittings to help create the figures. The talented Madame Tussauds studios team took hundreds of precise measurements, examined their skin tones, eye colour and matched up hair swatches to ensure total accuracy.

A team of 40, including sculptors, moulders, hair stylists, colourists and wardrobe experts worked flat out for four months to create the figures which each cost £150,000 to make.
