Rocked by sex scandals: Former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn (above) flew to Athens for discussions with ministers about how to solve Greece's financial crisis... then went clubbing until 5am with a mystery blonde

Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is set to be hired by Greece to help rescue the bankrupt nation’s collapsing economy.

The disgraced French economist jetted to Athens to meet with government ministers last week, it has been reported.

And the 63-year-old - whose career has been wrecked by a catalogue of sex scandals - is set to become an ‘advisor’ on how to solve the country’s financial chaos, Greek newspapers said.

But despite the official nature of his visit, the self-confessed swinger still found time to cavort in a nightclub till 5am with a mystery blonde.

France’s Europe1 radio station said: 'The Greek media is convinced he has been hired as a debt advisor.

'As the former head of the International Monetary Fund, he certainly has the qualifications.

'His financial wizardry has never been in doubt, despite the problems in his private life.'

The radio station added: 'But it wasn’t all work. He went there with some Parisian friends last Wednesday and spent the early evening his his hotel bar.

'Then they went to the exclusive discotheque, The Rich Club, where he, his blonde girlfriend and friends stayed until 5am.'

Strauss-Kahn has been embroiled in a string of sex scandals since he was arrested for allegedly trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year.

After being held in New York’s notorious Ryker’s Island prison, criminal charges were dropped and he returned to France only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

Unlikely saviour? Strauss-Kahn is set to be hired by Greece to help rescue the bankrupt nation's collapsing economy, which has sparked violent protests over the last two years

When those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with more claims he used hookers supplied by a vice network in Lille.

He now looks set to escape charges of gang rape at an orgy in Washington DC after one prostitute changed her story and told police they were playing ‘sex games’.

But the man once tipped as a future president of France still stands accused of conspiring with pimps to procure girls for sex parties around the world.

Strauss-Kahn has admitted to attending many ‘swingers parties’ but insisted the young women were not prostitutes and he often had sex with ‘willing girls’ in their 20s.

His lawyer Richard Malka has described DSK as ‘simple swinger’ who has committed nothing more than ‘crimes of lust’.
