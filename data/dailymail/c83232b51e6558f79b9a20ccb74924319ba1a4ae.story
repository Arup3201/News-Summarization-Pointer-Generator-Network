Cats can now get their claws into North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - by using a unique range of products that go on sale today.

Freedom-loving felines can scratch at him and Russian president Vladimir Putin, thanks to the selection of scratching posts bearing their faces.

The 1.5ft tall toys - which cost £4,500 - took a team of artists 200 hours to finish.

They are made from hessian rope and their 3D-printed faces are attached to the post before being hand-painted.

Clawing back freedom: These scratching posts featuring the likeness of Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, who restrict their countries' internet freedom, have been launched to raise money for anti-censorship campaigners

The selection of pet protest products also include cat litter trays with portraits of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Egypt's Abdel Fattah El Sisi.

The products form part of a campaign dubbed The Pussycat Riot, named for the politically-charged Russian punk band.

It was launched by global network provider HideMyAss.com, which allows netizens to see content blocked by governments.

It was launched after new legislation pushed through by Putin's government was widely condemned for its 'draconian' grip on Russians' internet freedoms.

The satirical cat products protest against regimes which deny citizens the right to access websites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.

 

Other world leaders with questionable track records on internet censorship, such as Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Egypt's Abdel Fattah El Sisi, feature on litter trays

All of the money raised from the products will be donated to the charity Index on Censorship.

Cian McKenna-Charley, marketing director at HideMyAss.com, said: 'To paraphrase its creator, the internet is for everyone.

'But try telling that to the rulers of countries who attempt to 'own' the net and control their citizens through censorship.

'Whether it is Turkey's and Venezuela's bans on YouTube and Twitter, the 'great firewall of China', or Russia's 'law on bloggers' and WiFi curbs, internet censorship is an indefensible attack on civil liberties and it must be stopped.'

He added: 'The internet loves cats, with millions of feline videos and images shared online every day all around the world, and even annual internet cat video festivals held to celebrate the best memes and virals.

'To us the cat is a symbol of freedom, and of a fair and neutral internet.

'We can think of no better mascot to help us fight the ugly face of internet censorship than every netizen's favourite four-legged friend.'

Instagram account holder 'Nala-Cat' who has more than 1,300,000 followers, posted: 'Cats, Cats, Cats! The Internet is cats!...And yet millions are denied cat content every day by cyber censors who control social media.

'Fight cyber censorship - support #ThePussycatRiot.' 

Within a few hours of Nala-Cat posting on Instagram,  25,000 pledged their support and rose to 60,000 12 hours later.
