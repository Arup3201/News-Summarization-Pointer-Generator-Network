Steve Davis, Oklahoma University's star quarterback from its 1974-75 back-to back national championship wins was one of two people killed when a small aircraft smashed into three homes in South Bend, Indiana on Sunday.

St. Joseph County Coroner Randy Magdalinski today identified the victims as 60-year-old Davis and 58-year-old Wesley Caves, both of Tulsa, Oklahoma - Davis' parents, Jim and Patsy Davis confirmed his death to the Associated Press on Monday.

'He absolutely loved getting in the air,' said Deron Spoo, pastor at 
First Baptist Church in Tulsa, where Davis went to church.

Caves owned the Beechcraft Premier I twin-jet that clipped one house before slamming into two more on Sunday afternoon. Caves had a pilot's license, but it was not immediately clear if he was flying the plane when it crashed.

The plane leaked enough fuel to force the evacuation of hundreds of people from surrounding homes, but most residents were allowed to return Monday morning.

Frank Sojka, 84, who lives in the first home that was struck, went back to his home Monday morning so he could retrieve some items. A total of eight homes remain under mandatory evacuation.

'I'm surprised people survived that,' he said as he sat in his car with his son, waiting for police to move the barricade on his street.

Sojka said he was in the front bedroom of the home he's lived in for 55 years when he heard a loud, dull sound.

'I got up and went into the living room and I could see the sky through the ceiling and all kinds of debris in the far end of the living room,' he said.

The front part of the fuselage sat wedged inside the third house just southwest of the South Bend Regional Airport, where the pilot had tried to land the plane Sunday afternoon.

Two others on board the plane survived, South Bend Assistant Fire Chief John Corthier said. South Bend Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Maggie Scroope said Monday that Jim Rogers was in serious condition and Christopher Evans was in fair condition.

A woman who neighbors said lived in the middle house that was struck, Diana McKeown, was in fair condition, Scroope said.

The plane began its journey in Tulsa, Okla. It is registered to 7700 Enterprises in Helena, Mont., which does business in Tulsa as DigiCut Systems and is owned by Caves. Spoo said he did not know the connection between Davis and Caves.

Davis went 32-1-1 as the Sooners' starter from 1973 to 1975, starting every game of Barry Switzer's first three seasons as head coach.

Oklahoma tied Southern California in the second game of the 1973 season, and then ran off 28 straight victories with Davis under center. The Sooners went 11-0 in 1974. They won the national title again the following year after going 11-1.

Davis had joined the about 3,600-member congregation a couple of decades ago, but his travels and work took him elsewhere, Scroope said. He noted that in the last few years, Davis had become a more active member of the church.

'As followers of Jesus, we have two commands: One is to love God; the other is to love people, and Steve fulfilled those commands with excellence,' he said.

Mike Daigle, executive director of the St. Joseph County Airport Authority, said the plane attempted a landing at the South Bend airport about 4:15 p.m., then went back up and maneuvered south to try another landing, but eight minutes later, the airport learned the plane was no longer airborne.

He provided no information to indicate if the pilot said the plane was experiencing mechanical trouble.

Daigle said Monday he has no firsthand knowledge about what caused the crash.

National Transportation Safety Board investigator Todd Fox said late Sunday the agency will be looking for the cause of the crash and 'to identify and remedy any issues that could have prevented this accident.'

This tragic news comes in the wake of the crash in which a young boy miraculously escaped serious injury when the private jet landed on his home.

Neighbors say the child received only a scratch on his head as the Beechcraft Premier I twin-jet slammed through a neighborhood in South Bend, Indiana - plowing through two houses before coming to a rest upside-down in the middle of a third.

The jet was landing at South Bend Regional Airport after a flight from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The plane is registered to 7700 Enterprises of Montana LLC in Helena, Montana. The company is owned by Wes Caves and does business as DigiCut Systems in Tulsa. It makes window film and paint overlay for automobiles.

Caves' wife did answer the phone at their home on Sunday and 
said, 'I think he's dead,' before hanging up.

Stan Klaybor, who lives across the street from the crash scene, said the jet clipped the top of one house, heavily damaged a second, and finally came to rest against a third

Neighbors did not know if a woman living in the most heavily damaged house was home at the time, and a young boy in the third house did not appear to be seriously injured, Klaybor said.

'Her little boy was in the kitchen and he got nicked here,' Klaybor said, pointing to his forehead.

Herwig, the FAA spokesman, says there was 'an indication of a mechanical 
problem.'

The neighborhood has been evacuated because of a gas leak.

resident Stan Klaybor says the aircraft clipped the top of one house,

Neighbors tellÂ WSBT-TV that at least one of the homes had children in it when the jet crashed.

The six-seat private jet took off from Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport in Tulsa, Oklahoma, earlier this afternoon.

The Beechcraft Premier I sells for between $2million and $6million and has a top speed of 530mph.
