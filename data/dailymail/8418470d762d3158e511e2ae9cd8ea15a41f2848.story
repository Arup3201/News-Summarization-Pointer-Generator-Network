This is the moment a newlywed couple's first kiss is cut short as a grossed out boy cries out in disgust.

Allyson and Mike DuBois from Salt Lake City, Utah, were filmed as they locked lips for the first time as man and wife.

But footage shows the romantic moment was swiftly spoiled as a young spectator butted in with a loud 'eww'.

The DuBois are seen breaking into laughter, with Mr DuBois on the verge of tears.

The crowd watching can also be heard giggling at the interruption.

'That was awesome,' Mrs DuBois, 31, says with a big smile on her face.

The bride and groom then go in for  round two.

The bride's brother, Bradley Christopherson, revealed that his son Ashton, now four, was the voice behind the comical commotion.

The DuBois married in April 2014 but footage from their wedding has only recently garnered attention.  

Davey Orgill, the videographer who filmed the clip, concluded:  'You gotta love kids at weddings. They are unpredictable.

'This was such a funny moment. Shooting weddings is so much fun. This was such a cool couple to be able to just laugh it off like that.'
