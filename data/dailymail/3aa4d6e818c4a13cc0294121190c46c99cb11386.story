Hundreds of travellers arriving at Gatwick Airport’s south terminal have suffered several hours’ delays in picking up their luggage, with many being told to go home without it and get it sent later.

A spokesman for the airport said the overnight delays were caused by staff shortages at baggage handling firm Swissport.

Gatwick airport officials apologised and said they were working with airlines and handling agents to ‘improve operations’.

Frustration: The delays at Gatwick airport were caused by staff shortages at baggage handling firm Swissport

‘Due to resourcing issues with the baggage handlers Swissport there were overnight issues and delays with passengers' luggage on some flights,’ a spokesman for the airport said.

‘Gatwick provided extra staff to help the airlines and their baggage handlers improve their service, as well as providing welfare and water for passengers waiting in the baggage areas, but we are sorry for the delays they faced. Baggage operations are now returning to normal.’

Officials at the airport told passengers of British Airways flights who had waited more than an hour to collect their bags, and those on Monarch, Thomas Cook or Thompson flights who had been waiting 90 minutes or more, that their luggage would be sent to their home address.

It is understood easyJet passengers have also been affected but had not been advised to leave without their baggage.

Many passengers, with some having to wait more than four hours before collecting their luggage, vented their anger on Twitter.

Lulu Breed tweeted: ‘@Gatwick_Airport 4 hours for a suitcase! That was ridiculous.’

Sophie Wood wrote: ‘3 hrs in #gatwick baggage handling ... Apparent Lack of staff appalling shambles #Gatwick#idiots.’

Bob Nelson tweeted: 'Baggage problem at Gatwick has been on going for months we had 2 hr wait in May no notices no help. Will never fly from Gatwick again.'

Some complained about a lack of information, with just a Tannoy message apologising for the ‘debacle’ and families with young children having to wait.

One tweeted: ‘Great holiday but sour taste after the debacle in baggage reclaim last night. If Carlsberg did airports it wouldn't be Gatwick Airport!’

Another wrote: ‘I am backing Gatwick for a second runway but if u cant handle passenger influx with one runway, how will u handle 2??’
