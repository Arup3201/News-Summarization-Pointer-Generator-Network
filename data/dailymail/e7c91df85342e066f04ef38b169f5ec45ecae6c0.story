The man who performed fake sign language during a memorial service to Nelson Mandela has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

Thamsanqa Jantjie's wife Siziwe also revealed her husband was supposed to attend a mental health check-up but postponed the appointment so he could be at the ceremony.

The 34-year-old stood just a few feet from from President Obama and other leaders who spoke during the ceremony that was broadcast around the world.

Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, a South African sign language interpreter accused of making up his own signs

Mr Jantjie, 34, stood just a few feet from President Obama and others who spoke at the ceremony

His actions were questioned when it was claimed he was signing words like 'prawns' and 'rocking horse'.

Jantjie's explanation was that he had suffered a schizophrenic episode in which he had 'seen angels and heard voices'.

But in a television interview, his wife showed a bag full of medication he takes for his condition.

She said she took her husband to Sterkfontein Hospital in Krugersdorp for a check-up where it was suggested that he be admitted immediately.

'I would like to tell everybody that if I've offended anyone, please, forgive me,' Mr Jantjie said

'The past few days have been hard. We have been supportive because he might have had a breakdown,' Siziwe said.

Jantjie was supposed to attend a check-up at Sterkfontein on December 10.

However,
 when he was offered the job to interpret at the memorial service, 
Siziwe called the hospital on his behalf and asked that he be given 
another date.

South African news website eNCA
 reported that Mr Jantjie has faced charges for rape (1994), theft 
(1995), housebreaking (1997), malicious damage to property (1998), 
murder, attempted murder and kidnapping (2003) charges.

The
 website said it was unclear if the 2003 murder case was ever concluded 
as the court file was found to be empty during their investigations.

Mr Jantjie said that his hallucinations began while he was interpreting and that 
he tried not to panic because there were 'armed policemen around me.'

When Mr Jantjie was shown video footage of him interpreting on stage at the Mandela memorial service he said 'I don't remember any of this at all'

He added that he was once hospitalised in a mental health facility for more than one year.

Jantjie said he worked for a company called SA Interpreters which had 
been hired by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) for the ceremony at Johannesburg's 
95,000-seat Soccer City stadium.

He said he was paid 85 dollars (£52) for interpreting the event.

But he also apologised for his performance that has been dismissed by many sign-language experts as gibberish.

'I
 would like to tell everybody that if I've offended anyone, please, 
forgive me,' Mr Jantjie said in his concrete home in a low-income 
Johannesburg neighbourhood

'But what I was doing, I was doing what I believe is my calling, I was doing what I believe makes a difference.'

'What
 happened that day, I see angels come to the stadium ... I start 
realising that the problem is here. And the problem, I don't know the 
attack of this problem, how will it comes. Sometimes I react violent on 
that place. Sometimes I will see things that chase me,' Mr Jantjie said. 

'I was in a very 
difficult position,' he added.

'And remember those people, the president
 and everyone, they were armed, there was armed police around me. If I 
start panicking I'll start being a problem. I have to deal with this in a
 manner so that I mustn't embarrass my country.'

Asked how often he had become violent, he said 'a lot' while declining to provide details.

Mr Jantjie
 said he was due on the day of the ceremony to get a regular six-month 
mental health checkup to determine whether the medication he takes was 
working, whether it needed to be changed or whether he needed to be kept
 at a mental health facility for treatment.

Claims: Braam Jordaan, a deaf South African and board member of the World Deaf Federation, claimed the man was simply making up his own signs

Address: U.S. President Barack Obama addresses the crowd while the interpreter stands next to him

Mis-matched: The man's movement's did not match that of the official interpreter, left

He
 said he did not tell the company that contracted him for the event for 
about $85 that he was due for the checkup, but said the owner of SA 
Interpreters in Johannesburg was aware of his condition.

Jantjie
 said he received one year of sign language interpretation at a school 
in Cape Town, and insisted that he has previously interpreted at many 
events without anyone complaining.

When footage was shown to Jantjie of him interpreting on stage at the Mandela memorial service, he said: 'I don't remember any of this at all.'

A South African deputy cabinet minister admitted 'a mistake happened' in hiring Mr Jantjie.

Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu said that government officials have tried to track down the company that provided Mr Jantjie but that the owners 'have vanished into thin air.'

Deputy Minister of Women, Children and People with Disabilities Bogopane-Zulu apologised to deaf people offended around the world by what they say was Jantjie's incomprehensible signing.

She says an investigation was under way to determine how Jantjie received a security clearance.

South Africa's leading deaf association claimed he was a fake and said he was inventing signs.

The ANC has also denied knowing about him although footage from two large ANC events last year showed him signing 
on stage next to President Jacob Zuma.

Mr Jantjie has apologised for the incident and said he did not know what triggered the attack, saying he took medication for his schizophrenia
