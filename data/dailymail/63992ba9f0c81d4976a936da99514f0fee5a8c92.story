Four weapons testers were rescued from a bunker by an armoured vehicle after an explosion at a Ministry of Defence site.

According to Essex Fire Service, around 22lb (10kg) of explosives were involved in the blast, which occurred at a weapons testing centre at MoD Shoeburyness, near Southend.

The weapons testers were freed by MoD officers in an armoured personnel carrier, but there were no injuries.

Incident: According to Essex Fire Service, around 22lb (10kg) of explosives were involved in the blast, which occurred at a weapons testing centre at MoD Shoeburyness, pictured, near Southend

Five fire crews attended the incident, which happened at around 11am today.

A spokesman for QinetiQ, the private defence contractor that runs the Blackgate Road munitions centre, said: 'No-one was hurt in the incident at our environmental test centre and we are conducting a full investigation into what happened as is part of our standard safety procedures.'

He later added: 'As part of routine in-service testing conducted on behalf of the MoD, a planned and remotely controlled test took place at MoD Shoeburyness today.

'A contained fire occurred at one of the environmental test centre buildings on site following the test. No-one was injured.

Tragic: Scientist Terry Jupp was killed following an explosion at the Shoeburyness site back in 2002

'The emergency services were called as part of standard procedures, their assistance was not required and they were subsequently stood down.

'An investigation is under way as part of our standard safety procedures.'

A Government scientist was killed at the Shoeburyness site in August 2002 when he was left with horrific burns by secret bomb-making equipment.

The 46-year-old was part of a small team of British and U.S. scientists involved in assessing the destructive capabilities of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda in the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks.

The experiment attempted to measure the impact of homemade bombs similar to those used by terrorists.

As part of the trial, Mr Jupp was told to mix a 22lb explosive charge using highly volatile chemicals at Foulness Island, part of the Shoeburyness site.

The chemicals were mixed in a modified cement mixer before being poured into an old paint tin so they could be taken to the firing range.

However, the explosive ignited unexpectedly and Mr Jupp, who worked for the MoD for 25 years, suffered almost 90 per cent burns.

The heat from the explosion, which blew out all the windows of the building in which he was working, was so intense that it melted his hair to his head and charred grass up to 25ft away.

The jury at the inquest into Mr Jupp's death, which was held in 2010, concluded that planning and risk assessment had not been appropriate.
