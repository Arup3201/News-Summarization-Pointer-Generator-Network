A baby boy is one of just 63 people in the world with a rare condition causing his heart to squirt  blood around his body instead of pumping it.

Six-month-old Jack Renton's heart  could stop at any moment as blood is only squirted around his body intermittently and not constantly pumped around it.

He was diagnosed with extremely rare condition '8p23 deletion', which causes heart conditions, learning difficulties and behavioural  issues such as hyperactivity and impulsiveness.

Little fighter: Six month old baby Jack Renton, from Elsdon, Northumberland, is one of just 63 people in the world with a heart that squirts blood instead of pumping it after being born with the extremely rare condition '8p23 deletion'

Brave: Jack Renton, pictured with his mother Joanne Wright and father Davey Renton, is now due to have an operation to secure an elastic band around a heart valve to stop it squirting blood rather than pumping it

The condition is caused by cells in the body having a small but variable  amount of genetic material missing from one of their 46 chromosomes -  chromosome eight.

The toddler will soon undergo surgery to tie an  elastic band around the valve in his heart to stop it squirting and force it to  pump instead.

His parents, farmers Joanne Wright and Davey Renton, from Elsdon, near Hexham,  Northumberland, found out they were  expecting last September but quickly realised something wasn't right at a 20-week scan when the baby was tested for Down's Syndrome.

Risk: Jack Renton's heart could stop at any moment because of his condition

Ms Wright, 30, said: 'The blood test for Down's syndrome came back as very high so  I had an amniocentesis. 

'It was then that they found the 8p23 deletion. The doctors and nurses were fantastic, talking it all through, helping us to  understand. 

'Basically it meant Jack's heart wasn't right. There was no way I was going to have a termination. We were already in love  with our baby, and I felt, in my heart of hearts, that he or she was a survivor.

'We knew that the right chamber of his heart is very small and that blood is  squirted around his body rather than pumped. 

'He also has a hole in the middle of both chambers in his heart. It all sounds  very scary.'

Jack was born prematurely in May at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary Hospital weighing just 4lb 14ozs.

Ms Wright said: 'Davey kept telling me it would all be OK. He told me it would be just like  lambing a ewe, which made me laugh. 

'Jack came out with a loud cry and promptly weed all over the midwife. I was expecting him to be so vulnerable, so quiet and weak, but he's a  fighter. He has defied all the odds and we are all just amazed by him.'

Following his birth, Jack was taken from the couple and immediately transferred to  the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle for specialist treatment, where he stayed for  21 days.

Mrs Wright said: 'I knew that he was getting the help he needed, but I missed him  desperately. 

'I remember sobbing through the night - I just wanted to be with him.'

Now that Jack is six months old, doctors have scheduled surgery in the next few  months on his heart.

Early diagnosis: Jack's parents found out that he had the rare condition when his mother Joanne Wright, pictured, went for her 20 week scan

Mr Renton, 34, said: 'Jack is putting on weight - he's getting stronger and stronger  every day. He's our little fighter and we're so proud of him.'

The couple hope to get married next autumn and christen baby Jack on the same day.

Ms Wright said: 'We want to celebrate Jack and our life together in one big day,  with all the people we love around us.

'We're hoping Jack's surgery will all be over with by the time of the wedding  and christening next autumn.

'I'm only just allowing myself to get excited about it.'
