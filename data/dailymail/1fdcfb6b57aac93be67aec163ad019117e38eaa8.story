A British corporate consultant and his wife have been arrested in China amid a corruption probe into GlaxoSmithKline and other drug multinationals in the country.

Former journalist Peter Humphrey and his wife and business partner Yu Yingzeng, who have been detained by the Chinese police since July, were arrested for ‘purchasing personal information’.

Humphrey has run a consultancy in China called ChinaWhys since 2003. In the past he has carried out work for GSK, though it is not yet clear if the pair’s arrest is linked to the UK drug company.

Probe: Peter Humphrey and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, were detained in Shanghai on July 10 as police looked into bribery allegations against GlaxoSmithKline, whose headquarters in south-west London are pictured

Last month Chinese authorities said GSK had funnelled £312m through travel agencies to bribe doctors and officials. China is also investigating French drug firm Sanofi over corruption allegations.

In China, an arrest 
typically means police believe they have enough evidence for a case to 
be brought to trial. Detentions can last for weeks and end in release 
without charges being filed.

China has taken a tough stance on corruption and high prices in the pharmaceutical industry as it unrolls wider healthcare access and faces an estimated £650billion healthcare bill by 2020.

A British Embassy spokesman said: ‘We can confirm the arrest of a British national, Peter Humphrey, in Shanghai on Monday the 19th of August. We are currently providing consular assistance.’

A statement issued by one of Humphrey's relatives said lawyers told the family that the couple had been detained last month because they broke a law related to buying private information.

ChinaWhys is a business risk advisory firm co-founded by Humphrey and Yu that has done work with drugs companies, including GSK, separate sources have said.

Humphrey worked as a journalist for Reuters in the 1980s and 90s. The ChinaWhys website says he has been a risk management specialist and corporate detective for 14 years.

Four executives from mining giant Rio Tinto were jailed for taking bribes and stealing commercial secrets in 2010. Three of those executives were Chinese. The fourth was a Chinese-born Australian.
