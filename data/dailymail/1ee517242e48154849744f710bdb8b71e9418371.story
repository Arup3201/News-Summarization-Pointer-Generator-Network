Saturday Night Live took inspiration from Thursday’s fiery debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan.

In fact, the clash between the two politicians was such good fodder that many lines from the cold open were taken verbatim from last week’s exchange, focusing on Biden’s constant snickering, gesturing, and grinning.

Biden, played by long-time SNL veteran Jason Sudeikis, called one of Taran Killam’s statements a ‘bunch of malarkey.’ When Ryan explained that it was an Irish expression, Sudeikis responded: ‘No, Irish is I come over there and smack that dumb look off your face.’

The long-running NBC show relied heavily on the debate itself, using lines about stuff, malarkey, and beans as springboards.

Kate McKinnon played ABC News’ Martha Raddatz, beginning the debate by telling Killam and Sudeikus: ‘As a reminder, your performance is extremely unlikely to have an effect on the election.’

She also set the two men in their place, asking at one point, ‘Do I look like Jim Lehrer? Do I talk like Jim Lehrer? Then don’t try to f*** me like Jim Lehrer,’ referring to the PBS anchor’s timid performance during the presidential debates the week before.

In the skit, Sudeikis and Killam discussed several talking points, including the fact that both men came from small towns – Ryan is from Jamesville, Wisconsin, and Biden heralds from Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Killam asked Sudeikis if he knew the unemployment rate is now 10 per cent in Scranton, to which Sudeikis responded: ‘Things may be bad where you live, but it’s a paradise next to the burning coal-heap that is Scranton.

'If you went to the lowest circle of hell, you’d still be 45 minutes outside of Scranton.’

Bunch of stuff? Kate McKinnon played ABC News' Martha Raddatz, beginning the debate by telling candidates: 'Your performance is extremely unlikely to have an effect on the election'

Thirsty Thursday: The sketch mocked how much water Ryan drank during the 90-minute debate; in the skit, Killam drank a comically-large class of water, then going to a water bottle meant for pets

Following another question of bi-partisanship, Sudeikis said that his much younger debate partner didn’t scare him, with his ‘shark eyes.’ 

Referring to Ryan’s gruelling PX90 workout regime, he said: ‘There’s gym strong, and there’s old man strong. You want to know my work out? When my Amtrak breaks down on my morning commute, I strip down to my tighty whities and pull the train to Washington.’

While Sudeikis was speaking, Killan chugged a comically-large glass of water, and was then given even more water through a pet's water bottle.

Asked to be more specific on his tax plans, Killan responded: ‘No, I can’t be specific, but let say the same thing, with hand gestures.’

McKinnon also asked Ryan to stop looking directly into the lens because he was ‘scaring small children.’

Cool and collected: Huffington Post creator Arianna Huffington, played by Nasim Pedrad, joined Seth Meyers to talk about Martha Raddatz's performance as moderator

For a closing statement, Killan said that he won the 100m race during this summer’s Olympic games in London. He said: ‘If you don’t believe me, ask my runningmate, Usain Bolt.’

Right on cue, the gold medallist sauntered onstage. ‘Please tell them who won the 100m,’ he said.‘I did,’ Bolt deadpanned.

During Weekend Update with Seth Meyers, the head writer discussed the vice president and vice presidential candidate’s varying strategies ahead of the debate. 

Meyers said that while Ryan prepared for Thursday’s debates by practicing foreign policy, ‘Biden prepared by shotgunning Redbull and watching Yosemite Sam cartoon. In fairness,’ he added, ‘a bunch of stuff is the entire economic part of the Romney/Ryan plan.’

He also jibbed Romney’s shifting stance on abortion, conceding that the procedure was appropriate in cases of rape and incest.

Meyers said that Romney still wants to be seen as a pro-life president, but he noted, ‘Romney defines life as anyone making over $250,000 a year.’

Arianna Huffington, played by Nasim Pedrad, joined Meyers to talk about Martha Raddatz’s much-talked about performance as moderator. But before she talked shop, Pedrad sneaked in a compliment to Meyers, calling him 'the cabana boy I never had.'

On Raddatz, she offered: 'It’s wonderful to have a woman moderating. Only a woman would call someone a friend and then b*** about them for 90 minutes.’

In another timely skit, SNL poked fun at iPhone 5 enthusiasts who were less than wowed by the new Apple product. In the skit, host Christina Applegate played host to a panel discussion between experts from Wired and C-Net and workers at the embattled FoxConn corporation in China.

The panellists whined about glitches and design flaws, as well as having to wait in line to purchase the coveted smartphone. But the three FoxConn workers didn’t seem to care.

‘Talk about Apple map, you want Starbuck (sic), it take you to Dunkin’ Donut (sic), that must be so hard for you!’ one worker said.

‘We don’t need map because we sleep where we work,’ another chimed in.
