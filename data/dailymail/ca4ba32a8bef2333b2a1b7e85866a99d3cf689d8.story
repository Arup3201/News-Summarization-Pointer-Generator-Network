Gianluigi Buffon's landmark 500th Serie A appearance for Juventus ended on a sorry note as substitute Luca Antonini's last-gasp goal gave Genoa a 1-0 victory.

The Italy goalkeeper has long been a mainstay at the Turin club following his move from Parma in 2001 and he had little to do at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris, but it would prove to be a miserable night for the 36-year-old, who was wearing a special armband to commemorate his milestone.

Antonini, who was introduced from the bench in the 81st minute, bundled home in added-on time as Juve were made to pay for wasting a string of chances as they saw their unbeaten record and three-point lead at the Serie A summit disappear following Roma's 2-0 win over Cesena.

The capital club moved level on points with the reigning champions as they remained perfect at the Stadio Olimpico.

Mattia Destro's eighth-minute goal put the hosts on their way before Daniele De Rossi made it 2-0 nine minutes from time.

AC Milan took advantage of defeats for Udinese and Sampdoria to move up to third following a 1-1 draw at Cagliari.

Filippo Inzaghi's men did it the hard way as Giacomo Bonventura's 34th-minute strike cancelled out Victor Ibarbo's opener 10 minutes earlier while the Sardinian side wasted several chances to grab a second-half winner, with Daniele Conti coming closest when he hit a post.

Sampdoria suffered their first defeat of the season as Mauro Icardi's last-minute penalty gave Inter Milan a 1-0 victory.

Yet they remain in fourth position as Udinese dropped two places following a 3-0 defeat at Fiorentina.

Khouma Babacar scored either side of half-time, while Fiorentina mainstay Borja Valero scored the final goal of the evening to boost La Viola into the top half of the Serie A table.

Gonzalo Higuain struck four minutes from time as Napoli made it six games unbeaten in the league with a 1-1 draw at Atalanta, who took the lead just before the hour through German Denis but had Luca Cigarini sent off in the 83rd minute.

Palermo claimed just their second win of the season as Luca Rigoni's 81st-minute strike gave them a 1-0 victory over Chievo, while Matteo Darmian's 10th-minute goal ensured victory by the same margin for Torino over Parma, who remain rooted to the foot of the standings and whose misery was compounded when Alex Cordaz was sent off from the bench for dissent.
