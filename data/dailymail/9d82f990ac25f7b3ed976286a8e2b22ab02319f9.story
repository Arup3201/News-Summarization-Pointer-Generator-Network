In the Americas' most populated city, the word 'casa' can mean anything from the president's £4.4million mansion - to the carriage of an rusted freight train.

In an impoverished district of Mexico City, over two hundred people have lived in an abandoned train for over 20 years, with each of the 40 rusted wagons containing on average 20 people each.

A community made up of railway workers and their families, the neighbourhood on wheels now boasts a primary school, wireless internet connection and shops selling tacos from cut-out windows.

Home sweet home: The wagons, in Mexico City, were abandoned by the railway companies more than 20 years ago

Neighbourhood: The community is home to railway workers and their families - all crammed in the small spaces

Creature comforts: The wagons now have WiFi, while those who get peckish can pop to a shop selling tacos from one abandoned railway cart

'It's been a huge change,' said Oscar Hernandez, who recently moved into Wagon 28, home to his girlfriend, his girlfriend's children, his mother-in-law, his girlfriend's siblings, their partners and children in Wagon 28. The 30 square-metre wagon is home to a total of 16 people.

'Before I was living alone in a rented apartment,' he told MailOnline. 'When I moved in with my girlfriend and her family it was overwhelming.'

'Space is certainly a problem, and things have only gotten more cramped as the family has grown,' said 31-year-old Marta Mendoza, Oscar's girlfriend who has lived in the train wagon for most of her life. 'There's nowhere to hide when there is a fight.'

The lived-in train is a rare sight. Each carriage is the size of a shipping container, with a welded-out front door facing onto adjacent tracks where working trains run. 

Advertisements for wagons selling chicken and fruit are painted beneath the high windows, while others have constructed entire concrete annexes alongside their metal box homes. Washing lines wave faster in wake of passing engine cars.

The area below the cars, where the rusted tracks and wheels have sat motionless for two decades, is used by some residents as attic space. Others leave their children to play hide-and-seek around the machinery.

Attics: The spaces underneath the wagons have been turned into attics by some families, while others are used by children as play areas - and this one is used by Daniel Leon, collecting the grain he exchanges for cheap liquor

Community: Entire families live in the wagons, known as 'The Beast' -  a nod to the trains on which Central American migrants cross Mexico on their way north to the US border

Railway: The wagons were abandoned because they fell between two companies when the railways were privatised - and neither claimed them

Peaceful: There used to be a lot of burglary in the area, but things have now changed for the best

'I used to love playing under the cars as a child,' says Nicolas Mendez, who lives in Wagon 4. 'You can run the length of the train under the tracks and enter other people's carriages without using the front door.'

'There used to be a lot of burglary,' said Daniel Leon, who lives in Wagon 31. 'There was no security around the abandoned train station and gangs used to terrorise the residents.

'Things have calmed down since the community established a neighbourhood watch, people feel safer around the tracks today than they did a few years ago.'

Crowded: There are about 40 families living in the wagons in Mexico City

Demand: Roberto Hernandez, the Naucalpan station master who lives in Wagon 40, was given permission to allow railway workers live in the wagons by the companies - and filled each one as they were needed

Spacious: Each carriage is the size of a shipping container, with a welded-out front door facing onto adjacent tracks where working trains run

Scrap: Despite the community living in the wagons, the Mexican government has decided it now wants them for scrap - so is trying to evict the families

The community's primary school, which teaches children up to age 12, has had to expand as a result of the growing community. Alan Contreras teaches a class of 25 children in the converted classroom of Wagon 1.

'It's like any other school, except that I live in the wagon next door,' he told the MailOnline, as the unruly Mexican children ran amok during a maths lesson. 

'You have to watch the children very carefully at break times. We've had kids get stuck in the machinery of the undercarriage before.'

The primary school not only takes students from the 40 or so families who live in the train carriages, but also from the wider municipality of Naucalpan, the poor district of Mexico City in which the train is situated.

School: Children up to the age of 12 are taught in Wagon 1, which has been converted into a classroom

Learning: There are 25 children enrolled in the school, with some coming from the wider community

Normal: Teacher Alan Contreras says his class is just like any other - the only difference is it is in a wagon

Eagle-eyed: 'You have to watch the children very carefully at break times - ee've had kids get stuck in the machinery of the undercarriage before,' says Contreras

When Mexico National Railways was privatised in 1995, the investors who took over the company broke it up into four separate, privately-run organisations, each of which marked out a territory in which they were to operate. 

'The Beast', as its residents affectionately call the train (in honour of the trains on which Central American migrants cross Mexico on their way north to the US border) sits between the territories of two separate railway companies, and was claimed by neither when the buyouts occurred.

'When the railways were privatised the train was abandoned,' explained Roberto Hernandez, the Naucalpan station master who lives in Wagon 40. 

It was Roberto who first organised for railroad employees to inhabit the abandoned carriages. 

'The company (Mexico National Railways) gave permission for employees to live in the carriages. I simply filled demand as it came.'

'It's a peaceful community,' said Daniel Leon, who lost his legs 20 years ago, after falling asleep on the train tracks following a 56-hour shift. When he woke up, he says, his legs were gone.

Business: Daniel Leon, who lost his legs 20 years ago, works underneath the railway carriages

Fight: The families who have made the wagons their home have vowed to fight agains the evicitions

Today Daniel earns money by crawling under the stationary freight train which waits outside the flour factory next to his train carriage. 

'I couldn't do it if I had any legs,' he says.

Placing a tarpaulin under the carriages' outlet taps, he catches any loose grains of wheat as he bangs on the structure. 'I make tortillas to eat from the grains, the rest I exchange for cheap liquor,' he revealed.

Last August, the residents of the train received a letter from the Mexican federal government demanding that they leave the train carriages, since, as the remaining government assets in the railways are liquidised, the wagons are wanted to be sold for scrap metal.

The residents are fighting the action.

'This train wagon is our home,' said Marta Mendoza, 'My children were born here, it's seen too many memories to give it all up now.'
