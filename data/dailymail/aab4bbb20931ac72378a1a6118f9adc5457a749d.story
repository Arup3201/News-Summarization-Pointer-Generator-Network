Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will warn Alex Salmond that a proposed currency union with the UK if his nation votes for independence may not be viable

The head of the Bank of England will this week warn Alex Salmond about the dangers of a separate Scotland keeping the pound.

Bank Governor Mark Carney is expected to compare the ‘currency union’ between the rest of the UK and an independent Scotland proposed by the SNP to the crisis-hit Eurozone when he meets the First Minister for the first time later this week.  

If he secures a yes vote in September’s referendum, Mr Salmond claims Scotland could keep the pound, with the Bank of England continuing to represent Scots and make key decisions on issues like interest rates.  

But it has emerged that the Canadian bank chief has major concerns about whether formal currency-sharing unions can ever work between countries. 

And he has confirmed that he intends to raise these concerns when he meets the SNP leader and delivers a major speech in Edinburgh on Wednesday.   

In a interview recorded last week, Mr Carney warned of ‘issues’ with currency unions which have already been seen in Europe. 

In a clear reference to the troubles of crisis-hit countries like Greece and Cyprus, he also warned of the ‘challenges of having a currency union without certain institutional structures’.

It is a significant intervention from Mr Carney, who has not previously discussed the issue of Scottish independence in detail.    

When asked if an independent Scotland could keep the pound, he said: ‘Well, there are issues with respect to currency unions. We’ve seen them in Europe.  

‘It’s one of the factors that affects the outlook for the UK economy, has affected us over the last five years, affects us going forward - the challenges of having a currency union without certain institutional structures.

Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond has previously claimed that his country could keep the pound, with the Bank of England continuing to represent Scots and make key decisions on issues like interest rates.

‘I’m actually going to speak to this issue in Scotland next week and I’m certainly going to meet with the First Minister prior to doing so.’

The comments come after senior members of the UK Government warned that it was ‘unlikely’ that the rest of the UK would agree to a pound-sharing union after independence.  

Although he is unlikely to completely rule out the possibility of a pound-sharing union in Scotland, Mr Carney is expected to raise his concerns about how it would work in a private meeting with Mr Salmond on Wednesday, before he delivers a speech to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry in Edinburgh. 

However, when asked if he would look forward to managing a shared currency with an independent Scotland, he insisted the he and his colleagues ‘would implement whatever remit we were given’.

A UK Government source said: ‘It is significant that Mr Carney has outlined the comparison that others have been making. 

'We have been saying for some time that a formal currency union on the UK pound is highly unlikely.  More and more individual voices are now saying why that is so.’ 

Mr Carney is expected to warn that the new union could be plagued by the same problems that have threatened the crisis-hit Euro

In a further blow to the SNP, a former chief manager at the Bank of England has also warned that a deal on a currency union ‘is not in Alex Salmond’s power’ – and that English voters could demand that a deal is blocked.

John Nugée, who has also worked in senior roles at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the European Investment Bank, said that a currency union would mean that the rest of the UK would have to give up some of its decision-making power on economic issues – which he said it was ‘conspicuously unwilling to do with its EU partners’.  

In an article published today, he said it is ‘almost certainly in Scotland’s interests’ to reach an agreement with the rest of the UK to share the pound, but went on: ‘It is not in Alex Salmond’s power to do so single-handedly.

'It requires the agreement and consent of the continuing UK government, and it is nothing like as clear that - viewed from England, Wales and Northern Ireland - a common monetary area with an independent Scotland is desirable.’

He warned that the rest of the UK may not be willing to give up some of its economic power to a separate Scotland and may not be willing to accept the risk of having to ‘bear the lion’s share of any financial bail-outs’.

And he also warned of a backlash from English voters after a yes vote, who may demand that there is ‘no hanging on to the best bits of the Union’.

A poll on Scottish independence will be held on September 18 this year, and if successful Scottish independence day is planned for March 2016

Mr Nugée said: ‘At the moment, it suits the nationalists not to allow voice from elsewhere in the UK too much of a platform.

'But if Scotland votes yes, they will have to allow the rest of the UK to speak, because you cannot negotiate with someone to whom you do not allow a voice.  

‘And if the nationalists will have to talk to the rest of the UK after a yes vote, it might be advisable to know what they are thinking and listen to what they are saying before it.’

The Better Together campaign is also today publishing the views of 50 experts who have raised doubts about a currency union.  

Campaign leader Alistair Darling said: ‘The choice we face is clear - believe Alex Salmond or believe the experts and the facts.’

A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘The Scottish Government has put forward sensible proposals for a formal monetary union that would ensure both governments had full flexibility over their fiscal policies, within an overall sustainable framework.’
