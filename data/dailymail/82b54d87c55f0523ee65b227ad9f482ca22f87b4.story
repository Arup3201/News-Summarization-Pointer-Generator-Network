A BBC reporter has revealed her battle with skin cancer after becoming addicted to tanning and using sunbeds.

Laura McMullan has now called for high street sunbed shops to be banned after a new programme hosted by the reporter branded them as harmful as cigarettes and alcohol.

The 39-year-old, who carried out the investigation for BBC1, believes it was her over-tanning that caused the disease.

In the episode of the BBC investigative show Inside Out, to be broadcast on Monday, Miss McMullan walks 19-year-old Jess through the dangers of sunbed usage.

Jess works in a tanning salon and regularly uses its services. Miss McMullan said: 'I just wanted to shake her and say 'Please, don't keep doing this'. She looks beautiful on the outside but underneath, who knew what damage she was doing to herself.

The worst skin to go underneath sunbeds or in the sun is pale skin and blue eyes, which is what she's got. She's a carbon copy of me when I was 19. We didn't know before we started how much damage she had done but I really wanted to make her think.'

Miss McMullan was inspired to make the film for the BBC after recovering from her own cancer, which was diagnosed in February last year. She was determined to educate people on the dangers of using sunbeds and of tanning in general.

She said: 'You read the papers and you hear peoples' stories that they spend thousands a month on tanning. I read one article from a girl who said that even if she got skin cancer she would still go on sunbeds.

Miss McMullan, pictured before being diagnosed with skin cancer, says she first started using sunbeds at the age of 16 and soon became addicted to having a tan

'If she could go through one day of what I've been through she would totally take that comment back. People don't think of skin cancer as a serious type of cancer, they think they can just get it cut out and move on, you go through hell. 

'I really, really, really want to hit home to people that just for the sake of a tan, you are risking your life.'

Miss McMullan first began using sunbeds at the age of 16, when her family would hire a home sunbed once every three weeks for about a week at a time. It triggered a 20-year addiction to tanning, for ten of which she was using sunbeds almost daily.

She said: 'I'm convinced it started was when my older brother had hired a sunbed at home, we used to have them brought to the house and dropped off. I thought I would just pop under and have a go.

'It was one where you put it over your bed and you hop in and you do one side and then the other side and I just thought 'this is lovely and warm and I've got a bit of a glow'.

'I believe UV rays do promote serotonin, which is a happy hormone. I've always been pale growing up, I think you just try it one and you like it, you try it again and you like it and you do it more and more. I really was addicted, you just can't buy that feeling in a tonic.

'You start to see yourself in the mirror and think you like to have a healthy glow. I eventually thought I didn't look like me anymore when I was pale, so I kept on going.'

She hopes her report will help educate others on the dangers and allow them to avoid the mistakes she made.

She added: 'It was never pointed out by a professional person or anyone who worked in the tanning salons or who dropped the sunbeds off at home but my mum used to say to me 'Laura, what damage are you doing to your skin?'

'My dad is pale too and he would tell me I would damage my skin in years to come but it just made me feel good and when I started working on the radio I was office based and I had a lunch hour every day and I would pop off to use a sunbed in my lunch hour.

'My colleagues used to say: 'Laura, what are you doing?' It was standing joke at work, whenever I went on holiday, they would ask 'What shade are you aiming for?' and I would say mahogany. Lots of people around me were saying things but it took me getting a devastating diagnosis for me to actually stop and for it to hit home.

'I'm not blaming anybody, I chose to do that but what I have got an issue with is that I was never given an informed choice.

'Not once in all the ten years I was using tanning beds did anyone ever say to me, you've got pale skin and blue eyes be careful what you do with your skin, or that if you do too much you might get skin cancer.

'There was no warning signs in the shop of anything. A lot more education is needed, especially with young people.'

With more than 11,000 new cases of malignant melanoma in the UK each year, Miss McMullan believes tanning salons are a significant contributor to this.

The BBC Midlands reporter has now carried out an investigation for BBC1, where she looks into the dangers of tanning. She is pictured receiving a spray tan after recovering from skin cancer 

Official guidance across the EU sets a maximum UV intensity to be used by commercial sunbeds. This figure must be adhered to by all members of the UK Sunbed Association.

However, with only 20 per cent of the industry affiliated to this body, Miss McMullan thinks it would be safer for sunbeds to be banned entirely until a tougher regulatory system is put in place.

Research funded by Cancer Research UK revealed that out of 400 sunbeds tests, 90 per cent had UV light intensities exceeding the EU recommended limit, sometimes up to double.

Miss McMullan added: 'It's like cigarettes and alcohol, people have their vices. Cigarettes come with a health warning, so does alcohol but sunbeds don't and I totally think they are on par. It's a hot topic of discussion but I totally think sunbeds should at least come with a warning that they can cause cancer.

'Some people will say if you use them responsibly you will be fine but sunbeds are so open to abuse and the majority of them are not regulated.

During her programme for the BBC, Miss McMullan meets 19-year-old Jess, pictured, who works in a tanning salon and regularly uses its services

During the show, the pair visit Staffordshire University, where Jess's skin is analysed to see how much tanning is affecting her face 

'So, if there was a proper regulation and licencing program then that would be great but until then, and that's a long way off, I would like to see them banned.'

This is a call echoed by Deemesh Oudit, a skin cancer expert and Miss McMullan's consultant.

He told the BBC1 programme: 'I would definitely like to see sunbeds banned. Because the UV radiation has a significant risk of patients developing melanoma [skin cancer].'

And speaking to MailOnline, he added: 'As a consultant at The Christie [cancer centre], I see first-hand the harm that UV radiation does to the skin and the impact that melanoma has on patients. Sadly, despite our best efforts, many people do not survive melanoma.

'Therefore, I believe there is a strong case for sunbed use to be controlled more strongly and personally would like to see them prohibited.'

But Gary Lipman, chairman of the Sunbed Association, said: 'Our members have followed a strict Code of Practice for more than 20 years with requirements that exceed the current calls for extended legislation which The Sunbed Association was a full participant in and which we fully support.

A computer analysis of Jess's skin shows how much it has aged through using sunbeds as part of the BBC1 programme

'When interviewed by Laura McMullan, I provided her with the evidence that clearly demonstrated there is categorically no scientific data to support a link between professional sunbed use and melanoma, it is purely and simply a statistically skewed myth.

'Responsible sunbed use in a salon in membership of the Sunbed Association is an entirely safe way to tan for those people who can tan and want to tan.

'The research about sunbeds emitting higher intensity levels was conducted in 2011 which was around the same time that the new emission level regulation came into effect.

If that research was undertaken today the results would be completely different. We know this as fact from our own research covering thousands of sunbeds, activity undertaken by local authorities and the fact that compliant sunbeds tube sales have risen by more than 500 per cent.'

The episode of BBC Inside Out featuring Miss McMullan's report will be broadcast on Monday at 7.30pm on BBC One (West Midlands). It will also be available on the BBC iPlayer.
