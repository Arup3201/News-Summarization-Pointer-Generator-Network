Grisly: Police said Chimboza was chewing flesh at the crime scene

A businessman in Africa has admitted to a savage act of cannibalism – ripping a man’s heart out and eating it ‘to show he was not gay’, while the victim was still alive.

Andrew Chimboza, 35, told Cape Town police in a statement that he killed Mbuyiselo Manona, 62, in self-defence at the home of a client in the township of Gugulethu after being insulted.

Prosecutor Quawnita Geyer read out the statement during a bail hearing at the Athlone Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town on Wednesday.

He said: ‘In your warning statement you say... “I sit upon him and stabbed him on the chest, tore out his heart and took a knife and then sliced his heart and then I ate his heart.”

“’The reason for me to eat the unknown guy's heart was to show him that I am not a moffie [gay] and after I finished eating the heart, I realised he was dead.”’

Investigating officer Constable Mphumelelo Yengwa attended the autopsy and reported its horrifying conclusion.

According to The Citizen he said: ‘It was conducted by Dr Allie. Dr Allie told me that the heart is not present in the deceased’s body and therefore, when the heart was taken out, he could see that the deceased was still alive.’

Yengwa told the hearing that the officer who arrested Chimboza at the scene found him chewing raw flesh and that Manona's neck had been 'half-eaten'. He added that his chest had a gaping hole in the left side.

However, Chimboza, originally from Zimbabwe, is now disputing the veracity of his statement, arguing that it was fabricated after he was assaulted by the police, according to Sowetanlive.com.

Chimboza, who runs a window-tinting business, claims that while he did stab Manona to death, he can’t remember taking out the heart and eating it.

The brutal attack took place on the evening of June 10.

Chimboza confirmed to the hearing that Manona had called him certain names, that they then fought and that he had stabbed him to death.

He said: ‘The way I was continuously stabbing, that must have ripped his heart out. Because I was in a shocked state.’

Geyer retorted: ‘All the witnesses that were there confirm you killed the deceased, you cut out his heart and ate it. They say there was flesh in your teeth and dry blood on your mouth.’
