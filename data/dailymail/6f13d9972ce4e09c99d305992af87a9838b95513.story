A young teenage boy, who was rushed to hospital in a serious condition after collapsing from a head knock during a rugby league game on Saturday, is now in a stable condition.

The 13-year-old, playing for the Macarthur Saints, collided heads with an opposing player and left the field for treatment, but was later allowed to resume play in the match with Campbelltown, south west of Sydney.Â 

When he returned to the field he then suffered an elbow knock to the head and collapsed. The teenager was flown by helicopter to the Westmead Children's Hospital where a spokesperson told MailOnline he remained in a stable but serious condition.

But the boy's condition improved overnight and he is now in a stable condition.

The incident follows a series of serious injuries involving school-aged boys playing contact sport in NSW.

Year 11 student Tyler Horton suffered a head injury in a match between Bathurst High School and Dubbo College, in the state's central west, on Thursday. Tyler, 16, was flown to the Children's Hospital at Westmead where he remains in an induced coma.

Another player Curtis Landers, who played for the Forster-Tuncurry Hawks, was left paralysed by a horror tackle that fractured his c2 and c3 vertebrae. Club president Aaron Temple said he faced an uphill battled to recovery.

'He's looking at 12 months in hospital,' he told MailOnline.

Curtis is making small steps towards getting better, and is now swallowing and eating ice cream on his own as he recovers. He has also started gym sessions and his arms and legs are improving.
