The mother of 3-year-old Mikaeel Kular is a 'demon' for brutally killing her son, hiding the body then claiming he was lost, according to the boy's father.

Zahid Saeed, 30, has spoken publicly for the first time about the death of his son at the hands of Rosdeep Adekoya.

She was charged with murder but pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide and attempting to defeat the ends of justice at the High Court in Edinburgh on Friday.

Speaking to the Sun on Sunday, Mr Saeed said: 'She's a demon. She should suffer every day.

'She's not a monster - not even a monster or animal would kill their own child.'

Mr Saeed, of Guardbridge, Fife, said that in his opinion justice should be an eye for an eye.

He said: 'But I don't want her to rot in hell, I want her to live for eternity so she can remember what she has done and live with the guilt.

Mr Saeed was in court to hear details of how Adekoya, 34, repeatedly beat Mikaeel before stuffing his lifeless body into a suitcase.

She lost her temper and assaulted the toddler after he was repeatedly sick following a family day out at a Nando's restaurant in Edinburgh on January 12.

After he died from his injuries at their city home two days later, she wrapped his body in a duvet cover, concealed it in the suitcase and drove 25 miles to Fife to hide it in woodland.

A major search was launched for the youngster after Adekoya phoned 999 and claimed her son was missing in an effort to conceal the crime.

She finally admitted to police: 'It was an accident and I panicked.'

Adekoya, a prisoner in Cornton Vale jail near Stirling, will be sentenced on August 25.

An independent significant case review will now be held after it emerged social services had stopped monitoring the family weeks before Mikaeel's death.

In the wake of Adekoya's guilty plea, social services have been accused of failing Mikaeel.

It has emerged Adekoya, 34, twice had her five children taken into care – but on both occasions, they were returned to her by social workers.

This was despite neighbours and even her own mother warning the authorities on many occasions that the children were being seriously neglected, left to sleep on filthy mattresses and abandoned for whole weekends while she went out partying with drug dealers, drinking and taking cocaine.

And when Adekoya – the daughter of a respectable Hertfordshire GP – moved from Fife to Edinburgh, social services failed to pass on the records about her.

This meant that no one was monitoring the welfare of three-year-old Mikaeel and his siblings in the weeks before his death.

A whistleblower from the local social services told the Mail: ‘The family were known to social services on and off from when the twins were born.’ The source said the tragedy ‘could have been prevented’ and that Mikaeel would still be alive but for the incompetence of social workers handling the case.

‘Rosie couldn’t cope with looking after them,’ she said. ‘In 2012 she had taken an overdose. There were constant cries for help.

'They were not properly monitored after they moved. There was no communication so Edinburgh did not even have a file on them when Mikaeel went missing.’
