It is the opening muggles have been waiting for - doubling the size of the famous Harry Potter attraction in Florida - and the movies' stars were out in full force as Diagon Alley finally swung open its doors.

Helena Bonham Carter, Warwick Davis and Evanna Lynch were on the red carpet at Universal Studios Florida as the wizarding street came to life, complete with fire-breathing dragon, imposing Gringotts Wizarding Bank and shops selling everything from wands to objects of the Dark Arts.

Speaking about the Orlando opening, the teenage wizard’s creator J.K. Rowling said: ‘I'm so pleased that The Wizarding World of Harry Potter has proved so popular to date, and I'm sure that the attention to detail in creating the new Diagon Alley area will make this an even better experience.’

Flaming success: The new Diagon Alley attraction in Orlando opened, complete with fire-breathing dragon

Reunited: Stars from the film, including Helena Bonham Carter (second left), Robbie Coltrane (centre), Tom Felton (second right) and Warwick Davis (centre front), launched the new Diagon Alley attraction

A small army of production staff has been working up to 100 hours a week to painstakingly recreate the alley from Fred and George Weasley’s joke shop through to the eerie Knockturn Alley.

Universal revealed that the Diagon Alley park will open to the public on July 8, and muggles will be able to take the Hogwarts Express from the existing The Wizarding World of Harry Potter park in Islands of Adventure, to the new area in Universal Studios.

A miniture London has even been created, so that the train ride feels like the authentic experience as visitors travel between Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, which is the secret wizarding street in the British capital.

Attention to detail: James and Oliver Phelps, who played the Weasley twins in the films, talk to the press outside an incredibly true-to-life Kings Cross station, where muggles can jump the Hogwarts Express to Hogsmeade

The Wizarding World of Harry Potter's Diagon Alley will officially open on July 8, allowing guests to experience even more of Harry Potter's adventures

New roles: Tom Felton, who played Dracoy Malfoy in the films, attended the launch and Helena Bonham Carter, who played Bellatrix Lestrange explained how she had to film new scenes for the Escape From Gringotts ride

But 
producers are proudest of the new ride, Escape From Gringotts, which 
focuses on a scene from the last book when Harry, Ron and Hermione try 
to steal a Horcrux from the closely-guarded bank, run by goblins.

Visitors
 will come face-to-face with a 60-foot dragon atop Gringotts, explore a 
labyrinth of vaults, and be dwarfed by the marble hall filled with 
goblins. They'll even spot Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort himself.

The
 ride will feature 360-degree themed sets, 4K digital high-definition 
animation, state-of-the-art 3D Infitec projection systems and include 
live special effects.

Located in the Universal Studios Florida theme park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Diagon Alley will feature shops, dining experiences and the next generation thrill ride, Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts

Enjoy the ride: Fans will be in for a 'multisensory' journey which will make them feel like they are trying to escape with Harry, Ron and Hermione

Centrepiece: Gringotts Bank and its spectacular ride were the main attraction at Diagon Alley when it opened to the public on July 8

Inside the bank, the chandeliers are made with more than 
26,000 crystals and the 60ft, fire-breathing Ukrainian 
Ironbelly dragon will stand guard over the high-security vaults, including the Lestrange Vault, at 
Gringotts Wizarding Bank.

Mark Woodbury, the president of Universal Creative, said: ‘Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts will change the way you think about theme park attractions.

‘We’ve created an entirely new type of ride that propels guests into the story like never before, and guests will remember it long after their visit to Diagon Alley.’

The level of detail in Diagon Alley is amazing, and nowhere are the features more fun and true to the novels and movies than in shop windows.

There are lots of things for sale, but others are simply great decorations. Books play a central role in the decor; window-shoppers will see animatronic versions of "The Monster Book of Monsters," a tome with teeth, along with self-knitting needles and Harry Potter's snowy owl, Hedwig.

With seven shops in Diagon Alley, there's plenty to buy (there are five shops in Hogsmeade, Universal's original Harry Potter attraction, which opened in 2010) from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasion and, Quality Quidditch Supplies to Scribbulus and Magical Menagerie.

On the more sinister side, Borgin and Burkes - located off Diagon Alley in the book, on Knockturn Alley - is a Dark Arts shop that sells skulls, black T-shirts and Death Eater masks.

In the money business: Fans will see all the lifelike goblins before they have even embarked on the ride

Feeling the heat: Riders will need to avoid the fiery breath of the Gringotts dragon
