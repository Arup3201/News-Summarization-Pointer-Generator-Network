An airplane made an emergency landing on a road in Sanger, Texas on Tuesday morning, damaging a power line and putting 50 homes and businesses in the dark for over an hour.

Federal Aviation Administration officials say that an engine problem forced the pilot of the Cessna 152 to land on Farm-to-Market Road 455 near Dyer Road a few minutes before 8:00 am.

Officials from the Texas Department of Public Safety say that a student pilot and a flying instructor were performing training maneuvers when the engine stopped functioning and the pilots clipped a power line before making a safe landing.

CBS reports that the student and instructor then pushed the plane out of the two lane road and onto a driveway so they could allow vehicles to pass by.

'They were in the area doing manoeuvres as part of the training process,' Texas Department of Public Safety Corporal Nick Hill told NBC.

'They started to experience engine issues at the particular point, began to elevate the plane, continued to experience engine issues and then began to land the plane on FM 455.'

While neither pilot was injured the plane's propeller and wing were damages.

Around 50 homes and businesses lost power on Wednesday morning for 90 minutes as a result of the clipped power line.
