An Illinois man was sentenced Wednesday to 30 months in prison for binding and blindfolding two of his children a year ago in a Wal-Mart parking lot in eastern Kansas in the belief they were possessed by demons.

Adolfo Gomez, 53, also was ordered to serve 24 months of post-release supervision after his prison term ends, said Cheryl Wright Kunard, a spokeswoman for the Douglas County district attorney's office.

Gomez and his wife, Deborah Gomez, were arrested June 13, 2012, in Lawrence after a woman saw a child bound and blindfolded near the family's vehicle.

Sentenced: Adolfo Gomez, the Chicago-area man who bound and blindfolded two of his children in a Kansas parking lot in the belief they were possessed, will now go to jail for nearly three years

Adolfo Gomez (left) and his wife Deborah Gomez were arrested after police discovered two of their five children bound and blindfolded in the parking lot of a Walmart store in Kansas last year. Adolfo has been sentenced to 30 months in prison.

Police reported finding two of their 
children, ages 5 and 7, bound by their hands and feet in the store 
parking lot, while three other children, ages 12, 13 and 15, were inside
the SUV unrestrained.

Adolfo
Gomez pleaded no contest in December to felony child abuse and child 
endangerment. Deborah Gomez was sentenced earlier to one year of 
probation after pleading no contest to child endangerment.

The
Gomezes told police they were in the parking lot because their vehicle 
had broken down on Interstate 70 near Lawrence on their way to Arizona.

Police Detective Randy Glidewell 
testified that when he interviewed Adolfo Gomez on the day of hisÂ  
arrest, the father said he had been listening to an online preacher
who was predicting the end of the world and that a 'darkness had come 
over the house' where the family lived in Northlake, Illinois

'And [they said] the world was coming to an end, and that's why they left,' Glidewell said.

The detective also said Adolfo Gomez 
told him he hadn't slept in nine days, and that Gomez was particularly 
concerned about one of the younger children.

One
of the older children told police the family believed demons were in 
their home and outside their SUV in the WalMart parking lot.

The child also said  the family had 
recently watched online videos about demons and 'a fallen angel'.

The older daughter said they were 
going to attempt to cast the demons out the younger children but did not
say how they planned to do that.

The family had been 
traveling from Illinois to see a family member in Arizona when their SUV
broke down on Interstate 70.

They stopped in Lawrence and
were in the Walmart parking lot when Linda Baranski, 64, called the 
police after seeing one of the bound children outside the vehicle in the
store's parking lot.

She said the child was sitting 'flat on the cement, and 
they were bound and I thought gagged, and they were rocking back and 
forth'.

'I thought it might have been some sort of abduction,' Baranski said during her testimony.

Baranski said Adolfo Gomez then caught her eye and appeared angry when he motioned for her to leave.

'He motioned in a kind of angry way 
as if to say get out of here,' Baranski said. She said she then pulled 
into a parking spot and called the police.

Adolfo Gomez told police the two younger children were acting out toward the older children in the vehicle during Bible studies.

The
Gomezs' three other children, aged 12, 13 and 15, were in the family's 
SUV unrestrained. All the children are now in protective custody.

Meanwhile, Adolfo Gomez has been arrested for several crimes, including three cases of driving while intoxicated.

He also spent time in prison on theft and burglary charges in the 1980s.
