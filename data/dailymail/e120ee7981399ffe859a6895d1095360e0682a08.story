NFL player Warren Sapp allegedly filmed a sex act with one of the two prostitutes he is accused of assaulting the night after the Super Bowl.

The two women told police that Sapp picked them up at the bar at the Renaissance Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, and that he threw $100 bills at them while they gave him a striptease in his room.

The New York Post reports that Sapp told police he paid each of the girls $300 to perform a sex act on him and filmed the one of the women, who is 23 years old.

Sapp reportedly showed this footage to police following the arrest.

Sapp said that one of the women demanded more money and both women started screaming at him when he said no.

'He told her several times that she needed to leave, but she was irate,' says a police report.

'At one point, she used Warren’s phone to call security to his room.'

During the argument Sapp allegedly tossed one of the woman out of his room, knocking the other woman down.

Sapp was fired by the NFL Network after the story broke last month. 

Sapp, a member of the Football Hall of Fame, was in town covering the big game for NFL Network.  

Storied career: Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders

The incident took place early Monday morning at Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix 

Sapp's biography has since been pulled from NFL Network's On-Air Talent list on its website.

The football analyst was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution and assault. 

He has since been released from custody without bail after a judge ruled that he was not a flight risk.

According to reporting by AZ Central, police were called to Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix at around 2.30am Monday after the incident in response to a noise complaint.  

A woman told officers that she and another woman were working as escorts and an argument over money in Sapp's room turned physical and spilled into the hallway.

Sapp admitted to investigators he had paid one of the women for sex but he denied any assault.

Investigators said both escorts sustained minor injuries consistent with a struggle. 

The women involved in the incident were cited by police and later released. 

Warren Sapp has been in trouble with the law several times in recent years.

In 2010, he was arrested on a domestic battery charge, which was later dropped.

Light on his feet: Sapp was the runner up on season 7 of Dancing With The Stars

As recently as last June, the 42-year-old football analyst and one-time contestant on Dancing With The Stars was picked up on a separate domestic battery charge in a Miami hotel.

Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders. He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. 

In recent years, Sapp, a divorced father of two, has been struggling with financial problems, which culminated in 2012 when he filed for bankruptcy listing $6.7million in debt, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid child support, property and IRS taxes.

In November of that year, the Super Bowl champion was forced to sell his palatial home in Florida for $2.1million.

Months earlier, Sapp auctioned off a 240-pair collection of rare Air Jordan sneakers worth $6,500 to pay his creditors.
