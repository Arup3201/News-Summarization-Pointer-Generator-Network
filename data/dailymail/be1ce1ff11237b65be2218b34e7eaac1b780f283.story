David Cameron complained that Ed Miliband was 'personally horrid' to him when they clashed during Prime Minister's Questions, MailOnline has learned.

The Labour leader tore into the PM at lunchtime, accusing him of being 'dodgy' and 'rotten' in one of the most aggressive clashes for months.

As Mr Cameron left the Chamber he complained to Tory ministers about the onslaught, claiming Mr Miliband had hit out 'because he was losing'.

Labour leader Ed Miliband tore into David Cameron in the Commons over tax avoidance, accusing him being 'rotten' in one of the most aggressive clashes for months

Prime Minister's Questions was dominated by angry exchanges over party donors and allegations of the wealthy using Swiss bank accounts with HSBC.

Former Conservative Party Treasurer Stanley Fink and German-born car manufacturing heir Georg von Opel, who has donated six-figure sums to the Tories, are among a host of individuals who legally held accounts in Switzerland with HSBC's private bank, according to a leaked tax disc. However, there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing.

Labour have also raised questions about why Mr Cameron hired former HSBC boss Stephen Green as a trade minister and Tory peer.

Mr Miliband turned his fire on the PM, claiming Tory donors hoarded money in Switzerland.

The Labour leader said his rival was 'bang to rights', adding: 'He can't get away from it – he's a dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors.'

He later blasted:  'There is something rotten at the heart of the Tory Party and it's you.'

Mr Cameron claimed that Labour had taken donations from people involved in the HSBC scandal.

But Mr Miliband responded: 'None of these people had given a penny on my watch and you are up to your neck in this.'

Leaving the Commons chamber after PMQs, Mr Cameron was overheard claiming Mr Miliband lashed out because he was losing

The session continued for around 15 minutes, with backbench MPs putting questions to the PM, before the two men went their separate ways.

However, Mr Cameron remained furious and was heard claiming the Labour leader has lashed out with increasingly aggressive attacks because he was not winning the battle.

It is understood Mr Cameron was overheard telling Conservative ministers as he left the Chamber: 'Ed was personally horrid to me because he was losing.'

Downing Street declined to comment on the remarks but senior Tories questioned what had happened to Labour promises to end so-called Punch and Judy politics.

A Conservative source said: 'We have heard all the stuff from Labour about how they want to change the tone and nature of PMQs but it does't seem to translate into the actual Wednesday lunchtime exchanges.' 

But the complaints attracted little sympathy. Labour MP Diane Abbott tweeted: 'So David Cameron complains Ed Mili was 'horrid' to him. Prime Minister, the last 5 years have been SO HORRID for so many across this country.'

Mr Cameron's unhappiness at the abuse from Mr Miliband comes after he branded the Labour leader a 'complete waste of space' in December and a 'complete shambles' last month.

Commons Speaker John Bercow had to intervene several times to call for calm as the exchanges became more fractious.

In one exchange Mr Miliband said: 'You took the money, you gave a job to the head of HSBC and you let the tax avoiders get away with it.

'There's something rotten at the heart of the Conservative Party and it's you.' 

But Mr Cameron insisted 'no-one had done more' than the current government to crack down on tax avoidance.

He told the Labour leader: 'I will tell you about the difference between you and me. When people donate to the Conservative Party they don't pick the candidates, they don't choose the policies, they don't elect the leader.

'When the trade unions fund the Labour Party they pay for the candidates, they pay for the policies, and the only reason you are sitting there is because a bunch of trade union leaders decided you were more left wing than your brother.'

Furious MPs have accused Britain’s tax authorities of 'failing' the public by letting thousands of people stash their cash in Swiss bank accounts.

The Chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge said she was furious at the 'pathetic' response to leaked HSBC files which showed thousands of British-linked individuals held bank accounts in Switzerland.

It came after revelations HM Revenue and Customs received a list of 6,800 HSBC customers with Swiss bank accounts five years ago – but had only managed to prosecute one person, despite £135million in owed tax being recovered.

Mrs Hodge said HMRC had failed to serve British taxpayers' interests in their response to the leak in 2010.

She laid the blame at the door of the tax authorities for failing to act on the leaked list of Swiss bank account owners.

She said the activities related to the Geneva branch of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary were 'pretty outrageous'.

She told HMRC chief Lin Homer that taxmen should have spoken to whistleblower Herve Falciani, who initially obtained the list while employed as an IT worker in 2007.

Ms Homer insisted that HMRC staff had been 'diligent' in their approach to the files, and said their record of securing one conviction and £135 million in unpaid tax, fines and interest compared well with other countries.

But Ms Hodge told her that the French tax authorities had recouped £200 million from 3,000 names and the Spanish £180 million from 2,900.

And she told the HMRC chief: 'It's pretty outrageous what was going on.

'It's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance, but of tax evasion, and that is incredibly serious.

'For you to sit there and say, as you are doing, that ‘We couldn't get the money in in the same way as the French and Spanish did’ and ‘We didn't litigate because we wanted to get the money in’ and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the British taxpayer.'

Responding to Ms Hodge's comments, Ms Homer insisted: ‘That is absolutely not the case.’

Some 300 staff, led by three directors, had been sifting through the data supplied by French authorities in 2010 and had traced 3,200 individuals, including 150 ‘most serious’ cases which could be considered for criminal prosecution, 500 which were ‘more serious’ but not likely to meet the criminal threshold and 400-500 which could be pursued for disclosure and settlement.

Ms Homer, who was appointed to lead HMRC in 2012, said she believed the authority would have told Government ministers about the data within months of receiving it.

‘We are confident we will have told ministers that we were about to receive a big tranche of operational information,’ she said. ‘We will have told people, including ministers, I suspect some time in the next few months.’

HMRC had previously told the committee that it hoped to bring about 15 cases to prosecution, but in the event three were passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service, which decided to take just one to court.
