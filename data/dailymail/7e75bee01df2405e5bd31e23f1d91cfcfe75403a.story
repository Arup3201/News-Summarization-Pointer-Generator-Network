A football-mad boyfriend cut short a romantic holiday in Mexico with his girlfriend - to fly back home to play for his village pub team.

Chris Jones, 26, from Cardiff, borrowed £1,100 from his mum to get on a plane to make the 5,000-mile trip home halfway through the dream trip.

The delivery driver was on a two-week holiday to Cancun with girlfriend Sarah Walker when he discovered his team had been picked to play at a Premier League stadium.

Dream holiday: Chris Jones, who plays for Max United, cut his Mexico trip short to play for his team

Stunning location: The trip to Playa del Carmen was the couple's first holiday for six years

And Chris had to tell Sarah, 25, he was blowing the whistle on their first holiday for six years.

Chris said: ‘Luckily for me Sarah knows I am obsessed with footie - she was fairly understanding.

‘But it was a bit tough telling her I wanted to leave the sun-kissed beaches of Mexico to fly home to Cardiff for a match.’

The pair had saved up for the romantic all-inclusive holiday in Playa Del Carmen.

They spent the first week sunbathing, jet skiing, strolling along the palm fringed beaches and eating in top restaurants.

Big match: Football-obsessed Chris said he wouldn't miss the chance to play for his team at Cardiff City Stadium

Long way home: Chris had to ask his mum for the £1,100 to pay for the flights back to the UK

But Chris checked his Facebook page and discovered his team Max Utd had been picked to play at the Cardiff City stadium.

Chris is the club's top scorer with 23 goals this season so he knew he had to be there.

He said: ‘I would describe myself as obsessed with football - I play every Saturday and Sunday and then five-a-side twice a week.

‘If I had missed this I would have been gutted - of all the players in the club it probably means more to me than anybody.

‘To play in a premiership standard stadium is a dream come true.’

Chris couldn't afford the air fare home but his mum Lesley Jones, 47, offered to pay - forking out for a return trip because it was impossible to buy a single.

The couple took a nine-hour flight back to Gatwick Airport and were back in Cardiff ready for the kick off against pub side.

Dream destination: The couple had booked a two-week trip to Cancun, which was cut short

Chris, of Tonypandy, near Cardiff, said: ‘Sarah was a bit upset but she is alright about it now.

‘But she warned me she'll be bringing it up again in future, she got a lot of credit.’

Sarah said: ‘We were having a great time in Mexico but I know how much football means to him.

‘The weather we had was really good but it was changing when we left and looked like rain, so it worked out well.’

Amateur clubs in South Wales were asked why their team deserved the unique opportunity to play at the 27,000-seater Cardiff City Stadium Max United and pub team the Maltsters Arms won the chance to play each other.

Chris's mum Lesley Jones, 47, said: ‘I knew he would want to come back and play but he's always been football mad.’
