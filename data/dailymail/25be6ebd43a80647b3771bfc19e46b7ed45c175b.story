Three childhood friends who survived the Second World War together have been reunited after 70 years apart.

With the war coming to an end in 1945, brothers Sydney and Bernard Baker waved goodbye to their adopted home on Pwllygath Street near Bridgend, Wales - and their dear friend Doris Hayball.

Along with their other brother Alan, they returned to the family home in Stamford Hill, London which they had been evacuated from five years earlier.

Now thanks to a chance meeting with a couple from the town in Gran Canaria, the pair have rekindled that friendship with their fellow wartime survivor on the same Welsh street they left behind.

Homecoming: With the war coming to an end in 1945 - Bernard (standing), Sydney (right) and their other brother Alan (left) returned home to London which they had evacuated five years earlier

Reunion: Thanks to Sydney's chance meeting with a current Pwllygath Street resident in Gran Canaria, the pair have been able to return to the street that took them in during the war - and see some old friends

84-year-old Bernard who now lives in Essex said: 'It's wonderful coming back. I have always got a smile about being in Wales. It was a very, very happy time and it was safe for my brothers and me.'

Doris, 82, still lives at her childhood home four doors down from where the Baker brothers stayed.

The great-grandmother who now goes by the name Doris Lugg remembers them arriving on Pwllygath Street wearing gas masks and clutching their small suitcases.

She said: 'It's really amazing to see them again. I remember them coming into the street with a lady who brought them up from Pisgah Church.'

Despite the fear which gripped the country during the war, Sydney, 80, added: 'I don't remember any time being sad or unhappy.'

He said bumping into current Kenfig Hill resident Jane Holder while on holiday with his wife Carole 'brought back a flood of memories of all that happened'.

Jane, 50, and her husband Richard arranged for the Baker brothers to return to Bridgend yesterday, where they even managed to visit their old school Mynydd Cynffig.

They had kept in touch with Ed and Laura Williams who looked after them between 1940 and 1945 but feared the links with their childhood in Wales ended when the couple died.

Memories: Doris, who remembers the boys arriving in Kenfig Hill wearing gas masks and clutching their tiny suitcases, said: 'It's really amazing to see them again'

Kindness: The brothers were initially homed separately but the couple who took in Alan decided they should all be staying together 

Thankfully, Jane discovered that many of their former schoolmates remembered the trio - known as the Baker boys - and would be delighted to see them again.

The three boys were initially sent to separate home but Doris' second cousin Ed Williams - who took in Alan - decided they should be together when he saw Sydney crying in a window of a neighbour's house.

Doris said: 'He told my mother he couldn't bear it that they were parted.'

Even though the brothers shared two single beds pushed together in a box room for five years, Bernard and Sydney remember their stay in Wales fondly.

Sydney said: 'Laura and Ed were wonderful people - incredibly warm almost immediately.

And his brother Bernard added: 'It was incredible for them to take three Jewish boys in. But they brought us up like their own children.

'I couldn't have hoped for a better, happier boyhood than I had here.'
