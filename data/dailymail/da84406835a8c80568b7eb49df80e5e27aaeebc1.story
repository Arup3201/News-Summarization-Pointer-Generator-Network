Ponocos cop killer Eric Frein wrote a chilling description of his cold-blooded sniper attack on a Pennsylvania State Police barracks in which he shot dead one trooper and gravely wounded a second. 

'Friday, September 12, got a shot around 11pm, he dropped. I was surprised at how quick,' the diary reads.

'I took a follow-up shot on his head and neck area. He was still and quiet after that. 

'Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him, one jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still. 

'I ran back to the Jeep.'

Eric Frein is a survivalist and marksman who has eluded police for nearly a month after a sniper attack on a Pennsylvania State Police barracks that left one trooper dead and another critically wounded

Pennsylvania State Police released these digitally-enhanced pictures of Frein that show him with a beard and with a Mowhawk, which they believe he trimmed his hair into

The diary, which Frein wrote while on the run from an exhaustive police manhunt, was found September 29 at campsite that officers stumbled on in the woods near his home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, in the Pocono Mountains.  

State police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens, read passages from the multipage journal at a press conference today.  

Corporal Bryon K Dickson II, 38, was killed in the attack on September 12 in Pike County as he stepped outside during a shift change. Trooper Alex T Douglass, 31, was critically wounded when he ran over to help Cpl Dickson. 

Lt Col Bivens said the diary makes no mention of Frein knowing either trooper - or even that he was intending to target any one individual. 

Instead, in sets out Frein's desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder. 

Some had speculated that Frein deliberately targeted Trooper Douglass because he was friends with Frein's sister-in-law.  

State police released two new photos of the campsite they found in the woods near Frein's home. He has been evading police for nearly a month

The announcement comes as police released a digitally altered picture of Frein showing him with a beard and a Mohawk, which they believe he cut his hair into.

Authorities also released new pictures of Frein's campsite - including a cluster of rocks he was using for shelter.  

His journal describes how Frein fled in a Jeep, but ran it into a swamp and took off on foot, a botched getaway Frein termed a 'disaster,' said Bivens, who described the document as a 'cold-blooded and absolutely chilling account.'

The journal was found September 29, when authorities discovered a campsite at which they also found explosives, ammunition, food, water and clothing.

Hundreds of law enforcement officials have been looking for Frein — described by authorities as a survivalist and expert marksman with a grudge against law enforcement — in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis, in the Pocono Mountains.

Officers believe they have spotted Frein in the woods, but the distance and rugged terrain allowed him to slip away.

The most recent sighting came Tuesday afternoon, when an officer thought he spotted a brief glimpse of Frein from about 200 yards away, Bivens said. That was the fourth sighting by police or the community since Friday, he said.

'We will get Frein. Whether that is today, whether that is tomorrow or whether that is next week, remains to be seen,' Bivens said. 

Fri Sept 12th got a shot around 11 pm and took it ... . He dropped ... I was surprised at how quick.

I took a follow up shot on his head ... neck area ... . He was still and quiet after.

Another cop approached the one I just shot.

As he went to kneel I took a shot at him and jumped in the door.

His legs were visible and still.

I ran back to the Jeep.

I made maybe half a mile from the GL (game lands) road and hit a road block.

I didn't expect one so soon. It was only 15-20 min.

I did a K-turn 1⁄4 a mile from them and pulled into a development I knew had unfinished access road.

Hearing helos I just used my marker lights missed the trail around a run off pool and drove straight into it. !Disaster!

Made half attempt to stash AK and ran.
