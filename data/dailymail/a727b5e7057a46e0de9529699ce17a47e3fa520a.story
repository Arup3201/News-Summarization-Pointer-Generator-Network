Defense attorneys for the Arizona woman accused of stabbing her ex-boyfriend to death 27 times presented emails in court Thursday in which the victim, a devout Mormon, called his former paramour a 's***' and a 'w****.'

Jodi Arias, 32, is on trial for allegedly murdering 30-year-old Travis Alexander by stabbing him in the shower, slitting his throat and then shooting him in the face in June 2008, months after the two had broken up.

Arias, a photographer who had dated 
Alexander for nearly five months in 2007, has been in jail since her 
arrest. She has pleaded not-guilty to first degree murder. If convicted, Arias could become the fourth woman on Arizona's death row.

On Thursday, jurors heard testimony from lead detective Esteban Flores and a recording of a conversation he had with Arias in June 2008.

On the call, Arias denied being involved in the death and calmly told the detective that she had not seen Alexander in two months.

According to Flores, the defendant told him during questioning that she and Alexander were so distrustful of each other that they shared their Facebook, MySpace and Gmail passwords in a failed bid to patch up their unraveling relationship, ABC News reported.

During the first full day of testimony, the prosecution introduced emails between the couple. On cross examination, defense attorney Kirk Nurmi asked Flores whether Alexander referred to his ex-girlfriend in those missives as a s*** and a w****, to which he detective answered in the affirmative.

Flores testified that the communique included the 30-year-old Mormon writing to Arias: 'I think I was little more than a dildo with a heartbeat to you.'

Attorneys in the trial painted opposing pictures of Alexander, with prosecutors describing him as a person of faith and a 'good man,' and the defense saying he was violent and abusive.

Prosecutors argue Arias was a jealous woman who brutally attacked Alexander after he tried to end their relationship.

'This is not a case of whodunit,' Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Juan Martinez said in his opening statement. 'The person who committed this killing sits in court today - Jodi Ann Arias.'

Jennifer Willmott, an attorney for Arias, told jurors her client acted in self-defense after Alexander 'lunged at Jodi in anger' in his suburban Mesa home after she dropped his new camera.

'Jodi's life was in danger. He knocked her to the ground in the bathroom where there was a struggle,' Willmott said. 'If she did not have to defend herself, she would not be here.'

Motive: The prosecution claimed that Arias flew into a jealous rage after learning that Alexander wanted to date another woman

Possessive: The defense described Alexander as abusive and controlling

Since the murder, investigators said Arias has changed her story three times. Initially, the woman denied being at the scene of the crime until officials found her bloody hand-print on the floor of Alexander's bathroom.

Arias later told police that two masked intruders attacked her and killed Alexander, and she didn't call police because she was scared.

She then offered an alternative version of events, claiming that she killed Alexander in self-defense because he got violent.

Alexander had told friends Arias had become too possessive and was acting like a stalker, so he ended their relationship to see other women. But phone and email records indicate the pair continued to carry on a sexual relationship, The Arizona Republic reported.

Story: Arias offered investigators three different versions of events ranging from her denial of being at the scene of the crime to claims of self-defense

Flores downplayed the stalker description, saying Alexander was inviting Arias to his home and the phone calls between them 'were back and forth.'

Arias' attorneys have said she was not the sexual instigator in the relationship and pointed to provocative photos Alexander had sent her in an attempt to paint him as a sexual deviant who sought to control his on-again, off-again lover.

Willmott showed the jury a T-shirt she says he made Arias wear emblazoned with the phrase 'Travis Alexander's' across the front.

'That t-shirt is the perfect example of how Travis treated her,' she said.

According to court records filed by Arias' attorneys, Alexander persuaded her to come to his home on June 4, 2008. They claim the couple had sex, then took provocative photographs of each other, one even showing Alexander posing naked in the shower.

Authorities said a camera found in the washing machine at Alexander's home contained a memory card with the photos, including one taken minutes after Alexander posed naked showing his bloody body in the shower. 

Another photo allegedly showed Arias dragging Alexander across the floor.

Travis Alexander and Jodi Arias were involved in a rough sexual relationship before the death of Alexander in June 2008

Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference

The couple had met at a work 
conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the 
phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 
emails.

They started dating
 in 
February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias 
telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.

In jail: Arias claimed she had nothing to do with the murder but later said it was out of self defense

In December 2007, Alexander 
began dating another girl and allegedly told friends that Arias became so jealous that she 
slashed the tyres on his car twice.

In June 2008, Alexander told friends he thought Arias might have hacked 
into his Facebook account and told her to stay away.

Yet on June 4, she visited his home and they had sex before he was murdered. She later told police that they had maintained a secret sexual relationship despite breaking up, ABC reported.

'There's nothing about her that I see in
 marriage material - or wife material,' Alexander had said, according to 
his friend, Dave Hall. 'But it's hard to say no to a woman that sneaks 
into your house, crawls in your bed and tries to, you know, seduce you.'

At first she denied being at his 
house the day he was killed, yet police found a camera in 
Alexander's washing machine containing graphic pictures of the pair having sex.

The water-logged camera, which belonged to
 Alexander, had been damaged in the washing machine, but the Mesa police crime lab was able to recover images, some of which had been deleted.

Among those deleted were pictures showing Alexander posing naked in the shower at 5.22pm, with the last picture
 showing him alive at 5.30pm. Later photos showed him bleeding 
while on the floor.

The camera also contained pictures of Arias posing naked on
 Alexander's bed at 1.40pm.

On June 9, his friends went to his upscale home after he had failed to return their calls. They found him dead in his shower and his body was 'well into the decomposition process'.

Missed: Alexander, a motivational speaker from Arizona, was found several days after the killing

Wounds show that Alexander attempted 
to fight back, court records show. An autopsy found he sustained 27 puncture 
wounds and one gunshot wound, with the bullet found in his left cheek.

Investigators also found a bloody left palm print with Arias' DNA on the bathroom wall. Her DNA was also found 
in hair recovered from a bloody wall, according to the Arizona Republic.

After initially claiming that she had not been at his home that day, Arias changed her story to admit she had been there - but had not killed her ex-boyfriend.

'I witnessed Travis being attacked by 
two other individuals,' she told Inside Edition. 'Who were they? I 
don't know. I couldn't pick them up in a police lineup.'

Deceit: Police found a camera in Alexander's washing machine, pictured, that contained pictures of him having sex with Arias on the day of the killing. There were also pictures of his dead body

She later changed her story once 
again, telling the court that she killed Alexander in self defense after
 he became angry when she dropped his camera.

She claims he had been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship.

'It makes me sick because I know her 
true side,' Steven Alexander, Travis Alexander's brother, told ABC. 'And I ask people to please not buy into 
this sweet innocent personality that she puts on.'

As well as the inconsistencies in her story, Arias' case has been plagued with difficulties with her legal representation. 

She asked to represent herself but 
when she submitted letters to the court that she claimed Alexander had 
written - saying he was a pedophile - they were found to be forgeries, and she told a judge she was in 'over her head'.

In court: Arias has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder but prosecutors want the death penalty

Her defense team was reinstated but in December 2011, her attorney, Victoria Washington, was granted a motion to withdraw from the case.

Jennifer Willmott, a death penalty-qualified defense attorney, had now been assigned to represent Arias. In January 2012, a judge denied a motion asking for the death penalty to be rejected.
