Vince Cable has been branded a 'socialist' and unfit for office by one of David Cameron's top advisers.

In a stinging attack on the Business Secretary, Adrian Beecroft, whose controversial employment reform report was published yesterday, says Mr Cable 'appears to do very little to support business' despite being in charge of it in Britain.

Nick Clegg also regularly 'threatens to go nuclear' and dissolve the Coalition 'if he doesn’t get his way', the venture capitalist also claimed, adding the Lib Dems are damaging the UK economy. 

Mr Beecroft's blueprint for work reforms, asked for by Downing Street, proposed small firms be exempted from rules on unfair dismissal, company pensions, flexible working rights and even employing children.

But Lib Dems, led by Vince Cable, insisted a dilution of workers' rights on such a scale was unthinkable and argued that it would hit consumer confidence, branding Beecroft's recommendations 'bonkers'.

It came as yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister was branded a communist for declaring Britain a nation of snobs.

Universities should favour promising state school applicants, even if they had worse grades than private school rival, he said, but Tim Hands, master of Magdalen College School in Oxford, said the plan was ‘old-style communist'.

In an interview with the Telegraph today Mr Beecroft said the Business Secretary’s objections to his report are 'ideological not economic'. 'I think he is a socialist who found a home in the Lib Dems, so he’s one of the Left,' he added.

'I think people find it very odd that he’s in charge of business and yet appears to do very little to support business.'

And in a direct attack on the party he has donated thousands to, he called on the Tories to stand up to their Lib Dem Coalition partners.

'I do think they (the Tories) are hugely held back by the Lib Dems. I think you could put together a bunch of suggestions out of the report, as a coherent programme, that would say, you know, we are tackling the issues that business has with employment law but the Lib Dems will have none of it,' he said.

Tantrums: Mr Beecroft claims that Nick Clegg threatens to break-up the Coalition if he doesn't get his own way and the PM should stand up to him more

'Nick Clegg is always threatening to go nuclear and dissolve the whole thing if he doesn’t get his way with this, that and the other. Which you’d think actually must be a hollow threat. Therefore, why can’t the Government be more robust? I don’t know what the answer is. But it is disappointing.'

In a speech yesterday Mr Clegg suggested society was as dominated by class as it had been almost a century ago, and universities should favour promising state school applicants, even if they had worse grades than private school rivals. Those who ignored it would be fined, he said.

But his comments sparked a backlash from the independent school sector.

Tim Hands, master of Magdalen College School in Oxford, said Mr Clegg’s plan was the ‘old-style communist creation of a closed market’ that betrayed parents who paid for a private education.

‘Many parents make huge sacrifices in order to get the best possible education for their children. Privileged politicians propose to betray those parents and their values.

But venture capitalist Mr Beecroft's anger was also aimed directly at the Prime Minister.

David Cameron was accused last night of giving up on plans to reform unfair dismissal laws by the author of an official report on boosting jobs and growth.

Downing Street doctored it, it has been claimed, with eight pages of the original 'independent' document removed or tampered with.

It came at a time when the Prime Minister was forced to apologise for aiming sexist comments at a female MP in Parliament including the infamous 'calm down dear' attack, and the Tories feared they were alienating women voters. 

It appears the report was changed before it was sent to Vince Cable's Business department last October, despite Mr Cameron's own advisers telling him that he was risking Britain's economic recovery by doing so.

These experts said that the Coalition's policies were too family-friendly, and this was not good for business or growth.

Today Mr Beecroft suggested the Prime Minister was reneging on a deal to make it easier for small firms to fire failing staff.

Mr Beecroft told the Daily Mail the move would make businesses more likely to take people on, and expressed frustration that the Conservatives had not been 'firmer' in the face of Lib Dem objections.

'It's very difficult having a coalition between a centre-right party and a party a lot of whose ideas are very left,' said the Conservative donor.

'It means striking compromises, and things that a centre, middle person like me would think are good ideas just don't happen.

'It's impossible to know from the outside where Conservatives could be firmer and insisting on things. But I do think it is disappointing that they appear to have given up on unfair dismissal.'
