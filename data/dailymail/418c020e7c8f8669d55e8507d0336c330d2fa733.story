With a mustache and fine crop of hair, Today show host Lester Holt looks completely different twenty-something years ago compared to his current self.

The 54-year-old, father-of-two joined colleagues in sharing intimate throwback family photos to mark Jenna Wolfe's return from maternity leave this weekend.

He said that he can hardly believe where the time has gone and it only feels like yesterday when he was rocking his two sons, now in their twenties, 'with one hand'.

Fast-forwarding two decades or so, a recent shot shows the 6ft 2in TV anchor matched in height by his eldest son, Cameron.

He said: 'The one thing Jenna will find out 
and everybody says this to new parents, "Oh, it happens so fast. They'll
 grow up before you know it." [Well], trust me, it does.'

Offering 39-year-old Ms Wolfe words of encouragement and support, she said: 'Take it day-by-day and when you go home make sure you give your little one an even bigger hug.

'The great thing Jenna is that you don't
 have to 
worry. There is a lot of us who have been there, done that, We'll help 
guide you through it. We'll hold your hand every step of the way.'

Erica
 Hill, 37, also a mother of two boys, put forward a photograph of her at

She said the best advice she received after becoming a mother for the first time, was to 'focus on the task at hand.'  

'If
 you're at work, focus on work and when you're with your baby focus on 
her,' she recommended to Ms Wolfe, who gave birth to a baby girl named Harper Estelle on August 21.

'The more you can focus on the 
positive in every situation, the better every situation is. even when 
you're traveling, think of it as a chance to sleep late more. When 
you're at home, think about it as much time with Harper.

'Then when you're back at work, think how excited you are to hang out with us again.'

'I think what Harper is going to see 
is we are two women who are, although very focused on our careers and 
passionate about them, are also very passionate about her and care about
 her and that she's the priority. For her to be able to see that, I think is 
great '

Jenna Bush Hager, 32, who became a 
mother for the first time in April, recalled that she was 'ready' to get
 back to the studios after four months off but missed being with her 
'babe 24 hours a day'.

She
 says that bath time is the perfect opportunity for mother-baby bonding 
after a long day at work and when she's away traveling she gets her 
husband to send videos of their daughter Mila 'every night'.

Ms
 Wolfe's partner, Stephanie Gosk, who returned to work shortly after the
 birth of their child, also admitted that it 
wasn't an easy transition.

'It's tough. You get used to that non- stop time with the baby and the connection you make.

'When you come to work, it's a huge chunk of your day where you're not with her, and it's tough.'
