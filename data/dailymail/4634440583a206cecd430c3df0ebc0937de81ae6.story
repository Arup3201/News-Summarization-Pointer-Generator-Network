He was one of the UK's most controversial fashion stars, a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs.

Now a retrospective of Alexander McQueen's work is to go on display at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, with pieces taken from his ground-breaking 1992 MA collection shown alongside his last.

Savage Beauty, which opens next month but had a preview for A-List stars this evening, includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by McQueen's friends, among them stylist Katy England.

McQueen, who was found dead on the 11th February 2010, was one of the UK's most influential designers at the time of his death and was the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors.

The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters.

After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career.

McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter.

Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow.

From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans.

The same year, he was appointed creative director at Givenchy, replacing fellow Briton John Galliano, and relocated to Paris. But despite his success, McQueen never forgot his London roots, often speaking of his love for the British capital.

Indeed, he once spoke of how inspiring he found the V&A itself, saying: 'The collections at the V&A never fail to intrigue and inspire me. The nation is privileged to have access to such a resource... it's the sort of place I'd like to be shut in overnight.'

The museum repaid the compliment, first by including the designer's work in Cutting Edge: 50 Years of British Fashion in 1997, and then again in its Fashion in Motion series.

But it is the new Savage Beauty retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of McQueen's work hosted by the museum, with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show.

Among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection, as well as some of his A/W10 designs - the last the designer would ever create.

His final collection was never completed, with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in Paris a month after he died. But while McQueen might be gone, his brand lives on and, in the capable hands of his former assistant Sarah Burton, continues to go from strength to strength.

'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired,' she explains. 'He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless. Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.'

'I am thrilled to announce that the V&A will bring this wonderful exhibition to London to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times,' adds V&A director Martin Roth.

'Lee Alexander McQueen was brought up in London, studied here and based his globally successful McQueen fashion brand here – by staging the exhibition at the V&A it feels like we are bringing his work home.'

Dramatic:  McQueen was famous for producing pieces that erred on the side of gothic such as these three dresses

Spectacular: Victoriana and bold blooms were also recurring motifs, as these striking gowns make plain

Setting the scene: Savage Beauty opens at the V&A next month, with tickets due to go on sale on the 14th March

The stars turned out in force for the party the V&A held this evening to celebrate the arrival of the exhibition. 

Supermodels including Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Erin O'Connor all showed up at the event in dresses by the late designer. 

A-List names from the world of acting also showed up to view the designs, including Colin Firth and Laura Carmichael, while David and Victoria Beckham put in an appearance too. 

Princess Beatrice flew the flag for the British royals, turning heads as she arrived in a black tuxedo-style dress that was split to the thigh. 

Jamie Hince and Kate Moss also attended the exhibition 

David and Victoria Beckham were also invited to the event

There's no denying that Victoria Beckham is now officially part of the fashion elite. Her catwalk collections are met with as much respect as the long-established labels, as well as becoming a style icon herself.

Attending the opening night of the 'Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty' exhibition, Victoria demonstrated both of our points by looking stunning in a dress from her own brand.

The strapless design gave it a chic look, but the bold cut-out features provided an edgy fashion-forward streak to the look. Naturally, when you're the head of a brand getting a custom made frock is not a problem, explaining why you can only spot a slightly shorter skirt version of this same cut-out design on the recent Autumn/Winter catwalk.

You might not be able to get our hands on this exact custom made dress, but not only can you click right to shop the current VB range at Net-a-Porter, but you can also get inspired by Victoria's look with our edit of strapless dresses below. Just pair with some black pumps and pout like there's no tomorrow!
