The popularity of smartphones means that children are taking an average of £120-worth of gadgets with them to school.

One in 10 children aged between six and ten also takes a tablet device while 22 per cent of mothers say their child's items are worth more than those they carry in their handbag.

Research has found that the contents of school bags across the country are worth almost £1billion.

Go go gadget: The average school bag contains electronic devices worth more than £120, with more than half of 11 to 16 year olds carrying a smartphone in theirs

But less than a fifth of parents say that they have sufficient insurance to cover what's in their child's school bag even though 19 per cent of parents say they know the bag is left unattended in public.

Around half of those that do have personal possessions insurance say that they do not understand their policy.

Jane Symonds, spokesman for the Money Advice Service said: 'Electronic devices are so integral to our everyday lives now.

'It's incredible how quickly they have become "must-have" items - even for children as young as six years old.

'Given how attached we get to essential items such as smartphones or e-readers, it's worrying how many parents don't fully understand which valuables are covered by their insurance policies.'

In total, 2,000 UK parents of children aged between six to 16-years-old were surveyed.

The
research asked parents of two age groups - six to 10 and 11-16-year 
olds - and showed that younger school children are not far behind their 
older peers in the gadget stakes.

The
research found nine per cent of children aged six to 10 take a tablet 
device such as an iPad to school, compared to 11 per cent in the older 
age group.

Costly: More than a fifth of mothers say that whats in their child's schoolbag is worth more than what's in their handbag

More than half of 11 to 16-year-olds now take a smartphone to school, compared to 17 per cent of six to 10-year-olds.

The average value of electronic devices taken to school by six to 10-year-olds is £81, while it is £159 for those aged 11 to 16.

Schoolchildren in London carry bags with the highest average contents value at £138.

The region with the lowest value is East Anglia, at £103, where a third of schoolchildren do not take any electronic devices to school with them at all.
