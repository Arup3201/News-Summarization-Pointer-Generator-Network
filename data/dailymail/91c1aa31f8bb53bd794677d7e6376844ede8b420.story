Back on Twitter: As his trial over the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp draws to a close, the Paralympic athlete spent Sunday afternoon on the social networking site

Oscar Pistorius has broken his Twitter silence with a series of bizarre tweets including photos of him posing with children and a passage from the memoir of an Auschwitz survivor.

As his trial for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp draws to a close, the Paralympic athlete spent Sunday afternoon on the social networking site.

The last time he left a message was on February 14th, the first anniversary of the day he shot dead Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door of his Pretoria home.

In one of the tweets, he posted a photograph of his finger resting on a page from Victor Frankl's memoir, Man's Search for Meaning, in which the Austrian psychiatrist recounts his time as a prisoner at Auschwitz death camp during the Second World War.

The passage included the words: 'The salvation of man is through love and in love.

'I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.'

In another tweet, he attached a collage of photographs of him helping children with disabilities around the passage: 'You have the ability to make a difference in someones life.

'Sometimes it's the simple things you say or do that can make someone feel better or inspire them.'

Finally, the South African known as 'The Blade Runner' posted a message that read: 'Lord, today I ask that you bathe those who live in pain in the river of your healing. Amen.'

Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his law graduate and model girlfriend Miss Steenkamp, whom he shot and killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year.

He could also be sentenced to a shorter prison term if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing. Additionally, he faces separate gun-related charges.

The tweets come three days after Pistorius' defence team closed its case in the murder trial of the Olympic athlete.

Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says the prosecution will file closing arguments on July 30 and the defence will do so on August 4.

The 27-year-old athlete says he killed Steenkamp by mistake, thinking an intruder was in the toilet and about to attack him.

The prosecution says he shot her after a Valentine's Day argument last year.

Pistorius was born without fibulas, the slender bones that run from below the knee to the ankle. Part of his lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old.

Last week saw Mr Nel challenge the credibility of a physician who testified that the athlete has an anxious nature linked to his disability.

Mr Nel said the defense witness, physician Wayne Derman, could not be objective about the double-amputee runner.

The defence maintains that Pistorius has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime, and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house.

Under questioning, Derman acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a 'forensic report' but disputed Mr Nel's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with Pistorius, having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively.
