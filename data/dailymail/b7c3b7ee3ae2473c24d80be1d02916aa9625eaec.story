Dramatic new details have emerged of how the hero Sergeant-at-Arms dived onto the floor from behind a pillar and shot the Muslim convert who attacked the Canadian parliament.

Kevin Vickers was in his office when he heard masked gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fire a flurry of bullets while running down the Hall of Honour towards the doors to the Parliamentary Library.

He immediately picked up his firearm, left his office and hid behind a pillar just an 'arm's length' from where the shooter was hiding. Apparently he could see the barrel of Bibeau's gun as he stood, waiting.

Hero: Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, pictured shaking hands with Canadian prime Minister Stephen Harper, was in his office when he heard masked gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fire a flurry of bullets

Pictured receiving a standing ovation from Canadian MPs this week, he immediately picked up his firearm, left his office and hid behind a killer just an 'arm's length' after from where the shooter was hiding. 

His security team ran down the hall, warning him that the suspect was hiding in the alcove around the corner. 

Sources said after Mr Vickers knew he had killed the shooter, he calmly returned to his office to reload, in case there was any further threat.  

The vital actions from Mr Vickers, who has been labelled a 'hero' by his peers, all took place while the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper hid in a cupboard inside the Conservative caucus. 

Mr Vickers went to the door, identified himself then took the microphone at the front of the room  

During the ordeal, MPs sharpened flagpoles to use as spears and barricaded the doors while Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau exchanged dozens of shots with guards inside Canada's Parliament building.

He fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the War Memorial in Ottowa on Wednesday morning.

Politicians have now returned to the city's Parliament Hill complex, where Mr Harper said the Canadian government would 'be vigilant' to threats but 'not run scared'.

'We will always stand together,' Mr Harper said, vowing to push on with tougher security laws.

'They need to be much strengthened, and I assure you, Mr Speaker, that work which is already under way will be expedited.'

Harper was in parliament when the attack began, addressing members of his party on the increased terror threat to Canada. 

In a televised address to the nation, he said: 'We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.

'This week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,' 

'We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and our institutions of governance are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.'

One source told the Globe and Mail that MPs had flanked the doors of their meeting room, preparing to attack the gunman with sharpened flagpoles.

'These guys were up there holding these spears ready to impale anyone who came in,' the source said.

Ottawa police said there were shootings at the War Memorial and at the Canadian Parliament 

Mr Harper was placed in a cupboard - described as little more than a 'cubbyhole' in the Centre Block after the gunfire rang out, the report said.

The Globe and Mail's source said many MPs had no idea the prime minister was still in the building. 

Foreign Minister John Baird said there were no substantiated claims yet that Zehaf-Bibeau was associated with Islamic State.

He said he was 'tremendously concerned about the number of Canadians who are radicalised and are fighting in Syria or Iraq, but we don't have any evidence to link the two at this stage'.

'Reports suggest that well in excess of 100 Canadians have gone to fight jihad in the Middle East and that's a huge concern.'

Mr Baird also said Zehaf-Bibeau could have done much more damage than he did.

'For several minutes it was complete horror, complete terror, we didn't know whether the door was going to be kicked in, whether there was one or a group of people.'
