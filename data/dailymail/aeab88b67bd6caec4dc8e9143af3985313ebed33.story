As more players explore the hidden gems of Grand Theft Auto V, a gaming site has uncovered parody Facebook and Twitter accounts while playing in storyline mode.

Lifeinvader is the game's version of Facebook and comes with the taglines: 'The reason the world never gets anything done any more' and 'Information isn't about imparting knowledge anymore. The 
Internet changed all that.'

There is also a Twitter parody called Bleeter, in which users send bleets, and is described in-game as 'Bleeter is the perfect storm of blogging,
social networking and text messaging. We're demolishing 100,000 years 
of complex linguistic development 140 characters at a time.'

The sign sits outside the headquarters of Lifeinvader - Grand Theft Auto V's in-game parody of Facebook. During an early mission, players explore the offices of the social network site

Reports claims that Grand Theft Auto V has already exceeded worldwide sales of £500 million ($800 million).

The game delivered the highest first day retail sales of any title sold by Take-Two Interactive Software, the parent company of the game's developer Rockstar.

Stores across the UK opened their doors at midnight on Tuesday for the special launch of the game, which reportedly cost around £170 million ($275 million) to make and market - more than films such as Avatar.

During one mission, the player can explore the offices of Lifeinvader.

In another, a news report shows the site's CEO and staff discuss how the he 'stole the site' from his co-founders - in reference to the claims made by the Winkelvoss brothers against Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.

As an extension of this Easter Egg, discovered by gaming site Kotaku, Rockstar has also launched a real-life version of the site that lets players sign into using their Social Club details.

The Social Club is Rockstar's community site.

For people without a Social Club login, clicking the Lifeinvader icon in the top right-hand corner loads a series of example, spoof brand pages for armament companies, broadcasters, a drink called Sprunk, cigarettes and a barbers.

This Lifeinvader motto pokes fun at the privacy concerns raised by some Facebook users. In the game, the site is given the tagline: 'The reason the world never gets anything done any more'

One account, for Warstock Cache and Carry said: 'Whether you’re a private security company, paramilitary force, rebel militia, hot housewife, radical insurgent, unhinged lottery winner, over-zealous neighborhood watch group, or just a military hobbyist with a worrying amount of disposable income, we’ve got you covered.

Our online store is officially launching. Visit us anytime even from your iFruit phone at Warstock-Cache-And-Carry.com and shop for all your armored vehicle needs in the Los Santos area.

'We know you appreciate being prepared, and so do we.

So as a one-time special deal for all those who STALK our page here at LifeInvader, we’re happy to offer a 10% discount for your first purchase of any armored vehicle at our online store when it launches this September.

'STALK now and stay tuned to our page to see some of the inventory we’ll have on offer.'

Stalking is the equivalent to Facebook's Like button and the iFruit reference pokes fun at Apple's iPhone.

During one in-game shot, white boards in the offices of Lifeinvader claim: 'Remember! We aren't ripping them off if they don't read the T&C' with word privacy crossed out.

The blue and green Bleeter site, that mimics the colour-scheme of Twitter, has the tagline: 'Life Suddenly Got Quick' with a sheep icon.

It is also described in-game as: 'Information isn't about imparting knowledge anymore. The Internet changed all that.

'Welcome to world of self aggrandizing shorthand. Keep strangers and people you hated in high school up to speed with every mundane detail of your life 24/7.

'Welcome the the delusion of having an interesting life and friends.'
