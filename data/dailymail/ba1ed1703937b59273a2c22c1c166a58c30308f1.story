When Stuart Lancaster had lunch with Bath head coach Mike Ford at a village pub outside Bradford-on-Avon earlier this month, Sam Burgess’s cross-code move was high on their mutual agenda.

By the time they went their separate ways, the two men had a mutual vision too – of club and country being best served by the recruit from rugby league wearing No 12 on his back. In time, Bath may utilise Burgess as a back-row force of nature, but initially at least, he will serve a midfield apprenticeship, which suits England just fine.

For now, the 25-year-old is focused on propelling his Australian club, South Sydney Rabbitohs, to the NRL title as a fitting sign-off before coming home and preparing for a crash course in the 15-man game, starting in October. Soon enough though, Bath expect him to be wreaking havoc at centre and Lancaster will monitor his progress in the hope that it leads him all the way into next year’s World Cup squad.

Highly-rated: Big things are expected of Sam Burgess when he makes the switch from rugby league to union

International: Burgess dives for the line representing England's rugby league team 

Ford revealed that he and the England head coach held face-to-face talks about Burgess and that it was very much a meeting of like minds: ‘I went for lunch with Stuart and we discussed it,’ said the long-time defence coach of the national team. 

‘We’ve both got the same view really, in terms of where he is best off starting.

‘I think if he’s got any chance of playing for England at the World Cup, it is going to be at inside centre. I can understand that if he impresses at 12 for us; that is probably where England will look to put him. I spoke to Stuart about that.

‘I get a sense that they (England) are looking at him for his leadership qualities as well. When the opposition have a purple patch, who are the guys you turn to? He is certainly one guy who would just say, “Give me the ball and I’ll get us back on track now”.

‘Every coach is looking for a player like that. We talked about the way Stuart wants to play the game and clearly the 12 is a massive player in what you can and can’t do. He’s pretty clear, Stuart, in what he wants. His view on Sam is, “Let’s see how he goes at Bath” and if he plays really, really well they will probably look at him for their wider World Cup squad.’

Future planning: Stuart Lancaster, England head coach, has big plans for powerful Burgess 

New boy: Bath coach Mike Ford will welcome Burgess to the fold in October 

Despite the impression that Bath’s positional deployment of Burgess will suit the national cause, Ford was adamant that no pressure was applied – once the RFU had abandoned their intention to assist with the transfer fee. ‘He is our player,’ he said. ‘Bruce (Craig, Bath’s owner) paid for him. It was a normal transaction and we decide on how he is developed.’

As a former league international himself, Ford believes that Burgess will be in the right place for his education in union. He travelled to Australia to visit the player and his family back in June, armed with a hefty manual on the ‘Bath way’ and words of reassurance for a worried mother.

‘I spent eight days in Sydney,’ he said. ‘I saw him for three or four days. I met his family. He has a ritual, every night before a game his brothers come over for spaghetti bolognese – I got invited to that. I spoke to his mum about his move; she is from Dewsbury, her little boy is going back to England and she is upset. I said, “Look, I’ve got three boys, there’s one in Bath, one in Sale, one in London. You are quite lucky that all your boys are playing for the same team”.’

League connection: New Bath team-mate Kyle Eastmond knows Burgess from his time in rugby league 

Double act: George Ford and Burgess could link up for Bath and England  

Burgess has watched the Sydney-based Waratahs – the Super 15 champions – in training and spent time with their coach, Michael Cheika. He was also in the stands to watch Australia draw with the All Blacks earlier this month. He is gradually trying to adopt a rugby union mind-set, without detracting from the pressing task of finishing his league career on a glorious high.

There is a buzz of anticipation at Bath about the high-profile arrival from the rival code. Some of the playing are ‘stalking him on Twitter’. Kyle Eastmond, who has already made the switch from league at St Helens to Bath and into the England team, is looking forward to renewing an old acquaintance, even though he and Burgess may be competing for the same starting place.

‘I’ve known Sam since I was 12,’ he said. ‘I’ve played with him all the way through; for Lancashire against Yorkshire, training camps, representative, national. I know what he’s like. He’ll come in here, work hard, be patient, learn the game.

‘He’s a great player and a friend of mine, so I’m looking forward to him getting here. In camps with him, Sam was always a stand-out player, he loves the contact, is always flying around making tackles and he has gone on to have a great career. I hope he’s going to have a great career in union.

‘It’s unbelievable, to think all those years ago all we thought of was playing rugby league and here we both will be at Bath. It’s going to be awesome and nice to have someone with you that you’ve been playing with since you were a young lad.’

There is history between Burgess and George Ford too. Mike’s son; the Bath and England fly half, recalled an amusing first meeting between them, saying: ‘He was at Bradford Bulls, I was about 15, 16 and I was making the decision whether to go to Bradford or Leicester. He came to the house with Steve McNamara (Bradford coach at the time) and basically said, “Sign for Bradford, it’s going places, we’ve got a young team…”. Six months later he signed for South Sydney – and I went to Leicester!’

Now, several years on, belatedly the pair will be joining forces, in what could emerge as a potent 10-12 combination for Bath. In time, they could form an effective double-act for England too.
