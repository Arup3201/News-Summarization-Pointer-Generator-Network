He previously said on visiting Pakistan: 'I will be going to Pakistan between Christmas and New Year.

'Talking about this stuff could be threatening for me, but I just want to speak the truth and tell people what is happening is wrong.

'I think it's more important now than ever to go over there. I think it will send a statement to a lot of people that Amir Khan is going there to make a difference.

'I want it to be a better country. It's just a shame - I cannot believe how sick some people are.'
