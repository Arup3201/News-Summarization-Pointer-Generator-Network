Parents have been warned about the dangers of buying budget car seats online after another illegal batch was spotted on sale that could be fatal in a crash at just 30mph.

Shocking slow-speed footage shows the unbranded Chinese-made seat disintegrating on impact and forcing the child's head  through the front of the car - causing potentially fatal injuries.

The blue and black child seat was tested by safety experts Britax, who revealed that it ripped apart at a 30mph impact - well below EU guidelines.

They appear to be made of weak nylon straps and sub-standard stitching and were priced around £18 - less than half the cost of the cheapest standard toddler car seat.

West Sussex County Council has removed more than 100 vendors from selling the cheap seats after an initial complaint about a Surrey sale.

But other foreign websites are still flouting UK law and selling the seats online to British customers, prompting the council to alert the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

Peter Aston, West Sussex County Council's Trading Standards Manager, said: 'With a truly global market these days, foreign companies with no EU presence are increasingly advertising in the UK and shipping direct to customers.

Specialist testing revealed the car seats, meant to be designed for toddlers, were woefully unsafe

'Such companies are incredibly difficult to regulate as they are not subject to UK law.

'We are aware of similar car seats that have been tested and this has shown that they provide totally inadequate protection and I have no doubt that in a car accident there is a strong possibility that any child in one would be killed.'

In order to be sold in the UK car seats must pass two crash tests, one front-on at 30mph, and another from the rear at 20mph.

Crash dummies are strapped into the seats and sensors are used to measure damage, which must be below certain levels.

Passing such tests will allow a seat to go on sale in this country, but road safety groups will usually carry out additional tests before giving each seat a rating.

Jackie Boyle, Community Fire & Road Safety Officer for West Sussex Fire & Rescue Service, said: 'As a fire service, sadly, we see the aftermath of road traffic collisions on a regular basis.

'Even in a minor collision if a child is not properly restrained in a correctly fitted car seat, the consequences can be devastating.

'These seats are downright dangerous. There is no such thing as a bargain when it comes to buying a car seat so please don't put your child's life at risk.

'Go to a reputable retailer and look for a label showing a capital 'E' in a circle. That means its EU safety approved.'

Shoppers were warned earlier this week after it emerged that one model was available to buy through Amazon despite failing every single UK safety test.

The Paibi Baby Bear car seat was supplied directly from China but could be bought by UK customers via Amazon, and can be shipped over to this country via several other sites.
