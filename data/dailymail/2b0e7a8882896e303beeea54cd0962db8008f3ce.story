Brendan Rodgers should axe Mario Balotelli for Liverpool's Champions League clash against Real Madrid and play Raheem Sterling up front instead, according to Jamie Carragher. 

Carragher reckons the misfiring Italian should be dropped for Wednesday night's game because he 'doesn't run around enough' and Liverpool can't afford 'any passengers'. 

The former Liverpool defender says Balotelli should be replaced by Philippe Coutinho - which would allow Sterling to play up top.

Jamie Carragher would make the controversial decision to leave out Balotelli

He said: 'I would bring [Philippe] Coutinho in for Balotelli and play Raheem Sterling at centre forward.

'They can't have any passengers. He [Balotelli] doesn't run around enough and against Real Madrid you've got to get that crowd going.

'There’s got to be an energy about Liverpool that we haven’t seen; we’ve seen it once this season at Spurs. 

'It’s going on too long now and we can’t keep waiting. It’s a huge game and Liverpool have to get something from it.

'I would put Raheem Sterling in there because he can run in behind and Liverpool may have to counter-attack a lot of the game. Madrid may have a lot of the ball.

'Sterling can also press from the front. He doesn’t have to play right up front and he can come back and help the midfield.'

Liverpool go into the game on the back of Sunday's thrilling 3-2 win at QPR that saw them snatch the points at the death. 

Liverpool's leaky defence have their work cut out trying to keep Cristiano Ronaldo quiet

Carragher reckons there were signs that their flowing counter-attacking football from last season was on its way back.

But the former centre back admits their defence is a concern as they prepare to take on Cristiano Ronaldo and Co.

He added: 'In 11 games, they've conceded six goals from set pieces. It must be as bad as anyone in the league. I think Crystal Palace have conceded one more.

'Every time they concede a set piece they look like conceding a goal.'
