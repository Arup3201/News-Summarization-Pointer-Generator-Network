The police officers who responded to the 911 from a woman in Colorado, who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out have praised the woman's strength and bravery in the most trying of circumstances.

Michelle Wilkins, 26, was seven months pregnant when she responded to a Craigslist posting for maternity clothes in Longmont, on Wednesday, only to be stabbed in the stomach by the stranger who posted the ad, with her baby forcibly removed from her womb.

Local law enforcement officers Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski were first on the scene and describe finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock.

'I started yelling and Michelle yelled back, very faintly, and it was muffled — "Help me! Help me!"' Sawyer told KTLA.

He describes finding her covered from head to toe in blood.

'So I put some gloves on and held her hand and went through where her injuries were … trying to figure out exactly what we had,' he said.

Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, 'She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly.'

But Sawyer's colleague Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who 'saved her own life.'

'She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,' he said.

The situation was so bad that he had to leave the room for a moment to compose himself.

Attacked: Michelle Wilkins had her first baby 'expertly cut from womb by Dynel Catrece Lane' after going to her house to answer Craigslist ad. Wilkins was so shocked when she arrived at Longmont United Hospital, Colorado, that she still thought she was pregnant, sources say

Michelle Wilkins' parents have spoken at-length for the first time about the unspeakable attack on their daughter, saying she is 'guardedly optimistic' but 'scarred beyond imagination'. 

The statement released from Watkins' family, via Longmont police, on Friday revealed the mom-to-be was expecting a daughter.

'Her attacker beat, cut, and strangled her, and according to initial reports, then removed her unborn daughter with an ordinary kitchen knife, leaving Michelle for dead,' the parents said in the statement.

'We cannot begin to fathom the depths of depravity and evil which drove her attacker, and trust that between law enforcement and our legal system; they will make sure justice is carried out. 

'One life was ended and another scarred beyond imagination in this senseless act, with scores of others negatively affected.' 

The suspect, Dynel Lane, 34, was arrested presenting the abducted child as her own in hospital, and is facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, assault and child abuse.

She been remanded in Boulder County Jail on $2 million bail.

On Friday, a member of staff at Longmont United Hospital today told Daily Mail Online how Wilkins did not realize she had lost her baby to a maniac and still believed she was carrying her child.

Abby Johnson, 18, an intern at the hospital said the horrified woman, who had blood pouring from her stomach, pleaded for help and was concerned about the safety of the baby which had been due this Spring.

Johnson, speaking through her friend Gary Brennan, said Michelle was in 'a terrible state with her guts hanging out. She had been bleeding really badly.' 

Her cousin told ABC11 that the baby was her first and would have been her parents' first grandchild.  

Wilkins' partner Dan - the couple are not married and his surname is not known - is at her bedside.

'Michelle's always been a person who is kind hearted, a free spirit, has a love for all mankind, and I can't imagine what she's going through at this time,' Tony Wilkins, her cousin,  told ABC11.com.

'It's almost like a horror movie. Who would think that something like this would actually occur in real life.'

The baby died after  Lane took it to the hospital and told a staffer she had had a miscarriage, according to authorities.

Johnson said Lane had arrived at the hospital around 20 minutes earlier with the baby's body, crying and saying: 'It's all my fault. I am so sorry.'

The suspect told staff she had been pregnant, but had miscarried her child and repeatedly apologized to staff.

Abby said the baby was 'completely clean and washed and still had the umbilical chord attached, but the woman was covered in blood'.

She added: 'I was on my own and told her I could not be responsible for taking care of her and went to get help.

'She was covered in blood and kept saying she had miscarried.'

The alleged attacker and victim did not meet a second time at the hospital as they were ferried to separate rooms.

Police are investigating whether Lane knocked Wilkins her unconscious and then removed the fetus by cutting open her abdomen.

Wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday to buy baby clothes which had been advertised. She was also stabbed in the neck with a broken glass before being cut open.

In Longmont this week, protesters took to the streets of the city, which has a population of 90,000, to pressure police into charging the suspect with murder. 

Court: Dynel Lane is seen exiting the courtroom area after her first appearance on Thursday, March 19, 2015, at the Boulder County Jail. Lane, accused of cutting open the belly of a pregnant woman and removing her unborn baby from her womb, had told her family she was expecting a baby boy

The demonstrator's held placards with messages such as 'Murder is murder' and 'Justice for Michelle'.

Among then were several pregnant women who got together to join the demonstration through social media.

Katelyn Dunn, 26, said: 'We feel so sorry for Michelle. She had carried her child for seven months and must have been so excited about the future as a mother.

'It is a very special thing to have a child and this is such an appalling thing to happen. We feel so much for her and want the attacker to be accused of murder and nothing less.'

Murder charges against Lane now depend on whether the child was alive outside of the 26-year-old expectant mother's womb, the district attorney's office said on Thursday. 

Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett said: 'The issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue.

Protests: Naomi Garcia, 11, left to right, her grandmother Eileen Egger, and Jennifer Ansell demand murder charges be brought against Lane at an impromptu protest in Longmont last Wednesday

'Under Colorado law, essentially, there's no way murder charges can be brought if it's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time.

'I don't know the answer yet as to whether that can be established, what our facts are here.' 

Lane allegedly lured Wilkins to her Longmont home on Wednesday using the Craigslist ad.

Wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday. A knife with a 3-inch blade was found at the scene, according to CNN. 

Lane, who has two teenage daughters, made a brief appearance in court Thursday.

A police report on Thursday read: 'The person who did the incision would have to have researched the subject of Cesarean Births to achieve the level of accuracy.'

State records show Lane holds an expired nurse's aide license.

The suspect's husband, David Ridley, told police he returned home to take his wife to a scheduled prenatal checkup, however she informed him she had miscarried and that the baby was in the bathtub.

Treatment: Both women were taken to Longmont United Hospital. The victim remains critical but stable

Mr Ridley, who is not considered a suspect, said he found the baby in the tub, turned it over and rubbed its back.

He told police he heard the child take a 'gasping breath'.

Mr Ridley grabbed the baby and his wife and rushed both of them to hospital. 

Lane carried the infant's dead body into the hospital wrapped in a towel and told staff that she had suffered a miscarriage. Despite being covered in blood, she refused to be examined by staff and later admitted to police she had cut open another woman's womb. 

Meanwhile, Wilkins managed to call 911 while she lay bleeding heavily in the basement of the cul-de-sac home.

During the desperate six-minute call, she faintly told the dispatcher: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.'

The woman was able to give the dispatcher the address, adding that she was in the basement and had locked the door.

She had multiple wounds, Wilkins said, and the attacker broke a glass and stabbed her in the neck as she was trying to leave.
