Dozens of underperforming schools could be removed from council control and handed to ‘super-heads’ in the wake of alleged Islamist takeover plots.

Michael Gove is considering stripping Birmingham’s Labour-run council of the power to run many of its schools.

The Education Secretary’s intervention comes amid claims radical Muslims tried to overthrow heads and governors and push through strict Islamic practices.

Michael Gove is considering stripping the Labour-run council of its power to control Birmingham's schools

But the plan to remove failing schools from council control is said to extend beyond so-called Trojan Horse schools to include those that fared poorly in Ofsted inspections.

Mr Gove is understood to fear that Birmingham, England’s second largest city, has failed to provide decent education at dozens of schools.

About 15 successful head teachers are expected to be invited to take over at the failing schools.

Those which already operate outside council control could also be reassigned to outstanding heads.

There are suggestions that responsibility for some or all of Birmingham’s education and children’s services could be given to an independent trust.

The approach has been used previously in areas of poor performance – such as Hackney in London.

Birmingham heads were told at a recent council meeting to expect a ‘bloody firestorm’ after investigations into the Trojan Horse allegations are published.

Ofsted had to abandon an inspection of a private primary school after pupils as young as nine were questioned about their attitudes to homosexuality.

Parents were concerned after children told them inspectors had spoken privately to a group of nine and ten-year-olds at the Muslim school, asking them: ‘What does the word gay mean?’ and ‘Is it used in a bad way at school?’It is claimed the children were also asked about terrorism and whether it was discussed.

Ofsted was forced to cut short its visit to Olive Tree Primary School in Luton after parents threatened to  withdraw their children.

Ghulam Shah, 40, said his ten-year-old son came home complaining about being asked ‘scary and weird questions’. He said the inspector told his son not to be offended, adding: ‘It’s just a part of the law we have to ask you.’

Ofsted apologised for upsetting parents, but a spokesman said: ‘As part of any school inspection, inspectors will ask pupils about the effectiveness of the school’s actions to prevent and tackle discriminatory and derogatory language – including homophobic language.’

Mark Rogers, Birmingham’s chief executive, told his audience to prepare for ‘significant structural changes’ in the education department, leaked recordings reveal.

Four investigations are being conducted into claims that orchestrated attempts were made to impose a hardline Islamic agenda on Birmingham state schools.

These include a probe by Ofsted, which has carried out snap inspections at 21 schools and is preparing individual reports and an overview, due in early June.

Leaks claim several of the schools will be put in special measures.

Any schools removed from council control would be converted into academies run by outside trusts involving experienced heads.

Liam Nolan, chief executive of Perry Beeches Trust, which oversees three schools in the city, is one of those expected to be approached for the role.

He told the Sunday Times ministers had asked outstanding heads ‘to take responsibility for certain schools’ and that the move highlighted the council’s failure to take ‘responsibility for the education of young people’.

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw last year described Birmingham’s children’s services as a ‘national disgrace’ and suggested the authority may need to be broken up.

The authenticity of the letter which originally described ‘Operation Trojan Horse’ is open to question but the National Association of Head Teachers reported that its own casework had shown ‘concerted efforts’ to change the character of at least six schools.

A Birmingham City Council spokesman said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to comment before Ofsted publishes its report.
