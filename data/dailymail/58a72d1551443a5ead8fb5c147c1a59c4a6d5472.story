A powerful horse tranquilliser that doubles as a dangerous and illegal party drug was so successful as a treatment for depression that it helped a 32-year-old woman leave the house by herself of the first time in over a decade.

The woman, who chose to remain anonymous, was part of a controversial study by the Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust in which 28 severely depressed patients were regularly injected with ketamine - a powerful and hallucinogenic party drug that’s usually snorted by its users - in an effort to improve their lives.

Patients injected with the veterinary tranquilliser said the treatments left them feeling ‘peculiar’, saying the injections made ‘things sound and look different’ and left them with ‘a distorted sense of time’.

A controversial UK study has found regular injections of the party drug may help treat severe depression

The mother of one patient said the injections left her daughter - who'd suffered from crippling depression for most of her adult life, leaving her unable to leave the house by herself - feeling 'chatty' and able to 'concentrate better'.

'After she’s had the treatment, she’s already feeling better before we leave the hospital,' she told the BBC's Radio 4.

'It works that quickly, and she’s sort of got a lot more confidence in herself when she’s had the treatment.'

Her mum said one treatment was so successful that her daughter went for a walk outside the house by herself for the first time in over a decade.

'She’s chatty and she’ll talk to people. She’s not as withdrawn as she’d normally be,' she said.

'She can concentrate better, and after one lot of the treatment she even 
went out for a walk on her own the day after - which she’s not done...in the last 10 years.'

Ketamine: A powerful horse tranquilliser once used to anaesthetise humans but was largely abandoned due the hallucinations it causes. The illegal party drug is now being used as a treatment for depression.

Ecstasy: The drug, which produces hallucinations and euphoric feelings, is already being trialled as a treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder but could also be used by cancer patients.

Magic Mushrooms: These naturally occurring hallucinogens could be used in psychotherapy to treat obsessive compulsive disorders or depression.

Cocaine: The leaves of the plant that form the base for the party drug has long been used in its raw form as a topical anaesthetic and numbing agent for injuries or operations among South American tribes.

The NHS-funded study's head 
researcher, Rupert McShane, said patients were given either three or six ketamine injection over three weeks.

Of the study’s 28 
participants, 29 per cent reported a positive benefit that lasted between 
four and seven days, while 15 per cent reported feeling better for at 
least a month. He said that for some patients, the effects lasted for up to nine months.

Mr McShane said the challenge now is to find a way to regulate and extend the effects of the drug.

‘That’s the thing that will be interesting in the future, how could we extend the benefit,’ he said.

‘During
 the 40 minute infusion of people having a low dose of this they feel 
pretty peculiar and things sound and look different and they have a 
distorted sense of time.

‘Occasionally
 people feel anxious during the infusion, and we also had one person who
 had a nasty faint as well. But those kinds of side effects stop pretty 
much as soon as the infusion stops.

‘(The
 effects) are very variable, some people it may only be six hours but 
for others – we had one patient who seemed to get a benefit that lasted 
nine months. In the majority though it’s about two weeks.

'It looks as if (the drug) is safe enough when used in a controlled setting.'

Research into ketamine as a treatment
 for depression was launched in America over a decade ago, after doctors
 found that the party drug blocked receptors in the same part of the 
brain thought to be responsible for depression.

The results have proven so successful that private clinics - like New York's Ketamine Infusions, which provides patients TV and Wi-Fi while undergoing the hour-long procedure - charge US$525 (£315) per injection.

The company's website warns patients might experience 'minor visual hallucinations' while undergoing the treatment.
