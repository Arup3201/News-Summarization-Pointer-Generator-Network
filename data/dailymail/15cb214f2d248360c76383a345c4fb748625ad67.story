A former beauty queen who was barred from entering Miss England because she was married has died in a car crash.

Bonnie Hiller, 27, was killed when the grey Mercedes convertible she was driving went out of control and collided with a bridge under the A12 bypass in Kelvedon, Essex.

She was the only person in the car and no other vehicles were involved in the incident which unfolded at about 6.30pm on Saturday.

Wedding: Mrs Hillier competed in the
 Miss England competition, but had to step aside because she was a Mrs

Mrs Hiller, from Tiptree, Essex, was pursuing a modelling career having been crowned as Miss Colchester and Miss East Anglia in 2009.

She should have gone on to compete in the Miss England competition, but had to step aside because she was a Mrs, having got married.

The former Thurstable pupil was working with boutiques across Essex.

Her father Paul said: 'She was a wonderful girl and a wonderful daughter who was very close to her mum and a joy to be with.

'She was a beautiful, glamorous girl with a heart of gold. I don’t think she had an enemy in the world - she was her dad’s Tinkerbell.

Tributes: Flowers have been laid at the scene of the crash under the A12 bypass in Kelvedon

Promising future: Hiller, who was driving a grey Mercedes convertible when it collided with a bridge support, was pursuing a career in modelling after being crowned Miss Colchester in 2009

'She was a model and an actress but her ambition was to start a family. 

Mrs Hiller, who was the youngest of three sisters, was part of a close knit family and grew up in Tiptree, and was a successful show jumper when she was younger.

She enjoyed success in the Miss Colchester and Miss East Anglia competitions five years ago - and credited her father with the giving her the confidence to enter.

He said: 'The last thing me and her mum have to do is to give her a glamorous send off as she would have wanted.'

The family are planning a big send off for Mrs Hiller and want as many friends and acquaintances to attend as possible.

Mr Hiller thanked his daughter's agent and friend, Pam Boon, for all her help.

She said: 'She was much more than a beauty queen, much more than a model, she just had a heart of gold.

'She was lovely, beautiful, kind and gentle. She was very funny and kind, I just can’t fault her.'
