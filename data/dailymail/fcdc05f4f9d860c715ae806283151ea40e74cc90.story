More than $50 billion (£42 billion) has been sliced off tech giant Apple's market value as its share price plummeted.

The share price fell by 12 per cent, prompted by poor iPhone sales over Christmas and fears the huge success of the iPad mini is impacting on sales of the firm's range of full sized iPads and Mac computers.

The computer giant’s latest figures reveal a 21.2 percent drop in Mac sales from the same time last year.

Apple's quarterly revenue by product: Experts believe consumers may be buying iPads instead of more expensive Mac computers from Apple, leading to a 21.2 percent drop in Mac sales this quarter

It is believed consumers are so enamoured by the tablet they are buying it instead of a more expensive Mac computer.

Some reports even claim the smaller, cheaper iPad Mini is having a similar effect on sales of the full sized iPad.

Apple sold 22.9 million iPads up from 15.4 million the same quarter last year - and admits it has struggled to meet demand for the latest iPad mini.

During the earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted a big chunk of the decrease was due to the iMac as consumers increasingly move to laptops and tablets - and sales for that product line alone shrank by some 700,000 units.

However, the firm tried to put a positive spin on the move.

‘I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us,’ said Mr Cook.

'On the iPad we have the mother of all opportunities here — the Windows market is much, much larger than the Mac market.’

He also believes that buying iPads can lead to buying computers.

‘When someone buys their first Apple product," he said, 'they end up buying another one.'

The figures mark the first time in several years the firms Mac computers have failed to out-grow the PC industry as a whole.

Following the results, eighteen brokerages cut their price targets on the world's biggest technology company's stock, as its shares slumped to $451 in value at the opening of the Nasdaq.

Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies, who have previously raised concerns about Apple cutting orders to suppliers, described the slowdown in iPhone sales as 'real and material'.

He said: 'We think Apple is losing the screen-size wars.' The statement was a reference to a shift in demand from the iPhone's smaller screens to five-inch screens being sold by rivals.

Jefferies & Co cut its share price target to $500, a cut of $300.

Among those to share the skepticism was Deutsche Bank, who trimmed its price target to $575 from $800.

Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with IDC, said the firm had to release a lower cost iPhone.

'Despite the excellent results last quarter, it is now clear that Apple will not be able to continue posting consistent remarkable iPhone results in the long term without a portfolio strategy change,' he said.

'It is now time for Apple to increase the number of devices and to address different market segments.'

Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'There’s no doubt the iPhone and iPad have been revolutionary devices, but Apple’s growing reliance on iteration over innovation has shaken the faith of investors looking at the long term.

'The potential for increased volume by targeting that price-savvy shopper with an all-new iPhone – rather than having them settle for last year’s finest – could be the tactical strike that keeps Apple one step ahead.

'We should never underestimate Apple's ability to surprise.'

Apple shares fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading Wednesday, following the announcement of their poor sales, despite record profits.

The company shipped 47.8 million of the flagship product, less than the 50 million that Wall Street analysts had predicted for the period ending December 29, sending the stock down.

Sales of the iPad came in at 22.9 million in the fiscal first quarter, about in line with forecasts.

Apple said that its fiscal first quarter revenue rose to $54.5 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $54.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.

This is the slowest growth rate for the company since at least 2009.

Drop: Shares of Apple fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trades following the latest earnings report on Wednesday, after closing up 1.8 per cent during the regular session

Shares in Apple fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trades following the earnings report, after closing up 1.8 per cent at $514.01 during the regular session.

For the fiscal first quarter, the company posted net income of $13.07 billion, or $13.81 a diluted share, compared to $13.06 billion, or $13.87 a share, a year earlier.

Sources this month have pointed to production cutbacks at Apple's component suppliers as a sign that demand may be waning for the iPhone, which accounts for half of the company's sales, and the iPad.

The disappointing numbers come after Apple undershot revenue targets in the previous two quarters. The results will prompt more questions on what Apple has in its product pipeline, and what it can do to attract new sales and maintain growth.

Apple's share price fell by 12 per cent, prompted by poor iPhone sales over Christmas, as concerned investors speculated as to whether the company was losing its dominant position in the smartphone market

The technology giant's shares have dropped around 30 per cent since September, erasing about $190 billion in market value amid concerns that the world is falling out of love with iPhones and iPads.

It comes after less than stellar sales of its iPhone 5, and as the company faces rising production costs, competition from rival Samsung, and slowing growth in smartphones.

Wednesday's earnings report was expected to show that first-quarter net income slipped two per cent to $12.8 billion, or $13.48 a share, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

The actual earnings, however, were better than expected. Such a drop would have been the first fall in earnings since 2003.

Analysts projected sales would rise 18 per cent to $54.8 billion. But they fell short at just $54.5 billion - which equates to the slowest growth for the company since at least 2009.

Some have attributed the decline to the market becoming saturated with other smartphones, meaning growth for Apple is slowing. 

Rival Samsung offers more than 80 touchscreen smartphones and many are opting for alternatives to the newest - and expensive -  iPhone 5, which starts at around $199 with a two-year contract.

Problems are believed to have arisen when the iPhone 5 made its debut.

Critics of the new, larger screened model, complained it was riddled with errors its predecessor did not have.

One of its most useful features, Google maps, was replaced by an in-house version which contained glaring errors and missed entire areas.

The long-awaited model also 'scratched too easily' according to diehard Apple fans, and many became disenchanted with the company's until now unrivaled magic.
