One million British children classed as healthy by the Government's official statistics are dangerously unfit, according to shocking new research.

Academics warn that an epidemic of inactivity means many slim-looking children have 'hidden' fat which puts them at risk of an  early death from type 2 diabetes  or heart disease.

They warn that a national schools strategy to monitor children's health is failing to identify many of those at risk because it does not officially class them as overweight.

An epidemic of inactivity means many slim-looking children have 'hidden' fat which puts them at risk

It uses a measurement known as body mass index (BMI), which estimates the number of overweight or obese school-age children at about three million - nearly 30 per cent of all five- to 18-year-olds.

But the latest research, using a more accurate method to measure actual body fat, indicates one million more children are carrying too much fat around their internal organs.

It provides mounting evidence that Britain is facing a childhood obesity crisis - and suggests the Olympic legacy of 2012 is failing to create healthier and more active young people. The scientists have described a generation of 'Tofi' kids - who are 'Thin on the Outside,  Fat on the Inside'.

They say as many as one in seven children recorded by schools as having a healthy BMI are at risk of developing life-limiting diseases.

Last night, after being confronted with the research, Public Health Minister Jane Ellison admitted BMI 'isn't a perfect measure'.

But despite the evidence, officials say there are no plans to change  the system.

Child obesity expert Professor David McCarthy, of London Metropolitan University, who led the research, said the number of unfit youngsters had been 'clearly underestimated'.

He added: 'There's a raft of children who have been overlooked because they have a “healthy” BMI. This matters because the more fat you have, compared to muscle, the more likely you are to develop type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease in later life. If they maintain that body composition into adulthood, or it gets worse, they are going to be at high risk of these diseases.'

The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), introduced in 2006, records children's height and weight at ages four to five, and again when they are ten and 11. These measurements produce a BMI for each child, which indicates whether they are within a healthy range or not. However, BMI is known to be poor at distinguishing between overweight children and those who are naturally muscular.

As a result of the programme, parents have received official letters warning them that their sporty, active children are overweight.

In the unpublished study of more than 1,000 children, Prof McCarthy used a Tanita 'bio-electrical impedance' machine that passes a low electrical current through the body to determine how much weight is  fat and how much is muscle.

The 
research found 15 per cent of those classed as having a healthy BMI 
carried high levels of fat, but low levels of muscle. One eight-year-old
 boy recorded a healthy BMI of 17.7 but was found to have 23 per cent 
body fat and low muscle mass.

Another
 boy, aged nine, had a healthy BMI of 19 but carried more than 28 per 
cent body fat, making him technically obese - despite not appearing 
overweight. Meanwhile, the study found one in ten children labelled 
overweight using BMI were healthy - equivalent to 300,000 children 
nationwide.

Prof 
McCarthy said: 'Many children find playing on the computer more 
enjoyable than hopscotch or tag, as they did 40 years ago. I think we 
have underestimated the importance of installing good physical activity 
habits early in life.'

Tam
 Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'The NCMP is not producing a 
true and accurate picture of obesity in this country. We need to see 
inside children with sophisticated scientific equipment to find hidden 
fat - otherwise we are failing to address a growing problem.

'There should be a scanning unit visiting schools, and children should be measured annually. We're making decisions on how to combat obesity based on inadequate information.'

Child fitness expert Dr Gavin Sandercock, at Essex University, said: 'The least fit and healthy children in our studies are the ones  who are underweight, not the overweight ones.

BMI isn't related to health at all - it's a height-to-weight ratio - and because it's so insensitive it's not fit for purpose. I can't think of a worse way to measure children's health. It fails them.'

Childhood obesity is known to be a growing problem in the UK which has been blamed on poor diet and lack of exercise.

Once established, it is hard to treat - making early intervention more crucial. Overweight children are more likely to become obese adults and therefore have a higher risk of premature death, disability and long-term health problems. Most of the serious consequences will not develop until adulthood.

The NCMP is administered by Public Health England. Dr Ann Hoskins, director of children, young people and families, said: 'We have to look at the totality of evidence, which concludes the BMI Centile is the most suitable indicator of body fat and overall weight in childhood.'

Minister Jane Ellison said: 'We know BMI isn't a perfect measure but it is recognised internationally as the most reliable way to estimate body mass. It is recommended by the World Health Organisation.

'There is still much to do and we are clear that families need a balanced diet and regular exercise to be healthy.'
