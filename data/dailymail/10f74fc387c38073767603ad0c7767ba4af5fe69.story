Norway's stunning new passport design has just been unveiled and it has mastered the art of Scandinavian minimalism.

Minimalist chic: Norway has just unveiled its new passports, designed by Oslo design studio, Neue

The new designs were the winning entry to the National Police Directorate's competition

The passport will have a red cover, unless you are a diplomat, in which case, you will receive a blue version.

Immigrants will be issued a pale gray design.

The new designs were an entry in the National Police Directorate's competition to 'find a unique concept with excellent design qualities and a theme that is widely accepted.'

The hope was also that the new design would increase security of Norwegian passports, ID cards, and other travel documents. 

'Nature has always been an essential part of the Norwegian identity and tradition, as well as being a  key fundament to our welfare,' said the design team. 

'The landscape with its vast variation from the south to the north, is the starting point for the design concept.

'The basis for the winning entry is the concept of The Norwegian Landscape.'

The hope was also that the new design would increase security of Norwegian passports, ID cards, and other travel documents

Though the design will be slightly adjusted and tweaked on the basis of technical and safety considerations, the final result will be presented soon.

The jury, speaking of their decision to crown Neue Design Studio the winners, said: 'It illustrates the Norwegian identity and makes sure the passport will be viewed as a document of high value.'

'It will be relevant for many years to come and has clear user benefits.

'The design is attractive and stylish, the colours are subtle and the abstraction of the landscapes are exciting.

'The jury appreciates the simplicity of the solution.'
