The 'Polar Vortex' has returned to the home of Mount Rushmore, blanketing the region with several inches of snow and marking the earliest winter storm in more than 120 years for South Dakota's second-largest city.

The town of Custer, named after the Civil War general, received eight inches, while seven inches fell on the four presidential faces carved from the granite rock on Mount Rushmore. 

Nearby Rapid City got as much as two inches in its earliest snowfall since 1888. 

A vintage 1880 Train chugs through the snow-covered hills between Hill City and Keystone, South Dakota, on Thursday. For nearby Rapid City, it was the earliest snowfall since 1888. 

The previous record was just seven-tenths of an inch on September 13, 1970, according to the Argus Leader.

Other towns reporting snowfall include Hill City with 4.5 inches, while Sundance, Wyoming, the home of the Sundance Film Festival, has received four inches this week.

Forecasters told the paper that temperatures were set to plunge into the teens on Thursday night amid a hard freeze.

But a warm front moving in will raise temperatures to almost 70 by the end of the weekend.

That's cold comfort to those who fear the early start to the annual deep freeze foreshadows a miserable winter - particularly given autumn remains almost two weeks off.
