As a two-year-old, he donated his bone marrow to try and help save his older sister.

The selfless act gave her an extra five years of life, allowing her to live into her teens.

But today Dushyant Mehta is desperate for his own transplant, after doctors revealed he is suffering the same rare syndrome that claimed his sister Devaanshi's life at just 15.

His family are distraught, having been told there is no match for their son on any bone marrow registers across the world.

It is the 10-year-old's Indian heritage that makes it more difficult to locate a donor, after his family were found to be inappropriate matches.

Dushyant Mehta, left, 10, is desperate for a bone marrow transplant after he was diagnosed with the same rare syndrome that killed his big sister Devaanshi when she was 15

In October 2014, Dushyant, pictured with his sisters Jyotika, Devaanshi and Tejal, started to suffer a series of colds that he couldn't shake off, he became increasingly breathless and recognising the signs his mother Kalyani Mehta contacted the specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital that treated his sister

His mother, Kalyani Mehta, 47, from Harrow, is appealing for people to sign the register, in the hope it will help save her son's life. 

'We desperately need a donor for Dushyant and we now know there is not currently anyone on any of the world's registers who is a match for him.

'However, it is also really important to us to help other people who are looking for donors.

'The only thing we have is hope and more donors on the register mean more hope for all patients in need of a transplant.' 

Devaanshi was diagnosed with dyskeratosis congenita - a rare illness that causes bone marrow failure - when she was nine years old.

Dyskeratosis congenita is a disorder that affects many parts of the body.

The three main features are that the finger and toenails grow poorly, or are abnormally shaped, changes in skin colouring especially on the neck and chest and white patches inside the mouth.

Sufferers have an increased risk of developing several life-threatening conditions.

They are very susceptible to disorders that cause the bone marrow to fail, affecting the bone marrow's ability to produce new blood cells.

It can cause aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, which occurs when the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells.

Those diagnosed with the condition are also at an increased risk of leukaemia.

Initially doctors believed she was suffering severe aplastic anaemia - a condition where the bone marrow fails to make enough red blood cells for the body.

But doctors soon realised the diagnosis was wrong and discovered the much rarer dyskeratosis congenita illness was to blame. 

Her devastated family were told she would need a bone marrow transplant.

All three of her siblings - her two older sisters, and her younger brother - were tested and Dushyant was found to be a match.

He was only two at the time, but in April 2007, Dushyant donated bone marrow to his sister.

Despite the transplant, Devaanshi was left dependent on platelet and blood transfusions and she launched a campaign to encourage more people to become blood, organ, and bone marrow donors.

In 2010, Devaanshi's lungs collapsed and were left so badly damaged that she was told her illness was incurable.

Despite her failing health, she continued to organise fundraising events and to inspire Asian people to become donors. 

She died at Great Ormond Street Hospital five years after her transplant.

Dushyant donated his bone marrow to help extend his sister's life when he was just two years old

Dushyant now desperately needs a bone marrow transplant and with no matches available,  his family are urging people to sign the register in the hope it will save his life

Two years after the 15-year-old's death, in October 2014, Dushyant suffered a series of colds that he couldn't shake off.

He became increasingly breathless and recognising the signs, Mrs Mehta contacted the specialists at Great Ormond Street that had treated her daughter.

Tests confirmed the family's fears - Dushyant has the same rare illness that claimed his sister's life.

His mother was told he too would need a bone marrow transplant to give him the greatest chance of survival.

His doctors turned to the charity Anthony Nolan asking them to search the world's registers for a potential match.

But this search failed, prompting Dushyant's family to issue a desperate plea for more people to sign the register.

They have been warned it is more difficult to find a match because the 10-year-old is from Indian heritage and people from ethnic minority backgrounds are under represented on the registers. 

Ms Mehta urged more people from Asian backgrounds to sign up.

'Signing up is about saving someone's life,' she said. 'It is that important and it is particularly vital to encourage people from ethnic minority backgrounds to sign up.'

If you are aged 16 to 30 and in good health you can sign the Anthony Nolan register at their website here.
