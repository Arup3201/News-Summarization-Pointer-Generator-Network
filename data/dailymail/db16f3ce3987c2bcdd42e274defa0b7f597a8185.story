A breakthrough in the design of batteries could mean the days when your mobile phone spends half the time plugged into the wall are numbered.

A remarkable new prototype battery needs just 12 minutes to fully recharge, rather than the hours conventional cells need to replenish.

What's more, researchers at the University of Maryland say their new invention could bring about the long sought-for miniaturisation of energy storage components.

That's the breakthrough that might finally allow electric cars to give petrol-powered vehicles a run for their money.

The battery uses structures called nanopores to hold electrolyte to carry electrical charge between nanotube electrodes at either end.

Many millions of these nanopore cells can be crammed into one larger battery the size of a postage stamp.

Co-author Eleanor Gillette said: 'A nanopore is a tiny hole, 80,000 times smaller than a human hair, that's made in a sheet of ceramic material.'

Chanyuan Liu, lead author, added: 'We coat energy storage material at two ends of this nanopore, then after fuelling the electrolyte each single nanopore will become a battery and all of them are connected in parallel.'

Miss Liu, a Ph.D. student in materials science and engineering, says the battery, described in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, can be fully charged in 12 minutes and it can be recharged thousands of times.

'Fast charging is a very appealing quality,' she told The Times. At the moment, she said, her batteries have the potential to equal the capacity of mainstream batteries, but researchers are working on increasing their energy.

'But the best bit is how fast it can be,' she said.

In a statement announcing the nano battery, researchers say they have identified improvements to the design that could make their next batch of batteries ten times more powerful.

Such an advance could revolutionise electronics and electric-powered devices, finally making devices like electric cars a viable product. While a kilo of petrol stores about 13,000 watt hours of energy, a kilo of battery can only hold 500, making e-cars difficult to use over long distances.

Miss Liu's battery is at the moment just a small, very thin slice of ceramic sheet. But the Maryland team say the device should be scalable.

In a single postage stamp-sized area more than a billion nano-sized cells could be wired in parallel, they say.

The research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.
