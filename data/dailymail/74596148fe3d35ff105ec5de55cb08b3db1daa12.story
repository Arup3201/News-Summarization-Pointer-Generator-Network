Seattle's first and only legal marijuana store has run out of stock and been forced to shut up shop just three days after opening.

Cannabis City, south of downtown, expects to reopen on July 21, according to a voicemail message for incoming callers.

The shop is one of a few dozen across the state to receive a license to sell marijuana legally in Washington, where a state law legalizing the sell of recreational marijuana went into effect last week.

Now closed: James Lathrop, the owner of recreational marijuana store Cannabis City, pumps his fist in the air before opening the shop on the first day in which retail marijuana sales were legal in Seattle, Washington

The store sold 11 pounds of the drug between opening day on July 8 and the end of the day on Thursday, the shop’s owner told the Tacoma News Tribune.

'We knew it was coming,' said owner James Lathrop. 'We didn’t have any guaranteed additional deliveries.'

Twenty months after voters legalized recreational cannabis for adults over 21, Washington state's first few licensed pot shops opened for business last week.

The shops catered to hundreds of customers who were thrilled to be part of the historic moment. The state eventually plans to have more than 300 shops operating.

Washington is the second state to allow marijuana sales without a doctor's note. Voters in Colorado also legalized pot in 2012, and sales began there January 1.

Washington's Liquor Control Board began working right away to develop rules governing just about every aspect of the industry, from what fertilizers can be used to how extracts are produced.

Nearly 7,000 people applied to grow, process or sell pot in Washington, but fewer than 100 growers have been approved

But the board has been overwhelmed: Nearly 7,000 people applied to grow, process or sell pot, and those licenses are being reviewed glacially by the board's 18 investigators.

Fewer than 100 growers have been approved, and only about a dozen were ready to harvest in time for the market's launch.

As for the stores, most first had to get lucky in state-run lotteries for 300-plus retail licenses being issued. Then they had to strike deals to buy product from the growers — in many cases at exorbitant prices.

Much of the marijuana being sold last Tuesday cost at least twice the $10 to $12 per gram offered by the state's unregulated medical dispensaries.

In Seattle, hundreds of people waited in the warm sunshine outside for Cannabis City to open at noon. Store owner James Lathrop declared it time to 'free the weed' and cut the ribbon — actually yellow police tape strung across the shop's door.
