·       Beauty, brawn and a blistering sound quality. Tritton’s latest, fully licenced, exclusive Xbox 360 headset is a joy to behold from the moment you begin unboxing. With an eye on Christmas, it aims to make itself the pinnacle for Xbox 360 owners.

First impressions of the Warhead 7.1 are very impressive with a lot of aesthetically pleasing features. There’s plenty of deep-black plastics and futuristic design with a sleek, triangular base and weighty headset; despite their size they sit very comfortably.

Sound investment: The Warhead may be pricy, but their build quality is second to none

In the past, headsets have been slated for their difficult setup, confusing cables or incompatibility with aspects of the console in use, yet the Warhead couldn’t be easier to set up.

The pyramid base station deals with the wireless connection and doubles up as a stand for the headset. All it needs is a power source and a cable that runs into the back of your Xbox 360.

Another perk is that the headset is compatible no matter which Xbox 360 you have, with adaptor cables supplied as standard to be used where required. You’re also provided with a spare battery, so one can charge whilst one is used – a praiseworthy inclusion.

The Warhead provides a glorious sound. Its clarity is a cut above with a plethora of deep bass and crystal clear treble.

The ‘over ear’ design, where the users ear sits completely inside the earcups, offers improved sound isolation and enhanced acoustics giving you complete immersion in the game you’re playing. 

Tritton have developed the Warhead utilising 5.8GHz wireless technology compared to the industry standard of 2.4GHz thus offering a superior performance and a quality sound equal to that of a wired headset.

Amongst its already impressive features and sound you are able to switch between 3 different settings; music, games and video, as well as the ability to toggle between muting and hearing the sound of your own voice whilst you play.

At £229.99 the Warhead is not cheap, though you get what you pay for, a sleek looking headset that pounds your eardrums with an abundance of rich tones.

For the keen Xbox 360 gamer – this is the must have headset and has set the bar for its competitors very high indeed.
