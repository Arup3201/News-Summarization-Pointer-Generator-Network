Altercation: Vice chairman of Deutsche Bank Brian Mulligan snarled at LAPD officers and struck martial arts poses while appearing 'out of it'

A Deutsche Bank director ran through traffic and struck martial arts poses during a bizarre altercation with Los Angeles police, authorities said.

Brian Mulligan, 53, appeared 'out of it'  after officers responded to 911 calls about a man trying to break into people's cars at a drive-thru in Highland Park.

Mulligan seemed to be 'under the influence based on his behavior', Lieutenant Andrew Neiman told MailOnline.

CBS Los Angeles, citing a police seen exclusively by the station, reported that officers were told by Mulligan he was high on marijuana and had ingested ‘White Lightning,’ another term for bath salts, and had not slept for four days.

The bank executive was spotted wandering in a confused state by passers-by on May 15, 2011 at around 10.40pm.

Due to his erratic behavior, officers called a senior officer to the scene, who carried out a drug evaluation.

There was no definitive evidence of a controlled substance that the LAPD test for, according to the police spokesman.

Mulligan told officers he was 'tired and exhausted' and asked to be escorted to his car so he could collect belongings to go to the local Highland Park Motel.

When they reached the vehicle, there was a large amount of money in the car, causing officers to call for back-up as is protocol. Mulligan was then left at the motel by officers without further incident.

Later that night at around 1am, the same officers who dropped Mulligan off at the motel responded to reports of a man trying to get into vehicles.

Lawsuit: The bank magnate is suiting the LAPD for $50million after the altercation left him with nasal fractures and other injuries

They saw Mulligan
in the street, running into oncoming traffic. Officers called him 
back on to the sidewalk, but rather than comply, Mulligan assumed a
‘combative stance’, striking martial arts poses.

At that point, officers were forced to subdue Mulligan adding that a ‘use of force then occurred' before he was arrested.

The businessman's injuries required him to be admitted to hospital for facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures.

Earlier this month Mulligan sued the LAPD for $50million, saying that during the 2011 encounter he was battered by the police.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the Deutsche Bank executive further alleged that the LAPD officers in question were holding him hostage at the motel where he was staying as a means to steal the $5,000 he had on his person at the time.

He said, she said: Police officers said they found Mulligan walking near this Los Angeles-area Jack-in-the-Box

Neither Mulligan nor Deutsche Bank immediately returned MailOnline’s requests for comment. 

Mulligan’s
lawyer Michael Flanagan told the Journal that the officers stopped him 
on a sidewalk in Los Angeles and discovered $5,000 cash in his car.

At that point, Mr Flanagan said that his client was driven to a hotel and told he would be killed if he attempted to leave.

When, after a few hours, Mulligan did try to leave, Mr Flanagan said that police found him and beat him mercilessly.

According to TMZ, Mulligan was booked for resisting arrest as well as interfering with law enforcement.

The gossip website also reported that the Deutsche exec suffered facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures.

Lt Andrew Neiman said the Force Investigation Division has opened an inquiry into Mulligan’s arrest, adding that it will likely be a year before it is completed. 

According to the Wall Street Journal, the magnate has been a financial backer in the entertainment industry, having worked at Fox Television and Universal Pictures.
