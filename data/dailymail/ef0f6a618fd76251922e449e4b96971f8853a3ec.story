Kelly Rutherford has spoken out about her ongoing custody battle in an emotional television interview, accusing her ex-husband of brainwashing their children.

The Gossip Girl actress broke down to tears on The View today as she discussed a ruling last month that would allow Daniel Giersch to keep their son and daughter, ages five and three, in France.

But the U.S.-based mother-of-two, who has vowed to appeal, said she has drained her earnings to pay off legal bills - and must keep working to afford the fight.

Speaking out: Kelly fought back tears during her appearance on The View yesterday

Rutherford, who married the German 
businessman in 2006, they separated three years later, when she was 
pregnant with their second child, and divorced in 2010.

A bitter custody battle ensued, and 
on August 28 Los Angeles Judge Theresa Beaudet ruled the children 
should remain in France with their father, who they'd been visiting over
the summer.

Complicating matters, Giersch's visa 
was revoked earlier this year and he has been banned from entering the 
U.S. As a result, the couple will continue to have joint legal and 
physical custody with Rutherford required to fly overseas for 
visitation.

Joined this morning by ABC News legal
consultant Dan Abrams, Rutherford spoke to Sherri Shepherd and 
Elisabeth Hasselbeck about the three-year ordeal, and her fears she will
be unable to keep fighting.

'I have to keep working to be able to
afford this [the custody battle]. I have been through pretty much 
everything,' Rutherford said. 'It’s just been crazy.'

Rutherford recalled her tearful reunion in France earlier this month with her son, five, and daughter, three, while blasting Giersch's parenting techniques.

'I last saw them ten days ago. My 
little girl said "I want to come home mama, I want to come back to New 
York." My son - who’s kind of been brainwashed that where he is is so much better - but he always says, "Mama, I love you so much."'

Fears: The actress, 43, said she worries the sudden change in custody will have a drastic negative impact the children

The judge gave custody to Giersch as 
it was his opinion that Rutherford had repeatedly tried to cut her 
ex-husband out their children's lives.

Opening up about what led to the 
breakdown of their marriage, Rutherford said today: 'I was pretty 
scared about what I was finding out about him, some very strange things 
happened... I said let's separate... and he just came at me.

'I don't think he would intentionally
harm the children... but I do think the children are at risk because I 
was the primary caregiver and now I am the visitor.'

The actress, 43, said she fears the sudden switch will have a drastic negative impact their children.

'They're just little babies,' she said.

'He could disappear tomorrow and I’d have no way to look. My biggest fear is that I wouldn’t know where they are.'

'I just want them to be okay. They’re just little babies. They need a chance to have a consistent life.'

Rutherford said she is consulting with lawyer Alan Dershowitz to get the children, who are American citizens, back to the U.S.

As ABC News reports, Dershowitz was a legal adviser in the Elian Gonzalez custody case.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Giersch is required to buy six round-trip coach airline tickets for his ex annually.

However, Rutherford, who said she 
travels to France as frequently possible, claims she is forced to 
maintain a busy work schedule to pay off her legal bills.

Giersch previously released a statement through his lawyer, Fahi Takesh Hallin, about the custody battle.

Hallin told ABC Giersch is 'focused on
co-parenting the children, and continuing to promote any and all 
contact of the children with Kelly.'
