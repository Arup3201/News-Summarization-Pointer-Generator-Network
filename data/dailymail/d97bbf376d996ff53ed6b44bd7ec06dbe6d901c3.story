The tenant of a penthouse in Washington DC is looking for someone to share his apartment with him – but he’s not looking for just any old roommate.

He wants a naked one.

According to an ad in Craigslist, the man is looking for a male roommate who is willing to be naked all the time and be fine with ‘some touching’.

Indecent proposal: The tenant says he's looking for a 'very attractive' male roommate willing to be naked and must be fine with 'some touching' but 'mostly looking'

‘Want to live in a penthouse in Chinatown for basically free ($1/month rent to make lease legal)? Then read on,' says the ad.

‘I'm
a male looking for another male (straight or bisexual w/girlfriend 
preferred, but masc gay is cool too) to be my naked roommate. Sounds 
crazy, but this is for real.’ 

The ad says the potential applicants should be 26 or younger and ‘very attractive’.

It says the arrangement would be 'mostly looking’ but that ‘some touching’ will be required, and how much and often 'is negotiable'.

It doesn't specify whether the tenant also plans to be naked.

According to D.C. landlord-tenant attorney Dorene Haney, the situation could have legal complications.

‘I
don't think the fear of eviction could be eliminated because you can't 
say certainly that the agreement would not be enforced,’ Haney told 
HuffPost by email.

‘And the landlord might try to evict the tenant, legally or not, if it were not performed...I don't think the nudity is illegal, but I don't know if a court would enforce that part of the agreement either.’

Hanley also said that ‘to the extent that the agreement regarding 'touching' is construed as an agreement for sex for money, it might be legally unenforceable,’ though it's hard to say if the rest of the contract would then be enforceable.

It has not been revealed who the man is, nor whether he has had any applicants so far.
