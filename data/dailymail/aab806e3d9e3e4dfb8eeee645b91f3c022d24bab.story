A teacher's scorned ex-boyfriend has been arrested for hacking into the man's email account and sending nude photos of him to hundreds of students, teachers and community members.

David A. Galvan, 38, was caught in Oregon last week after allegedly leaking the images of Richard Rosa, who works at John Muir High in Pasadena, California, earlier this summer.

He allegedly accessed Rosa's work email account in July while the science teacher was out of the country and sent emails because he was angry that their relationship was over.

He attached four shirtless photos the teacher, 31, had taken of himself, including two where the man's privates were also visible.

Galvan then allegedly sent them to as many as 287 people in the address book, including students, teachers and a member of the school board - with the subject: 'Enjoy.'

Several of the recipients called the police.

'A criminal investigation was launched and detectives learned that Rosa was not responsible for the e-mails and he was out of the country at the time the emails were generated,' Pasadena police Lieutenant Terysa Rojas said, the Pasadena Star News reported.

'Further investigation revealed the e-mails were sent by Rosa's estranged partner, David A. Galvan, who had unlawfully accessed Mr. Rosa's Pasadena Unified School District e-mail account. Suspect Galvan was reportedly angry over the relationship ending when he distributed the obscene pictures.'

On July 24, 2014, an arrest warrant was filed against Galvan for false impersonation, identity theft, internet/electronic impersonation and obscene matter. 

Victim: Rosa was not reprimanded by the school and hundreds of students signed a petition in support of him

When Galvan learned that he was wanted by police, he fled to Oregon but he was eventually detained on October 21 in Hillsboro, Oregon. 

Galvan waived an extradition hearing and was transported back to the Pasadena City Jail this week, before being transferred to the LA County Jail.

He posted bail and was released from custody on Thursday afternoon. He is scheduled to appear in court on November 21.

Rosa, who has been a teacher at the school since 2007, was not reprimanded by the school district in the aftermath of the incident.

The X-rated email sent from his account prompted School Superintendent Jon Gundry to issue a written apology to the recipients, KTLA reported at the time.

‘If you received this email, I would like to apologize for any harm this email might have caused and want to assure you that we are working with the relevant authorities to investigate the matter,’ he wrote. 

Even though he did not face termination, John Muir student Devin Perry preemptively launched a 'Save Mr Rosa' petition online, which received hundreds of signatures.

‘Mr. Rosa is one of the most professional teachers I know and I would hate for a great teacher to lose a job based on a mistake that may have been an accident,’ Perry wrote. ‘He's taught me so much and I don't want a teacher who has impacted lives to be turned down because of a mistake.’
