At just 23, it might be considered a risky move to retire from your day job.

But Rebecca Adlington said goodbye to a glittering career in swimming yesterday, safe in the knowledge that she will not struggle for work - or money.

In fact, Britain’s most successful female swimmer is already able to command up to £20,000-an-hour as an after-dinner speaker.

Despite her young age, a leading booking agent told the Mail that she was proving ‘popular’ with corporate clients because of her endearing ‘girl-next-door’ persona.

The double Olympic champion held a press conference in central London yesterday to announce her retirement from competitive swimming.

It is thought she could now forge a lucrative career as a television personality and motivational speaker.

A top London speakers’ agency quoted a 
fee of £20,000, plus expenses, for a 15-minute question-and-answer 
session and up to 45 minutes of ‘mingling’ afterwards.

This equates to £333-a-minute, but remains some way behind the £30,000 to £35,000 fee commanded by heptathlete Jessica Ennis, cyclist Sir Chris Hoy and Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London 2012 organising committee.

The agency said: ‘Rebecca is a very eloquent talker and can charge quite a high figure because she is so popular.

‘London 2012 athletes start from £4,000, but she would be around £20,000, plus expenses, for an hour-long appearance.

‘She is a very down-to-earth girl and
is the sort of person who would stay for longer than her allotted time 
and happily mingle with people afterwards.’ 

Yesterday,
she said she was quitting the sport because she said she wanted to 
‘finish on a high’ after winning two gold medals at the 2008 Beijing 
Olympics and two bronze medals at the London 2012 Games.

Lucrative career: Adlington, who was awarded the OBE from the Queen in 2009 (pictured), could command fee of £20,000 for a 15-minute question-and-answer session and up to 45 minutes of 'mingling' afterwards

The athlete has made no secret of her desire to follow in the footsteps of cyclist Victoria Pendleton and gymnast Louis Smith and star in BBC show Strictly Come Dancing.

But she admitted that she was worried about putting on weight after quitting her gruelling 25-hours-a-week training regime, saying: ‘I’m not exactly the smallest girl, am I?’ 

Looking glamorous in a sheer cream blouse and black skinny trousers, she said: ‘I’m going to miss being fit.

‘I have got to be careful.  

‘Everyone keeps saying to me, ‘Beck, get really fat and do a fitness DVD, and I’m like, ‘no, I don’t want to’. That’s not really my aim.’

Last month, Adlington wrote on Twitter: ‘First day of the diet/exercise/get fit today! 

‘Never really been on a diet before but then again never had such a long break out the pool.’ 

She
has been enjoying a more relaxed diet since the London 2012 Games and 
has posted photographs on Twitter of cupcakes and cakes, which she baked
herself.

After-dinner speaker: She is popular with corporate clients because of her 'girl-next-door' image

The young swimmer said she was now 
looking forward to spending more time with her family, including 
long-term boyfriend Harry Needs, a fellow swimmer with whom she shares a
house in Nottingham.

She also plans to launch a learn-to-swim scheme called Becky Adlington’s Swim Stars, saying: ‘I want all children when they leave school to be able to swim 25m - that’s my ambition in life’.

But her career as an after-dinner speaker could prove to be her most lucrative venture yet.

Adlington has enjoyed Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth titles during her career.

At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she not only won the 400m, but returned to the pool five days later to claim the 800m title, setting a world record which still stands today.

At 19, she became a household name and attracted sponsorship contracts with big-name brands such as Speedo and British Gas.

She came third in the 2008 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards and was awarded an OBE in the 2009 New Years’ Honours.

Yesterday she said: ‘I hate the word retire.‘I love swimming but as a competitive element and elite athlete I won’t compete any more.

‘I’ll always be swimming, even when I am 90 years old.’ 

The Mansfield-born swimmer said that, despite being in her early 20s, she felt too old to continue with long distance swimming, which takes its toll on the body’s joints.

She said: ‘I did feel old at 23. Female distance swimming is going a lot younger as was evident in London.

‘I can’t compete with that and can’t do the same level of work.

‘I need a lot more rest and recovery. I think it was the perfect time.’ Ends ‘I need a lot more rest and recovery. I think it was the perfect time.’
