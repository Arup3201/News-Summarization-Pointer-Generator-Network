Iran has launched a new satellite – its fourth in recent years.

The satellite – designed and built domestically – is capable of sustaining its orbit for 18 months and is named Fajr, which translates as dawn.

The launch comes amid negotiations with world powers over Iran’s contested nuclear programme.

International observers worry that its space programme is merely a precursor to designing rockets that could carry nuclear weapons.

But Tehran insists that its nuclear and space programmes are for peaceful purposes only.

President Hassan Rouhani announced the satellite's launch, claiming he had ordered the mission personally.

'Our scientists have entered a new phase for conquering space. We will continue on this path,' Rouhani said in a short statement on state television. 

He added the 52kg machine was designed to take photographs from space.  

It is believed to have taken eight minutes to reach orbit and has been in contact with ground-based controllers, Al Jazeera reports. 

Fajr is the first observations satellite launched by Iran since 2012. In 2010 the country sent one containing rats, turtles and insects into space, while another mission saw a monkey recovered alive in 2013.
