Police arrested a 35-year-old Tennessee woman on charges she falsely claimed to have cancer to raise money. 

Kristen Hines, of Clarksville, forged signatures of doctors at the Gateway-Vanderbilt Cancer Treatment Center to use as proof of a diagnosis and treatment, according to an arrest warrant. 

She then posted the forged documents on a Facebook page advertising her needs as a cancer patient. 

Kristen Hines, seen her in jail photos showing her trying to come off as someone who's undergone cancer treatment, managed to raise more than $200 million by tricking people into thinking she was a survivor

On her Facebook page, Hines had pictures of herself with a shaved head and comments from numerous supporters wanting to donate to her cancer treatments. 

Hines held a benefit in mid-August at the Warehouse Bar and Grill, the Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle reported.

She managed to collect more than $200.

Another benefit for this month was already in the works but was canceled after Hines' arrest.  

The Chickin 'n' Pickin Cancer Benefit hosted by the Montgomery County Conservation club was planned for September 27. 

Hines - also known as Kristen Rhonda Bible - already had a lengthy criminal history, with 21 counts of forgery, two counts of identity theft and one count of theft over $10,000 in early July

Tickets could be purchased in advanced or at the door for the event. Food, drinks and live music were to be offered.

Police say they stumbled upon Hines' scam after one of the doctors whose signature was forged on her documents contacted them. 

The cancer center employees became of aware of the cancer scam after people began calling their office asking to make donations to a Hines account that never existed.  

The doctor who contacted police confirmed she was never a patient at the center. 

Hines - also known as Kristen Rhonda Bible - already had a lengthy criminal history, with  21 counts of forgery, two counts of identity theft and one count of theft over $10,000 in early July, the Leaf-Chronicle reported, citing court records. 

An investigation began after a septuagenarian Cunningham couple told authorities that Hines, while acting as their caretaker, had charged $!6,000 to their debit card without their knowledge or consent.
