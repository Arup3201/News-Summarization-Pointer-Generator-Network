The gap in life expectancy between 
Britain's richest and its poorest areas has grown to as much as 13 years, it was revealed today.

A Government study 
has warned that 'health inequalities across the UK are increasing' as it emerged that the life expectancy of residents of Kensington and Chelsea is over a decade more than that of Glaswegians.

However, people all across the country are in general living longer. The average male life expectancy at birth now stands at 78.2 years, while for women it has reached 82.3 years.

In the past half decade, average 
lifespans have increased by more than a year, according to 
the Office for National Statistics.

But
Scotland still lags behind the rest of the UK, with life expectancy at 
birth of just 75.8 years for males and 80.4 years for females.

Even within England, those from the healthiest regions can expect to live two years longer than those from the least healthy.

Life
expectancy in the south-east is 79.7 for males and 83.5 for females, 
while in the north-west it stands at just 77.9 for males and 81.1 for 
females.

Although life expectancy has grown in every region of the UK over the past four years, in some areas the growth has been considerably faster than in others.

Growing differences appear to reflect increasing wealth in the South - 
particularly in the capital.

In London, life expectancy has grown by 1.6 years for males and 1.3 years for females.

The
report's authors suggest that London's advantage is 
owed not only to the capital's relative wealth but to 'the movement into
London of healthy, employed individuals at low risk of death'.

A regional breakdown of the figures shows that the longest-lived areas are all in the south of England.

Kensington
and Chelsea has the longest life expectancy by some way, with males 
expected to live to 85.1 and females to 89.8, which the study claims is 
the result of its 'very affluent' residents.

Its neighbouring borough Westminster is second, with other front-runners including areas of Dorset and Surrey.

In central Glasgow, by contrast, life expectancy is just 71.6 for males and 78 for females.

Several
other areas of Scotland are also lagging far behind the average, as 
well as industrial cities such as Manchester and Belfast.

The
ONS says that the UK's health gap is due to 'socio-economic status, 
health behaviour (for example, alcohol consumption and smoking), 
environmental conditions, the proportion of people living with 
deprivation, and the availability of local services and resources'.

The statistics covered life expectancy from birth in the period 2008-10, and compared them with the figures from 2004-6.

The study also looked at life expectancy for those aged 65, which has also increased across the UK.

A man who is currently 65 can expect to live a further 18 years, while a woman is likely to live another 20.6 years.

TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said the figures should send a 'stark warning' to a Government 'intent on forcing people to retire far later'.

He said: 'Life expectancy in deprived areas of the UK is increasing at half the pace of the wealthiest parts of London and the South. People living in these areas can also expect their retirement to be a decade shorter.'
