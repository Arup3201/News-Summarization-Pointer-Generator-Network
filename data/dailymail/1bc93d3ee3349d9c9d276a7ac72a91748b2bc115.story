Southampton fear Mauricio Pochettino will try to poach their top talent after he was confirmed as the new Tottenham manager on Tuesday.

The Argentine has signed a five-year deal worth up to £3.5million a season to replace Tim  Sherwood, who was sacked earlier this month.

Pochettino, who could make Saints striker Jay Rodriguez a top target, said: 'This is a club with tremendous history and prestige and I am honoured to have been given this opportunity to be its head coach. There is an abundance of top-class talent at the club and I look forward to starting work.

New man in charge: Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new manager of Spurs

'Tottenham have a huge following across the world and I have great admiration for the passion the fans show for this team. We are determined to give the supporters the kind of attacking football and success that we are all looking to achieve.'

Pochettino, 42, will be asked to coax the best out of record signing Erik Lamela, the Argentine who came from Roma for £30m. And he can expect a healthy budget to add to his squad, raising fears at St Mary's that he could return to recruit their top stars.

Spurs are interested in midfielder Adam Lallana and striker Rodriguez, who is recovering from a knee injury that looks likely to keep him sidelined for the start of the new season but has flourished under Pochettino's tutelage.

Moves for Lallana and Luke Shaw look out of reach as they head for Liverpool and Manchester United. But Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers, Nathaniel Clyne, Morgan Schneiderlin and James  Ward-Prowse have all excelled under Pochettino.

Heading to the Lane? Could Jay Rodriguez also follow Pochettino to Spurs?

Southampton will attempt to stop any flow of talent to Spurs but agreements restricting a club from signing a player from a rival are complex and could contravene EU regulations.

The South American formed a close bond with his squad during his 16 months at St Mary's and the prospect of following him could appeal to some players.

Shaw thanked Pochettino on Twitter, saying: 'Great manager, great guy and has helped me a lot. Wish him all the best.'

But Pochettino faced a massive social media backlash from Saints supporters.

The ex-Espanyol chief will bring his trusted aides Jesus Perez, Miguel D'Agostino and Toni Jimenez with him to Spurs.

Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said: 'In Mauricio I believe we have a head coach who, with his high energy and attacking football, will embrace the style of play we associate with our club. He has a proven ability to develop each player as an individual, while building great team spirit and a winning mentality. We have a talented squad that Mauricio is excited to be coaching next season.'
