Gun battles erupted between Thai police and anti-government protesters in Bangkok today killing four people and wounding dozens of others.

In a day of tangled developments in Thailand's long-running political crisis, the country's anti-corruption body announced it was filing charges against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra relating to a rice subsidy scheme that has fuelled middle-class opposition to her government.

The troubled rice scheme, already near collapse, suffered another blow when the Government Savings Bank said it was scrapping a loan to a state farm bank that could have been used to prop the scheme up in the face of a revolt by depositors.

The clashes were some of most intense between protesters and security forces since the campaign to unseat Yingluck began in November, and raised the prospect that the army might feel compelled to intervene if the bloodshed worsens.

The protests are the latest 
installment of an eight-year political battle broadly pitting the 
Bangkok middle class and royalist establishment against the poorer, 
mostly rural supporters of Yingluck and her billionaire brother, former 
premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

Reuters
 witnesses heard gunfire and saw police firing weapons in the Phan Fa 
Bridge area in the old quarter of the city. Police said they had come 
under fire from a sniper on a rooftop and M-79 grenades were also fired.

The policeman was killed by a gunshot and several were wounded by a grenade, security officials said.

The
 Erawan Medical Center, which monitors hospitals, said on its website 
that three protesters had also been killed by gunfire. The centre said 
64 people had been wounded. It did not provide a breakdown of how many 
of the wounded were police and how many were civilians.

Security
 officials said earlier that 15,000 officers were involved in the 
operation, 'Peace for Bangkok Mission', to reclaim protest sites around 
central Bangkok's Government House and other government offices in the 
north of the capital.

Yingluck
 has been forced to abandon her offices in Government House by the 
protesters, led by a former deputy premier, Suthep Thaugsuban, who have 
also blocked major intersections since mid-January.

Police
 said they had arrested 183 people at two protest sites at the Energy 
Ministry, which had been cleared of protesters, and Phan Fa Bridge, and 
were detaining them for violating a state of emergency declared last 
month.

Trouble started with 
clouds of teargas near Government House and soon police were crouching 
behind riot shields as officers clashed with protesters. It was not 
clear who had fired the teargas and the authorities blamed protesters.

By
 the afternoon, police had largely withdrawn from protest sites and the 
streets were quiet. National Security Council Chief Paradorn 
Pattanathabutr said top officials were meeting to decide whether to 
continue the operation on Wednesday.

There has been no move against the biggest protest sites in the city's commercial and shopping districts.

The
 protesters are trying to oust Yingluck, whom they view as a proxy for 
her elder brother Thaksin, a former telecoms tycoon-turned-premier, 
toppled by the army in a 2006 coup.

The
 military has remained aloof from the latest crisis, but has a long 
history of intervening in politics, generally in support of the Bangkok 
establishment that includes the top brass, royal advisers and old-money 
families.

'If enough people 
are killed then the arch-royalist grouping might pressure Yingluck to 
retreat from her pro-active approach towards Suthep,' said Paul 
Chambers, director of research at the Institute for South East Asian 
Studies in Chiang Mai.

'I don't think the military would carry out a coup, but they would ask Yingluck to back off from Suthep.'

Among
 the protesters' grievances is the rice subsidy scheme, a populist move 
to pay farmers an above-market price that has proved hugely expensive 
and run into funding problems.

The
 National Anti-Corruption Commission announced an investigation last 
month, and on Tuesday said it was summoning Yingluck to hear charges 
against her on Feb. 27.

'Although
 she knew that many people had warned about corruption in the scheme, 
she still continued with it. That shows her intention to cause losses to
 the government so we have unanimously agreed to charge her,' Vicha 
Mahakhun, a member of the commission, said in a statement.

The
 GSB had said on Sunday it had lent 5 billion baht ($155 million) to the
 Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, which manages the 
rice programme and has all but run out of money to pay farmers.

Some
 GSB depositors, either worried that the loan could destabilise the bank
 or unwilling to see their money used to help the government, have been 
taking out their cash. On Monday, 30 billion baht ($930 million) was 
withdrawn.

In a response to 
the withdrawals, Thaksin's son, Panthongtae Shinawatra, posted a picture
 on Facebook showing he had deposited just over 11 million baht in a GSB
 account.

The protests have 
taken a toll on the economy and data published on Monday showed growth 
slowed sharply in the fourth quarter of 2013. The baht currency weakened
 after Tuesday's violence.

Yingluck called a snap election in December and has since led a caretaker administration with only limited powers.

The
 main opposition party boycotted the Feb. 2 election and protesters 
disrupted it in parts of Bangkok and the south, the powerbase of the 
opposition. It may be many months before there is a quorum in parliament
 to elect a new prime minister.

Demonstrators
 accuse Thaksin of nepotism and corruption and say he used taxpayers' 
money for populist subsidies and easy loans that have bought him the 
loyalty of millions in the populous north and northeast.

They
 want to suspend what they say is a fragile democracy under Thaksin's 
control and eradicate his influence by altering electoral arrangements.

The
 government, haunted by memories of a bloody 2010 crackdown by a 
previous administration that killed dozens of pro-Thaksin 'red shirt' 
activists, has until now largely tried to avoid confrontation.

But
 Tuesday's fatalities brought to 15 the number of people killed in 
sporadic violence between protesters, security forces and government 
supporters since the demonstrations began. Hundreds have been hurt.

Bluesky
 TV, the protest movement's television channel, had earlier shown 
protest leader Suthep addressing police lines near Government House.

'We
 are not fighting to get power for ourselves,' Suthep said. 'The reforms
 we will set in motion will benefit your children and grandchildren, 
too. The only enemy of the people is the Thaksin regime.' ($1 = 32.2700 
baht)
