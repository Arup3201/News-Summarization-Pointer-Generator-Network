Chris Mumme owns the butcher on Darling Street less than 100 metres from where a convenience store went up in flames on Thursday morning

Lucky is not a word many would use to describe a situation where one has lost everything but their life. But those who survived a tragic fire which caused the death of three locals believe they are just that.

Chris Mumme, who owns the butcher on Darling Street, Balmain - just a few shops down from the rubble where a convenience store once stood - has not been able to access his shop nor his flat above since the blaze on Thursday.

He has lost thousands of dollars worth of meat as his store has been left without power since the explosion. However, he considers himself one of the more fortunate ones in this devastating event.

'It's really insignificant compared to what other people have had happened, I've lost my livelihood and my meat but I'm alive. I'm lucky', Chris told Daily Mail Australia.

He told of the toll the tragedy, in which Bianka O'Brien, 31, her 12-month-old son Jude, and another man Chris Noble, 27, were killed in had on the local community.

The convenience store's owner Adeel Khan, 44, was pulled from the rubble early on Thursday and taken to hospital along with two other men who jumped from the apartments above. 

'Everyone's in tears every five minutes, it's so overwhelming,' he revealed. Despite this, locals have banded together in a show of strength and solidarity and Chris said it's as though the suburb in Sydney's inner west is a 'country town'.

'We're pretty strong, we get knocked down we get up again, we've got no choice'.

'We're all the lucky ones in the context of it all but at the end of the day everyone's affected in different ways, and everyone has different coping mechanisms,' Chris added.

A woman who lived next door to the convenience store which went up in flames in the early hours of Thursday morning also told of how blessed she felt despite being left with almost nothing but the clothes on her back.

The blaze at 627-629 Darling Street, Rozelle, claimed the life of three people buried beneath the rubble

Apartments on either side were damaged and will be demolished, and a huge stretch of the street still remains blocked off 

Lynette revealed firefighters managed to salvage her mobile phone and handbag with her passport and drivers licence inside. However her house will have to be demolished.

'It is lucky, you've got your life and you've got your identity', she told Daily Mail Australia.

Local mother Cassandra Kilby has set up a Facebook group called Help For Rozelle Fire Residents to support those affected by the tragedy

The woman relived the moment the building beside hers went up in flames as she watched from the street after escaping. Lynette said the men who lived next door to her were distressed as they searched for their housemate.

'I could hear them calling, I thought it was Robbie Robbie but it ended up being Nobby Nobby when I first came out of the house,' she said, referring to Chris Noble's mates calling for their friend who passed away in the terrible fire.

'The fellow upstairs he was filming it and telling the fire brigade there was a back entry they should look at.'

'That woman, Bianka, and the baby, the fact that it was an internal stair that came in the front of the building and they had to exit via the shop...

'Just from the explosion that occurred and from the impact it had on my building - the same thing in her building? You just knew it was not good.'

Lynette also revealed some of the rumors flying around the town following the tragedy.

'There were so many stupid stories going around, saying oh you know the car that took them before the explosion was someone who abducted them and we're going that'd be good, then they'd be alive.'

Lynette is referring to reports that a silver sedan was seen speeding down the street away from the store shortly before it burst into flames. 

In a meeting held in Balmain Town Hall on Sunday morning authorities and local members of parliament addressed questions that locals had about their businesses, homes and community. 

The building was obliterated in the blaze, and raised concerns about asbestos in the area

The owner of the convenience store had to be pulled from the rubble after he was stuck under a commercial fridge when the building collapsed

Residents voiced their concerns over reports asbestos particles in the air, which authorities confirmed there were in fact none, and what the next steps to rebuild the strip were. 

A group - called Help For Rozelle Fire Residents - has already been created to assist victims of the tragedy, and at the head of that is Balmain woman Cassandra Kilby.

Cassandra knew Bianka and her little boy Jude and said what began on Thursday as a group for local mums to communicate with and support each other quickly turned into something bigger.

'It just started as a way that a group of mums that were acquainted with Bianka to have a means to continue to communicate and see what we could do, and from there it just grew', she told Daily Mail Australia.

Leichhardt mayor Darcy Byrne said the 'devastating cost' of the tragedy was the loss of human life 

Mayor of Leichhardt Darcy Byrne told reporters after the address that although the local economy would be severely affected by the fire and subsequent closure of Darling Street and many businesses, the real devastation was the loss of life.

'We've lost three of our people, including a small baby, that is the true devastating cost of this tragedy. Our economy will suffer for a time, but Rozelle will bounce back.

'We can't lose sight of the fact that the truly devastating consequence of this explosion is the loss of three of our people. We need to come together to offer every assistance we can to the victim's family and friends'. Mayor Byrne said.
