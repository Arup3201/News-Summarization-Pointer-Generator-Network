A Colombian man who keeps being struck by lightning has gone to extreme lengths to find a remedy - allowing villagers to bury him alive to try and rid him of the problem.

As if being hit four times in the space of six months was not enough of an ordeal, a healer in Colombia told Alexander Mandón he must submit to being lowered in to the earth up to his neck in order to rid him of his 'electrical charge'.

Not only that, the bizarre ritual had to be carried out twice when villagers first buried the 20-year-old  lying down, only to be told Mr Mandón must be buried upright in order for the 'cure' to take effect.

'Cure': An indigenous healer in Cereté, Colombia, recommended the man be buried alive after he was struck by lightning four times

Ordeal: Alexander Mandón had to go through the bizarre ritual twice after villagers first buried him lying down, instead of upright 

A news report by Colombian outlet Noticias Uno said the former soldier was discharged from the army after being hit by lightning for a third time in the space of a few months.

The report said it was thought he would be safe in his home town of Cereté, in northern Colombia, which is said to have little rainfall, but Mr Mandón was struck by lightning yet again.

The 20-year-old's aunt described finding her nephew 'lying on the floor, rigid' at a local cantina after hearing thunder.

Desperate Mr Mandón
 eventually sought the help of a local healer, who told him being buried
 up to his neck in earth would allow the soil to absorb inappropriate 
electrical charges in his body, according to the Huffington Post.

The 20-year-old dutifully followed the doctor's orders, allowing villagers to entomb him in soil.

But after spending several hours up to his neck in dirt, it was pointed out that he had to be buried upright - not lying down - and Mr Mandón had to go through it all again.
