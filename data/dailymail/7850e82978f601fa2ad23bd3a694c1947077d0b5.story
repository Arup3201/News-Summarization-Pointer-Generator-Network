A British man has told of the terrifying moment he was washed overboard from a yacht in the middle of the Pacific Ocean - then watched in horror as it disappeared from sight.

Andrew Taylor spent 90 minutes in freezing, stormy seas after a huge wave knocked him off the yacht he was sailing on earlier today.

The 46-year-old father from London was feared lost after he was swept out of view of his desperate crewmates around 2,500 miles from land.

But miraculously, after an hour of searching in horrendous weather conditions, Mr Taylor’s fluorescent life jacket was spotted.

The
 crew then performed a daring rescue operation which saw them expertly 
manoeuvre the boat close enough to Mr Taylor for one team member to grab
 hold of him.

He was dragged back onboard the boat alive.

Mr Taylor was treated by an onboard medic for hypothermia and shock

Mr Taylor, who was project director for food and drink deliveries to the Olympic Park during London 2012, was treated by an onboard medic for hypothermia and shock.

Mr Taylor had been changing a sail at the front of the 70ft yacht when a massive wave washed him overboard, snapping the safety line connecting him to the deck in the process.

Mr Taylor said: 'It all happened so quickly. I braced myself waiting for the safety line to kick in but the next thing I knew I hit the rudder.

'I didn’t know if anyone was looking for me or not - I didn’t know if they’d seen me. I heard nothing.

'I could see someone up the mast.

'Initially I thought it was a good thing because I knew they were looking for me but then I realised it might be a bad thing because it might mean they didn’t know where I was.

'I tried to turn myself so I could see the boat. I kept moving myself round, swimming round so I could see the boat, thinking it would be back really quickly.

'But it just got further and further away.

'I kept watching the boat, and then I saw the side of it. I thought that was a good thing, that it was turning round, but then I saw the back of it and I thought that wasn’t a good thing.

'I just heard a noise, then I got wiped out by a really big wave. That’s when the storm started - God, the storm was bad, it was horrible.'

Mr Taylor was taking part in the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, a global yacht race for amateur sailors.

Mr Taylor recovers in the boat after the rescue. It is only the fourth time in the Clipper Race¿s 18 year history that a competitor has fallen overboard. All were recovered

He was among 18 crew on the yacht, called Derry Londonderry Doire, which was halfway through a race from Qingdao, China, to San Francisco, USA.

Another yacht, OneDLL, responded to the mayday call and diverted their course but was not needed.

Both boats have since restarted racing.

It is only the fourth time in the Clipper Race’s 18 year history that a competitor has fallen overboard. All were recovered.

Justin Taylor, the director of the race, praised the efforts of the crew, led by professional skipper Sean McCarter, in recovering Mr Taylor.

He said: 'In these conditions a man overboard is swept away from the boat very quickly and visual contact can be lost in the swell.

'We have a well-rehearsed procedure to mark the position, stop racing and engaged the engine to search for and recover the crew member as quickly as possible.

'An hour and a half is a very long time to be in the water in these conditions but a combination of his sea survival training and seven months at sea as well as wearing a life jacket and dry suit will have contributed enormously to his survival.'

Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person ever to sail round the world alone non-stop, added: 'The sea can be a harsh environment and we rehearse every eventuality including a man overboard.

'The procedures were put into practice flawlessly by the crew in difficult conditions.

'It is a tribute to their training and determination that Andrew was successfully recovered.'
