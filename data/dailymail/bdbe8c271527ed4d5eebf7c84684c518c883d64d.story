On the road that runs adjacent to the Dique do Tororo lake directly in front of Salvador’s Arena Fonte Nova, a familiar ritual has been played out every single match day of this World Cup.

In the hours before kick-off, boys from the nearby slum houses have emerged to play football in the road. The best player has to play with one shoe off. Nearby, those not old enough to join in race up and down on bicycles with no tyres on.

Part of it is exhibitionism. The thousands of visitors pouring round the lake on the way to the stadium provided a ready-made audience.

Largely, though, these games simply represented a desperate desire to be involved in a tournament that never really belonged to them. For these kids have had no greater chance of watching a game taking place on their doorstep than they had of being picked to wear the famous yellow and green.

Instead, their World Cup experience comprised watching matches on shared TVs, some stationed on boxes in the street, some powered by stolen electricity. This was the World Cup for them and millions like them. And now even that is over.

There are two ways to view the disaster that befell Luiz Felipe Scolari’s Brazil team in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night. It can be seen as a sporting disappointment placed in proper context or as a symbolic humiliation of a population fast losing ways in which it can feel proud.

In a bar on Sao Paulo’s fashionable Avenue Paulista on Tuesday night — it cost £30 for beer, fried food and a seat in front of a TV — the patrons had forgotten about the game by the time the musicians struck up in an awning outside afterwards. Just a few miles away, though, a gang was breaking into a bus depot to set fire to a fleet of vehicles. Elsewhere in Sao Paulo, electrical shops were looted. Sirens wailed through the night, at times masking the fireworks that — on this occasion — symbolised desolation rather than celebration.

In Recife, on the north-east coast, mounted police broke up fights in the FIFA Fan Fest while in Rio gangs of youths attacked and robbed tourists outside the Copacabana Hotel.

The last time Brazil were humiliated on home soil at a World Cup — a comparatively tame 2-1 defeat by Uruguay in 1950 — they changed their kit as part of turning over a new leaf. They ditched their white shirts and chose the now famous yellow jerseys instead. So where now? Back to white or maybe black to show they are in mourning?

Like any social or civil unrest, the root causes run deep. This isn’t really about football. But with so much public money being ploughed into this bloated, middle class, corporate event, it was always likely that the fall-out would be grim if things went wrong on the field.

In the run-up to a tournament that millions in Brazil simply did not want, the public seemed to cut an unspoken deal with the authorities and with FIFA. If Brazil give us what we want on the pitch, we will tolerate this tournament. If they don’t, we will have our say.

Nobody, of course, thought for one moment that it would end like this. Defeat is one thing, humiliation quite another.

As the respected veteran journalist Gustavo Eduardo Poli, from TV Globo, told the BBC: ‘There will be anger. There is anger already but we don’t know the full reaction. Not yet.’

Brazil wept publicly. On TV they dissected the performance of Scolari’s team all morning. Reaction in the newspapers was colourful. ‘Go to Hell, Phil,’ declared one. Another merely congratulated the team who lost the 1950 World Cup final to Uruguay as being better than the current version.All that is froth, of course.

As Poli said, the chances are that the real, devastating impact of this sporting catastrophe will actually be played out in the coming days and weeks and nobody knows yet quite how bad it will be.Forget the TV pictures of the pretty girls crying in the stands as Germany humiliated Brazil in the Estadio Mineirao. Their pain is unlikely to have lingered much longer than it took to take a taxi home to the suburbs. The real anguish here will be felt by those at the other end of the lop-sided socio-economic pyramid. It will be felt by those still waiting for proper roads in Natal, a subway completion in Salvador (work began in 2001) and a proper drainage system in Recife.

They say that sport imitates life but not in Brazil it doesn’t. Here, it only serves to highlight the differences between one kind of life and another.

Only two outfield players in Scolari’s squad earn their living in the Brazilian league. When you consider that every member of the great Brazilian teams of the 1962 and 1970 World Cups played in South America then the disconnect felt by the public is clear.

These days, Brazil’s national league is a debt-ridden, under-performing shambles. Top clubs such as Corinthians and Flamengo are millions of pounds in debt. Others failed to pay player wages last season.

It’s no surprise then that Brazil’s brightest young players are hauled off to talent factories in Russia and Ukraine before being recycled -— at huge personal gain — into the European leagues when they are good enough.

The players of the national team couldn’t be further removed from those street kids in Salvador if they tried and the irony of this defeat by Germany is that a European game that has for so long been creaming off Brazil’s talent has now returned to kick sand in its face on its own shores and in front of its own disintegrating public.

The public in Brazil cannot soothe themselves — as we do in England and Italy and Spain — with the thought of the recommencing of successful domestic leagues and new forays in to the Champions League. These last few weeks represented the last chance for the Brazilians to see their own players for a while.

At times it has been tempting to believe that the Brazilian lower classes have taken something from this tournament.

The yellow and green bunting strung across the pot-holed roads of the favelas appeared to indicate patriotism. On the fringes of the beach-front Fan Fests in Fortaleza, Recife and Natal, meanwhile, locals have partied enthusiastically, drinking cheap weak beer dispensed by street hawkers and eating food grilled on makeshift barbecues.

On every street corner, though, have stood the Brazilian riot police, a constant reminder of just what might happen.

The Brazilian authorities are perhaps fortunate that the third-placed game their team play on Saturday takes place in Brasilia. A new town built in 1960, the capital — with its wide roads and Manhattan-style grid system — is as easy to police as anywhere.

The government do face an election in October, though, and it is hard to believe the ramifications of a World Cup that will now be remembered for only one game will not be felt at the polls.

Back in 1950, Brazil sank under the weight of that loss to Uruguay at their own Maracana. The Maracanaza (the Maracana Blow) hit like a hammer. Sixty-four years on, there is no reason to suspect the affect will be any different.

‘I played for 19 years,’ said Zizinho, a member of the 1950 Brazil team.

‘I won a few titles and yet  now I’m just remembered as a loser.’
