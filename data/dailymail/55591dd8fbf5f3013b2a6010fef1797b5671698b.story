He described himself as 'a funny hybrid between beauty therapist and tradie' who waxes his eyebrows and spends way too much time grooming his hipster beard.

Users of social media site Reddit decided that was enough to declare him Australia's biggest w***er.

The 28-year-old Sydney art director is enduring a major flaming for being upfront and personal about his style and grooming habits in a trade magazine article celebrating him as one of Australia's up-and-comers in the marketing industry.

The B&T interview was posted onto Reddit where users swarmed to comment on the 'w***er'

'I'm a funny hybrid between beauty therapist and tradie,' Mr Zankovic told B&T Magazine for an issue called 'Industry Fashionista.'

The senior art director at Play Communications goes on to say: 'My style generally resembles simple colours and quality. It's sort of effortless.'

He said he fits 'that Surry Hills mould' and gets called a hipster - even though he hates the tag.

'But you know .,. beard, no socks, drop crotch - which is really comfortable, especially for a dude who has a bit going on between his legs,' Mr Zankovic said. 

A copy of the article and photo were posted on the online notice board Reddit, captioned with the question 'Is this Australia's biggest w***er?' Hundreds of users posted responded in the afirmative.

Reddit's notoriously unforgiving users slammed Mr Zankovic as 'smarmy, pretentious, clueless, dimwitted, pathetic, dull, boring, desperate, needy'.

One user suggested he was just behind Prime Minister Tony Abbott as the most disliked Australian.

Others rallied to his defense, saying 'There's nothing wrong with him,' and pointing out, 'It's likely an article where the exact purpose is to ask about his style and is aimed at people interested in that'. 

Some blamed the presentation of the content, saying the magazine should have 'written/edited the piece better to make him look less pretentious'.

Others called for a ceasefire on the brutal comments, asking, 'Whatever happened to "Live and let live"?'

Said another: 'So many of you guys are being nasty for no reason here. Don't like this article/guy/style? Move on.'

Play Communications defended Zankovic, saying that the article 'doesn't reflect Jarryd's nature at all'

Zankovic’s company Play Communications released a statement to Daily Mail Australia saying, 'We were surprised by the tone of the article,'

'It certainly doesn’t reflect Jarryd’s nature at all. He’s a great guy who’s both talented and grounded,' the statement said.

'Although he’s always well-groomed, more than anything he was having a laugh at himself and general stereotypes,

'Some things have been taken out of context.'

On Zankovic's LinkedIn he labelled himself as 'Experientially minded, Digitally Spirited,' and that he was 'passionate about connecting the physical with the digital world'.

B&T magazine spoke out, condemning the attack on Jarryd Zankovic

B&T spoke out on their website, condemning the comments as 'a shocking troll attack'.

'When a young man who’s at the top of his game is flamed by such a bunch of jealous bastards, it is truly an indictment on society,' the magazine's editor David Hovenden said in an article titled, “Not Australia’s biggest w***er”.

'It needs to be pointed out that Zankovic was named as one of B&T’s 30 under 30; an achievement that is no mean feat and one that puts him at the top of our industry,'

'Despite what the faceless haters say Zankovic is not a w***er, but someone with a great sense of humour, a sense of styles and trends, a sense of himself and a great sense of purpose,'

'Anyone of the people in our photo spread could have been targeted, unfortunately for Zankovic, it was him.'
