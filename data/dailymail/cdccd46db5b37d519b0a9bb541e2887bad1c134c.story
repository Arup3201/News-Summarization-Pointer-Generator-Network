Mike Dean awarded Arsenal a controversial penalty in the 24th minute against Manchester City on Sunday, and questions have been asked as to whether the referee even saw the foul.

Replays highlighted on Match of the Day 2 appear to show the official looking away as Vincent Kompany blocks Nacho Monreal off the ball inside of the box at the Etihad.

Santi Cazorla scored the penalty as Arsenal went on to win 2-0 against the Barclays Premier League champions, putting a serious dent in their hopes of retaining the title over Chelsea.

City were left five points adrift of leaders Chelsea as Olivier Giroud later doubled Arsenal's lead in the 67th minute to record an unlikely away win.

Sportsmail's Graham Poll believes it was an 'excellent decision' by Dean to award Arsenal the spot-kick that got them on their way, regardless of whether the official was looking at the incident.

'Vincent Kompany made no attempt to play the ball and stood up to block Nacho Monreal as he attempted to run into the penalty area,' Poll told Sportsmail.

'Watching Kompany — and also watching where he was looking — confirmed the defender’s intentions and Dean will have seen that before pointing to the penalty spot.

'Although there was not a huge amount of contact, it was clearly a foul and an unnecessary one for the City skipper to make.'
