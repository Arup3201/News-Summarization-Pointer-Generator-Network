It is easy to sing hosannas for Max Verstappen, the boy who will make his Formula One debut for Toro Rosso next year at 17 years of age, becoming the youngest driver in the sport’s history.

He is a talented driver by all accounts and appeared precociously assured before the assembled media in the paddock in Spa this weekend. Many fellow racers here have given him a generous welcome to the most exclusive drivers’ club in the world.

Here is Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, speaking self-deprecatingly about Verstappen, son of Jos, the Dutch driver of the 1990s and early 2000s.

Ready for the challenge? Max Verstappen, 16, will become the youngest driver in the history of Formula One at 17 years old when he joins the Scuderia Toro Rosso team next season

Centre of attention: Verstappen was composed during his first press conference at Spa in Belgium this week after being announced as Toro Rosso's new driver 

‘I don’t know Max at all,’ said Button. ‘I knew his father because I raced against him, as did Fernando (Alonso) and Kimi (Raikkonen), I think. Somebody obviously thinks he’s ready for Formula One because they have given him the opportunity.

‘I got my drive with Williams when I was 19 years old. I wasn’t ready for Formula One. I was ready when I was 23. But I took the opportunity because it might not come again. Frank (Williams) phoned me up – I was in the pub with my mates having a pint of beer – and said, “Do you think you are ready for Formula One?” I said: “Definitely not”. He said: “OK, right, thank you.”

‘I put the phone down and phoned my dad and he said, “You’re kidding me!” He said: “phone him back and tell him you are.” So I called him back and said I was ready. Frank invited me to the factory and that’s how it all started – I got the test and got the drive. 

'For anyone who comes into the sport and is given the opportunity, as a driver, a dad or a manager, you have to take it. Whether Max is ready, nobody knows.’

Button was being very fair. He raised doubts about the suitability of a 17-year-old – which will make him two years younger than the youngest previous driver, Jaime Alguersuari – but cautioned us against judging Verstappen by his own standards between the age of 19 and 23.

Jacques Villeneuve, a former team-mate of the young Button at BAR Honda, was less sympathetic towards the experiment.

The 1997 world champion, who made his F1 debut aged 24, said: ‘Basically, it’s like getting all the presents without deserving anything. But there is this thing of “the younger, the better”. What's the next step? A team who will sign someone at 15 just to get the image out of it?

‘It is the wrong way round. Caesar and Napoleon were good from the beginning but it takes time before you become an emperor. You build it.

‘He is still a boy so it is very risky. You don’t take a 16-year-old, who hasn’t even been to university, into the best hospital as a doctor, even if he is very good and very intelligent.

‘You need to pay dues. You need to deserve it because that is only how you will become a man.’

Speaking to Autosport, Villeneuve added: ‘Getting a Super Licence (a prerequisite for Formula One) should be meaningful – not just doing three hundred kilometres and it being fine.’

I tend to agree with many of Villeneuve’s observations. Formula One should be the pinnacle; the final logical step in a career through various formulas.

That a boy who only started racing cars this year, in Formula Three, can be deemed able to drive in Formula One may reveal how easy it is – in comparison to years gone by – to drive these cars. 

When Susie Wolff, of Williams, stepped in to test earlier this season, she was alarmingly close to the team’s regular race driver Felipe Massa on the timesheets, and, by all accounts, she is hardly Stirling Moss.

But more than anything I hope Max is not burned in the exercise. Being a former Formula One racer while still in his teens would be an unwelcome conclusion to an astonishingly youthful beginning.

Bernie Charles Ecclestone, 83 years old, is back in command behind the opaque glass – from the outside that is – of his portable HQ.

I suspect the underground movement that pressed for change in their longed-for post-Bernie era will fall silent again now that he is not going to jail for bribery. It was always thus in Formula One.

Back in charge: Bernie Ecclestone talks to reporters at Spa in advance of the Belgian Grand Prix. He is once again able to concentrate his energies fully on Formula One following the end of his bribery trial in Germany

One senior paddock figure told me that he would like to excise the whole current crop of drivers. They are, he thought, too highly trained in the dark, spin-doctoring wiles of saying nothing interesting.

This view is not entirely misplaced. Nico Rosberg, for example, was coy despite being angry with Lewis Hamilton for not moving over as instructed during the last race in Hungary. Perhaps he was being smart, but some former drivers would have given vent to their feelings. Or, to put it another way, told it how it was.

Ditto with Marussia’s Max Chilton and the curious issue of whether he would race this weekend in Belgium. He provided no explanation for his reinstatement a day after announcing he would sit out the grand prix.

However, we journalists are not entirely blame-free in all this obfuscation. We criticise people for small slips of the tongue. They clam up more. The relationship between press and participant worsens. It is a vicious circle.

Guarded: Nico Rosberg had little to say on Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes team orders in his press conference ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix
