A Texas man was convicted of his 10th DWI and will face life in prison for his dangerous actions.

Bobby Gene Martin, 64, was found guilty by a jury of driving while intoxicated as well as threatening to kill the officer who arrested and him and go after his family.

Jurors were shocked to find that the man already had nine prior convictions and was still driving, Kyle Crowl of the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said.

Bobby Gene Martin, 64, was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences after being arrested for his 10th DWI in August 

They were only informed that he had been found guilty of drunk driving at least three other times, enough to make his most recent case a felony.

Martin, whose first DWI was in 1981, will be 80 before he is eligible for parole during his two concurrent life sentences.

'I think that resonated with the jury that if no matter what he does, if he ever gets out of jail, he’s going to do it again' Mr Crowl told the Montgomery County Police Reporter.

The driver, who was living in Houston during his most recent arrest in August, also threatened a police officer and his family in 1999 and once went on a racist rant towards a jailer.

He has previously been sentenced to prison three times for drunk driving, in 1986, 1996 and 1999. 

The man also served time starting in 2012 for evading arrest with a vehicle. 

It is unclear whether he attended substance abuse treatment programs either inside or out of jail.

Martin's DWI arrests stretch back to the 1980s, and he has gone to prison three times for drunk driving 

Martin had seven previous DWI convictions when he was arrested in 2009 after being found a ditch with the motor still running according to the Houston Chronicle.

His blood alcohol content level was .21, more than double the legal limit in Texas.

He was arrested for a string of drunk driving incidents in the early 1980s: January 1981, February 1982, June 1982 and October 1982. 

More arrests followed in June 1987, September 1993, August 1996, January 1999 and March 2009. 

The incidents happened across the greater Houston area in Harris County, Waller County and Montgomery County.
