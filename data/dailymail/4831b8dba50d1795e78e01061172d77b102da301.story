Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is suing the makers of a film allegedly loosely based on events in his life.

Welcome To New York, which premiered in Cannes this weekend, stars Gerard Depardieu as sex-addict Mr Deveraux, whom, including other exploits, rapes a hotel maid.

Strauss-Kahn's lawyer said today this makes the film defamatory, as the storyline is similar to the accusations the French statesman faced in a sexual assault case in 2011.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn's lawyer said Welcome To New York is defamatory, as the storyline is similar to the accusations he faced in a sexual assault case in 2011

A scene from the film Welcome to New York, which is loosely based on the rise and fall of former French presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss-Khan

The French 
statesman was arrested in 2011 just as he was preparing a bid to become 
the next French president, accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York 
chamber maid, of trying to rape her.

Lawyers
 for Mr Strauss-Kahn proved that a sex act which took place was 
consensual, but he was forced to step down from his $500,000 a-year job 
at the International Monetary Fund.

Diallo
 then sued Mr Strauss-Kahn, but the two sides reached a financial 
settlement late last year, the details of which have never been 
disclosed.

‘This happened three years ago and he was cleared,’ lawyer Jean Veil told Europe 1 radio on Monday.

‘He is frightened, sickened (by the film). He has instructed his lawyers, myself, to make a complaint for defamation based on accusations of rape, on the insinuations made throughout this film.’

In the film, Mr Deveraux is seen taking part in several alcohol-fulled orgies involving prostitutes in a New York hotel room while on a business trip, before raping a hotel chambermaid as she comes to clean the room the next day.

Deveraux is then arrested, given a full strip search captured in an unflinching single shot, before another harrowing flashback sequence shows him sexually assaulting a female journalist sent to interview him. 

The 
two-hour film, which also stars Nip/Tuck actress Jacqueline Bisset as 
the character Mr Deveraux’s wife, premiered at the festival on Saturday 
with a private showing.

The
 film will not be shown in French cinemas but will be released on 
video-on-demand websites. It will appear in cinemas in other countries 
however, including the UK, at a later date.

Before
 the screening Depardieu , director Abel Ferrara and Jacqueline Bisset, 
took to the stage of The Star cinema to introduce the film.

Depardieu 
said he 'disliked politicians' and was 'happy' to participate in the 
film, while Mr Ferrara said Depardieu had not only agreed to act in the 
film but also put up 'half the money'.

Mr
 Ferrara has defended himself against the accusations from Strauss-Khan,
 saying he has artistic freedom and can choose his fictitious storylines
 as he pleases.

In the explicit film, Mr Deveraux is shown raping a chambermaid, also in a New York hotel

'I’m not on trial,' Ferrara told Reuters TV in Cannes this weekend.

'I’m an artist, I have freedom of speech. I’m from America I’m from the country of the free, land of the free and home of the brave.'

Since the premiere the film has received mixed reviews, with US actor Mickey Rourke saying it was Ferrara's best film in years.

Rourke also praised Depardieu as having 'more courage than any other living actor today', according to Yahoo, while French director Claude Lelouch also hailed his performance.

However, The Telegraph called the film 'superficial and pretentious', giving it just two stars out of five.

Before the screening Vincent Maraval, producer of the film, said the French elite tried to block the  there is an ‘incestuous relationship between the media and political elite’ in France.

He told the Independent: ‘No French TV station wanted to finance us.

‘Everyone warned us not to make this film, both our friends and our enemies.’
