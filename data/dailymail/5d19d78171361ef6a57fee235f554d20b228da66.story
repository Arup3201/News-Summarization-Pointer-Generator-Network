Leaders Bristol City overcame a second-half MK Dons fightback to win 3-2 and maintain their five-point lead at the top of Sky Bet League One.

A seventh win in 10 league games seemed assured when Kieran Agard had netted twice in the first half but goals from Dean Bowditch and Benik Afobe levelled things up after 73 minutes.

But the Dons - who slip from second to fourth - were level for less than two minutes as Wade Elliott's second goal of the season ensured all three points for the Robins.

Peterborough moved up to second with a first win in four games. Conor Washington popped up with the decisive goal on the stroke of half time in the 1-0 win against Fleetwood.

Sheffield United recovered from falling behind in the 83rd minute to secure a 2-1 win over Gillingham, with Jamie Murphy scoring the winner seven minutes into stoppage time.

Leyton Orient began life without Russell Slade by squandering the lead twice in a 3-2 defeat to Rochdale, who had Ashley Eastham sent off.

Jobi McAnuff and Romain Vincelot both put the O's ahead, but Matt Done and Peter Vincenti replied on each occasion before Done popped up again to net the winner as Chris Dagnall's first-half penalty miss proved costly.

Barnsley have now gone five games without a win as Swindon made it 10 goals in three outings with a 3-0 win at Oakwell.

Marvin Elliott scored his first goals for Crawley, netting twice to earn the Reds a 2-0 win at home to Yeovil.

Colchester scored three quickfire goals to consign Crewe to a seventh defeat of the season. Freddie Sears, Rhys Healey and Sanchez Watt all netted in the opening 22 minutes of the second period to secure a 3-0 win.

Bradford and Port Vale shared a 1-1 draw, as did Chesterfield and Notts County, while Walsall recorded a 3-0 win over Doncaster.
