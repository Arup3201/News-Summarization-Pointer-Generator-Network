Bills for long-term care in old age are to be capped at £75,000 in England, in a £1billion move to be funded by dragging more people into the inheritance tax net, it was announced today.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that the 'historic' reforms would save thousands of people from having to sell their family home to pay for care and give them  'greater peace of mind'.

'We need to become a society where people prepare and plan for their social care costs as much as they prepare and plan for their pension,' he said, adding that all governments have 'long failed to tackle' the issue.

Announcement: Heath Secretary Jeremy Hunt makes a statement to MPs in the House of Commons in central London where he said that that elderly care bills are to be capped at £75,000

'Whilst there are many other things 
that need to be done to prepare for an ageing population, these reforms 
do herald a historic change in the way that care and support is funded 
in this country.'

The inheritance tax threshold will be
frozen until at least 2019 to help fund the £75,000 cap on care home 
bills for the elderly. It means that thousands more middle-class 
families every year will be dragged into paying the 40 per cent tax.

Sources
close to Chancellor George Osborne confirmed that some of the funding 
for radical reform of social care will come from an unexpected freeze in
the amount people can inherit free of tax.

Stealth tax? Sources close to George Osborne say the inheritance tax threshold is to be frozen to fund a £75,000 cap on care home bills

The move risks angering Conservative MPs
who remember Mr Osborne pledging in 2007, before the financial crisis, 
to increase the threshold to £1million.

Instead it has been fixed at £325,000 since the election and will remain at that level until at least April 2019. The Coalition will announce today that the state will fund all social care for any individual once the £75,000 cap has been reached. 

The state will also begin to help with costs if a person’s savings and assets fall below a threshold of £123,000, rather than £23,250 at present.

But the National Pensioners Convention argues that the £75,000 cap is too high and warns that elderly people will continue to lose their homes as they grapple to meet mounting care costs.

The reforms are expected to cost £1billion a year, 80 per cent of which will come from increased employer national insurance contributions – mainly in the public sector – as a flat-rate state pension replaces the state second pension.

But the remaining 20 per cent will come from the inheritance ‘stealth tax’. 

If the threshold for the tax, frozen since 2009, increased in line with inflation every year until 2019 it would be expected to reach £420,000.

But instead it will be fixed at £325,000 – although just two months ago the Chancellor suggested he would increase the allowance in two years.

As a result, 5,000 more families a year 
are expected to be pulled into the inheritance tax trap, and will pay an
average of £95,000 more than they would have done if the allowance had 
been increased.

George Osborne's pledge in 2007

A Government source said: ‘The result of the social care reforms will be that 100,000 people who would have had to pay will be helped. The inheritance tax allowance has been frozen since 2009, but it’s also been made transferable so a couple now has a threshold of £650,000.

‘Yes, it will bring 5,000 more people into inheritance tax but it will help more than 100,000 who currently suffer for daring to do the right thing and saving for retirement.

‘Those who have worked and saved all 
their life and bought a property won’t have it taken away just because 
they did the right thing. That’s only fair.

‘We are going to protect their inheritance.’

However, Conservative MPs expressed alarm.

Right-winger Peter Bone said: ‘It starts to look as if we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other.’

The Coalition is setting the £75,000 cap despite the Dilnot Commission, established by Government to review care funding in England, recommending a lower benchmark.

The commission proposed a cap of between £20,000 and £50,000 and said £35,000 would be 'the most appropriate and fair' figure.

But chairman Andrew Dilnot said the difference between the recommendation and the Government's figure is not large enough to create problems.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'We said it should be between £20,000 and £50,000 in 2010-11 prices.

'The cap being proposed is £75,000 in 2017 prices, that’s the equivalent of £61,000 in our terms, £11,000 higher than the top end of our range.

'But I recognise that the public finances are in a pretty tricky state and it doesn’t seem to me that it is so different as to radically transform the basis of the system.'

But Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention (NPC), said: ‘People are still going to lose their homes to pay for this, £75,000 is a hugely high cap.

'In actual fact, Dilnot said 35 or 50. But in any case, we didn’t think Dilnot was the right answer either because it doesn’t deal with the actual care system.'

Ms Gibson called for a 1.5p in the pound income tax to pay for a national care system 'free at the point of delivery'.

Neil Duncan-Jordan, also from the NPC, said he could see little difference between the freezing of the inheritance tax threshold and Labour’s plan before the election for a ‘death tax’ to pay for care.

Ros Altmann, a former adviser to the Treasury on pensions, said relatively  well-off pensioners with expensive houses – particularly in the South-East – would be hit by the inheritance tax changes.

‘Many people who end up not needing any expensive care in their old age will end up paying lots of inheritance tax to those who do,’ she added.
