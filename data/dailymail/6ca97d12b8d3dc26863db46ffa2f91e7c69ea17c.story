It has no running water, mains electricity or loo, but this beach hut is on the market for £126,000 – enough to buy you a house in some parts of the country.

The one-room hut measures 13ft by 12ft and is on a sandy spit of land accessed only by a small ferry, a long walk or a novelty ‘Noddy’ train (though the train and ferry don’t run on week days in winter).

Estate agents say it is its remoteness and inaccessibility that make the location, Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, Dorset, so desirable.

The one-room hut on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch in Dorset measures 13ft by 12ft and is accessed only by boat or a novelty "Noddy" train

It boasts some of the best vistas across 
Britain's most picturesque beaches and further out to sea including the 
Needles on the Isle of Wight.

The shack does have solar panels that provide electricity for lighting and it includes a gas powered cooker and fridge.

It has a shared shower block on the sandy spit that is so desirable because of its remoteness and inaccessibility.

Four
people can sleep in the hut during the summer months and it has 
stunning views out across Christchurch harbour and also to the Isle of 
Wight.

From the spit you can see Christchurch priory, the longest parish church in Britain.

The asking price is the same cost as a house in some northern towns and is as much as a top-of-the-range Bentley Continental car.

But estate agents doubt the price tag, or the fact it can only be accessed by boat, a long walk or a novelty ‘Noddy’ train, will put off potential buyers.

Basic: The kitchen area in the small hut has no running water or mains electricity

Chalet number 4, on Beach Road, in
West Bexington, Dorset, became one of the world's most expensive beach 
huts when it sold for £235,000 in 2006

The felt-roof hut had a sitting 
room measuring 2.85m by 2.59m, a kitchen which was 1.3m by 4.11m, a 
toilet and one bedroom measuring 2.87m x 2.62m.

It had running water, drainage and 
mains electricity, a garden, the potential for off-site parking and can 
be lived in all year round.

The new owner won a heated five-way auction held in Sherborne, Dorset, to snap up the hut.

Andrew Denison, of Denisons Estate 
Agents in Christchurch, who is selling the leasehold for hut number 219,
said there has already been a lot of interest.

He is currently getting on his bicycle for viewings because the small ferry and train don’t run during week days in the winter.

He said: ‘We’ve had quite a few enquiries already.

‘It’s
quite a rare opportunity because beach huts like this don’t come on to 
the market very often - they tend to get handed on to friends and 
family.

‘The prices haven’t really gone down and because they rarely come up for sale they remain in demand.

‘This is made from wood and is little more than a shed, but it is well constructed and has an asphalt roof.

‘Access
is by boat or the Noddy train, but they don’t always run during the 
week in the winter so we are getting there by bicycle to give viewings.

‘There
is no mains electricity or running water, but there are Calor gas 
bottles that provide for the heating and cooking and power the fridge.

‘Solar
panels on the roof add extra power for the lighting and top up the 
battery. There is no toilet, but there is a shower block.

Water is from a stand pipe and on about four occasions a year it is opened up to vehicles so owners can move things in and out.

‘It sleeps four and there are people on the spit who sleep there all summer and commute to work.

‘You
can sleep there between March and October, but you can visit during the
rest of the year and a lot of owners meet up on New Year’s Day.

‘There are great views both towards the harbour and out to sea and it is a desirable place because it is not easily accessed.’

Whoever buys the yellow painted hut 
will also have to fork out an annual ground rent of about £2,500 a
year that is payable to the local council.
