A Wisconsin couple has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against a popular caregiver website they had used to hire a nanny accused of killing their infant daughter.

A lawsuit filed by Nathan and Reggan Koopmeiners in Kenosha County Circuit Court names both the company, Care.com, and nanny Sarah Gumm as defendants.

Gumm, 35, is jailed in Lake County, Illinois, where she is charged with first-degree murder in the 2012 death of 3-month-old Rylan Koopmeiners.

Finger of blame: The parents' lawsuit alleges that  Care.com failed to reveal that Gumm had a record, including two citations for drunken driving and a battery incident

The woman stands accused of causing a head injury that resulted in the baby's death at her home in Waukegan, Illinois.

The Koopmeiners allege Care.com, based out of Waltham, Massachusetts, failed to reveal that Gumm had a court record, including two citations for drunken driving and a battery incident - even though they paid for the highest level of background check available on the site.

Care.com issued a statement in response to a request for comment.

‘While we remain deeply saddened by these events, we cannot comment on matters of ongoing litigation,’ the company said.

However, a representative of the online business has challenged the Koopmeinerses' claim that they had ordered a background check on Gumm, telling HLN-TV that the couple did not take advantage of the service.

The wrongful death lawsuit alleges Gumm was drunk when the baby's head injury occurred.

The child suffered a skull fracture and cranial hemorrhaging and died July 27, 2012, from blunt force trauma, according to an autopsy.

Crime scene: Gumm was looking after the three-month-old girl at her home in the 1100 block of O'Farrell Lane in Waukegan on July 27, 2012

Kenosha News reported that the family are seeking monetary damages for medical and funeral expenses, pain and suffering, and loss of companionship, claiming that they would not have hired Gumm had it not been for the alleged negligence of Care.com.

Gumm's attorney Jed Stone said he understands why the Koopmeiners would ‘thrash about’ looking for justice, but said Gumm did not intentionally cause the baby's death.

‘The loss of a child is unimaginable. The loss of an infant child is heartbreakingly unimaginable,’ Stone said Friday. But that doesn't mean Gumm is a killer, he added.

Defense: Gumm's lawyer has insisted that his 'loving and caring' client had no intention of harming baby Rylan

In August 2012, Gumm was charged with killing baby Rylan by slamming her head down on a wooden table when the child started squirming around while being changed.

Nathan and Reggan Koopmeiners dropped their daughter off at Gumm’s home in the 1100 block of O'Farrell Lane in Waukegan at about 6.45am on July 27, 2012.

At about 4.30pm, the baby sitter called police and reported that the little girl was not breathing. She was rushed to Vista East Medical Center in Waukegan, where she was pronounced dead shortly after 5pm, according to prosecutors.

Gumm had initially told police that the three-month-old had been sleeping when she heard a ‘gurgling noise’ and noticed that the baby seemed to be in distress, prompting the caregiver to call 911.

During an interview with police in August of that year, Ms Gumm allegedly admitted to causing Rylan's injuries because the little girl was getting fussy and the woman became frustrated with her.

The baby’s parents, who have three other children, hired Gumm six weeks prior to the tragic incident after seeing an advertisement for her services on Care.com.

The nanny's lawyer said this week that he is in ongoing discussions to resolve the criminal case short of a trial in September.

In a statement, Jed Stone called his client a 'loving and caring person' who had no intention of hurting Rylan in any way.
