A UKIP council candidate claims he was stabbed in the face by a Muslim  who lives nearby and whose children regularly attack his own offspring and call his family infidels.

Bobby Anwar, 33, of Accrington, Lancashire,  said in a post on social networking site Facebook that he was  attacked by a man whose family are 'avid Labour supporters'.

He said the male had used a 'sharp metal weapon' in the attack on  Saturday which fractured his cheekbone and eye socket and claims he will need  extensive surgery.

He also alleges that the family's teenage children have attacked his own  children and regularly call his family 'kafir', a derogatory term which means  infidel.

A UKIP spokesman said: 'The injuries to Bobby Anwar are shocking and any  violent attack is a horrifying occurrence.'

Mr Anwar is running for a seat on Hyndburn Council.

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said they were investigating reports of an  assault, adding: 'The victim was approached in the street and punched to the  face causing a suspected fracture of an eye socket.

'He was taken to hospital  for treatment. Police enquiries are ongoing and a 38-year-old man from Accrington has been  arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and bailed  pending further enquiries.'
