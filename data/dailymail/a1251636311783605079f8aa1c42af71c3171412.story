Colonel Gaddafi has insisted his regime is still alive in Libya and labelled the rebel takeover of all but a few pockets of the country a 'charade'.

The Libyan leader got his defiant message out on a Syrian-based satellite station, Al-Rai TV, that has become his main mouthpiece since Tripoli fell last month.

There was no audio in the message, but he urged supporters to continue fighting and said NATO airstrikes in the country would not last forever.

He spoke ahead of U.S. President Barack Obama's speech at the United Nations, at which he pledged to support Libya's fledgling government.

He met the National Transitional Council's chairman, Mustafa Abdel Jalil in a one on one before praising the international community - who he said should take pride in liberating the country.

Defiance: Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has claimed rebel gains in the country are a 'charade' in a message broadcast on Syrian Arraj TV

Gaddafi issued his defiant message just as rebel forces seized the airport and fort in Sabha, one of the last strongholds of forces loyal to Gaddafi which also controls the main route south out of Libya.

Ahmed Bani, a military spokesman for the National Transitional Council (NTC, said: 'Our forces are there in the airport and in the castle... our flags are flying there.'

Sabha, 480 miles south of Tripoli and overlooked by an old fort built by Libya's former Italian colonial rulers, controls the main road into neighbouring Niger, an escape route used by members of Gaddafi's entourage.

Any advance on the town would be an important boost for government forces who have struggled to contain disunity in their ranks and faced stark reversals on the battlefield.

In hiding: Gaddafi has disappeared since Tripoli fell last month, but has sent repeated messages to Syrian TV stations

Nearly a month after Gaddafi was driven from power, his loyalist holdouts have beaten back repeated assaults by NTC forces at Bani Walid and Sirte.

NTC forces with rocket launchers and artillery gathered outside Sirte yesterday, preparing for a fresh assault as hundreds of families fled the town.

Humanitarian groups have voiced concerns over reported conditions in the town.

Electricity and phone lines have been cut off and residents said homes and cars had been destroyed.

Abubakr, a resident fleeing Sirte, said: 'People are fed up. There are explosions going off everywhere and you don't know where the bullets will come from next.

'Bullets are coming down from above. People are just firing randomly.'

The NTC had denied claims by Gaddafi's spokesman that 17 mercenaries - some of them British and French - were captured in the fight for Bani Walid.

Moussa Ibrahim did not offer any proof of his claim, but said the men were technical experts and included consultative officers.

He said: 'Most of them are French, one of them is from an Asian country that has not been identified, two English people and one Qatari.'

French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said there were 'no French mercenaries in Libya', while the British Foreign Office said it had no information on the report.

Western nations have sent special forces in the past, and media reports have revealed private security firms aided the rebels in training, targeting and leadership.

NTC forces yesterday arrested pro-Gaddafi mercenary leader Belqasem Al-Abaaj, who had been operating in the south of the country.    

However, the NTC, still based in the eastern city of Benghazi, has faced questions about whether it can unify a country divided on tribal and local lines.

A long-promised attempt to set up a more inclusive interim government fell apart on Sunday night when interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril 
failed to receive backing for his new cabinet.

The support shown by President Obama and other world leaders in New York is therefore particularly timely.

Mr Obama promised the Libyan people that the world will stand with them as they reshape their country following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime.

He warned that there would still be difficult days ahead as Gadhafi loyalists make a final stand and the country's provisional leadership grapples with the complex task of setting up a new government.

But Obama said it was clear that Libya was now in the hands of the people.

'After decades of iron rule by one man, it will take time to build the institutions needed for a democratic Libya. I'm sure there will be days of frustration,' Obama said.

'But if we have learned anything these many months, it is this - do not underestimate the aspirations and will of the Libyan people.' 

'Just as the world stood by you in your struggle to be free, we will now stand with you in your struggle to realise the peace and prosperity that freedom can bring,' he said.

Obama praised the international community for having 'the courage and the collective will to act' in Libya.

He said that while global powers cannot and should not intervene every time there is an injustice in the world, there are occasions when nations must join forces to prevent the killing of innocent civilians. 

'Our international coalition stopped the regime in its tracks and saved countless lives, and gave the Libyan people the time and space to prevail,' Obama said. 

The U.S. now recognszes the NTC as Libya's legitimate government. Obama announced Tuesday that the U.S. ambassador was heading back to Tripoli to lead a newly reopened American embassy there. 

Obama called on Jalil and other NTC leaders to ensure a timely democratic transition in Libya, including free and fair elections. 

Obama said the NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya will continue as long as civilians are threatened.

And he urged Gaddafi loyalists to lay down their arms and join the new Libya, declaring, 'the old regime is over.'

'Today, the Libyan people are writing a new chapter in the life of their nation,' Obama said.

'We will stand with you in your struggle to realise the peace and prosperity that freedom can bring.'

He said the U.S. ambassador was now on his way back to Tripoli and 'this week, the American flag that was lowered before our embassy was attacked will be raised again.'
