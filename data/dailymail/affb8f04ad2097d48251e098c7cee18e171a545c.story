According to reports in Spain Real Madrid are closing in on £12million rated Cruzeiro midfielder Lucas Silva. 

Despite revealing Madrid are one of his two favourite teams in Europe - along with Spanish rivals Barcelona - Silva has also been linked for a move to Arsenal.

What kind of player is he?

A very modern Brazilian – not a flair player but unflappable in the holding midfield role. He can dictate the pace of a game and organize a team. He has a great first touch and good awareness. And he’s only 21 so he has plenty of years ahead of him to adjust to European football. He also has a reputation for being level-headed and willing to learn and improve – essential if he’s to fit in at a big club and learn a new language.

Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Arsenal have all expressed an interest in Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva

And he’s done well in Brazil?

Cruzeiro have just won the league there and his consistent displays throughout the season were important in that success. He was named in the league’s team of the season at the end of the campaign.

Price?

Cruzeiro president Gilvan de Pinho Tavares has said he will not negotiate for anything less than £12million. He also knows there are several clubs interested with Real Madrid, Inter and Arsenal all keen.

What’s his preference?

He has been quoted as saying that his favourite teams in Europe are Madrid and Barcelona. But that answer may well differ according to who is asking. He has also said the European-based player he models himself on is Yaya Toure.

Does he get forward as well as Toure?

He only scored three times last season for his club but he did score in the Under 20 Toulon tournament for Brazil against England last May. Brazil went on to beat France in the final and he was one of the stand-out performers. He is not as attacking a player as Toure but he doesn’t just sit; he brings the ball out from the back.

Has he played for Brazil yet?

He has moved up to the Under 23s and will step up to the senior team soon without doubt. He will definitely be part of the Olympic team at Rio 2016.

He’s not the finished product though?

Not by any means. Cruzeiro’s previous coach Celso Roth wanted to loan him out for experience and it was only when Marcelo Oliveira took over as manager that he became first choice.

So another project for Arsenal if Wenger lands him then?

Real Madrid seem pretty convinced they have him but who knows? It’s a long road to the first team at the Santiago Bernabeu. Arsene Wenger would certainly be able to offer him first team football sooner so that may persuade him to turn his back on Madrid and move to London.
