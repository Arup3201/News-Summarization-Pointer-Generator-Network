Her feisty passion helped make Poldark one of the biggest TV phenomena of the 1970s, changing the face of period drama for ever and making sex symbols of its stars.

But while the beautiful and headstrong leading lady Demelza won over millions of fans, one man was furious with the depiction: Poldark's original creator Winston Graham.

The author was 'livid' with the way the BBC portrayed the impulsive servant from his series of historical novels as promiscuous, and wanted the show pulled from the screens.

Demelza was memorably played by flame-haired Angharad Rees.

Graham's daughter Rosamund Barteau made the revelation to The Mail on Sunday, as a much-anticipated remake starts tonight.

'Father blew a gasket when he saw the first episode of the original series,' she says.

'He was so angry about the way they had changed Demelza into a floozy that he wanted to get the production halted.

'He was absolutely livid. In the novel she was a spirited tomboy, but the producers had some salacious need to make her sexually loose.

'In one scene she even offered to pull down her knickers for a shilling. That certainly was not in the books. 

'Father, fearing the other episodes would be more like a bad romance novel, tried everything he could to stop the show from airing. But he did not have any editorial control.

'It was not until the second series that he was able to have any input.'

But Graham came to embrace the show, which was a runaway success on both sides of the Atlantic.

Rosamund – who now lives in Idaho after marrying an American – cannot remember a time when Poldark was not a part of her life.

'As a child I knew it was important not to play too loudly, when dad was locked in his study,' she recalls. 'We lived in a lovely Cornish village and at those times I usually took myself off to my friend's house.

'Father woke up early, went into his study and wrote something every day. And every afternoon would have tea with my mother for an hour, when he would bounce ideas at her.'

'Father was the author, but she helped with some of the details because she was very observant. 

'She saw everything and remembered it all. She had an eye for detail and could help my father with his writing. She had the most amazing sense of humour, too.

Rosamund Barteau is keeping her father's creation alive – by running a Poldark-themed guesthouse in Idaho.

The bedrooms, arranged around a central swimming pool, are named after the story's four main characters.

'Americans love themed vacations, and Poldark was a hit on US TV and sold well on video,' she says. 'It has a good following in the States.' 

'I was in my late teens when I was old enough to read my father's novels. I am very pleased that they have stood the test of time and a new generation will be able to enjoy the series – and the books.'

The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis. 

He returns from the American War of Independence to find his father dead, his house wrecked and his sweetheart engaged. His romance with Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is again at the heart of the series.

'I've seen the first episode with Aidan and I could sit and watch it again and again,' says Rosamund.

'I think my dad would be very proud of what the BBC have done. Eleanor's Demelza is wonderful and her Cornish accent is good. It isn't too strong but enough to know where she is supposed to be from.'
