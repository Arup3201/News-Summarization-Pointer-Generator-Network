Barcelona defender Gerard Pique took to Facebook to answer questions ranging from who his childhood idols were to the toughest opponents he has ever faced on the pitch.

With his team leading La Liga and on the verge of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Manchester City, Pique took time away from training to interact with his fans.

When asked who were the best defenders he has played alongside, the 28-year-old listed a pair of stalwarts from the two clubs he has signed for during his career: Carles Puyol at Barcelona and Rio Ferdinand of Manchester United.

Pique arrived at Manchester United from Barcelona's La Masia academy as a teenager in 2004 before returning to Barcelona four years later when opportunities at Old Trafford became limited, primarily because of the established form of Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic.

The Spaniard, who has a child with pop songstress Shakira, bears a similar cultured style to Ferdinand in the mould of a tall defender with excellent technique who is comfortable on the ball.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, Pique again chose one player from England and another from Spain when asked who have been his toughest opponents.

'Cristiano Roanldo and Didier Drogba,' he answered in reference to his Real Madrid rival and and Chelsea's physically imposing centre-forward.

Among other revelations from Pique's Q&A session are that Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman were his idols as a child while, unsurprisingly, Lionel Messi is 'definitely' the best player he has ever played with.

Pique also admitted he misses the presence of Puyol and close friend Cesc Fabregas in the Nou Camp dressing room, saying:  'Yes, a loooooot! Who wouldn't?'
