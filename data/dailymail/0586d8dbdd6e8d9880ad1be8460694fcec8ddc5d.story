Vladimir Putin blasted the West today over Ukraine after angering the German chancellor by turning up late for a summit in Milan with world leaders.  

Angela Merkel cancelled a session with the Kremlin strongman last night after Putin was delayed arriving at the talks, which include David Cameron.

Putin had travelled from Belgrade where he was given a hero's welcome.

A tense late night two and a half hour bilateral between Russian-speaking Merkel and German-speaking Putin was eventually rescheduled after a welcome dinner at the two-day ASEM summit of European and Asian leaders.

Putin's spokesman made clear there was little progress with Russia and the West sharply divided over solutions to the Ukraine crisis, which has cost more than 3,600 lives in six months.

Dmitry Peskov said: 'There are still serious differences concerning the origin of Ukraine's internal conflict, as well as the root causes of what is currently happening.'

Mr Peskov said some Western leaders displayed 'incomprehension' over Ukraine and refused to accept 'reality'. 

He said: 'Unfortunately, some participants at breakfast demonstrated complete unwillingness to understand the reality in southeastern Ukraine.

'Indeed the talks are difficult, there are plenty of disagreements, plenty of incomprehension.

Putin shakes hands with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko before the talks began

'But at the same time they are going on, there is an exchange of opinion.'  

Merkel contends that Russia is holding back peace by failing in a promise to pull out its troops.

A ceasefire agreement thrashed out last month in Minsk was 'first and foremost' Russia's responsibility to implement, she told the Russian leader.

Putin was today meeting Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko over the crisis and said 'peace and stability in Ukraine, it is the only thing we expect'.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov assured Czech leaders that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine, said Czech president Milos Zeman.

It was the first time Cameron has met Putin since Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the skies above Ukraine, in an act the West blames on rebel fighters backed by Moscow.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte admitted he had an 'emotional' confrontation with Putin over the tragedy.

All 298 passengers on board were killed - 153 of them from the Netherlands.

Rutte said: 'I have just spoken to President Putin in Milan and demanded maximum cooperation in resolving the MH17 disaster.

'It is an emotional subject and of course I am angry at all parties who have made it impossible to start work in at the crash site.

'But it's now up to us to reach our goal. I'll use every opportunity to highlight the issue.'

A mass funeral was held in Ukraine yesterday for 21 unidentified soldiers killed during the conflict 

On Monday four Dutch experts returned to the crash site in pro-Moscow rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, but Dutch officials, including Rutte, have lamented the lack of proper access to the wreck site.

Dutch forensic experts called off their search of the area in early August because of the ongoing fighting between Kiev and pro-Russian separatists.

The summit was also on edge over a Putin threat to cut gas supplies to the EU if energy-starved Ukraine is found to siphon off supplies from a pipeline transiting its territory.

'There are major transit risks,' Putin said ahead of the meeting. 

Meanwhile, a mass funeral was held in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, yesterday for 21 unidentified soldiers killed during the conflict. 

After a brief service the deceased were taken out of town and buried in lines next to one another.
