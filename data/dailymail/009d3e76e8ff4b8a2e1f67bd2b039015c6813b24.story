Scientists have revealed that Earth came perilously close to a solar storm that could have 'changed life as we know it', causing widespread power failures and knocking out GPS and communication networks.

On July 23, 2012, a plasma cloud or 'CME' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km/s, more than four times faster than a typical eruption.

Had the eruption occurred just one week earlier, the blast site would have been facing Earth, rather than off to the side.

The storm that could have changed life as we know it: On July 23, 2012, a plasma cloud or 'CME' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km/s, more than four times faster than a typical eruption.

According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, the total economic impact could exceed $2 trillion or 20 times greater than the costs of a Hurricane Katrina.

Multi-ton transformers fried by such a storm could take years to repair and impact national security.

Analysts believe that a direct hit could cause widespread power blackouts, disabling everything that plugs into a wall socket. 

Most people wouldn’t even be able to flush their toilet because urban water supplies largely rely on electric pumps, one report warned.

Solar flares can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere creating disruptions with signal transmission from, for example, a GPS satellite to Earth.

Another phenomenon produced by the sun could be even more disruptive.

Known as a coronal mass ejection or CME these solar explosions propel bursts of particles into Earth's atmosphere.

Those fluctuations could induce electric fluctuations at ground level that could blow out transformers in power grids.

A CME's particles can also collide with crucial electronics onboard a satellite and disrupt its systems.

Scientists say the eruption may have been the most violent ever recorded.

'If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,' says Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado, who presented a talk entitled The Major Solar Eruptive Event in July 2012: Defining Extreme Space Weather Scenarios at the NOAA's Space Weather Workshop - an annual gathering to discuss the perils and probabilities of solar storms.

'We need to be prepared,' said Baker.

A recent paper in Nature Communications authored by UC Berkeley space physicist Janet G. Luhmann and former postdoc Ying D. Liu uncovered what gave the storm its potency.

For one thing, the CME was actually two CMEs separated by only 10 to 15 minutes.

This double storm cloud traveled through a region of space that had been cleared out by another CME only four days earlier.

As a result, the CMEs were not decelerated as much as usual by their transit through the interplanetary medium.

On July 23, 2012, a plasma cloud or 'CME' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km/s, more than four times faster than a typical eruption.

The storm tore through Earth orbit, but fortunately Earth wasn't there.

Instead it hit the STEREO-A spacecraft.

Researchers have been analyzing the data ever since, and they have concluded that the storm was one of the strongest in recorded history.

'It might have been stronger than the Carrington Event itself,' says Baker.

The Carrington Event of Sept. 1859 was a series of powerful CMEs that hit Earth head-on, sparking Northern Lights as far south as Tahiti.

Intense geomagnetic storms caused global telegraph lines to spark, setting fire to some telegraph offices and disabling the 'Victorian Internet."

A similar storm today could have a catastrophic effect on modern power grids and telecommunication networks.

According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, the total economic impact could exceed $2 trillion or 20 times greater than the costs of a Hurricane Katrina.

When the Carrington Event enveloped Earth in the 19th century, technologies of the day were hardly sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. 

Modern society, on the other hand, is deeply dependent on sun-sensitive technologies such as GPS, satellite communications and the internet.

'The effect of such a storm on our modern technologies would be tremendous,' says Luhmann.

During informal discussions at the workshop, Nat Gopalswamy of the Goddard Space Flight Center noted that 'without NASA's STEREO probes, we might never have known the severity of the 2012 superstorm. 

'This shows the value of having 'space weather buoys' located all around the sun.'

It also highlights the potency of the sun even during so-called 'quiet times.'

Many observers have noted that the current solar cycle is weak, perhaps the weakest in 100 years. Clearly, even a weak solar cycle can produce a very strong storm.
