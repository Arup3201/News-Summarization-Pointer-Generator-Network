Cybernetic arms, unicorns, cupcakes and women turning into huge spiders are but a few of Killer Is Dead's quirky delights.

But this is no surprise given that it's developed by Goichi Suda, popularly known as Suda51- the outlandish mind behind the acclaimed No More Heroes and Killer7.

But to say Killer Is Dead is in the same league would be inaccurate - due to some missteps in the gameplay and graphics departments.

Not a sight for sore eyes: There is something impressive about the style, but the colour scheme is way off

You play Mondo, a pencil-thin assassin and womaniser who wakes up to find he has a cybernetic arm (as you do). Mondo and his annoying assistant Mika then join the Bryan Execution Firm - where a lady called Eva sends him on missions to destroy monsters and a muscled man called Bryan smokes cigars.

Then there's the gameplay, which plays in a similar way to Devil May Cry. You're encouraged to mix light and heavy attacks, and can use your cybernetic arm to fire different types of ammunition - ranging from bullets to a freeze ray.

Sadly, it's incredibly repetitive and extremely easy - and although you can accumulate enough 'blood' to unleash a devastating execution move - the limited repertoire of finishers grates by the end of the game. Mondo's inability to jump, too, is a bizarre decision especially given the multi-layered level design.

Visually the game is incredibly inconsistent. The colour pallet really isn't for everyone's tastes - and while environments are varied - ranging from an oversized candy house to the Moon - the colour choice looks deeply unpleasant at times.

Fans of Suda51 may find the dialogue amusing, the main vehicle for humour being Mika. But for most, she will soon become incredibly tiresome - an annoyance who's so desperate for attention that it ultimately takes away from what little narrative there is.

In-game and texture quality has been sacrificed to keep the framerate smooth - and to its credit,  there's almost no slowdown even during the game's more demanding boss sections.

Where Killer Is Dead claws back a points is away from the action. There are inventive mini games where you have to impress women one minute or run over as many enemies with a motorbike as possible the next.

There are also moments during the 
cinematics that are beautifully directed. A shot where Mondo is running 
across the surface of the Moon is particularly memorable. As is an early
 scene involving Bryan and a killer you execute.

Bland: There are some memorable moments away from the campaign, such as trying to help Mondo woo women, but the bread and butter gameplay isn't as challenging as it should be and soon gets repetitive

Alas, for the most part, Killer Is Dead is forgettable. And although hardcore Suda51 fans may find some solace here, it will be too obscure for many.

Killer Is Dead is out on Friday August 30.
