David Waygood was the sole director of a British-based company allegedly used by footballer Messi

A British banker who killed himself by stepping out in front of a train ran a company which allegedly helped footballer Lionel Messi dodge tax, it has emerged.

David Waygood, who died last year aged 62, was the sole director of a firm which Spanish prosecutors claim hid tax owed by Messi.

Earlier this week, a judge in Barcelona ruled that Messi, 27, and his father Jorge should be charged with tax evasion after prosecutors claimed the pair hid more than £3million in shell firms in the UK, Switzerland, Uruguay and Belize.

One of the British firms  was looked after at the time by Mr Waygood, a banker who had previously worked for HSBC and NatWest.

The Spanish prosecution alleged that the company held shares anonymously in a British-based nominee company.

Rosie Sharp, from campaigner Global Witness, told The Mirror that nominees ‘own or control the company on behalf of someone else through hidden arrangements’.

Mr Waygood committed suicide in April last year by standing in front of a train at a railway crossing in Otford, Kent. He had left a note for his children James and Lizzie which blamed stress.

At an inquest into his death in October, a coroner returned a verdict of suicide. 

Messi and his father were accused last year of defrauding the Spanish state of £3.3million by filing false returns for the years 2006 to 2009. They have denied any wrongdoing.

The Spanish court will now push ahead with the process of prosecuting the Argentina and Barcelona forward for the alleged tax evasion despite a recommendation from the public prosecutor that the charges be dismissed.

The prosecutor argued in June that it was Messi’s father Jorge who was responsible for the family’s finances and not the four-time World Player of the Year.

However, the court decided that Lionel could have known about and approved the creation of the shell companies which were allegedly used to evade the taxes due on income from image rights.

As one of the world’s highest-paid athletes, Messi earns just over £31million a season in salary and bonuses, according to Forbes magazine, as well as about £18million from sponsors.

The magazine has him as the fourth top-earning athlete behind boxer Floyd Mayweather, Real Madrid footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and basketball player LeBron James.
