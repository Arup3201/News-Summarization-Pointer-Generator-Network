Jimmy Fallon hosted the Christmas episode of Saturday Night Live for the second time last night, joined by his personal friend and rapping buddy Justin Timberlake as musical guest.

The Christmas special is usually the most star-studded episode of the year and 2013 was no exception with Paul McCartney, Barry Gibb and Madonna all making surprise appearances.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also stopped by the show during his last week in office.

Bloomberg said he was looking forward to relaxing at the end of the year when Bill de Blasio takes over.

'I'll be fulfilling a lifelong dream of consuming a small soda on a smoke-free beach,' he said, poking fun at two of his health initiatives

While his ban on large soda drinks was ultimately unsuccessful, Bloomberg recently passed a law which bans electronic cigarettes in the public spaces of restaurants, offices and beaches. He was also able to squeeze in another ban on Styrofoam cups and trays.

As usual Bloomberg was questioned about a possible presidential run in 2016, and he joked that was one of the many options he was considering along with ‘naked cowboy’.

Post-mayor plans: Bloomberg said he looked forward to enjoying a small can of soda on a non-smoking beach once he left office

Bloomberg, who has no job lined up after the mayorship, said he has applied to teach Spanish at a few universities but was told his accent ‘isn’t quite bueno ‘.

Later in weekend update, Seth Meyers covered the story of tennis champion Billie Jean King being named by President Obama the recent story of Billie Jean King being named appointed by President Obama to lead the U.S. envoy at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.

Many have considered the move a jab at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent ban on ‘gay propaganda’.

In the skit, Meyers interviews Kate McKinnon as a flambouyant King, who calls herself President Obama’s ‘big gay middle finger’ that’s ‘about to get flipped’.

King says she’s going to drive her Subaru Outback into Moscow’s Red Square, doing donuts and blasting Melissa Etheridge. 

Meyers asks if she’s afraid of getting in trouble, since homosexuality has been suppressed under Putin.

‘Get in trouble, I’m from trouble,’ King says, adding that as a 70-year-old lesbian, she only needs a clean canteen and a sweater to survive and she can summon rescued pit bulls. 

King goes on to mock many of the Winter Olympic sports as inherently homosexual like ice dancing, the biathlon and two-man luge.

While the rest of the skits focused on Christmas or Fallon’s many-varried celebrity impressions, one other skit touched on political commentary. 

Fallon teamed up with Timberlake to reprise one of their popular past sketches, The Barry Gibb Talk show.

Fallon plays The BeeGee's easily-angered frontman who hosts a 'no nonsense' political talk show with his silent brother Robin.

Their guests this week were Fox anchor Megyn Kelly, played by Cecily Strong, Republican congressman Paul Ryan, played by Taran Killam, and Madonna as herself.

The topic of the show was the recent bi-partisan budget deal passed last week which made certain that the government will not shut down again in the next two years.

Kelly was the first to state her opinion on the matter, but accidentally made the mistake of speaking over Barry, causing him to jump out of his seat and threaten to 'take a selfie with your skeleton' and post it on Instagram.

After colling down, Gibb asks Madonna to shed her opinion on the subject of bi-partisan, and she gives an eloquent statement about putting personal ideologies aside for the greater good.

In a rare change of charcter, Gibb agrees, saying Madonna makes a great point.

But when Madonna continues to talk, Gibb breaks again saying 'You already answered the question woman'.

Barry is about to go into a fully blown rage when Madonna puts in a grill and stares deep into his eyes.

Barry calms down, saying Madonna has tamed him like a wild horse.

He moves onto Paul Ryan next who offends Barry with a play on words involving the BeeGee brothers names.

'We're not "Robin" from the taxpayers to "Gibb" to special interests.,' he said about the bi-partisan deal.

'Did you make a pun on my show?' Barry yells before kicking his legs into the air.

He asks Ryan is he thinks he's one of the Wiggles.

'I wasn't born on the Isle of Boy, I was born on the Isle of Man!' as he kicks over a vase of flowers and hands one of the petals to Kelly.

As time runs out, Timberlake and Fallon wrap up the skit with an exit song and are joined by real-life Barry Gibb.
