Since they seem to spend more than half the year on holiday and enjoy a four-day week, it is remarkable how much time MPs have to waste online.

Figures show they and their staff spend thousands of hours a year on Facebook, online games and betting sites.

Records show computers on the Parliamentary estate access Facebook up to three million times a month – 400 times as often as the BBC News website.

Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s shocking so much Parliamentary staff time is being wasted surfing websites that clearly have nothing to do with their jobs.

'Taxpayers expect MPs, assisted by their staff, to be spending their 
time representing constituents and scrutinising the Government, not 
playing online games.

‘It’s important that this information is in the public domain so that 
taxpayers can see exactly how the time they are paying for is actually 
being spent.’

The figures also reveal an extraordinary number of visits to supermarket shopping websites and computer gaming sites and the controversial music downloading site Grooveshark, which is being sued by records labels for alleged copyright offences.

Separate figures reveal that MPs and their staff made more than 2,000 calls to the speaking clock last year - despite working within earshot of Big Ben.

Around 200 of these 
are thought to be accounted for by engineers checking the time when 
winding the Big Ben clock three times a week.

The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, list the most visited websites for the 5,000 Parliamentary computers.

In March last year there were more than 83,000 visits to Betfair’s horseracing form guide, and 5,461 to a Betfair sports betting site.

Facebook was the most popular website by far and received more than three million visits some months

There were 4,665 visits to rival Paddy Power, 3,803 to Ladbrokes and 4,126 to news site attheraces.com.

Fantasy game Fairyland saw up to 25,000 visits a month, while World of Solitaire had up to 10,000 visits a month.

Some
MPs appear to visit their own websites repeatedly, with Tory 
backbencher Christopher Pincher’s site getting 23,000 visits in 
September, fellow Tory Rebecca Harris having almost 8,000 in a month, 
and Lib Dem MP John Hemming 9,000.

But most popular by far was social network Facebook, with more than three million visits in some months.

As Parliament normally sits for four days a week when not in recess, this equates to 35 visits per working day from every computer.

By contrast, many mainstream news sites received few visits. The BBC 
website’s news section and the website of ITN both struggled to get more
than 7,000 visits a month.

The revelations are the latest in a series of embarrassing stories about Internet use on the Parliamentary estate.
Last year it was reported that users were making thousands of visits to 
the site SexyMP, which asks people to rate the attractiveness of 
different MPs.

A Parliamentary spokesman said the figures might be unreliable as some sites, such as Facebook, automatically refresh.
