Police officers who were chasing two illegal immigrants near the US-Mexico border were stunned when they stumbled across a marijuana farm spread across two acres of prime land.

The officers had been pursuing the illegal immigrants about 15 miles southwest of Raymondville in Texas.

But they got much more than they bargained for when they stumbled across a farm with rows of 8-foot tall marijuana plants just 25 miles from the US-Mexico border on the Texas side.

Willacy County Sheriff Larry Spence said: 'I haven't seen anything like this. I've seen where guys would hollow out a place in the brush in their backyard or something close to their house, just a little bit.

'But this was quite spread out and dense and most of them were already pretty high.'

The farm had once been used to grow watermelons and grain.

The farm was well tended too and had white pipes and a pump diverting water from a canal which delivered to the 60-foot long rows by carefully excavated trenches.

Mark Dawson, Homeland Security Investigations deputy special agent in charge of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley, was shocked by the quality of the irrigation system.

He said he hadn't encountered something like this in his 17 years in the area.

Mr Dawson said: 'I guess we shouldn't be surprised by how well it was done 
considering it's the Rio Grande Valley and people down there are very 
experienced in irrigation and just growing (fruits and vegetables) in 
general.'

Every year, tons of marijuana crosses the border daily from Mexico and large-scale growing operations are routinely found.

Last month, authorities dismantled a massive pot farm in the woods about 70 miles northeast of Houston that yielded 100,000 plants.

But such a large crop so close to the border is unheard of, according to authorities.

The 11,500-plant farm was located nearly a mile from a paved road, on an
 old dairy farm long left to its own devices.

A well-kept citrus grove sat across the dirt
 road, and horses browsed in a pasture nearby.

The
 marijuana was on the back portion of the overgrown parcel and authorities 
had to plow a road in just to access it.

Adjacent to the field of pot were 
small shelters which were carefully camouflaged with branches.

Officers found an empty case of instant noodles, scattered egg shells 
and a 50-pound bag of fertilizer in them.

Nearby, a large black plastic tarp 
could be unfurled for shade - most likely for the immigrant pot farm workers.

According to police, the
 crop's owners would have soon brought in another valuable harvest of a 
dozen immigrants if they weren't rumbled by officers who ran straight into the pot farm on August 13.

The
 night before, a man dialed 911 and claimed that he had been held,
 beaten and threatened in a stash house for three weeks.

He tried to 
lead sheriff's deputies back to the spot, but couldn't find it in the 
dark.

Authorities returned 
in the daylight and found more than they bargained for when they pursued
 the immigrants down twisting paths.

According to police, the man and other immigrants were likely forced to care for 
the marijuana plants, as three weeks is an unusually long time to be 
held in a stash house.

Three men were arrested on immigrant harboring 
charges, but prosecutors dropped cases against two of them earlier this week and 
the third waived his preliminary hearing in federal court.

Miracle grow: An empty fertilizer bag is left behind at the two-acre pot farm

No one has been charged yet in the pot growing operation.

But an investigation is underway by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

However, it is still too early to know why the location was selected.

Local farmer Javier
 Davila of Edinburg has his own theory.

He said that the owners of the pot farm probably used that piece of land because they had more security on the border.

He believes that they grew the weed close to the border to able to cross over with it.

Mr Davila had not farmed that parcel of his family's land since
 1996.

He has another 40 acres next door and has told Border Patrol 
before that he suspected immigrants were passing through the land 
because he found water bottles, food cans and backpacks.

Last
 year, the Texas Domestic Cannabis Program, in which local and federal 
law enforcement agencies participate, eradicated 147,277 outdoor 
cultivated plants in 24 separate seizures.
