Reality TV star Kim Kardashian has sparked anger in the Middle East as she touches down in the region for a store launch and publicity tour.

Kardashian, the curvy beauty who shot to prominence after an infamous sex tape of her emerged in 2007, is in Kuwait and will also visit Bahrain to launch a pair of Millions of Milkshakes franchises in malls.

But the deeply conservative and religious nations may not offer her a warm welcome because of controversies surrounding the x-rated video, her short-lived marriage to NBA star Kris Humphries and a recent furore over her tweets supporting the people of Israel during the recent conflict with Palestine.

Controversy: Kim Kardashian posed as she arrived in Kuwait today and will visit Bahrain this weekend. However, many in the conservative Gulf nations are angry at the controversial star's presence

'Her values clash with our traditions as a religiously committed people,' Mohammad Al Tabtabai, a Kuwaiti preacher, told the Gulf News. 'Her visit could help spread vice among our youth.'

In neighbouring Bahrain, conservative lawmakers blasted the reality TV star and tried to keep her out of the island nation, arguing that she is 'an actress with an extremely bad reputation'.

However, their attempt fizzled out after they could not get the support they needed from their peers and the proposal did not even get to the voting stage.

Sahar Moussa, a columnist for The Kuwait Times, was angry that a number of musicians and other artists have been denied entry on moral and religious concerns by the country's Islamist Party, but Kardashian is allowed to visit.

She said: 'Let me be clear here, I really hate judging people, and I do respect everybody’s business when it comes to their private life, but when it is someone like Kim Kardashian - who is only known for her obscene movie, voluptuous derriere and fake reality TV show that shows nothing but low morals and a lot of plastic surgery - then I have a problem.

'I will not forgive them for letting a person who has nothing except low morals and fake attitude to come to Kuwait and spread what message?'

There is also some anger about the high prices of tickets to see her during her visit to Manama, Bahrain's capital. Tickets to see her in person can cost as much as 500 Bahraini dinar (more than £800), more than many Bahrainis earn in a month.

Apology: Kardashian's message to fans after she tweeted her support for the people of Israel during the recent conflict with Palestine

University student Mahmood Zeyad told the Gulf Daily News: 'I am annoyed by the thought that our society can be this shallow because Kim is coming to Bahrain.

'It proves that there are some of us who would pay that much for nothing, in comparison with what that money could bring.

'A total of BD500 can save lives,' he added.

However the celeb, who is currently dating rapper Kanye West, tweeted: 'It’s my first trip to Kuwait, so I can’t wait to see your beautiful city and meet everyone at The Avenues for Millions of Milkshakes on November 29.'

For her Bahraini fans she posted a video, where she said: 'Fans in the Kingdom of Bahrain, it's Kim Kardashian and I am so excited to see your beautiful city.

'I have never been to the Kingdom of Bahrain before and I just can't wait to meet you all when I come for Millions of Milkshakes. I'm so excited.'

Divorce: The TV personality filed for divorce from basketball star Kris Humphries after 72 days of marriage

Though Kardashian's trip centres around the promotional appearance, she previously said that she hoped to meet with local leaders to learn political tensions in the Middle East.

The move is likely a damage limitation PR exercise following a Twitter controversy after she tweeted she was 'praying for everyone in Israel' during the recent bombing campaign.

After a barrage of furious responses, including death threats, she then posted: 'Praying for everyone in Palestine and across the world.'

As part of this pledge she met with Matthew Tueller, the United States ambassador to Kuwait.

Kardashian filed for divorce more than a year ago, citing irreconcilable differences, just weeks after the couple's glamorous and televised wedding.

Humphries, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, later filed for an annulment, claiming the marriage was based on fraud but he has yet to lay out any specific evidence for his claim.
