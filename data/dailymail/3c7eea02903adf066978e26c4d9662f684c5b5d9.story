Two major banks are to let their customers access their accounts on their iPhones using Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanning technology.

Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest said that customers will no longer need to remember complicated login information to see their finances.

It is the first time a major bank has enabled the fingerprint recognition technology in place of passwords and passcodes on a mobile phone application.

Around 880,000 RBS and NatWest customers are expected to be able to use the feature, which is only available on iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 devices.

Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger.

Users can 'train' their iPhone to 
read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home 
button, the phone is unlocked.

Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books.

It uses a 'laser cut sapphire 
crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7
 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not.

All fingerprint information is 
encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip.

The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud.

However some experts have warned that as more of our data is protected by the Touch ID  

RBS said that it hoped the technology would make it easier and more convenient for customers to access their finances.

Stuart Haire, managing director of RBS and NatWest Direct Bank, said: 'There has been a revolution in banking, as more and more of our customers are using digital technology to bank with us.

'Adding Touch ID to our mobile banking app makes it even easier and more convenient for customers to manage their finances on the move.'

While the banks are the first to make use of Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanning technology, they are not the first to use such biometric scanning.

Barclay's Bank announced last year that it is to introduce 'finger-vein' readers to allow their customers to get rid of their pin numbers.

The scanners take an infra-red scan of the unique vein pattern that lies just below the skin. 

Barclays said that it was rolling out the devices to its 30,000 corporate customers this year and if successful it would be extended to its other customers.

Apple's Touch ID uses a sensor to scan the fingerprint of users that it then matches to one stored in its software.

Some iPhone Apps already use Touch ID for making purchases, including Apple's own iTunes store and Amazon's app.

RBS and NatWest say 50 per cent of their 15 million customers now use online banking, with three million using their mobile app.

The banks estimate that 1.8 million of those use iPhones, on average 40 times per month.

However, not all models of the iPhone have Touch ID, with older devices and the iPhone 5C not featuring the hardware.

Those with the right technology will have to activate the feature with their usual security information but would then only need to use Apple's Touch ID from then on.

It took just two days and a small collection of everyday household items for a group of German hackers to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an Apple iPhone 5S.

The group, calling themselves the Chaos Computer Club, took a high-resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass using 2400 dpi resolution.

The image was then cleaned up using photo-editing software before being inverted.

They then laser printed it onto a transparent sheet with 1200 dpi resolution using a thick toner setting.

The hackers then poured pink latex milk or white woodglue into the print pattern created by the toner onto the transparent sheet.

After
 it dried, the thin latex sheet is lifted from the sheet, breathed on 
'to make it a tiny bit moist' and pressed onto the sensor to unlock the 
phone. 

Apple said the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle

After three failed login attempts with Touch ID, however, customers would have to re-enter their passcodes.

Last year RBS said that it would invest £1 billion over the next three years to make it easier for customers to bank when they are on the move.

Simon Cadbury, head of strategy and innovation at digital banking consultants Intelligent Environments, said that biometric security like fingerprint scanning had the potential to make banking services safer to use by reducing the risk of phishing attacks and identity fraud.

He said: 'The key benefit of biometric security is that they don’t only make services more secure, but also easier to use. 

'Our research shows that eight in ten people are ready to ditch their passwords in favour of biometric security measures.

'The popularity of mobile devices like the best-selling iPhone 6 has finally helped move biometric technology into the mainstream. 

'This will provide banking customers with the convenience of not having to remember multiple log ins that are entered manually whilst also reducing the potential for phishing attacks and identity fraud.'

However, the introduction of Touch ID will raise some concerns among security experts. 

German hacker Jan Krissler claimed that he had managed to use photographs of German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen's hand to recreate her fingerprints.

Others have shown that it is possible to unlock Touch ID secured phones by lifting fingerprints from glass or the device's screen.

Ben Schlabs, of SRLabs, a German hacking think tank, told the BBC: 'Just the fact that you are carrying the key around with you and leave copies of it exposed everywhere you go makes it a very different risk to something that is inside your brain. The risks are poorly understood.' 

Phil Underwood, global head of pre-sales at security experts SecurEnvoy, said: 'There is always a balancing act when it comes to authentication. Make it too easy for the user and the authentication may be compromised or circumvented, too hard and adoption rates for the new authentication technology will drop.

'One of the main drivers of this authentication technology taking hold, is that the current generation’s device of choice is now firmly the smartphone, with there now being over 1.75 billion devices in use worldwide and this is ever growing.

'With the advent of reliable fingerprint readers on the latest smartphones, the second "something the user knows" component is switched from a potentially easy-to-break password to a physical one that is unique.'
