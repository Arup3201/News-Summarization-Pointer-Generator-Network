A New Jersey teen is lucky to be alive after finding himself stuck high on a zip line and then letting go, only to break both his legs on the hard ground 30 feet below.

The unnamed Hawthorne 15-year-old was trespassing on the property of an adjoining school district when, in lieu of the proper equipment, he decided to maneuver the high wire with a t-shirt as a harness.

It was immediately clear that the t-shirt wouldn't work when it left him stuck three stories up. 

Bad idea: A New Jersey 15-year-old sneaked onto a school's zip line, used a shirt as a harness, then dropped 30 feet to the ground as his friends goaded him on from below

That's when his friends suggested he let go, promising they would catch him.

'I told him it wasn't safe, you should come down, but his friends kept encouraging him,' 12-year-old witness Chris McKeon told WABC. 'I don't think he was thinking what could happen.'

Grainy cell phone video taken of the harrowing moment shows the boy dangling, letting go, then crashing down hard into the the ground.

If there was any question, his friends did not catch him.

The boy required surgery over the weekend from a broken femur and two broken feet. 

He's expected to have a long recovery but will walk again. 

Long road to recovery: The boy was in a school district next door to his own when he made the perilous decision. He broke a femur and both feet in the process
