With summer in full swing, celebrities and the British public alike are baring more flesh as the temperature climbs. Hot pants are getting shorter and crop tops more skimpy as we dress to beat the heat.

Rihanna and Miley Cyrus may rock the look, but showing off your 'underbutt' - showing off too much buttock in
a pair of tiny shorts - doesn't find favour with everyone.

The underbutt may be this summer's biggest trend, but it's also just been voted one of the season's biggest 
fashion disasters in a new poll.

A
quarter of women aged 18 - 24 questioned admit to having shown a bit too much 
underbutt at one time or another, and now describe it as a 'faux pas.'

Cheeky: Rihanna (left) and Miley Cyrus (right) love to show off a bit of underbutt - but now the look has been voted one of the biggest fashion disasters of the summer

Also included in the top ten summer style crimes were visible panty lines, muffin tops and too much cleavage.

And, while London may
be one of the fashion capitals of the world, its experimental nature leads locals to commit more fashion felonies than any other region.

But, as Heikki Haldre, chief executive and 
co-founder at virtual fitting room provider Fits.me, who carried out the
survey, points out: 'Fashion is not responsible for fashion faux pas: 
the problem is that we all-too-frequently choose clothes that don’t fit 
our body size or shape.  

'Three-quarters of all the fashion 
mistakes that women make are actually related to how well their clothes 
fit, and two-thirds of men’s mistakes too.'

Of the women polled, 84 per cent admit to having committed a serious fashion faux pas.

And men are just as guilty: a quarter of men under-35 have yanked their trousers too high, the outfit offence made infamous by Simon Cowell.

Britons abroad are well-known for 
their taste transgressions, and it seems summer brings out the 
exhibitionist in us: one in 10 women have worn bikinis that are too 
small, while a third admit to wearing skirts that are too short. 

One in five 35 - 55 year old men admit to channeling their inner Tom 
Daley by wearing tiny swimming trunks.

Haldre thinks there could be a simple explanation for all this: '36 per cent of shoppers recently told us that they use in-store fitting rooms less than they did just three years ago.' 

Male mistakes: A quarter of men have admitted to wearing their trousers too high like Simon Cowell (left) and one in five love tiny Speedos like Tom Daley (right) - both voted top fashion crimes 

'We’re also a self-conscious nation, with 18 per cent of consumers saying they dislike leaving their cubicle in order to see themselves in a public, full-length mirror. 

'And we are buying more clothes online where it’s often not even possible to "try before you buy".

'Perhaps retailers need to put more effort, online and offline, into making the trying-on of clothes a pleasurable part of the shopping experience again?'

Hmm. Are we too shy and retiring to look in the mirror at home, too? Or maybe the flesh-flashing girls and the boys bursting out of their budgie smugglers know exactly what they look like - and don't really care what anyone else thinks.
