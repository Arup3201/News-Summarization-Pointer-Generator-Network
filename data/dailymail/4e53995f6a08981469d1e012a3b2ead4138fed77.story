The battle over national health care is costing President Obama in the polls as he now has his lowest approval rating of his presidency.

A new poll put out by NBC and the Wall Street Journal reveals that only 42 per cent of the country approves of the President's job performance.

That approval rating is five points lower than it was earlier this month in the heat of the government shutdown following the budget battle.

Showing that the federal problems are overflowing into uncharted territory, the new poll reveals that the President's personal approval ratings have flipped from their normal stance- where more Americans like him as a person than those who dislike him. Now 41 per cent of respondents view him favorably and 45 per cent see him in a negative light.

Feeling the heat: President Obama's approval rating dropped to its lowest-ever point of 22 per cent while 51 per cent of Americans disapprove of his job performance (which is tied for his highest score ever)

Still got some fans: President Obama signs Cathey Park's cast at an event in Boston on Wednesday

'Personally and politically, the public’s assessment is two thumbs down,' pollster Peter Hart told NBC.

President Obama: 22 per cent approves of his job performance, 51 per cent disapproves

- 41 per cent view him favorably and 45 per cent sees him in a negative light

Congress: 74 per cent think Congress is causing more problems than they are solving

Republicans: 22 per cent approve of their job performance and 53 per cent disapprove

The shutdown: 38 per cent blame Republicans, 23 per cent blame Democrats, and 36 per cent feel that both parties are equally responsible

The negative responses were not limited 
to the President, however, as the Republican party in general was met 
with an all-time-low of 22 per cent approval and 53 per cent 
disapproval.

Nearly three-quarters of the respondents said that Congress was causing more problems than solving them.

Just slightly more than one-fifth (22 per cent) of the country thinks we're headed in the right direction and half of all respondents think that another government shutdown is inevitable.

And finally, 63 per cent of respondents want to vote their Congressional representative out of office. That particular question has been regularly asked in polls over the past decade an the latest response is the highest ever.

President Obama's disapproval rating- which measures the portion of the country who actively believes that the President is doing a poor job- came in at 51 per cent.

Both in the hot seat: President Obama and the Democrats are not the only ones in trouble as the Republicans, headed by John Boehner, also reached their lowest approval rating

This is the second time that his unfavorables have reached that high since he took office in 2009.

Talk
of fallout from the 16-day government shutdown earlier this month was a
constant concern during the negotiations, and it seems that the fact 
that Democrats came out just slightly less-hated than Republicans has 
begun to fade.

More Americans- 38 per cent- blame Republicans for the shutdown as opposed to Democrats- who are seen as the cause by 23 per cent of respondents- but there is still a sizable group- 36 per cent- who think both were to blame.

Pollsters explained that there was no one single problem cited by respondents, but rather it is a result of numerous issues.

In addition to the ongoing health insurance roll out and postponed budget battles, longer-lasting controversies like the NSA spying and the handling of the chemical weapons attack in Syria.
