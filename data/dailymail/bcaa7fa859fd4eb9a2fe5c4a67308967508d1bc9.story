Kindles may be the popular way to read on the move, but the traditional book has given us cause to create some spectacular buildings to house collections.

And French photographer Franck Bohbot has decided to celebrate the humble book by travelling the world to capture the ethereal beauty of the most amazing libraries.

The Parisian photographer has embarked on the ongoing project, called House of Books, to capture some of the world's most beautiful bibliothèques.

'The series started in Paris, then Rome. I plan to photograph libraries in Europe, South America, Asia and North America,' he explains.

'This is about the places that we have learned and where the books stay for decade.'

Paying tributes to the architects, the light, the composition and the colours of these beautiful building interiors, Bohbot includes contemporary libraries, small rooms and entrances.

'This is a long project, and this is the beginning,' he says. 

Franck Bohbot, 34, began his career as a set photographer. In 2008, he began to focus on public spaces, urban landscapes and environmental portraits.

He is well known for his composition and colour, and immortalising every day scenes such as swimming pools, city streets, bars, museums, train stations and barbershops.

The Parisian hopes to document his discovery of the world's most iconic libraries on his website franckbohbot.com
