More than a million public service workers are poised to launch the ‘fight of their lives’ with a ‘sustained’ series of strikes to oppose cuts to their pensions.

The leader of Britain’s largest union yesterday issued a defiant ‘call to arms’ and urged members to prepare for a rolling programme of strikes over the autumn designed to ‘weaken’ the Coalition.

Dave Prentis, general secretary of public sector union Unison, said his members would co-ordinate action with 11 local government unions and 19 health unions.

Waging war: Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis issued a 'call to arms' to his one million members while speaking at the conference in Manchester today

Delegates at Unison’s annual 
conference in Manchester are today expected to vote for a strike ballot 
to be held across its 1.2million membership. It includes nurses and 
council staff such as dinner ladies and social workers.

Public sector pensions are far more generous than those for private sector workers.

The ‘autumn of discontent’ is being 
threatened over Coalition plans for public sector workers to pay more 
into their pension scheme and receive less on retirement.

Mr Prentis revealed that Unison had built up a £20million fighting fund for the action.

In a keynote speech at the 
conference, he said: ‘If this Government fails to heed our warnings, to 
negotiate in good faith, I say to David Cameron, “You ain’t seen nothing
yet.”

‘We will strike to defend our 
pensions: a campaign of strike action without precedent. Our 
preparations are well advanced, but there is more to do.’

He told delegates: ‘Strike action 
will need to be sustained. The fight of our lives may be an overused 
cliche, but that is what this is.’

Nick Clegg warned his Tory colleagues to stop ‘bristling for a fight’ with the unions.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he 
would stand in the way of anyone attempting to ‘turn the clock’ back to 
the 1980s and called for ‘negotiation not confrontation’.

Mr Prentis was confident that ordinary people would not turn 
their backs on the public sector, adding that many in the health service
and elsewhere were earning a ‘pittance’.

Support: Members vote on a motion during the annual Unison conference. They have been told to 'prepare for action' that could see a wave of strikes

Speaking at the Unison 
conference in Manchester, he said that the extra money being taken from 
workers was being used to pay for the deficit and would not go to their 
pension funds.

Unison president Angela Lynes also told the union's annual conference
that public sector workers were facing ‘unprecedented’ attacks on pay, 
jobs and pensions.

She told delegates at the conference in 
Manchester that workers were under ‘assault’ on a number of fronts, 
adding: ‘On pensions, the Government is determined to hit us with a 
triple whammy - they want us to pay more, work longer and then get less 
when we retire.’

Mrs Lynes, 41, who works for Glasgow City 
Council, said the economy was being ‘dragged back’ to recession and 
accused Chancellor George Osborne of refusing to accept the need for a 
Plan B, even though Plan A ‘wasn't working’.

'This is more sick society, than Big Society'

She
continued: ‘There is a refusal to learn from the pain experienced by 
our sisters and brothers in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, where 
austerity has simply driven the economy into ever-deeper crisis.

‘The effect is felt every day by real people. Unemployment is huge, homelessness is on the rise, and spiralling inflation has meant that the poorest are once again the hardest hit.

‘One of the ways the Government thinks it can save cash is by parcelling as many of our public services off to the private sector as possible.

‘This is despite the warnings we've had in recent weeks from the appalling conditions at the private hospital in Bristol, and from the fact that more than 30,000 elderly people face huge uncertainty about whether they will be turfed out on to the streets if Southern Cross goes bust.

‘But these failures have not been taken on board - quite the opposite. The Government now wants to do the same with the NHS in England and other key public services. This is more sick society than Big Society.’

Unison members working in local government have already taken industrial action in protest at cuts to jobs and services, and Mr Prentis has said 1.3million workers could be balloted for strikes later in the year to defend their pensions.

Mr Prentis today repeated his warning of strikes later in the year if there is no deal on pensions, saying that the action would be ‘indefinite’.

The defeat of the miners in their 1984 strike was a seminal event in industrial history and is credited with helping to hasten the decline of UK trade unions.

Like today’s public sector workers, Britain’s 300,000 miners back then were paid by the state, which owned the coal industry. It has since been privatised.

The dispute pitted Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher against equally resolute union leader Arthur Scargill, who she blamed for bringing down the previous Tory government.

Struggle: Mine union leader Arthur Scargill vowed to destroy the government of MrsThatcher, who, blamed him for bringing down the last Tory administration

In return, Scargill vowed to not only stop planned pit closures, but also ‘roll back the years of Thatcherism’ – which, like today, had seen a massive decline in public spending.

The miners represented Britain’s strongest union and so, when they downed tools in March 1984, the stage was set for a battle that would make or break either the Government or trade unionism.

Ultimately, the Government won for three reasons.

Firstly, it had anticipated a strike and secretly built up stockpiles of coal in the years since its election in 1979.

This meant the miners, despite being highly organised, were unable to disrupt industry in the same way as they had in 1974, when power shortages led to Edward Heath’s government introducing a three-day week.

Secondly, the miners failed to maintain public support. They received a raft of donations at the beginning.

Conflict: The strike pitted miners against thousands of police officers

But, by the end, as violence ensued and allegations of the strike being illegal intensified, people lost interest in backing the union’s members.

Thirdly, because the strike dragged on so long, the union ran out of cash and member were dragged into poverty.

The trickle of miners returning to work by the autumn had become a flood by the March 1985, when the strike was finally called off.

When Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis said his members ‘will not be starved back like the miners’, this scenario is what he means.

The union is therefore hopeful that it can maintain public support, have enough cash to bankroll industrial action and ensure that it has enough leverage against the Coalition Government to win.

If they lose, union bosses fear a new wave of privatisations and public sector reforms like those witnessed after the 1984 strike.
