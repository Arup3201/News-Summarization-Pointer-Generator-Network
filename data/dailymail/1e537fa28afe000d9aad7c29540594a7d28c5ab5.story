With 27,000 dogs packing themselves into a room for this year's Crufts show, it is rather difficult for our canine friends to make themselves stand out from the crowd.

But one canine is doing his utmost to be crowned the best in the land - readying himself for competition in a obscure gold, sequined snood to keep his precious floppy ears covered up.

American Cocker Spaniel Ricky's pre-show look, in which his primmed cream coat is tied up with purple clips, reveals how far owners will go to ensure their pet is the top dog in town.

Thousands of owners accompanied their animals today at the second day of this year's Crufts dog show at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre.

The Kennel Club estimates that around 
145,000 people will visit the four-day celebration of all things canine,
including contests to assess agility, heelwork and other disciplines.

Dog lovers from 41 countries, from as far afield as Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, will take part in the event.

A record 2,131 dogs have been registered, with 13 new breeds making their debuts in the breed-judging, gamekeepers' classes and obedience championships.

Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko lauded the competition as the 'best dog show in the world'.

She said: 'The fact that dog owners continue to come in their thousands to celebrate their dogs on the world's most famous dog stage is testament to what a special place Crufts holds in the hearts of dog lovers throughout the world.'

Among the main attractions at the 2013 show will be the return of the Crufts Factor competition and the Friends for Life award.

But the event's key event will be the awarding of the prestigious Best in Show title on Sunday.

Miss Kisko added: 'One of my favourite competitions is Friends for Life - each year we hear amazing stories of how dogs have helped people pull through illnesses, given those with disabilities a new lease of life or worked with search teams to rescue those in need.'

This year's Friends for Life contenders include a Birmingham-based police dog which has been involved in more than 285 arrests and once sniffed out a Â£10,000 cache of stolen power tools.

Crufts was founded in the Victorian era by Charles Cruft - with the inaugural show attracting 2,437 entries to the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington in 1891.

The coveted Best in Show was first awarded in 1928 to a greyhound called Primley Sceptre, while Crufts was first televised in 1950.

The prize has been won by 42 different breed, with the English Cocker Spaniel the most successful having amassed seven titles.

Irish Setters and Welsh Terriers have each won on four occasions.

The 13 new breeds competing this year include the Basset Bleu de Gascogne, Bavarian Mountain Dog, Beauceron, Bergamasco, Catalan Sheepdog, Cirneco Dell'Etna and Eurasier.

Visitors to the NEC will also see the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Korean Jindo, Lagotto Romagnolo, Mexican Hairless, Slovakian Rough-Haired Pointer and the Swedish Lapphund for the first time at the event.

Crufts takes up more than 25 acres of the NEC near Birmingham, equivalent to the area of around 12 football pitches.

The final night of this year's event is to be broadcast for the first time on Channel 4, while the remainder of the four-day show is being screened on More4.

The show's arena programme is also being streamed live on YouTube.
