It's long been thought our moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago - but the time of formation has been fiercely debated.

Some scientists believe it occurred approximately 30 million years after the formation of the solar system, while others claim it happened up to 100 million years later.

Using measurements from the interior of Earth coupled with computer simulations, an international team of planetary scientists claim it was the latter - and have discovered what it is calling a ‘geological clock.’

Using measurements from the interior of Earth, coupled with  computer simulations, an international team of planetary scientists earlier this year claimed the moon, pictured, formed 95 million years after the formation of the solar system, 4.6 billion years ago - plus or minus 32 to 39 million years

Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago.

This is called the giant impact hypothesis.

The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 Gya.

The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon.

The researchers from France, Germany and the U.S carried out 259 computer simulations of the growth of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.

During this analysis, the scientists discovered a link between when the Earth was hit, and the amount of material added to Earth after the impact.

This relationship works much like a clock to date the moon-forming event and is said to be the first ‘geologic clock’ in early solar system history that does not rely on measurements and interpretations of the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei to determine age.

‘We were excited to find a 'clock' for the formation time of the Moon that didn't rely on radiometric dating methods,’ said lead author Seth Jacobson of the Observatory de la Cote d'Azur in Nice, France.

‘This correlation just jumped out of the simulations and held in each set of old simulations we looked at.’

The amount of mass that was released by Earth after the moon was formed was taken from previous studies.

The solar system is thought to have formed 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of part of a molecular cloud. The majority of the collapsing mass formed in in the centre, which became the Sun, while the rest flattened into a disk, artist's impression pictured, out of which the planets and moons formed

These reports previously demonstrated that the abundance in the Earth's mantle of highly siderophile elements - atomic elements that are chemically associated with iron - is directly proportional to the mass released after Earth’s impact.

From these geochemical measurements, the newly established clock dates the moon to approximately 95 million years after the beginning of the solar system - with an uncertainty of between 32 and 39 million years.

The solar system is believed to have formed around 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of part of a molecular cloud.

The majority of the collapsing mass formed in the centre, which became the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk, out of which the planets and moons formed.

‘This result is exciting because in the same simulations that can successfully form Mars in only 2 to 5 million years, we can also form the moon at 100 million years,’ added author Dr. Kevin Walsh from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) Space Science and Engineering Division.

‘These vastly different timescales have been very hard to capture in simulations.’

The findings are reported in the journal Nature.
