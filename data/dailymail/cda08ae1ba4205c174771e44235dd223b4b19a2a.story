They are meant to excite and tantalize viewers, creating suspense and intrigue. 

Producers hope to pack enough action into their film trailers to make people go to the cinema as soon as films are released. 

But now cinemagoers are reporting that trailers can actually be a huge disappointment - either giving away the entire plot of a film or being better than the movie itself.

Cinemagoers want to be excited and teased in film trailers such as for The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug, but many feel trailers are giving too much away or are more exciting and engaging than the film, research found 

Research by the University of East Anglia's school of art, media and American studies found that more than 80 per cent of people have been left disappointed with a film after seeing the trailer. 

Some viewers complained about spoilers while others said the trailers created unrealistic expectations of action and adventure that never materialised. 

The researchers studied responses to the trailer for The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug, found that audiences want trailers which excite, tease and leave them emotionally engaged, without revealing excessive narrative.

Lead researcher Keith Johnston said: 'Despite the enduring appeal and apparent popularity of these coming attractions, modern trailer releases arrive with a perceived popular stigma - the presumption that they actively mislead or deceive audiences.

Viewers criticised the trailer for the new Hobbit film for its special effects and departing from the actual book 

The Man of Steel trailer had an emotional and engaging tone which viewers felt was absent from the film 

'Our research confirms this complaint. 

'But we also found that audiences are aware of those issues when they watch a trailer, and find trailers enjoyable despite the expectations that a marketing campaign might set up.' 

The trailer for the next Hobbit film was criticised for the HD look of the film, its perceived reliance on cameos and over reliance on cameo appearances.

Among the complaints about trailers were that they gave away too much of the action and plot, and gave a 'distorted view' of the film. 

Others complained that the trailer for The Grand Budapest Hotel was more exciting than the movie they saw 

Films such as Free Willy have been criticised in the past for giving away the plot and ending of the 1993 movie 

The Superman film, Man of Steel, was criticised by respondents to the survey for having a strong emotional and narrative hook, which viewers felt the film lacked.

The Grand Budapest Hotel was also viewed by many as being a disappointing film after an engaging and fun trailer led people to expect more. 

Prometheus however was praised in the study as 'wonderful in its own right, and did an absolutely brilliant job of showcasing something that promised to be thoughtful, spectacular and exciting.'

The trailer for Cast Away gives away the plot that Tom Hanks eventually is rescued and returns to see his wife 

Prometheus was one of the films praised for its trailer, showcasing the action that features in the film itself 

Mr Johnston added: 'The key message to trailer producers, however, is that audiences want to be excited and teased about forthcoming films, to be emotionally engaged without feeling pummelled by excessive narrative revelation.'

Other films have been criticised for giving away too much in their trailers. 

In the trailer for Free Willy viewers are already informed of the ending of the classic, with a shot of the killer whale freed and swimming in the ocean. 

Similarly in Cast Away an image of Tom Hanks returning to his wife after spending so long stranded on the beach may create emotion, but also gives viewers a clue as to the ending of the film.
