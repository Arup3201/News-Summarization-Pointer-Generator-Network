Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner has blasted the Gunners for wasting his time last season.

The 26-year-old left North London in the summer, signing a three-year-deal with Bundesliga side Wolfsburg on a free transfer.

According to Bendtner, the Danish international was thriving in Serie A on loan with Juventus during the 2012-2013 season, despite only making nine appearances, but was asked to return by Arsene Wenger after the loan stint.

The Danish international was frustrated by a lack of opportunities at Arsenal during last season in London

‘I played regularly for Juventus until I got injured. At Arsenal I barely played. My last year was wasted there,’ Bendtner told Bild.

The 26-year-old scored 24 goals in 106 appearances for Arsenal during a nine-year stint in England and clearly misses the capital city.

‘Wolfsburg is obviously different. But it’s not bad here. And if I want a larger city, one is by train in an hour in Berlin. There I have many friends.

‘I miss my son. If I have a day off, I will always try to travel to London to spend time with him. London is my city, I lived there since I was 16.

‘Of course, I also miss my friends. But the Bundesliga ​​is my new beginning. The important thing now is football. Life comes afterwards.’

Bendtner endured a torrid final season at Arsenal, making only 14 appearances and scoring twice.

‘I was loaned to Juve. It went well there. I played regularly, and I was fit. Then I got injured, had to miss the next six months,’ added Bendtner.

‘We were champions, I wanted to stay. But Arsenal took me back. I wasted a year there. That annoys me the most.’

Despite moving on Bendtner has failed to start a match or score yet for his new Bundesliga club.
