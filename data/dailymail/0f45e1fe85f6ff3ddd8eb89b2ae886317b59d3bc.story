A group of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga troops were greeted like heroes when they arrived in Turkey early this morning on their way to Syria to fight Islamic State militants.

Some 150 fighters arrived at Ruha airport in Sanilufa at about 1am local time, before setting off in buses escorted by Turkish security forces towards the Mursitpinar border crossing with Syria.

From there, the troops will make the 200-yard journey to the besieged city of Kobane, where they will be met by a convoy of vehicles containing heavy weapons, and by hundreds of grateful Syrian Kurdish fighters who have been battling ISIS militants in the city for the past six weeks.

The unprecedented mission comes after Ankara agreed to allow the peshmerga to cross into Syria via Turkey - although the Turkish prime minister reiterated he will not send any ground forces from his own country.

After a rousing send-off from thousands of cheering, flag-waving supporters in the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Irbil, the peshmerga forces landed at Ruha airport in the early hours of this morning.

Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the BBC sending the peshmerga was 'the only way to help Kobane, since other countries don't want to use ground troops.'

The Islamic State launched its offensive on Kobane and nearby Syrian villages in mid-September. The fighting has so far killed more than 800 people, according to activists. More than 200,000 people have fled across the border into Turkey.

The Sunni extremists of ISIS have captured dozens of Kurdish villages around Kobane and still controls parts of the town despite a U.S.-led coalition carrying out dozens of airstrikes targeting the militants.

The deployment of the 150 peshmerga fighters, who were authorized by the Iraqi Kurdish government to go to Kobane, underscores the sensitive political tensions in the region.

Turkey's government views the Syrian Kurds defending Kobane as loyal to what Ankara regards as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. That group has waged a 30-year insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and NATO.

Under pressure to take greater action against ISIS - from the West as well as from Kurds inside Turkey and Syria - the Turkish government agreed to let the fighters cross through its territory. 

But it only is allowing peshmerga forces from Iraq, with whom it has a good relationship, and not those affiliated with the PKK.

A separate Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga convoy of vehicles carrying cannons and machine guns crossed into Turkey this morning at the Ibrahim Khalil border crossing at Zakho in northern Iraq. The land convoy and fighters were expected to join up the Mursitpinar and cross  into Syria as one unit.

A small group of Syrian rebels entered the embattled border town of Kobane from Turkey today on a mission to help Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State extremists in Syria, activists and Kurdish officials said.

The group of around 50 armed men is from the Free Syrian Army, and it's separate from Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters who are also this morning en route to Kobane.

Idriss Nassan, a Kurdish official from Kobani, said the FSA group crossed to Kobani through the Mursitpinar border crossing in Turkey. Nassan, who spoke in Mursitpinar, said they travelled in cars but did not have more details.

A Kurdish journalist in Kobane and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed that a group of about 50 FSA fighters entered the city this morning.

The FSA is an umbrella group of mainstream rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad. The political leadership of the Western-backed FSA is based in Turkey, where fighters often seek respite from the fighting.

Peshmerga soldiers carrying Kurdish flags were atop some of the vehicles as they headed from Irbil to the Iraqi-Turkish border crossing. 

The troops made the victory sign for the cameras. An ambulance and government vehicles blaring their sirens accompanied the convoy.

Scores of people waited by the side of the road in villages for the troops to pass. Thousands of people awaited them at the border. 

The crowd sang and chanted traditional peshmerga songs and had to be pushed back by every vehicle that tried to make its way through the masses. 

Many people carried colorful Kurdish flags and portraits of the Iraqi Kurdish regional President Massoud Barzani.

The Kurds of Syria and Iraq have become a major focus in the war against the Islamic State group, with Kurdish populations in both countries under significant threat by the militant group's lightning advance as it seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region.

The Iraqi Kurdish parliament voted overwhelmingly to send fighters to Kobane, underscoring the growing cooperation among the Kurds in Iraq and Syria. 

The action marked the first mission for the peshmerga outside Iraq.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. officials 'certainly encourage' the deployment of Iraqi peshmerga forces to Kobane.

It will provide much-needed support for the Syrian Kurds, although it is not clear whether Turkey will allow the peshmerga fighters to carry enough weaponry to make an impact.

Yesterday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces carried out four airstrikes near Kobani in the past 24 hours, destroying four ISIS fighting positions and a small ISIS unit.

In Berlin yesterday, Syria's neighbors urged European countries at a conference of foreign ministers and representatives from 40 nations to open their doors to more refugees, and for immediate financial and technological help as their infrastructures buckle under the massive influx of civilians fleeing the conflict.

Turkey has agreed to train and equip moderate Syrian rebel forces that have for more than three years sought to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad.

More than 3 million people have fled Syria because of the conflict, mostly to neighboring countries. Another 6 million are displaced within Syria.

The conflict began with largely peaceful protests in March 2011 calling for reform. It eventually spiraled into a civil war as people took up arms following a brutal military crackdown on the protests.

Islamic extremists, including foreign fighters, have joined the war, playing an increasingly prominent role in the conflict. 

Thousands have died in battles between opposing rebel groups since the beginning of the year.
