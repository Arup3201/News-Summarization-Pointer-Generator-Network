Belgium were many people's World Cup dark horses and it seems their Prime Minister is supremely confident about his country's chances against the USA.

Elio Di Rupo took to Twitter on Tuesday ahead the last 16 meeting between the sides to challenge US President Barack Obama to a bet.

Di Rupo tweeted: 'Hey @BarackObama, I am betting some great Belgian beers that our @BelRedDevils will make it to the quarter final! :-) #ComeOnBelgium #BEL'.

Obama is yet to respond and he may not do so with Jurgen Klinsmann's side underdogs for the clash.

Obama is keenly following his side's progress in Brazil and even watched their 1-0 defeat to Germany on his private plane Air Force One.

After the defeat, he said: 'The U.S. exceeded expectations. This year you get a sense it has captured popular imagination.'

America no doubt will be gripped even further if they can beat Belgium and reach the quarter finals.
