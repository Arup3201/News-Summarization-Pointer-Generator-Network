Hundreds of railway stations are to open ‘click and collect’ stores, including changing rooms, for people to pick up their internet purchases

Women shopping on the web for the perfect little black dress or a new pair of shoes will be able to collect them up the following day from the train station as they make their way home.

Many of the outlets will have changing rooms to allow people to try on their latest purchases and return them immediately if they don’t fit or match expectations.

Hundreds of railway stations are to open Doddle click and collect stores where customers can pick up their internet purchases and try them on. Pictured is the first such store in Milton Keynes

Big brands such as the fashion chains ASOS, New Look and TM Lewin, have joined the initiative with many other stores and courier firms expected to follow suit.

Open seven days a week, the shops will fit around people’s busy lifestyles and enable them to choose exactly how, when and where they receive or return internet purchases.

The initiative offers huge benefits for shoppers, who do not have to wait at home for deliveries, while retailers can save on couriers by dropping items off at one central hub.

There will also be an associated website and notifications service through text message and email to let customers know when their parcel has arrived.

The scheme is the result of a £24million joint venture between Network Rail, which runs the nation’s stations, and the founder of the Travelex currency bureaux chain, Lloyd Dorfman.

The first of the chain of click and collect stores, which is called Doddle, has opened in Milton Keynes with others to follow at London Waterloo, Bromley South, Brighton, Chelmsford and London Cannon Street before the end of August.

The rest of the 300 will open over the next three years, creating an estimated 3,000 jobs in a venture that will turn railway stations into internet shopping hubs.

The Doddle service is the only one of its kind that is available to every retailer, e-tailer, parcel carrier and shipper, creating a network of hubs for the collection and return of web purchases.

Customers using the service pay no fee
 provided the retailer, such as ASOS, is an official Doddle partner. 
However, people can also choose to get items from other web outlets 
delivered to the chain’s railway shops for a small fee, which is likely 
to be less than £5.

A Doddle
 spokesman said: ‘The service will allow consumers to combine 
collections and returns from multiple retailers into one trip at a time 
that suits them or coincides with an already planned journey.’

Chief executive, Tim Robinson, who was previously a senior executive at Network Rail, said: ‘We created Doddle to improve the online shopping experience. We’re not another ‘me too’ click and collect offer, it’s a game-changing service consumers are crying out for but no one else can provide. 

‘We offer a premium service with contemporary shops, advanced technology and highly trained staff delivering a dedicated customer experience.

‘It is the next major step in online shopping, providing a parcel collection, returns and delivery service that has customer choice and convenience at its very heart.  What’s more, we are delivery carrier and retailer agnostic so any brand can offer the Doddle service to their customers.’

Robin Gisby, Network Rail’s managing director, network operations said: ‘More people are travelling by rail than ever before and stations have become more than just a place to wait for, or get off a train. We’ve adapted to passengers’ changing needs and now offer quality retail, food and drink at our biggest stations, such as London Waterloo.

‘Introducing Doddle to stations will enable us to reinvest our profits back into the railway and is a natural next step to help passengers and people who work and live near stations, whose lives are increasingly busy and on the move.’
