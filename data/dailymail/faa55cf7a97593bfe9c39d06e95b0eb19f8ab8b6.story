Jordan's decision to execute its ISIS-linked prisoners in retaliation for the death of its pilot will only serve to fuel more revenge attacks by the terror group, a security analyst said today.

The Kingdom hanged two jihadists this morning hours after vowing to avenge the death of Moaz al-Kasasbeh, who was shown being torched alive in a video released yesterday.

Jordan has also promised to follow through on a threat to execute four other prisoners convicted of being associated with ISIS.

But while such an uncompromising strategy may have struck a chord with the Jordanian public, security experts have warned of the dangers of adopting an eye-for-an-eye response.

Andreas Krieg, a professor for defence studies at King's College London in Qatar, told MailOnline: 'The Jordanian response to the execution of their pilot was purely an act of blind revenge.

'It was driven by negative emotions such as anger rather than the ambition of achieving justice.

'Moreover, punishing jihadists by executing senior commanders will only cause revenge – something that Jordan, a country under pressure, should try to avoid. 

'At its core, the Islamic State can still act with impunity. Executing some Al Qaeda operatives who were only marginally related to the roots of ISIS is not going to change this.

'This round goes to ISIS. Jordan puts itself on the same level by letting anger and hatred prevail over justice.' 

The gruesome death of 26-year-old Lt Al-Kaseasbeh, captured while participating in airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition, sparked outrage and anti-Islamic State group demonstrations in Jordan.

Newspaper headlines warned Jordan 'will take revenge' for his slaying as King Abdullah II, a staunch Western ally, rushed back to his kingdom from Washington.

In its first response, Jordan executed Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad al-Karbouly, two Iraqis linked to Al Qaeda, government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said.

Sajida al-Rishawi (pictured inside a military court in 2006) and Ziad al-Karbouli, have already been executed after Jordan promised a swift and lethal response to the brutal ISIS video

Islamic State had demanded Rishawi's release in exchange for the life of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. 

However, Goto was later beheaded by the group, with images of his death released in a video last Saturday.

Jordan had insisted that they would only release the woman as part of a deal to free the pilot, who, it has since emerged was killed a month ago making a mockery of any negotiations.

Dr Krieg added: 'This act of vengeance by the Jordanian King is really not a sign of strength. It is an act of weakness.

'(The executions) are a desperate attempt by King Abdullah to show strength to an outraged public that has been unusually vocal in their criticism of the palace's dealing with the hostage situation.

'After agreeing to negotiate the execution of the pilot, which already happened a month ago, it is a slap in the King's face.  

'ISIS demonstrated that they can stage an execution in this manner in their capital Raqqa while appearing untouchable.' 

Some analysts also believe Jordan could escalate its involvement in the campaign against Islamic State, which has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria, Jordan's neighbours to the north and east.

The latest murder by Islamic State terrorists represents a new level of barbarity from a group notorious for its savagery.

As with previous beheading videos, footage of Moaz al-Kasasbeh’s murder is characterised by its slick production values and graphics.

But unlike the others, it contains an added cinematic dimension clearly designed to achieve heightened impact – as if the horror of burning alive wasn’t enough.

ISIS blames the fighter pilot for burning houses and killing babies with airstrikes before he was captured in December.

The manner of his death is a symbolic show of strength to strike terror into ‘non-believers’ and encourage doubters within their ranks.

And while the beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John were often static – showing the terrorist standing behind his victims – this clip combines aerial shots, panoramic views and changing camera angles that would have taken far longer to edit.

Reports from Jordan suggest al-Kasasbeh may have died as long ago as January 3, suggesting the video has been a month in the making.

The new clip also contains more of the landscape than has previously been shown, which intelligence experts will analyse for clues as to the jihadists’ whereabouts.

It is the latest in a propaganda war in which the terror group seem intent on finding new ways to provoke horror and disgust.

As well as posting footage of executions on social media, they have also used captured British photojournalist John Cantlie – who is still believed to be alive – to present videos attacking the West.

In Washington, Abdullah II and President Barack Obama vowed in a hastily arranged White House meeting Tuesday not to let up in the fight against the Islamic State group. 

Abdullah has portrayed the campaign against the extremists as a battle over values. In a speech later aired on Jordanian state television, he urged his countrymen to unite.

'It's the duty of all of us to stand united and show the real values of Jordanians in the face of these hardships,' Abdullah said.

U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter Jr, a California Republican, said after a meeting with congressional lawmakers and King Abdullah that the Jordanian monarch had been visibly angry and promised swift and certain retaliation against Islamic State group militants.

'They're starting more sorties tomorrow than they've ever had. 

'They're starting tomorrow,' Hunter told the Washington Examiner in an interview published online Tuesday night.

Hunter added the king also said: 'The only problem we're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.' 

That uncompromising response will strike the right chord with his own people, who were shocked over the brutality of ISIS's latest execution video.

But Dr Labib Kamhawi, a Jordanian political analyst once threatened with prosecution for criticising the King, says this commitment to engaging with ISIS may wane before too long.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘The initial effect is that there is a massive feeling of anger and solidarity amongst the people of Jordan against ISIS.

'But you cannot count on this as time passes because initially Jordan was severely divided over this particular issue and a good number of them feel this is not our war, we should not be involved.

‘Lots of people wouldn’t be willing to express this position now because they might be labelled as anti-patriotic.'

He said the decision to join the airstrikes did not come out of public debate or consultation. 

He added: 'The King made the decision and the King knows and only he knows exactly why Jordan is involved in this fight.

‘Personally I don’t think our involvement would lead to anything or mean anything. It’s symbolic involvement but its repercussions are immense.

‘I think ISIS itself knows that what’s taking place is funny, not serious. Airstrikes never won a war against paramilitary organisations.

‘They will continue to grow as long as there’s enough grievances and anger among people in the region.

‘I would not support [further air strikes]. It would lead to nothing. Jordan is far too weak. 

'Jordan’s political position is far more important. If it put an end to the supply route to Syria across Jordan that could be more effective.’  

After word spread that the pilot had been killed, dozens of people chanting slogans against the Islamic State group marched toward the royal palace to express their anger. 

Waving a Jordanian flag, they chanted, 'Damn you, Daesh!' - using the Arabic acronym of the group - and 'We will avenge, we will avenge our son's blood.' 

'There is no religion accepts such act,' Amman resident Hassan Abu Ali said. 

'Islam is a religion of tolerance. (The Islamic State group) have nothing to do with Islam. This is criminal act.'  

Protesters also marched in the pilot's home village of Ai and set a local government office on fire. Witnesses said the atmosphere was tense and that riot police patrolled the streets.

Al-Kaseasbeh is from a tribal area in southern Jordan's Karak district. 

The tribes are considered a mainstay of support for the monarchy, but the pilot's capture has strained that relationship. 

Members of the pilot's family have repeatedly accused the government of botching efforts to win his release and have also criticized Jordan's participation in the anti-Islamic State group alliance.

Jordan faces increasing threats from the militants. Jordan borders areas of Islamic State group's self-declared caliphate. 

There also have been signs of greater support for the group's militant ideas among Jordan's young and poor.

David L Phillips, a former State Department adviser on the Middle East, said he believes the pilot's killing could backfire, antagonising Sunnis against the extremists, including Sunni tribes in Iraq. 

He also said the extremist group's recent military setbacks may have fueled the killings.

'They need to compensate for that with increasingly gruesome killings of prisoners,' said Phillips, director of the Program on Peace-building and Human Rights at Columbia University.
