Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella fully expects sought-after winger Juan Cuadrado to stay at the club despite media reports linking him with a move to the Premier League.

The Colombia international has been a rumoured target of Manchester United in the past few years while Chelsea are reportedly willing to pay Cuadrado's buyout clause set at £26.8million to acquire him this month.

'As of today, there's no possibility that Cuadrado will leave Fiorentina,' Montella told the Italian press. 'He (Cuadrado) knows that certain things are exaggerated.

Chelsea are reportedly ready to meet the winger's £26.8m buyout clause to bring him to Stamford Bridge

'There are just rumours and he is not paying attention to all that.'

The 26-year-old joined Fiorentina in 2012 from Udinese and has been a regular in Montella's side since.

Cuadrado scored 15 goals in 43 appearances in all competitions for the Viola in the 2013-14 campaign.

The Colombian came to the attention of clubs including Man United  following his World Cup performances

The South American, who was one of the stand-out players alongside James Rodriguez for Colombia in last year's World Cup in Brazil, is under contract at the Artemio Franchi stadium until June 2019.

He has scored four goals and set up four more in 16 league appearances for Fiorentina so far this season.

Cuadrado scored from the penalty spot to help Fiorentina beat Atalanta 3-1 on Wednesday night and reach the quarter finals of the Coppa Italia.
