What does a celebrity stylist do when she can't find any shoes she likes? Create her own range of course.

Willowy fashion editor Nicole Smallwood, 35, has spent years searching for stylish shoes to fit her size nine feet. Despite working on the industry's top glossies and having access to some of the flashiest fashion cupboards around, the 5ft 10in brunette has always had difficulty finding on-trend heels.

So the London-based fashion expert decided to design her own.

Celebrity stylist Nicole Smallwood has created a range of cool shoes for bigger feet

Nicole said: 'Being a stylist you’d think I’d have the pick of the bunch when it comes to finding fabulous shoes for myself. Wrong! It has always been a real chore to find shoes I can actually squeeze my feet into. And the ones I can fit into aren't generally stylish enough to be worn around my friends.

'The High Street really doesn't cater well for women with larger feet - and there are lots of us around. Heels, especially, are really difficult to find - most shops seem to assume that if we are tall we must want to live in flats.

'But I LOVE wearing heels. And I have been on the quest for the perfect pair ever since I started working in fashion over ten years ago.'

Birmingham-born Nicole, whose clients have 
included Elle MacPherson, Liv Tyler, Jessica Ennis and Abbey Clancy has teamed up with online shoe brand Upper Street to launch her 
debut collection.

'I wanted to create a range of classics with a twist that are flattering, wearable and still very stylish. The perfect court, the wear-anywhere strappy sandal and that killer shoe-boot that we all need in our wardrobes,' she said.

The 11-piece collection - all named after Nicole's most stylish friends - features a mixture of metallic suedes in pink, amethyst and pewter and textured black fabrics including velvet, pony skin and shiny patent.

Classic peep and pointed toe courts are given a twist with a sexy D’orsay cut or ankle strap and sandals feature delicate toe and T-bar straps in mirrored silver and lacquered black patent.

Available in various heel and width heights the shoes are sold alongside Upper Street's design-your-own bespoke collection.

Nicole says: 'The aim of my first collection is to help remove the stigma from having larger feet and produce a line that shows it is possible to have fashionable shoes in larger sizes.'

Julia Grinham, Co-Founder of Upper Street said: 'We are extremely excited to be working with Nicole on this collaboration. Our customers have been asking us for a long time to launch a range of shoes for women with larger feet.

'They are fed up of feeling excluded from the market and want to be able to buy stylish and glamorous ready to wear shoes too.'

Nicole has worked in the fashion industry for over ten years and hopes her debut shoe collection including the £235 Boyce (r) will give women with bigger feet the confidence to wear hot heels

The £220 Frenchie design features a double ankle strap

 1. Its all about texture this season make sure you have at least one pair of velvet shoes in your wardrobe.

2. Anyone can wear an ankle strap. Make sure you experiment and find out the thickness that suits you best, proportion is everything.

3. Accessorise your feet subtly for evening with understated sparkle that shimmers and doesn't shout.

4. More women are wanting shoes that look sexy yet they still able to walk in. Look out for heels that are just out of the clouds.

5. The shoe-boot is still a key shape weather it be autumn of winter choose one that takes you from day to night.
