The Rodial cream comes in at £150

A new anti-wrinkle cream is creating a big buzz in the world of cosmetics - because it's made from bee venom.

Cosmetic maker Rodial has just launched a new skincare line called Bee Venom, which is clinically proved to halt the damaging effects of the menopause on the face.

Experts say that as well as mood swings, sleeplessness and weight-gain, women going through the menopause also suffer a variety of skin problems.

Deep wrinkles, puffiness and dryness are just some of the symptoms brought on by hormone changes at this time of life.

During the menopause, levels of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone drop rapidly leading to accelerated skin ageing.

Levels of collagen and elastin also go down, leading to saggy skin and deep wrinkles and production of skin-hydrating acids and oils also significantly drop, causing dryness and a 'crepe' appearance to the skin.

Studies show that more than half of British women are unaware of the impact the menopause has on their skin.

In trials involving 14 women aged between 50 and 59, all the volunteers said the bee venom cream improved the texture of their skin, reduced lines and wrinkles and left them appearing 'visibly more youthful'.

Honey bee venom is used cosmetically to 'fool' the skin into thinking it has been lightly stung with the toxin melittin.

This causes the body to direct blood towards the area and stimulates the production of the naturally-occurring chemicals collagen and elastin.

Collagen strengthens body tissue while elastin is the protein that helps the skin to remain taut and bounce back into shape after being pressed or pinched.

The venom also has the effect of relaxing the muscles, it is claimed.

Experts collect bee venom by placing a pane of glass alongside a hive and running a weak electrical current through it, which encourages the insects to sting the surface.

Because the bee's lance remains in its body, it does not die.

Tiny quantities of the venom are then collected. It is so valuable that it costs up to £30,000 for one ounce.

Bee Venom facial moisturiser costs £150 for a 50-millilitre pot, while an eye cream version costs £115 for a 25-millilitre tub.

A spokesman for Rodial said: 'Bee Venom moisturiser is an advanced formula that revitalises and renews, giving naturally younger looking skin.

'It works in synergy with a unique complex of plant stem cells to help visibly improve skin tone and elasticity.'

'Other ingredients refine the skin's surface to help plump and smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and provide intensive moisturisation and long-lasting hydration for a radiant complexion.'

Both products are available at leading High Street shops as well as department store John Lewis.

Bees are already responsible for other supposedly anti-ageing products from honey to royal jelly, a health supplement used by celebrities such as Cliff Richard, Lulu and the Duchess of Cornwall.

No harm: The honey bee's lance remains in its body

Holland and Barrett brought us high-tech, bee venom skincare in October 2012 and made it affordable to everyone for the first time - and TV presenter Caroline Flack is a huge fan of their £24.99 ApiNourish Repairing Skin Cream.

Their Manuka Doctor skincare uses the latest in bee venom technology. With over 10,000 bee stings per pot, surprisingly, this range of anti-aging wonders won't break the bank starting from £16.99 in comparison with the hundreds a botox jab will set you back.

Manuka Honey, Shea Butter, Royal Jelly, Rosehip, Blackcurrant, Propolis, Coco and a whole host of other natural ingredients comprise this luxurious range.

Manuka Doctor skincare products range from skin serums to cleansers and masks.

Heaven Skincare, whose Venom Mask is loved by Dannii Minogue, Gwyneth Paltrow and Emilia Fox, have developed an eye-specific product to target lines and dark circles called Bee Venom Eyes. The £55 cream contains Manuka Honey, Bee Venom, and their secret ingredient River Silt to feed the tissue, firming & tightening the skin, for an instantly anti-ageing and rejuvenating effect. 

River Silt works with the enzymes of fish. The river bed collects marine collagen over hundreds of years, from fish enzymes, which gather in the river silt and help the skin by boosting collagen. River silt is full of amino acids and bentonite which remove impurities and toxins from the skin.
