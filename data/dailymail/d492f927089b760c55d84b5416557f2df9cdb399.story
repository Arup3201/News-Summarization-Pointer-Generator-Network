Celtic seem set to reject a plea from Legia Warsaw to have a meeting to decide which club should progress to the Champions League play-off round.

The Polish side beat the Scottish champions 6-1 on aggregate in the third qualifying round but were then kicked out of the competition by Uefa for fielding the ineligible Bartosz Bereszynski in the second leg.

Celtic were reinstated and drawn to face Maribor in the play-off but Legia want another chance to reach that stage, with co-owner Dariusz Mioduski describing the UEFA punishment as 'deeply unjust and contrary to the spirit of fair play'.

Let off? Celtic were handed a Champions League lifeline despite losing 6-1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw

Mioduski has appealed to Scottish champions asking for a one-off tie to decide which side should progress in the Champions League.

After reflecting on Celtic's 'beautiful' history, Mioduski said: 'I therefore call on you to refer your best traditions of honour and honesty, that your famous club has been know for during the last 126 years. Do not destroy the beautiful legacy, that you inherited from the past generations of 'The Bhoys'.

Open letter: Legia Warsaw co-owner Dariusz Mioduski, has asked for a one off game to settle the issue

'I call on you to act according to the spirit of the game and rules of fair play - to issue a joint statement to the UEFA disciplinary bodies. Let's meet in Warsaw or Glasgow and settle this matter honourably.' 

But a Celtic statement read: 'We are disappointed by Legia Warsaw's comments. This is entirely a matter for UEFA and its processes.'
