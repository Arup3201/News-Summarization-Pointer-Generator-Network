With their snooty mannerisms and pompous long-winded descriptions, wine snobs have long been regarded as tedious, insufferable bores.

And now what many have suspected all along has finally been confirmed; most of them are faking it too.

A U.S. study, which used judges at the California state fair wine competition as test subjects, found that only 10 per cent of them realised when they were served the same wine again and again.

Hints of pretension: Nine out of 10 wine experts failed to notice the same vintage being served over and over again

American wine maker Robert Hodgson, who has a background in statistics, asked organisers at the fair if he could run an experiment five years ago.

The judges, who consisted of sommeliers, critics and buyers to wine consultants and winemakers, were given their usual selection of vintages to taste, but some of the wines were served three times, being poured from the same bottle each time.

Duped: An earlier French study found that wine experts would praise a wine if it came from an expensive looking bottle

It revealed that even the most 
highly-respected wine tasters are next to useless when it comes to 
actually making any sort of reliable judgement about the relative 
merits.  

Mr Hodgson, who runs the Fieldbrook Winery in Humboldt County, told the Observer: 'The results are disturbing,' says Hodgson from the , described by its owner as a rural paradise.

'Only about 10 per cent of judges are consistent and those judges who were consistent one year were ordinary the next year.

'Chance has a great deal to do with the awards that wines win.'

The judges were asked to rate wines on a scale running from 50 to 100. On avergae a judge's score for the same bottle of wine varied by aropund eigght points over the three separate tastings.

In one instance the same wine was first rated at 90 before dropping down to 86 and then rocketing up to an excellent 94.

It isn't the first time the art of wine-tasting has come into question. A 2001 French study served the same wine to tasters from two different bottles - one labelled as an expensive 'Grand Cru' from Bordeaux, the other as a cheap table wine.

The tasters were glowing in their descriptions after tasting the wine from the expensive-looking bottle, but critical of the same wine from the cheap-looking bottle
