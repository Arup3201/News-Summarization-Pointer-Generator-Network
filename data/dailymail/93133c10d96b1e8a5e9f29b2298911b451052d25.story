West Ham have put together a £10 million package to land the Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback.

Colback sees his contract at the Stadium of Light run out this summer and the 24-year-old has sparked a Premier League chase between Newcastle, Swansea and the Hammers.

Newcastle believed they were favourites to land the Geordie at the end of last season, with the player privately ready to make the controversial switch to St James' Park.

Pay rise: Colback is set to be paid around £50,000-a-week

He was one of the worst paid players at Sunderland last season on around £6,000-a-week, having come through the ranks.

That alerted their North-east rivals, who were keen to push through a quick deal at the start of the summer.

However West Ham have blown their rivals out of the water by putting together a four-year deal that will rocket Colback's salary up to £50,000-a-week.

The whole package will cost around £10 million but Hammers' bosses believe that is off-set by the fact they won't have to pay a fee for a player who has been at Sunderland since he was a youngster.

Colback has emerged as a key player at Sunderland over the last three seasons, playing over 100 times in the Premier League for a succession of managers, from Steve Bruce, Martin O'Neill, Paolo di Canio through to Gus Poyet.

Poyet was eager to keep the English player this summer, but the club does not have the financial muscle to see off West Ham.
