Since joining George Osborne’s household, she has developed a reputation for being a wanderer.

Now Freya the cat’s latest mysterious disappearance has seen her drawn into something of a political row.

The Chancellor’s pet apparently decided to take a break from life on Downing Street and ambled south of the river.

Found: George Osborne's pet cat, Freya, decided to take a break from life on Downing Street and ambled south of the river. Above, a picture of Freya put out by Thames Reach's London Street Rescue, a homeless charity

She was 
found in Vauxhall by Kate Jones, a homelessness worker, around a mile 
and a half from home and identified by a tag on her collar.

Freya spent the night on Miss Jones’s pillow before being collected by a member of Mr Osborne’s staff in a car.

Miss Jones, 31, who works with Thames Reach’s London Street Rescue, was apparently behind a Twitter message to Freya’s owner.

In
 a picture posted on the site, Freya was seen next to a bowl of food and
 a piece of paper with the words: ‘Found on the streets in Vauxhall. Not
 everyone is as lucky as Freya. George please stop cutting homeless 
services.’

Tweet: She was found in Vauxhall by Kate Jones, of London Street Rescue, around a mile and a half from home. Above, Miss Jones was apparently behind this Twitter message, which was later posted to the Chancellor

Saviour: Freya (right) was apparently found at 11pm on Monday, mewing 
near the Vauxhall roundabout. She spent the night on Miss Jones's (left) pillow
 before being collected by a member of Mr Osborne's staff in a 
car

Miss Jones
 said: ‘I did find it slightly ironic that I had been up at 5am trying 
to help 24 people who had been sleeping rough in Newham and we couldn’t 
find anywhere to send them, then this cat gets chauffeur-driven home.’

Freya was apparently found at 11pm on Monday, mewing for help near the Vauxhall roundabout, one of London’s busiest junctions.

She let herself be caught by Miss Jones and two friends and was fed cat food before settling down.

Chancellor: Mr Osborne bought the tabby for his children in 2009 when the family were living in west London

‘She started purring the moment we put the food in front of her, I think she must have been quite hungry,’ Miss Jones said.

‘Freya is a gorgeous cat and, just like the people we work with, deserved some help in getting home.’

Mr
 Osborne bought the tabby for his children in 2009 when the family were 
living in Notting Hill, West London. But a few months later, she 
vanished.

Fight: After arriving in Downing Street in 2012, Freya was caught landing a paw on David Cameron's cat Larry

It was not until two years ago, having moved into Downing Street, that Mr Osborne’s wife Frances got a call telling her Freya had been found, apparently living as a stray.

Soon after arriving in Downing Street, Freya was caught landing a paw on David Cameron’s cat Larry in a vicious attack that sent him (the cat, that is) fleeing for cover.

Last night a Treasury source said: ‘Freya did go walkabout. Someone kindly arranged for her to be returned. She is now safely back at base.’
