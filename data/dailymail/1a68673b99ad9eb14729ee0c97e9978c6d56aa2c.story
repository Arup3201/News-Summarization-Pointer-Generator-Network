A Spanish television chef has died after his parachute failed to open during a base jump.

Wearing a wingsuit, Darío Barrio collided into a cliff-face in the Sierra Segura mountain range in Jaén Province, Spain, on Friday during the International Air Festival.

Paramedics were called to the scene in the village of Segura de la Sierra near the popular tourist destination of Andalucia, but could not revive him.

The final moments of his doomed flight were caught on camera by a crowd member watching nearby.

Barrio began cooking at the age of
 14, and studied in different parts of Spain as well as interning and 
working at different restaurants.

He became well-known to the Spanish public after appearing on the television program 'Todos contra el Chef' (Everyone against the Chef).

The Epoch Times described how fellow celebrities expressed their condolences on Twitter after hearing news of the tragic death.

Comedian Goyo Jiménez said he was 'in shock' and Miki Nadal described Barrio as 'brave, funny, hardworking, generous, and a fighter.'

Paco Roncero of La Terraza del Casino told his followers on the social media site that he was 'coping with the loss of a great friend.'

Response: Paramedics attend to the chef in the village of Segura de la Sierra. Reports in local media have suggested his parachute failed to open

Career: He began cooking when he was 14 years old and worked at a number of different restaurants before becoming a TV personality

José Andrés , the Spanish chef based in the United States, said that we have sent 'a huge friend to sleep in peace,' and that 'the sky will eat much better.'

Carmen Lomana collapsed upon hearing about the death after hearing of it from Jorge Javier on television.

Barrio has won many awards and was known as a promoter of a healthy lifestyle, including varied and balanced diets.

He was also a big sports fan, running in the New York City Marathon.
