Tragic: Ned Vizzini, 32, committed suicide in New York on Thursday

An author who shot to fame after the publication of his book about his experiences with depression as a teenager has died after committing suicide.

Ned Vizzini, 32, was found dead in New York on Thursday after more than a decade of acclaim as a young adult author, according to the Los Angeles Times.

One of Vizzini's books, 'It's Kind of a Funny Story', was turned into a 2010 movie starring Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts.

That memoir won the Young Adult book 
award by the American Library Association in 2007 and detailed his 
depression, suicidal thoughts and ensuing trip to a psychiatric 
hospital.

When the book was
 published seven years ago, he gave an interview to The New York Times 
wherein he answered questions from parents whose children were also 
struggling with depression and he admitted that while he definitely felt
 much better it was a life-long struggle.

'The
 first and most important step I took happened a week after I left the 
psych hospital, when I realized, while looking over my receipts of all 
things, that suicide was not an option,' he said in the 2006 interview.

Memoir: The book, and ensuing film starring Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts, 'It's Kind Of A Funny Story' was based on Vizzini's trip to a psychiatric ward as a teenager following suicidal thoughts

Depression: In interviews, Vizzini (seen here with his wife Sabra Embury) talked about how while he did still battle mental demons, his trip to the psych ward convinced him that suicide was not the answer

'I had wasted so much time thinking about it and mulling over its intricacies and artistic seductiveness; starting right then and there I crossed it out as an option. From then on it was a hard road — even though I didn't want to kill myself, I didn't really want to live either and I withdrew into oversleeping and under-eating.'

The success of It's Kind Of A Funny Story, which was his third book, helped springboard his writing career and he went on to collaborate on television shows like MTV's Teen Wolf, ABC's The Last Resort.

He was working with J.J. Abrams and Gravity director Alfonso Cuaron at the time of his suicide yesterday.

'We are incredibly saddened at the loss 
of our dear friend and colleague Ned Vizzini. On behalf of everyone in 
the Believe family, we offer our deepest condolences and heartfelt best 
wishes to his friends and family, especially his wife and son, at this 
most challenging of times,' Mr Cuaron said in a statement in conjunction
 with Bad Robot productions.

He was married to fellow writer Sabra Embury and the couple has a two year old son

'He was also incredibly kind and he adored his family and friends,' his publisher Alessandra Balzer said in a statement.

'At his signings, countless kids would approach him to say that he changed their lives — he gave them hope.'
