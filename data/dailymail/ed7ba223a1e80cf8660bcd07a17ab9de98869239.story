A  father stabbed to death his transgender daughter at their Ohio home  before telling a 911 dispatcher that she was 'in a cult' and had been attacked by fellow members, police have said.

Kevin Golec, 52, allegedly knifed 22-year-old artist and drummer Bri Golec after they got into an argument over money at their house in Inman Street, Akron, at around 10pm last Friday.

He then called 911 and reportedly told a series of lies to cover his crime. 'He's [Bri's] in a cult and all this s***. These guys came in. I fought them off. They got him,' he told the operator.

Police arrived at the scene  and discovered Bri lying unresponsive near the side door of the house with a  stabbing wound to her neck. She was rushed to hospital, where she was declared dead.

Scene: Golec allegedly knifed 22-year-old artist and drummer Bri  after they got into an argument at the house they were living at (pictured) in Inman Street, Akron, at around 10pm last Friday. She was later declared dead

Now, Golec has been arrested on murder and domestic violence charges. He is currently being held at the Summit County Jail and is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday, according to ABC 5.

In the hours after the killing, many local news outlets reported on the incident, but referred to Bri as 'Brian'. Her mother, Christine Hamblin, and fiancée, Sarah Price, also used male pronouns.

Although Bri's gender identity remains disputed, Jacob Nash, the head of an Akron-based support group for transgender people, has since confirmed the victim was a transgender woman.

Speaking to the Akron Beacon Journal, he said: 'I'm just devastated by the fact that this young woman who had so much potential and so much ahead of her... her life was cut short.' 

'She had come to the support group several years ago and started coming back again  recently.'

He added that he was not sure what  Golec had meant by 'cult' in his 911 call, during which the alleged killer cried 'Oh my God' several times and accused 'cult' members of storming the house.

Disputed: In the hours after the killing, many local news outlets reported on the incident, but referred to Bri as 'Brian'. Her mother, Christine Hamblin (pictured with Bri when she was a child), also used male pronouns

Victim: Although the victim's (pictured) gender identity remains disputed, Jacob Nash, the head of an Akron-based support group for transgender people, has since declared the victim was a transgender woman

'I don't know if that was geared toward the transgender community or not,' said Mr Nash.

The Columbus-based group, TransOhio, also paid tribute to Tri in a statement that it released on Sunday, saying: 'Please keep our Akron trans community in your thoughts and prayers.'

Police Lieutenant Rick Edwards said the force was unaware of Bri's transgender status, but added that it was not a factor in the stabbing, which occurred in the 1100 block of Inman Street.

He said Golec had drug issues and had been taking money from the family. The troubled father had moved into the house Bri shared with Miss Price in a bid to 'reconnect' with her, relatives said. 

Distraught: On Saturday, Ms Hamblin (pictured) paid tribute to her daughter, a former Coventry High School, Connecticut, student who played in band and apparently dreamed of studying biomedical engineering

Fiancee: Bri's fiancee, Sarah Price (pictured), described the victim as a 'beautiful soul' and 'my soul mate'

Musical: Bri (pictured), whose interests included 'painting, jewelry making, meditation, martial arts, video games, and anime', was ruled to have died from a neck stab wound by the Summit County Medical Examiner

On Saturday, Ms Hamblin paid tribute to her daughter, a former Coventry High School, Connecticut, student who played in a band and apparently dreamed of studying biomedical engineering. 

Referring to Bri as her 'son', she said: He cared more for other people than he did himself. It's just so heartbreaking for me.' Miss Price described Bri as a 'beautiful soul' and 'my soul mate'. 

In an email to Raw Story, Geoff Ackerman, Bri's friend and fellow Murphy's Children band member, also disputed claims the victim was transgender, writing: 'Did Brian at one time identify as Bri? Yes.

'However, within the last year or so, he identified as Brian, and if I had to put a label on him (something he would hate, by the way), he would identify as an androgynous pansexual man.' 

Raising money: Bri's family and friends have set up a GoFundMe page to pay for expenses. On the page, the victim is listed as 'Brian'. She is the sixth transgender individual to have suffered a violent death in 2015

A family obituary also lists Bri - who was first labeled transgender in the context of her killing by LGBT blog Pittsburg Lesbian Correspondents - as 'Brian' and uses male pronouns throughout. 

Bri, whose interests included 'painting, jewelry making, meditation, martial arts, video games, and anime', was ruled to have died from a neck stab wound by the Summit County Medical Examiner.

She is the sixth transgender individual to have suffered a violent death in 2015. The other victims were Lamia Beard, Ty Underwood, Yazmin Vash Payne, Taja Gabrielle DeJesus and Penny Proud.

Bri's family and friends have set up a GoFundMe page to pay for expenses.
