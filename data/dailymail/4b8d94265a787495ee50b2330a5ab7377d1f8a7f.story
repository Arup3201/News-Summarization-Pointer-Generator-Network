Russia is sending warships to Syria in an apparent show of strength in support of President Bashar al-Assad and his embattled regime.

The move to defend Moscow’s interests in the strife-torn country came as a United Nations report revealed horrifying new details of children being tortured to death by Syrian government thugs.

Soldiers have killed at least 256 children since Assad’s crackdown on anti-government protests began in March, according to the UN probe.

The report said that men and boys were sexually tortured at military jails and a two-year-old girl was shot dead just to prevent her from growing up to be a demonstrator.

Last night, the disturbing claims piled more international pressure on Assad to end the bloodshed that is believed to have claimed 3,500 lives.

But Russia’s flotilla of warships will give pause to Western leaders pushing for the kind of military intervention in Syria that ultimately drove Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya.

Russia, which has a major naval base in Syria and whose weapons trade with Damascus is worth millions of pounds a year, joined China last month to veto a Western-backed UN Security Council resolution condemning Assad’s government.

Russia is planning to send its flagship aircraft carrier, the ‘Admiral Kuznetsov’ along with a patrol ship, an anti-submarine craft and other vessels towards its base on the Syrian coast near Tartus.

Officially, the Russian Navy said the mission had nothing to do with the uprising.

But retired Russian Admiral Viktor Kravchenko said last night that Moscow was sending a message to the US and European leaders. 

‘Having any military force apart from NATO is very beneficial for the region as it prevents the outbreak of armed conflict,’ he said.

Shocking details of the report to the UN Human Rights Council showed that boys were subjected to sexual torture by their Syrian captors in front of adult men.

‘Torture was applied equally to adults and children,’ said the independent panel.

‘These crimes included murder, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence,’ said the group’s chairman, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, a Brazilian professor. ‘We have a very solid body of evidence,’ he added.

Syrian security forces co-operating with militias were said to have been given ‘shoot to kill’ orders to quash protests.

Injured people taken to military hospitals were beaten and tortured during interrogations carried out by government forces dressed up as doctors 

On April 25, in Dara, dozens of conscripts who fired into the air rather than follow an order to shoot directly at people’s homes were themselves killed by security posed behind them, said the report.

Arbitrary arrests and unlawful detentions were rife and many of those arrested were blindfolded and handcuffed and denied any food or medical help. Thousands more may have been abducted and disappeared.

The commission said it based its report on interviews with more than 223 victims and witnesses including defectors from Syria’s military and security forces.
