Any man that makes Mike Ashley a lot of money is likely to be a very popular figure with the Newcastle United owner. 

After helping Ashley acquire and sell-on the likes of Yohan Cabaye and Mathieu Debuchy, chief scout Graham Carr has been worth his weight in gold. 

Here, Sportsmail finds out more about the 70-year-old super scout.

Who is Graham Carr?  

He’s the 70-year-old dad of comedian Alan Carr and Newcastle’s super scout.

How super is he?

Well, Graham Carr buys ’em low and Mike Ashley sells ’em high. Think Yohan Cabaye (£15m profit) and Mathieu Debuchy (£7m profit).

Ashley must love him?

He does. Surely no other employee has made him as much money.

Carr is the father of comedian and television presenter Alan (pictured)

What’s his trick?

He scours Europe and knows every player and their contracts.

Anything else?

He played for Northampton Town and managed them between 1985 and 1990.
