A singer is aiming for stardom by creating America’s first transgender pop group.

Nikki Exotika, whose real name is Nicole Sanders, is auditioning transgender singers from across the U.S. for the project, which is ten years in the making.

The 32-year-old, who lives in New York City with her boyfriend, was born Jason Torres and transitioned from male to female in her teens.

Since then, she has spent $250,000 on surgery - including breast implants, lip enhancements, calf implants and rhinoplasty.

Nikki plans to call the group the Secret Girls, which she says will be a cross between the Pussycat Dolls and the Spice Girls.

'I think America is past ready for the Secret Girls,’ said Nikki, who has been a professional singer since 2006 and performs electro-dance-pop shows all over the U.S.

'You know what’s really crazy is the world has seen transgender models, transgender actresses, transgender activists, transgender book writers, but no transgender music artists that went mainstream.'

Nikki, who calls herself Magogany because she’s a ‘mixture of Madonna, Gaga and Britney all in one as in one artist,’ says she always dreamed of being an entertainer.

She said: 'I’ve been performing since I was eight years old - my mom always said I was a little drama queen when I was little.

'But growing up in the wrong body was really difficult, even from two years old I knew that something was just wrong.

'I was putting on make-up in the bathroom, putting nail polish on my nails, always sitting down to pee on the toilet.’

She admits that ‘living this life is not easy,’ and at age 16, she tried to commit suicide.

But now, Nikki is putting all her energy into forming the group and hopes to audition transgender singers from all over the States.

She said: 'The inspiration behind The Secret Girls actually came about when I used to watch the Spice Girls and their different personalities, styles and images.

'When they disbanded and the Pussycat Dolls came about, I saw how sexy and exotic they were so I was like "why not create a group that is transgender?"

Artist statement: 'I sometimes call myself Magogany, because I’m a mixture of Madonna, Gaga and Britney all in one,' Nikki said

'I knew that I had music and I was singing and dancing, I thought there’s got to be girls across the United States that are doing exactly what I’m doing as well.'

During a recent audition in New York, Mimi Nutwood auditioned for Nikki and vocal coach Renee Stakey.

Nikki said: 'Mimi's got a really beautiful voice and she’s pretty much one of the first girls I would choose - but I can’t make a decision until I audition all the hopefuls.'
