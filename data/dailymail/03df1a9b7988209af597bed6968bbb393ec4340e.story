A former chartered accountant who was jailed for a £60,000 fraud is now helping inmates get tax rebates of up to £1,000.

Paul Retout, the former chief executive of Wrexham FC, was jailed for 16 months in October last year after swindling his partners at a London-based accountancy company out of nearly £60,000.

The 53-year-old, of Denbighshire, Wales, was sent to HMP Wandsworth in London where it has now been revealed he offered inmates ‘tax seminars’.

Writing in Inside Time magazine, Retout said many of the UK's 85,000 prisoners are due a tax rebate.

He claims prisoners most likely to be in line for a 'windfall' are those who were jailed before reaching the annual £9,440 personal tax threshold, but who paid tax on earnings before being incarcerated.

He said: ‘While I was recently in prison I volunteered to run a two hour taxation seminar under the business start-up education programme, and to share my tax experiences of setting up a business with my fellow prisoners.

‘What surprised me was that several prisoners attending the seminar were due tax refunds and were simply not aware of the fact.’

Retout, who was released earlier this year, said he soon realised that 'many more' prisoners at the 1,284 capacity jail in south London were due rebates from the taxman.

He said: ‘As the weeks passed, I found that there were many more prisoners also due refunds who did not know the correct procedure to obtain them.

‘The average refund that I calculated while I was in prison was approximately £1,000.’

He said he was then moved to HMP Brixton, where he saw a similar situation, adding: ‘What became clear was that taxation was a topic that prisoners wanted further information on but there was very little support, if any to help them.

‘All prisoners have the right to tax planning to ensure they pay the correct amount of tax and receive tax refunds when due.

‘Many people sent to prison were unaware that they may be entitled to significant tax refunds.’

Retout also provided an advice checklist for inmates to help them claim back any tax owed to them.

As a result of the advice, it is now thought up to 200 prisoners have applied for tax rebates.

One ex-prisoner, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘I've looked into my tax affairs and found I paid too much tax while in jail last year and am due a £800 rebate.

‘I had no idea that I could get a rebate and neither do most people in prison - when you're inside, you don't really think about tax.’

Retout was jailed for 16 months in October last year after he admitted submitting false invoices to his own firm, Quadrangle Group, where he was employed as financial controller.

He was jailed after a hearing at Kingston Crown Court where he admitting committing fraud by abuse of position.
