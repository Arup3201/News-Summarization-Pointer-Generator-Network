As the Tourette's-like illness continues to plague Le Roy school and baffle health experts, questions are now arising around the cleanup of a 40-year-old
chemical spill that contaminated some of the local water supply.

Around 30,000 gallons of trichloroethylene (TCE), an industrial solvent that's hazardous in high 
doses and can affect the nervous system, were dumped into the 
ground during a train crash in 1970 on the outskirts of Le Roy.

The EPA declared the area a Superfund site in 1999 after the TCE soaked into the ground and spread into a plume under part of Le Roy.

Archive pictures: It has been suggested that it was chemicals leaked from a 1940 train crash that is causing the Tourette's like disease

Superfund site: The site of the 1970 train crash has a danger sign warning the public not to enter

Hazardous waste: The EPA declared the area a Superfund site in 1999 after the TCE soaked into the ground and spread into a plume under part of Le Roy

The site is now in a state of disrepair and neglect, according to PIX 11 News, with more than 200 drums of hazardous waste rusting outdoors, some of which had holes in them allowing the contents to leak out.

The 
EPA admitted to the station they didn't know what was in all of the barrels and said about one hundred of them have been there since the 1990s.

A spokesman said: 'The barrels contain dirt and 
rock from when wells were dug to monitor ground water at the site. Most of these drums have been tested 
and contain material that is not considered hazardous and we are 
gathering more information about the balance.

'EPA is taking steps to get these drums 
removed from the site as soon as possible.'

A contractor confirmed to the station that the rock and dirt in the drums did contain TCE.

Danger: Hundreds of barrels containing potentially hazardous material are still at the site, most of which are rusty and leaking their contents

Leak: Around 30,000 gallons of trichloroethylene (TCE) was dumped into the ground during a train crash in 1970 on the outskirts of Le Roy

Cause?: The site was declared a Superfund site and the EPA admitted they do not know what is in the barrels still present in the area

'To be safe, it's put in drums and
carted away and there's a plant that burns it,' he said. 'But it's like everything else. They forget about it until the 
cameras show up and it's like, "Oh, we better get rid of the damn 
things".'

Doctors and teachers at the school deny that the disorder affecting 19 girls and one adult have anything to do with the spill.

Le Roy historian Irene Walters said she remembers the spill and said the chemicals contaminated all the wells in the area and several of her friends died from cancer.

Doctors who have treated or tested
the girls in Le Roy believe they are suffering from conversion 
disorder, or the twitching symptoms are possibly related to an 
infection.

Lori Brownell, 16, posted a video on YouTube showing the Tourettes-like
symptoms she has suffered since August. She is one of 15 at LeRoy High 
School in New York State who have developed the mystery condition

More recently, Facebook and YouTube were being blamed for the mystery illness.

Doctors said that symptoms are being 
‘reinforced and magnified’ because victims of the bizarre condition are 
uploading videos of themselves onto social networking sites to appeal 
for help.

They argue that when other people in 
the town of LeRoy view the videos, they are unconsciously mimicking what
they see and spreading it around.

The true cause of the illness is still
a mystery and there no formal suggestion that Facebook or any of the 
other social networking websites are to blame.

But David Lichter, professor of 
neurology at the University of Buffalo, who has treated several of the 
patients, said he might now understand how it has affected so many 
people.

He told MSNBC: ‘It's remarkable to see
how one individual posts something, and then the next person who posts 
something not only are the movements bizarre and not consistent with 
known movement disorders, but it's the same kind of movements.

‘This mimicry goes on with Facebook or YouTube exposure. This is the modern way that symptomology could be spread.’

In total 19 patients have come forward
with Tourette’s like symptoms since last Fall, which include 
uncontrollable facial and body twitching.

Trying to understand: Thera Sanchez, 17, has had
the mysterious symptoms for months and all of the treatments he has 
received have not helped to clarify any options for her or her family

They include 14 girls aged between 13 
and 18 and this week the first adult victim, 36-year-old nurse 
practitioner Marge Fitzsimmons.

Among those who have taken an interest in the case is environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich.

She has suggested that a chemical 
spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls’ 
school may be the cause.

Researchers have also come up with a 
string of theories and believe teenagers may have been struck down by 
paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, or PANS, which is a 
kind of OCD linked to strep throat.

Other believe that Morgellons could be to blame, which is a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores.

Some doctors have also suggested it 
could be a mass psychogenic illness which can be triggered by stress and
is spread from unconscious mimicry of one another.

Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, chief of 
neurology at the Dent Neurologic Institute in Buffalo, said: ‘When one 
has a symptom, it can be reinforced and magnified with other individuals
with similar symptoms.

‘That's what's going on with these 
girls. They are in a segregated small rural town in New York state. They
are a cohesive group. And this wildfire of symptoms takes control.’

During an angry meeting on Saturday 
parents berated LeRoy schools officials and asked why the soil around 
natural gas well which had been dug on school ground had not been tested
for contamination.

Demanding explanations: Parents gathered for a meeting with school administrators to determine what was being done to ensure the safety of students near the 1970 chemical spill

Patrick Frauley (left) and Beth Miller (right, whose daughter is one of the ill teens, spoke at the meeting

'This could take years! What are you doing to protect my kid? What are you doing to protect these peoples kids?' said parent Patrick Frauley.

Many of the parents of the sick teens attended the meeting, but none of the teens themselves were present.

'I'm not looking for a lawsuit of any kind, I just want my daughter to get better,' said Beth Miller.

Adding to the concern was that the 
wells were drilled using the controversial hydraulic fracturing method, 
also known as ‘fracking’.

Dr Greg Young of the New York State 
Department of Health had earlier explained that tests had ruled out 
environmental factors as the cause of the disease.

He also claimed that genetics, antihistamines or head trauma could be to blame.
