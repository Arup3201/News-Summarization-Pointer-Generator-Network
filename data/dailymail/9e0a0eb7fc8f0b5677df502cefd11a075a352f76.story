A fugitive drug trafficker caught naked in a panic room by police has been brought back to the UK to face a 23-year jail sentence.

Mark Lilley, who went on the run in 2000 when he skipped bail during a trial, was flown back to Britain from Spain this afternoon and taken to high security Belmarsh prison.

Head of the fugitives unit at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) Dave Allen said: 'Lilley was on the run for 13 years but we never gave up. He thought he could evade capture by changing his identity and moving around but he was wrong.

'Soca and its partners have the capability to pursue criminals relentlessly, track them down, and put them behind bars.'

Captured: This is the moment Spanish police take British drugs trafficker Mark Lilley who went on the run for 13 years after being convicted of masterminding a £1million heroin, cocaine and ecstasy racket

Weeded out: Video released by Spanish police shows them bringing the heavily-tattooed gangster out of his panic room which he built at his villa in Alhaurin de la Torre near Malaga

Lilley, 41, from Warrington, Cheshire,
was finally arrested last month when more than 40 armed police officers
launched a dawn raid on his home in Malaga.

The 20-stone, muscle-bound fugitive 
locked himself inside a panic room concealed behind a wardrobe and 
watched the raid on a computer screen linked to security cameras around 
the house.

Although officers tried unsuccessfully
to force the door open several times, Lilley eventually let them in and
surrendered after realising he was trapped.

Video footage released of the raid showed officers climbing over a gate before smashing their way inside with a battering ram.

He was seen wearing only a towel being
handcuffed before being allowed to put some trousers on so he could be 
taken from his villa in the town of Alhaurin de la Torre, near Malaga.

A Spanish police spokesman said at the
time: ‘After we tried to open the security  door to the panic room, he 
gave himself up after he realised he had no other escape route.’

Imposing property: Police had to scale Lilley's villa using ladders before moving in to arrest him

Raided: Officers then smash his front door down with a battering ram

Bolt hole: Lilley was found in a panic room which was hidden in a wardrobe inside a dressing room

A police helicopter hovered above the 
villa during the raid, which was a joint operation by the Spanish 
National Police and Britain’s Serious Organised Crime Agency.

Two other men and a woman were in the house. Officers also found a pistol.

The former gas fitter from St Helens, 
Merseyside, had been on the run for 13 years since skipping bail in 2000
during his trial for masterminding a £1million drugs racket.

Police had wanted him kept in custody until the outcome of his trial. But a High Court judge granted him conditional bail.

Lilley vanished at the same time as a 
woman clerk from his solicitor’s office after giving evidence at Bolton 
Crown Court.

The drugs baron, who dealt in heroin, cannabis, cocaine and
ecstasy, was found guilty of seven charges, including one of having a 
gun with intent to cause fear of violence.

He was jailed for 23 years in his 
absence. By then he had already started living the life of a fugitive in
Europe using different aliases.

Fugitive: The last reported sighting of Lilley was in Playa de las Americas in Tenerife in 2003 by a British police officer on holiday there

In 2003, he was spotted by an off-duty Merseyside officer in the resort of Playa de las Americas, Tenerife.

Lilley – who goes by the nicknames 
Coney, TJ, Fatboy, Big Vern and Mandy – was seen behind the wheel of a 
£40,000 Mercedes but escaped.

Searches were carried out in Tenerife and 
other Canary islands before officers tracked him to mainland Spain, 
where the trail went cold.
