It is one of the most inspiring moments in military history – British and German soldiers downing their guns on Christmas Day to play football together in the mud of No Man’s Land.

But previously unseen documents show not everyone in the trenches during the truce of 1914 was quite such a good sport.

The 1st Battalion of the Cameronians – formed of men from the tough streets of Glasgow – simply ignored the offer to take part.

Rare find: This recently discovered photograph is one of a haul showing the soldiers of the 1st Cameronians - who refused to shake hands with their German enemies on Christmas Day, 1914

When a German soldier shouted over 
from the opposing trench ‘Tommy, Tommy why you not come across?’ a gruff
 Glaswegian voice replied: ‘Cause we don’t trust you and ye hae been 
four months shooting at us.’

A record of the conversation has been 
released by journalist Andrew Davidson, from memoirs and photographic 
albums compiled by his grandfather Fred, who served as a medical officer
 with the battalion.

Among the documents are Christmas photographs 
which show the Cameronians stayed in their trenches near the northern 
French town of Armentieres.

Mr Davidson, from Kent, said: ‘The 
Cameronians were a bunch of bloody-minded Glaswegians. Even though it 
was Christmas they were pretty grumpy and saw no reason why they should 
play football with people who had been trying to kill them a day 
before.’

An estimated 100,000 men are thought to have taken part in 
the unofficial – and unrepeated – truce along the Western Front, which 
included gift-giving.

Stubborn: Even though it was Christmas the men saw no reason why they should do what some of their colleagues did and play football with people who had been trying to kill them the day before

Instead of emerging from their 
trenches near the northern French town of Armentieres to shake hands 
with the enemy, the Cameronians dug in and did what they could to make 
Christmas Day 99 years ago as memorable as possible.

The
 Christmas photos and exchanges came to light thanks when writer Andrew 
Davidson discovered three battered photograph albums compiled by his 
grandfather, Fred Davidson, who served as a medical officer with the 
regiment during WW1.

The
 soldiers were officially banned from taking cameras into the 
rat-infested trenches, but despite this they took snaps of each other 
to raise their spirits amid the horrors of the daily carnage they were 
witnessing.

Their pocket 
Kodak cameras recorded the grainy snapshots of a regiment that 
had an unequivocal attitude to the Germans embedded nearby - even at 
Christmas.

Fred Davidson, who always carried his camera in his vest pocket, took a set of pictures of the 1st Cameronians that included stretcher bearers and a soldier draped in tinsel as he held a dog by a lead in a trench.

He later captioned the picture of the soldier and dog 'Xmas 1914. Father Xmas in trenches'. Many soldiers kept mongrels they had adopted as strays to keep the rat population under control.

The five stretcher bearers, non of 
them wearing protective helmets, were wrapped up in what they called 
'teddy bears' - goatskin jerkins issued to combat the biting wind.

The
 absence of helmets was down to the lack of equipment supplied to the 
British troops early in the war compared to their German foe who had the
 best and latest military hardware and clothing available.

Painstaking
 research conducted by Andrew Davidson has now resulted in the book 
Fred's War - A Doctor In The Trenches - based on the 250 pictures 
covering 1914 and 1915 as his grandfather served as a 25-year-old doctor
 with the Cameronians.

Contraband: Officially the soldiers were banned from taking cameras into the trenches, although the rule did not stop Fred and his trusty Kodak Vest Pocket camera

Mr Davidson, a 54-year-old journalist 
who lives in Kent, said: 'Basically the Cameronians were a bunch of 
bloody-minded Glaswegians.

'Even
 though it was Christmas they were pretty grumpy and saw no reason why 
they should do what some of their colleagues did and play football with 
people who had been trying to kill them the day before.

'But
 these pictures show real people in real war situations at Christmas. 
The regiment was on it's last day of five days fighting on the front 
line before they were due some time off in the bars and brothels of 
nearby Armentieres on Boxing Day.

'Men love dogs and this one had obviously been left behind by fleeing refugees. The sign around the soldier's neck says something like Happy Noel but it is impossible to read it properly.

'The stretcher bearers picture shows how ill-equipped the British Army was. Non of these men went out into no-man's-land to get their injured mates even under heavy fire wearing helmets. They didn't have them.

'They resemble just a piratical rabble more than British soldiers.'

On Boxing Day the Cameronians were relieved of their front line duties by men of the East Yorkshire regiment and returned to billets in Armentieres for what diaries of the time describe as a 'prolonged alcoholic party.'

Andrew Davidson never knew his grandfather who died two days before he was born. The photo albums had been handed down through the generations.

It was forbidden under Army orders to use cameras while serving on the front line but the commanding officer of the Cameronians knew his men were using the earliest folding Kodak cameras and turned a blind eye.

Fred Davidson was wounded but survived the war as did his unique photos.

Mr Davidson added: 'It was a regiment happy to make its own rules and the officers thought nothing of breaking Army rules.

'Thank goodness they did because we have these wonderful pictures.

'They were a group of men who certainly liked having their pictures taken and it has left a fantastic record of what life was like in the trenches.

'We can look at the picture now and maybe feel blessed that our Christmas will be happy, warm and safe.'
