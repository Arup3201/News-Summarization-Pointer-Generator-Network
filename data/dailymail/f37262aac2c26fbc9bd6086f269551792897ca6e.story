James Taylor was present to sing the national anthem at Game 2 of the World Series in Boston last night - but he began singing the wrong song.

Proving that legendary singer-songwriters sometimes get the words to the national anthem mixed up too, Taylor began singing 'America the Beautiful' instead of 'The Star-Spangled Banner.'

Like the seasoned pro he is, Taylor, 65, quickly recovered, singing, 'O say can you see,' in the very next breath.

'And the game will start with an 0-1 count after that James Taylor swing and miss,' tweeted one viewer after the minor slip-up.

Taylor returned in the seventh inning stretch to sing 'America the Beautiful,' explaining his earlier gaffe.

The second song was in honor of the Boston Marathon bombing victims and survivors.

Taylor, a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee and Boston resident, also performed in honor of Boston bombing victim police officer Sean Collier in April.

Mary J. Blige sang out The Star-Spangled Banner a cappella before Wednesday's World Series kick-off game in Boston.Â

The St Louis Cardinals beat the Boston Red Sox four-two on Thursday.

Being asked to sing the national anthem at a sporting event is an honor for any artist, but they don't always get it right.

Billboard has listed some of the worst performances of all time - a list that puts Taylor's misstep to shame.

Christina Aguilera performed at the Superbowl 2011 and changed the words to the national anthem's fourth line.Michael Bolton in 2003 scrawled the lyrics on his palm when he performed at a Red Sox versus Yankees game making him very unpopular.

And near the top of the list is Roseanne Barr, whose 1990 performance involved crotch-grabbing, off-key yelling and spitting.
