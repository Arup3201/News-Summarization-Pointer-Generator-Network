Middlesbrough's on-loan FA Cup hero Patrick Bamford can see plenty of his Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho in his current manager Aitor Karanka.

Bamford, 21, is enjoying a superb campaign on Teesside, having moved from Stamford Bridge on a season-long deal.

The move was given the full blessing of Mourinho, who had Karanka as his assistant during his time in charge at Real Madrid.

Karanka is now making an impact at the Riverside Stadium, with his Boro side second in the Sky Bet Championship and through to the FA Cup fifth round after a stunning 2-0 win at Manchester City.

England Under-21 international Bamford set Boro on the way to that famous victory at the Etihad Stadium with the opening goal and was asked afterwards if Karanka's methods compared to Mourinho's.

'Yes, definitely,' he said. 'Training is very similar and the big thing is the desire to win. You could see that on Saturday - the passion, every detail is in there.

'He doesn't miss out a thing and he is very rigorous with his approach to every single game, whether it is Manchester City or whoever else we might play.

'Even if it was a lower-league team in the cup, it would be the same approach. It is all about winning.'

Asked if Karanka could then be considered a 'mini Mourinho', Bamford said: 'Yes, I think he is getting there!'

Bamford was highly impressive as Boro took charge of the game in the second half.

The first period had remarkably ended goalless after City spurned a number of chances, although most of them were brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Tomas Mejias.

Bamford's 53rd-minute strike, as Boro pounced on a defensive mix-up, changed the game and Lee Tomlin went close to a second by hitting the post soon after.

Frank Lampard did hit the woodwork late on for City but Kike, made victory certain for the visitors in stoppage time.

Bamford, who has now scored 10 goals this season, hopes his continued good form will eventually result in greater opportunities at Stamford Bridge.

With that in mind, he feels it can only be beneficial that Karanka and Mourinho have such a good relationship.

Bamford said: 'They are always in touch and whenever he speaks the gaffer always says he's had a little chat with him and always makes a joke about it, so it is nice to know that I am in his thoughts.

'I've played against three Premier League teams now - Sunderland, Liverpool and Man City - and I have scored against all of them.

'I think it has shown that I can cut it at the top level, but we'll see what happens.

'I'd say this season is probably too early and I'm out on loan and that is helping me, but next season you never know.'

Bamford began his career at Nottingham Forest but moved to Chelsea in 2012 and has since had loan spells at MK Dons and Derby.

His eight goals for Derby last term helped the Rams into the Championship play-offs, but he regards his display this weekend as his career highlight to date.

He said: 'I can't really put it into words the feeling when I scored the first and especially when we scored the second, even though it wasn't me that scored it... just the relief.

'To win against the champions of England has to be the best result of my career so far and one that all the lads will enjoy.

'It's particularly pleasing being a Chelsea player - so hopefully Chelsea will hear about that!'
