Jean Paul Gaultier loves controversy.

His previous shows have been inspired by the scruffy musician Pete Doherty and have even seen Amy Winehouse lookalikes take to the catwalk.

However, much to the relief of the audience, today's show was a much more glamorous affair.

The French couturier's show was inspired by burlesque dancers, so who better to call upon as a surprise guest than Dita Von Teese?

The perfect fit: Burlesque dancer and model Dita Von Teese was Gaultier's muse in Paris today

The American burlesque dancer and model, 41, graced the catwalk in a risque butterfly-inspired outfit and sexy stockings.

The spectacle was the perfect fit for Dita, who has made retro showgirl style her trademark.

It has been a successful week for Gaultier. It has just been announced that his exhibition, The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier, From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk, is to be shown in his hometown of Paris from April 2015.

On tour since its 2011 premiere at a Montreal museum, the show has travelled to Dallas, San Francisco, Madrid, Rotterdam and New York.

Its next stop, in April, is at the Barbican in London but the exhibition has not yet been seen in Gaultierâ€™s home town, Paris.

The exhibition has smashed fashion exhibition records with its millionth visitor, surpassing the near 700,000 visitors to Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty, shown at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2011.
