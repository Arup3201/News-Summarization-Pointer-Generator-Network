An ex-soldier accused of murdering a Gold Coast nightclub singer said he had no choice but to kill the man in revenge for the rape of his girlfriend, a court has heard.

Matthew Cox, 27, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Sex 'N' Chocolate singer Tony Williams in his Mermaid Waters unit on December 23, 2011.

Crown Prosecutor David Meredith told the Brisbane Supreme Court that Cox tracked down Mr Williams and violently bashed him to death with a hammer, believing his girlfriend had once been raped by the singer and borne his child.

The New Zealand-born victim's battered body was found on the floor of his lounge room the next day.

The prosecutor said Cox's girlfriend, Sarah Davis, had a son believed to be Mr Williams' child who was the product of a casual sexual relationship with the singer and the hospital orderly.

Some non-consensual sexual activity had once taken place, but Cox had been led to believe Mr Williams had raped Ms Davis in a one-off encounter that left her pregnant, Mr Meredith said.

In early December 2011 Cox contacted friend and former soldier Joshua Middleton and allegedly said: 'I have something important and any man worth his weight would help me out on this one.'

Mr Meredith said Cox wanted to make Mr Williams pay.

'I should put him in a wheelchair or kill him. What shall I do?' Cox allegedly asked Mr Middleton.

When his friend asked if it had to be 'so drastic' Cox is said to have replied 'It has to be done'.

Mr Meredith said Cox posed as a postman to gain entry to Mr Williams' unit before bashing him to death with a hammer, leaving blood smeared across the walls of the unit.

Mr Middleton disposed of the evidence.

The prosecutor said though Cox claimed he killed Mr Williams in self defence after confronting the singer over the alleged rape, there was evidence he'd taken gloves to Mr Williams' unit.

'If you were going to confront someone ... then you don't need to hide the fact that you're present,' Mr Meredith said.

'You don't need gloves. Gloves you might think hide the fact that you're there.'

The trial is expected to run for up to 12 days.
