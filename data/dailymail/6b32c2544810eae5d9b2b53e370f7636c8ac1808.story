The computers look more like leftover props from a 1970s Bond film than a state-of-the-art mainframe that can shoot a missile into outer space.

But this is the nerve centre where North Korean scientists will oversee the launch of a long-range rocket that they say will jettison a satellite into orbit.

The take off, believed to be imminent and would be in direct contravention of UN resolutions, has spread alarm across the world as fears grow that the missile could also be used to carry a nuclear warhead capable of striking America.

Fighter jets roared through the skies over downtown Pyongyang today as an American official told ABC News that the launch is expected to happen within the next 24 to 48 hours.

He said, judging by the amount of fuel the North Koreans have pumped into the rocket, the trajectory could be very long - expected to fly south over the Philippines, jettison its satellite payload and splash into waters near Australia.

David Cameron said he regarded the prospective firing as a breach of UN edicts.

'We need to send a very clear message to the North Korean leadership,' he told BBC Radio 5Live. 'They are not even able to feed their own people and yet they seem to be able to put satellites in the sky.

'They have a very clear choice. This regime needs to take a different path if it wants to be able to engage with the world.'

The launch window opened during a week aimed at 
celebrating Sunday's centennial of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the 
country's late founder. Events also include high-level meetings where 
new leader Kim Jong Un has received at least three new titles to further
cement his rule.

North Korea had told international organizations that its rocket launch would come between Thursday and Monday, between 7 a.m. and noon local time.

Poor weather made a Thursday launch unlikely, Philippine disaster managemment agency chief Benito Ramos said, citing an assessment passed on to him by the Philippine military, which is being briefed by U.S. and Japan counterparts. Wind in particular can scuttle rocket launches.

North Koreans woke to details about 
developments at a Workers' Party conference where leader Kim Jong Un 
ascended to top posts and brought with him a new generation of 
officials.

His father, Kim 
Jong Il, was granted the posthumous title of 'eternal general secretary'
at the special one-day party conference Wednesday.

The immortalization of the late leader
provided a glimpse into how North Korea will handle the nation's second
hereditary succession and indicates he will be honored much in the same
way his father, Kim Il Sung, was made 'eternal president' following his
1994 death.

Footage on 
state TV on Thursday showed Kim Jong Un seated at the front of the 
conference with white statues of his grandfather and a new statue of his
father in his trademark khaki work ensemble, one arm on his hip.

On Mansu Hill, once the domain of a huge bronze statue of Kim Il Sung, a second covered statue awaits its unveiling.

In 2009, a similar launch from an east coast site took place on the sec ond day of a five-day window.

The
United States, Japan, Britain and others say the launch would 
constitute a provocation and would violate U.N. Security Council 
resolutions banning North Korea from developing its nuclear and missile 
programs.

Experts say the Unha-3 carrier is 
similar to the type of rocket that could be used to fire a missile 
mounted with a nuclear warhead to strike the U.S. or other targets.

The
launch and Kim's formal ascension to top posts comes during a week of 
events leading up to celebrations Sunday marking the 100th anniversary 
of the birth of his grandfather, late President Kim Il Sung.

The
centennial is a major milestone in the nation Kim founded in 1948, and 
the streets of the capital, Pyongyang, were awash with new posters, 
banners and the national flag.

The streets were busy with women clad in traditional Korean dresses and children waving red flags.

The
Taedong River flyover of fighter jets was practice for a military 
parade, officials said. North Korea's army celebrates its 80th 
anniversary later this month.

The expected satellite launch is one of the marquee events this week.

North
Korean space officials call the launch of the Unha-3 rocket, mounted 
with an Earth observation satellite, a 'gift' to Kim Il Sung.

They said Wednesday that the final 
step of injecting fuel into the three-stage rocket was under way in the 
coastal hamlet of Tongchang-ri.

'We
are injecting fuel as we speak,' Paek Chang Ho, chief of the space 
committee's General Command Center, told reporters given a chance 
Wednesday to visit the control center outside Pyongyang.

He said the rocket was ready for liftoff as soon as engineers are given the green light.

North
Korea has informed international aviation, maritime and 
telecommunications authorities that the launch will take place between 
Thursday and Monday.

Because liquid rocket fuel is highly 
volatile and corrosive, its injection into the rocket is usually one of 
the final steps in the pre-launch process, experts say. But the weather,
and particularly the wind, could force delays.Â 

An
analysis of recent satellite images shows preparations appear compete, 
the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced 
International Studies said.

Images
taken by a commercial satellite earlier in the week revealed increased 
activity at an instrumentation site that would track and collect data 
from the rocket to be passed to the launch control center.

A mobile radar tracking antenna also was removed from its stowed position, indicating it has been checked out for operations.

The
analysis for the institute's website, 38 North, also says a mobile 
optical system appears to have been set up to track the rocket's flight.

The
planned launch was a focus of discussions among foreign ministers from 
the Group of Eight leading industrialized democracies.

'I think we all share a strong 
interest in stability on the Korean peninsula, and we will be discussing
how best to achieve that as well,' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton told her colleagues Wednesday in Washington.

Paek
denied Wednesday that the launch was anything but a peaceful civilian 
bid to send a satellite into space. He said the Kwangmyongsong-3 
satellite is designed to send back images and data that will be used for
weather forecasts and agricultural surveys.

'Some parties insist our peaceful 
space program is a missile test,' he told foreign reporters given an 
exclusive tour of the nation's main satellite command center.

'We
don't really care what the outside world thinks. This launch is 
critical to developing our space program and improving our economy.'

This
satellite launch would be the country's third attempt since 1998. Two 
previous rockets, also named Unha, were mounted with experimental 
communications satellites and sent from the east coast.

'The launch of the Kwangmyongsong-3 
satellite is the pride of our nation and of our people,' Rim Kwang 
Myong, a mathematics major at Kim Il Sung University, told The 
Associated Press.

Science 
and technology also are said to be Kim Jong Un's areas of expertise, and
Kim is credited with giving guidance during the last launch in 2009.

Kim
is considered supreme commander of the armed forces, and is expected to
gain other new titles formalizing his position as 'supreme leader' of 
North Korea's people and party, possibly including his father's title of
chairman of the National Defense Commission.

On Wednesday, he was made first 
secretary of the Workers' Party, a newly created post. He also succeeded
his late father as chairman of the Central Military Commission, which 
formulates the party's military policies, and was elevated to standing 
member of the powerful Political Bureau, a high-level decision-making 
body.

Party delegates also 
elected a new generation of younger officials to key posts, including 
Choe Ryong Hae, a new vice marshal who will join Kim on the powerful 
Presidium of the Central Committee's Political Bureau.

Ken
Gause, a North Korea specialist at CNA, a U.S.-based research 
organization, said younger members also were promoted at the last party 
conference in September 2010, when Kim Jong Un was made vice chairman of
the Central Military Commission.

'I expect in the near future, as Kim Jong Un begins to consolidate his power, we will see more,' he said in an email interview.

Six
other people were named to the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee, including Jang Song Thaek, who is married to Kim Jong Il's 
sister, Kim Kyong Hui.
