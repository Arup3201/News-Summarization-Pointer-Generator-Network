Manchester City go into Wednesday night's Champions League game against Barcelona knowing that only a win - and a win in which they score twice - will be enough to secure progress.

It might therefore worry them to know that beating Barcelona is something that their manager, Manuel Pellegrini, has failed to manage since 2008.

Pellegrini has now managed three clubs without any successes against Barca, losing all of his games so far as manager of City to match his record at Real Madrid, and managing just a single draw when in charge of Malaga.

The last time Pellegrini beat Barcelona, in 2008, Yaya Toure was playing for the Spanish club

In fact, you have to go back to March 2008, more than eight years ago, to find Pellegrini's last win over Barcelona, on a day that his star man Yaya Toure was lining up for the Nou Camp outfit.

As Villarreal boss Pellegrini did manage four wins against Barca, while drawing three times and losing the remaining five of his twelve games. 

However, only the last of those wins came away from home, and none of them in the Champions League, while his career record against Barcelona sees him triumph only 16 per cent of the time.

City know they need to produce something special to progress - if they do beat Luis Enrique's team by the required margin, it will not just be a remarkable achievement for the club, but also for their manager.
