The England national football squad were among sports teams across the country to pay tribute on Tuesday morning to the millions of servicemen and women that have died in conflict since the start of the First World War.

The senior squad, flanked by the Under-21s, 20s, 19s and blind squads, took to the field to pay their respects at St George's Park.

Wayne Rooney and Roy Hodgson led the senior side delegation and were joined by military personnel representing all three services from RAF Shawbury and the Defence Helicopter Flying School in Shropshire.

This remembrance period is particularly poignant given it is a century since the start of the First World War and the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.

As part of the Football Association's Armistice Day commemorations, Hodgson and England Under-21s manager Gareth Southgate will go with a group of players to lay wreaths at the Armed Forces Memorial on Tuesday afternoon.

The players stood behind a board reading 'Football Remembers' for the two-minute silence at 11am, which saw the senior squad reconvene shortly after finishing training.

The England rugby union team also stood at their Pennyhill Park training base in Bagshot to observe the silence.

Scotland's rugby union team gathered at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh for Tuesday morning's remembrance service. 

In Cardiff, the Wales national football manager Chris Coleman stood alongside his players and staff in tribute.
