One million worshippers from all over the world have gathered in Rome ahead of the ‘unprecedented’ double canonisation of two former popes.

Over the last 24 hours, crowds have arrived and camped out in Vatican City ahead of the canonisation of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII at St Peter’s Square.

The ceremony, to be held later today, will be an unprecedented event in Catholic history, as two living Popes will be in attendance – the current Pope Francis I and Benedict XVI, who stood down last year and now holds the title Pope Emeritus.

Former pontiff John Paul II is due to be canonised alongside John XXIII, who was Pope from 1958-1963, in a ceremony which is expected to be watched by millions of people around the world.

For the past year Benedict has largely dedicated himself to prayer in a monastery in the Vatican grounds. It means today’s ceremony will be his highest-profile appearance since he retired.

Francis, who lives in a guesthouse elsewhere in Vatican City, has been quite welcoming to his predecessor, occasionally paying a call on Benedict.

It was Francis who sought to include Benedict in the ceremony, which is expected to draw crowds of more than one million tourists and pilgrims.

Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi explained Benedict's involvement, saying he will be in St. Peter's Square for the canonisation of John and John Paul, where he will 'concelebrate' the Mass with Francis and other cardinals.

'Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI has accepted the invitation, and has let Pope Francis know that he will be present tomorrow morning at the canonization ceremony and will concelebrate' along with other prelates, Lombardi said.

'That doesn't mean that he will go up on the altar' on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica, Lombardi said of the outdoor Mass.

Preparations were well underway on Saturday for the canonisation of John Paul II and John XXIII in what will be an unprecedented event in Catholic history

Hundreds of thousands of people descended on Vatican City on Saturday to ensure they had a prime position for the canonisation which will take place in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican later today

Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Benedict - Pope Francis's predecessor - will be in St. Peter's Square for the canonisation of John and John Paul

He noted that during the ceremony, cardinals and bishops will be seated on one side of the esplanade, with, presumably, Benedict, among them.

'We will all be happy to have his presence' at the ceremony, the Vatican spokesman said.

Benedict also attended Francis' ceremony to elevate churchmen to cardinal's rank in February.

But that ceremony wasn't a Mass, meaning Sunday's appearance by two popes would be the first Mass concelebrated by two pontiffs, one reigning and the other retired.

As German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Benedict presided over John Paul II's funeral in the square in 2005.

He was soon elected pontiff himself, going on to lead the ceremony to beatify his Polish-born predecessor in 2011, also in the square.

It was John Paul who, early in his papacy, appointed the German prelate to a key Vatican post in charge of safeguarding church teaching, and eventually, also dealing with the mounting cases of sexual abuse of minors by priests in the United States and elsewhere.

Benedict has a connection to John XXII's papacy as well. As a young theologian, he attended the Second Vatican Council, the gathering of prelates from around the globe that the Italian pope set up as a way to bring modernizing reforms to the Catholic church.

On Saturday, pilgrims were pouring into Rome in big groups or as individual families or travellers, eager to be among those taking their place in the square before dawn on the day of the ceremony.

Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said an estimated one million people were expected to flood into Rome for the event.

Working to ensure the crowds are safe, authorities were deploying about 3,500 extra police officers in Rome, beefing up the total to around 10,000 officers.

Police were also trying to keep faithful from being ripped off. Italy's customs and tax police cracked down on vendors selling counterfeit merchandise, confiscating 1,500 boxes of rosaries resembling the ones that Pope Francis had distributed free to faithful in St. Peter's Square in November.

The boxes resemble packets of pills, in line with Francis' description of the rosary prayer as 'spiritual medicine'.

The tax police also handed out fines to 23 establishments that were billing themselves as bed-and-breakfast lodgings for pilgrims, even though they lacked the proper authorization to rent out rooms.

Abuse victims of Catholic priests have said that former Pope John Paul II does not deserve to be made a saint because of his failure to bring perpetrators to justice during his reign.

John Paul, who was head of the Catholic church from 1978 until his death in 2005, 'enabled wrongdoing' and was more interested in protecting the Church's reputation than helping victims, according to campaigners.

Barbara Blaine, the president of the Survivors' Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), spoke out against John Paul today.

Mrs Blaine told the Daily Telegraph: 'It’s time for the Vatican to stop honouring those who enabled wrongdoing. Thousands of victims were abused because John Paul refused to read the reports he was receiving.'

It was John Paul who, early in his papacy, appointed the German prelate to a key Vatican post in charge of safeguarding church teaching, and eventually, also dealing with the mounting cases of sexual abuse of minors by priests in the United States and elsewhere

Nicky Davis, a 50-year-old from Australia who was abused, said: 'We don’t believe it’s saintly behaviour to allow sex abuse to continue for a 27-year reign. He could have used his enormous power to save children but instead he decided to save the reputation of the Church.'

The organisation also published an open letter on their website to other abuse victims. It said: 'At best, [John Paul] turned a blind eye to clergy sexual crimes and cover-ups. At worst, he perpetuated and approved them.

'For him to now be given the highest honor in the church rubs even more salt into the already deep and still fresh wounds of thousands of struggling victims and millions of betrayed Catholics and victims.

'For all of you who are upset because of this callous sainthood decision and celebration, we want you to know that you are not alone.'
