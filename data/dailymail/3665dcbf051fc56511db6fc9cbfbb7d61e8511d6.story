David Cameron's spokesman has claimed
'severe weather conditions' causing delays to flights was partly to 
blame for the massive queues at Heathrow Airport.

The Government is poised to make a 
Commons emergency statement on the chaotic queues at immigration in the 
London airport, with the Olympics looming just ahead.

Speaker John Bercow has granted an urgent question to the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, Keith Vaz.

Problem: Boris Johnson expressed 'serious concern' over Heathrow, while 
David Cameron claimed the disruption was partly down to severe weather 
causing delays

London Mayor Boris Johnson also expressed 'serious concern' about the problem at Heathrow, in a letter to the Home Secretary today.

He said the huge queues at 
immigration gave 'a terrible impression of the UK' and it was 
unfortunate that the country’s main port of entry was 'gaining such a 
poor reputation'.

Mr 
Johnson told Theresa May he was looking forward to 'hearing what 
measures the Home Office and the UK Border Agency plan to take in order 
to rectify the situation both for the [Olympic] Games and for usual 
passenger numbers'.

The
Prime Minister's spokesman told a regular daily press briefing in Westminster: 'There 
have been some queues over recent days, caused by a number of factors 
including late planes and changes of schedules.

'We
have to make sure we don't do anything to compromise border security 
but equally we need to make sure that there is a regular flow and 
passengers are able to flow through the border in a reasonable way.

Airlines and airport bosses fear Heathrow, which handles about 190,000 passengers a day, will be unable to cope with the millions visiting Britain for the Olympics and Diamond Jubilee

'The Border Force is in constant 
dialogue with BAA about passenger flow and is planning its resources 
accordingly. The Home Secretary is going to meet the British Air 
Transport Association (Bata) to discuss the steps Border Force are 
taking.

'Our objective 
is to keep disruption to a minimum while at the same time making sure 
border security is not jeopardised in any way.'

Asked
whether the Prime Minister was confident Border Force had sufficient 
manpower to process passengers at Heathrow, Mr Cameron's spokesman 
responded: 'It is not purely about staff numbers.

'It
is about how you deploy your resources effectively and better 
management of those resources, better prioritisation of those 
resources.'

Big issue: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt leaves his London home carrying the press summary that describes him as 'troubled' over Heathrow

Plans
are in place to deal with the expected increase in travellers coming 
into the UK for this summer's London Olympics, said the spokesman.

This could include retired border staff 
returning to work for the period and trained staff being brought in from
other parts of the UK Border Agency or Government departments such as 
the Home Office and HM Revenue & Customs.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt was seen leaving his London home today carrying a press summary note that referred to his concerns over Heathrow.

The minister, who has been put on probation over 'inappropriate' emails between his adviser and Rupert Murdoch, was photographed holding a document prepared by a private company for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.

It said the 'the readiness of Heathrow' was the issue that 'troubled' Mr Hunt.

A top border official has sent an email to Heathrow Airport staff berating them for encouraging passengers to complain over huge queues at immigration control.

The email orders airport operator BAA to stop handing out ‘inflammatory’ leaflets to passengers apologising for the ‘very long delays’ of up to several hours.

It also instructs them to stop passengers taking pictures of the queues.

The length of queues for arrivals at 
border control has caused increasing anger, with reports of some 
passengers storming through because they have grown so furious at the 
delays.

Airport operator BAA has tried to 
defuse tensions with a leaflet apologising for the problems, saying that
people arriving in the country ‘deserved a warmer welcome’ and 
explaining how to complain to the Home Office.

But Marc Owen, director of Border 
Force operations at Heathrow, has told BAA that the leaflets are 
‘inappropriate’ and that ministers would take ‘a very dim view’.

In an email obtained by the Daily 
Telegraph, he said: ‘The leaflet... is both inflammatory and likely to 
increase tensions in arrivals halls, especially in the current 
atmosphere.

‘It is inappropriate in that it is not for you to display how to complain on our behalf.

‘Please refrain from handing out (the 
leaflets) or I will escalate (the matter) with ministers who are likely 
to take a very dim view. I know there are copies in the hall and your 
troops are ready with them.’

Mr Owen also told BAA to prevent 
frustrated passengers taking pictures in the arrivals hall, after photos
of lengthy queues were posted on Twitter.

Stretched: The document suggested the readiness of Heathrow was a big topic for the Culture Secretary

Former transport minister Jim 
Fitzpatrick, Labour’s aviation spokesman, said: ‘This is a pure 
cover-up. I can understand people wanting to take pictures of the 
queues. This is further evidence of Border Force trying to hide the 
severity of the problem.

‘Passengers need to know how to register complaints and for Border Force to try to prevent them doing so is outrageous.’

In a joint statement issued last 
night, Border Force and BAA said: ‘The majority of passengers pass 
through immigration control quickly but there are sometimes delays at 
airports for a range of reasons. We think it’s important passengers are 
given the full picture.

‘We will not compromise border security but we will work together to keep delays to a minimum.’

Labour’s immigration spokesman Chris 
Bryant said: ‘The Government is in danger of scoring an extraordinary 
double own goal, undermining our border security and giving a chaotic 
first impression of the UK.

'No airport in the world is designed to keep 
thousands of people waiting to get through passport control. May and [Immigration Minister] Damian Green need 
urgently to make resources available so that the events of this week are
not repeated.

‘The Home Secretary... needs to avoid chaos at our borders come the Summer, the Olympic Games and thereafter.’

Retired immigration officers will be brought back to ease airport border control queues during the Olympics, it was reported today.

Passport checkpoint veterans will return to duty over the summer to cope with the extra visitors set to descend on south east terminals.

The Sunday Telegraph reported the Border Force, an agency of the Home Office, planned to spend £2.5 million bringing back ex-members of staff who will receive travel expenses, be given hotel accommodation and paid allowances of up to £30 an hour.

The row comes after several incidents 
of angry passengers storming past border guards at Britain’s airports in
frustration at queues.

On Wednesday, a frustrated Spanish 
passenger at Heathrow barged through passport control, but was 
intercepted by counter-terrorism officers. But last month, about 20 
passengers stormed border control at Birmingham Airport after a two-hour
wait. Hotelier Alan Fitzpatrick described how holidaymakers made ‘a 
dash for it, pushing Border Agency staff aside’. He added: ‘There were 
scuffles, people being knocked to the ground and then resignation from 
the powers that be, who stepped aside to let the crowd through.’

The Home Office admitted border controls had been breached but said passengers subsequently had their passports checked.

On Thursday, police were deployed at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 when a group of Americans began shouting at border staff.

At one terminal last week there were just three passport staff on duty for EU arrivals, and another three for non-EU nationals.

The trouble has been caused by the reintroduction of full passport checks following controversy over their relaxation last year.
