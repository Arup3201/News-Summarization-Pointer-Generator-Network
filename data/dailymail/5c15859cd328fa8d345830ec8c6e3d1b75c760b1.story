The model and actress, pictured here at London's Debenham House in 2006, is alleged to have punched a police officer

Former supermodel Paula Hamilton has been charged with punching a policeman in the chest, it was revealed today.

The star is already facing a drink-driving court case following a crash near her Buckinghamshire home three weeks before the latest incident.

After the crash the 51-year-old ex-model alleged she was bitten by a police dog which tracked her from the wreckage of her car found embedded in a neighbour’s conservatory.

Hamilton has now been charged with attacking Police constable Dominic Matheson after he answered a 999 call reporting a domestic disturbance at the model’s home on September 29.

Officers from Thames Valley Police had rushed to Hamilton’s home in a private road at Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, after the report claiming there was a domestic disturbance.

It was understood that PC Matheson was investigating the complaint when he was allegedly punched in the chest by Hamilton, who was bizarrely clutching a sunflower in the other hand.

The officer was not seriously hurt but Hamilton was subsequently arrested, interviewed and charged with assaulting a police officer.

The ex-supermodel was the face of Volkswagen cars when she starred in a blockbuster advertising campaign in the 1980s which made her a household name.

She hit the headlines again in mid-September when police were called to a crash near her home on September 4 and found her Hyundai Coupe car which had veered off the road, hit a telegraph police and demolished a fence before crashing into a neighbour’s newly-built glass conservatory.

A mystery young man found injured and sitting in the passenger seat was taken to hospital as police searched for the driver who had vanished from the scene.

She was found by a police dog in a nearby garden, having lost her two front teeth in the accident.

The eccentric model later complained to police that she had been bitten by the police dog although it was understood no further action was taken.

Police confirmed last week that proceedings had been issued against Hamilton in relation to the accident and that she had been summonsed for alleged drink-driving. She was understood to be awaiting a court appearance date.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police confirmed today that, following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, Hamilton had been charged with assaulting Police constable Matheson in relation to a domestic disturbance on September 29.

'A 51-year-old woman from Farnham Common has been charged with assault on a police officer on September 29 and released on bail to appear in court,' the spokesman said.A courts’ service spokesman confirmed that Hamilton had denied the charge at High Wycombe Magistrates’ Court and was due to face trial at Aylesbury Magistrates’ Court in February.
