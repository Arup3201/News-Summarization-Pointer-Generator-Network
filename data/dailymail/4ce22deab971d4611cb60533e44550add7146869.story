 A Philadelphia police officer has been pulled off the streets after a video showing him bullying kids emerged - days after he was caught on camera interrogating a man for speaking to his neighbour.

The short clip shows Philip Nace of the 25th District knock over and break a basketball hoop in the street before telling two kids witnessing the act to 'Have a good day', while his partner adds: 'Jesus loves you'.

It comes after the 46-year-old was secretly recorded in a confronting scene with two men who stopped in the road to speak to someone.

Philadelphia police officer Philip Nace has been downgraded to admin duties after a video showing him knocking over this basketball hoop was uploaded to Youtube

Driving off, Officer Nace told the kids videoing the incident to 'have a good day' while his partner added: 'Jesus loves you'

Nace appears to threaten violence, use
 derogatory language and accuse the men of being drug dealers in the 
16-minute video, which was uploaded to YouTube.

Lt.
 John Stanford, of the Philadelphia Police Department, said Nace has 
been downgraded to 'administrative duties' and an internal investigation
 would determine what disciplinary action would be taken.

'It's
 not something that's going to be tolerated,' he told philly.com. 'The 
fact that a second video was brought to our attention, there are 
obviously some issues here.'

The
 latest video, titled 'Bully cop police officer Philip Nace from Philly 
on Youtube again' was filmed by a 21-year-old, who asked not to be named
 for fear the officer would retaliate.

He said: 'He comes out here and harasses people all the time... Nace is a bully.'

In the recording he is heard to say: 'This is what the police do around here. They harass us.'

But Lt. Stanford said he hopes the actions of one individual will not impact negatively on the whole force.

He added: 'We've
 made some valiant efforts to build better relationships with all 
communities in this city. This definitely puts a strain on that.

'But
 this is one individual. Don't let this individual put it in your mind 
that this is how officers act. The vast majority of officers give the 
residents of this city 110 per cent.' 

We don't want you here anyway': Two police officers in Northern Philadelphia have been secretly caught on camera detaining and interrogating two men for saying hello to someone in the street

Candid: A man secretly films his friend being detained after two police officers in Northern Philadelphia tell him: 'You can't say hi to strangers.'

Two police officers in Northern Philadelphia have been secretly caught on camera detaining and interrogating two men for saying hello to someone in the street

The first video - purportedly taken on September 27 - is called 'Police unlawful harassment and racial profiling,' but the race of the two pedestrians is unclear.

It
 starts as two officers in the suburbs of Northern Philadelphia pull up 
next to two men asking them why they were talking to another man on the 
street.

One of the men starts to record the encounter on his cellphone seconds later.

Officer Nace gets out of his car and approaches, saying: 'You don't say hi to strangers.'

As
 the situation unfolds, with the men arguing they have done nothing 
wrong, the phone - now sitting on the hood of the police car - picks up a
 voice-only recording of the officers attempting to explain they are 
within their rights to stop and search whomever they want.

They
 claim to have saw the men jaywalk and say they 'may' have received a 
call for a robbery involving two men of their description.

Officer Nace: 'You asked me why I stopped you, I said how you know we didn't get a radio call/ You're looking at it from where you are, but you're not looking at it from where we are. You don't know what we know or what we got information on, right? Right? What - you don't hear now?'

Man: 'You accusing me of robbing someone?'

Officer Nace: 'I didn't accuse you of anything, can you hear? I said we could have got a call that somebody wearing the clothes that you're wearing just robbed someone, that's why we stopped you, so is that wrong of us?'

Officer Nace also threatens violence, saying: 'Don't f***ing play though, you'll be on the same f***ing block as him. We'll kick your ass too.'

Approach: Officer Phillip Nace is at the centre of the video, which is gaining major traffic online

This is the moment where both police officers appear to grab one man

At another point officer Nace is also heard saying: 'You're gonna be in violation if you keep running your mouth when I split your wig open.'

The two officers then discuss arresting the men simply because they don't like them.

'You should take that one just for his friggin' big mouth,' one cop says.

'Well they crossed the street on a red light, so...' the other replies.

Later in the video, the cops begin making derogatory comments and taunting one of the men.

'Well then don't come to f***ing Philadelphia, stay in Jersey,' one says.

'I have family out here,' the man replies.

'Yeah well then don't come over here, we don't want you here anyway, all you do is weaken the f***ing country,' the officer hits back.

'Yeah? I weaken the country? How I weaken the country? By working?'

'No, freeloading.'

When the man explains he works as a server at a country club, the cop replies: 'Serving weed?'

A police spokesperson told the Daily News that internal affairs is investigating the incident and that that the investigation, not the video, would determine the outcome. 

Last year, Lt. Jonathan Josey was fired after a YouTube video went viral
 of him punching a woman in the face and knocking her to the ground.

Lt. Jonathon has since returned to the job.
