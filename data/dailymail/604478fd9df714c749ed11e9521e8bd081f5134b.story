Two young women who had been best friends since the age of four tragically lost their lives together this week when they were killed in a horror car crash.

Jani von Wielligh, from Adelaide in South Australia, and Natasha Strydom, from Waiuku in Auckland, were road-tripping across New Zealand when an oncoming car drifted across the centre line and into their vehicle.

The women, both 20, were driving along the State Highway 25 near Thames in Waitakaruru and Kopu, about 100 kilometres south-east of Auckland.

Fanie Strydom, Natasha's father told the NZ Herald the women had stopped into the Strydom family home in Waiuku on Tuesday before the crash.

Jani and Natasha had been friends since they attended kindergarten in South Africa together as children, and stayed in touch when their families emigrated to Adelaide and Waiuku respectively.

'They kept in touch all the way through and visited back and forward,' Mr Strydom told the NZ Herald.

'They were both the most amazing and loving girls. They were such an example of a good, perfect friendship.'

The best friends were headed to Palmerston North to visit Natasha's university and check out where she was living.

The best friends had been road-tripping across New Zealand and had stopped in at Natasha's family home just hours before the accident

Jani's father Erich von Wielligh also spoke of the strong relationship the two women shared.

'They were friends from kindergarten and we moved to Australia, and the Strydom family moved to New Zealand, but we kept contact and the girls were always visiting each other on holidays.' 

On Wednesday Natasha's mother shared a touching tribute to her young daughter alongside a family picture which shows the whole family beaming.

'Thank you God for the best twenty years of my life!, Charmaine Strydom wrote.

Tributes also flowed from friends and family of the girls, with one woman writing on Mrs Strydom's page: '...my heart is broken for you and the parents of this other precious girl - these two precious jewels are now in another heaven.'

Tributes have poured in for the young women, who had been the best of friends since they were four

The driver of the other car was taken to hospital where she remains in a critical but stable condition

'Two beautiful young girls - gone to heaven. We are grieving with you and remembering all the wonderful years you've had together,' another friend posted.

The driver of the other car involved in the fatal accident was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but has since stabilised.

Waikato District Road Policing Manager Inspector Dana McDonald said the Serious Crash Unit was still investigating the crash to find out the exact nature of it. 

'Initial indications are the west-bound Volkswagen car appears to have crossed the centre line and collided with the Mazda in the east-bound lane,' she said, according to Stuff.co.nz.

Speed and alcohol have been ruled out as factors in the crash, Ms McDonald also revealed.
