A teenage girl has spoken of how she desperately tried to save her boyfriend as he drowned while they were swimming across a river after he had an asthma attack.

Central Valley High School student Jansen Badinger died in the Spokane River, Washington, last week. His girlfriend Alaina Bates said she did as much as she could to save him but her efforts proved fruitless.

'I did everything I could. I tried to 
get him on my back, I tried to get him to hold my leg and he just 
physically could not do anything,' she said.

Tragic death: Central Valley High School student Jansen Badinger died in the Spokane River, Washington, last week after suffering from an asthma attack mid swim

His girlfriend Alaina Bates tried to save him but could not: 'I did everything I could. I tried to get him on my back, I tried to get him to hold my leg and he just physically could not do anything'

A friend said of Jansen: 'He'd always know how to pick people up when they're down, make them laugh if they're sad and he was an easy person to get along with. He cared about everyone'

'But when he 
couldn't do anything his face was calm and he wasn't scared. That's the 
type of guy he was, always smiling, and full of hope,'  she told KHQ.

'Everyone remembers his beautiful smile. It was so genuine and contagious and wow, he could really make you laugh.'

The couple had already swam across the river once and were on their way back when the current grew stronger. Alaina believes his asthma attack may have been stress-induced.

'It happened and I can remember everything so vividly but at the same time it doesn't feel like he's gone,' she told KXLY.com.

Witnesses pulled Jansen out of the water and started CPR but it was too late.

Jansen was an extremely popular student at the school and touched so many lives, Alain's father Charlie Bates said.

'They loved him dearly. He had the world at his fingertips. I don't think he's ever said a
bad word about anybody. He wanted to make a difference.

'He changed peoples lives and people didn't even know it.'

Scene: Jansen and Alaina had already swam across the Spokane River. It was on their way back that tragedy struck and the 18-year-old had an asthma attack

Remembered: Hundreds of students from Central Valley High School attended a candle-lit memorial for the popular and beloved teen after his death

Popular: When Jansen graduated last month he was voted 'Most Likely To Bleed Blue' in recognition of his school spirit. He wanted to be a firefighter and a teacher

When he graduated last month he was voted 'Most Likely To Bleed Blue' in recognition of his school spirit. He wanted to be a firefighter and a teacher.

The Spokesman Review wrote a touching tribute to the 18-year-old after his death, revealing that - as a keen sportsman - he mentored younger children.

Outside of high school, sports also played a significant role in Jansen's life, and he often mentored younger children.

He played with the FC Soccer Club for four years, said Stephen Brown, his coach. Jansen also used to help younger players during soccer camps.

'I really don’t think the kid had a bad bone in his body,' the coach said. 'The kind of kid you want to have around. He was a people’s person.

'It’s tragic, it really is. Sometimes you question why this happens to good people.
