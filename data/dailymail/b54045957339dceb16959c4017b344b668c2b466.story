Two sisters and their friend have died in a wrong-way crash on the same stretch of a Florida highway that has claimed seven other lives this year. 

Gabrielle Lanier, 33, was driving her sister Lakritra, 31, and their friend John Pierson, 26, south on the northbound lane of I-275 in Tampa on Sunday morning when they collided head-on with a semitrailer truck carrying petroleum. All three were killed, although the other driver was not injured.

The sisters, who lived together, leave behind nine children, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

The crash was the fourth wrong-way crash on the road over the past year. Before the tragedy, seven others died in collisions, even though the Florida Highway Patrol insists the road is clearly marked.

Authorities said Gabrielle, a mother of four, was likely  driving the wrong way on the road for about two minutes when she smashed into the truck driven by  Michael Kellogg, 50, at 6am on Sunday.

Both vehicles came to a rest in the northbound lanes with debris scattered across the road.

No oil leaked from the struck semi. 

Gabrielle had a number of traffic violations through the years, including driving with a suspended license, and authorities continue to investigate if alcohol or drugs played a role, the Times said. 

'It's hard,' Lakritra's ex-husband, Zebadiah Lanier, told the Tampa Bay Times. 'Everybody's trying to digest and really grasp what really happened.'

Tragic: They were in this Honda as it drove the wrong way onto I-275 and crashed head-on with a truck. It is the fourth wrong-way collision on the stretch of road since February and this one brings the death toll to 10

Elaine Pierson called her son, John fun-loving.

'John was a good boy,' she said. 'He loved his family and we loved him.'

The crash is the fourth fatal wrong-way crash at the spot since February, when four USF students were killed by a wrong-way driver.

Two weeks later, another person was killed as they drove the wrong way and in July, another wrong-way driver died near 5th Avenue North.  

But authorities said the roads were properly marked.

'There are wrong way signs especially at the ramps,' Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Steve Gaskins said.

Scene: The driver of the trailer, left, walked away without any injuries. Authorities are looking into whether drugs or alcohol played a part in the crash and insisted the road is properly marked

'Up and down the interstates especially since they have the reflectors on the roadway so if you're travelling opposing traffic you're seeing a lot of red signals.'

He added that the three previous crashes involved drugs or alcohol. 

Zach Morales, who lost a friend on the highway a few years ago, said something needs to be changed.  

'If there is signage there, they have to think about where it's placed at because obviously people aren't seeing it,' Morales told WTSP. 'Even if you're a drunk driver you'd think that seeing a sign would help.'
