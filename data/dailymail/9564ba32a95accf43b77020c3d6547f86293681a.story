A retired couple missed out on a trip to France for the Christmas markets after a coach company printed the wrong time of departure on their tickets.

Derek and Moira Pearce, who are both retired schoolteachers from Gloucestershire, booked a four night bus trip to Lille, Amiens and Arras on a Shearings coach.

However, after arriving at Royal Well Bus Station in Cheltenham in the rain for an 8.20am departure in plenty of time, they were left in the cold when the bus failed to turn up.

Moira Pearce, 80, and her husband Derek, 86, missed their coach trip to the French Christmas 

They were then told that their bus had arrived at the station - at 6am, and the times printed on their tickets were done in error.

After contacting Shearings to explain of their predicament, they were told they would have to claim the money back on their insurance, plus any associated excess costs. 

Speaking to the Gloucestershire Echo, 80-year-old Mrs Pearce said: 'We had been ringing them to try and get our money back, but nothing has transpired yesterday. They have told us we should just claim on the insurance.

'The way they have handled it made me angry.

'We even asked if we could get a taxi and catch up the coach, but were told that if we wanted to do that we would have to pay for it ourselves.' 

The tickets printed said the coach would depart at 8.20am, but it left Royal Well Bus Station at 6am

The couple, who live in the village of Alstone were planning on buying Christmas presents for their grandchildren on their trip.

A Thomas Cook spokesperson told MailOnline Travel:  'We are sorry to hear Mr & Mrs Pearce missed their coach trip to the French Christmas markets on December 7 as booked at the Co-operative Travel store in Tewkesbury.

'In this instance, Thomas Cook acted as a vendor on behalf of Shearings, with whom the booking was made. We have liaised with our colleagues at the coach operator with regards to this incident, and it is our understanding that Shearings are now in discussion with Mr & Mrs Pearce with a view to addressing their concerns in full.'

A spokesperson for Shearings Holidays has since told MailOnline Travel: 'We're very sorry for the upset caused to Mrs Pearce. The timing issues were a result of a misprinted ticket, which we apologise for unreservedly. 

'We have provided Mrs Pearce with a full refund and have offered a complimentary five day break as a gesture of goodwill.'
