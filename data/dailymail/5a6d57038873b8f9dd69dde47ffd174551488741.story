Pope Francis has said he wants 'a poor Church, for the poor' following his election as head of the Catholic Church.

In
 a meeting with journalists, the Pontiff said he was inspired to choose 
the name Francis after the 12th Century saint Francis of Assisi.

He
 said when news broke that he had been selected, a Brazilian colleague 
embraced him in congratulations and whispered 'don't forget the poor'.

He chose the Italian saint because he represented 'poverty and peace'.

Pope Francis revealed to journalists his hopes for the church, and how he came to select his name

'Let me tell you a story,' Francis said in a break from his prepared text during a special gathering for thousands of journalists, media workers and guests in the Vatican's auditorium.

Francis then described how he was comforted by his friend, Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes, as it appeared the voting was going his way and it seemed 'a bit dangerous' that he would reach the two-thirds necessary to be elected.

When the threshold was reached, applause erupted in the frescoed Sistine Chapel.

'He (Hummes) hugged me. He kissed me. He
 said don't forget about the poor,' Francis said.

'And that's how in
 my heart came the name Francis of Assisi,' who devoted his life to the 
poor, missionary outreach and caring for God's creation.

The pope thanked the media and told them how he had come to choose his name, saying he wanted Francis of Assisi who represented 'poverty and peace'

He said some have wondered whether 
his name was a reference to other Francis figures, including St. Frances
 de Sales or even the co-founder of the pope's Jesuit order, Francis 
Xavier.

But he said he was inspired immediately after the election when he thought about wars.

St
 Francis of Assisi, the pope said, was 'the man of the poor. The man of 
peace.

'The man who loved and cared for creation - and in this moment we 
don't have such a great relationship with creation. The man who gives us
 this spirit of peace, the poor man.

'Oh how I would like a poor church and a church for the poor,' Francis said, sighing.

He
 then joked that some other cardinals suggested other names: Hadrian VI,
 after a great church reformer - a reference to the need for the pope to
 clean up the Vatican's messy bureaucracy.

Pope Francis will now begin a busy week where he will meet the Argentinian president and his predecessor

Someone else suggested Clement XV, to counter Clement XIV, who suppressed the Jesuit order in 1773.

He urged journalists to share the church's focus on 'truth, goodness and beauty', and thanked them for their hard work.

The pope shook hands, held them, embraced people and was warm.

A
 blind reporter who was accompanied by a guide dog met the pope, and he 
patted the dog and stroked it, to cheers from the audience, Sky news 
reported.

The gathering in the Vatican begins a busy week for the pontiff that includes his installation Mass on Tuesday.

Among the talks, the Vatican said Saturday, will be a session with the president of Francis' homeland Argentina on Monday.

The pope has sharply criticized 
Christina Fernandez over her support for liberal measures such as gay 
marriage and free contraceptives.

Pope
 Francis will visit his predecessor at the papal retreat at Castel 
Gandolfo next Saturday in a historic encounter that brings together the 
new pope and the first pope to resign in six centuries.

The new Archbishop of Canterbury will miss the inauguration of Pope Francis due to him being on a 'pilgrimage of prayer'.

Archbishop Justin Welby is to be represented at next Tuesday's event by the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, in Rome, as he will be on a 'Journey in Prayer' around the Province of Canterbury

While religious leaders gather in Rome for the Pope's inauguration mass, the Most Rev Welby will be in Chichester for the concluding part of his journey.

Archbishop Sentamu will lead an Anglican group of fraternal delegates representing the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Anglican Communion who will attend both the inauguration mass on Tuesday and an audience with the new Pope on the following day.

The
 meeting will be private, but every comment and gesture on the sidelines
 will be scrutinised for hints of how the unprecedented relationship 
will take shape between the emeritus pontiff and his successor.

Benedict has been out of the public eye since officially leaving the papacy on February 28.

The
 Vatican dismissed any suggestion that the former pope helped shaped the
 discussions inside the secret gathering of cardinals that selected 
Buenos Aires Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio on Wednesday as the first 
pontiff from Latin America.

Vatican officials said there was no contact between the papal electors and Benedict before the conclave.

World leaders and senior international envoys, including Vice President Joe Biden, are expected on Tuesday for the formal installation of Pope Francis.

It offers the new pope his first opportunities to flex his diplomatic skills as head of Vatican city-state.

But the most potentially sensitive talks could come with Fernandez after years of open tensions over the then-archbishop's strong opposition to initiatives that led Argentina to become Latin American country to legalize gay marriage.

He also opposed - but failed to stop - Fernandez from promoting free contraception and artificial insemination.
