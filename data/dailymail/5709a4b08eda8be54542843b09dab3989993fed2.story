These stunning photos capture the spectacular scenes in Scotland last night - where the Northern Lights illuminated the sky with colour.

The deep purple and green bands of shimmering light were caught by award-winning photographer Maciej Winiarczyk - who spends much of his time snapping the aurora borealis.

The pictures were taken in Caithness, north Scotland - where people were treated to an extraordinary rare glimpse of the phenomenon.

Mr Winiarczyk said: 'Every aurora display is unique and you never know how it will develop over time.

'It's always intriguing and awe-inspiring and it's a very photogenic subject. I really like the dynamism of the whole spectacle.

'I could watch them every night and never get bored.'

The display is usually only seen from more northerly locations such as Scandinavia, Canada and parts of Russia.

But recent solar flares have meant electrically-charged particles - which are the cause of the light displays - have appeared further south than usual.

Last night, a solar flare hurled vast clouds of these particles towards Earth – producing displays such as this one, not only in Scotland, but also in some parts of north England. 

Known as coronal mass ejections, the clouds can produce an array of colours including green, pink, red, blue and yellow.

Mr Winiarczyk added: 'I was expecting the aurora display because a big explosion on the sun was reported with clouds of ejected plasma coming towards earth.

'There was a forecast for a big geomagnetic storm of G3 level, with potential for a sparkling aurora visible as far south as the south of England.

'We are still close to the peak of activity of the sun, which is main cause of the auroras, so we can still expect some good displays in the months ahead.'

Mr Winiarczyk, who is also a structural engineer, said he was lucky to get such good results as it seemed the elements were against him.

He said: 'On the photographs, the aurora looks quite clear but to the naked eye the display was not so obvious, as there was very bright moonlight in the sky washing out faint aurora details.

'The air was very foggy and there were plenty of clouds around so I spent more time driving around looking for clear locations than actually taking pictures.

'The best nights for observing auroras is when the Moon is out of the sky and it is really dark.'

Displays were also visible from England last night - which is extremely unusual so far from the North Pole
