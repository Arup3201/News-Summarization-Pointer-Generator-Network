Gazing into the camera, this curious kitten is one of 30 new residents who have taken over an animal charity worker's living room.

Carol O'Brien, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, is struggling to find new homes for the animals after they were abandoned or given away by their owners.

They are among about 60 cats which the Sunderland charity Ms O'Brien works for, Animal Krackers, is trying to rehome - the largest number in the organisation's 10-year history.

The charity has even warned it may have to start turning cats away unless new owners come forward.

Needing a home: This kitten is one of 30 that have been taken in by Carol O'Brien in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear

Ms O'Brien is fostering 30 kittens at her home, while a further 30 mature cats are being cared by for by other charity workers.

Ms O'Brien said: 'There are cats all over the place. Normally I have about half a dozen at a time, but now I sometimes get three or four pregnant cats a week.

'For the past two years, and especially since Christmas, numbers have been growing.

'I have had 17 pregnant cats since Christmas, then you will get four or five in a litter. The baby kittens used to be quite easy to re-home, but not now.

'I have been doing this for 11-years now, and my house has never been so crowded with them.'

Some of the kittens are still with me after five months, which is very unusual.'

Overrun: Ms O'Brien said the number of cats in her care had risen so quickly that her friends had offered to foster some until new homes can be found

Ms
O'Brien said the number of cats in her care had risen so quickly that 
her friends had offered to foster some until new homes can be found.

The sharp increase in numbers is being blamed on the recession.

Staff say people who see animal breeding as a quick way of making money can later find they are unable to look after them.

Ms o'Brien said: 'I think part of the problem is that it is so easy now to advertise animals for sale on Facebook.

'You get people eager to make some quick money by breeding cats.

'They think they are being clever business people, making £40 or £50 a cat, but often they can’t sell them quickly enough as people want the kittens when they are very young, and then they find they can’t cope.

'They don’t have to pay to advertise in a newspaper. Facebook is really convenient for them.

'Then the cats are getting dumped, or brought here.'

Warning: Sue Hardy, the animal charity's co-founder, has admitted it may have to start turning cats away

Warning that pets 'always suffer' during a recession, Ms O'Brien called for more financial help to be made available to owners who need to have their cats neutered.

She added: 'At the moment my house is completely crowded with cats, scratching my doors and making a mess.

'But I have some really lovely kittens and I just hope there are some people out there who are willing to give them a home.'

Sue Hardy, co-founder of Animal Krackers, who has nine rescue cats at her home, said: 'We’ve just had our 10-year anniversary and this is the most amount of cats we’ve ever had to re-home.

'We get cats for a variety of reasons, sometimes people tell us they need to get rid of their cat because they’ve just had a baby or fallen pregnant, we’re getting an increasing number of people who say that the council will not let them have more than two pets.

'The council and housing associations seem to be cracking down on the amount of pets people can have in their properties in recent years.

'Sometimes people come to us with genuine reasons - for example. elderly people who are unable to care for their pet due to ill health.

'We get a lot of pedigree cats and people don’t seem to be getting them neutered.

'We’re getting to the point that there are so many, we might have to turn some away and we don’t want to do that.'
