Six beach huts were  crushed in a landslide as heavy rain and strong winds lashed parts of the British coast.

The wooden structures were smashed off a cliff edge by a huge concrete slab and fell onto a promenade on Bournemouth beach in Dorset.

They slid down the side of the cliffs at Southbourne causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.

Destroyed: Six beach huts were crushed after heavy rain triggered a landslide in Bournemouth, Dorset

It is thought the heavy rain had made part of the cliffs unstable which triggered the landslide.

No one was hurt in the fall but the area has been cordoned off in fear of further slips.

John Bridle, from Christchurch, Dorset, stumbled upon the scene while out walking.

He said: 'As I looked from the clifftop I saw a six-foot by two-foot by six-inch thick piece of concrete had slid down the cliff.

Landslide: They tumbled down the picturesque Southbourne cliffs onto the beach below

Safety: The area has been cordoned off because of fears of further land slips

'It had broken off the stone back wall and pushed the beach huts across the promenade.

'There was not a soul about and it must have happened very slowly.

'There was this big slab of reinforced concrete and it had just slid down slowly and shoved all this sand and clay over the back wall.

'It shoved the huts, a bit like a bulldozer would, into the promenade.'

Huge costs: It is believed the fall caused hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage
