When lawyer Alice Biggar made her new year's resolutions, it wasn't to give up alcohol or go to the gym more. 

Instead the 26-year-old took on a challenge that would see her living off recycled butcher's bones, foraging for wild berries and eating food destined for the supermarket bin in her hometown of Southampton.

Miss Biggar decided to live below the poverty line for a month, and has challenged herself to live on £1 a day throughout January.

Alice Biggar, a lawyer from Bristol, has launched a challenge to feed herself on just £1 a day and said raiding reduced aisles in supermarkets and surviving on own brand tinned food and foraging for berries is the key

The task has seen her raiding the reduced aisles of supermarkets and even managing to get free recycled bones from a butcher's shop. 

She said: 'I wanted to challenge myself for the new year, so I made my resolution to be less wasteful with money and live below the poverty line on £1 a day.'

While she admits some of her meals have not been the finest in cuisine, Miss Biggar said she has managed to survive 28 days so far by living on tins, including tins of curry, and lots of cheap packaged items such as pasta and supermarket own-brand soups. 

She even triumphed in her search among the aisles to find an oyster, reduced to just eight pence. 

Pictured on day one of the challenge Miss Biggar said she was struggling with some of the budget products 

But she said the biggest task has been finding fresh vegetables at low prices.  

She said: 'My best buy was probably a huge bag of parsnips for 4p which I incorporated into a Burns Night supper. I've also visited Skipchen in Bristol - a restaurant which serves only food intercepted from supermarket bins, and I've been foraging for wild berries.'

Miss Biggar has charted her progress on her own blog, and said it has become suddenly popular as people appeared to like reading about her struggles to enjoy some of her budget meals. 

Day 1- Breakfast: cornflakes + office milk 

Lunch: warburton thins + pate 

Dinner: lasagne (40p) + cucumber (7p) 

Treat: few slabs of value choc (35p for bar) + live oyster (8p) 

Day 2 - Breakfast: porridge + water

Lunch: frozen toast from week 1 with 'Brussels pate' + 3 remaining fish fingers

Dinner: fresh egg noodles (10p) + value sweet and sour (30p) + broccoli (10p)

Treat: reduced doughnuts x 2 

Day 3 - Breakfast: cornflakes (30p) + value yoghurt

Lunch: burns night – haggis (£1) potatoes (15p) parsnips (4p) swede, leeks carrots (15p)

Dinner: leftover sweet n sour noodles

Miss Biggar said own brand soups have helped her feed herself within the tight budget she set

Treat: reduced doughnuts x 1

Day 4 - Breakfast: porridge + office milk

Lunch: skeleton soup + no bread

Dinner: parsnip (4p reduced) made into roasted chips and chilli (tinned)

Treat: apple, chocolate buttons

Day 5 - Breakfast: 30g of coco snaps + milk

Lunch: Vegetable soup and out of date pitta

Dinner: Spag bol (tinned)

Treat: Value onion rings

Day 6 - Breakfast: 30g of coco snaps + office milk

Lunch: Tin of questionable chicken soup + 1 pitta

Dinner: spaghetti hoops on toast

Day 7 - Breakfast: 30g of coco snaps + office milk

Lunch: Tin of tomato soup + 1 pitta

Dinner: 250g penne pasta + half carton passata + two onions + four hotdogs + black pepper borrowed from housemate’s cupboard 

The blog documents the highs and lows of her progress - including on day 10 when her dog Dexter stole some treasured reduced doughnuts, saved as rare treats to help her cope during the month long challenge.

In a post on day 10 she wrote:' It's lunchtime and the curry noodles make an appearance, another student classic.

'At 25p a pack they're a reliable filler and perfectly edible, if a little beige. Utilising vegetarian chicken flavouring it's a tick in the ethics box but a fail on the quest for protein and fresh food.' 

Miss Biggar said doing her shopping on a weekly basis helped, setting herself a maximum budget of £7 which forced her to shop creatively and not waste any items.  

1. Buy supermarket own brands for your staples, for example large bags of pasta.

2. Cook meals in bulk - such as casserole and save portions. 

3. Get to supermarkets for prime reducing times, usually between 7pm and 9pm. 

4. Don;t be afraid to ask supermarket workers if something is due to come down in price later that day. 

5. Try something new - such as foraging or venues like Skipchen, a venue in Brighton that serves food past it sell by date that has been rescued from a sure path to supermarket and restaurant dustbins.

6. Don't stick religiously to best before dates, use your own judgement to test some items rather than automatically throwing them out. 

7. Stock up on tinned goods, such as own brand soup.  

Three weeks into the challenge Miss Biggar said she felt she was getting to grips with how to keep her meals low cost and had learnt some tricks, such as foraging for her own berries and making her breakfast at work so she could take advantage of work milk. 

She wrote: 'Week 4 and I'm starting to get this budget strategy nailed, a combination of bulk cooking and raiding the whoopsie aisles for fresh food bargains seems like the way to go.

'I recognise that getting to the aisles at the optimum time in order to get my snout in the trough can be a bit of a barrier to fresh produce within the budget. It certainly isn't necessarily always practical for those with families or those who work at those times.

The lawyer has also posted recipes for her some of her creative menus - including for 'skeleton soup' which she makes from a base of recycled chicken bones, donated from her local butcher. 

Miss Biggar is completing the challenge to raise money for the Trussell Trust, which aims to tackle poverty in the UK and Bulgaria.

Miss Biggar has lost seven pounds by completing the challenge but insists she has not gone hungry. 

She says while it has been a good experience, she is looking forward to being able to treat herself again. 

'I would recommend everyone tries the challenge for a week - it makes you realise how much we waste on food and it really does make you appreciate what you have,' she added. 

'On a personal note though, I'm looking forward to having a wine, take-away and film night.'
