A 12-year-old boy has been praised for his bravery after suffering horrendous burns saving his grandmother's life.

Seth Cutright has been left with heavy burns across his face, body and arms after a propane heater exploded in their home in Vernonia, Oregon, on Friday.

Seth said he could smell leaking gas just before his grandmother, Rose Cutright, lit a cigarette in her bedroom at about 3pm.

The resulting explosion set the house - and Rose - on fire, and Seth rushed into action, picking her up and carrying her out of the burning building.

Before the injuries: Seth, left, and his grandmother Rose were home alone when the accident occurred

Their home was almost completely destroyed by the fire, and the Red Cross is currently sheltering the family as they rebuild their lives.

But all of them are just grateful to be alive.

Seth told Komo News that he could smell the gas just before the house exploded into flames.

He said: 'It was like "Boom!" - a flash before your eyes.

'My grandma was on fire - not completely on fire, just a 
little bit.

'Then when I was walking, it went out.'

He added: 'I carried her outside 
and set her on the ground. I went to the next-door neighbor’s and said: "Call the ambulance".'

Deadly flames: The fire took three hours to put out, after a faulty propane heater leaked gas

Scars: Seth's hands are still bandaged following the accident, and his parents wish to raise awareness about household fires

Our hero: Seth has been praised by his parents for his quick-thinking during the dangerous inferno

The two family members are now 
recovering from their injuries at Oregon Burn Centre - the grandmother 
Rose remains in serious condition.

However Seth is expected to make a 
full recovery with no scarring - but he wanted to show his face to warn 
people about the dangers of gas leaks.

Asked if he had seen his face in the mirror yet, Seth joked: 'Yes - whoa I'm ugly!'

He also wanted to say a big thankyou to the Oregon Burn Centre for their prompt treatment.

Seth's parents were interviewed for 
Komo News, and Steth's father, Roger, told him on camera: 'I love you. 
I’m proud of you. You’re my hero.'

Firefighters
had to spend three hours fighting the flames before getting the fire 
under control, and were able to save several cats and chickens from the 
flames.

... Now watch the interview with Seth...
