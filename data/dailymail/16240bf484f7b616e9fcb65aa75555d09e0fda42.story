A San Diego family in mourning in suing Petco after they say their 10-year-old boy died from rat-bite fever he contracted from a pet purchased from the retailer.

Aidan Pankey died just hours after coming down with flu-like symptoms two weeks after buying a mate for his pet rat at the Carmel Mountain Petco.

San Diego County medical examiners would later rule his death was caused by streptobacillus moniliformis, or rat-bite fever, and now his family wants unspecificed damages from the national chain for failing to prevent his tragic death.

Rat-bit fever: 10-year-old Aidan Pankey died last June from bacteria his family says was transmitted from a pet rat

Attorney John Gomez told The Associated Press on Tuesday that his firm filed the lawsuit Monday in San Diego County for the suffering endured by the Pankey family after Aidan died June 12.

‘He was a bright, energetic, friendly, happy kid who actually had a prior rat, who was a female, and he had this idea in his young head of having his female rat get married,’ Gomez said.

Aidan's grandmother Sharon Pankey took the boy to the Carmel Mountain Petco location to buy him a second rat after seeing how happy the first one made him.

'He'd pop her on his shoulder and that little rat would hang on,' Sharon Pankey told ABC News. 'It was like she was saying all right! Let's go dad.'

Streptobacillus moniliformis

Rat bite fever is a bacterial infection caused by either Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minus, both are found in the mouths of rodents.

Symptoms include chills, fever, joint pain, redness, swelling, rash and swollen glands.

With treatment, which consists of a 7-14 round of antibiotics, prognosis is good.

Untreated, the death rate is as high as 25 percent.

Rat-bite fever may also be known as Streptobacillary fever, Streptobacillosis, Haverhill fever, Epidemic arthritic erythema, Spirillary fever, or Sodoku.

She said Aidan wanted to breed his female rat oreo.

'He said, "you know Grammy when Oreo has babies I'm going to be grandpa and you're going to be a great-grandma,"' Sharon said.

But that opportunity would never come.

Over the course of one summer day, Aidan went from energetic young boy to death.

'I put him to bed after a day at the doctor’s office and the next thing I knew it just was too late,' Sharon said.  'I went into his room and he couldn’t speak. He was unstable on his feet. I got him down to my room and he collapsed on the floor. I called 911 because it was scaring me that his breathing was shallow and he seemed to be losing his ability to function.'

'We didn’t know what he died from at first,' she said. 'When I took him to doctor he said he had the flu, but you don’t die from flu in less than 48 hours.'

It wasn't until Christmas that the family learned the true cause of Aidan's death.

But they'd already begun to fall apart.

Dead in a day: 'I put him to bed after a day at the doctor¿s office and the next thing I knew it just was too late,' Aidan's grandmother Sharon Pankey said.  'I went into his room and he couldn¿t speak. He was unstable on his feet.'

'He was my family,' said Aidan's distraught father Andrew Pankey. 'I'm probably down 30 to 35 pounds since then. I don't even get hungry. I just go until I pass out.'

Who's at fault? The family is suing Petco for unspecified damages in a suit that claims that were negligent in preventing Aidan's death

'He was my family,' Aidan's father Andrew Pankey told ABC 15. 'I'm probably down 30 to 35 pounds since then. I don't even get hungry. I just go until I pass out.'

According to ABC15, the Carmel Mountain Petco sources its rodents from Barney's Pet Supply, a large wholesaler in Chino, California.

The retailer in a statement expressed its condolences.

‘We are deeply saddened by the Pankey family's tragic loss,’ Petco said in a statement. ‘The health and safety of people and pets is always a top priority, and we take the family's concerns very seriously.’

Petco insisted in a statement that it uses the most rigorous safety standards in the industry.

But the family is concerned that's not enough.

'It's a means to ensure this doesn't happen again,' Gomez said of the lawsuit. 'Apparently there was some breakdown in procedures. They want tighter controls.'

¿We are deeply saddened by the Pankey family's tragic loss,¿ Petco said in a statement. ¿The health and safety of people and pets is always a top priority, and we take the family's concerns very seriously.¿
