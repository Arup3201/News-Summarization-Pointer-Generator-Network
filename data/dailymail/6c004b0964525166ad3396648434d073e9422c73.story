A Sydney primary school teacher has been awarded $689,294 in damages after she was 'violently pulled' to the ground by an eight-year-old Sudanese refugee pupil - legally only identifiable as Student X - at a school in the city's northwest.

Jeannette Sticker, a primary school teacher since 1979, successful sued the NSW Department of Education & Communities after judge Leonard Levy found her employer failed to 'act in a timely manner to protect the staff and students at the school from the violent, aggressive and anti-social behaviour of X'.

Ms Sticker, 55, suffered a lumbar disc protrusion on March 18, 2009, when attempting to discipline Student X for 'behaving aggressively, including using a stick to assault other students' at Bert Oldfield Public School in Seven Hills, which boasts the motto 'Safe, Respectful, Responsible Learners.'

Suffering: Jeannette Sticker has been dealing with 'serious' injuries since the ugly school incident and now has difficult even sitting

The District Court of NSW heard that Ms Sticker broke up the fight and began leading Student X, in Year 2 at the time, to the principal's office, but 'unexpectedly for the plaintiff, X propped and braced himself in a doorway in the corridor with his free hand and with his feet, and he then violently pulled the plaintiff backwards with some force'.

The fall caused 'serious twisting injury to her lower back and to her right hip', forcing Ms Sticker to undergo surgery and suffer significant loss of earnings, the court found.

She has suffered 'constant pain' and has 'difficulty sitting, standing or walking for sustained periods' since the injury.

She became unemployed February 22, 2011, due her diminished ability to work, the court found.

Student X, a Sudanese boy who has spent time in refugee camps, 'was seen to represent an extreme danger to others' by the school prior to Ms Sticker's injuries.

He was found to display 'uncontrolled behaviour', 'had hit and kicked other children in the past', was a source of 'danger to himself, other pupils and to teachers', and other children were 'were frightened of him' at the time of the incident.

Judge Levy found that systemic failings were to blame for the school not acting with enough urgency in addressing the risk posed by Student X, and 'The response of the school lacked immediacy for such a serious problem where students and staff remained at risk of serious injury in circumstances where the slightest trigger could precipitate the behaviours in question.'

Negligent: Judge Leonard Levy ruled that the NSW Department of Education (which runs Bert Oldfield Public School) was negligent in failing to protect Ms Sticker from Student X

The Department claimed Ms Sticker was somewhat to blame for her own injuries for 'Failing to take any or any proper precautions for her own safety in all the circumstances; being inattentive; and conducting her work in a manner contrary to her induction and training.'

Those arguments were dismissed by judge Levy.

Ms Sticker now works as the national training manager for a private college in Australia and earns significantly less income due to her disabilities, the court agreed.

In a decision handed down earlier this month, as a result of the school not taking reasonable steps to prevent the 'deliberate violent act', Ms Sticker was awarded $480,250 for future loss of income and superannuation, $179,807 for past loss of income and superannuation, and a further $29,237 in compensation for the tax she has paid on workers' compensation since the injury.

The decision came three months after the NSW Industrial Relations Commission dismissed an appeal against the NSW Department of Education by Stephen Krix, 51, who was sacked for misconduct after putting a student who punched him in the face in a headlock at Riverstone Highschool, also in Sydney's northwest.Â 

Neither Ms Sticker nor her lawyer immediately returned MailOnline's calls.
