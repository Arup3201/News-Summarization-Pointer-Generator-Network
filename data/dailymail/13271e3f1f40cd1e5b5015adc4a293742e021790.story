They are the kind of outfits neither Maria Sharapova nor Serena Williams would be seen dead in.

But the 1922 Wimbledon Women's Singles final between Suzanne Lenglen and Molla Mallory was altogether more modest affair by the looks of it.

The French player Lenglen even turned up wearing a fur coat. It must have brought her some good luck - she went on to win 6-2, 6-0.

The image is part of a collection of rare and unseen photographs from the early days of the world's most famous tennis tournament.

In action: French player Suzanne Lenglen went on to win the Women's Singles final in 1922. Outfits in the ladies' game have got somewhat racier since then

Entertaining: Suzanne Lenglen shows the players were just as athletic and competitive

Fair play: Australian tennis players Gerald Patterson and James Anderson hold up their mascots before their men's singles semi-final. Patterson went on to win the title

They are included in a new book 
by coach Bruce Tarran about the life of George Hillyard, the man who 
moved the tournament to its present location in SW19.

Although Wimbledon had already been 
going for more than 40 years by 1922, it was a significant year as it 
was the first time it had been played on Church Road.

Huge crowds can be seen queuing patiently to get in, many dressed up in their best attire for the day out.

One image shows fans milling about between courts, most sporting the fashionable hats and dresses of the time.

Australian tennis players Gerald Patterson and James Anderson are pictured smiling broadly before their semi-final math. Patterson went on to win the Men's Singles title,Â  defeating his compatriot Randolph Lycett 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.

And another photo captures the familiar sight of groundsmen rushing on to Centre Court to pull on the covers as rain stops play once again.

Fans are also pictured waiting patiently under umbrellas for it to stop.

Popular: The tournament drew huge numbers of fans who can be seen in their finest attire for a day out in SW19

Landmark: 1922 was the first year Wimbledon was held at its present Church Road location

Bruce Tarran's book describes how in 
1887 Hillyard, aged 23, married Wimbledon Ladies champion Blanche 
Bingley and influenced the world of tennis for the next 40 years.

He
won Olympic doubles gold at the London Games in 1908 and helped found 
the Lawn Tennis Association, wresting power over the game from The All 
England Club.

Fast forward to 2013 and the outfits 
may have got a little racier, and the tennis a lot faster, but the 
inclement British weather still has the ability to play havoc with the 
tournament schedule.

Thankfully the forecast for this 
year's tournament, which starts on Monday, looks positive with dry and 
sunny weather expected for much of the week.

Britain's Andy Murray will be hoping to go one better after losing in last year's final to Roger Federer.

And the World Number Two will be 
upbeat after winning Queen's last week and a draw which means he will 
avoid Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals.
