Virgin Australia is  lowering fares as a result of plunging international oil prices cutting its fuel costs, sparking hopes other carriers will follow suit.

Virgin has cut seat prices on flights from Australia to Los Angeles by $40AUS (£20) for economy fares and $50AUS (£25) for business class.

The decision comes after Virgin Atlantic cut a £10 fule surcharge in December, yet other airlines have not yet offered savings to customers.  

Fare drop: Virgin Australia is cutting seat prices as a result of the plunging price of crude oil however few of the other major carriers are promising similar cuts

Virgin Australia said today it was lowering fares  in anticipation that fuel costs would continue to remain at lower levels than the record highs seen in recent years.

A spokesman said: 'Over the past 10 years, despite oil prices reaching some historic highs, domestic airfares in Australia have gone down more than 20 per cent, driven by strong competition in the market.'

However, despite calls by politicians in the UK, other airlines are yet to follow suit.

They argue that buying fuel months and sometimes years in advance means they are yet to experience the saving caused by recent drops in oil price. 

Australian airline Qantas said: 'The bottom line for consumers is that Qantas fares already in the market are some of the cheapest in years.'

Oil prices have fallen by roughly 50 per cent in the past four months with barrels of  crude trading for just $48 in London today.

British Chancellor George Osborne has called on  to pass on the benefits of falling oil prices to their customers

A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: 'As an airline, we buy our fuel months and years in advance which means that historically when we have had to increase our fuel surcharge this has not been at the same rate as oil costs have increased. 

'Similarly, decreases in the price of crude oil do not lead to an immediate significant reduction in our on-going fuel costs.

'We’ll continue to monitor the situation and keep fuel surcharges under review to make them as affordable as possible.'

Similarly budget airline easyJet say that as they too 'hedge' the majority of their fuel they are yet to benefit from the fall in the price of crude.

A spokesman said: 'As at 18 November 2014, we had bought 80 per cent of our fuel until the end of September 2015 (at $944 per metric tonne) and 58 per cent for the period 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016 (at $921 per metric tonne) so oil price fluctuations will only have an effect on less than 20 per cent of our fuel this financial year and less than half our fuel in our 2016 financial year.'  

In the UK politicians are calling on companies to pass on the benefits of falling oil prices on to their customers 

Earlier this month Chancellor George Osborne tweeted: 'Oil price was $53 pbl last night – lowest in 5yrs. Vital this is passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares.'

And Lib Dem Treasury Minister Danny Alexander has written to package holiday firms demanding they cut prices after oil fell to a six-year low. 

He said: 'Consumers have suffered the pain of high oil prices, it’s only right that companies and organisations do all they can to pass on as quickly as possible every last penny of oil price falls.'
