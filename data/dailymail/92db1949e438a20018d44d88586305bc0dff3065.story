A 10-year-old girl from Michigan is suing her mother's ex boyfriend for $54,000, who refused to give her dog back after they moved out of his home when they caught him allegedly cheating.

Hannah Wise, of Famington Hills, says that Mitchell Rechter, 54, wouldn't return her teacup poodle named Mystery after she and her mother left his home last spring.

The couple broke up after 
Lenhoff and Hannah arrived at Rechter's home to find him 'having relations
with someone Adrienne later learned was a convicted felon.', the Detroit News reported.

Hannah is the plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Oakland County with the consent of her mother, Adrienne Lenhoff, according to The Oakland Press of Pontiac.

Lenhoff says she also fronted money to renovate Rechter's condo and take trips together, which is incorporated into the $54,000 lawsuit.

She also wants compensation for moving and storage costs, the cost of her Jewish marriage contract from her first marriage, that Rechter ripped up, and other items he has refused to return.

According to the lawsuit, Rechter agreed to take care of the dog only while they got settled in a new home.

Hannah said Mystery was a gift from her grandmother three years ago.

'He was a part of me,' the girl said. 'He would come in my bed and snuggle up to me.'

Rechter 'wouldn't give me my dog back,' she said. 'And he knew that I cared about that dog so much. It was really heartbreaking for me.'

On Friday, Hannah spoke about her 
experience to about 500 people during a storytelling event at the 
Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. The 
crowd cheered for the girl.

Rechter's
lawyer, Jonathan Jones, responded to the girl's complaint, according to
the Oakland County Clerk's Office, saying, 'The plaintiff abandoned the
dog, gave it to the defendant to take care of, knowing he wanted to 
care for the dog, and took another dog with her when she left.'

Also, Jones said in a letter to Hannah's lawyer, Robert Zawideh, that based on the time that has passed Rechter is 'attached to the dog and wants to keep it.'

Lenhoff said Rechter became a father figure to her daughter during their relationship. She said the incident has given her daughter her first heartbreak.

'This has made her not trust adults,' Lenhoff said. 'A big part of her innocence has been taken from her because of this.

'These are lessons that no child 10 years old should have to be learning.'

The suit also claims Rechter won't return other items belonging to Lenhoff, such as jewelry, accessories, golf shoes, Ugg boots and a Cuisinart toaster.

Lenhoff and Rechter had discussed marriage and buying a home together during their relationship, leading Hannah's mother to sell their condo and move in with him.

The trial is scheduled for July 2014.
