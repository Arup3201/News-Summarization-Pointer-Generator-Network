The mother of a five-year-old Saudi girl who was tortured to death by her ‘celebrity cleric’ father, has said she wants him brought to justice.

Lama al-Ghamdi died in October having suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, broken ribs and left arm as well as extensive bruising.

It has been alleged that she had also been repeatedly raped and that the injuries she sustained from the sexual abuse had been burned.

It was previously reported that her father Fayhan al-Ghamdi, a prominent Islamist 
preacher who regularly appears on television in Saudi Arabia, had been 
released after paying ‘blood money’ to his ex-wife, and Lama’s mother, 
Syeda Mohammed Ali.

It has now emerged that Lama’s mother is bringing her own case against al-Ghamdi, who is still in prison.

‘My dear child is dead, and all I want
 now is justice so I can close my eyes and know she didn't die in vain,’
 Syeda Mohammed Ali, told CNN, adding that her daughter was ‘brutally 
tortured in the most shocking ways.’

She is divorced from al-Ghamdi who is 
remarried and has two more children, and claims the torture happened 
whilst Lama was in her father’s care in March last year.

‘The state needs to even consider taking his two children from him and his wife away because I fear for their lives,’ she added.

Torture: Saudi preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitting beating his daughter with a cable and is said to have been concerned about his five-year-old daughter's virginity

'These are not 
some unfounded accusations, but everything is based on the medical 
examination by the hospital and the team of physicians who treated Lama 
when she was first admitted.'

She said al-Ghamdi had voiced concerns about five-year-old Lama's virginity.

According to the Saudi Arabian Human 
Rights Commission, al-Ghamdi has been imprisoned for the past eight 
months and that the case is still under review.

Syeda Mohammed Ali said her ex-husband has admitted to the torture and will face justice when the next hearing in the case takes place in two weeks.

Activists from the group Women to Drive said the preacher had doubted Lama's virginity and had her checked up by a medic.

Randa
 al-Kaleeb, a social worker from the hospital where Lama was admitted, 
said the girl's back was broken and that she had been repeatedly raped and her injuries burned.

It was reported that al-Ghamdi agreed to pay £31,000 ($50,000) in blood money, a fact denied by Lama's mother who says al-Ghamdi did not rape Lama.

Activists say under Islamic laws a father cannot be executed for murdering his children. Husbands can also not be executed for murdering their wives, the group say.

Three Saudi activists, including Manal al-Sharif, who started the women's right to drive campaign, have raised objections to the case as it highlights the urgent need for legislation to protect women and children from domestic abuse.

Manal al-Sharif has launched a campaign on Twitter using the hashtag 'Ana Lama', which is translated as I am Lama, calling for an improvement on the judicial treatment of women and children.

Local reports say public anger in Saudi Arabia is also growing and authorities have said they will create a 24-hour hotline to take calls about child abuse.
