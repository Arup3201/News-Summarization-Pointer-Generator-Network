Their flattened bodies glide through the water with ease and grace but that doesn't mean they can't work up a hell of an appetite.

Stingrays normally feed off small fish, snails and shrimp around coral reefs, but in the Northern Territory the species has been captured using its powerful shell-crushing plates to devour a whole salmon.

The docile creature slowly emerged out of the murky water, in remote Anson Bay, on to the sand where a blue salmon - caught by fishermen - lay.

The stingray, known locally as Raymond, repeatedly raises its body above the salmon and gradually pulls and tugs until the whole fish is consumed, in the incredible video.

Helicopter based fishing tours and adventure company Helifish caught the footage and posted it on their Facebook page.

'Our guide Ben had a salmon that got caught and didn't survive the release,' the company explained.

'So when our resident friend Raymond showed up he gave him a little treat....amazing creatures.'
