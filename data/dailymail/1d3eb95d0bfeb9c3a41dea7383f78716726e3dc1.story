The Orange Order has weighed into the Scottish independence debate - denouncing nationalism as 'a divisive and evil enemy' during a march in support of the Union.

The Protestant fraternal group, known for its political interventions in Northern Ireland, held a parade through the centre of Edinburgh yesterday.

However, the controversial march was disowned by the official anti-independence group, Better Together, following fears that it could stoke sectarian violence.

Alistair Darling, leader of the No campaign, said: 'They are nothing to do with us.'

Despite worries about the possibility of unrest at yesterday's 'Proud to be British' march, it passed off largely peacefully as thousands of members showed their devotion to the UK ahead of Thursday's referendum.

Marchers gathered to hear speeches by senior figures from around the UK, before setting off past some of Edinburgh's most famous landmarks including the Scottish Parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.

In a speech ahead of the march, grand chaplain Henry Williamson said: 'Brothers and sisters, in a world of instability, a world of insecurity, a world of nuclear proliferation, of radical Islam, people look to the UK as a land of hope, a land of peace, of success and unity and an example if what they so desperately long for - unity not stupidity, unity not division, unity not separation, unity not them and us.

Excitement: Well-wishers talking amongst themselves as the match went past

He added: 'Let me remind you that when an enemy came against the city of Londonderry, God's people famously said there will be no surrender to this evil enemy.

'It was a cry we made in 1914, it was a cry we made in 1939, it is a cry British people make every time we face an enemy who seek to destroy who and what we are, and a cry that we make on behalf of the underdog.

'Well, a divisive and evil enemy has arisen against Scotland in the guise of false patriotism and the nationalist referendum, against our beloved United Kingdom, and our reply as God's people this time is "no separation".'

Support: The streets were lined with sympathisers who expressed their support for the No side

Music: The march was accompanied by a military band as it made its way through the Scottish capital

Drummers: Members of the Orange Order played on drums marked with Unionist symbols

Ron Bather, grand master of the Grand Orange Lodge of England, said: 'As individual nations, could we have succeeded in defeating Nazism in 1939? I don't think so.

'It was the resolve and the endeavour of the individuals that make up this country that stood up against a mightier foe, and how many times in the past has this country been left to stand alone and yet has never been defeated.

'To you Scottish sisters and brethren, this coming week is your chance to defeat once and for all the separatists, the people that want to change your way of life.'

Appeal: Supporters handed out stickers suggesting that the Queen was against independence

Poster: One marcher denounced 'separatism' from Scotland

National: Marchers came from all over the UK to show their support

Scale: The march snaked through the streets of Edinburgh past prominent landmarks

He added: 'Over that last few days, certain people in the No camp have been questioning the validity of taking to the streets of Edinburgh today.

'Let me say to them people, as members of the Orange Institution we don't sit behind closed doors and plan things, we don't walk the streets with balaclavas on, we walk the streets openly to profess our religion and our heritage.'

Edward Stevenson, grand master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, said: 'Next year, as is a long held tradition, many of us will come over to Scotland for the annual Battle of the Boyne commemorations, and we very much hope that we will not require our passports.'
