Murder, She Wrote actress Angela Lansbury has been appointed as a dame in the Queen's New Years Honours list.

She led a cast of female stars in the honours list yesterday, as women outnumbered men for the first time.

The 88-year-old is most famous for her role as Jessica Fletcher in the popular crime show which made her a household name.

She is to be made a Dame for services to drama and to charitable work and philanthropy.

She told the BBC: 'I'm joining a marvellous group of women I greatly admire like Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.

'It's a lovely thing to be given that nod of approval by your own country and I really cherish it.'

Dame is the female equivalent of the honour of knighthood in the British honours system.

Murder, She Wrote earned the actress international acclaim and 12 Emmy nominations for her role as a Cabot Cove widow and amateur detective with an uncanny knack for solving grisly crimes

It has been a good year for the three-time Oscar
 nominee - she received an honorary Academy Award during the 5th Annual 
Governors Awards in November

The honour of knighthood comes from the days of medieval chivalry.

The
 honours list consists of knights and dames, appointments to the Order 
of the British Empire and gallantry awards to servicemen and women, and 
civilians.

The nominations,
 submitted either by government departments or by members of the public 
are passed to a committee and then when drawn up given to the Queen 
through the Prime Minister.

The Queen informally approves the list and letters are sent to each nominee to inform them of the proposal.

Once
 a nominee accepts the proposed honour, the list is formally approved 
and published in the official Crown newspaper, the London Gazette, twice
 a year - at New Year, and in mid-June on the date of the Queen's 
official birthday.

Last month Lansbury defended the title of the 
original award-winning CBS drama Murder, She Wrote.

In October, NBC announced that Octavia Spencer will be starring in a 
contemporary version of the popular series, which ran for 12 seasons 
from 1984 to 1996, and plans to name it Murder, She Wrote.

'I think it's a 
mistake to call it Murder, She Wrote.'

'Because Murder, She Wrote will always be about a Cabot Cove and this wonderful
 little group of people who told those lovely stories and enjoyed a 
piece of that place, and also enjoyed Jessica Fletcher, who is a rare 
and very individual kind of person.

'So I'm sorry that they have to use the title Murder, She Wrote, even though they have access to it and it's their right.'

Lansbury is returning to the London stage in March — after an absence of four decades.

The
 legendary actress will play dotty medium Madame Arcati in Noel Coward’s
 Blithe Spirit, reprising a role that won her a Tony award on Broadway 
four years ago.

‘You 
could say it’s my last chance,’ she said, before adding swiftly:
 ‘It isn’t! But you could say that. After all, I am 88 — in my 89th year
 now. But I’ve got many more years left. I do believe that.’

Lansbury, who was born in London and went to South Hampstead School for Girls, comes from a long line of British actors and politicians.

Decades ago she went to Hollywood to make Gaslight — and stayed.

Her most significant successes — films such as The Harvey Girls and The Manchurian Candidate; the five Tony awards on Broadway; and the long-running Murder, She Wrote TV series — were all achieved in America.

Another British female who has also achieved fame in America, Katherine Jenkins, 33,  was honoured for services to music and charity.

But there were no honours for Wimbledon winner Andy Murray and footballer 
David Beckham, who announced his retirement earlier this year.

Following
 last year’s honours, which recognised Britain’s Olympic heroes, this 
year’s list was dominated by a record number of female recipients.

Overall,
 51 per cent of this year’s honours were given to women, compared with 
34 per cent in the 2004 list, 28 per cent in 1994 and just 17 per cent 
back in 1974.
