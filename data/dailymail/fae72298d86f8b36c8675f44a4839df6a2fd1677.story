A ‘mild-mannered’ homeowner may have snapped and killed a ‘neighbour from hell’ before suffering a fatal heart attack.

Alan Taylor, 59, was pronounced dead at his home on Sunday by paramedics after he suffered a cardiac arrest.

Police were called and found the body of Richard Wight, 55, which had ‘physical injuries’, in his house next door.

Essex Police were last night understood to be looking into the possibility that Mr Taylor attacked his neighbour before collapsing and dying.

Discovery: Police have sealed off the scene in Braintree, Essex, after two bodies were found in neighbouring homes

He is thought to have endured years of harassment from Mr Wight.

The lorry driver had a long history of terrorising neighbours in his street in Braintree, Essex.

In 2008 he was jailed for eight weeks after going to Mr Taylor’s home twice on the same day and harassing him.

He also spent seven months in custody 
in 2002 while awaiting a court hearing for threatening another man in 
the street with an axe.

Officers found cannabis at his house when they arrested him.

Ambulance workers confirmed they were 
called yesterday to a report of a man suffering from a cardiac arrest 
but when they arrived he was already dead.

It was only then that paramedics were alerted to another body in the neighbouring property, believed to be Mr Wight.

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service, said: 'We were called at 4.48pm to an address in Eagle Lane, following reports a man was in cardiac arrest.

'One rapid response car and two managers were sent to the scene. The man was declared deceased at the scene and whilst there, we were made aware of another person who was also declared deceased at the scene.'

'Suspicious deaths': Neighbours said Alan Taylor, whose home is the light green property with a red Rover 25 parked in the driveway, would row with Richard White, who owned the adjoining brown cottage, over parking in the narrow lane

Today neighbours said Mr Wight would 
‘worry’ about leaving his van in the lane and often shouted at takeaway 
drivers who blocked up the road.

One neighbour, who didn’t want to be 
named, said: ‘Something had been going on between the pair of them - we 
said it looked like that had been rowing, it was as though they were at 
war over something.

‘There was definitely tension there when I saw them.’

One former resident of the lane said: 
‘Richard did not have any family and I believe there was only one person
who used to come and visit him.

‘He was something of a loner and when 
we lived there he would come out and shout at delivery drivers when they
dropped takeaways off.

‘Somebody bumped into his van once 
down the lane and he put a big note in his window, stating the date and 
time that the accident happened which me and my partner thought was 
quite odd at the time.

Evidence: The van thought to belong to Richard Wight being removed from the scene today

Driven away: A forensics officer removes the red Rover from the driveway of one of the deceased men for it to be examined

Emergency: Paramedics were called to the scene, but the man they attended to was already dead

Narrow: Police stand guard at Maple Lane's only entrance in Braintree, Essex

‘He was always worrying about his van which was parked in the lane.’

An Essex Police spokesman said: ‘The deaths are being treated as suspicious and both scenes are being forensically examined.

‘The enquiry is focusing on the movements of the men or activity in Eagle Lane since January 1  2012.

‘Detectives from the Kent and Essex 
Serious Crime Directorate are investigating these deaths thoroughly and 
will be in a position to give more information when they have 
established exactly what has happened at these two addresses.’

An East 
of England Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: ‘We were called at 4.50pm
and sent two rapid response vehicles and two managers to the scene.

‘When we arrived we discovered one patient deceased although at that stage it was not known that there was another person.

‘Another body was found in a neighbouring property as we were leaving.’

Ambulance personnel stayed at the scene for more than two hours assisting police with their investigations.
