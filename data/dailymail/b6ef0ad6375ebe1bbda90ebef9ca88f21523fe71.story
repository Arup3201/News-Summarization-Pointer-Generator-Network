A New Hampshire man accused of abducting a teenage girl, holding her captive and repeatedly raping her over the course of nine months pleaded not guilty after waving his right to an arraignment.

Nathaniel Kibby, 34, was charged last month with 205 criminal counts in connection to the kidnapping of a 14-year-old girl at gunpoint in October 2013.

Kibby was arrested in July, a week after the girl was reunited with her family.

If looks could kill: Nathaniel Kibby (pictured in July) pleaded not guilty after waving his right to an arraignment in the October 2013 abduction and sexual abuse of a 14-year-old girl 

Kibby has been indicted on charges he kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, imprisoned her, and sexually assaulted her over nine months at his New Hampshire home

Court documents made public in mid-December allege that Kibby repeatedly raped the girl, who is now 16, and used death threats, a stun gun, zip ties and a shock collar to control her.

The Gorham resident had been scheduled to be arraigned in Coos County Thursday and in Carroll County Friday, but last week his public defender waived the arraignments and entered not guilty pleas on his client's behalf, reported the Boston Globe Monday. 

Kibby is accused of abducting the teenager on her way home on October 9, 2013, in the White Mountains town of Conway. 

Despite a massive search and widespread public outreach, there was no trace of her except for a letter she wrote to her mother in November of that year.

The teen returned just as mysteriously in July, a week before Kibby was arrested.

Media outlets repeatedly published the girl's name and picture after she disappeared and when she returned home. 

The girl's family and prosecutors have asked that her name and image no longer be published because they fear the publicity and association with sexual abuse will slow her recovery from what they call a horrific trauma.

Kibby, 34, was indicted in Carroll and Coos counties on charges including kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, criminal threatening, illegal use of a gun and illegal use of an electronic restraint device. 

In the records released last month, more than 160 of the indictments were heavily blacked-out.

Kibby has been held on $1million bail since his arrest at his home in Gorham, about 30 miles from the girl's home. 

He has a criminal history dating to 1998, including convictions on simple assault, criminal trespass and breach of bail conditions, according to court records.

Police said the girl was last seen after leaving Kennett High School in Conway. She walked her normal route down a busy road toward home and sent several texts to a friend between 2.30pm and 3pm.

But when her mother returned from work, the girl was not home. Prosecutors said she had no way to travel or get food, shelter or other necessities on her own. 

They said she 'went dark' and could not be traced through social media for the duration of her absence.

Police did reveal in December 2013 that she had written home to her mother. When the letter surfaced, FBI Special Agent In Charge Kieran Ramsey said there was the possibility the girl had run away, but someone could still be coercing her into staying away from home. The contents of the letter have never been released.

Lawyers hired by the victim's family said in August she suffered 'numerous acts of unspeakable violence' during her months of captivity.

Court documents revealed that the teen told investigators she learned her captor's name from a cookbook he had handed her.

A police officer who has known Kibby for two decades said he's very bright, opinionated and thrives on conflict.

In an interview in July, former Conway Lt. Chris Perley said Kibby, 'was smart, but he was also brutally myopic in whatever view he had. You could not shake him or redirect him in the way he saw the world.'

Kibby grew up and attended school in Conway.  He worked as a machinist at two gun makers — Green Mountain Rifle Barrel Co. and E.M.M. Precision.
