Mario Balotelli failed to impress during his second-half cameo – but the Italian wasn’t too impressed with Sunderland either.

As he left the Stadium of Light, the out-of-form frontman sniped: ‘This is the f*****g coldest city I’ve ever f*****g played in.’ 

Cold and slippy, it seems. For Balotelli, having outwitted John O’Shea with his one moment of quality, duly lost his footing and landed on his backside as he made his way through on goal. 

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli said Sunderland was the coldest city he had ever played in

According to holiday-weather.com, Milan, where Balotelli played for AC and Inter, has an average January temperature lower than Sunderland. And so does Turin... where Juventus play. Try again, Mario

Sunderland  5°C

Milan            1°C

Turin             3°C 

Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, formerly of Sunderland, admits he did not warn his team-mate about the North-East climate.

‘I didn’t warn Balotelli about how cold it was because otherwise he would have been worried before the game,’ he said.

‘It certainly was cold and windy out there. Afterwards, though, he could smile about the three points like the rest of us.’

Balotelli certainly wasn’t smiling following his expletive-laden assessment of Wearside.

But lucky for him, Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri could take Balotelli off Liverpool's hands in January after confirming his interest in the struggling striker.

Allegri worked with the Italy forward at AC Milan and has admitted he would like to bring his former player back to Serie A on loan with talk of a permanent option for £14million during the summer.

'We would like to recruit him, but we do not know if it's possible,' The Times quote Allegri. 'Mario had a good season with me.

'Unfortunately he's built up a character outside the world of football and everyone talks about what he does off the pitch. All coaches love to lead the best players.

'But Balotelli is a Liverpool player and I think first he has to think about playing well, sacrificing and giving his best - especially to show everyone who says he is an important player.'
