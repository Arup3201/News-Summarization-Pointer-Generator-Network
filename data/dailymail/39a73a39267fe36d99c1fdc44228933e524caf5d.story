The 25-year-old Australia's Next Top Model contestant who is reported to have accompanied police to identify the body of Charlotte Dawson at the TV star's Sydney apartment is 'struggling' to cope a day later.

NSW Police told the MailOnline they are preparing a report for the state Coroner on the body of the 47-year-old who was found in a unit on Cowper Wharf Road, Woolloomooloo yesterday.

Police said forensic officers will conduct a post mortem to establish the cause of the death of the woman who is yet to be 'formally' identified.

Mentor: Charlotte Dawson (left) mentored 20-year-old model Simone Holtznagel (right) who along with Maddy Huett regarded the TV star as her 'Sydney mum' and remained friends after the 2012 Australia's Next Top Model show was over

Maddy Huett regarded Dawson as her 'Sydney mother", along with another model contestant, Simone Holtznagel, Dawson having mentored the two young girls both of whom do not come from Sydney.

Huett is from Tasmania and Holtznagel is from the Illawarra region several hours south of Sydney.

Eerily, Huett posted a message about depression on her Twitter account three days before Dawson's death, when friends say the TV star was in 'very bad shape emotionally, terrible shape'.

Huett posted '1 in 3 of us go through depression, anxiety or panic attacks at least once in our life . . . let those who struggle know they are not alone'.

Work worries: Dawson (centre) pictured with contestants from Australia's Next Top Model allegedly had money worries and was not continuing as host of the modelling show, although there are mixed reports as to whether she quite the show because of its 'toxic' message about body image, or was not renewed

Huett's mother said her daughter had been 'very close to' Dawson.

'She called her, her Sydney mother. She's strugglling. She'll be alright [but] they just became very good friends after the show.

'[Dawson's death] is very affecting. It's very affecting for a lot of people.

'I just think [Dawson] had depression and it's a serious issue.

'[Maddy] is trying to cope, coping with the awful news. It's just a sad period in her life.'

Since yesterday, friends of Huett's have posted messages of support on her Twitter account.

'Love to you at this sad time,' wrote Kezza72.

'Thinking of you gorgeous girl xxxxx,' wrote brooklynokeefe. Cottrellclaire wrote, 'love to you beautiful. Thinking of you.'

A message from brideilarby to Huett, who has now left Tasmania and made Sydney her permanent home, read, 'Thinking of you honey... Know there's always a bed and home cooked meal across the sea if you need me (or a vanilla malt pop) big love xxx'.

Maddy Huett (left) and Simone Holtznagel (right), pictured in Sydney with US rocker Steven Tyler, were both contestants in Australia's Next Top Model, after which they became friends with Dawson, nursing her after her 2012 hospitilisation over depression and regarding her as their 'adopted mum'

Huett's mother said her daughter had abandoned her modelling. 'She's no longer pursuing her mdoelling career. She's changing channels,' she said.

Last year Ok! Magazine interviewed Dawson about her mothering of Huett and Holtznagel, in a story with the headline, 'Meet My Adopted Daughters'.

Dawson had earlier told an interviewer she had become pregnant while married to Scott Miller, but she terminated the pregnancy because the swim star was preparing for the 2000 Olympics.

Dawson told Ok! that Simone had literally saved her life.

'Simone . . . found a white-tail spider in my bed!' she said.

Simone was staying the night at her Dawson's apartment – something the two girls did often – when she discovered the spider between the sheets.

'I was making Charlotte’s bed and I flipped the doona back and there it was,' Simone told Ok!. 'Charlotte was like, 'Is it even dangerous?' and I was like, 'Yeah, it can kill you!'.'

The girls spoke of how they nursed Charlotte back to health after her 14-year battle with depression, which landed her in St Vincents hospital, in August 2012.

You are not alone: Posted on Huett's Twitter page before her 'adopted mum' Dawson's death, this message from Mental Health Week is an eerie reminder of the struggle Dawson was having, which landed her in hospital, after which Huett and another young model nursed her back to health

'They help me; they're really good – like when I went to hospital, they came and looked after me; they picked me up from the hospital.'

Maddy Huett told Ok! Charlotte was the kind of person 'who you just automatically warm to – she’s nurturing and the one that you connect with the most on the show – but she’s our mum!'

But when it came to Dawson's latest battle with depression, it appears no-one could save her this one final time.
