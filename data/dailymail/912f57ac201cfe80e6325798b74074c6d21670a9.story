Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Arsenal have won all 12 of their Champions League qualifying games so far.

The Gunners have netted 29 goals in those 12 games, an average of 2.4 goals per game while they have shipped only three in total, keeping nine clean sheets.

Besitkas have lost just one of their 16 Champions League qualifying games, winning 10 and drawing five.

The Turkish side have won just four of their 14 clashes with English sides in Europe (incl. qualifiers), losing seven and drawing three.

Aaron Ramsey bagged three goals in the Gunners’ two CL qualifiers against Fenerbahce last season while he is currently on a streak of scoring in each of his last four games for Arsenal in all competitions.

Besiktas’ summer-signing Demba Ba bagged two goals in five games against Arsenal (in all comps), with those goals coming courtesy of a brace for Newcastle in the Magpies’ 7-3 loss against the Gunners in December 2012.

Arsenal have averaged 2.5 goals in their last eight games in all competitions (20 goals).
