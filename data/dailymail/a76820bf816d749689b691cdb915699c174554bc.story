A former New York City police officer cleared of conspiring to kidnap, kill, cook and eat women was sentenced to time served  Wednesday for illegally accessing a federal database.

Gilberto Valle, 30, also received one year of probation, was ordered to continue to get mental health treatment and banned from contacting women involved in the case.

Prosecutors are appealing Judge Paul Gardephe's decision to override a jury verdict and order Valle acquitted of conspiracy.

Scot free: Gilberto Valle, 30, the former New York City police officer cleared of conspiring to kidnap, kill, cook and eat women, has been sentenced to time served Wednesday for illegally accessing a federal database

Conditional release: Valle (center) received one year of probation, was ordered to continue to get mental health treatment and banned from contacting women involved in the case

Media circus: Valle's sensationalist case has been closely covered by news outlets, and his court appearance Wednesday was no exception  

Aspirations: Valle's attorneys said that he does not want the 'cannibal cop' stigma to become his legacy, and that at age 30 he still hopes to make something of his life  

The ex-NYPD patrolman, pictured here on Wednesday with his defense team, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife found disturbing pictures on his computer

Valle was dubbed the 'cannibal cop' by news outlets after his 2012 arrest.

Jurors heard evidence that he communicated online with people he had never met about killing and cooking his wife and others.

In one of the numerous online conversations shown to the jury during the trial, Valle told a man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey. ... She'll be terrified, screaming and crying.'

In another exchange, Valle suggested a woman he knew would be easy prey because she lived alone.

The men discussed cooking her, basted in olive oil, over an open fire and using her severed head as a centerpiece for a sit-down meal. 

The jury convicted him of conspiracy in July, but the judge wrote that evidence made it 'more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play.'

He was facing life in prison.   

'He didn't mean it': A judge concluded that Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping and cannibalism were nothing more than 'fantasy role-play' 

Disgraced: Valle was fired from the NYPD as a result of his legal troubles 

Defense lawyers said previously that their client had suffered enough.

'He has lost nearly everything,' they said. 'He lost his job. He lost his liberty for 21 months. He lost his wife and his child. He lost many of his friends. He lost his reputation and anonymity.'

The lawyers have said Valle now recognizes that the substance of his Internet chats was 'deeply troubling and disturbing' and meets weekly with a counselor to discuss it.

'Although having his sexual fantasies revealed in the public forum of this prosecution has been devastatingly embarrassing for Gil, there also is a sense of relief and liberation in being able to confront and overcome them,' the lawyers wrote.

They added: 'Gil does not want his life's legacy to be the story of the "Cannibal Cop." He is only 30 years old and intends to make something more out of his life. Inspired by the team of people who defended his innocence, Gil wants to go to law school.'

Valle, then a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife, Kathleen Mangan, found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com.

The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat.

Sick fantasies: Valle told a man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey'

Future plans: His lawyers said that the 30-year-old has been inspired by his defense team to pursue a career in law 

They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body.

Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out.

Mangan, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce in July. She has taken the couple's young daughter and completely cut off all contact with Valle and his family.
