George Groves struggled to get out of second gear but eventually found his stride to stop Denis Douglin and stay on track for another tilt at a world title.

The Londoner, who lost twice to Carl Froch in the last 12 months, barely gave himself pass marks for what was a below-par performance.

Groves is the mandatory challenger for Anthony Dirrell's WBC belt, a fight for which negotiations are expected to start next week. 

Douglin, who is rather uniquely trained by his mum Saphyia, had won his previous three fights and also has one scheduled for next month.

But he hit the canvas hard in as fight approached the halfway point when Groves landed successive right hooks to the head.

Douglin managed to beat the count but was stopped moments later when the referee stepped in following another barrage of shots on the ropes.

Groves needed several rounds to work out his opponent who was more than happy to march forward but whose shots were on the crude side.

Douglin enjoyed a strong second round as he outlanded Groves who left himself far more open than was necessary.

But, gradually, Groves stamped his authority on the fight, finding his range and slipping some rather wild shots.

And he landed the decisive blows in the seventh session to set himself up for bigger challenges to come.

Groves said: 'Paddy [Fitzpatrick, his trainer] gave me five out of 10 and I'll need to watch it back but I'd probably agree.

'It was what I needed, he's a good fighter. It's good to get another stoppage and be back knocking people out.

'There are other options but I want the quickest route [to a world title] and that is the WBC.'
