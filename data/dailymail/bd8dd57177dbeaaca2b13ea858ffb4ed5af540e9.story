After years of planning and a $100 
million fundraising campaign, George Washington's Mount Vernon estate will
formally open a new library today.

It will be home to visiting scholars who will live at Mount Vernon and research specific aspects of the Founding era, including the study of America's 
first president and the Founding Fathers.

A rare-book vault houses dozens of books that Washington personally owned.

The
library will function in some ways like a modern presidential library.

But the Mount Vernon library receives no government funding and is 
intended primarily to foster formal scholarship; it is not designed to 
accommodate casual tourists.

The estate in 2006 opened new education and
orientation centers to serve the public.

A dedication ceremony is scheduled at the 45,000 square-foot library today.
