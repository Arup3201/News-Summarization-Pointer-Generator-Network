With her stomach bulging and face straining, just lifting a weight seemed a struggle less than a month ago. 

But it seems Victoria Wood’s tough workout has certainly done the job as the much-loved comic looked sleek on the BAFTAs red carpet last night. 

The 60-year-old looked trim as she joined a host of TV celebs, including Emilia Fox and Patsy Palmer, just three weeks after she was spotted in London’s Hampstead Heath with a personal trainer.

The BAFTA ceremony, which celebrates the best behind-the-scenes talent in British television of the past year, gave its Special Award to Strictly Come Dancing. While historical gangster epic Peaky Blinders received two Baftas.

Broadchurch and Educating Yorkshire, two of the year’s most popular programmes, also came away as winners. Broadchurch won a Bafta for original music while Educating Yorkshire was rewarded for its editing.

The divorced mother-of-two, who lives in a £3million house close to Hampstead Heath, has spoken of her lifelong struggle with her weight - beginning with a childhood eating disorder.

Miss Wood, who has suffered from depression, once said: ‘I used to make my own food and ate on my own in my room.

‘I’d
 eat from the minute I got out of school until I went to bed... I was an
 obsessive eater. I used food as a drug, a distraction. I was on 
slimming pills at 12.’

She added: ‘Food caused me the most anxiety. I used to eat non-stop. I ate if I felt lonely, tense or tired. Every question was met with the same answer: food. Sugar was my drug of choice.

‘It took me years to realise I had an intolerance to it and that there was a connection between sugar and my depression.’ 

She discussed her various failed diets and eating plans in 2004’s Victoria Wood’s Big Fat Documentary.
