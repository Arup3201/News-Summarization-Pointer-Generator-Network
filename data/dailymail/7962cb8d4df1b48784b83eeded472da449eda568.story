Children can bring overwhelming joy to their parents' lives. But they can also make overwhelming messes and cause a lot of trouble.

Now, one Instagram account is documenting all the childhood hijinks that make life a little more hectic for moms and dads.

Kids Are The Worst posts photos of all the messy, exasperating, but ultimately adorable, things children get up to, from drawing on walls to dunking their hands into jars of Nutella.

Seeing the funny side: Creator Anna Macfarlane posts  photos of kids being mischievous, and captioned this imagewith 'How do you know when to hide all the markers? #TheWritingIsOnTheWall #Literally'

Pillow fight: Mrs Macfarlane commented alongside this image that the young girl featured cut open her parents' cushions before giving herself a new hairstyle with the same scissors

Follower-submitted photos include children throwing things in toilets, pouring food all over the floor, and crying over birthday cake.

Created by Salt Lake City mom Anna Macfarlane, the Instragam account has amassed over 60,600 followers since it launched in May of 2014.

'I started @kidsaretheworst on Instagram as a way to share the madness of child rearing with my friends and anyone else who has kids that aren't perfect 24/7 (sic),' Mrs Macfarlane says. 

Making a mess: The Instagram account documents messes made by peanut butter, lotion, paint, markers, eggs, cereal, and mascara

Topsy turvy: 'Sometimes you run into a friend at Target and while you catch up, your kids throw down,' the caption for this image stated

Kitchen aid: Clearly this young boy wasn't a fan of the way his parents had stored the dishes 

This month, the Utah-based mother and writer launched a blog under the same name, which she updates with links, videos, and stories about parenting.

She also doesn't hesitate to tell funny stories about her own children. 

'When my oldest son was two years old, he would rate the noise level of others in the public bathrooms,' Macfarlane wrote in one post, before revealing the sorts of comments her son would make: '"Mom, did you hear that? Sounded light lightening." One time he said, "Did you hear that woman? That one is gonna stink!"'

Kids, however, aren't the only thing that are 'the worst' - the creator has also launched two more Instagram accounts full of hilarious user-generated snaps.

On Dogs Are The Worst, followers find naughty pups who have destroyed pillows and used pricey shoes as chew toys.

On Weddings are the Worst, photos are posted of cheesy wedding photography, poor wardrobe choices, and not one but two tiered pizza cakes topped with mini bride-and-groom figurines.
