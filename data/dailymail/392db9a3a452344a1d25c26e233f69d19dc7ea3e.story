When it comes to designing apps, the hope is usually that your program will not only be useful to people but that you might also be able make some money as a result of its creation.

For Gentry Underwood, his wildest dreams were realised when his Mailbox app was sold to Dropbox for $100 million. The app wasn't even available to the public, only by joining a mailing list.

The Mailbox app allows users to organise and clear their email inbox in a far more smartphone friendly way than previously available.

Multi-Million-dollar idea: Developer Gentry Underwood has sold his Mailbox app, which allows touch screen technology users to access their emails in an easier format, to Dropbox for $100 million

As CEO and co-founder, Mr Underwood has been speaking about how he managed to make an app that was centered around a simple idea of making email easier to manage on mobile devices.

He came up with the idea after realising that traditional email programs were failing to be updated to work to their full potential on new technology platforms such as mobile phones.

His app works with the way people use their mobile phones rather than their laptops, making accessing their emails via their phones easier.

He told Wired how he spotted a gap in the market: 'It’s very natural when a new platform comes along to expect behavior to work as it did in the old platform, which means, for a smartphone, take a desktop email client and jam it down into the mobile device, because that’s all you know.

You don’t know how people’s behavior is going to be different; you’ve never seen it before.

Well, turns out we use our mobile phones really differently than we use our laptops. It’s taken us a while to figure that out and understand it, and that creates a design opportunity for a different kind of tool.

Fundamentally, Mailbox is not an email client so much as it in an inbox, oriented around delightful processing. 

$100m buyout: Mailbox was purchased by Dropbox, the company that allows users to share big files easily between themselves and others. Underwood calls it a 'logical' partnership

Another reason that tool hadn’t appeared is third-party mail apps are really hard to build well. They require a massive technical investment. Mail itself is this very old protocol that generally is very slow.

To deliver mail quickly when you open your device, we actually took a lot of infrastructure that historically has lived directly on the mail client and we moved it into the cloud.

When you set up a mailbox account, Mailbox begins checking your mail from the cloud, reformatting it, sending you push messages when there are new messages, and having this tiny little snapshot ready for you when you open up the phone that, as soon as you hit the network, we just hand it to you as quickly as possible.

That allows us to create a fast experience even though we’re only accessing the radio for a brief amount of time. But it’s a massive technological challenge to pull that off.

For every person using mailbox there needs to be a bit of dedicated infrastructure that’s acting like a mail client on behalf of the cloud. The gap was created by mobile devices themselves.'

Mailbox is popular because it provided innovative new ways to organize and clear an inbox.

Users of Mailbox can view their inbox and the latest email they've opened at the same time compared to other programs that only allow users to view one or the other at a time.

They can also use four simple gestures to control their email rather than having to select options and go through sub-categories before they find what they need.

To archive an item, all they have to do is quickly swipe the message to the left, and to 'snooze' the message to look at later, the user just performs a slow left swipe.

A slow swipe to the right will delete the email while a fast right swipe will file it.

It is currently only available to Gmail users but Mailbox plans to soon be available across other email providers.

He tells the online magazine about how creating the Mailbox app was so resource intensive that the buyout from Dropbox came at the right time.'we were about to outgrow our space in Palo Alto and were in the process of looking for a new one — and getting a lot of the basics of keeping a business up and running taken care of. We felt like we had stumbled into this really large market, this very big opportunity.

We felt like we could raise money but we still would have the problem of scaling a good team, and obviously it’s not just engineering and design; there’s also customer service and all the details of actually building an office and growing a team and building a culture.'

The marriage between Dropbox and Mailbox seemed like a logical step, Mr Underwood says.

Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring your photos, documents and videos anywhere and share them easily.

The Dropbox allows users to create a special folder on each of their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of which computer is used to view it.

The founder of Dropbox, Drew Houston, came up with the idea after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive while he was a student at MIT.

He created Dropbox to make his life easier and in much the safe way Gentry Underwood beleives Mailbox will also simplify the way email is used.'If you think about mail as attachments, there’s a relationship between those things, and there’s no good mobile mail client that let you attach things easily from Dropbox,'Mr Underwood also talks about the difficulty app designers face: how to create money from selling an app whilst keeping advertising to a minimum.'You can imagine Mailbox going to some company that monetizes through advertising, where over time we’re going to have to find ways to put more and more ads into Mailbox — things that might actually decrease the overall experience or invade a user’s privacy.

Whereas here we just have to build a product that people really like and want to use so much that some of them are willing to pay for it. That’s a much easier design challenge. It’s something that we thought about quite a bit as we were trying to figure out where to take the company.'The Mailbox app has had people talking about the simplicity of the idea for many months now. One critic summed up the thoughts of many: '“How insane is it that this guy invented four email gestures — swipes, in iOS jargon — and sold his company for $100 million?;

Gentry Underwood understands the nature of the business and how, in so many ways, he has been extremely lucky.

'Without commenting on the specific numbers of the deal, I will say that this is a very unusual market and the potential impact of these devices, I think, is what’s driving it. Mobile is ripping the world wide open.

The companies that respond to that stand to be quite relevant in the future, so that’s what creates these seemingly crazy numbers.'
