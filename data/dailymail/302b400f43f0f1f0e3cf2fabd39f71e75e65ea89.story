People living in Britain’s 10 richest constituencies pay almost 10 per cent of the nation’s tax bill, new figures show.

All of the seats are in or around London and between them contribute £13.6billion-a-year, more than the whole of Scotland, Northern Ireland and most English regions.

The official data from HM Revenue and Customs comes as Chancellor George Osborne faces fresh criticism for failing to act to ease the burden on higher earners, with 5million people set to be dragged into the 40p rate.

People living in these 10 London constituencies contribute £13.6billion in tax each year, equivalent to almost 10 per cent of the total tax paid by the whole country

Latest figures from HMRC show that in 2011-12 total tax paid by individuals came to £165billion.

The Conservative constituency of Kensington contributed £2.45billion, the Cities of London and Westminster (Con) £2.16billion and Chelsea and Fulham (Con) £1.87billion.

Hampstead and Kilburn, where Labour’s Glenda Jackson is MP, contributed the fourth highest amount  £1.47billion, followed by Richmond Park (Con) £1.16, Westminster North (Lab) £1.15billion, Esher and Walton (Con) £939million, Wimbledon (Con) £930million, Battersea (Con) £874million and Islington South and Finsbury (Labour) £823million.

Together the constituencies account for 906,000 people paying more tax than 2.64million living in the North West.

By contrast Clacton in Essex paid just £92million in tax, the lowest in the country. Other low tax areas include Torbay, Wolverhampton South East, Blackpool North and Cleveleys, Blackburn and Blackpool South.

The figures reveal the over-reliance on London as an economic powerhouse, with a small number of mega-rich individuals bankrolling much of the public sector.

The figures show that the top 10 constituencies contribute more tax than Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and most English regions

Nick Faith, from Policy Exchange think tank, said: ‘London is now home to the largest number of millionaires in the entire world and their taxes continue to prop up the rest of the country.

‘It wasn’t always this way. But as northern towns and cities suffered the effects of deindustrialisation, London’s dominant service based economy grew, leading to a brain drain of talent to the Capital.

‘London is one of the world’s leading cities and we should look to maximise its potential.’

He said the government had to make other cities more attractive for the next generation of millionaires.

‘Investing in better transport links, building more homes through a more streamlined planning system and aligning public sector and private sector pay to boost job creation are all measures that will help attract British born and foreign business leaders to set up home in other regions of the UK.’

However the situation is likely to be exacerbated by plans to further increase the amount of money people can earn before paying tax.

Mr Osborne used his Budget on Wednesday to announce the income tax threshold will rise by another £500 to £10,500.

Tory Chancellor George Osborne has faced calls to ease the tax burden on middle earners but Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg has insisted tax cuts be focused on low and middle earners

The top 25 per cent of earners will contribute 75 per cent of the total £167billion income tax

Nick Clegg, who has championed the Lib Dem policy, claims this ‘workers’ bonus’ will be worth an extra £100-a-year.

But Tory MPs are angry at the refusal of the Treasury to offer more help to those people dragged into paying 40p tax rate.

Since the coalition was formed Mr Osborne has frozen or lowered the point at which workers start the higher rate of tax.

It means that of 2million more people sucked into the 40p rate since the last election, 1.4million more than would have been affected under Labour’s plans.

Those caught by George Osborne’s failure to lift the threshold in line with inflation will be £546 worse off next year, according to the respected  Institute for Fiscal Studies.

But the Chancellor’s changes to Labour’s plans for the 40p rate, once reserved for the wealthiest in society, mean the Treasury has raked in an extra £3.6billion.

If Labour’s plans had been adhered to by Mr Osborne, people would have begun to pay the 40p tax rate if they earned £47,845 in 2015-16.

This year 4.4million people will pay the 40p rate, up from just 3.02million when the coalition was formed in 2010 and only 1.35million in 1988.

If it had risen in line with wage growth, the 40p rate would only apply to someone earning more than £75,000. Instead it has fallen to £41,450.

Official figures show that in 2013-14, the 25 per cent highest earners will pay 75 per cent of all income tax, while the top ten per cent, on £47,913 or more, will account for 59 per cent. The top 1 per cent will pay 28.3 per cent, or £47billion.

The Treasury said that thanks to the £10,000 allowance, in 2013-14, higher rate taxpayers are about £45 better off than if tax thresholds had grown in line with inflation.
