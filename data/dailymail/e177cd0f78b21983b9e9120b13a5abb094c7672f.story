Six years of construction of the One World Trade Center has been condensed into a fascinating two-minute timelapse video.

Brooklyn based photographer Benjamin Rosamond took around 30,000 photographs of the 104-storey building from the day construction began in 2006 to the day when the final beam was laid in 2012.

He painstakingly compressed 1,100 photos to create the two-minute timelapse video which shows the 541 metre skyscraper emerging from the Manhattan skyline as the years pass.

The New York building, which dominates the skyline and is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, can be seen from miles around.

One of the most visible, politicised and high profile buildings in the world, the One World Trade Center, which was built after the September 11 terrorist attack , lies on Ground Zero.

For years the site lay abandoned as authorities and victims' families argued over the design.

Eventually, a compromise was forged  and the building was designed part memorial, part commercial centre and part transportation hub.

The construction of the One World Trade Center in New York was captured by photographer Benjamin Rosamond who took 30,000 images and compressed 1,100 of them into a two-minute time lapse video

Once plans were agreed and politics put aside, the construction of the building, which is known colloquially as The Freedom Tower, stepped up. In the final two years of construction, a new floor went up every week.

And with it, came a robust security measures designed to withstand a terrorist attack on a building which has already been targeted twice in the past.

The One World Trade Centre can be seen mid way through construction. Building took six years while the authorities and families of the victims decided what the purpose of the skyscraper should be

The first 20 storeys of the tower are a windowless concrete block strong enough to withstand the blast of a truck bomb, taking into account the 1993 bombing where Ramzi Yousef drove a truck filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the underground garage of the North Tower.

The blast opened a 30 metre hole in the building and six people were killed, while 50,000 workers took hours to evacuate the building.

Meanwhile the glass which smashed and fell to the ground like knives during the September 11 attack is now shatter-proof.

Stairs and elevator shafts have their own ventilations systems and one staircase has been reserved for the emergency services only.

All of this was captured in Mr Rosamund's two minute video, highlighting the astonishing amount of time and energy that has gone into building one of the world's most recognisable buildings.
