The future of the BBC Trust is to be reviewed after an ‘annus horribilis’ for the corporation, the Culture Secretary said last night.

In a scathing response to the payoff debacle, Maria Miller said the corporation’s handling of executive pay was ‘just not good enough’ and serious questions had been raised about the judgment of its top managers.

She said she planned to strengthen the legal powers of the National Audit Office to allow it to demand access to all BBC documents whenever it wanted.

In response to her comments, the BBC 
announced plans to ‘re-examine’ the relationship between its executive 
board and its governing body.

Warning: Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the scandal of BBC pay-offs raised serious questions about the judgement of the Corporation's bosses

On Monday, seven current and former 
BBC chiefs were called before MPs to explain why it handed £369million 
in severance deals to its staff, including £25million to 150 top 
managers.

She said she planned to strengthen the legal powers of the National Audit Office to allow it to demand access to all BBC documents whenever it wanted.

Miss Miller said the past year – in 
which the corporation also came under fire over the Jimmy Savile child 
abuse revelations and a failed £100million IT project – had been an 
‘annus horribilis’, the Latin phrase used by the Queen to describe the 
Royal Family’s traumatic year in 1992.

Speaking to the Royal Television 
Society’s annual conference in Cambridge, Miss Miller  said: ‘This has 
undoubtedly been one of the most challenging years in its history.

Monday was a grim day for its senior management. Ultimately, licence-fee
 payers rely not only upon the right structures and governance being in 
place but also upon the BBC’s executive management using their good 
judgment.

‘And I think serious questions were 
raised about that judgment by the scale of the severance payments made.

Licence-fee payers expect their money to be spent properly. This has 
been an annus horribilis for the BBC. But we all know that institutions 
can recover and come back stronger from years like that. The BBC will 
bounce back.’

Speaking to the Daily Mail before her 
speech, Miss Miller said the severance scandal arose from confusion 
between the BBC Executive and the Trust, which is led by Chris Patten. 
She said: ‘It’s simply not acceptable that confusion is there.

‘I will keep the governance 
arrangements under review. When you have the National Audit Office 
saying they have weak governance, it’s time to take that seriously.’

huge pay and perks

The full scale of the severance pay 
scandal emerged in July after the government spending watchdog conducted
 a six-month investigation into executive payoff deals.

But the audit office was blocked from 
looking at the details of several payoffs, including money handed to 
former director of vision Jana Bennett. It emerged last week Miss 
Bennett was secretly handed £700,000 by the BBC while the audit office 
was still conducting its investigation.

Miss Miller said such secrecy was 
‘unacceptable’, adding: ‘I believe we must look for the NAO to have a 
significant statutory role where nothing can stop them looking at what 
they want, when they want.’

In a letter to Miss Miller yesterday, 
BBC director general Tony Hall said he would launch a ‘comprehensive 
review’ into the relationship between the corporation and the Trust, but
 insisted the existing governance structure was fit for purpose.

He admitted: ‘The last few days have 
not seen the BBC at its best. The recent NAO report and Public Accounts 
Committee hearings have highlighted questions about whether the BBC’s 
current system of governance has worked as effectively as it clearly 
should.

‘The Trust and Executive Board have agreed that we should now re-examine the relationship between the two parts of the BBC.’
