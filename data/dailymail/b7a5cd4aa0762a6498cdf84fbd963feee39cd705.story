Elisabeth Hasselbeck has confirmed that she will be leaving The View after ten years on the program and got teary-eyed when she said goodbye during her last day on Wednesday.

Reports surfaced Tuesday that Hasselbeck, the lone conservative Republican on the talk show, is headed to Fox News' morning talk show and so The View quickly announced that today's show would be the blonde's last appearance as a co-host.

Hasselbeck kept her emotions in check as she thanked each of the three co-hosts (the fifth, Sherri Shephard, is off this week) and the women exchanged compliments about one another.

Quick goodbye: Elisabeth Hasselbeck confirmed that she will be leaving The View after ten years and will now be co-hosting one of the Fox News morning programs

Parting words: Joy Behar couldn't help but take a shot at Elisabeth's conservative views, sarcastically saying that she would surely be a 'fish out of water' at Fox

'Over the course of a decade I feel like I have attended the Barbara Walters school of broadcasting and journalism,' the 36-year-old said as she turned to her mentor.

'I feel like I have my masters from being next to you.'

Hasselbeck and Walters were the two who got the most emotional during the goodbye on Wednesday's show, as Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar stayed a bit more stoic.

Goldberg and Behar, the two most liberal voices on the daily panel show, both thanked Hasselbeck, with Goldberg calling her 'the cat's meow' and Behar taking a pot-shot at her new employer. 

'Gee, Fox- won't you be a fish out of water there?' Behar said to Hasselbeck.

Support: Barbara Walters was the most emotional during the opening segment where they talked about Hasselbeck's departure after ten years on the show

Behar and Hasselbeck regularly 'sparred' on the show over their political differences but Behar asserted that they were still good friends who went back to 'talking about shoes' as soon as the discussion was over.

Hasselbeck also gave a shout out to Shepherd even though she was missing from the set on Wednesday, saying that she is her 'sister in Christ and I will love you for life'.

Hasselbeck joined The View in 2003 after initially achieving some fame from competing in the 2001 series of Survivor.

Her time on the talk show has not been entirely smooth sailing: she famously got into an on-air argument with Rosie O'Donnell over the war in Iraq that lead to producers using a split-screen to show the two women verbally attacking one another.

Removed: Goldberg and Behar (left and center left) were the least effusive with their praise on Wednesday and did not seem visibly upset about the news of Hasselbeck's departure

Sparring partners: Behar and Hasselbeck were frequently at odds when it came to political discussions as they represent the opposite ends of the spectrum

Cool sign off: Whoopi said that Elisabeth was 'the cat's meow'

She also issued a tearful apology to former ESPN host Erin Andrews after she said that the peeping Tom who taped her naked in her hotel room wouldn't have had to do that if he waited for her revealing outfits during her turn on Dancing With The Stars. 

This morning, Hasselbeck thanked Walters for helping make her 'more than prepared and confident to move forward' with her new position at Fox.

The mother-of-three will be taking over for Gretchen Carlson, who is the female co-host on Fox and Friends.

Hasselbeck will join Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade as Carlson will be anchoring her own daytime show on Fox.

Faux tears: In an surprising move, rather than first thank her co-hosts, Hasselbeck praised the efficiency of the workers behind the scenes- from security to the make up teams- who made their jobs easier

Mock anger: Hasselbeck joked that Sherri Shepherd's absence- the fifth co-host is away for the week- would not count as an 'act of protest' to keep her from leaving

'I have been a long-time fan of Fox & Friends and am excited to be joining their team in September as it is an honor to call the Fox News Channel my new television home,' Hasselbeck said in the Fox News Channel announcement released on Tuesday.

Hasselbeck's departure is not the only one shaking up The View.

Walters, who created the show with her producing partner Bill Getty in 1997, is retiring next summer and Behar announced in March that this would be her last season on the show.

'We are not going to be filling it very soon,' Walters said of Hasselbeck's seat.

May 2007Rosie O'Donnell and Hasselbeck were co-hosts for several months, but an on-air spat between the two led to O'Donnell's departure. The war in Iraq was always a 'hot topic' on the show, and the infamous split screen fight after O'Donnell accused Hasselbeck of refusing to stand up against pundits who twisted her words.

July 2008

Elisabeth broke down in tears when the group started talking about whether or not it was ever appropriate to use the n-word. Goldberg and Shepherd- the two African American hosts on the show- said that it was allowed in conversations among black people but not by white people, and Hasselbeck argued that such divisions implied that the two races lived in two different worlds. December 2008She sparred with lesbian singer Melissa Etheridge over Proposition 8, saying that gay marriage should not be settled by 'activist judges' but rather come from the people. May 2010 Former ESPN anchor Erin Andrews went on Dancing With The Stars a year after a peeping Tom was arrested for filming her naked in a hotel room and stalking her. When The View hosts were talking about the reality dance competition, Hasselbeck took a jab at Andrews' revealing outfits, saying that if the man had waited he would have saved himself jail time. The next day she issued a tearful apology to Andrews saying she did not mean to belittle the crime. November 2011Bill Maher said on his show that since CBS journalist Lara Logan returned from Egypt after being sexually assaulted, America should send Elisabeth in her place. The comedian was a guest on The View and she took the chance to berate him over the incident.
