The Duke of Cambridge cheered on Wales as they conceded 15-24 to South Africa in the final of the Prince William Rugby Cup.

It is the seventh time the heir's side have conceded in the Autumn International since the cup was created in 2007.

William, vice patron of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), arrived at Millennium Stadium in high spirits this afternoon predicting a 'brutal' match.

He was greeted by 74,000 fans, former 
injured players, and the Welsh First Minister after flying in toÂ  the city's Heliport.

Frustration: Manager Sam Warburton said: 'There was genuine belief we could win. It wasn't to be.'

He was taken to admire a 5ft 4in portrait of the Queen in the stadium by Cardiff-born artist Dan Llywelyn Hall before greeting the former players who make up the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust, of which he is a patron.

He discussed the upcoming match with around 20 players - as well as his son Prince George.

Dennis Gethin, WRU president and chairman of the trust, said: 'Prince William takes time to speak to
each one of them and it is certainly something which they and their 
families appreciate and cherish.'

He also met Owen Sheers, WRU's first artist in residence, who presented William with a copy of his book about the Welsh side, Calon.

Grateful: William clutched the gift with both hands as he walked with Dennis Gethin back onto the pitch

Speaking afterwards, Mr Sheers said: 'It makes a big difference to the players to have Prince William's vote of confidence.

'He is a big rugby fan and to have him here supporting Wales today is fantastic.'

Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones gave William a present for son Prince George - a certificate for initiative Plant!, which plants a tree for every child born or adopted in Wales.

Mr Jones said the Duke, who lived in Anglesey, and his family would always have a 'welcome home in Wales'.

Proud: William, vice patron of the Welsh Rugby Union, praised the 'special' side. After arriving at the Millenium Stadium today, he discussed the match with WRU chair David Pickering (left) and CEO Roger Lewis (centre)

'By planting trees for this new generation we are providing them with personal links to the environment and creating local, native woodlands that can be enjoyed for generations to come,' he said.

'While Prince George was not born in Wales, we have planted a tree in honour of the time his parents spent here and the fact the family will always have a welcome home here in Wales.'

For the game, William sat between Mr Gethin and James Stoffberg, the vice president of the South African Rugby Union.

After the match, he presented the cup to the away side.

Heritage: The heir to the throne met former players before taking his seat for the Autumn International

Dennis Gethin, WRU president, said: 'Prince William takes time to speak to each one of [the former players] and it is certainly something which they and their families appreciate and cherish.'

In a statement before the match, 
William - who will present the Prince William Cup following the match - 
described the Welsh side as 'special'.

I am so proud to be vice-patron during what has been a truly memorable time. This is only the beginning of a great period for Welsh rugby.

-Prince William

'It has been an amazing year for Welsh
rugby with our triumph at the Six Nations and the Welsh contribution to
the British and Irish Lions' historic success in Australia,' William 
said.

'The final test, with its hugely 
convincing performance, had 10 Welsh players as starting Lions, which 
says something about how special this side currently is.

'I am so proud to be vice-patron of 
the Welsh Rugby Union during what has been a truly memorable time, and I
am sure that - given the strength of the squad - this is only the 
beginning of a great period for Welsh rugby.

Gushing: 'It has been an amazing year for Welsh rugby. I am so proud to be vice-patron of the union.'

'Sam Warburton's men will this 
afternoon look to build on their Six Nations triumph, with perhaps more 
than half an eye on next year's competition, and, while we are thinking 
big, the Rugby World Cup in 2015.

'This Springbok team has been lauded 
as one of the strongest in recent years and some of the pre-match 
commentary has predicted a 'brutal' encounter this afternoon.

'The Prince William Cup certainly 
pitches two of the best teams in the world right now against one another
for what I am sure will be an exciting and hard-fought match.'

William added that he was glad the WRU
was taking the time to honour veterans with poppies and a minute's 
silence, ahead of Remembrance Sunday.

'This is not an empty ceremony, repeated for the sake of form, but a living act of remembrance and gratitude,' he said.
