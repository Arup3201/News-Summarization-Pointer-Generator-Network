This is the incredible model railway that covers a couple’s entire home in Honiton, Devon.

The labour of love took over 10 years to
 construct and cost £32,000 - which the couple paid for themselves.

The remote-controlled train set is estimated to be the length 
of a football pitch (130 yards) and weaves all over their garden.

It took three tons of concrete and shale to lay the 
track in their back yard and they are constantly tinkering with it to make it
 bigger and better.

The set belongs to Roger Stimpson, 73, and his wife Barbara who have been collecting model trains for a decade in their three bedroom semi-detached house which costs £220,000.

Football pitch: Mr Stimpson stands in the middle of his handy work - which is estimated to be the length of a football field (130 yards)

Incredible detail: The railway has an incredible amount of detailed models in it - including a coach, tractor and train line

Over
 the years, their passion for trains has meant that their home has become crammed full of train sets.

The couple reveal that they have 
sets in their loft, garden and garage and have built each one by paying attention to every single detail.

Most of the track in the loft has been made from plywood and some of the
 models dotted around the set are handcrafted.

The
 model train-enthusiasts even have replicas of the Eurostar, First Great 
Western and a reproduction of Babbacombe Cliff Railway in Torquay among their fleet.

The couple's friend, Gary Broom helped the couple to put the set together in their garden.

He said: ‘I
 never had a particular interest in model trains before, but since I’ve 
been helping out here that has changed. I have been completely sucked 
into their world.

‘I haven't measured it but it must 
stretch the length of a football field by now. We put in the bridge overlooking the track and we extended the track itself the changes we have made 
over the last couple of weeks have really stepped it up.'

The train-set owners pair have been married for 53 years and have one daughter.

After building their ultimate set in their garden, Mr Stimpson decided he was keen to use it to raise funds for Devon Air Ambulance service.

The couple will 
open their home to the public to raise money for the service on June 15. Visitors will be admitted into the garden for free and the couple have organised a burger van and candy floss machine to provide 
food and drink on the day.

The generous 
couple have already held two similar fundraising events in the past, 
raising around £2,000 for the air ambulance service.

Local
 officials, Mayor David Foster and Town Crier Dave Retter are expected to be among 
the visitors in June.

However, the fundraising event also has special meaning for the couple.

Mr
 Stimpson suffers from Parkinson's and his wife has Motor Neurone 
disease and their ill-health has meant that they have both had to use the air ambulance service.

Mr
 Broom added: ‘They really are an exceptional couple and what they have 
managed to do with their garden is amazing.

‘It is all Barbara's design -
 without the old photographs she showed me I would not have known where 
to start in putting it all together.

‘They
 are not doing it because they have to - it is because they really want 
to do it. They have put so much into it and any donations on the day 
will be greatly appreciated.’

Mr
 Stimpson, a former electrician, said: ‘Being able to open up my garden 
is a great way for me to be able to give something back.’

Park: In this train set, people can be seen walking past a park, the couple spared absolutely no detail whilst putting the set together

Fun fair: A carousel, merry-go-round and helter skelter are all lined up behind a train that can be seen shooting past this beautiful scene

Leaves on the line: Mr Stimpson, a former electrician is looking forward to opening up his garden to show off his trains to visitors
