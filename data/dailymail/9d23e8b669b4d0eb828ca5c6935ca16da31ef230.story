American streaming site Netflix has secured exclusive Australian video on-demand subscription rights to the anticipated superhero television series Gotham, which suggests the site will be launching in Australia soon.

It's rumoured that the site could be preparing for an Australian launch in 2015. An estimated 200,000 already subscribe to U.S. streaming service using geoblocking software.

Gotham tells the story Bruce Wayne before he became Batman, and stars Ben McKenzie, Donal Logue and Jada Pinkett Smith.

Warner Bros confirmed to Sydney Morning Herald that Netflix had secured the SVOD rights to Gotham in Australia, while Nine Entertainment holds the broadcast, first-run, and in-season catch up rights to the show, which means Netflix will probably not be able to start streaming it until early 2015. 

The news comes as Nine and Fairfax Media look to launch their own joint-venture streaming service, reportedly called StreamCo, to rival the anticipated launch of Netflix in Australia. Seven Network has also confirmed it is preparing to launch its own streaming service.

There are further indications that Netflix is preparing for an Australian launch. On September 4, cable subscription service Foxtel removed it's basic cable package by halve to $25 per month, in what was seen by many analysts as pre-emptive strike ahead of a Netflix launch.

Chief executive of Australian streaming and DVD service Quickflix, Stephen Langsford, has continually campaigned against Netflix turning a blind-eye to Australian users using geoblocking software to access the US service.

In the US, Netflix costs $US 8.99 per month. There is not yet any indication of how much Netflix would charge if it launches in Australia.
