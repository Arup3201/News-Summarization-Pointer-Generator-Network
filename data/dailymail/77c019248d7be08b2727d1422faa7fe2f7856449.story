A construction worker has been hailed a hero for saving the life of a child whose dad then shot dead the youngster's mother and himself.

Sarah Drewer, 33, was killed by her estranged husband Douglas Drewer, 46, at their home in Scottsdale, Arizona, yesterday morning.

At least two construction workers heard the screams of a child coming from the house, which was being renovated, at around 8.30 a.m in a neighborhood near 68th Street and Chaparral Road close to downtown Scottsdale.

One of the workers ran into the home and found Drewer arguing with his wife over a handgun.

The worker wrestled the weapon from the husband and took the wife and child outside.

Seconds later Drewer later emerged from the home with a second handgun and told the worker to take the child away from the scene.

He did so before Drewer shot and killed his wife and then himself outside on the street. 

Emergency services descended on the scene on a clear morning in the suburban area of the city. 

Police Sergeant Ben Hoster said the man was 'a hero for saving that kid's life.'

According to azfamily.com, Scottsdale Police spokesman Kevin Watts called him a 'pretty brave individual to move to the aid of that child.

'It starts with him just hearing the screams for help and he moves across the street and enters the house.'  

Officers had recently dealt with domestic issues at the couple's home.

They served an order of protection on Drewer on Friday, took away several guns and ordered him to stay away from his wife and the home, Hoster said. 

The couple had a daughter and a son together, though it is not clear which child was present at the shooting

The scene was soon swarming with emergency services after the double shooting at around 8.30am

Police parked outside the couple's house. Their bodies lay out in the street after the shooting 

azcentral.com reported that a 2009 petition said Douglas Drewer had hit his wife in the past and had also been abusive toward her then three-year-old daughter, now thought to be aged seven. 

The order was issued more than a week after Sarah Drewer gave birth to their son, now five years old, according to the petition.

'He was screaming and throwing things,' she wrote. 

'He has a history of this sort of violent behavior, and I'm afraid for my children and me.' 

It is not clear which of the couple's two children was present at the shooting. 

Police took custody of that child, who was unharmed, and their sibling, who was not home at the time. 

Hoster said the construction worker would be protected under the state's good Samaritan laws despite entering the house without permission and fighting with the husband.
