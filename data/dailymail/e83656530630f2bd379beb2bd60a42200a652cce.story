Sony may have done as the hacking group Guardians of Peace wanted and cancelled the release of the upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview, but the leaked emails seem to keep on coming.

The latest batch have to do with Adam Sandler, and how much the studio does not care for the star, especially in the wake of his recent string of box office flops.

Things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges.

Friends no more: Amy Pascal  called Adam Sandler (above) an 'a**hole' on two occasions in new leaked emails

Not good: The first time Pascal called Sandler (above with Jennifer Aniston) an a**hole was after a meeting where he wanted to make a movie of the board game Candyland

The emails, obtained by The Daily Beast, first have to do with a film version of Candyland that Sandler wants to do, and his desire for the studio to give him$200million right off the bat to make that film.

Pascal is not okay with this. 

'Adam is an a**hole and this is more his fault than anyone’s but what we did was not communicate with each other and make assumptions,' Pascal says after the meeting in an email.

The studio again seems to have big problems with Sandler when he wants to get more money for his producing partner on the upcoming Hotel Transylvania 2.

Bad blood: Pascal again calls Sandler an 'a**hole' when he asks the studio for more money for his producing partner

Sandler reportedly wants Allen Covert, who produces and does voices on the film to get an extra $100,000. 

Raimo Kouyate, president of production for Sony Pictures Animation, says they will not pay more as they are already at the maximum they pay for executive producers, $500,000.

When he tells this to Pascal, she says of Sandler and Covert, 'They are such a**holes.'

Luckily, Sandler has left Sony for Netflix where he will now be working on four new films for the online streaming site.

He does however have two films left to be released at the studio, Transylvania and the upcoming Pixels, a film about video game experts who fight classic arcade villains when they try to take over New York City.
