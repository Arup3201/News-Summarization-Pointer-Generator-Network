A Finnish mentalist is up to some new tricks. Instead of playing mind games with humans he's decided to befuddle dogs.

Jose Ahonen, a magician and mentalist from Tampere, Finland puts treats in front of a dog's face and then makes it mysteriously disappear.

A video on Youtube that already has over half a million views shows Ahonen in action along with the adorable dogs Elsa, Taitso, Nakke, Gado, Nino, Dumle, Salli, and Tortsi.

Each dog handles the missing treat confusion in their own unique way, but none of them are pleased about losing their tasty morsel.

Jose Ahonen is a true trickster, so much so he's decided to test his tricks on the animal kingdom

Elsa rolls her head around in circles and sniffs to see if Ahonen is sitting on the treat

Taisto sticks out his tongue, sniffs around, does a turn, and goes off to look for the treat behind him

Nakke gives looks up, down, then all around and shoots a perplexed stare at the camera

Elsa rolls her head around in circles and sniffs to see if Ahonen is sitting on the treat.

Taisto sticks out his tongue, sniffs around, does a turn, and goes off to look for the treat behind him.

Nakke gives looks up, down, then all around and shoots a perplexed stare at the camera.

Gado sniffs under his own armpit for the treat in the hopes it is hiding somewhere in his fur.

The little dog Nino sniffs daintily under Ahonen's knees in search of the treat.

Dumle gives and angered stare at the camera but warms up afterwards and gives Ahonen a big sloppy kiss on the face.

Salli backs up and barks with disappointment.

Perhaps the most humorous reaction is Tortsi's who stares at Ahonen for a moment then simply runs away.

The video of tricks is quite an adorable treat.
