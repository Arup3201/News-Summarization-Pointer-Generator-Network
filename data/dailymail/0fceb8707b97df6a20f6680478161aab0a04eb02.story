Catholics don’t feel any guiltier about 'sexual sins' than members of other religions, a survey says.

Baptists, Muslims and Pentecostals feel the most guilt about using pornography, contraception and engaging in premarital or extramarital sex, which suggests that the concept of ‘Catholic guilt’ is false.

Sixteen per cent of religious people feel guilty about most or all of these four 'sexual sins', compared to only 3 per cent of those who do not belong to a religion, according to the poll by YouGov.

Some 14 per cent of Catholics said they would feel guilty across the range of the four 'sexual sins'.

The survey found that using contraception would make 9 per cent of those who are ‘nominal’ (by name only) Catholics and 12 per cent of practising Catholics feel guilty, reported the Guardian.

A big gap was found when considering attitudes towards premarital sex, which would make 20 per cent of religious people feel guilty - compared to only 5 per cent of the non-religious.

Meanwhile, using pornography for sexual stimulation would make 15 per cent of non-religious people feel guilty, which is less than half the figure of religious people, at 33 per cent.

Those belonging to the ‘least guilty’ bracket are men who are confident that their own judgment is authoritative, do not belong to any religion and are sure that there is no God.

But the ‘guiltiest’ people are women who rely on religious sources for their authority in life, belong to a religion and are certain that a God exists.

More than 4,000 adults were polled for the survey from January 25 to 30, reported the Guardian.

The findings match the discovery of a 1988 study in the Journal of Rational-Emotive and Cognitive-Behavior Therapy, which found no difference in guilt levels between denominations, reported Time.
