A poet has lost 5st after challenging his father to a weight loss competition.

Sven Stears, 25, from Maidstone in Kent, dropped from 17st to 12st in just six months by joining Diet Chef.

He says that since the weight loss he feels hugely more confident and that it has cured his crippling IBS.

Mr Stears told MailOnline: ‘I feel a thousand times better – I can’t believe it took me so long to realise what was wrong with my life and to fix it.

‘It was a journey of acceptance – I accepted that I was overweight and that it would be hard to lose the weight but I knew that I could do it.

‘I wanted to be able to look in the mirror and to know that I can be proud of my body.’

Mr Stears was a healthy weight, if a little stocky, until his late teens.

He then got a job in a pub and started to pile on the pounds rapidly.

He says he was working unusual hours and eating at strange times and that this caused him to gain weight.

Added to 
this, he says that in the pub he always had Coca Cola and Red Bull 
readily available so he drank far more than he should.

He said: ‘I was very unhealthy. You let it get you down but you turn a blind eye at the same time.

Mr Stears piled on the pounds while working in a pub because he ate at unsociable hours and drank a lot of fizzy drinks because they were too readily available behind the bar

Mr Stears lost the weight by joining Diet Chef - he had a weight loss competition with his father, Terry, and was determined to win. In the end, he lost 5st and his father lost 3st

‘It was half acceptance and half denial. You don’t see yourself as as fat as you are.’

Mr Stears, who earns a living by performing his poetry and holding workshops in schools, also developed IBS as a result of his poor diet and his weight.

As a result, he says he would often be doubled over in pain behind his bar.

He added: ‘It was very bad but at the time I didn’t see the IBS as connected to my diet and weight.’

Mr
 Stears explained that at this point he would eat a bacon, sausage and 
egg baguette for breakfast followed by a sandwich for lunch.

BEFORE

Breakfast - A bacon, sausage and egg baguette washed down with a whole carton of orange juice.

Lunch - A sandwich.

Dinner - Yorkshire pudding with chips, cheese and gravy.

Snacks - A lot of chocolate.

Drinks - Three cans of Red Bull, a can of Lucozade, two cans of Dr Pepper and two to three pints.

AFTER

Breakfast - porridge made with milk and one glass of orange juice.

Lunch - Soup with some bread.

Dinner - A Diet Chef curry with rice.

Snacks - Popcorn.

Drinks - One fizzy drink, water, black coffee and black tea (both with no sugar)

He says he would then have a Yorkshire pudding with chips, cheese and gravy for dinner.

He would also snack on chocolate and each day drank three cans of Red Bull, a can of Lucozade, two cans of Dr Pepper and a whole carton of orange juice.

Most days he also had two or three pints of beer after work.

However, everything changed when Mr Stears developed a very bad case of tonsillitis about a year ago.

He was so ill that he was barely able to eat and he lost a stone.

When he recovered, he piled the weight straight back on again and then says he was disappointed with himself as he felt he had missed an opportunity to kick start a diet.

But then, he lost his job in the pub and realised he no longer had any excuse not to lose weight.

He moved back in with his parents and his father, Terry, suggested that they start following a Diet Chef programme.

Mr Stears said: ‘This got quite competitive. I missed my old diet for a while but for me it had to be all or nothing – and I wanted to beat my dad!’

As a result, Mr Stears started eating nothing but Diet Chef meals.

He now eats porridge with milk for his breakfast, soup and some bread for lunch and a Diet Chef curry for his dinner.

He snacks on popcorn and drinks one fizzy drink and one glass of orange juice a day.

Otherwise, he just drinks water and black tea with no sugar.

Mr Stears says that he used only to be able to cycle for 10 minutes but that he now cycles to work and that this has helped his weight loss.

He now weighs a healthy 12st after losing 5st and he also beat his father who lost 3st.

Mr Stears (pictured before his weight loss) says he feels 'a thousand times better' now

He said: ‘Losing weight became a goal and an objective. I kept beating my target weight and that kept me going.’

He added: ‘Diet Chef made it easier to stick to it.’

Mr Stears says his IBS has now all but disappeared and that he feels far more confident.

He also explained that people’s amazed reactions when they saw him helped motivate him.

He said: ‘People’s reactions were amazing. People thought I was lying when I told them who I was.

‘People have been flabbergasted – other people’s reactions have made it worthwhile.’

Mr Stears says he now intends to stay on Diet Chef for a few more months before reverting to normal meals.

He added that he now feels he has lost enough weight and wants to concentrate on becoming more muscular.

As a result, he intends to start increasing his protein intake and working out.
