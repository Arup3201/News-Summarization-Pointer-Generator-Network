A Brooklyn man has been arrested and charged with stabbing to death his wife and her lover after catching the pair naked and having sex in a parked car.

The grisly double homicide played out in East New York at around 1am Wednesday, when police say Steve Whittingham, 48, killed his wife, Jonelle Barker, 36, and 35-year-old Jerome Barrett, according to police.

All three worked as baggage handlers at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Love triangle tragedy: Steve Whittingham, 48, has been charged with first- and second-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of his wife and her lover  

Bloody outcome: Jerome Barrett, 35 (left), was found lying naked in a pool of his own blood outside a Brooklyn building. His lover Jonelle Barker, 36 (right), was discovered stuffed inside a car trunk  

Investigators say Whittingham stabbed his romantic rival and his unfaithful wife in the chest multiple times.

Before succumbing to his wounds, Barrett was able to scramble out of his car without any clothes on, stumble to the front door of a building at Louisiana Avenue and Seaview Avenue and try to call for help, but it was too late, reported the New York Daily News. 

Barrett was found a short time later lying in a pool of his own blood. His clothes and wallet were discovered nearby.

Steve Whittingham surrendered to police Wednesday and was charged with first-degree and second-degree murder.

At around 3.30am Thursday, Barrett's 2009 Kia was discovered parked on New Lots Avenue in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.

Crime scene: The knife attack took place on Louisiana Avenue where Whittingham discovered his wife having sex with Barrett, his co-worker, in a parked car 

When police opened the trunk of the vehicle, they discovered Jonelle Barker's naked body stuffed inside.

1010 WINS reported that on Tuesday Whittingham got a phone call instructing him to drive to the corner of Louisiana and Seaview avenues, where he caught his wife and his co-worker Barrett, who was also married, in the act.

When questioned by police, Whittingham claimed that it was Barrett who came at him with a knife first, and that he wrestled the weapon out of his hands. 

Loss: The 36-year-old was also married. He was expected to travel to Virginia this weekend for his father's funeral 

Police say after stabbing Barrett and Barker, Whittingham loaded her body into the trunk of her lover's car, which he later abandoned in Brownsville.

But the suspect told detectives that when he took off, his wife was still alive, reported CBS New York.   

Barrett''s brother, who lives in Virginia, said they had lost their father to cancer just last week and the 35-year-old was expected to attend the funeral this weekend.

Now, the family will be planning a second funeral for the slain son.
