With mere weeks until she joins Team GB for the World Equestrian Games in Normandy, Zara Phillips is once again back in the saddle.

The former Olympic equestrian took part with her horse High Kingdom at CHIO Aachen World Equestrian Festival in Aachen on Friday.

The Queen’s granddaughter looked confident and robust in the saddle, dressed all in white to fend off the stifling midday heat.

The CHIO Aachen World Equestrian Festival in Aachen is one of the events the mother-of-one is competing in in the run up to World Equestrian Games in Normandy

Just last week the 33-year-old competed at the Dauntsey Park Horse Trials in Wiltshire, while her six-month-old baby daughter Mia looked on from the side lines.

On Friday however, there was no sign of Mia as Zara focused on honing her craft.

Zara's riding career, put on hold during her pregnancy and for the first few months of Mia's life, is slowly cranking back into top gear as the World Equestrian Games approach.

Earlier this month, Zara took to the field at the Barbury Horse Trials near Marlborough - with baby Mia once more among the crowds.

Late June saw her enjoy a successful day at the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire, watched by husband Mike Tindall, 36, and another outing at the Hopetoun Horse Trials in Edinburgh.

Now settled into motherhood, it seems Zara's determination to win has not been softened by any sleepless nights cause by six-month-old Mia

Having won a silver medal in the 2012 Olympics, Zara’s passion for riding is well known.

But she courted some controversy during her pregnancy with first child Mia when she continued to ride well into her second trimester.

Now settled into motherhood, it seems Zara’s determination to win has not been softened by sleepless nights, her ambition no doubt bolstered by the knowledge that scouts for the 2016 Rio Olympic games will be watching the World Equestrian Games.
