He is an adrenaline junkie who loves nothing more than scaling high structures to get great views.

And freerunner James Kingston decided to take viewers with him on his latest challenge, filming himself climbing a 250ft crane in Southampton.

The 24-year-old climbs to the top of the crane, which is the highest point in Southhampton, and then stands at the highest point whilst holding the GoPro camera on a stick to capture the surrounding view.

The thrill seeker is hundreds of feet in the air and his lack of fear, poise and determination to get to the top is remarkable.

Mr Kingston smiles and he looks excited to capture the remarkable selfie. Speaking about his crane climb last year Mr Kingston explained what motivates him to take such extreme risks. 

During the recently released video, which has already been viewed over 145,000 times since it was uploaded on October 23, Mr Kingston completes another audacious stunt.

The footage was captured by Mr Kingston on a GoPro camera and the adventurer has stated that he always likes to take advantage of high structures in his city.

He said: 'I stayed at the top for around an hour enjoying the view, jumping around and capturing it all. I didn't plan to do anything really. All I wanted to do was get up there in time for sunrise.'

The risk-taker said he is not scared when he stands at the top of a crane.

He said: 'You can't afford to be scared when you're hanging by your finger tips. I did it for the adventure. Life's too short to be sat around worrying about your future. You have no time to waste!'

No Support: Mr Kingston then takes a huge risk by standing up unaided

It's not the first time Mr Kingston has scaled a crane in his home city.

Last year he hung form a 250ft structure with just one hand as he captured the terrifying challenge on camera.

It took him twenty minutes to climb to the dizzying heights and the video was subsequently viewed by over three million people. 

More of James' daring climbs can be found on his YouTube channel and stunning pictures on his Instagram. James can also be found on Facebook and Twitter.
