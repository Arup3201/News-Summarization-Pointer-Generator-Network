Half of British adults cannot be bothered to exercise, while one in four never eat fruit or vegetables, according to a shocking new study.

Instead of sticking to the so-called 'five-a-day' rule and ensuring they are physically fit, many British adults choose to live on a junk food and sugary drink diet while doing little to burn off the calories.

Despite a lackadaisical attitude towards their health, half of Britons say they are unhappy with their appearance, with most of those blaming a busy lifestyle and lack of money for their unhealthy diet.

The shocking figures were revealed in Aviva’s Health Check UK report, which was released today.

The study found that one in three 25 to 34-year-olds were officially overweight, with that figure rising to 50 per cent of all 35 to 44-year-olds.

That figure improves slightly in the over-55 age range, where only a quarter are overweight.

Despite a rising level of concern surrounding obesity in Britain, a third of those who fall into the category insist they were happy with their weight and feel fine physically.

The lack of interest in taking care of 
ones health stems from people prioritising their work and social life 
over exercise and a good diet, according to Aviva UK Health medical 
director Dr Doug Wright.

'The nation is falling woefully short of
 hitting the five-a-day target of fruit and ­veg and too many people are
 failing to fit proper exercise into their lives,' he told the Mirror.

'It’s about a subtle change in habits like swapping chocolate for an apple... Being ­overweight brings with it the potential for serious health ­conditions, yet people are living in denial by claiming they are in very good health,' he added.

'The risks are well known with ­conditions including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and even some types of cancer,' Dr Wright said.

Last week it was revealed that super-sized
 graves dedicated solely for obese people are set to be installed at a 
cemetery amid fears of a growing ‘obesity crisis’.

Plans
 for 30 super-sized plots - which will be 
near the road so undertakers don’t have far to carry the body - have been drawn up by council workers after 
larger graves were requested by funeral directors struggling to haul coffins over long distances in Sutton Bridge, 
Lincolnshire.

Sutton
 Bridge and Wingland Parish Council hopes to open a new three-acre 
burial ground next year because space is running out at the cemetery in 
the local church - where plots measure 9ft by 4ft.
