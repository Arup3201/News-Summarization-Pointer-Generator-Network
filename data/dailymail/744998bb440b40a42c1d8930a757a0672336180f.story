She's a swimwear model and fashion muse known for her lithe figure but Abbey Clancy maintains that she does 'zero exercise' to stay in shape.

The Strictly Come Dancing champion - who has three-year-old daughter Sophia Ruby with husband Peter Crouch - claims she doesn't have to work out a lot to maintain her enviable figure.

She does, however, admit that she's been taking yoga classes since becoming pregnant with their second child.

Abbey Clancy, who is three months pregnant with her second child, says she does 'zero' exercise to maintain her petite frame

Quizzed on the secrets behind her bikini body, she told The Telegraph: 'Zero exercise. Everyone in my family is slim and tall. My mother bounced back after kids, my brother's skinny - so I think my genes are a huge part of it.

'When I did Strictly, it didn't feel like exercise but it was super intense, and I saw my body really change - I lost my boobs completely. But now I've gone back to nothing, and a more flabby body.'

The 29-year-old confessed that along with no exercising - apart from pregnancy yoga to strengthen her 'pelvic floor and lower back' before the baby arrives - she also has no rules about what she can and can't eat.

She added: 'I live with a footballer, so we tend to eat healthily. But I'm so relaxed about it - we don't deny ourselves of anything. If I want a Chinese or a McDonald's, I'll have one.'

Abbey has a number of beauty products she swears by, revealing: 'I love Charlotte Tilbury's foundation in Light Wonder, number six. It's so sheer but still gives good coverage. 

'I love Bare Minerals concealer, and I can't live without Lancôme mascara. I love all my lotions and potions and I'm lucky to be sent lots of things, but the truth is I've used the same stuff for years really.'

Abbey certainly inherited her good genes from her 54-year-old mother, Karen, who shows off her timeless look in JD Williams' new fashion campaign. 

Karen, a single mother to four children, was tapped by the high street brand to front a new campaign styled by former iD fashion editor, Caryn Franklin.

Melissa Bell, mother to former X Factor winner and pop star Alexandra Burke, also stars. Melissa was the lead singer in legendary Eighties group Soul II Soul.

Also joining the trio is Janet Ellis, mother to singer Sophie Ellis Bexter. Television presenter and actress, Janet is best known for presenting BBC children’s television programmes, Blue Peter and Jigsaw. 

Making up the five is Ruby Hammer, mother to founder of Urban Retreat, Reena Hammer. 

Ruby is an internationally acclaimed make-up artist and co-founder of cosmetic brand Ruby & Millie.
