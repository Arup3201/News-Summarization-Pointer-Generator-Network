Princeton Mom Susan Patton has waded into the campus rape debate, saying sexual assault 'really is a clumsy hook-up melodrama'.

Ms Patton, who sparked uproar earlier this year by saying young women should dedicate time at college to 'finding a husband', said rape victims should question how they had come to be in a situation where they could be attacked.

Saying rape could be a 'learning experience' for female students, Ms Patton's remarks caused controversy again as she leapt to the defence of accused rapists.

Princeton Mom Susan Patton waded into the college debate, saying sexual assault was often a 'clumsy hook-up melodrama'

Speaking to Carol Costello on CNN, Ms Patton said there was more than one type of rape.

She said: 'We're now talking about or identifying as rape what really is a clumsy hook-up melodrama or a fumbled attempt at a kiss or a caress. In many cases this is what it is.

'It makes one wonder, why don't you [rape victims] get up and leave? Why, as a woman, do you not tell a man who is making advances you're not comfortable with, "Stop. Leave". 

'There's rape and then there's rape.' 

Wading into the campus rape debate which has raged in colleges since last month, when Rolling Stone magazine published the account of a female student at the University of Virginia (UVA) who claims she was gang raped, Ms Patton said men accused of sexual assault were treated as if they were guilty.

'Any young man on any college campus who is accused of having sexually assaulted a woman starts from the position of being guilty until they can prove their own innocence,' she said. 

In an interview with CNN's Carol Costello (right), Ms Patton questioned why rape victims did not tell men making advance they are not comfortable with to stop

Clearly uncomfortable with Ms Patton's comments, Costello asked: 'If your daughter gets horribly drunk and a man takes advantage of her sexually, and she’s passed out drunk… she deserves it?'

Ms Patton replied that women should 'stay sober enough' to leave a situation if things get out of hand.

Asked if she was suggesting women should change their behavior, rather than teaching men not to rape, the Princeton Mom replied: 'We could teach burglars not to steal, but better advice: Lock your door.' 

The Rolling Stone article sent shockwaves through the university community after the magazine published Jackie's account of being gang-raped by seven men at a UVA fraternity two years ago.

Misrepresented? These are the three friends who ran to alleged rape victim Jackie's aid, the night she told Rolling Stone she was gang raped by seven men at the University of Virginia. Identified as Cindy, Andy and Randall in the article, they say their real names are Kathryn Hendley (left), Alex Stock (center) and Ryan (asked for his last name to be withheld, right)

Next to Jackie's account of the horrifying assault, one of the most appalling aspects of the story were the apathetic reactions of her three friends 'Randall', 'Andy' and 'Cindy', who she called for help after escaping the fraternity that night in September 2012.

According to the magazine, the victim said her friends told her to 'remember where your loyalty lies', and that she should not open UVA to criticism.

Today they came forward to refute claims made in the article, insisting that they urged Jackie to report the incident to police, but that she declined.
