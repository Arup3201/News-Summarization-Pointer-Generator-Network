When Jack Wilshere signed his first long-term contract at Arsenal in the summer of 2009, there was a real sense of excitement around the club.

Wilshere was already the Gunners' youngest ever player in the league, and although he had played just six minutes of top-flight football, there was a belief around the Emirates that he was the future.

What they did not see coming was the amount of time he would spend out injured.

Back in 2009, Arsene Wenger spoke glowingly of his young star: 'At still 17 years of age, the potential is huge for Jack and we’re all delighted that he has committed his long-term future to Arsenal Football Club.' 

Wilshere came off the bench in two Champions League games that autumn, completed 90 minutes in the League Cup, and made a Premier League appearance in a win over Birmingham. The world, it seemed, was at his feet.

But, just as the teenager was building some momentum, he picked up his first injury, an ankle knock that kept him out of first team action for six weeks.

The midfielder bounced back, making his full Premier League debut in early February, and playing a part in 15 league games that season. 

But since that first injury five years ago, Wilshere has been plagued by ankle complaints, missing more than 100 weeks of football with various injuries.

With his latest set-back possibly requiring yet more surgery, Wilshere could be out until March, at which point he will have missed 119 weeks with injury in five years - meaning the young star has been injured an incredible 43 per cent of his Arsenal career.

During that time the 22-year-old has racked up 95 Premier League appearances, which may seem a lot at his age but it is just a fraction of what Wenger would have hoped for.

Wilshere has had hip, hamstring and back injuries over the last five years, but the vast majority of his issues have been with his ankles, which will, by the time he returns, have ruled him out of almost 112 weeks of football. 

Wilshere missed the entirety of Euro 2012 during his longest spell on the sidelines, which lasted 65 weeks

The star has been out for 119 of the last 279 weeks, an astonishing 43 per cent of the time

Perhaps the only positive from Wilshere’s latest injury is that it did not occur on his right ankle, which has previously required surgery. ‘It does not look good,’ admitted Arsenal manager Wenger.

‘There is no bone damage but there is ligament damage. It is just how [long] it is, which we should know next week.'

Even in a best case scenario, it is another sad chapter in the sorry tale of missed opportunity that is Jack Wilshere's injury-stifled career to date.
