It is not the most delicate dinner party accessory but it means guests won't have to wait while you wrestle with a traditional corkscrew to serve them a glass of wine. 

Thanks to one company's new invention, you can open a bottle in seconds with a gadget that will also come in handy for DIY jobs around the house. 

The Skil Power corkscrew works as an electric screw driver but it also comes equipped with a corkscrew attachment, which snugly fits on to your favourite bottle of Pinot Noir.

Not just a drinking gadget: The screwdriver also comes with a foil cutter, wine stopper and a five piece tool set

Like any other electric screw driver it has forward and reverse functions and holds a charge for 18 months. 

It whirs at 200rpm so opening a cheeky red can be done in seconds - though, due to the noise, not on the sly. 

Perhaps designed for the discerning handyman or builder who likes to relax after a hard days drilling with a cold glass of Chardonnay, it should be noted that combining the drills two uses is a safety hazard and not advisable.

Another obvious concern is that, after imbibing the first bottle, opening subsequent bottles with a power tool may well result in smashed glass and spilled alcohol.  

The screw also comes with a foil cutter, wine stopper and a rather high tech five piece tool set.

But for £50, many may feel that the old fashioned version, which usually will set you back only about £5, will fulfill their drinking needs just fine.
