A video of a circus show where rollerskating baboons and skipping bears are forced to perform up to three times a day, has emerged from North Korea.

The footage has been greeted with horror by animal welfare groups, who declared that the show 'has no place in civilised society.'

Filmed in secret by a western visitor to the country, the clip shows how the Communist pariah state still allows the type of animal shows banned in most of the world generations ago.

Cruel footage: Forced to perform up to three times a day, the video has been greeted with horror by animal welfare groups

As a bear skips over two sets of skipping ropes in a gaudy outfit, one of the ropes catches his fur  and he shudders, backing away quickly from the trainers.

But they force him to continue jumping up and down in a cruel fashion.

The baboons, dressed in blue and white jumpsuits, are forced to skate down a slide on roller blades, and throwing balls into basketball nets.

Life of misery: The bears are caught in the forests of North Korea and trained for the show

Tickets to the Pyongyang show, cost up to £16 each – compared to the average North Korean worker’s monthly salary of £29. 

This means that only privileged members of the military can afford this type of expensive entertainment – as shown by the almost entirely green uniformed audience.

The 3,500 onlookers smiled and laughed as the bears followed the commands of their trainers – eventually showing their approval with synchronised clapping at the end of the performance.

Animal rights campaigns PETA reacted angrily to the video, and told the MailOnline the animal performance shows were 'outdated.'

'There’s nothing funny about tearing primates away from their protective mothers shortly after birth and forcing them to perform silly tricks.

'These highly social animals suffer from debilitating loneliness and depression when isolated from other monkeys.

A spokesperson also said that many of the animals retaliate and are known to bite people.

'Many bear cubs taken from the wild die before the training begins because of the stress of capture, the gruelling transportation conditions, starvation, dehydration and rough handling.

'The ones who survive have the tops of their muzzles pierced with hot needles and a rope threaded through the holes – they are then forced to stand on their hind legs and perform under threat of punishment.

'These and other animal acts are outdated and have no place in any civilised society.'
