Claudio Bravo has arrived at his new club Barcelona following Chile's departure from the World Cup.

Bravo, who agreed a move to the Catalan giants in June from Real Sociedad, will take a medical and sign his contract on Monday before giving a press conference.

The 31-year-old, who returned home to Spain after Chile’s defeat to Brazil on penalties last week, posed for pictures in front of the club's crest on Sunday, and will sign until 2018.
