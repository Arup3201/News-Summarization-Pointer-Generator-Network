She launched an extraordinary attack on the fashion world and hit out at fashion bible Vogue after the American edition claimed she fell asleep during an interview, but Cara Delevingne may well be regretting her tirade now.

The 21-year-old has been revealed as British Vogue's new cover girl and graces the September issue - the glossy magazine's most prestigious edition.

Writing about the upcoming issue on its website, Vogue says: 'The biggest that we have ever published - and with more fashion shoots than ever before - the September issue brings all of the autumn/winter 2014 collections to the fore for the first time, making us almost wish for the first leaf to fall (or at least start to prepare sartorially for when it does).

Look who it is! Cara Delevingne has been revealed as British Vogue's new cover girl and graces the September issue - the glossy magazine's most prestigious edition

'Inside, Delevingne is photographed by Mario Testino, making the most of her gamine frame and Sixties ingénue looks to showcase the coming season's most desirable pieces.'

Described by the magazine as 'fashion's most talked about girl', this is the third time in 18 months that Cara has fronted the magazine.

Clearly shot before Cara
 described the fashion industry as 'not the most understanding or 
compassionate of industries', the young supermodel looks flawless posing
 in a 60s inspired outfit on the cover of the 462-page issue wearing 
new-season Louis Vuitton.

A few weeks ago, Cara lashed out at the fashion world in a well-documented Twitter tirade.

It all stemmed from a piece that American Vogue's Plum Sykes wrote that claimed that the party-loving model was late for their meeting.

She also said that the 21-year-old requested a massage prior to their interview and fell asleep, causing the meeting to be cut short.

Sykes explains that Cara was in pain from too much kickboxing and wanted the pair to enjoy a massage before the interview so that they could both be 'relaxed.' Sykes was left waiting half an hour after the massage ended, only to be informed that Cara had fallen asleep.

In her article about the episode, Sykes writes: 'Cara finally appears, looking refreshed after her rest. “I’m so sorry!!!” she exclaims, collapsing into a chair. “I fall asleep everywhere! Someone recently asked if they could publish a book of pictures of me sleeping, because there are so many.”

Cara’s personal assistant then informed Sykes that Cara wasn't hanging around or going to Hackney City Farm with her as they had planned and was instead off to do some film recording, followed by hair and make-up, a fitting for her Met ball outfit with Stella McCartney, a Fendi-store launch party, all rounded off by dinner with Karl Lagerfeld.

Sykes goes on to explain that she then called photographer Tim Walker, who has worked with Cara many times, only to be told by him that on every shoot he's done with her, Cara's fallen asleep (even snoozing for seven whole hours on a Mulberry shoot.)

Speaking out: Cara took to Twitter to explain to her 1.7m followers that the fashion industry 'is not the most understanding or compassionate' of industries

Sykes discovers that Cara had been out partying with Lily Allen the night before their meeting and later calls Cara to ask about her love of a good night out and her resulting reputation.

'Well, the going out is more to do with the fact that I am literally jet-lagged all the time,' Cara told Sykes.

'I can’t sleep in the evenings. Most of the pictures people see of me are me going to work events: a Fendi dinner one night, a Prada dinner the next, and working all day.

'Actually, compared to anyone else my age that I know, I really go out so little,' she tells her.

The article was posted in the early hours of the morning on June 25 and Cara was quick to respond.

Cover girl: While Cara has featured on the glossy cover of British Vogue, Cara doesn't appear to be too happy with the American version after the article they wrote about her

She took to Twitter and wrote: 'Why do people in the industry lie so much???? They would rather see you fail than succeed. What happened to supporting each other? It’s even worse when your [sic] trying to fight people that have all the power because then you are powerless.

'All I can say is I work extremely hard and ‘sleeping’ is proof that sometimes I work too hard. I apologise for being so ambitious. This just shows that the fashion industry is not the most understanding or compassionate of industries.

'That only applies to the people that sit around not really caring and never really bothering to get to know you or what it’s really like. What happened to supporting each other?'.

Motivational message: Cara shared an inspirational quote on her Instagram page after her Twitter rant about the offending article

In little more than 
two years, Cara has reached
supermodel status, 
but in a 
recent interview she seemed a tad downbeat about her chosen industry.

While she acknowledges her ‘luck’ at having achieved so much in such a short space of time, she told Alexis Petridis of The Guardian that young girls should be aspiring for careers that are more intellectually demanding.

When asked what she’d do if her daughter 
wanted to become a model, she replied: ‘I’d say no, if that’s all she 
aspired to. You know, I get a lot of girls who say, I just want to be a 
model so badly. And I think: You can do better than that.

‘I mean, look, I do love it, I’m not saying anything bad about it, I just think you can do a lot more.’

She
adds: ‘I was incredibly lucky to do as well as I’ve done, it’s not 
easy, there’s so many models go through so much s**t, and it’s just, if 
you have a brain, which everyone does, use it and try and do something 
else.’

Success: Cara Delevingne's fortunes have changed
drastically over the last two years. From comparatively humble 
beginnings as a fashion intern at Asos, she is now one of the world's 
most successful, and sought after young models 

Cara’s ascent began in the offices of 
fashion website Asos in 2012, where she was ‘discovered’ by Burberry’s 
Christopher Bailey while working as an intern. 

‘As
a model, I really stand for not being a model, if that makes sense,’ 
she said.  ‘When I started, the whole idea of the model was very 
different, it was a bit stuck-up. Not stuck-up, but no one was trying to
have fun, or not even have fun, but be willing to smile.’

That
smile, allied with a series of comedic expressions, has become 
something of a trademark - and a magnet for the cameras that follow her 
every move.

What's 
more, the star admits she would love to quit modelling herself one day 
and go away and make a music album for six months.

She said: 'That's what I'd f**king love to do. And when this shit doesn't work out, yeah, I will block that out and do it.'
