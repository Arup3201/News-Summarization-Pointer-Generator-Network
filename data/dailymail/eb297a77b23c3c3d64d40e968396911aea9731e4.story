New research has indicated that Australian sports are sending out an unhealthy message through the vast majority of its sponsors which produce unhealthy products.

Research conducted by Rona Macniven from the University of Sydney has revealed that 39 sports organisations, out of the 53 which are supported by the Australian Sports Commission, have at least one sponsor that distributes unhealthy commodities, Fairfax reports.

The results of the audit, which were presented at a conference organised by Sports Medicine Australia on Wednesday, revealed that cricket was the worst offender.

Research conducted by Rona Macniven from the University of Sydney found that cricket  was the sport with the most amount of 'unhealthy' sponsors 

Represented by Cricket Australia, the sport was revealed to have 19 fast food companies as sponsors including KFC and Coca Cola, 10 alcohol manufacturers including VB and Carlton, and one gambling operator, Bet365.

The audit concludes that more than a quarter of its sponsors are made up of these unhealthy companies.

But despite Ms Macniven dubbing unhealthy sponsorships in sport 'a paradox', Cricket Australia has defended its alcohol company sponsors by arguing that removing them would be a 'simplistic approach'.

The audit found that 39 sports organisations, out of the 53 which are supported by the Australian Sports Commission, have at least one sponsor that distributes unhealthy products 

'Our research shows that it is better to engage with the reality that most fans enjoy a responsible drink than it is to turn them off with a prohibition message that they don't believe' a spokesperson told the Sydney Morning Herald.

But can the same 'responsible' intake level be suggested by AFL team the Western Sydney Wanderers, whose recently announced partnership with McDonald's raised eyebrows on Wednesday?

Part of the agreement will see the fast food giant offer a $9.95 Wanderers meal deal to customers that presents them with an intake of 6480kj – a quarter pounder, large soft drink and fires and six McNuggets.

Most recently, AFL team the Western Sydney Wanderers recently announced their partnership with McDonald's which will see the release of the Wanderers meal deal

AFL and Rugby League took out the second prize for the highest number of unhealthy sponsors, according to the audit.

Sponsors listed on the AFL's official website include Coca Cola, Carlton Draught, Mars, Hungry Jacks and Four'n Twenty while NRL lists VB, Coca Cola, and KFC on their website.

Overall, the research reviewed 1975 sponsors across 413 sport organisation's websites and found 10 per cent were unhealthy.
