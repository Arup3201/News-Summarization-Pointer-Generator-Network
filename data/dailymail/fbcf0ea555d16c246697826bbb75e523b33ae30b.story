A morbidly obese 13-year-old girl who weighed more than 200lbs has managed to lose more than a third of her body weight after undergoing gastric surgery in March. 

Alexis Shapiro, from Cibolo, Texas, suffered from a rare condition called hypothalamic obesity, a disease which leaves sufferers feeling constantly hungry and saw the teenager put on more than 150lbs over a two year period.

But after undergoing a complex surgical procedure to reduce the size of her stomach, she is now happily on the road to recovery - and is, according to her mother, looking and feeling healthy for the first time in years.

'We began 2014 in the darkest, lowest place,' Jenny Shapiro told the Today show. 

'But as the months rolled by, we slowly climbed up the mountain. Today, we get to see the pretty view. My daughter, Alexis, is healthy. We have not been able to say that for a long time.'

Alexis' condition was first brought to light in 2011, after her insurance company denied her parents' request to allow her to undergo a gastric bypass - which they believed would help her to fight her condition and, ultimately, save her life. 

Desperate to ensure that their daughter receive the necessary medical treatment, Alexis' parents began an online campaign to raise the money that would pay for the surgery. 

The campaign proved to be an incredible success - and saw donations pouring in from generous supporters around the world, eventually raising more than $80,000.

And now, eight months after undergoing the gastric sleeve procedure, Alexis is back at school and working towards a full recovery - and is even able to take part in organised sports and physical activities, something which two years ago seemed an impossibility.

'Alexis has been doing really good,' 35-year-old Jenny wrote on a Facebook page set up in support of her daughter. 'She still doesn't like going to school and gives me a hard time sometimes but she tries her best.

'She gets very very tired from school. She likes math, reading, and language arts. She doesn't like music, or computers. She likes learning! She walks about a half mile or more everyday at school. 

'She is still scared to try new things that she couldn't do while she was much heavier, but we are trying. Thank you everyone for caring!'

But Jenny makes clear that her daughter still has a long way to go, writing in a piece for the Today show : 'This is not the spot where we’ll finish our journey. 

'But from here, we can see life so much better. Before, something enormous was blocking our view: We didn’t know how much longer we had with Alexis. Today, we see her future.'
