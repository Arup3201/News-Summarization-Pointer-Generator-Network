Victims: Debra Leggio, 60 and her husband Vincent Leggio, 64, were killed when their 2007 Chevrolet SUV was struck by an 18-wheeler

The family of Vincent and Debra Leggio has been tragically torn apart after the couple was killed on Thanksgiving day in a massive 140-car pileup along a busy Texas interstate.

Debra Leggio, 60 and her husband, 
Vincent Leggio, 64, were killed when their 2007 Chevrolet SUV was struck
 by an 18-wheeler, according to authorities. The Leggios were 
grandparents and residents of Pearland, Texas, where Vincent worked as 
an electrician.

The Leggio family is one of hundreds affected by the string of collisions Thursday that left  trucks and family SUVs twisted atop one another and authorities rushing to pull survivors from two miles of wreckage along a busy Texas highway.

At least 80 people were hospitalized as a result of the collisions, which began with a single wreck around 8:45 a.m. on Interstate 10 southwest of Beaumont, a
 Gulf Coast city about 80 miles east of Houston, as hundreds of drivers 
were heading to Thanksgiving holiday feasts.

A dense cloud of fog blanketing a 
section of the Texas interstate made it impossible for drivers to see 
the crash ahead of them, so other vehicles careened into the pileup and 
the devastation quickly multiplied. The chain reaction led to multiple crashes on the other side of the highway, as well.

Jefferson County sheriff's Deputy Rod Carroll said that 80 to 90 people were transported to hospitals with 10 to 12 of those in serious to critical condition. The most seriously injured were being transported to Houston, about 75 miles away.

Baptist Beaumont Hospital spokeswoman Mary Poole told KFDM News they had received at least 21 patients. One was in critical condition. The hospital transported two children and one adult with head injuries to a Houston hospital.

Both lanes of the highway were reopened by 4 p.m. Thursday.

Jefferson County Sheriff's Office Deputy Rod Carroll said the fog was so thick that deputies didn't immediately realize they were dealing with multiple accidents.

'We have 18-wheelers on top of cars, we have cars on top of cars. It's 
just catastrophic,' he said, adding that rescuers were still looking for
 victims.

He said the initial accidents took place separately about a mile apart on the east- and westbound sides of the interstate.

The highway had been crowded with motorists traveling during the 
Thanksgiving holiday. Many of the vehicles were moving close to the 
posted speed of 70 miles per hour despite dense fog that limited visibility, 
Carroll said.

Chief Charles Sonnier of the Labelle-Fannett Volunteer Fire Department told KFDM News the vehicles involved in the accidents include seven tractor trailers that collided on the eastbound side.

Two were carrying hazardous materials, but they weren't leaking, according to Sonnier.

Sonnier added that firefighters had to use the jaws of life to cut people out of a car and pickup truck.

Carroll said uninjured drivers tried to help as authorities sort through the wreckage.

'It's just people helping people,' 
Carroll said. 'The foremost thing in this holiday season is how other 
travelers were helping us when we were overwhelmed, sitting and holding,
 putting pressure on people that were injured.'

Video footage of the crash shows badly mangled vehicles atop one another and people who appeared to be injured stretched out in grass alongside the highway and on ambulance gurneys.

Long lines of cars, each battered and some appearing to be totaled, lined the roadway. The vehicles included cars, minivans, pickups, tractor-trailer trucks and several FedEx trucks.

Neighbors of the deceased couple told the Houston Chronicle that Debra and Vincent Leggio mostly kept to themselves.

'They were nice, quiet and conservative,' said Andrew Rubio, who said he has lived next door to the couple for about two and a half years.

Rubio said he believed Debra Leggio usually spent her days at home babysitting her grandchildren.

A relative of the couple posted on Facebook around 11:20 p.m.: 'Tell your family that you love them today. Hold them close and cherish every minute with them. Never let go of those good times and memories.'
