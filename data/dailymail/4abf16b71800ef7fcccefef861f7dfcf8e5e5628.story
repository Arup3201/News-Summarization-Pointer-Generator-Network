A man dubbed the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' has pleaded guilty in a Philadelphia court after being charged for flashing women while holding slices of Swiss cheese.

Christopher Pagano, 42, was charged with stalking, indecent exposure, harassment and lewdness for his crimes against four women in January.

Several of the victims were able to record video or take a photograph of Pagano as he harrassed them from his car while brandishing cheese.

Playing with food: Christopher Pagano's cheese fetish has hopefully come to an end since he pleaded guilty today

According to Philly.com, he would drive up to his victims, expose himself to them and ask them if they would like to be paid to engage in sex acts with him involving Swiss cheese.

Pagano, from Norristown, was arrested in January and pleaded guilty today.

He's been sentenced to eight years probation and must report to sex offender counseling

Furthermore, he may not use a car except to drive to work, church or medical appointments, for one year.

Pagano is a married father of a 12-year-old girl, reports Philly.com.

Cheesy: The Mayfair Town Watch warned women of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert,' pictured, on its Facebook page earlier this year

During their investigation, police 
unearthed court documents and a mugshot from 2009 reveal that Pagano was
 arrested after he allegedly 'removed a large block of cheese from his 
pocket' and asked a woman on the street if it would be alright to give 
her '$20 to rub the Swiss cheese on his penis.'

At the time of his 2009 arrest, Pagano pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct but a solicitation charge against him was dismissed.

Going
 back three years to 2006, Pagano was again arrested and charged with 
solicitation and disorderly conduct according to the Philadelphia 
Magazine.

The 
Norristown Police Department was unable to confirm that cheese was 
involved in this incident, however detective James Angelucci, who worked
 the 2006 and 2009 case said that he thought it was.

'I
 was working the 2006 detail as well,' said Angelucci. 'And I believe 
cheese was on the menu, but I’m not completely sure. If my memory serves
 me, it was Swiss.'

The bizarre case shocked many residents but Gabby Chest, from nearby Bridesburg, recognized the fetish straight away and made her own report to police.

In July 2012, when she was just 19, she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and within days had an inbox from a 'really strange guy' with a very specific request.

'He said he was looking for someone 
to perform masturbation on him with cheese,' Ms Chest told the Daily 
News. 'He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was
 to find someone to help him with them.'

She
 added: 'There's no doubt it was him; it looked exactly like the picture
 on his profile. I was scared and shocked. I never thought the guys you 
see on those sites would be so close to me.'

Hands up: Pagano was arrested at his home in Norristown at gunpoint in January

Dairy don't: The man dubbed the Swiss Cheese Pervert had been driving around and asking women if they'd like to pleasure him with a piece of cheese

In the message, the man called 
'Chris' explained he developed the fetish after struggling to find women
 and start relationships as a young man because he was overweight and 
always judged on his looks.

'So I developed this fetish to help me deal with my sexual urges,' he wrote.

'I found that women tend to like dairy products, and settled on cheese to represent the girl. thus I started having sex with cheese.'

Another woman, commenting on a Phillymag.com story, shared an OKCupid message her sister received from 'Chris' some four years ago, which was even more shocking.

'I love the way Swiss cheese feels against my penis. Either as slices of Swiss cheese being wrapped around my penis or a chunk of Swiss cheese being rubbed against my penis,' he wrote.

'I love even more when a woman uses the Swiss cheese to pleasure me. Or simply wraps Swiss cheese slices around my penis and allows me to hang out with her as I wear the cheese.'

He explained that he prefers having sex with cheese over traditional sex and jokes 'I am lucky I never became a rapist,' suggesting this was an alternative to his fromage infatuation.

Victim: A woman tweeted this picture of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' with the comment 'I met this dude a few weeks ago' #creep

Chis went on: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best. First and foremost, if ever a picture of cheese is used, most of the time they use a representation of Swiss cheese. But also because of it's eye patterns, texture, and the way it feels against my penis.'

While he didn't offer Ms Chest cash in exchange for the sexual favor, so as not to suggest she was a prostitute, he did offer this young woman $50 if she'd pleasure him using his preferred method.

He described in the expansive letter, however, that when he was younger he had far more stamina for cheese sex.

'I was able to wrap and wear a good 1 ½ pounds of Swiss cheese against my penis, and wear the Swiss cheese for hours at a time, before I would climax from just having the Swiss cheese on my penis,' Chris wrote.

But in a strange twist, he insists he doesn't like Swiss cheese, only mozzarella, and would never consumer the cheese he has used on himself.

'One last note, I do not like cheese, except for mozzarella, and that is the one cheese I have never used on myself,' he explained. 'So no I do not eat the cheese after I am done using it for pleasure, it is discarded. I am always asked that question.'
