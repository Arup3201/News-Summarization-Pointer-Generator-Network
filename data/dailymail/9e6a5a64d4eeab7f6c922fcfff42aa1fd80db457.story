It’s certainly a good story for this couple to tell at their wedding - and not just because she asked him.

Gillian Douse, 34, enlisted the help of illusionist Tom London, 21, to help her propose to boyfriend Bernie with a magic trick during his birthday meal at a Prezzo restaurant in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

The idea was that Miss Douse and Mr London would work to ‘magically’ reveal the engagement ring in a trick. The magician began by mingling around the restaurant and performing for other diners.

‘This was to give the illusion that I was the resident magician and in no way linked to Bernie’s birthday celebration,’ Mr London said today, following the trick he performed on Monday at 8pm.

Miss Douse had timed the evening so that dessert had been finished by the time Mr London was ready to perform at their table. The magician then began exhibiting a few close-up magic tricks.

He said: ‘We came up with the perfect routine that would leave Bernie speechless. When I originally read the enquiry I had an instant flush of anxiety. I had never performed under such pressure and just thinking about it made me nervous.’

After performing card tricks and changing
a borrowed £20 note into a £50 note, he began the proposal trick. 
Bernie was already wearing a ring on his ring finger, which Mr London 
took from him.

She then pulled out a small white box, to the amazement of her 
boyfriend.

Slowly opening the box, she revealed an engagement ring and asked her boyfriend, ‘Will you marry me?’ A shocked Bernie composed himself, smiled and leant in for a romantic kiss. He said ‘yes’.

The magician added: ‘It was wonderful, Gillian acted it out so well, Bernie really had no idea.’

Miss Douse told Mr London in a testimonial: 'Seeing his face when you helped me produce the ring was priceless. I couldn't think of a nicer person to have as part of that everlasting memory.'

Mr London, a University of Sussex student from Kent, has previously performed magic for the likes of presenter Jon Snow, broadcaster Chris Tarrant and Mark Wright from ITV’s The Only Way Is Essex.
