Family man: Pedro Maldonado, 53, shot dead his wife and 17-year-old son with a crossbow, attempted to kill his 21-year-old son and then took his own life

A South Florida man has used a crossbow to kill his wife and teenage son in their townhouse, drove across the state to try and murder his other son, and eventually committed suicide by slitting his own throat.

Broward Sheriff's Office deputies said the body of Pedro Jose Maldonado Sr., 53, of Weston was found inside the bathroom of a motel room near Lake City.

Before that, deputies said Maldonado called a friend to say he had killed his wife, 47-year-old Monica Narvaez-Maldonado, and son Pedro Jose Maldonado Jr., 17.

Both victims had been shot inside the family’s Vineyard Circle home with what deputies described as a handheld crossbow that fires small darts.

Deputies said Narvaez-Maldonado and her son were struck once in the head. Detective John Curcio said it does not appear that either victim put up a fight, Orlando Sun-Sentinel reported.

Toxicology tests will be performed to see if the mother and son had been drugged before the deadly attack.

Authorities believe they were killed sometime Monday. After that, they said, Maldonado got into his 2013 black Volvo SUV and drove some 460 miles to Tallahassee, where he rented a motel room.

Cruel end: Deputies said the victims were shot once in the head with short arrows

Just after 7am Tuesday, he apparently attacked his older son, 21-year-old Florida State University student Jose Maldonado, with the crossbow but the dart just grazed the son's ear.

Deputies say the father tried to choke the son, but the younger Maldonado managed to escape. He did not report the attack.

Authorities had responded to the Maldonado home Tuesday with a SWAT team after the man's long-time friend called 911 and said that Pedro Maldonado had confessed to him about the killings.

Gifted musician: Friends of 17-year-old Pedro Maldonado said he was passionate about music and excelled as a drummer

After finding the bodies of the mother and son, they learned through unspecified means that Maldonado was staying at a Cabot Lodge Motel near Lake City, east of Tallahassee and hundreds of miles north of the original crime scene.

Columbia County Sheriff's Office deputies found Maldonado dead about 2am. Wednesday. According to investigators, the man ended his life by slitting his throat and wrists with a knife.

Investigators had offered no information about a possible motive for the rampage, but the Sun-Sentinel reported that Maldonado was in debt and feared that he and his family might be deported back to their native Ecuador after their visas had expired. 

The father had several business ventures involving import and export and oil trading with South America, while his wife worked as an oil industry consultant in Miami.

Neighbors said the Maldonado family moved to Weston and settled in a $1,900-a-month, three-bedroom townhouse in the 4200 block of Vineyard Circle only a few months earlier and largely kept to themselves.

However, Marie Saboutin, who lives in the area, told Miami Herald Mr Maldonado appeared aloof and would avoid eye contact. Another resident described the father of two sitting in his garage with the door open and watching children at play. 

On Wednesday, Pedro Maldonado Jr's shocked classmates at Cypress Bay High School described the teen as bright and kind.

Memorial: Some 200 people gathered for an emotional candlelight vigil to celebrate the lives of Pedro Jr and his slain mother

According to his friends, the 17-year-old played drums in the school band and was taking advanced college-level courses, the station WSVN reported.

Some 200 members of the community came together for a candlelight vigil Wednesday night to remember the victims, NBC Miami reported. The memorial concluded with the release of two white balloons bearing the names of Pedro Jr and his mother.

Friend Santiago Estrada said Pedro, or Peter, as he was known in school, was passionate about his music and excelled at percussion.

Jose Maldonado, the sole survivor of the attack, reached out to the Ecuadorian consul this week to seek help in transporting his parents' and brother's bodies back home.
