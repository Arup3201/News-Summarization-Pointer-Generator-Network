It is has been a long journey back to credibility since former France manager Raymond Domenech sent Nicolas Anelka home in disgrace from the last World Cup and Patrice Evra led the team’s infamous mutiny in South Africa, 2010.

That episode prompted national outcry in France and an anguished debate over the identity of Les Blues, a team which had been powerful symbol of national unity in the Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps era but now had seemingly become a spoilt group of overpaid underachievers.

Even as recently as last November, when they lost the first leg of their World Cup play-off against Ukraine 2-0, it seemed unlikely that the French public would fall back in love with their players. But a stirring 3-0 win at the Stade de France and now a major tournament with star players performing, no splits in the camp and an attacking team winning games, seems to be doing the trick.

Captain Hugo Lloris senses that the Ukraine match was the turning point. ‘There have been some up and downs in the past few years, I admit,’ said the Tottenham goalkeeper.

‘But since the return leg against Ukraine in November we felt an enthusiasm behind the team. And in the friendly matches, we’ve noticed a rekindled love between the team and our fans.

‘There are very high expectations to please the supporters and up to now we’ve done what we needed to on the pitch to make them happy. But we want to go further and have all French people proud of the national team.’

On Monday in Brasilia they take on Nigeria team that has been the latest African squad to be beset by bonus rows – resolved only on Friday when the nation’s President Goodluck Jonathan intervened to ensure £2.25million of back payments arrived in Brazil. If France can get past Nigeria a potential quarter final with Germany looms.

Turning point: France's comeback play-off win against Ukraine got the nation back on side

It’s enough to bring back memories of the Deschamps team, the current manager having of course been captain in the final – because of Laurent Blanc’s suspension - when France won the World Cup in 1998.

‘They are a reference for all French players for future generations of footballers,’ said Lloris. ‘I grew up watching them on TV and they are an example to all of us on the pitch and especially as a collective unit.

'They achieved a lot. They did wonderful things in 1998 and 2006 and we try to be inspired by that.’

Disruptive influence? Manchester City playmaker Samir Nasri was omitted from the World Cup squad

Deschamps, who axed Samir Nasri from this squad, has himself has been part of the healing process. Evra, who led the munity of 2010 and was subsequently banned from the national team for five games, is now fully rehabilitated and now one of the manager’s key lieutenants in the group.

It was  Deschamps who signed Evra from Nice for Monaco when he 22 years old, a move that provided a springboard to his move to Manchester United. ‘We go a long way back,’ said Deschamps.

‘He was 22 years old when I met him when I was at Monaco. Patrice is very, very experienced player, it’s his ninth season with Man United, he’s won a lot of titles and been a captain there. He’s a winner and he’s accustomed to big matches and he’s prepared very well for to be ready for this World Cup.’

Deschamps is under pressure to replace the criticised Paul Pogba in midfield but Laurent Koscielny is expected to fill in for Mamadou Sakho in central defence due to Liverpool’s player’s calf injury.

But Deschamps has made light of the fact that both France and Nigeria were refused permission by FIFA to train at the £600 National Stadium in Brasilia because of fears about the playing surface.

‘FIFA wanted to protect the pitch for the upcoming matches after this one, ‘said Deschamps. ‘So we have to adapt and go to another stadium to train. We have to take everything with a smile.’
