Mickey Rourke's questionable boxer shorts pack a punch of their own.

The 62-year-old actor, who is returning to the boxing ring on Friday for his first match in 20 years, made for quite the dizzying sight as he stripped to a pair of garishly patterned Björn Borg underpants.

Mickey showed off his ripped physique at the official weigh-in ceremony on Thursday in Moscow, Russia, ahead of tomorrow's five-round match against fellow American, 29-year-old Elliot Seymour.

Opponent: He was at the ceremony with his rival, 29-year-old fellow American Elliot Seymour

Seymour was also at today's weigh-in - wearing a pair of baby blue boxer shorts, teamed with socks and sandals.

The pair will take to the ring ahead of a match between Russia's Ruslan Provodnikov and Jose Luis Castillo of Mexico.

Sovetsky Sport sports website reported earlier this week that the American actor was quoted as saying by promoters: 'Boxing is a serious part of my life. It taught me respect and determination, patience and concentration. I always dreamed of fighting a match in Russia.' 

Good sports! The pair will take to the ring on Friday ahead of a match between Russia's Ruslan Provodnikov and Jose Luis Castillo of Mexico.

Hats off: It will mark Mickey's first boxing match in 20 years after The Wrestler star formerly hung up his boxing gloves

On Wednesday Mickey was pictured training with boxing coach Marvin Somodio, who is legendary trainer Freddie Roach's assistant.

The Pope Of Greenwich Village actor displayed his sculpted physique inked over with various tattoos on his chest and arms as his new 'do was kept perfectly in place for the grueling training session.

Coach Somodio held up focus mitts as Rourke worked some combinations with a sweat jacket on and white boxing gloves.

Later he was seen doing some conditioning work as he held up a large weightlifter's plate to strengthen his core and deltoids.

The actor was an amateur boxer before his Hollywood career took off and he became a sex symbol star in films such as '9 1/2 Weeks.'

He returned to boxing as a professional for eight matches in the 1990s, causing damage to his face that necessitated surgery and changed his appearance.

In 2008 he starred in The Wrestler about a washed-up fighter making a comeback, winning a Golden Globe for best actor.

Rourke is a frequent visitor to Russia and has been romantically linked to a Russian-born model, Anastassija Makarenko.

'Mickey Rourke is in a perfect bodily condition and he has had spars with young boxers in Russia,' sports manager Maxim Kornilov told TASS, a Russian news agency. 

He represents the interests of the former world champion in welterweight, Ruslan Provodnikov.

'Given his age 62 years old - he is in a perfect shape,' Kornilov said. 'He continues training for the fight now.'

'Mickey did appear in spars with young boxers and we'll wait and see his performance on the prize-ring,' he said. 'I think he'll cope with the task because he has a wealth of experience. 

Back in the day: Rourke was a professional boxer before he took up a career in acting. He began at the age of 12 and made a brief comeback to the ring in 1991 before hanging up his boxing gloves in 1994
