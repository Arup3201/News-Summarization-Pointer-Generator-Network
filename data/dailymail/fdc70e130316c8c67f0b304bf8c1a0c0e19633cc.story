A principal has claimed radicalisation is not a problem at his Islamic school because he tells pupils that the Islamic State death cult is manufactured by Western countries.

Al-Taqwa College Principal Omar Hallak reportedly shows his almost 2,000 students ‘evidence’ that Islamic State terrorists are ‘not linked to Islam’.

‘We don’t believe Muslims are creating IS,’ Mr Hallak told The Age. He believes that the murder and brutality carried out by Islamic State terrorists is actually a plot by Western countries to control oil in the Middle East.

The school, which is based in Melbourne’s outer-west, Victoria, is focussed on educating Australian Muslims that ‘follow Australian Law’, he said.

‘In the mosque, we talk to them many times. We show them evidence it's not linked to Islam,’ Mr Hallak explained.

The principle’s belief that IS is simply a plot caused by Israel and America stems from his theory that the terrorists use ‘shiny new equipment’.

Al-Taqwa College is an independent primary and secondary school. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Hallak for comment.

A spokesman for the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia Keysar Trad told Fairfax Radio on Monday the principle was just trying to discourage young people from joining the terror group.

'I can understand anyone taking offence to being in any way implicated in the type of crimes that IS has been reported to have done,' Mr Trad said.

'But in the bigger picture scheme of things, the real issues are that we have to find as many ways as possible to convince young people to keep away from this group and have negative feelings towards this group.'

Instead of criticising the principal for blaming the West, Mr Trad said the principal should be told 'we appreciate what you're doing, but we don't need the "us and them" approach'.

Abdullah Elmir, a 17-year-old Australian who went missing from his home in Sydney’s west at the end of June 2014, is fighting with Islamic State terrorists 

Mr Trad said IS had done an 'unprecedented level of damage' to the image of Islam.

He said there was a minority view that it was 'a plot from forces outside of Islam', either the West or Syria's Asad regime. 

Mr Hallak's remarks come after more than 100 Australians are thought to have flown to Syria and Iraq to fight with the Islamic State terrorists so far.

Radicalised teens include Abdullah Elmir, a 17-year-old Australian who went missing from his home in Sydney’s west at the end of June 2014, and Melbourne school boy Jake Bilardi.

The 18-year-old died in a suicide mission in central Iraq last week after travelling to Iraq with a ‘death wish’ last year after dropping out of school. 

Schoolboy Jake Bilardi was killed in a suicide bomb in Iraq last week after becoming radicalised online in Melbourne 

On Sunday night his devastated father John Bilardi told 60 Minutes that it was clear his son suffered from psychological problems from an early age, but that they were never properly addressed, despite the fact all the warning signs were there.

'I would just like everyone to know that the buck stops here with me. He was my son. I knew there was something not right with his behaviour,' he said.

The teenager is believed to have converted to Islam in 2012 when he was in Year 10, shortly after his mother died of cancer.

'Just out of the blue he said, "I've gone Muslim",' his father said.

'To see him sitting there with that gun... I just couldn't believe that was my son,' Mr Bilardi said about the photograph of his son holding a rifle, flanked by other IS members, in front of the terrorist group’s black and white flag.

Suhan Rahman, from Melbourne, is said to have died last week while fighting for Islamic State

His wife posted a bloodied photo of her dead husband on Twitter. A rifle was placed on his body

The woman who claimed to be Rahman's wife said: 'I'm the most content I have ever been in my life.'

A researcher at the London based terrorist research centre ICSR posted this photo of Rahman on Twitter

'They put him in a car loaded with explosives. They probably just shouted 'praise Allah' or whatever, and sent him off. I can't imagine what he was feeling.'

Other young men who have travelled from Melbourne to join Islamic State include Suhan Rahman and jihadi Mahmoud Abdullatif – both of whom are also now dead.

A woman claiming to be Rahman’s wife posted a photo of his bloodied dead body on Twitter, announcing that he has been killed while fighting in Syria.

Rahman, who had been fighting under the name Abu Jihad al Australi, previously threatened a terrorist attack on Australia claiming he would 'bring the war home' to the west in January.

‘Spill blood young Aussies,’ he wrote on Twitter.

His last known location was Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in Syria.

The woman, named Zumarul Jannah, who claimed to be his wife said: ‘Alhamdulillahi rabbil alimeen, I'm the most content I have ever been in my life ♡.’

Australian-born jihadist Mahmoud Abdullatif, who was reported dead in January, was friends with Rahman

A Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5, which they said originated in France

Zehra Duman, pictured, left behind a distraught family when she fled for the Middle East late in 2014. She later posted that she had married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif

His death came after his friend Abdullatif, nicknamed the playboy jihadi, was killed in January.

Abdullatif’s wife Zehra Duma, also from Melbourne, similarly announced her husband’s death on social media.

She recently shared a series of propaganda pictures that she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen.

In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?'

Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.'

Her father, Duvat Duman, told the Herald Sun: 'She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago.'

Other Australian jihadis, who are wanted by the Australian Federal Police, are Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar.

Both men famously published photographs of themselves on Twitter showing them holding up decapitated heads.
