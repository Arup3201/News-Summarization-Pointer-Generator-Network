One young woman's first experience of a music festival ended in tears on Saturday when she left the event with blood-soaked clothes and four stitches in her head.

Sarah Watts Glidden was attending the Adelaide Stereosonic festival at the weekend, dancing in the crowd with her friends while listening to electronic artist Uberjakd play his set.

Out of nowhere, the 19-year-old was hit with a flying glass bottle leaving her with a nasty gash on her forehead from which she was quickly losing blood.

'I didn't see anything at all but just felt and heard the big smack on my head,' Ms Glidden told Daily Mail Australia.

Sarah Watts Glidden was at Stereosonic music festival in Adelaide on Saturday when she was hit by a glass bottle, presumably thrown into the crowd by another partygoer

The wound was 'gushing' and 'squirting' blood, and resulted in Ms Glidden being given four stitches in her head

'I can't recall what I was thinking but I put my hand on the wound and blood was gushing absolutely everywhere.'

Covered in her own blood the teenager said she was rushed out of the crowd by two of her friends - Ashley and Stacey - when the trio were fortunate enough to bump into first aid officers.

They took Ms Glidden to the medical tent but paramedics had trouble stopping the bleeding, estimating she had lost more than half a litre of blood due to the injury.

A medic put four stitches in her head on the spot, and the 19-year-old will likely be left with a permanent scar from the injury.

The teenager was attending the second day of the two-day festival, and had planned to take it easy as she was heading overseas the next morning

However she was left covered in her own blood and will likely have a permanent scar from the injury

The paramedic that treated the teenager said the injury caused arterial bleeding, while Ms Glidden's friend Ashley said 'at one point when I took my hand off (the wound) that it legitimately squirted'.

'Looking back on it it's terrifying. I was really just having a great time and out of no where it happened,' the Adelaide woman added.

'I guess because of the shock I didn't notice any pain to start off with, it was really the sound and the feeling that hit me.

'Seeing the blood down my arm and legs made me understand the seriousness off it. During the time I was pretty light headed and dizzy as well.'

The injury has ruined her family holiday to Bali, and means she wont be able to participate in any activities she was looking forward to 

Ms Glidden said Ashley saw the bottle that hit her - identifying it as a small container of Jack Daniel's whiskey.

Aside from ruining her first music festival experience, the injury has also put a dampener on the woman's overseas holiday.

Ms Glidden had decided not to drink and instead drove herself to the event as she was heading on holidays with her family the next morning. 

On Sunday morning she left for a trip to Bali with her family to celebrate her brother graduating high school, but she will no longer be able to take part in many activities she was looking forward to doing.

Mr Glidden (left) said she was simply enjoying herself with friends when the bottle 'came from nowhere'

'I can't really swim as I can't get any of their water on the laceration,' she revealed.

'I won't be able to wash my hair, we are going to Water Bom Park (a water amusement park) but I'll again have to watch or go in areas where I can't get wet.'

In a post to Facebook Ms Glidden urged others to think about their actions when taking glass into festivals - something that is banned at such events due to its potential to cause such harm.

'Please please please, think twice about what you smuggle. And if you're gonna do it - put the glass in a bin,' she wrote.

'If you're going to throw something then you're simply an idiot. Please consider the repercussions of your actions,' the post concluded.
