That's one way to cap off a successful first date.  

Tristan Gareau’s new relationship got off to a fiery start last week when he rescued a man from a burning car on his way back from a romantic rendezvous with his new flame. 

The 21-year-old resident of Winnipeg, Canada, was driving in the area of Grant Avenue and Kenaston Boulevard just before midnight last Tuesday when he spotted a car that had smashed into a condominium.

Gareau, who was driving a young woman home after their first date, pulled over and rushed to the smoldering car to see if he could be of assistance.

Inferno: Gareau was dropping off his date in Winnipeg, Canada, when he came upon a car that had slammed into the side of a condominium  

In the nick of time:  Gareau rushed to the driver's side, unbuckled the unconscious man and dragged him to safety, just seconds before the car burst into flames 

Adrenaline rush: Gareau is still not sure how he was able to pick up the victim, who was about 90lbs heavier than him 

The 21-year-old opened the front door on the driver’s side and was greeted with a puff of black smoke and a heatwave.

He noticed that the driver, a 65-year-old man, was unconscious but his foot was still on the accelerator, causing the wheels to continue spinning, reported GlobalNews.ca.

The 5-foot-10, 135lb Gareau then grabbed the elderly driver, who was at least 90lbs heavier, and dragged him about 5 feet away from the car, reported Metro News. 

Just seconds after pulling the 65-year-old motorist to safety, the vehicle burst into flames.

Two police officers who were on their way to a different car crash at the time came to Gareau’s aid and took over the rescue.

Emergency: The driver, Steve Guy. suffers from diabetes and had a strange reaction while driving his car through Winnipeg, which caused him to jump a curb and slam into the house

The crash and fire caused an estimated $95,000 in damage 

The victim was hospitalized but is expected to make a full recovery. According to police, the man suffered a medical emergency while driving, resulting in his car jumping a curb and smashing into the condo.

The collision and subsequent fire caused an estimated $95,000 in damage.

Meanwhile, Gareau said his heroics helped him score major points with his date, who has since become his girlfriend.

He added that while the young woman was scared in the moment, she handled the situation well.

The 21-year-old nightclub DJ noted that he does not consider himself a hero and is not interested in fame.

Reunion: Four days after the rescue, Steve Guy got to shake the hand of the man who saved his life  

New friends: The two men embraced and exchanged phone numbers at the very spot where the collision took place 

Guy, 65, marveled at the fact that he walked away from the fiery wreck with only minor bruises 

Last Friday, Gareau reunited with the man he helped rescue, 65-year-old Steve Guy, at the very spot where the unfortunate driver nearly lost his life.

Guy, who suffers from diabetes, said he did not remember how he drove into side of the building, nor how Gareau dragged him out of the car.

Standing in front of the soot-stained condo, Gareau and Guy shook hands and embraced, with the older man marveling that he escaped the fiery crash with only a few minor scratches to his back sustained during the rescue. 

'I can live with it,' Guy joked.
