David Gill, the Football Association vice-chairman, has ruled himself out of standing for the British FIFA vice-presidency following Michel Platini's decision not to run against Sepp Blatter.

Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive who is now a UEFA executive committee member, was the leading candidate for the post but it is understood he has told senior figures at the FA that it is 'very unlikely' that he will allow his name to be put forward.

Gill's move comes after UEFA president Platini's decision last week not to challenge Blatter for the FIFA presidency.

Dedicated: The former Manchester United chief executive still regularly attends their matches

It is understood that Gill, 57, has also told Platini of his intentions to remain at UEFA but not stand for FIFA as he does not want to work under Blatter. 

The incumbent president appears virtually assured of winning a fifth term in office with splits among UEFA counties meaning there is no likelihood of a credible challenger being put forward from the European confederation.

Gill's decision is a big blow to the FA as he was the outstanding English candidate for the position, which is to be voted on by UEFA associations in March and is expected to be contested by Scottish FA president Campbell Ogilvie and Welsh FA president Trefor Lloyd Hughes.

Gill would have been tempted if Platini was in office but is believed to feel that FIFA executive committee members wield too little decision-making power and often merely rubber-stamp Blatter's wishes.

Candidate: David Dein is very well-connected in international football circles and is thought to be a candidate

The FA will now be under pressure to come up with another candidate, but it would need to be someone with a significant presence.

One possibility would be Sir Trevor Brooking, who has retired from his job as the FA's director of football development. Brooking has profile as a former England player and experience of administration from his FA role and as a past chairman of Sport England.

An obvious choice would be former Arsenal and FA vice-chairman David Dein, who is well-connected in international football circles but the fact he does not have an official FA role currently prevents him from standing.

Stepping down: Jim Boyce, the current British FIFA vice-president (right), has insisted he will step down in May

Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce, the current British FIFA vice-president, is due to step down next May and insists he will not change his mind due to family reasons.

Boyce told Press Association Sport: 'I have made it abundantly clear, despite having been asked by many people to continue, that I will be stepping down.

'It is up to the British associations to make sure they send the best candidates they can for the election for this very important position.'

The vote is due to take place at UEFA's Congress in Vienna at the end of March.
