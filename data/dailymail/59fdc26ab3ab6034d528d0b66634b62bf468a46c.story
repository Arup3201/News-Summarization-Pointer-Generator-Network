The attorney for an 18-year-old man featured laughing and joking over the fate of the alleged Ohio rape victim in a leaked YouTube video described the teenager's behaviour as, 'disappointing, insensitive and unfortunate' on Monday night.

Speaking at a brief press conference Dennis McNamara sought to distance his client, Michael Nodianos, from the horrific events alleged to have taken place in Steubenville Ohio last August.

Mr McNamara said, 'After some sober reflection he is ashamed and embarrassed himself. He's sorry to victims and his family. He was not raised to act in this manner.'

It also emerged on Monday that Mr Nodianos has been forced to drop out of Ohio State University, where he was on athletic scholarship, after receiving numerous threats.

Laughing: A video from the night of the alleged attack shows Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student, laughing callously and referring to a girl getting raped while she was reportedly drunk 

Tension: Many in the community believe police have failed to fully investigate an allegation of rape. Two high school football players have been arrested following the alleged sex attack

Picking sides: Members of 'hacktivist' group Anonymous- seen wearing 
their trademark masks- have taken on the Steubenville case because they 
feel there is a police cover up protecting other people involved

Mr McNamara insisted that his client had not been in the house at the time of the alleged attack but had arrived as the girl was being taken out of the house.

He claimed that his client's personal and Ohio State University email accounts have been hacked since the video was leaked and that his parents have been forced to change their telephone numbers after receiving death threats.

'There were people trying to find his class schedule at OSU, trying to access him there,' McNamara said. 'Some have even been at the dormitory during the fall term looking for him.'

The Daily Beast reports that the freshman student was forced to drop out  because of the threats.

Nearly 1,000 people gathered in the 
small town of Steubenville, Ohio over the weekend to protest the 
handling of an alleged gang rape where a teenage girl claims she was 
sexually assaulted by two star football players.

The case has sparked fury both in the
 rural town and across the country as those involved have  effectively 
been accused by social media, even though police have only arrested two 
16-year-old boys who were pictured carrying the alleged victim's limp 
body on the night of the incident.

The
 backlash has echoes of the international outrage triggered by the death
 of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh Pandey, who died as a result of the massive 
injuries sustained during a brutal gang rape at the hands of six men in 
Delhi, India.

In Ohio, only two teens have been charged- Ma'lik Richmond and Trenton Mays - though many in the close-knit town believe that there is a cover up underway to keep more players from the beloved high school football team from being arrested.

Over the weekend, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said officially that no further suspects would be charged.

'There was more than two kids involved. The kids who have money in this town have not been arrested,' demonstrator Lisa Waxler said.

Beliefs like that have prompted defense attorneys to call for serious changes in the case before any trial takes place. Lawyer Walter Madison wants to move the trial to a different town because activists simply want to draw blood and have less concern for what is truly justified.

Anger: Up to 1,000 people protested at Jefferson County Courthouse in Steubenville, Ohio, today. They believe local police have failed to fully investigate a 16-year-old's rape allegations to protect the local football program

Standoff: Deputies stand guard shortly after the sheriff announced there would be no more arrests in the case

'What we have in this county is a legal lynching and I can't stand for that on my watch,' he told NBC.

The party where the alleged rape took place dates back to August of last year- just before the school year began at Steubenville High School- but the case did not garner much national attention until recently.

Horrible: This pictured, originally posted to Instagram, shows Ma'lik Richmond and Trent Mays carrying the seemingly lifeless body of the unidentified victim

A sect of the hacker group Anonymous took on the case and have scoured the internet for various photos and videos posted by students who were at one of the three parties that Richmond and Mays are said to have brought the allegedly unconscious victim, whose name has not been released due to her age and the sexual nature of the accusations.

One of the most jarring pictures is that of the two teens carrying the girl by her ankles and wrists, which was posted to the photo-sharing application Instagram by another party attendee.

The group, which arranged today's 'Occupy Steubenville' protest, also released a video that
 showed several other young men joking about an assault.

The sheriff, who said the protesters would not listen to his defense of the police, said there would be no 
charges linked to the video, as it added no new evidence of any 
crimes. 

'I'm not going to stand here 
and try to 
convince you that I'm not the bad guy,' he said to a chorus of boos, 
according to a Reuters report. 'You've already made your minds up.'

Abdalla, who said he first saw the video three days ago, later 
commented: 'It's a disgusting video. It's stupidity. But you can't 
arrest somebody for being stupid.'

Anonymous: The online activist group organized a protest in Steubenville yesterday. They accuse police of failing to thoroughly investigate an allegation of rape.

Accused: Two 16-year-old members of the Steubenville Big Red football team are charged with rape. Protesters in the city yesterday said the police hadn't fully investigated the allegations in order to protect the team

Jyoti Singh Pandey, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, died in a Singapore hospital 13 days after being attacked as she made her way home from the movie theater in New Delhi.

The brutal case has caused uproar in India, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for the suspects in the case to be hanged.

She and a male friend were attacked when they got in what they believed was a shared van.

The five adult suspects appeared in court as the trial is due to start, and the youngest man involved is only 17-year-old so he faces charges in youth court.

The leader of the protest in the close-knit city of Steubenville, just outside Pittsburgh, called on 
victims of sexual assault to step forward, with several 
people reacting, telling their stories to the crowd.

Abdalla responded that he had dedicated his 28-year career to investigating such crimes and had arrested more than 200 suspects.

Yesterday authorities launched a website they said would sought fact from fiction in the case.

It has the 
appearance of a legal briefing, with black type on a white background, 
providing an intentional departure from escalating emotions over the 
case and how it's been handled.

'This site is not designed to be a forum for how the Juvenile Court ought to rule in this matter,' the site declares.

The
 website provides a timeline of the case, summaries of Ohio laws that 
affect sex charges, online posts and reaction to them, facts about the 
local police force and a pledge of transparency.

Public
 interest in the case increased this week with circulation online of the 
unverified video, featuring Mr McNamara's client and more than 12 minutes long, that purportedly shows 
another young man joking about a sexual assault.

Ohio Attorney General Mike 
DeWine called the posting 'despicable' but agreed it didn't constitute
 new evidence for local investigators, who were aware of it before the 
posting.

The accused two students will be tried as juveniles on February 13.

The sheriff has also come under fire for
 leaving the case with local police and refusing to revisit the
 original investigation.

'People have got their minds made up,' he told the news agency. 'A case like this, who 
would want to cover any of it up?'.
