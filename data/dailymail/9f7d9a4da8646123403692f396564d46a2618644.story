High school security guard Richard Cowser, 54, collapsed and died which trying to break up a fight between two girls at a Chicago school

A security guard has died after trying to break up a fight between two girls at a high school on Thursday.

Richard Cowser, 54, who was affectionately known as 'the Hulk' to students, was restraining one of the teenagers when he slumped to the ground and 'turned blue', according to witnesses.

He collapsed against a locker in a hallway at Thornwood High School in South Holland, Chicago and seemed to be struggling to breathe.

Another school employee performed CPR but Mr Cowser was pronounced dead at Ingalls Memorial Hospital 30 minutes later. 

An autopsy is expected to be performed today.

The two teenage girls, aged 18 and 19, are being interviewed by police following the fight.

Police are awaiting the autopsy results to decide on whether to bring criminal charges.

Authorities are also examining surveillance footage from inside the school as part of the investigation.

Students, who nicknamed the security guard 'the Hulk' because he looked like the wrestler, expressed their shock at his sudden death.

Grief counselors have been brought to the high school for students. One teenager told CBS: 'Everyone loved him, he was the coolest.'

Mr Cowser had worked at the high school for a year. He was in good health and into body building, his sister told ABC7.

She said that her brother had recently moved to Chicago from Florida to help their elderly parents
