A wounded veteran who was injured in the deadly Texas train crash last week says the victims aboard a doomed tractor trailer rig had just a split-second before they were struck by a train.

Sergent First Class Richard Sanchez was at the front of the trailer with his wife when someone on board yelled 'Train!'

The wounded serviceman appeared on the Today show to speak about the horrific crash in Midland on Thursday night that killed four veterans and injured 16 others -- including at least one woman whose leg had to be amputated.

Sgt Sanchez said he had just enough time to push his wife off the trailer before the speeding engine smashed into the veterans.

'There's not really any delay in time, the first time I heard somebody yelling train, me pushing her and me getting thrown,' he recounted. 'It all seems to go by extremely fast,' he said.

Sanchez added the he was struck in the chest by the crossing arm as it lowered -- just moments before impact.

The National Transportation Safety Board found that the train crossing signals only began flashing 20 seconds before the train hit and that the train engineer hit the brakes only five seconds before impact -- not nearly enough time to stop.

The crossing arms at the intersection began to lower 13 seconds before the train crossed through the intersection.

As the arms began to come down, 12 seconds before impact, the truck drove across the tracks. The cab and the very front of the trailer crossed to safety, but the midsection was directly in the path of the speeding train, the NTSB found.

'I saw my husband laying in a ball, I thought he was dead. He wasn’t moving, didn’t look like he was breathing, there was blood everywhere,' Sgt Sanchez's wife Heather said.

He suffered a broken back and cannot walk until the swelling around his spine goes down, he told Today.

She lost her composure as she recalled the horror of the day.

Kansas-based lawyer David Pottroff, who specializes in train crashes, said the train warning system was designed to activate 30 seconds before the train crosses an intersection. The signals in place gave on 20 seconds warning.

However, the NTSB said they all functioned how they were supposed to.

On Saturday, 300 people attended a vigil on Saturday evening in downtown Midland.

The attendees lit white candles and prayed for the victims' families and the community as a whole. The town square was lined with American flags.

Ministers prayed for residents in the town to have strength in wake of the tragedy.

'I promise you the next few days will be tough but when we get to the other side, it will be better,' Mayor Wes Perry told the crowd.

'The community is grieving. We are grieving and in pain,' City Manager Courtney Sharp said.

Midland resident Gery Cain said he attended the vigil to 'participate in the healing that this will bring to the community.'

It was revealed on Saturday that the parade float had crossed onto the railroad tracks after warning signals were going off, investigators revealed on Saturday.

Four veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan were killed and 16 more people were injured when the train crashed into the flatbed truck in West Texas.

It was the second of two floats carrying veterans in Thursday's parade in Midland.

The first was exiting the tracks when the warning bells and signals were activated, 20 seconds before the accident, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

The second float did not enter the tracks until several seconds after the warning system went off, the NTSB said. By that time, the guardrail was lowering.

'Once the crossing becomes active, people should stop,' lead investigator Robert Accetta with the NTSB said at a news conference on Saturday afternoon.

The timeline was pieced together by combining information from a video camera mounted on the front of the train, another one on a sheriff's car and a data recorder that acts like an airplane's black box, activating when the train blared the horn, NTSB member Mark Rosekind said.

Nine seconds before the crash, the train sounded its horn, a blaring that lasted four seconds, according to Rosekind. The guardrail hit the truck, then the engineer pulled the emergency brake, trying to bring the train that was traveling at 62mph to screeching halt.

People on the first float and dozens of others who had come out to greet the veterans shrieked and watched in shock, as some aboard the truck tried to jump off, witnesses said. The veterans' military instincts kicked in as they treated the wounded.

The NTSB has also interviewed the engineer and conductor, and established the train's air brakes were working, Mr Rosekind said. No mechanical problems were found with the cars.

A review of the train's maintenance history found no defects, he added. The tracks also had no problems.

Investigators will try to establish on Monday what the engine could have seen as it approached the truck.

Part of the investigation includes whether the parade had the proper permit. The parade has been an annual event in Midland for nine years, but City Manager Courtney Sharp declined to say whether the group, Show of Support/Hunt for Heroes, had the necessary paperwork to hold the event.

Railroads are a vital part of Midland, a town that sits in the heart of Texas' oil rich Permian basin. Three or four tracks lie within city limits, and the site of the accident is just about 10 minutes from downtown.

'We take all steps into consideration when we permit,' Mr Sharp said. 'I hate to go down that track until all of the investigation is over, but yes we do take that stuff into account.'

The veterans were on their way to a banquet in their honour and were being cheered by a flag-waving crowd.

It was supposed to be the start of a three-day weekend of banquets, deer hunting and shopping in appreciation of the veterans' sacrifice.

Five people remained hospitalised early onSaturday. In Midland, three people were in stable condition and one in critical. None of the injuries are life-threatening, said hospital spokesman Marcy Madrid.

A fifth person who was transferred to a Lubbock hospital shortly after the accident is in serious condition.

Union Pacific spokesman Raquel Espinoza said the speed limit in that area was raised from 40mph to 60mph in 2006.
