Jones, who was sometimes listed as Dick Jones and Dickie Jones, appeared in a number of film and television productions up through 1965.

Jones said in Disney biography page that during Pinocchio's audio recording 'Mr. Disney would take an old storyboard drawing, pin it up on a four-by-eight celotex sheet, and start a dart game with me using pushpins.

'He was good at throwing pushpins, underhand, and making them stick with fantastic accuracy. He always won the game.'

Many of Jones' credits were Westerns. He appeared on The Lone Ranger television series, and played a sidekick to The Range Rider.

Jones was just ten years old when he voiced the role of Pinocchio

Jones also appeared in television episodes for both The Gene Autry Show and Annie Oakley.

Jones starred as Buffalo Bill Jr. in the 1955 series of the same name.

Jones left acting for real estate, the Times reported. His last film appearance was in the 1965 film Requiem for a Gunfighter.
