Battered: Ian McCann, 83, who was repeatedly hit with a hammer by the intruder who burst into his home in Northampton

An 83-year-old army veteran was repeatedly hit in the face with a hammer by a masked robber who broke into his home.

Ian McCann was also tied up with telephone cord by the intruder who threatened to murder his pet chihuahua dog Double if it did not stop barking.

The grandfather-of-two was preparing breakfast when the robber, wearing a balaclava, burst in through the back door of his home in Northampton.

When Mr McCann went to investigate he was confronted by the man who pushed him onto the sofa before ripping the telephone off the wall and using the cord to bind his hands together.

He then demanded money for drugs - and hit him over the head repeatedly with a hammer when he refused.

Mr McCann was struck dozens of times in the face during the attack on Sunday morning which lasted up to an hour. The robber stole £60 in cash from the pensioner's wallet, took his debit card and demanded the pin number.

He put two cushions over the old man's face and ran out of the terraced house through the back door.

Despite being battered Mr McCann, a divorcee who has two grown-up daughters, managed to get his hands free and knocked on his neighbour’s door.

The retired laboratory assistant, who is secretary of his local residents’ association, suffered severe bruising which covers half his face and neck.

Today he allowed pictures of his horrific injuries to be released in a bid to catch the vicious attacker.

The grandfather, who served in Hong Kong in 1949 and 1950 as part of his National Service, said: 'I heard a crash and went I went into the kitchen he was standing there.

'He wanted money for drugs but when I didn’t give it to him he grabbed me and dragged me into the living room and threw me onto the sofa.

'He kept shouting at me "give me the money, give me the money". I told him "no I will not". I was angry someone had broken into my home and I was prepared to put up a fight.

'Then he went really mad and ripped out the telephone so I couldn’t use it and tied my hands up behind my back.

'He wanted the pin number for the debit card and I gave him the wrong one, he kept hitting me over the head, he gave me a real shiner.

'He could have easily killed me with the hammer. I lost count of how many times he hit me. It was dozens.

'The whole thing lasted between 40 minutes to an hour.

'I was taken to Northampton General Hospital and had an X-ray to check for any broken bones but I didn’t have any.

'I am not going to let this get to me, he needs to be caught and put away for the maximum 14 years.

'The neighbours have been really shocked as this doesn’t happen around here.

'If this maniac is not caught soon he will do it again and the next time his victim might not be as lucky as me.'
