Team news

Crystal Palace

Leicester

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has no fresh injury concerns ahead of his side's Barclays Premier League trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday

Defender Matthew Upson remains the only absentee with an ongoing calf issue, although Pearson has confirmed Zoumana Bakayogo - not listed in the squad at the start of the season - is to undergo surgery on an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

On-loan Nick Powell is available after being ineligble in Leicester's 5-3 win vs parent club Manchester United

On-loan striker Nick Powell is available again after missing last week's 5-3 win over parent club Manchester United due to ineligibility.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Hammond, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood, Drinkwater, Cambiasso, Simpson, Lawrence, Powell.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

The last time this fixture was played in the English top-flight, Palace were being managed by Attilio Lombardo (April 1998).

Leicester’s Andy King scored in both league fixtures between these sides two seasons ago.

Three of Leonardo Ulloa's five Premier League goals this season have come within two minutes of the opposition scoring.

After conceding only one set-piece goal under Tony Pulis, Palace have already let in five this season (excl. penalties).

Attilio Lombardo was in charge of Crystal Palace the last time they faced Leicester in the top flight in 1998

Palace are in danger of going five Premier League home games without a win for the first time since returning to the top-flight.

Jamie Vardy has won two penalties this season (both versus Man Utd); more than the 19 other Premier League clubs this season.

The Foxes have a shot conversion rate of 43 per cent inside the penalty area this season, higher than any other side.

Leicester are the only Premier League side yet to hit the woodwork this season.

Neil Warnock is looking to go four Premier League games unbeaten for the first time since December 2006 when he was Sheffield United boss.

The Foxes have won none of their last 15 Premier League games in London (D3 L12).
