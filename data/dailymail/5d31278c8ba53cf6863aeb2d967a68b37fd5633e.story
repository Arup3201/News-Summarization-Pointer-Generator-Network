It must have been like watching a driving stunt from an action film – only in slow motion.

An elderly motorist managed to leap between the two sides of a lifting road bridge as it rose into the air – all at 20mph.

Her car carried on up the sudden incline until she  plunged 7ft off the end of the carriageway on to the other side.

It then overturned, trapping the shocked woman inside.

Amazingly, she suffered only minor injuries following the incident at the Twin Sails bridge in Poole, Dorset.

Witnesses said the unnamed 86-year-old seemed oblivious to the flashing red lights warning that the bridge was about to rise when she crashed through a safety barrier and continued up towards the growing gap.

Staff operating the bridge watched in horror on CCTV but were unable to return it to a horizontal position before her silver Renault Clio made the jump.

One witness said: ‘I thought it was a boy racer trying to jump across the bridge at first. It must have given the bridge operator one hell of a shock.’

Another eyewitness, Alex Evans, tweeted from the scene: ‘Woman carried on driving as bridge was lifting. Drove off edge and landed upside down.’

A spokesman for Dorset Police  said yesterday: ‘All the flashing lights were on and the barriers had come down.

‘Witnesses said she came right through the barrier at about 15 to 20mph as the bridge was opening.

‘They immediately stopped opening the bridge but she carried on driving up the ramp and that flipped her over on to her roof.’

He added: ‘Luckily she only sustained minor injuries.’

A Dorset Fire and Rescue Service spokesman described how the elderly woman was freed from the overturned car.

‘We secured the vehicle to stabilise it, to stop the casualty moving about,’ he said.

‘There was about seven foot between the car and the edge of the bridge.’

The driver was then taken by ambulance to Poole Hospital.

Poole Borough Council closed the bridge for almost four hours after the accident, which happened at 11.30am on Friday.

CCTV footage showed the lifting sequence operating normally, with the warning lights and barrier system all working.

The £37million bridge, which opened last year, sustained only superficial damage.

It has two distinctive 180ft long ‘arms’ that resemble sails when lifted, allowing boats in and out of Poole Harbour.
