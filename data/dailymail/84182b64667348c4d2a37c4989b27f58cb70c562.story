Efforts to restore the ancient Roman city of Pompeii are under a cloud after police launched an investigation into allegations of corruption at the historic site.

A €105million (£90million) project to save the buildings which were frozen in time after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD started yesterday.

But it has been overshadowed by the investigation into its boss and the arrests of two other officials involved with the restoration.

Claims: The ¿105million plan has been overshadowed by allegations of official corruption

Italy declared a state of emergency at the World Heritage Site in 2008, after archaeologists complained that the city had been neglected despite drawing 2.5million visitors every year.

Marcello Fiori was appointed to be special commissioner for the site, and oversaw the restoration of the city's main amphitheatre which was reopened in 2010.

Allegations have now been made that contractors on the theatre project were paid five times more than the market price for their work.

Luigi D'Amora, who was director of restoration at the time, has been arrested over the claims, while Mr Fiori is one of four other officials being investigated over the scandal. None of those involved have commented on the the investigation.

At work: EU officials vowed yesterday that the corruption claims would not slow the restoration

Caccavo, the restoration firm responsible for the work, has been banned from doing public sector work and has had more than €800,000 of assets seized by courts.

One of its officials, Annamaria Caccavo, is under house arrest while police investigate her for fraud, aiding abuse of office and corrupting a public official.

The corruption allegations have been linked to the influence of the local mafia, the Camorra, which is believed to be involved in many government and business projects in the area around Naples.

EU funds for the restoration project include 'a variety of measures to protect itself from the influence of organized crime - the Camorra - which infects many parts of the region', according to officials.

The latest stage of the project which began yesterday aims to restore two ancient homes, the House of the Dioscuri and the House of the Cryptoporticus.

Unique: Pompeii gives an amazing insight into everyday life in the first-century Roman Empire

'The arrest of a businesswoman involved in restoration has no connection to the new project,' European Commissioner Johannes Hahn told The Times.

'I’ve always said that we want to preserve the cultural tradition and not the criminal one.'

Pompeii is considered one of the world's most important historical sites due to the unique insight it gives into the Roman way of life.

The eruption of Vesuvius covered the town in volcanic ash and wiped out nearly all its inhabitants.

The unfortunate townspeople were frozen in the poses they were in at the time of the eruption, and Pompeii's homes were preserved perfectly.

Generations of archaeologists and visitors have been able to wander the streets, marvelling at Roman taverns, theatres and even graffiti painted on the walls.
