British holidaymakers are drinking about 50 alcoholic drinks during their stay on board a cruise ship.

Beer is the most popular drink, according to research, with an average 46,000 bottles or cans consumed over a two week break - or about three per person per day.

Those cruising the waters of the Mediterranean were found to be the biggest drinkers, and worked out the findings based on an average of 2,200 passengers per cruise ship.

Cocktails were the second most popular drink for cruisers, with the average passenger confessing to drinking at least one a day - or 16 over the two weeks - a total of 35,200 per ship.Â 

Passengers also confessed to glugging half bottle of wine a day - meaning around 15,400 bottles of vino are consumed in two weeks.

And barmen poured some 828 bottles of whisky as passengers gulped down 16 shots each on average in two weeks, Bonvoyage's research found.

Steph Curtin, cruise development manager at the cruise travel agency, said: 'A cruise is one of the most relaxing holidays out there and it is evident from our research that passengers are certainly relaxing with a few alcoholic beverages!

'The majority of cruises have several different bars offering a variety of alcoholic services and it is great to see passengers taking advantage of this.'

Champagne was the least popular drink, with 734 bottles consumed - or just two glasses per person over the average two-week trip.
