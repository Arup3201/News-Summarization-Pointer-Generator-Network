Rail fares are on course to soar by a quarter over the next four years unless funding rules are torn up, Labour will warn today.

Official figures released this morning are expected to show that rail fares will rise by up to 5.6 per cent next year.

The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) said this would take the total increase to 24.7 per cent since the last election.

Rail fares are on course to soar by a quarter over the next four years and by up to 5.6 per cent next year alone

And Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh will warn that fares will rise by a further 24 per cent by 2018 unless existing rules are changed.

Although annual rail fare increases are implemented in January they are based on Retail Price Index figures from the previous July.

Under current rules, regulated train fares will rise by RPI plus 1 per cent.

But rail firms are also allowed to ‘flex’ fares on some routes by an additional two per cent.

Miss Creagh called for reform of the ‘broken market’, including capping fare rises on every route and simplifying fare structures.

In a speech in London today she will say: ‘Our rail fares are among the highest in Europe. Rail passengers rightly feel ripped off when they are uncertain if they paid the lowest fare.

‘Labour will create a legal right to the cheapest ticket for your journey, ending the confusion passengers experience. We will introduce a strict cap on rail fares, removing the “flex” arrangement that allows train companies to raise fares more on some routes.’

In his 2013 Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) announced that he was limiting the January 2014 regulated-fare rise to RPI

But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin accused her of hypocrisy, pointing out that Labour presided over years of inflation-busting fare rises.

He warned that her plan to abolish the ‘flex’ provisions would cost the taxpayer more than £130million over the next Parliament.

Mr McLoughlin said: ‘We fully recognise there’s more to do to bring down the cost of rail travel in Britain. But we need to do it responsibly and we can’t spend money we don’t have.

‘This Government is working hard to turn things around and help families with the cost of travel. 

'This year we were able to cap fare rises at the rate of inflation – only possible because we’ve cut inefficient spending elsewhere.’

In his 2013 Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne announced that he was limiting the January 2014 regulated-fare rise to RPI while reducing the ‘flex’ rule from 5 per cent to 2 per cent. This kept the average increase in regulated fares to 3.1 per cent this year.

Mr Osborne will now face pressure to make a similar announcement in his 2014 Autumn Statement.

The CBT said that while fares had gone up by more than 24 per cent since 2010, wages had only risen 6.9 per cent in that period.

CBT campaigner Martin Abrams said: ‘With people’s wages stagnating and in some cases falling, the expense of taking the train to work has become a huge part of living costs.’

He added: ‘If the Government doesn’t put an end to above- inflation fare increases quickly, ordinary commuters will be priced off the train and could be forced into agonising decisions such as moving house or quitting their jobs.’
