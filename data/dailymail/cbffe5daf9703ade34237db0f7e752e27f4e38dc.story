Steve Bruce said Hull City would be pleased to make Europa league group stage, as Hull City pepare to make their first appearance in European football.

The Tigers face Slovakian side AS Trencin in the Europa League third-qualifying round first leg on Thursday and Hull boss Steve Bruce admitted the prospect of maiking the group stages is a huge incentive

He told the Hull Daily Mail: 'Our goal is to get into the group stage, where we could face some of the big names of European football.

progression: Steve Bruce has taken Hull City from the Championship to the Premier League and now Europe

'That is the carrot for us, in terms of why we need to make sure we get through both qualifying rounds if at all possible. That is what I will tell the players.

'This tie is a step into the unknown in a lot of ways, we will just have to wait and see.

'That, to me, is the beauty of Europe anyway. It isn't all about Spain, Italy or Germany. The smaller nations can be just as tough to face.

'I am expecting a typical European game and we will have to be ready for the challenge.'

Trencin are a small club who have only been in the top flight of Slovakian football for three seasons - and who normally play in a stadium with a capacity of just 4,500 - but they have benefited from their links to Ajax.
