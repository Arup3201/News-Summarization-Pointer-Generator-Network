You won’t know his name, but Brian Sollitt was the genius who brought a perfect ending to countless dinner parties and family  gatherings at Christmas.

For more than half a century, the chocolatier and confectionery wizard beavered away in the kitchen of the Rowntree’s factory working on recipes and ideas for tantilising new treats.

But his greatest achievement was the iconic After Eight mint – a middle-class essential of the 1960s but still popular in households across the land.

Brian Sollit referred to After Eight mints as the highlight of his career. Here he presents a giant version to parliament to mark the 50th anniversary in December 2012

He was the head of the 'cream' department in 1962 when he was tasked with coming up with a new luxurious peppermint chocolate. The result was groundbreaking

Remarkably, this one man, who has died
 aged 74, was also involved in bringing Yorkies, Matchmakers, Drifters 
and Lion Bars to our sweetshop shelves.

The
 real-life Willy Wonka began his career  at the age of 15 when he was 
recruited to the cream department with responsibility for hand piping 
Black Magic chocolates.

He was swiftly transferred to the Creme Experimentation Department to become a confectioner and an artisan of his trade.

By
 1962, Mr Sollitt was head of the section tasked with coming up with a 
new luxurious chocolate that was to be wrapped around a peppermint 
fondant.

Under a veil of secrecy, he was taken to one side by a senior executive and asked to create the wafer-thin mint.

To
 this day, the process he developed of preventing the liquid fondant 
from oozing out of the chocolate casing is still an industry secret. His
 creation has sold by the billions ever since and the Queen Mother was a
 big fan of the mints.

All 
Mr Sollitt’s ideas and creations were taste-tested and refined before 
going into mass production in the factory and despatched to corner shops
 and newsagents in every town in the country.

One of many creations: Mr Sollit created the super-chewy Lion bar, originally known as Big Cat

The Yorkie bar got its name from the city of York, where Rowntree's main factory is. Brian Sollit worked there for 53 years until his retirement six years ago

The wafer-thin chocolates wrapped around a peppermint fondant that took the market by storm

During
 his 53 years at the factory Mr Sollitt was known for leaving seasonal 
treats like chocolate Santas on a tray outside his office for workers to
 take home.

Born in 1938, his childhood was deprived of most chocolate and sugary sweets due to war-time rationing.

But he joined the Quaker family company after leaving school and worked with chocolate all his life.

Mr
 Sollitt carried on collecting anything, from packaging to posters, that
 was to do with his favourite After Eight sweet. And last year he came 
out of retirement to make a giant three kilo version of the mint 
chocolate to mark its 50th anniversary.

Real-life Willy Wonka: Brian Sollit was compared to Roald Dahl's character Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Gene Wilder famously portrayed the character in a 1971 film

Alex
 Hutchinson, the historian for Nestle which now owns Rowntree’s, said: 
‘Brian’s impact on the British confectionery industry is incalculable.

‘It
 is easy to forget that the sweets we pick up in the shops today are 
things that would have been handmade lovingly in the early stages of 
development by Brian.

‘He 
spent months, or sometimes years, agonising over the technical details 
of his creations. He was an incredible man. He was asked to come up with
 this new chocolate and he did.’

Mr
 Sollitt also devoted much effort to raise money for charity. The 
skilled chocolatier made  giant Easter Eggs and once made a 3ft 
chocolate Pudsey Bear for  Children In Need.

He
 was also a brilliant teacher and trained many confectioners in their 
craft. Most of all he was a very likeable ‘larger than life’ figure.

‘Everybody said you would hear him laughing and singing before you saw him,’ said Miss Hutchinson.

Confectioner colleague Kath Musgrove added: ‘Watching Brian at work was like watching a true craftsman at his trade.

‘He spent hours at a marble slab expertly hand-covering chocolates each with their own individual markings on.

‘He was an ideas man and Brian bombarded the marketing team with his thoughts on what they should sell next.

‘He was instrumental over the years in assisting with the launch of many new products.’

Millions of After Eights are now made each year in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and sent to more than 50 countries.

In keeping with his colourful character Mr Sollitt decorated his house with 500 Santas each year.

He
 said: ‘I still believe in Father Christmas. When I was young, my dad 
used to make toys, so I loved Christmas time. Every surface in my house 
is covered with Father Christmases, snowmen and lights.

 ‘I get them from all over the place. I couldn’t live with anybody, there’s no room.’

He also opened his house up for a £1 fee to raise money for charity.

Mr Sollitt never married or had children. Friends said he was married to his job.

After Eight mints were the higlight of Mr Sollit's career. They sky-rocketed in the market for posh after-dinner snacks and still pervade restaurant tables today. The Queen Mother was famously a fan of the iconic treats
