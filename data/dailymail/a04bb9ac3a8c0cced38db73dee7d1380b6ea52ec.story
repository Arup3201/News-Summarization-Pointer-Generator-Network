A Colorado father posted a picture of him with his toddler on Facebook along with a chilling message, before shooting the little girl in the head and turning the gun on himself.

Merrick McKoy had broken into his ex-girlfriend's Westminster apartment on Monday morning and, after she fled to raise the alarm, he killed their 19-month-old daughter Mia.

Mia's mother, Kim Phanthavongsa, had a restraining order against McKoy who was described as being abusive and jealous.

She told police that she woke on Monday to find the 22-year-old standing over her with a gun. After a fight she managed to run to a neighbor's to call police.

After she left the apartment, McKoy posted pictures of himself with Mia, who had just learned to walk, and a series of chilling messages, according to the Daily News.

In one post he said: 'I told u I can’t live without u lol u thought I was joking now me n Mia out this b****.'

The last post on his Facebook page, under the name Type R Merrick (f** Kim), read: 'Don’t judge me had no choice.'

In a frantic 911 call, police were told McKoy was in the apartment with Mia and a gun. As police rushed to the apartment McKoy shot Mia in the head and turned the gun on himself.

The family of Miss Phanthavongsa, a nursing assistant student, described him as possessive and jealous.

'He was the type to say, if you’re not 
with me, you can’t be with anybody else,' Smaly Chham, told 9 News.

A neighbor added: 'He would just say that he wanted to be with her and if he can't be with her, nobody can be with her.'

Mia was remembered by her aunt, Vannatda Sivixai as a happy child who was just beginning to walk.

'What an angel. Whenever she smiled it was bright,' Miss Sivixai said.
