Forza has long been the jewel in Microsoft's crown - a racing series renowned for its poise and technical grace.

But from the moment you’re plunged into the seat of a Dodge Viper racing to a techno-filled race festival, it’s clear that Forza has had a complete engine overhaul.

What's immediately apparent is Forza Horizon’s vast open world. This forms the backdrop of a narrative - which, although predictable, is a welcome addition to the series.

Stunning: The game boasts a smooth frame-rate backed up with beautiful looks

It gives an RPG feel to proceedings with a focus on attaining XP. This can be achieved in a number of ways, from racing and showcase events, to the more bizarre knocking down road signs and getting clocked on speed cameras. 

The points you earn can then be spent on buying new cars, upgrading your existing vehicle and unlocking new events.

There are also lots of hidden cars, often degrading in some barren part of the map.

Once found, you can get them fixed - and with classics such as the BMW M1 or Aston Martin DB5 available, there's plenty of incentive to find them.

Although racing in Horizon is sharp and responsive, it hasn't evolved as much as expected.

It is still relatively linear (bar changes in track surface) but feels more arcade-like than its previous incarnates.

There’s even a popularity mechanic that keeps a tally on how you are driving. Burnouts, drifts, slipstreaming and other flashy moves earn you points.

You start as the lowest ranked racer, No 250, but as you move up the ladder, extra events and perks are unlocked.

Head to head: Races can be tough at first but AI is easily tweaked

Some events require different cars to enter, and there's the ability to change AI difficulty and driving assists before each one.

The showcase events, however, are wonderfully inventive. These see you racing planes, hot air balloons and performing tricks to win popularity.

Online, the showcase events are event better, with a car version of hide and seek a particular highlight. 

To stave off monotony, there are lots of different outposts to discover which can teleport you around the game world. Also, any other racers that you encounter during your travels can be challenged.

This brings about a mini game where you race to a point on your GPS as fast as possible.

Graphically, the game is wonderful. There’s a well-constructed day and night cycle which really impacts the races, while draw distance is impressive-enough to not ruin any of the sweeping vistas. 

Although a barren land, Horizon does offer small settlements dotted around the map.

It’s these that are the game’s graphical weakness, coming across as bland, lifeless and lacking any real detail.

Dangerous driver: You'll be awarded popularity points for driving recklessly

However, you’ll often be driving through them so fast that it doesn't really take away from the experience.

But this is one of the finest racing games ever made – providing a much-needed spark to a lagging series and making the most out of its open-nature premise.
