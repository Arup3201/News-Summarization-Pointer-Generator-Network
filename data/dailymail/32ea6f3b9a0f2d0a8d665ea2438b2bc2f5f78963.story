A prankster is terrifying urban explorers by hiding in an abandoned hospital and creeping up on them.

Photographers visiting the dilapidated St Mary's Hospital near Kirkcaldy, Fife, are confronted by Owlman, who stalks the corridors waiting for unsuspecting visitors.

The haunting creature is the 
creation of filmmaker Lawrie Brewster, who set up seven hidden cameras inside the Victorian building to film the photographers' reactions.

It captured one man was left cowering in the corner of the room after he tried to close the door on the monster.

Mr Brewster, 33, from Fife, developed a love of the horrific when he was a child and has had his films screened at
 the Sundance Film Festival and South by Southwest (SXSW).

He said: 'As a child I loved eerie dramas of the supernatural and classic spine-tingling classics, such as Hammer Horror films like The Devil Rides Out and The Wicker Man.

'The idea to create the Owlman was inspired by a terrifying god in the archives of ancient religion, related to the god Moloch.'

Mr Brewster decided to use the Owlman creation as part of a prank which took place inside the abandoned St Mary’s Children’s Hospital.

The horrifying Owlman’s head is made of a mixture of papier-mache, wire, and plenty of feathers.

He says, 'The St Mary’s Children’s Hospital prank was carefully set up over a period of several weeks, where we assessed how often visitors went to the hospital and what times they were most likely to appear.

'Once we were confident that our unfortunate victims were most likely to appear during a certain day and time, we lay in wait.

'We pranked about six people during the day, and the first three reactions were the most dramatic to share.

'Reactions were consistent with fight or flight, people either slamming doors shut, barricading and screaming at the Owlman to leave or escaping out of the hospital at top speed.

'The first reaction is the epitome of all things Scottish and that’s what makes him marvellous.

'The fact that we have an angry bald man shouting furiously is fantastic.

'The second reaction was the most primal and emotional and perhaps expresses the true terror we all hold in the face of the uncanny.

'We had to stop the prank and escort the man from the ruined hospital and share with him some sandwiches and a flask of tea.'

St Mary’s Children’s Hospital was a Victorian complex used to treat infectious diseases, and at one time focused its work on scarlet fever.

'This is just the beginning of the Owlman’s terrifying career, and we will see him in a mixture of public interactions and elaborate set ups,' he added.

'I treat these pranks as a work of public theatre - albeit without the public’s forewarning!'
