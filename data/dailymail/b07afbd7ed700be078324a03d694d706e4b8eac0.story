Father-of-three Victor Hayles was found hanging from the conservatory door by his wife Susan

A practical joker accidentally hanged himself on a conservatory door when he tried to play a prank on his wife.

Father-of-three Victor Hayles' last joke went 'horribly wrong' when he was found dead by his wife Susan in August.

After arriving home from a party shortly after midnight on the night he died, Mr Hayles took his dog for a walk.

When his wife went looking for him she made the grim discovery, finding her husband's body hanging from the conservatory door, his feet still touching the ground.

Portsmouth coroner David Horsley examining the circumstances of Mr Hayles' death, today recorded a verdict of accidental death and said the 57-year-old had been playing out a bizarre prank.

He said: 'I think it’s a prank that went horribly wrong and therefore I have to conclude it’s an accidental death.'

Mrs Hayles, who was married to her electrician husband for 18 years, said: 'We were relieved when the coroner ruled Victor’s death was an accident.

'We always knew he wouldn’t have committed suicide because he wasn’t very good at tolerating pain.

'It was just a practical joke that went horribly wrong.

'He was always pulling pranks and would pretend to electrocute himself when using the drill so I think this was just another of them.

'Victor knew I would
go and check on him and turn off the lights so I think he was waiting, 
ready to scare me with his joke.

'Although we are glad he hadn’t meant to kill himself, it’s still sad because we have lost him.'

A coroner ruled Mr Hayles' death was accidental, after his practical joke had gone 'horribly wrong'. His daughter, Daisy, said: 'Everyone loved him and he had lots of friends through his passion for motorbikes'

The inquest, held at Portsmouth Guildhall, heard Mr Hayles, who lived in the city, had been out drinking on the night of his death.

However, the level of alcohol in his system was only 1.7 times the legal driving limit.

The father-of three had made plans for the weekend of his death and was looking forward to his birthday and wedding anniversary, which were less than a week away.

His daughter, Daisy, 31, said: 'He lived his life like a bachelor and he loved it.

'He would go on holiday with his friends and go out drinking but was always eager to return home to his wife.

'Everyone loved him and he had lots of friends through his passion for motorbikes.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
