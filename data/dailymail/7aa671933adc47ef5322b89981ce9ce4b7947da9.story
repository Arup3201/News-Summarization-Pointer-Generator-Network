A South Park commercial that aired on Sunday during the Washington-Philadelphia Eagles game shines a humorous new light on the controversial team name the Washington Redskins.

The commercial which aired only in Washington D.C. seems to be an attempt by the creators of South Park to share their negative opinion of the team's refusal to change their name now that as of June, the name Redskins is no longer a protected trademark, reports The Huffington Post.

In the commercial, Eric Cartman runs a business under the Washington Redskins name.

Devil's advocate: Eric Cartman of South Park has taken over the Washington Redskins' name to the cartoon version of team owner Dan Snyder's chagrin 

Doesn't feel respected: In the cartoon commercial aired only to Washington D.C. during the Washington-Philadelphia Eagles game, Dan Snyder tells Cartman to stop using their team name 

The cartoon version of the Redskins owner Dan Snyder tells Cartman to stop using the name 'in the name of decency.'

A federal trademark board ruled in June that the Washington Redskins nickname is 'disparaging of Native Americans' and that the team's trademark protections should be canceled, a decision that applies new financial and political pressure on the team to change its name.

The Redskins quickly announced that they would appeal and fight to keep their name.

In the South Park episode Snyder calls Cartman's use of their teams name 'derogatory.'

'I have total respect for you,' Cartman insists, playing Devil's advocate.

'When I named my company Washington Redskins it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people.'

'I don't feel very respected,' retorts a cartoon version of a Redskins player.

The chorus of critics against the use of the name has grown over the past year.

In June, a major sector of the United Church of Christ voted to urge its 40,000 members to boycott the Redskins. Half of the U.S. Senate recently wrote letters to the NFL urging a change, one of the letters stating that 'racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports.' D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray suggested Wednesday the name will almost certainly have to change if the team ever wants to build a new stadium in the city.

Snyder, who has vowed repeatedly never to change the name. Redskins players have mostly avoided the topic, aware of a potential conflict because they are employed by the team.

'Daniel Snyder may be the last person in the world to realize this,' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor, 'but it is just a matter of time until he is forced to do the right thing.'

The commercial got mixed reviews in Washington with Twitter users like Tyler Windover calling it, 'trash.'

 Other Twitter users like Sean Bishop liked it and said, ' LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO well-played.'

Won't budge: Despite a federal trademark board finding the name the Washington Redskins 'disparaging of Native Americans,' Dan Snyder (pictured) says he won't change it
