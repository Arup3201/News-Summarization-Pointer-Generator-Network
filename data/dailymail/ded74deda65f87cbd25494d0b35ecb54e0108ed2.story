They say a woman can never have too many pairs of shoes.

The Queen of Malaysia certainly agrees, if her gifts to the Duchess of Cambridge are anything to go by.

When Kate visited last year, Her Majesty Raja Permaisuri Agong packed her off with no fewer than six designer pairs, as well as two clutch bags and a stunning traditional dress.

Details of the extravagant presents lavished on Prince William and his wife during their Diamond Jubilee tour to South-East Asia and the South Pacific last September  – as well as those given to Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry on their trips abroad – were revealed yesterday by Clarence House and St James’s Palace (See below for full gift breakdown).

The value of the presents is never specified – perhaps to avoid embarrassing the buyer – and some are described vaguely as jewellery or ‘ornaments’.

Some will have cost little but may hold huge sentimental value, such as the ‘his and hers’ cardigans given to Charles and Camilla by the King and Queen of Norway.

Harry is now the proud owner of his a personalised ‘HARRY’ car numberplate thanks to a well-wisher in Brazil, as well as a bottle of the country’s potent local brew known as Cachaca, or burning water, which is made from 80 per cent proof fermented sugarcane juice.

His sister-in-law Kate returned from Singapore, Malaysia and the South Pacific with six new pairs of shoes, eight handbags, six scarves, shawls and sarongs and several more dresses and blouses.

One – a pink batik dress worn in the Solomon Islands – provoked controversy after it emerged that it had actually been made by a designer in the Cook Islands.

Her husband’s presents included a golden Kris – an ornamental dagger – from His Majesty The Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia.

In all, the couple brought home more than 200 presents, while the list of gifts given to globe-trotting Charles and Camilla runs to 18 pages.

In Denmark, the Prince of Wales was given an environmentally friendly ‘bio fireplace’, as well as an armchair.

His wife was particularly thrilled when, on a visit to the set of the country’s critically acclaimed crime drama The Killing, she was given a Faroese jumper by the show’s lead, Sofie Grabol.

On a trip to Canada in May, the couple received e-readers, handbags and model canoes. They also received two dog bandanas for their pet Jack Russells, dozens of books and CDs and a pair of baseball caps. The couple also received dozens of other presents – including cuff-links, brooches and bags – from officials they met in Australia. They received nothing from the Commonwealth country’s republican prime minister Julia Gillard.

They did, however, return home with two jars of Tasmanian honey, a merino wool sweater, a decorated emu egg and an opal cabochon – a highly-polished and shaped gem.

On the November visit they were also given – rather presciently – a pair of baby booties for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The couple announced they were expecting their first child in December.

Prince Harry’s first formal solo tour to  Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas saw him return home with several armfuls of goodies including a Mayan calendar, shell cuff-links, a polo stick and plenty more sports gear – including trainers and a specially designed T-shirt from the world’s fastest man, Usain Bolt.

Fittingly, the prince – well-known for his love of a good night out – also received two bottles of rum, as well as six Brazilian rugby shirts, a friendship bracelet and a block of amethyst quartz.

The giving and receiving of gifts is considered to be an important part of the Royal Family’s work in developing good relations with other countries – although courtiers are supposed to discourage the offering of presents of high monetary value.

Any jewels received by members of the Royal Family are not, officially, considered to be their personal property, because otherwise they would be taxable.

They are allowed to wear them during their lifetime, after which they are passed on to the monarch.

He or she then decides whether they should be handed over to the Royal Collection, or loaned out.
