Outspoken former Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom has quit the party – claiming it is now too politically correct.

Mr Bloom, a former flat mate of Nigel Farage, said he was leaving with a ‘heavy heart’ but had ‘had enough’ after being banned from speaking because of his controversial views.

He left with a warning for Ukip’s first elected MP Douglas Carswell that he could be knifed in the back by his new party if he was not careful.

Mr Bloom, who represented Yorkshire and the Humber for Ukip in the European Parliament for 10 years, added: ‘Douglas, watch your back.’

Former Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom said Ukip was no longer the libertarian force it once was - and was now just like every other political correct party

Mr Bloom, speaking to broadcaster Iain Dale on LBC, added: ‘Douglas, stick to your sort. You believe in libertarianism – don’t be pushed off.

‘Bear in mind we started in 2009 in Europe with 13 MEPs and we ended up with five, so there are dead UKIP bodies all over the place with knives quivering in their back so make sure it’s not yours.’

The former MEP, who was first elected to Brussels in 2004, said: ‘I was a founding member of Ukip and I’ve been a significant donor.

‘But now I find that instead of being the libertarian party, the party of common sense, I’ve been banned from speaking.

‘So, yes, it’s a very sad day for me. But the party seems to have gone astray.’

He added: ‘Quite what’s going on I couldn’t say, but I’ve had enough.

‘What kind of party are we supposed to be? The while point and the reason we are doing so well is because we were supposed to something different.

‘We seem to be drifting towards the politically correct mainstream like everybody else.

‘I’ve had enough of party politics. I don’t think party politics is for people who tell it like it is.’

Mr Bloom sparked controversy in 2012 after complaining that foreign aid is sent to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’.

It came after he sparked accusations of sexism after saying: ‘I just don’t think they clean behind the fridge enough’ - a notorious comment that indirectly led to his downfall

When female Ukip activists declared they were too busy to ‘clean behind the fridge’ Mr Bloom told a fringe meeting at the party’s 2012 conference: ‘The room is full of sluts!’

Douglas Carswell was today sworn in as Ukip's first elected MP after holding his seat of Clacton last week

Ukip leader Nigel Farage (centre) and newly elected Ukip MP Douglas Carswell (right) were joined by their party's candidate Mark Reckless on Rochester High Street, Kent, last week

The remark was meant as a joke but provoked a media storm, particularly as Mr Bloom then hit Mr Crick over the head with a Ukip conference programme outside the fringe event in a row about racism.

Furious party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bloom’s antics had ‘destroyed’ coverage of the party’s annual conference, and he was suspended from the party just two hours after giving his keynote address as Ukip’s defence spokesman.

In the past Ukip has delighted in being politically incorrect. But the leadership is trying to adopt a more serious image in the run-up to next year’s general elections.
