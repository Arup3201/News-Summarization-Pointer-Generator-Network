If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. That’s Team 17’s philosophy when it comes to Worms. And while gameplay has remained largely unchanged over the past decade, tweaks here and there have stopped the games from feeling stale.

Worms 3 bucks the trend somewhat, having been designed and developed exclusively for mobile platforms.

Bag of new tricks: Don't expect anything drastic to change with the gameplay but there are new weapons

As well as the traditional pass and play multiplayer, you can play online in ranked and friendly matches – while you can compete in single-player Bodycount mode to try and better your friends’ scores.

There are 27 single-player missions across four themes: Beach, Spooky, Farmyard and Sewer while an improved in-game menu system keeps you up-to-date with Worms news from around the world.

Battle mechanics have improved, too. There’s an all-new in-game class system where you can choose between Heavy, Scientist, Scout and classic Soldier, while new weapons include Nora’s Virus, the Blackhole Grenade and Canned Heat.

For those who miss playing on a big screen, the air play feature lets you link up to Apple TV and play on one device with up to four players.

The active player can plot their move secretly on the iOS device while the waiting gamers can witness the move on the TV screen.

 Worms 3 will be available for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch via the App Store on the 8th August.

Good fun: Worms is proof that there's still a very large market for games that just keep things simple
