Facebook has introduced new filters so that users can cut annoying posts from their News Feeds - offering much-needed relief from baby pictures and selfies. 

On Friday the company said updated Settings controls will show the people, pages and groups you follow that posted the most in the past week, along with a summary.

Facebook users will then be offered the option of seeing fewer posts from particular people - without having to conspicuously 'unfollow' or 'unfriend' them.

New measures: Facebook has announced it is to introduce new filters so that users can cut annoying posts from their News Feeds

The news will come as relief to many people - sick and tired of the same overzealous posters clogging up their News Feed with drivel. 

Users will also be able to see a list of others they have 'unfollowed' - meaning you can quickly add persistent posters you have cut from your News Feed in a moment of anger, CNN reports.

The company are being commended for giving more power to its users - following past criticisms that it has too much control over what people view.

Instead of a straight chronological list of posts from friends and family, the company uses algorithms to show an edited feed - with posts that are deemed more important being bumped to the top of the page.

It also looks at your behavior and what posts and pages you follow to decide what content to show you - with day-old stories occasionally being resurfaced.

Since it was founded in February 2004, Facebook has become a global phenomenon with an average of 864 million people now checking their News Feed every day.

In 2012, the company was accused of unethically experimenting on almost 690,000 users' News Feeds after it tinkered with the content of feeds, showing some people more positive content and others more negative posts.

The study was designed to find out how such posts affected the emotions and Facebook activity of those users.

In the past, users have been frustrated by the company's controlling approach to the News Feed and the difficulty in customizing what you see.T

here are options for muting individuals or blocking posts from certain sites, but with hundreds of friends, managing what pops up can be a full-time job.

It is hoped the changes, already available on desktops and coming to mobile apps over the next few weeks, will make managing the News Feed easier.
