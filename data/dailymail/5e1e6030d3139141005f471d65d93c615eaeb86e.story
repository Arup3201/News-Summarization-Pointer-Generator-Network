After the 35th annual BRIT Awards came to a chaotic end on Wednesday night there was one thing that had everyone talking.

It wasn't a showstopping dress on the red carpet or a drunken slurred speech - it was the moment 56-year-old Madonna took a tumble backwards mid-performance.

After failing to undo her Armani cloak, which she has since said was tied too tightly, Madonna fell down a set of stairs landing in a crumpled heap on the floor.

Madonna took a tumble at the BRIT Awards last night, the 56-year-old's fall was one of the most awkward moments in the award show's history

And although the singer pulled herself back up again and carried on her performance of Living For Love which ironically includes the line, 'Took me to heaven and let me fall down,' it was all anyone could talk about.

That, and Kanye West. 

The 37-year-old rapper was roped in to perform at the awards show last minute after Rihanna reportedly didn't show up for rehearsals on Monday.

However, he left a stunned audience opened-mouthed as he blasted out his new single All Day, which is includes the N-word said repeatedly.

And despite ITV's attempts to censor him, the word was heard three times on television, with many viewers taking to Twitter in droves to complain.

But Kanye and Madonna aren't the only people to have caused controversy at the infamously boozy awards show. 

Kanye's performance came under fire as he continuously used the N-word forcing ITV to mute his performance

Who can forget the time that Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage as Michael Jackson performed his hit song Earth Song in 1996.

The Pulp frontman pranced around in front of the late singer and eventually was chased off by one of his backing dancers.

There was also that time when Sharon Osbourne called comedian Vic Reeves a p***** b****** after he appeared to be drunk while  presenting an award in 2008.

From Alex Turner's rambling acceptance speech in 2014 to Chumbawamba throwing a jug of water over John Prescott in 1998, Femail looks back over the most awkward, and controversial, BRITs moments ever...

Last year Alex Turner gave an incredibly rambling acceptance speech seemingly slagging off the very industry that was honoring him 

2014: Alex Turner's Awards Speech

In 2014 the awkward BRIT Awards moment happened when Arctic Monkey's frontman Alex Turner gave an acceptance speech on behalf of the band for their Best British Group award. 

A rambling Turner lambasted the British music industry and claimed that rock 'n' roll wouldn't go away. 

He said: 'It will never die. And there's nothing you can do about it.' 

The speech was met with mass criticism as he seemed to be berating the very people who had given the band the accolade.

The singer then ended his rambling message by dropping his microphone on the floor and walking off, leaving the audience stunned. 

In the same year Harry Styles caused laughs throughout the event when he left his bandmates hanging around on stage as they collected their Global Success award.

The One Direction singer nearly missed his big moment because he was in the toilet. Running on stage in the nick of time he said: 'I'm really sorry I was having a wee, the toilets are ages away.' 

As James Cordon came up behind Adele, interrupting her acceptance speech she swore at the cameras live on television

2012: Adele Vs The Suits 

If there was one thing that didn't go down well at the BRIT Awards in 2012 it was when James Cordon interrupted Adele as she gave her acceptance speech for Album Of The Year. 

In a rush to introduce Blur and apparently spurred on by the show's producers James came on stage as Adele was making her thank yous and said, 'I'm so sorry, can I just cut off?'

The singer responded by asked the TV presenter to clarify what he was saying and when he conceded that she needed to end her speech, she stuck her middle finger up to the camera live on television.

Adele later said that she had been offended by the 'suits,' who had stopped her making her full acceptance speech and that she hoped she hadn't offended her fans. 

In 2010 Liam Gallagher not only snubbed his own brother when accepting the award for the 'Best Album of 30 Years'  missing Noel out of his acceptance speech

2010: Liam Gallagher didn't want his award and threw his microphone into the audience

Given his history of feuds, punch ups and all round bad behavior it's little wonder than Liam Gallagher has enjoyed a controversial BRIT moment.

In 2010 when he was awarded  a special 'Best Album of 30 Years,' award for (What's the story?) Morning Glory' not only did snub his own brother and bandmate, Noel, in his acceptance speech he went on to ramble for a full ten minutes.

Then, when he'd finally finished, Gallagher threw not only his microphone but his actual award into the audience.

It was reported that BRIT officials had to bargain with a fan to retrieve the statue and it meant the whole of the rest of the evening was delayed.

When the Osbournes presented they were characteristically sweary and Vic Reeves ended up being offended by Sharon

2008: The Osbournes got sweary and The Artic Monkeys dressed as farmers

When the Osbourne family were asked to present the awards in 2008 they clearly didn't get the 'no swearing on live television' memo. 

Not only did they fill the whole show with expletives, Sharon got particularly angry about comedian Vic Reeves. 

When he came on stage to present an the Best Album award Sharon deemed him too drunk to do the job after he stumbled over his words. She said to him: 'You’re p*****. P*** off you b******!'

The Arctic Monkey's speech had to be cut from ITV's broadcast after they began to slag off the Brit school 

Vic later said that it he had got confused over the autocue and felt offended by what Sharon had said.

Keeping the controversy flowing the Arctic Monkey's who won the award  that Vic was presenting came on stage and promptly began to slag off the BRIT school.

The band had attended the school from which the awards take their name, but Alex Turner proceeded to reveal that they hadn't had a very good time there. 

So bad was his speech that the producers of the show were forced to cut it short and not air it on the show.

Whilst accepting his award for the Best Song in 2000 Robbie decided to challenge Liam Gallagher to a fight 

2000: Robbie Williams called for a fight and DJ Brandon Block thought he'd won an award

At the 2000 BRIT Awards Robbie Williams decided to use his moment of air time to challenge Oasis front man Liam Gallagher to a fight. 

There had long been an issue between the two of them after Liam had called Robbie the, 'fat dancer from Take That.'  

An inebriated-seeming Robbie took to the stage whilst accepting his best British Song award and said to the audience: 'So, anybody like to see me fight Liam? Would you pay to come and see it?

'Liam, a hundred grand of your money and a hundred grand of my money. We'll get in a ring and we'll have a fight and you can all watch it on TV.'

Brandon stormed on stage thinking he had won an award and ended up with Ronnie Wood's drink in his face

Unfortunately despite Robbie's bravado and willingness to fight Liam, the event never ended up taking place. 

Robbie's speech wasn't the only awkward moment of the night. As Ronnie Wood was presenting the 'Best Soundtrack' award DJ Brandon Block's friends joked to him that he had won.

Unfortunately Block was so drunk at the time that he believed them stumbling on stage to collect his honour. 

When he was challenged by Ronnie, who called him a c***, Brandon tried to get into a fight with the Rolling Stones drummer and eventually ended up with his drink in his face. 

Chumbawumba performed at the BRITs in 1998 and later the lead singer Danbert Nobacon chucked a bucket of ice cold water over John Prescott 

1998: Chumbawumba gave  John Prescott a soaking

Two very odd things happened at the BRIT Awards in 1998. Firstly John Prescott was invited to the awards. 

Secondly, while he was happily sitting at his table he ended up having a bucket of water thrown over his head by lead singer of the band Chumbawumba, Danbert Nobacon.

Danbert showed no regret at his actions and said: 'If John Prescott has the nerve to turn up at events like the BRIT Awards in a vain attempt to make Labour seem cool and trendy, then he deserves all we can throw at him.' 

John Prescott looked pretty unimpressed after having a bucket of ice cold water thrown over him when he attended the BRIT Awards in 1998

It was during this Michael Jackson performance at the BRIT Awards in 1996 that Jarvis Cocker jumped on stage and mooned the audience 

1996: Jarvis Cocker mooned Michael Jackson

Perhaps one of the most infamous moments in BRITs history was when Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage during Michael Jackson's performance of Earth Song in 1996. 

Jarvis, the Pulp singer, took to the stage and ran around bending over and showing his bottom to the world as the late singer performed.

Jarvis was pictured after the event swigging Champagne from the bottle - he later revealed he wasn't happy with the fact that Michael had been trying to play god 

Jarvis later said that he acted the way he did because he couldn't handle the fact that Michael was pretending to be Jesus. 

He said: 'He was pretending to be Jesus - I'm not religious but I think, as a performer myself, the idea of someone pretending to have the power of healing is just not right.

'Rock stars have big enough egos without pretending to be Jesus - that was what got my goat, that one particular thing.'

When Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood presented the awards in 1989 it was a total disaster, the pair kept on messing up the autocue and fluffing their lines

1989: The Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood co-presenting disaster

In 1989 the show's producers made an attempt to revamp the BRITs bringing in the odd combination of the Page 3 model Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac to present. 

The twosome had a disastrous show. Guests came on at the wrong time, they fluffed their lines and they had a pre-recorded Michael Jackson speech which they forgot to air altogether.
