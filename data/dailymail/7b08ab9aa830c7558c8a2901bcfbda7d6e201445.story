In 1984, the year Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Relax finally hit the top of the UK charts, Britons' destination of choice was Spain followed by France.

Thirty years on, with Taylor Swift telling us to Shake It Off, France has dropped out of the top three altogether and Spanish is relegated to third place. 

When it comes to a short haul holiday the nation's favourite is now Italy leading with 11.7 per cent, according to an independent survey by One Poll commissioned by James Villas.

Attractions such as the Colosseum have made Italy Britons' most desired short haul travel destination

Spain was No 1 for Brits' short breaks when Mezquita and the Old Town of Cordoba where designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1984

Greece came in second place with six per cent, and Spain back in third with 5.9 per cent.

Meanwhile, Australia has overtaken the States as the preferred long haul destination.

When asked where they most wanted to go for a big trip in 1984, 25.1 per cent of Brits said the US, with Australia top of 10.5 per cent of wish lists followed by Japan with two per cent.

Now it's tight, but the Aussies have our undivided attention with 20.4 per cent followed by the us with 18.4 per cent and Japan with a significant increase in interest at 6.9 per cent.

In that period overseas travel by Brits has more than doubled and trends have changed drastically, of course, with the advent of new technology. 

Now 72 per cent of holidaymakers book breaks online, 41 per cent of us demand to be able to switch on to wi-fi while switching off away from home. 

Australia, with landmarks such as Sydney's Bondi Beach a favourite with tourists, is No 1 for long haul

According to the survey of 2,700 people,  a third of us wouldn't entertain the idea of a digital detox and 33 per cent could not go an entire trip away without a mobile phone. 

While online booking is the top choice for locking in reservations, a number of major websites influence our travel choices - 42 per cent of people peruse TripAdvisor, 14 per cent look at Facebook and six per cent say Twitter has a bearing on where they head in their time off. 

Back in 1984, spending quality time with loved ones was our top priority at 51 per cent but now with the stresses of modern-day life 64 per cent of us say relaxing is No 1. Seeing new sights is still second up from 42 per cent to 58 per cent while family and friends now lag in third.

Yet the more things chance the more they stay the same - the number one item we still consider essential on holiday is a good book.
