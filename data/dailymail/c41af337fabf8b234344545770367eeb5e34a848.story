The scores of Manchester United fans heading back to London by train on Sunday evening forced QPR to travel 194 miles by coach after their 4-0 thrashing at Old Trafford, joked Harry Redknapp.

So the QPR manager might have been a tad jealous of his son's method of transport for the day.

Jamie Redknapp, a columnist for Sportsmail and pundit for Sky Sports, was pictured travelling in style to Manchester in a private jet alongside cricket star Kevin Pietersen.

The duo were among the guests of Amit Bhatia, the QPR co-owner and businessman, who is married to the daughter of billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, and both looked to be enjoying the ride in a series of pictures shared by the former England cricket captain.

Pietersen is a self-confessed 'plastic Chelsea fan' but is friends with Bhatia. 

Spirits were still in the sky when the party landed in Manchester, with Bhatia saying on Twitter: 'Arrived in Manchester to watch QPR vs Man Utd. Excited for today, come on urrrsssss. If we get a point #drinksonme.'

While Redknapp left the party to concentrate on his professional duties for the match, Pietersen enjoyed a meal with Bhatia's friends, which was finished off with a shot a tequila. England's all-time top runscorer  posted a picture of the toast with the conclusion: '#messy'.

But by the end of the game, in which goals from Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata secured Louis van Gaal's first victory as United boss, QPR hopes had been brought back down to earth.

Bhatia echoed Tony Fernandez's thoughts when he retweeted the QPR chairman's message: 'Tough tough game. Unfortunately we have a couple of injuries. But squad better. Tense. Go out and enjoy boys. Play with pride and the badge'.

Redknapp snr would surely have repeated those thoughts to his players as they travelled back to London... slowly, on a bus.
