Derby County have revived interest in Fulham's Ross McCormack.

The Championship promotion hopefuls had made enquiries about signing Jordan Rhodes from Blackburn Rovers but the Ewood Park club's reluctance to deal has prompted fresh questions about McCormack.

The Scotland international made an £11million move from Leeds in the summer but the move has backfired with Fulham falling perilously close to the relegation places in recent weeks.

McCormack, 28, has still managed 12 goals in a struggling side and Derby are keen to see if Fulham will loan him with a view to a permanent deal should they go up.

Fulham's form is poor with just three wins this year and they are unlikely to want to lose one of their best forwards.

They have an eight point cushion between themselves and Wigan and plan a re-structure in the summer should they survive.

Second-placed Derby face promotion rivals Norwich on Saturday.
