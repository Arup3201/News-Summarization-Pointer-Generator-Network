It wasn't one for the scrapbook, but Ronald Koeman won't care a jot.

When Sadio Mane fired home eight minutes from time, not only did it end a run of three games without a win - it ended a 387 minute spell without a home league goal.

This wasn't a display that said much for Southampton's Champions League credentials, nevertheless their top-four dream is still alive after this scrappy win over Crystal Palace.

'We scored and we won at home, so I'm relieved, but I can't say we deserved to win,' said Koeman.

'It's all about confidence and we didn't have that tonight. But I think it can one of the key moments in our season.

'Qualifying for the Champions League will be difficult, but we will try our best.'

Palace manager Alan Pardew wasn't as contented in his post-match press conference, however.

The Eagles boss was angered by referee Martin Atkinson's decision not to award the his side a second half penalty after Jose Fonte bundled over Yannick Bolasie in the 70th minute.

'Fonte was over aggressive in the box,' insisted Pardew.

'It should have been given, but we've been harshly treated by officials in the last few games and sometimes you get a run like that.'

In response to Pardew's comments, Koeman said: 'It's easy to tell that story after losing game, the ref wasn't involved in final result.

'We scored, they didn't. I know that feeling, it's too easy and people talk too much about referees. I don't like that.'

Pardew may change his mind once he sees replays of Fonte's shoulder-to-shoulder collision with Bolasie.

Perhaps the Palace manager, who was without skipper Mile Jedinak, who on Tuesday accepted a four match suspension for elbowing Diafra Sakho on Saturday, was trying to mask his disappointment at leaving the south coast with nothing when they could easily have left with all three points.

The fact Palace players hardly appealed for a spot-kick tells its own story.

Southampton enjoyed the upper hand during the opening exchanges, Filip Djurcic fashioning the first chance, controlling Victor Wanyama's mishit shot only to fire over the bar in the 11th minute.

But despite their dominance in terms of possession, this looked a Southampton side void of invention in the final third.

Even 25 minutes into the game, you could sense the anxiety from home supporters.

Earlier this week a local newspaper scrapped an idea to print full-page arrows for Saints fans to display  as a tongue-in-cheek reminder to players of where the opposition goal is.

But on the evidence of the opening 45 minutes, Koeman's side needed all the help they could get.

The anxiety in Southampton's attacking play even trickled back to their usually tight defence in the 36th minute, goalkeeper Fraser Forster misjudging a high ball, nearly allowing Wilfried Zaha to tap into an empty net.

Palace keeper Julian Speroni made the first real stop of the night in the 40th minute, saving Eljero Elia's shot from a half-cleared Morgan Schneiderlin corner at his near post.

The rebound fell to Pelle, but the struggling striker could only stab his effort wide from close range.

During the opening months of the season, the ball would have nestled in the back of the net for the Italian. 

How he must long for those heady days. So to must have Koeman as he faced up to yet another half-time team talk without a goal from his side.

Likewise, Palace offered next to nothing in the attacking third during the opening 45 minutes, nevertheless Pardew would have been satisfied with the outcome of their first half.

He'd have been even happier if Forster hadn't produced an excellent save from Jason Puncheon in the 48th minute after the former Saints forward turned Maya Yoshida brilliantly in the box. 

Seven minutes later the visitors went even closer, Zaha hitting the inside of Forster's far post after the England goalkeeper's initial save from Bolasie.

Koeman replaced Elia with Dusan Tadic just before the hour mark in search of attacking impetus, Shane Long and Shane Ward-Prowse soon followed.

Saints boss Koeman was fearing another goalless 90 minutes from his side in the 69th minute when Maya Yoshida somehow fired wide from three yards after Schneiderlin's corner.

But eight minutes from time, St Mary's erupted as Mane fired home after Speroni failed to hold from Ward-Prowse's shot.
