Andrew Thomas can still remember the moment in August 1992 that he received a call offering him a position in the astronaut program at NASA.

'I remember putting the phone down and thinking, wow, my life has just changed in ways I can't begin to imagine. How does this happen? A kid from Adelaide has just joined NASA,' he told MailOnline.

With the offer, Dr Thomas, 62, became the first Australian to travel into space. He has just hung up his space helmet, retiring after a 22-year career with NASA, which has seen him undertake four space flights, 177 days in orbit, a visit to the Mir space station, and a space walk.

Andrew Thomas completed four space flights during his 22 years as an astronaut. On his 1998 stay on the Mir space station he went on a six and a half hour space walk. Pictured: Another astronaut on Dr Thomas's 2005 space walk undertaking a space walk

On each of his four missions Dr Thomas took with him an artefact from Australian exploration history. For his first mission, a flight on-board the space shuttle Endeavour in 1996, Dr Thomas took a fragment of wood from Captain James Cook's HMS Endeavour, from which the shuttle got its name.

'I wonder what Captain Cook would have thought about a piece of the ship orbiting the earth,' he said to MailOnline.

On his subsequent trips, the artefacts he carried included a slide rule from Douglas Mawson's Antarctic expedition, the watch worn by aviator Charles Kingsford-Smith, and the pilot wings of Ross Smith, who was the first person to fly from London to Australia in less than 30 days.

Carrying the objects was a way to honour the history of Australian exploration, something that was particularly important to Dr Thomas, who had to take up dual U.S. citizenship to become an astronaut, and was launched into space wearing a U.S. flag, not an Australian one, emblazoned on his space suit.

Dr Thomas grew up in Adelaide during the space race and watched in awe as the first humans ventured into space.

'I had a bent toward things spacey. I had read science fiction, I had read space books, and then seeing things unfold in the space race made it all very real,' he said. 'But of course for a kid growing up in Adelaide it wasn't a real prospect at all.'

Dr Thomas received a first-class honours degree and later a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of Adelaide but said that if someone had told him at his graduation ceremony that his career would see him follow his astronaut heroes he simply would not have believed them.

'I would have thought someone was on drugs. It's totally absurd. It wasn't until my late 20s that I realised I had accrued the sort of credentials that might make this possible, and then I made a very serious commitment to pursuing it.'

The commitment included moving to the U.S., being selected from thousands of applicants, subjected to psychological evaluations and interviews, as well as a 'very serious medical examination' in which he said 'they poke and prod at you in ways that you couldn't begin to imagine.'

Dr Thomas spent more than four months living on the Mir space station (pictured) in 1998. In preparation for the trip he spent a long time training in Russia and said that being a cosmonaut seemed even more far-fetched than being an astronaut

His first flight was not until 1996, when he travelled on the space shuttle Endeavour. Before take-off he remembers lying on the launch pad thinking, 'I don't know how the next 10 minutes are going to go.'

'It's the most extraordinary ride you can ever imagine,' he said.

During its first orbit, the space shuttle flew over Australia and the premier of South Australia had encouraged Adelaide's residents to turn on their lights at the time the space shuttle was due to fly over the city.

'And they did and I saw it, it was amazing,' he said.

Dr Thomas said that Australia is actually very easy to spot from space.

'It is so strikingly red, it contrasts against the blue ocean. I remember many great views of Australia, flying over it.'

Other highlights for Dr Thomas included seeing the Aurora Australis – 'these beautiful green, iridescent, shining, shimmering lights over Antarctica' – and completing a six-and-a-half hour space walk.

'I was high up on the trusses, on the dark side of the earth and I turned away from the space station.

'It was a blackness that was absolutely amazing, I've never seen anything as black and dark as looking out into infinity, just seeing the space station suspended in that nothingness.'

In 1998, Dr Thomas spent 130 days aboard the Russian Space Station Mir and was the last astronaut from NASA to visit it.

He said that life in zero gravity is 'very unnatural' but something he adjusted to very quickly.

'It's a great feeling,' he said. 'Scuba-diving is the nearest approximation, but even when you're scuba-diving there is a definite up and down, but in space there is no up.'

This presents a particular problem for sleeping, he said, which requires the astronaut to tie their sleeping bag somewhere and zip themselves in.

'You zip yourself in or you'll float out of it during the night,' he said.

Dr Thomas is married to a fellow astronaut, American Shannon Walker, with whom he lives in Houston, Texas.

She went on her first space flight in 2010, an experience which gave Dr Thomas 'a much deeper appreciation for what [people] go through when they watch their better halves launch'.

Initial fears give way to enjoyment of the experience, and in the end as he watched his wife launch 'there's a certain amount of envy actually and you think that's fantastic.'

Apart from a wish that he could have visited the moon, Dr Thomas says he has no complaints about his extraordinary career.

He will spend his retirement building a house on some ranch property that he and his wife purchased in central Texas and doing speaking engagements.

'I think I've got a good story to tell. To tell young people to aim high – the sky is not the limit!'
