The parents of a toddler who died in a day home mystery have spoken of their pride after their young daughters organs have since been used to give life to four children.

Mackenzy Woolfsmith was rushed from a day home on Elgin Heath S.E. in Calgary last Wednesday after reports she had fallen down the stairs.

Two days after being found not breathing, her devastated parents made the agonising decision to take the 21-month-old off life support.

But after making the heart-wrenching decision, her parents Jen and Dan Woolfsmith also decided to donate their daughters organs.

In their first public statement since the girl's tragic death on Friday, the Woolfsmiths revealed Mackenzy's organs have since been used to give life to four other youngsters.

Mr and Mrs Woolfsmith said that, as a result, they were 'proud of their little girl' and the difference she had made in other children's lives.

The statement said: 'With her generous donation, four babies now have chances at amazing lives.

'She brought so much happiness to so many people during her short time with us, she loved to share and this was her biggest gift.

'Please consider being an organ donor, it really does save lives.'

Police are still investigating the 
circumstances surrounding Mackenzy's death, with her parents urging 
everyone not to jump to conclusions.

They
added: 'We recognize that everyone wants answers, and so do we, but 
please allow the investigative process to be completed before jumping to
conclusions about the circumstances around the accident.'

Calgary police duty inspector Darren Leggatt said: 'The homicide unit is heading up that investigation.

'They
should have more information after the autopsy takes place and be able 
to provide more information as to what stage the investigation is at and
where itâ€™s going.'

A trust fund has since been set up in Mackenzy's honour. Donations can be made at any RBC branch. The account is in the name of Mackenzy Woolfsmith.
