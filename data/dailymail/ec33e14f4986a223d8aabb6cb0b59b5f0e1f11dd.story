School governors will have to demonstrate 'fundamental British values', under new rules set to be introduced in the wake of the Trojan horse 'plot' to radicalise school children.

The Education Secretary Michael Gove has also listed for the first time the set of 'British values' which all schools must promote to combat extremism.

Under new Department for Education rules new academies and free schools must promote 'respect for the law, democracy, equality and tolerance of different faiths, religions and other beliefs'.

Education Secretary Michael Gove and the Home Secretary Theresa May clashed over how to combat extremism in schools. Mr Gove wants the Government to take a harder line on Muslim radicals, but Mrs May fears this could drive school children into the hands of the jihadis

But one Islamic group said some conservative Muslims could effectively end up being be barred from becoming school governors by the measures.

The Muslim Council of Britain said the proposals were 'frankly speaking, quite dangerous'.

Talha Ahmad, a senior member of the MCB, said: 'People may have different views, and those views might be informed by faith.

'But does that mean the secretary of state should have the power to arbitrate these ideas, so much so that they should not be part of an educational establishment?'

Ministers insist the move is necessary in wake of a damning Ofsted report which claimed children in six Birmingham schools were at risk of radicalisation.

School inspectors found hardline Muslim governors led an 'organised campaign' to change the character of ordinary state schools.

The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' by Ofsted inspectors investigating allegations of a 'Trojan horse' plot to radicalise pupils 

Governors at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils.

The Education Secretary, reacting to the findings, revealed how one school had played the Muslim call to prayer over loudspeakers in the playground while another had invited a hate preacher to speak even though he had previously called for 'victory to the Muslims in Afghanistan'.

Mr Gove also attacked a school for banning non-Muslim pupils from subsidised school trips to Saudi Arabia.

The Education Secretary's statement came after school inspectors Ofsted found a 'culture of fear and intimidation' had developed in some schools in the city.

Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw also warned that Birmingham City Council had failed to support a number of schools in their efforts to protect pupils from the 'risks of radicalisation and extremism'.

Some headteachers told inspectors that there had been an organised campaign to target certain schools in the city to change their 'character and ethos', Sir Michael said.

Lee Donaghy, the assistant principal of Birmingham's Park View School which was placed in special measures over fears children were at risk of radicalisation, said many of the concerns over Muslim extremists were 'plain old Islamaphobia'

He concluded: 'In several of the schools inspected, children are being badly prepared for life in modern Britain.'

Following the revelations David Cameron said there had been a 'worrying' failure to push British values in schools and society. He said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the Magna Carta.

The Prime Minister's intervention came after teachers were told by the Education Secretary Michael Gove that they must in future 'actively promote British values'.

Mr Cameron said these values would include 'a belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law'.

The new rules, revealed in the Guardian today, forcing schools to promote British values have been inserted into the funding agreement between academies or free schools and the Government.

The new wording will apply to all free schools and academies opening or schools converting to academy status.

Under the existing legal agreement the education secretary was only able to cut off a school's funding if there had been 'a serious breakdown in the way the academy is managed or governed' or if the Government regarded a governor as 'not a suitable person'.

But the department's new rules allow ministers to close the school or dismiss its governors if they think any member of the academy trust is 'unsuitable' - if they have done anything 'aimed at undermining the fundamental British values'.

A Department for Education spokesman dismissed claims that the rules were a threat to Muslims.

'There is absolutely no bar to Muslims becoming school governors,' the spokesman said.

'We want a diverse range of people, of all faiths and none, to serve on governing bodies.

'It is right that unsuitable people should not be able to become governors.

'We are clear that any behaviour which undermines the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs is incompatible with being a governor in a state-funded school in England.'
