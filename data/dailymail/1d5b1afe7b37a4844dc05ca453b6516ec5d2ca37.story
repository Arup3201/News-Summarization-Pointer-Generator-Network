Roya Saberi Negad Nobakht was arrested as she stepped off a plane in the provincial city of Shiraz and accused of being a spy

A student visiting family in Iran has been locked up for five months after writing on Facebook that the country 'was too Islamic' during a family trip.

Roya Saberi Negad Nobakht, from Stockport, was arrested as she stepped off a plane in the provincial city of Shiraz and accused of being a spy, said her husband Daryoush Taghipoor.

Daryoush said his 47-year-old wife has been detained at Evin, a prison in the capital Tehran, on suspicion of plotting to commit crimes against security and insulting Islam.

He claims her arrest was over 
comments she made on an internet chat forum and to friends on Facebook 
about the Iranian government being too controlling and ‘too Islamic’.

Part-time
 chef Daryoush and Roya, an English student at Stockport College, have 
lived in Heald Green for six years and are naturalised British citizens.

Daryoush, 47, said his wife had done nothing wrong and feared for her life.

Speaking from Iran, he added: 'It’s a very bad situation. We don’t know what’s going on.

'Roya is not well at all. She has lost three stone and is frightened. She is scared that the government will kill her.'

Roya travelled to Tehran to see family last October.

About two weeks into the trip, she flew to Shiraz to visit a friend and was arrested at the airport.

It is understood she is being remanded in Evin prison while she awaits a trial.

Family
 friend Nasser Homayoun-Fekri, from Offerton, has written to his MP 
Andrew Stunell, asking him to put pressure on our government to 
intervene.

Mr Fekri said: 'Roya is not a political activist in any way. She is just a normal citizen.

'The
 authorities don’t clarify why she has been arrested and Daryoush 
insists the charges are based on a confession extracted from Roya under 
duress.

'The government needs to do all that is feasible to get the release of this innocent British citizen.'

The British Embassy in Tehran is closed but Ajay Sharma, head of the Iran department at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), is acting as a diplomat between the two countries.

Mr Stunell, Hazel Grove MP, said: 'I am concerned about this arbitrary arrest and am urgently asking the FCO to make inquiries.'
