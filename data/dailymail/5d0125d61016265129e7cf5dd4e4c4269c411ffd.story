A Romanian gang who used sophisticated new equipment to swallow bank cards and record PIN numbers are to be deported. 

The device used by the trio made it appear that a user’s card had been ‘swallowed’ by an ATM.

However, the cards were simply trapped inside a contraption so they could be retrieved later by the thieves, Gloucester Crown Court was told.

A mobile phone hidden inside the device photographed the user keying in his or her PIN number so the crooks would be able to use the cards later.

The court was told the Romanians obtained the device after finding it freely available for sale on the Internet.

However, their plot was quickly foiled by Gloucestershire police and the trio made less than £90 before they were arrested.

Cristian Tudor was jailed for 13 months for his part in the bank card scam

Two of the defendants had only been in the UK for a few weeks before launching the scam.

Lucien Dascalescu, 28, from Coventry, Mihai Dragan, 27, from Coventry and Christian Tudor, 21, from Leicester, all admitted conspiracy to steal by the use of a card trapping device allowing the PIN to be recorded and the card used for theft from the holder’s account.

Dascalescu and Dragan were jailed for 18 months each and Tudor for 13 months.

Recorder John Trevaskis told said: 'Due to quick action by the police they were able to nip in the bud what I am sure would have been a longer and more damaging pattern of crime.

'I find you made a choice to live by the proceeds of crime rather than by working and you spent what little money you had on buying the equipment which you had researched on the internet.'

After the case, PC Annabel Brittain of Gloucestershire police advised people to be vigilant when taking cash out of machines.

She said: 'I hope this case and the images of the device make people think harder about their security at cash machines or Chip and PIN devices. 

'The most important thing is to always cover your hand when typing your PIN.

'If you do that, you’re protecting yourself even if the criminals get your card or clone it because they won’t be able to use it at other machines.

'These devices aren’t complicated but they are effective and blend in well with the machine.

'If you can, take a moment to look around the cash machine you use, have a feel and see if anything sticks out or seems suspicious.

'I’m delighted these men have been convicted and jailed and I’m determined to make Gloucestershire a no go county for criminal gangs like this.

'The message is clear - if you intend to carry out scams like this here we are wise to you and you should think twice.'
