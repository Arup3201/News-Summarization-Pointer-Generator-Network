Actress Tatum O'Neal is today standing by her embattled son Kevin McEnroe following his drug arrest.

The 50-year-old former child star - who has struggled with her own drug demons - posted a picture of herself with her son, with the message: 'Addiction is a disease. Not a moral issue. Support, Empathy, Love.'

Tatum, who has three children with her ex-husband, tennis champ John McEnroe, also put up a picture of herself cuddling Kevin and her other kids, son Sean and daughter Emily.Scroll down for video

'Support, Empathy, Love.': Tatum O'Neal tweet this picture today of her and her son, Kevin McEnroe, 28, who was arrested in Manhattan yesterday

She simply wrote: 'Beautiful family!'

Kevin, 28, has been working at a bartender at a Lower East side bar in Manhattan after attending a $40,000-a-year private school and studying for a master's at Columbia University.

He was arrested late on Tuesday night after police say they saw him carry out the alleged ‘hand-to-hand’ drug deal in the middle of the street in the East Village.

Officers who searched Kevin reportedly found on him six small bags of cocaine and more than two dozen prescription pills.

They also discovered 10 morphine pills, 20 painkillers and an anti-anxiety tablet.

At his arraignment at Manhattan’s Criminal Court, Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Werner told the judge that the haul was so large that prosecutors doubted it was just for personal use.

Kevin is currently charged with 
criminal possession of a controlled substance in the Fifth Degree, a felony offence.

Prosecutor Miss Werner told the court: ‘Given the amount, we believe we have a strong possession-with-intent-to-sell case’.

the criminal complaint issued by Manhattan's DA office said: 'The defendant knowingly and unlawfully possessed a controlled substance with intent to sell it'.

Kevin, who was wearing a dark coat and jeans, looked on the verge of tears and did not say anything as the prosecutor read out the charges against him.

Police say they saw him carry out the alleged 'hand-to-hand' drug deal in the middle of the street in the East Village. Officers who searched Kevin reportedly found on him six small bags of cocaine and more than two dozen prescription pills. They also discovered 10 morphine pills, 20 painkillers and an anti-anxiety tablet

The court was told that he does not have a criminal history and he was released without bail.

Neither Kevin’s mother or father attended the hearing - and he was met by his uncle Mark McEnroe, who runs the John McEnroe Tennis Academy in New York, who led him away.

Kevin attended Trinity School in New York and was still at Columbia whilst working at the trendy Schiller’s Bar in New York. He has been living in a modest home in Gowanus, Brooklyn.

In a bizarre twist Kevin’s arrest happened a few blocks away from where his mother, Academy Award winning actress Tatum, 50, was arrested in 2008 for trying to buy crack during her own battle with drugs.

McEnroe, 55, a BBC commentator and former tennis champion, said that the entire family was supporting Kevin, 27, as he 'works through his issues'.

A statement read: 'The entire McEnroe family is extremely upset with regard to recent developments about Kevin McEnroe.

'This is a private matter, and his entire family will do everything we can to support Kevin as he works through his issues at this very difficult time.'

Kevin's defence lawyer Isabelle Kirshner however said there was 'certainly nothing remarkable' about the amount of drugs found on him in an attempt to play down the significance of his buy.

Kevin’s alleged drug dealer Niro Meneses, 22, who lives on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, was charged with criminal sale and criminal possession of a controlled substance.

He was held on a $10,000 bond or $3,500 cash bail.

McEnroe is known as the original tennis bad boy but his family life was where the real drama was.

He and O'Neal met when he was 25 and she was 20 and despite a whirlwind romance things soured badly.

The couple got married in 1986 and divorced in 1994, with McEnroe taking custody of the three children because O’Neal was battling her heroin addiction which had been an issue since the age of 14.

At one point things got so bad that he banned her from even seeing the kids.

In his 2002 memoir, which was called: 'You cannot be serious', McEnroe told how when he split with O'Neal she said to him: 'One day you'll thank me for this'.

John wrote that at the time he did not know what she meant - but that in hindsight he thought she was blaming herself.

He wrote: 'She realised she was such 
trouble, and so incapable of being the wife that I wanted, that 
eventually I'd be happier with somebody else'.

O'Neal
 was outraged when she heard his comments and claimed that he used 
steroids while on the pro-tennis tour, something he later admitted but 
claimed he did not know what they were.

Elsewhere
 in his memoir McEnroe also McEnroe wrote about 'screaming arguments' 
and 'long silences' that doomed their marriage and how O'Neal became 
jealous because his career was on the rise while she struggled to get 
parts.

McEnroe wrote that he and O'Neal used cocaine too, only on a modest scale.

The arrival of Sean, their second child, put even more strain on their relationship and when O'Neal nearly miscarried John wondered if they should even have the child at all.

McEnroe has two more children from his second marriage to singer Patty Smyth.
