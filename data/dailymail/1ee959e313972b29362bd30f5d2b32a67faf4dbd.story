The protester who gate-crashed the Australian Open men's final has apologised to Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and the 'tennis heads' at the game - but has said she would do it again to raise awareness about the plight of asylum seekers in Australia.  

'I would absolutely do it again and again and again,' said Karoline Morwitzer, 32, on Radio 3AW this morning. 

The community arts worker told Daily Mail Australia about the 'scary' and 'overwhelming' moment she and a friend were grabbed by security after they stormed the court.

Play was halted for five minutes while the activists were carried away from the court, with many in the crowd booing. 

Around six other people in the front row joined the demonstration, wearing shirts: 'Australia Open for refugees' or 'Shut Down Manus Island'.

Two women rushed onto the court yelling and waving banners which declared: ‘Australia Open for refugees #ShutdownManus', whilst another banner was also unfurled by another five supporters in the front row

'This issue was bigger than the tennis, bigger than Rod Laver Arena and something we felt every person in Australia better be thinking critically and consciously about,' she said. 

'I would say to the players -  as well to all the tennis heads - I send an apology to them but reiterate that this issue is bigger than the tennis game.' 

But Ms Morwitzer refused to go into detail about how expensive their protest was and how much planning was involved. 

'I'm going to continue to skirt that particular aspect because it may affect the charges,' Ms Morwitzer said.  

The Tennis Australia price guide said tickets purchased prior to the tournament commencing cost $390 for adults. 

'It's something every person in Australia needs to be thinking very very deeply - legitimising torture and abuse.'

The Manus Island immigration detention facility, also known as the Manus Island Regional processing centre, is an offshore asylum processing institution located in Papua New Guinea, which operates on behalf of the Australian Government.

Recently, the centre has been the subject of a number of protests which are angered by harsh treatment of detainees, who have been denied basic amenities as they bid for asylum.

The policy of detaining asylum seekers offshore - intended as an immigration deterrent - has been criticised by several human rights groups.

Following the court invasion, Australian Open officials released a statement on Twitter, confirming the arrests of two protesters.

The Australian Open Twitter account announced that both women were arrested for intruding on the court

'Two people have been arrested after a court invasion during the second set of the men's final,' they wrote.

'Security responded immediately. Both were quickly removed with minimal disruption to play.' 

Apparently unperturbed by the incident, Djokovic went on to beat Murray to claim his fifth Australian Open title. 

A team of around four security guards each formed a shield around the tennis players when the intruders broke out onto the court.

The Australian Open Men’s Final was televised live and was expected to draw in millions of viewers.

Channel 7 opted to delay the telecast for four minutes so the commotion caused by the protest and the slogan on the banner were not shown on television.

However, photos of the incident quickly circulated online, particularly on social media.

The group who organised the protest are  called Australia Open for Refugees.

'We have created this international media spectacle today to expose the torture, abuse, and horrific conditions that are being perpetrated on Manus Island," the group told SBS.

"We will not be silent. We are drawing a line with this issue. If we allow this to happen, there is no end to what this government is capable of."

Debate ensued when many took to social media, sharing a range of opinions on the unexpected protest.

‘Yeah, that "Australia open for refugees" sign did look threatening. Cant have human rights interrupt our entertainment,’ tweeted Steve Raymond.

‘Great protest at the Australian Open, from what I hear. Well done, whoever it was. MY country will ALWAYS be open for asylum seekers,’ wrote Sir Joseph d'Ananas

‘Why pay $400 bucks for a ticket and then decide to jump on court and protest. #Cowards #Gutless,’ wrote Michael Thompson.

‘Would like to applauded the @AustralianOpen security team. They had the protest dealt with at a blink of an eye,’ wrote Anita.

‘Congrats to the #refugee rights protesters for trying to get national attention,’tweeted Nicola Paris. 

The activists were protesting against the inhumane living conditions refugees suffer through whilst detained at Manus Island Processing Centre
