Hairdryers will be the next household gadget to be given the silent treatment by Sir James Dyson as he puts in a patent for a soundless model.

The inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner has registered plans for the gadget which shows diagrams of the 'hand-held blower with an insulating chamber'.

Sir James is widely known for his vacuum cleaners but he has more recently branched out into bladeless fans and the 'airblade' fast-drying hand dryer, The Guardian has reported. 

Design: The 'hairblade' hairdryer

Trolleyball A trolley that launched boats

Bagless vacuum cleaner The Dyson cleaner was the first bagless vacuum

Dyson Airblade Fast-working hand dryer

Air Multiplier Bladeless fan

The blueprint for the new hairdryer goes into detail about how it will work. The patent application shows air will flow through two chambers and out the front of the handheld device.

The bladeless fan was another 'noiseless' device and hairdressers will surely be first in line as standard hairdryers can be as loud as 75 decibels.

Sir James usually keeps his new designs under wraps and his patents closely guarded. He recently begun a legal battle with Samsung, claiming that the electronics giant ‘ripped off’ one of its inventions.

Inventor: Sir James Dyson closely guards his patents and his company now holds 3,000 for 500 inventions

The 66-year-old engineer said the South Korean company’s new MotionSync range ‘directly copied’ the steering mechanics of Dyson’s DC37 and DC39 models.

Dyson said it patented the central 
ball system – which allows a vacuum to move more easily around corners, 
table legs and over carpets – in 2009, and spent three years developing 
the design.

In 2009 a 
British judge ordered Samsung to pay Dyson about £600,000 after it tried
 to patent the UK firm’s ‘triple-cyclone’ suction technology.

A champion of British industry, Dyson
 spends nearly £1.5 million every week on research and development. The 
company now holds more than 3,000 patents for over 500 inventions.

He
 also supports up and coming inventors with The James Dyson Award that 
celebrates and encourages the next generation of design engineers.

It
 is run by the James Dyson Foundation, Sir James Dyson’s charitable 
trust, as part of its mission to inspire young people about design 
engineering.
