A gold ring made by the wealthy money lender who founded the Grosvenor Estate has been found in a field by a treasure hunter.

The 24-carat piece of jewellery was a 'mourning ring' made in memory of Hugh Audley, who owned the land where Buckingham Palace would later be built.

It was found near Tibenham in Norfolk by John Reed using his metal detector, and was yesterday declared treasure trove by a coroner. 

Treasure: This mourning ring was made in memory of Hugh Audley, a famous money lender 

Discovery: The ring was found by enthusiast John Reed using his metal detector in Tibenham, Norfolk 

Hugh Audley was one of the most famous - and notorious - money lenders of the 17th century, and was worth the equivalent of £30million when he died.  

He owned land across Mayfair, which was then on the edge of London, including the plot where Buckingham Palace would later be built.  

Audley Street in Mayfair, now home to upmarket art galleries and exclusive restaurants, is named after its former landlord. 

Among the businesses on the street which cater to the ultra-rich are rifle makers James Purdey & Sons and the Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant Kai Mayfair. 

Property: Audley owned the land where Buckingham Palace now stands, then just outside London

Home: The remains of Old Buckenham Castle, one of the many properties owned by Audley

Legacy: Audley Street in Mayfair is named after the landowner and money lender

Audley also became sheriff of Norfolk, and owned land across the county including Old Buckenham Castle, New Buckenham Castle and Tibenham Hall.

After he died in 1662, he passed his fortune to a great-nephew, and it was eventually inherited by the Grosvenor family from which the Duke of Westminster is descended.

The Grosvenor Estate still owns swathes of central London, centred on the ultra-wealthy areas of Mayfair and Belgravia.

Audley also left a number of mourning rings to his family, like the one found by Mr Reed.

Mourning rings were usually commissioned by people coming to the end of their lives and bequeathed to their descendants in order to ensure that their memory was perpetuated down the generations. 

The rings were made of precious metals and jewels, and often contained a lock of the deceased person's hair. 

'According to Mr Audley's will, he had 11 rings made in two different sizes - one to fit men and the other for women,' Mr Reed said. 

'I haven't heard that any of the others are in existence.'  

Burial place: Hugh Audley was laid to rest in the Temple Church after he died in 1662 

Hugh Audley (1577-1662) apparently started his career with just £100, and was worth £400,000 - the equivalent of around £30million - by the time he died.

He was known as a philosopher and a lawyer - but it was as a money lender that he made his vast fortune and won widespread notoriety.  

Audley used his riches to invest in land, with his most prominent estate being the manor of Ebury in what is now Mayfair.  

He bought the land from Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex, who was desperate for money to pay his debts, and after his death passed it on to his great-nephew.  

The estate was then inherited by Mary Davies, who married an ancestor of the current Duke of Westminster, now one of London's biggest landowners.

Audley was buried in the Temple Church, befitting his status as a lawyer - but his death brought forward a stream of invective from those he had taken advantage of.  

A pamphlet on his life entitled 'The Way to be Rich' claimed that he had lived 'a life of intricacies and misteries, wherein he walked as in a maze', while a later author wrote: 'His whole life was one of trickery and disreputable craft.'  

In the Victorian era, Audley was remembered as 'a most heartless blood-sucker' and was posthumously condemned by Benjamin Disraeli.

The enthusiast added: 'I am so excited about it.

'I have found some lovely 13th-century thimbles but not something you can associate with a specific person like this.  

'If I keep metal detecting for the next 20 years, I don't think I will ever find anything as good as this.'  

The ring is currently being held at the British Museum, and its fate has yet to be determined after the coroner ruled that it should pass into the hands of the Crown.

The Grosvenor Estate, which includes much of central London, is one of the largest and wealthiest landowners in Britain.

It is now owned by the 6th Duke of Westminster, a member of the Grosvenor family, but it has its origins in the property owned by Hugh Audley.  

The Grosvenor family inherited the Ebury estate, covering most of what is now Mayfair, Belgravia and Pimlico, via Audley's great-niece Mary Davies.

They started developing the area in the 18th century, starting with Grosvenor Square before stretching down into the areas around Eaton Square and Chester Square.

Belgravia developed into a popular neighbourhood thanks to the purchase of Buckingham Palace by King George III in 1761, with the area's stylish Regency architecture capturing the neo-classical spirit of the age.

The areas owned by the Grosvenor Estate was one of the first extensions of London beyond the traditional boundaries of the City and Westminster, transforming regions once thought of as suburban or even rural into fashionable central London neighbourhoods.

Much of the estate is named after properties owned by the Grosvenor family - for example, Eaton Square is named after their country seat of Eaton Hall in Cheshire, while Wilton Crescent is named for their relative the Earl of Wilton.

While parts of the estate have been sold off over the centuries, the Grosvenor Group still owns much of central London as well as properties in other cities around Britain and elsewhere.

The group holds large portfolios in cities including Liverpool, Edinburgh, Shanghai, Tokyo and Washington DC.

The company is run by professional property executives, but its only shareholders are a group of trustees who manage the holding on behalf of the Grosvenor family.

Thanks to the family's extensive holdings, the current Duke of Westminster is worth £7.8billion, putting him at number eight on the Rich List - and everyone above him was born abroad.  

He grew up on an island in the middle of Northern Ireland's Lough Erne before being educated at Harrow, where he obtained two O-levels.

The Duke then went to Sandhurst and became an officer in the North Irish Horse, later working the the Ministry of Defence as Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff.  

The Grosvenors are one of the few British families to be wealthier than the Royals, but there are close links between the Duke of Westminster and the Windsors.

One of the Duke's personal properties is a hunting estate in Cordoba, southern Spain where Princes William and Harry went for a shooting holiday earlier this year.

His son Earl Grosvenor is godfather to Prince George and his daughter Lady Tamara is married to Edward van Cutsem, a family friend of the Duke of Cambridge.

Another daughter, Lady Edwina Grosvenor, is married to television presenter Dan Snow, whose father is political pundit Peter Snow.
