Governments' refusal to send troops and the World Health Organisation's bungling response to Ebola has cost lives, aid charities say.

A catalogue of errors has led to the outbreak teetering on the brink of becoming the 'definitive humanitarian disaster of our generation', Oxfam said as it made a rare appeal for troops to be sent to west Africa.

The charity accused world powers that did not send soldiers of 'costing lives', warning that there was a two-month window to curb the spread of the virus.

Oxfam added that while it was possible to stop the spread of the virus, there is still a lack of logistical support, making the task near impossible.

A 'brain drain', which has seen medical staff leave the worst-affected nations to countries such as Britain, has left parts of western Africa ill-equipped to deal with the crisis.

According to The Observer, Medecins Sans Frontieres executive director Vickie Hawkins said: 'We are angry that the global response to this outbreak has been so slow and inadequate.

'We have been amazed that for months the burden of the response could be carried by one single, private medical organisation, while pleading for more help and watching the situation get worse and worse. 

West Africa's 'brain drain': Most of the brightest medical students moved to wealthier nations, leaving the virus-hit nations ill-equipped.

Slow to act: WHO and Western countries have been accused of reacting slowly to the crisis, with aid still only trickling through.

Incompetent workers: Dr Peter Piot, who discovered Ebola, says WHO's regional office in Africa did not act when the virus began to spread.

Lack of information: An internal report from WHO suggests people in the worst-affected nations were not made aware of how to deal Ebola.

Bureaucracy: The same leaked document says 'politically motivated appointments' held up the UN agency's response. 

Not enough money: World powers, including Italy, have been accused of not donating enough aid to countries tackling Ebola.

'When the outbreak is under control, we must reflect on how health systems can have failed quite so badly. But the priority for now must remain the urgent fight against Ebola – we simply cannot afford to fail.'

Ebola has claimed the lives of 4,500 people so far, with 8,914 infected, although the true number is far higher.

The worst-hit nations are Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. 

According to a leaked internal report from WHO, who are organising the international response to the crisis, serious mistakes were made while dealing with the virus' spread.

The report says the UN agency acted too slowly in its response to the initial Ebola outbreak and that 'politically motivated appointments' created too much bureaucracy.

'Nearly everyone involved in the response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall. A perfect storm was brewing,' it says.

While many of the richest countries have donated aid to the crisis-hit region, people have called on some nations to up their efforts.

The UK has donated £75million to the cause, more than all except the U.S., and David Cameron has called on other European countries to double their contribution.

The Prime Minister has also sent 750 troops to western Africa. 

More than 4,500 people have died from Ebola in western Africa, and this number will continue to grow until world leaders send more troops to the region, Oxfam said

Shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy said Ebola was an 'existential threat to some of the countries that are affected by it' in Africa.

Speaking on Sky News, he said: 'This has taken the entire world, including the United Kingdom, far too long to get to a position of dealing with this as effectively as it should.

'The early warnings of this were in March and April of this year and it's now taken the world until this moment to see the scale of the disaster.'

He said the UK was 'doing well' in the scale of its response but other countries had to do their bit.

'The fact is the founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg has given many more times the donations than countries like Italy. Ikea, the furniture warehouse, has given more or about the same as Italy.

'So there are countries that aren't doing enough and we have to say that publicly and we have to try and persuade them. But if countries like Italy won't do their bit we have also got to embarrass them.' 

Dr Peter Piot, who discovered the Ebola virus, said WHO had acted far too slowly. He said: 'It's the regional office in Africa that's the front line. And they didn't do anything. That office is really not competent.'

WHO refused to comment.
