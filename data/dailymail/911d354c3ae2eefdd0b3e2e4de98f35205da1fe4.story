Since giving birth to her daughter Arabella four months ago, Rebecca Ferguson has become the victim of cruel taunts about her size 12 post-pregnancy body. 

But the singer has now hit back at her critics and vowed to resist the pressure to slim down. 

Speaking to Fabulous magazine, the 28-year-old former X Factor star confessed that recent comments aimed at her weight, and questions about when she'll 'drop the post-baby pounds', have left her more determined than ever to stand up for herself.

Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight'

The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month 

She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.'

Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29.

And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids.

Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said, 'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny.

'I'm curvy, I've got thighs, but I'm not big. I eat healthily and I'm breastfeeding, so I know the weight will come off naturally.'

Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews.

But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around.

Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight.

The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week)

She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions.

'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' 

Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 

'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn)

Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella.

She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum.

The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. 

And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being.  

Rebecca flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the Brit Awards last month and says she's proud of her womanly shape
