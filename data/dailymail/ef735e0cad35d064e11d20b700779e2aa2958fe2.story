A testicular cancer survivor is taking on a range of gruelling challenges in a bid to raise money for the hospital that saved his life.

Charlie Penrose, 29, is going to walk from London to Cornwall, kayak across the Channel and cycle from London to Paris to raise money for King’s College Hospital.

He is also going to take part in an ironman triathlon and try to climb the highest peaks in England, Wales and Scotland.

Charlie Penrose, 29, was diagnosed with testicular cancer after finding a lump in December 2013. He is now raising money for King's College Hospital as he believes the staff there saved his life

He told MailOnline: ‘I can’t repay the staff for what they did – I couldn’t have asked for anything better.

‘I just want to do what I can to say thank you.’

Mr Penrose, from Brixton, south London, was diagnosed with testicular cancer after finding a lump in December 2013.

When he went to see his GP he was immediately referred for a CT scan at King’s College Hospital.

Within a week of seeing his doctor, he had surgery to remove the affected testicle.

Mr Penrose, who works in marketing, told MailOnline: ‘They were amazing. My experience couldn’t have been more positive.

Mr Penrose had to have a testicle removed and had a course of chemotherapy in a bid to stop the cancer returning. He is now cancer-free but will continue to have regular check-ups

‘I didn’t really have time to take it in – I just rolled with it. It was only after Christmas when I went home that I started to absorb what had happened.’

Mr Penrose also had a course of chemotherapy in January to prevent the cancer returning.

This wiped out his immune system meaning he was instructed to stay at home for 10 days.

Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15-44 and affects 2,000 each year in the UK.

The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in one testicle, but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen.

A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom.

People with an undescended testicle have a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history of the disease.

It is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men.

It is one of the most treatable cancers - 97 per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis.

Once someone has been free of the disease for five years they are considered to be effectively cured.

He will now have to have monthly check-ups for a year and then regular check-ups for a further nine years.

He said: ‘I’m feeling quite positive about it. There’s not a lot I can do other than check regularly.’

He added: ‘Testicular cancer has become less alien because of Movember – it’s been normalised.

‘You assume it won’t happen to you – even now I still have a bit of a reality check.’

Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15 to 44 and affects around 2,000 each year in the UK.

The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in part of one testicle, but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen.

A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom.

People with an undescended testicle have a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history of the disease and those with HIV or AIDS.

It is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men.

It is, however, one of the most treatable cancers - 97 per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis and 96 per cent survive for more than ten years.

Once someone has been free of the disease for five years they are considered to be effectively cured.

Since his recovery, Mr Penrose has decided to try and raise £10,000 for King’s College Hospital.

Mr Penrose will also take part in an Ironman Triathlon in Mexico at the end of the year

Mr Penrose will have to have monthly check-ups for a year and will then have less regular check-ups for the next nine years

He said: ‘I am pretty fit and healthy but this has really kicked me into doing some more active things.’Mr Penrose has already taken part in a 10km race in Richmond Park.

Next, in April, he will take on the Three Peaks Challenge which will see him attempt to climb Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon all in 24 hours.

In June he is set to attempt to cycle from London to Paris in just 24 hours and in July he will walk the 350 miles from London to Cornwall in five days.

Then, in August, he will spend six to eight hours kayaking across the English Channel and at the end of the year he will take part in an Ironman Triathlon in Mexico.

He told MailOnline: ‘The sky’s the limit really. I like to think what all of my treatment cost – that drives me on.’
