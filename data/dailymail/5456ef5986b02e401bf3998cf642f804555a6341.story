Sergio Garcia scooped more than £500,000 for finishing second at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational but the Spaniard was lucky not to be handed a hefty bill after breaking a spectator’s diamond ring with a wild drive.

Garcia, who lost out to Rory McIlroy despite taking a three-shot lead into the final round at Firestone, smashed his tee shot into the gallery at the third hole on Sunday, hitting a woman on the hand and knocking out the stone.

With the sparkler lost in the rough, Garcia helped look for it before giving the woman a signed ball and moving on, although he did ask for her number in case the diamond never turned up.

Happy: A crowd gets together as relief sets around for the woman as she finds the diamond to her ring

Precious: The woman was relieved to find the diamond to her ring after it went missing initially

Close call: Sergio Garcia was pipped to 1st place at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational by Rory McIIroy

Classy: Garcia helped the woman find the diamond as well as giving her a signed ball

Respect: Garcia embraces McIIroy after the latter's win at the WGC on Sunday

Garcia wasn’t out of pocket as the rock was found but a bogey on the par-four and a third straight birdie from McIlroy saw the lead change hands.

That sent the Northern Irishman on his way to a second successive victory after winning The Open and a return to the top of the world rankings.

McIlroy heads for this week’s US PGA Championship as the bookies’ favourite – as short as 9/2 with some firms with Garcia available at 20/1 as he looks to break his major duck.
