Arizona border patrol agents have seized a truck that looked identical to a 'U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service' vehicle - and found it was carrying $1.6 million worth of marijuana.

The truck is just the latest example of a 'cloned' or faked vehicle used by drug smugglers to get illegal substances across the Mexican border into the U.S., authorities have revealed.

Smugglers have used FedEx vans, AT&T service trucks, cloned police cars and even school buses to carry stashes of illegal drugs into the country, police in Texas told CBS.

Stopped: Border patrol agents in Tuscon, Arizona followed this truck that looked like a 'U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service' vehicle last week - but found it had $1.6 million of marijuana inside

Last week, agents
 spotted the white truck with official U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decals 
along a boundary fence in Douglas, Arizona, while responding 
to reports of possible drug smuggling.

When agents tried to contact 
the driver, the truck suddenly stopped and two people fled into 
Mexico.

When
 they opened up the truck, agents say they that they found 3,200 pounds 
of marijuana stashed in bundles inside the vehicle's flatbed.

Texas authorities said it is a trend they first noticed in 2007.

The real deal: The truck's insignia (pictured) was a perfect copy - but when border control tried to contact the driver, two men jumped out of the car and fled back into Mexico

Discovery: Agents stand over a massive stash they found inside -  3,200 pounds of marijuana in bundles

A police 
officer in George West, Texas, had attempted to pull over what looked 
like a Texas Department of Transportation or 'Tex-Dot' truck.

Officer Jorge
 Medina said the vehicle looked 'just like a typical Tex-Dot truck, from the 
exempt plates to the stickers, the insignia' - but he had noticed that the license plate belonged to a school district.

Dash cam footage shows the officer pulling over the vehicle and approaching it - before it suddenly speeds off.

He
 chased the vehicle before the driver lost control and the truck spun 
into an embankment - scattering bundles of marijuana across the road. 
Authorities said there was nearly a ton inside.

Suspicious: The first case was in 2007 when an officer noticed that this vehicle looked like a a Texas Department of Transportation truck but had a license plate belonging to a school district

Oops: The officer took chase until the truck crashed - scattering nearly a ton of marijuana across the road

Creative: Smugglers have used DirectTV and AT&T trucks as well as police cars and school buses

Since that incident, law enforcement officials in south Texas have kept their eyes open for cloned vehicles, Sheriff T. Michael O'Connor in Victoria County said.

'If you can think of it and name it, we have stopped it,' O'Connor said. 'Some of them are excellent.'

Others haven't been so good - including one truck with a sign spelled, 'Border Patron'.

The ruse is just the latest way to get drugs across the border, with smugglers previously using catapults, tunnels and panga boats to get drugs over.
