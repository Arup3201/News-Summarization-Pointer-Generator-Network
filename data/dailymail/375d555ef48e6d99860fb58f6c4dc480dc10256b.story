He has already won more than £50,000 in 
compensation and legal costs from the European Court of Human Rights 
over his detention in Iraq

An Iraqi terror suspect accused of plotting to blow up British soldiers could be allowed to return to this country after judges ruled he must be given his UK passport back.

Alleged explosives expert Hilal Al-Jedda was given asylum in this country in 1992 but returned home during the Iraq war where he was accused of plotting atrocities against coalition forces.

He was stripped of his British passport but appealed and yesterday won his case at the Supreme Court. Judges said taking his passport away was unlawful because it left him ‘stateless’ – in effect without a home country.

Hard at work: Coalitions forces in Iraq were believed to be the target of Hilal Al-Jedda's plots

Al-Jedda, whose case is legally aided, has already won more than £50,000 in compensation and legal costs from the European Court of Human Rights over his three-year detention in Iraq by coalition forces. The court found his internment amounted to a breach of his right to liberty.

Now ministers face the prospect of having to issue a new passport and allow the father of eight and his family back in.

MPs reacted with fury to the judgment. James Clappison, a senior member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘The public will be entitled to think there is something extremely wrong with the law in a case like this – when it appears national security and public safety cannot be properly taken into account.’ Al-Jedda, 56, came to the UK in 1992 with his first wife and sought asylum.

In 1998 they and their four children were given the right to remain here indefinitely and in 2000 were given British nationality. At that point, he automatically lost his Iraqi passport because the laws of that country did not allow dual nationals.

After divorcing his first wife he married again in 2002 and while still married took a third wife. He lives in Turkey with his third wife and all eight of his children. In September 2004 he left Britain for Iraq and was captured by US forces in Baghdad the following month. He was then transferred to the custody of British forces in Basra and held for three years.

Homeless: Al-Jedda argued it was unlawful that after seeking asylum in Britain and then having his passport was revoked he was left 'stateless'

On his release from the detention facility the then Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, stripped him of his passport. Using legal aid, he launched a series of appeals to try to get it back. He won his case at the Court of Appeal last year which ‘reluctantly’ ruled in his favour.

One judge said the outcome was ‘deeply unsatisfactory’ because of the threat ministers say he poses to Britain. Judges were told the reason for stripping him of his passport was the ‘atrocities’ the Islamic terrorist group he belonged to planned against coalition soldiers. He is accused of recruiting terrorists and smuggling explosives and detonators for roadside bombs.

Home Secretary Theresa May appealed to the Supreme Court, which yesterday ruled he must be given his passport back.

Lawyers for Mrs May argued that Al-Jedda could have applied to the Iraqi authorities to restore his nationality and that he had a right to a new Iraqi passport.

The court found that British law does not allow the Secretary of State to strip someone of their passport if they do not have another – even if they could apply for one from another country.

Before the 2002 Asylum Act ministers could make someone stateless if they were considered a sufficient threat to Britain, but that power was revoked.

Lawyers for the Home Secretary have suggested that Al-Jedda has a real Iraqi passport and a valid grant of Iraqi nationality. This might allow her to further appeal the case. However his lawyers insist it is a fake one used to travel to Turkey in 2008.

A Home Office spokesman said:  ‘We are disappointed with the court’s decision. We are considering the  judgment and our next steps in this case carefully.’
