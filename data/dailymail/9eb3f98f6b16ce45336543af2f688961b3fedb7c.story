An outspoken French MP has branded his country's First Lady 'nothing more than the President's mistress' and told her to 'stop meddling' in the country's affairs.

Right-wing firebrand Bernard Debre issued the dramatic put-down to Valerie Trierweiler in his personal blog.

He wrote: 'Madame Trierweiler, self-proclaimed first Lady, is nothing more than the President's mistress.

'The president's mistress': An outspoken French MP has said Valerie Trierweiler, partner of President Fracois Hollande, should 'stop meddling' in the country's affairs'

'What is she meddling in? What right does she have to speak out?

'When one is in her position, after the blunders she has already made, it would be much better it she shut up.'

The 68-year-old MP for Paris also said her job as a journalist was 'incompatible' with her role as the President's partner.

He added: 'She might well want to get into politics, but she should stop being a journalist and define her position at the Elysee Palace.'

The 47-year-old divorcee has been the target of repeated media attacks since her boyfriend was elected president in May.

She was at the centre of accusations she tried to wreck the political career of Segolene Royal - the mother of Mr Hollande's four children - by tweeting her support for a candidate standing against her in the parliamentary elections.

Ms Royal lost the election and later said she had been 'stabbed in the back' by Mr Hollande's girlfriend.

The French leader's former partner of 28 years went on to accuse Mr Trierweiler of costing her a place in Mr Hollande's cabinet.

Ms Trierweiler also faced humiliation last month when her boss at the French magazine where she works said she would be sacked at the end of this year.

Glossy weekly Paris Match's owner Arnaud Lagardere described her as 'an unpinned grenade' who has caused him 'nothing but trouble' and said he would not be renewing her contract in January.

Mr Lagardere's comments were in a biogrpahy of the millionaire media tycoon by journalist Jacqueline Remy.

Ms Remy said it was suggested to Mr Lagardere in June that having the French First Lady as an employee would surely help him get 'the ear of the president'.

But he is quoted as replying: 'Are you kidding? Up until now, she's caused us nothing but problems.'

He went on: 'She's like an unpinned grenade.'

And Paris Match would be 'letting her go' next year to avaoid any 'conflict of interest', he said.

She is also demanding Â£70,000 in damages over a book claiming she cheated on her husband with TWO lovers at once.

Ms Trierweiler was the shared mistress of left-wing President Francois Hollande and a right-wing minister while she was married, the biography called The Troublemaker claimed.

And a separate book about Ms Trierweiler called Between Two Fires, by investigative journalist Anna Cabana describes her 'a cocktail of jealousy, vengeance and political calculation'.

And a third book about her called The Favorite by journalist

Laurent Greilsamer also writes: 'As I see it, you have shown yourself to be not normal, snooty, infatuated, explosive, unpredictable. And visibly dangerous.'
