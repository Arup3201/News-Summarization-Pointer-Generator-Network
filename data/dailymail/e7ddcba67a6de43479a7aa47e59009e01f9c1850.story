Fans of the country’s most popular light bulbs - the traditional 40 and 60-watt incandescent bulbs - are being encouraging to start stocking up as on January 1 it will become illegal for American businesses to either manufacture or import the old-style bulbs.

Possible alternatives to the old-style bulbs are halogen bulbs, compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL), LED bulbs and high efficiency incandescents - all are more energy efficient, but also more expensive.

‘Get them while you still can,’ Home Depot, the nation’s largest bulb retailer, is urging on its website. 'Stock up on incandescent light bulbs before they are completely discontinued.'

On January 1 it will become illegal for American businesses to either manufacture or import the old-style 40 and 60-watt light bulbs

The move is the result of a 2007 bill, signed by President George W. Bush, that set strict minimum efficiency standards.

Many old light bulbs were grossly inefficient with only 10 percent of the energy used converted into light, while the rest was wasted as heat, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The alternatives may be significantly more cost efficient int he long run, but that hasn’t stopped many Tea Party conservatives and Libertarians from voicing their unhappiness at the government trying to tell people which light bulbs they can use.

These critics argue that if the new bulbs really are so good, people will buy them on their own without being forced to do so.

Amongst the more energy efficient alternatives are compact fluorescent light bulbs, although they are more expensive too

The Republican-controlled House has already tried and failed to overturn the law. 

For fan of the old-style bulbs, Home Depot estimates that it has a six-month stockpile.

‘Home Depot anticipates running out of their stock of 40W to 60W bulbs six months into 2014,’ Mark Voykovic, the store’s national light bulb merchant, told FoxNews.

The retail giant said it has made 'a concerted effort' to educate employees and customers about the phaseout before then.

'In two years, you pay off that bulb,' 
said Voykovik. And because LED bulbs are expected to last at least 20 
years - it's all savings for the next 18 years.

The beginning of 2013 saw the phasing out of incandescent 75 and 100-watt light bulbs.

High efficiency incandescents cost about $1.50 each, compared to 50 cents or so for the old bulbs. But they last twice as long, and use 28 per cent less power.

With LEDs, the saving are even greater. While a 40-watt LED goes for about $7.50, it uses 85 per cent less energy than a traditional bulb.

Over the course of the year, a LED will consume about $2 in power under normal circumstances, compared to over $7 for an incandescent.
