In this day and age of Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest and so on, it seems digital photos are widely preferred to their physical counterparts.

But those who still pine for the day of physical photographs can get the best of both worlds, by turning their smartphone into a polaroid camera.

The Prynt Case attaches to a variety of phones and lets a user print images in 30 seconds - while augmented reality can also turn the printed pictures into videos.

A San Francisco-based company has revealed their Prynt device. It attaches to certain smartphones and lets users print physical photos. Users can print out screen-sized pictures in about 30 seconds (shown)

The device was developed by a team based in San Francisco, California, who are currently seeking funding on Kickstarter.

Costing around £65 ($99), the device will ship to backers in August of this year.

Instant camera film features layers of colours of light.

These layers sit on top of a black base layer and beneath an image, timing and acid layer.

When the shot is taken, a small amount of reagent material is rolled onto the film sheet, which reacts with chemicals in the film.

These chemicals move downward through the layers, dissolving the developer dye so it moves towards the image layer.

Metallic silver areas on each layer, which were exposed to light when the photo was taken, capture the dye so it is distributed throughout the photo, to match the colours of the scene photographed.

The acid layer in the film reacts with the alkali and opacifiers in the reagent, making the opacifiers become clear, and this is what makes the image appear.

The Prynt Case attaches to smartphones like an ordinary case, and to print images, users simply snap a picture and then press print, using an app for the device.

Perhaps one of its more intriguing features, though, is the ability to turn photos into augmented reality pictures.

Users can record a video using the Prynt app and then print it out as a photo.

When they scan the photo with their phone, they can then ‘play’ the photo as a video on the phone’s screen.

Prynt is compatible with the iPhone 5, 5S, 5C, 6 and Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5.

The device doesn’t use ink to print the photos, instead ‘embedding’ the photos into the paper, something known as 'instant film'. 

Each additional pack of ten sheets of paper to print photos on will cost £3.30 ($5).

The device also doesn’t require Bluetooth or WiFi, with instead the phone simply plugging in to the device.

And it has its own internal battery, so it does not need to draw power from your phone.

CEO Clément Perrot explained: ‘Most people have a smartphone with a camera, and social media lets us immediately share and "like" photographs, meaning images have more social value than ever.

‘Yet it’s the quantity rather than the quality of images that are valued. They have lost the deeper meaning that they had in past generations when photographs were precious, physical items that were used to share stories and memories.

‘Prynt hopes to bridge this gap by printing memories off from your phone, and bringing back the joy of holding an actual photograph in your hand.’

Sales of Polaroid cameras (pictured), which were particularly popular in the 1980s, have risen by around three quarters in the past year. The popularity of the retro camera has been attributed to people’s love of Instagram, as well as the number of celebrities embracing the devices, such as Lana Del Rey
