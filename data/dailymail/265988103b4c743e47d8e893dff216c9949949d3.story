An American Revolutionary War-era cannon on decorative display in Manhattan's Central Park has been discovered to be loaded with a cannon ball - and even primed with gunpowder - during a routine cleaning.

Park workers made the discovery Friday afternoon while refurbishing one of two cannons stored at Central Park's Ramble Shed, near the park's 79th Street entrance.

Fire!: The cannon found to still have a cannon ball and gun powder inside it was donated to the park around the time of the Civil War

Live ammo: The loaded artillery piece hasn't been on display since 1996, but was publicly accessible in Central Park for more than 100 years before that time

Origins: The Central Park cannon was once used on the British naval ship, HMS Hussar, circa 1763. The ship was used to carry dispatches and military payroll during the American Revolution

The two guns were reportedly donated at the time of the Civil War - but had not been on public display since 1996.

Still, the loaded cannon was reportedly accessible to the public for more than a 100 years before that time.

'It seems like some people are pretty incompetent not to notice after all these years,' an unidentified man told CBS New York.

Cops were quickly summoned to the scene, and removed the gun powder so as to render the cannon incapable of firing.

Ready to fire: An official gathers the actual gunpowder that still amazingly remained in the cannon after more than 200 years

Out of retirement: The cannon has been housed at the park's Ramble Shed, near its 79th St. entrance, but should soon make a reappearance on public display

'We silenced British cannon fire in 1776 and we don't want to hear it again in Central Park,' NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said.

The cannon originally came from a British Royal Navy Ship, the 28-gun HMS Hussar, which reportedly carried dispatches and military payroll during the American Revolution.

The ship eventually foundered off the coast of Long Island, and has been the subject of numerous salvage efforts.

The cannon had been long ago sealed with concrete, but when parks officials removed the concrete to conduct the cleaning, they made the dangerous discovery.
