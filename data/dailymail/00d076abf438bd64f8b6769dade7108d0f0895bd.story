A ballsy testicular cancer survivor is raising awareness of the disease  by pushing a 6-foot inflatable testicle across the United States.

Thomas Cantley, 31, believes his life was saved by early detection of the disease so he is on a mission to prevent the rest of the male population from letting testicular cancer go unnoticed.

He started his journey in Santa Monica on September 3 and is headed to New York with the giant flesh-colored ball, while explaining his mission to the people he meets and encouraging them to sign the inflatable testicle.

Thomas, who has earned the nickname Ballsy, was busy working as a filmmaker and photographer in New York when he noticed a gnawing pain in his groin and abdomen in 2009.

But he told Men's Health he ignored the warning signs until his left testicle swelled to the size of an orange and became excruciatingly painful. 

'I couldn't even put pants on,' he said. 'I was screaming.'

When Thomas finally went to the doctor he was diagnosed with Stage 3 testicular cancer, which had spread to his lymph nodes,

He was told that had the cancer been left  untreated, it would spread through his body and eventually to his brain and would have killed him.

Surgeons in his home town of Halifax, Nova Scotia, operated on Thomas to get the testicle and the infected lymph nodes removed.

Project Ball Push started in August in Canada as he trekked with Lefty to Vancouver, pushing the ball during the day and towing the ball with a donated car at night

'Cancer was my rebirth,' Thomas told the magazine. 'I need to be infectious . . . I need to create attention.

'It's my reincarnated left testicle,' he says of the giant ball. 'I call him Lefty.'

His project Ball Push started in August in Canada as he trekked with Lefty  to Vancouver, pushing the ball during the day and towing the ball with a donated car at night.

Now Thomas is taking on the United States, after creating a partnership with The Testicular Cancer Foundation, A+ reported.

Thomas accepts food, shelter, and gas, along with a promise to be proactive about  health issues

'There's not very many young men advocates, that are coming in with a little bit of an edge,' he told the magazine in an interview. 

'A lot of them are older. I kinda wanted to hit the demographic. I've been doing it for a couple years, but I realized I needed to get out there more.' 

He explained that he's raising awareness because he does not want other men to get to the point he was at, where it's almost too late. 

'When I was diagnosed, I didn't want to talk about it, I pushed everyone out of life,' he said.

Thomas has already covered 1,680 miles across America. The entire campaign is funded by the generosity of the people he meets along the way, whether they have a connection with cancer or simply believe in his cause

Thomas has already covered 1,680 miles across America. The entire campaign is funded by the generosity of the people he meets along the way, whether they have a personal connection with cancer or simply believe in his cause. 

He accepts food, shelter, or gas to get him to the next city, along with support and promise to be proactive about health issues.

But he wants to complete the project with the support of people alone and without accepting cash, as he believes this is a metaphor for how he survived his cancer.

'Money can only get you so far,' he said.

'It's the only option I have in my life,' he added, referring to his Ballsy nickname. 'Being ballsy is being proactive. Being Ballsy about your health.'
