It has been a busy fortnight for the mother-of-two who released her new album this week following a music break.

She was taken to hospital last night just hours after she was snapped in a dazzling outfit
 which was covered in black, red and white stars for an evening out at 
nightspot The Chiltern Firehouse in the capital.

Earlier in the day she had been interviewed on Alan Carr: Chatty Man as well attending ITV's Loose Women with her two young children in tow.

On Tuesday she attended Miley Cyrus' concert at the 02 in London.

Just
 24 hours prior to the concert the singer had been in New
 York attending the Met Gala in a Chanel dress with a host of A-list stars.

She even hit 
the afterparty and took 
several selfies with fellow stars including Kim Kardashian and Kanye 
West.

Despite
 not leaving the Met Gala party until late, Lily managed to make it
 back to London in time to catch twerking star Miley that
 evening.

And Lily made a swift costume change from Chanel to Fendi for the latter designer's party at Sothebys across the city.

Despite
 being the life and soul of the parties on Thursday, Lily had also been 
out on Wednesday evening at a Prada party - held at the suddenly 
star-studded capital venue the Firehouse Club.

And, beginning her run of partying, the star put on a much-discussed performance at the Shepherds Bush Empire on April 28.

But it seemed last night she fell ill and took to Twitter to reveal she couldn't stop being sick and had a temperature.

She wrote: 'I can't stop projectile vomiting,also temperature #poisoned (sic)'.

Evidently thirsty, she also shared a snap of several bottles of water on a side table, mysteriously captioning the image: '#SHEEHYDRATING #poisoned.'

Her fans tweeted 'get well soon' to Lily, with one well-wisher writing: 'Needless to say that I wish you well,  but the fact that you took this selfie makes me chuckle.  You're great! x @lilyallen.'

Another wrote: 'Hope you start to feel much better really soon honey ... nothing worse than being stuck in hospital. Need a rest after this!!'

Sunday March 30: The singer was spotted making her way to the Prada party at the Firehouse Club

Lily Allen is the latest in a long line of celebrities who have posted snaps from their hospital bed.

In January this year, Cara Delevingne tweeted a photo in which she was hooked up to an intravenous drip as she rested her arms on a spotty cushion.

Not giving too much away at first, the in-demand model wrote the simple caption: 'IV Drippin', which led to some of her fans to express their concern over her well-being.

Looking glum: Meanwhile, in March, singer Rita Ora shared an Instagram snap of herself hooked up to a drip, with the caption reading: 'Getting ready #musicvideotime #oooohhhhhhhyeaaaaaahhhhh'

One follower, carasmyworld wrote: 'What happened?? Babe are you okay?'

And kittysqueal33 commented: 'OMG! CARA!!!! WHAT HAPPENED?? LY BABE! STAY STRONG what happened?? Babe are you okay?' [sic].

Luckily, Cara took to Twitter soon afterwards to reassure everyone, writing: 'Don't worry! It's just a vitamin drip to help with a cold. Thanks for the messages.'

Meanwhile, in March, singer Rita Ora shared an Instagram snap of herself 
hooked up to a drip, with the caption reading: ‘Getting ready 
#musicvideotime #oooohhhhhhhyeaaaaaahhhhh’.

Ill: And last month, Miley Cyrus shared a photo of herself sporting a duck-face oxygen mask on Instagram

In
 the snap, Rita can be seen pouting glumly while sporting a black and 
white Opening Ceremony top, black leggings, a DKNY hat and a Moschino 
cow print backpack.

She 
may have been indulging in the celebrity trend of vitamin drips, which 
are believed to boost energy levels and give a youthful glow.

And last month, Miley Cyrus shared a photo of herself sporting a duck-face oxygen mask on Instagram, writing, 'This hospitals full of a bunch of QUACKS (get it??? Quacks) #punnyeveninthehospy #stayinglightlovingandpositive #imissbangerztour #tryingtonotbebitter.'

Hospitalised: Another celebrity to have posted a
 photo from hospital is Rihanna (right), who tweeted a photo (left) of 
her arm hooked up to an IV drip after the New York Metropolitan Museum 
of Art’s Met Ball in 2012

The 21-year-old singer was reportedly hospitalised with breathing difficulties after suffering an allergic reaction to an antibiotic she took after contracting the flu.

She was forced to postpone the rest of her Bangerz Tour because of her condition - but will resume the U.S. tour in August.

Another celebrity to have posted a photo from their hospital bed is Rihanna, who tweeted a photo of her arm hooked up to an IV drip just hours after the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Met Ball in 2012.
