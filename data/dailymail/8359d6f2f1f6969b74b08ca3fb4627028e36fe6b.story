There was fury across Greece today after it was announced that a journalist who published the names of more than 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts is to stand trial again.

Costas Vaxevanis has been told that his acquital earlier this month for breaking data privacy laws after publishing the so-called ‘Lagarde List’ was 'faulty.'

The Athens Public Prosecutor’s office said that Mr Vaxevanis must now be tried again by a higher court on the same charges.

If found guilty, Vaxevanis could be jailed for up to two years or face a fine. ‘The prosecutor believes that the decision in favour of the journalist is legally wrong,’ a court official said.

The speedy arrest, trial and acquittal of Mr Vaxevanis for publishing the so-called 'Lagarde List' had aroused international concern and captivated recession-weary Greeks angry at the privileges of the elite.

Names: The list has been dubbed the 'Lagarde List' after Christine Lagarde (above), head of the IMF, who was the French finance minister when it was passed to Greek authorities

Given to Greece by French authorities in 2010, the list contains the names of 2,059 Greek account holders at HSBC in Switzerland to be probed for possible tax evasion.

The list was named after Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund who was the French finance minister when the list was handed over.

The list and the saga of how it was passed from one senior official to the next and misplaced at one point without anyone apparently taking action, has riveted Greeks.

In his defence, Mr Vaxevanis accused politicians of hiding the truth and protecting an 'untouchable' elite. He said the trial was politically motivated, calling it 'targetted and vengeful.'

Greece has so far failed to convict any big names for tax evasion, fuelling popular disenchantment with a political class that promised to force the wealthy to share some of the pain of the debt crisis.

Mr Vaxevanis has said an anonymous source gave him a copy of the Lagarde List because ministers had done nothing with it.

Mr 
Vaxevanis’s supporters included the Greek daily newspaper Ta Nea, which 
also published the list over 11 news pages. It made clear there was no 
evidence that any of those named had broken tax evasion laws.
