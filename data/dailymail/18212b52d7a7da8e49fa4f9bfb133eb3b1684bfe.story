A decision to crack down on parents taking their children on holiday during term time by Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove is being challenged in the courts

Michael Gove's decision to crack down on parents taking children on holiday in term time is being challenged in the courts by a group of parents.

The action to take the Education Secretary's ruling to judicial review is being backed by a petition signed by more than 200,000 parents.

The group claims the rules are a breach of their human right to a family life.

Parents Want A Say is being launched 
today and co-ordinated by Karen Wilkinson, a mother-of-three from Bath 
in Somerset, reports the Sunday Times.

Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who has successfully campaigned to open up the family courts, is advising the group.

Ms
 Wilkinson says it's not just parents looking for cheap holidays who are
 being refused permission to take children out of school under the new 
stricter rules.

'Requests 
to take children out of school for weddings, to visit elderly 
grandparents who live abroad or even in some cases, when doctors have 
sanctioned the request because it's in the child's interest, are all 
being turned down,' she said.

This weekend it emerged that a ten-year-old girl from Tamworth was denied a day off for her grandfather's funeral.

Mr
 Gove's changes brought in last year end the right for schools to grant 
up to 10 days holiday per year in special circumstances.

Parents face fine of £60 per pupil 
per parent if they take children out of school without permission and 
those who refuse to pay could be fined £2,500 by the courts and even 
jailed for up to three months.

More
 than 24,000 children are skipping school every day to go on family 
holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak-time price
 hikes.

Official figures
 reveal a sharp drop in the number of schools giving permission for 
term-time holidays following a crackdown by Mr Gove.

But
 growing numbers of parents are taking children on 'unauthorised' family
 breaks, despite the threat of £120 fines and even court action.

So-called 'middle-class truancy' is 
linked to inflated prices imposed by travel companies during half-term, 
Christmas, Easter and summer school holidays.

Provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term

Prices can be double normal rates and savings on the holidays often outweigh the cost of any fines.

Mr Gove tightened the rules from last September to prevent unnecessary disruption to children's education.

Heads were previously able to grant up to ten days holiday a year.

But changes to the regulations remove references to the ten-day threshold and make clear heads 'may not grant any leave of absence during term-time unless there are exceptional circumstances', such as a family bereavement.

Provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term last year despite the crackdown.

About three-quarters of these had been taken out of school without the permission of the head.Parents who fail to gain the consent of the head teacher risk truancy fines of £120 – or £60 if paid within 28 days.

The true figures for pupils missing lessons could be higher since the Department for Education realised some schools had not been counted.
