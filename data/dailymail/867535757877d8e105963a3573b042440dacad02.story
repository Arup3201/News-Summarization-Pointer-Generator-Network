What could be the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of Mexico's ancient civilisations has been discovered.

Archaeologists working at the site near to Mexico City have so far unearthed 150 skulls with just one or two vertaebrae attached - suggesting they were hacked off the victims.

Dated to between 600 and 850AD, the skulls were found in an area miles from the nearest large city of the day, and researchers say the discovery could challenge existing notions about the area's ancient culture.

'It's absolutely remarkable to think about this little nothing on the landscape having potentially evidence of the largest mass human sacrifice in ancient Meso-America,' said Christopher Morehart of Georgia State University.

He is co-author a study detailing the findings published this month in the journal Latin American Antiquity.

Dr Morehart, an archaeologist at Georgia's anthropology department, and colleagues stumbled across the site while using Google Earth to investigate ancient waterworks surrounding the ancient kingdom of Teotihuacan.

That mysterious city, home to the famous Pyramid of the Sun, flourished from 200 to 650AD but, to date, the civilisation that built it remains unknown.

It was in the now-drained Lake Xaltocan, which was at the time surrounded by nothing more than rural farmland, that Dr Morehart discovered a site which showed evidence of looting, LiveScience reported.

Closer investigation revealed the skulls, as well as a shrine with water-deity statues, incense burners and agricultural pottery like corncob depictions, which researchers said suggested a ritual purpose tied to farming.

Dr Morehart told LiveScience that carbon dating of the skulls suggested they were at least 1,100 years old. Most were from men.

The find is similar, but much earlier than, the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City reported in October last year.

But while the provenance of that burial site was quickly ascertained, there is no clue as to how assembled the Lake Xaltocan cache of skulls.

The team chose not to release photos of these latest skulls because the sacrificial victims may be historically tied to indigenous people still living in the area.

Destiny Crider, an archaeologist with Luther College in Iowa who was not part of the research team said that the findings could lead to a revision of historical accounts of the region.

The site is not associated with Teotihuacan or other regional powers, she told LiveScience, and its location is unlike the great pyramids within cities where such sacrifices usually took place.

She also suggested that the shrine and the fact that most of the victims were male suggest they were carefully chosen and not simply the result of indiscriminate slaughter of locals.

Many researchers believe the kingdom of Teotihuacan fell as a result of a disastrous drought, and there followed a period of warfare as smaller regional powers competed for supremacy.

Dr Crider suggested the political instability could have spurred merciless innovation in the region's bloody sacrifice rituals.

'Maybe they needed to intensify their activities because everything was changing,' she told LiveScience. 'When things are uncertain you try new strategies.'
