All eyes were on Lionel Messi, and here is his heat map

It was only 65 minutes in, but it had seemed an age. Nothing was going right. Free-kicks flew wastefully into orbit; darting runs were extinguished almost at inception; passes were snuffled up by the blue meanies of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The Maracana stadium, an Argentinian enclave in Rio de Janeiro for the night, yearned for their little master to assume his rightful place as the true star of this World Cup, but it was not his night.

Lionel Messi had only scored one World Cup goal in his career, the same as Matthew Upson, and that was eight years ago. In match time, 623 minutes had expired since he last struck for Argentina on this stage.

Ratings by MARTIN SAMUEL in the Maracana

And then it happened. Oh, it was 
lovely. Not just the move but the possibilities offered for this 
tournament. Messi with a monkey on his back is no Messi at all. Messi, 
liberated from pressure by a goal in his opening game, may now elevate 
this World Cup to a higher plane.

It
 was a beautiful passing advance, triangles working their way through 
the deep Bosnian midfield, before the ball found Messi, as it so often 
does for that is his genius, and he played an neat one-two with 
substitute Gonzalo Higuain.

Receiving the ball once more he ran from 
right to left with such nimble feet that two Bosnian guards, Ermin 
Bicakcic and Muhamed Besic, collided in his wake.

Now with clear sight 
of goal, he checked the position of goalkeeper Asmir Begovic and finished
 perfectly, the ball coming off the inside of a post, so exceptionally 
was it judged.

And that is 
what the greats do. Until then, it wasn’t his game. And then he made it 
so. Until then, Bosnia looked more than capable of earning a point – an 
85th minute goal by Vedad Ibisevic confirmed the threat – and then it 
was out of their reach. Messi had made it his night after all.

From 
here, the tournament begins – particularly if Cristiano Ronaldo decides 
to match him for Portugal on Monday, as he so often does when similarly 
challenged in Spain.

Messi 
was announced as man of the match at the end, a FIFA award he will 
recognise as nonsense. If anything, the best players were the half-time 
substitutes Fernando Gago and Higuain, whose introduction changed 
Argentina’s formation and the course of the game.

Until then, the team 
considered by many to be the finest at the tournament had laboured with
 three at the back. Despite going a goal behind after three minutes, 
Bosnia were having the best of the game.

Horrendous start: Bosnia defender Sead Kolasin (No 5) is rooted to the spot after scoring an own goal

Rabona in his own box! Argentina defender Marcos Rojo elaborately clears the ball under pressure

Alejandro Sabella, Argentina’s 
manager, confessed his mistake by removing the anonymous Maxi Rodriguez 
and a defender, Hugo Campagnaro at half-time and switching to a back 
four. Gago, an impressive midfielder with Boca Juniors and one of the 
few members of this squad to have played outside Europe, freed up Messi and 
Angel Di Maria and Argentina thrived.

What has been all too clear so far
 is that commercial profiles place the biggest players under almost 
intolerable pressure at modern World Cups. It was the humble Gago’s 
involvement that helped Messi rise above this. We should all be very 
grateful.

If there was a 
fault in Messi’s game early on – and this is not a sentiment that will 
be aired regularly – it was that he almost tried to play the occasion 
rather than the match.

This was Messi in the Maracana – the world’s most
 famous footballer in the world’s most famous football stadium. It was 
an event that demanded brilliance, splendour, excitement to bursting 
point, and that was what Messi attempted desperately to deliver.

Unfortunately, it is not just well-meaning amateurs and Wayne Rooney 
that can lose their way by trying too hard, and Messi fell victim to a 
very human flaw. He wanted it too much – the stage, the moment, the roar
 that would greet one of those scuttling, scintillating runs, when the 
ball appears to be tied to his foot by a strand of elastic and defenders
 circle like so many crazed ants whose nest has been disturbed by the 
sole of a sandal.

Flying out: Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero punches the ball away from Izet Hajrovic

Messi 
reached for fabulousness time and again, but without luck or joy. 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have been well drilled by coach Safet Susic and 
whenever Messi got possession he was immediately detailed by two, 
sometimes three, blue shirts, obstructing his path, snapping at his 
heels, as eager to destroy as he was to create.

Not that Bosnia played a
 negative game, far from it. They were just not so daft that Messi was 
allowed to dominate the way his sponsors would have wished – the way his
 life is portrayed in commercial breaks when impossible is nothing and 
wizardry is real.

What was 
real in the Maracana was an opposition that had not fought its way to 
Brazil to be anybody’s support act on their debut. Bosnia-Herzegovina 
are the fifth of the former Yugoslav states to make it to a World Cup
 – if one includes Montenegro as part of Serbia in 1998 and 2006 – and 
the pride of the team and its fans was obvious.

They suffered the most 
horrid start, but recovered, and those who feared they might be 
embarrassed here were quickly dissuaded of such negativity. A lesser 
team could have gone under after the bad luck that befell them three 
minutes in, but they regrouped and came at Argentina with impressive 
ambition.

First the bad 
news. Argentina won a free-kick 40 yards out to the left of goal, which 
Messi whipped in dangerously. Giant full back Marcos Rojo rose and 
headed it on, striking Sead Kolasinac on the boot for an unknowing 
diversion past goalkeeper Begovic.

It could easily have been a prelude 
to a humbling World Cup debut, but Bosnia are made of stronger stuff. 
From there, Sergio Romero in Argentina’s goal, received a thorough 
workout.

Miralem Pjanic of 
Roma was pulling the strings in the centre of midfield and it was his 
ball in the 14th minute that showed Bosnia were in no mood to accept 
defeat.

It dropped over Argentina’s high line defence and was gobbled up
 by midfielder Izet Hajrovic. Fortunately for Argentina, Romero was 
alive to the threat and he dashed from his line to save.

Pjanic’s
 set-pieces were proving as dangerous as his passes, and four minutes 
before half-time he picked out Senad Lulic with a fine inswinging 
corner, the resulting header forcing another excellent save from Romero.

Ibisevic’s late goal was no more than they deserved, even though Romero
 was weak for it. Perhaps it was for the best. Bosnia can build from 
here, and look potential qualifiers, Messi is free to take his 
sun-blessed talents deeper into the tournament.

He may return here on 
July 13. Who knows what marvels we might have witnessed by then?
