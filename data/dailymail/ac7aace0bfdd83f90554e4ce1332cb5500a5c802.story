Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone hailed 'extraordinary' Juan Roman Riquelme following the Argentina playmaker's retirement from football.

The 36-year-old enjoyed a successful career in South America and Europe, collecting numerous trophies and individual awards while playing for clubs including Barcelona, Villarreal and Boca Juniors before finishing his career at Argentinos Juniors.

Simeone, who played with Riquelme for the Argentina national team, reflected on his team-mate's career as a supporter rather than a fellow professional by saying: 'Riquelme, I wish him well.

'He gave a lot to football, he built an extraordinary career. As a fan, I thank you for all the nights you gave us.'
