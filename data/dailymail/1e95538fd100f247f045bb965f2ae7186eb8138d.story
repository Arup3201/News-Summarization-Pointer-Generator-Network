Tony Adams says Arsenal will not challenge for the Premier League title next season and will finish no higher than fourth.

The former Gunners captain believes Arsene Wenger's side will not be able to compete with Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United - who he is tipping to bounce back after last season's seventh-place finish.

Despite Arsenal winning the FA Cup last season - their first major trophy for nine years - Adams believes their expansive football will ultimately see them fall short against their title rivals. Arsenal last won the Premier League in 2004.Â

'The club came under criticism for not winning a trophy and I was one of them! It was important for them to win that,' Adams told Express Sport.

'Hopefully it will be a pivotal moment in the careers of the squad members and they can go on and win league titles.

'However I don't think they will win the title as Chelsea and Manchester City are blowing the league apart and Man Utd will come again.

'I don't think Arsenal will finish any higher than 4th at the moment which is a little bit sad, but they needed to win the FA Cup because they had stick from the fans.

'They played some remarkable football at times last season, but they they do leave themselves open.

'When they come up against big teams they tend to leave themselves too open because they want to play freely and roll teams over.'
