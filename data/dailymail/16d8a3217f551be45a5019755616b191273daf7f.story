She's Chelsea's resident fashionista who spearheaded the fedora hat trend and dishes out daily style advice, so it was only a matter of time before Rosie Fortescue channelled her expertise into her own collection.

The long-standing Made In Chelsea star has curated and modelled her debut clothing collection with Lipstick Boutique - and every single piece stays true to the tailored and chic style she's made her own.

Speaking to MailOnline about the new collection, the TV star and fashion blogger said: 'This project is really exciting for me because I love fashion and I've had a lot of involvement in the whole process, from designing to styling.'

It's here! Rosie Fortescue is well known for her style knowledge in Made In Chelsea and now she's channelled it into her debut fashion collection (skirt, £40)

While most of her co-stars are already on their second or third ranges, Rosie admits she wanted to wait for the 'right opportunity' to come along.

'I've had lots of offers but this one just felt right, I have been waiting for the right time and this was the perfect fit,' she said.

The time is right: Rosie explained that she's had a lot of opportunities to design a range but wanted to wait for the perfect opportunity, which she found with Lipstick Boutique (left: dress, £75, right: top, £50)

Style staples: Rosie believes that leather trousers and cosy knits are essential for winter - and thinks Cara Delevingne would look great in her designs (trousers, £50)

Style advisor: Many of the cast members on MIC come to Rosie for fashion advice and she and Millie Mackintosh have been exchanging style notes during the launch of their collections 

Describing the new collection, which is packed with oh-so-now tailored pieces, midi skirts and cosy capes, the 24-year-old said: 'It's fashion-forward and super wearable. 

'It's inspired by my own style and I've taken anecdotes from my clothes, so lots of tailored pieces mixed up with feminine looks - there's something for everyone.'

Rosie has worked in super girly skirts with cool prints, tuxedo dress, which she says are super flattering, and chunky knits that she says Cara Delevingne would look 'amazing' in.

Trendy: Rosie loves tailored pieces and thinks this £65 structured piece is super flattering 

Citing her icons as Olivia Palermo and Abbey Clancy, Rosie reveals that her best friend and fellow fashion designer Millie Mackintosh had a glance through her look book before it launched and the pair exchanged notes. 'We have been wearing each others ranges,' she added.

Rosie is one of the original Made In Chelsea cast members and as well as seeing her star rise, she says her style has changed, too.

'I have learnt a lot about my body and what suits my shape. For example, I am pale so I would never wear neon.'

She's extremely grateful to the E4 show for providing her with so many opportunities, explaining: 'It's full of drama and fun and we had an amazing time in New York. I am so proud and pleased that it's all going so well.'

Something for everyone: Rosie says she has spent a long time considering what her customers would want and has included dressier pieces for nights out, left, £35, and more casual daytime pieces, right, £80

Fashionable face: Rosie says her style has changed since joining Made In Chelsea and she's learnt what works for her. She is now a regular at fashion events such as last night's Burberry event, right
