Pakistan's top-order batsmen continued their superb form in the United Arab Emirates as they reached 269 for one on day one of the first Test against New Zealand.

Following a 2-0 series win over Australia in which Younus Khan averaged 156, Misbah-ul-Haq hit Test cricket's joint-fastest century and Sarfraz Ahmed, Azhar Ali and Ahmed Shehzad also made hundreds, Misbah's side picked up where they left off on their adopted home territory in Abu Dhabi.

Mohammad Hafeez joined in with 96 in an opening stand of 178 with Shehzad, who went on to 126 not out and found further strong support from Azhar with 46no.

Misbah won the toss and chose to bat and Hafeez clipped the third ball of the day for four - and when Shehzad did likewise from the eighth, the 'hosts' were quickly into a familiar routine.

Spin had been successful in the Australia series and New Zealand introduced Mark Craig and Ish Sodhi in the 10th and 11th overs.

The scoring rate was slow but Pakistan were unruffled, reaching 31 without loss in 15 almost chanceless overs, but BJ Watling then missed the opportunity to stump Shehzad on 16.

The batsman punished him with a boundary to bring up Pakistan's half-century and then struck back-to-back fours off Corey Anderson.

It was 85 for no wicket at lunch and Hafeez moved past 50 soon after the restart, pulling Tim Southee for his fourth four in 91 balls.

He then steered three off Trent Boult to take his side to three figures before Shehzad followed him to 50 from 148 deliveries, with five fours.

Four fours in two overs from the spinners signalled an acceleration, 50 runs coming in the hour after lunch.

A Shehzad boundary brought up the 150 but as Hafeez neared three figures, he was deceived by Anderson's slower ball and popped up a return catch. After the boundary to take him to 51, he had added another 45 runs in 46 balls.

Shehzad was on 89 at tea in a total of 194 for one and though he was almost bowled by Sodhi as he inside-edged for four, his third Test century came up from 221 balls with 12 boundaries.

Captain Brendon McCullum's occasional medium pace yielded some reverse swing but no wickets, though Craig almost had Azhar when Watling brilliantly anticipated a reverse sweep but could not hang on.

Southee and Boult could make no headway with the new ball, with the second-wicket stand nearing three figures by the close.
