They've all hit memorable shots at the climax to the Race to Dubai, but could any of them match - or even better - each other in a unique challenge on the Earth Course?

That was the task for Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson earlier this week when the trio warmed-up for the DP World Tour Championship by trying to recreate each other's famous shots on the 18th hole at the tournament.

Stenson's effort - a stunning three wood approach to the green which won the European Tour's Shot of the Year award in 2013 - was first up for McIlroy and Rose.

The pair couldn't quite manage to get it as close as the Swede, who tapped in for eagle to win both the Race to Dubai and the event itself at Jumeirah Golf Estates a year ago.

McIlroy, who has already sealed victory in this year's Race to Dubai, came out on top though, with his attempt rolling to within a few feet of the pin.

Next up was Rose's ridiculous putt from 2012, which seemed to take an eternity to trickle down one tier and end up agonisingly close to dropping straight in.

Neither Stenson or world No 1 McIlroy could read it as well as the Englishman, who finished second two years ago, with both of their efforts finishing left and beyond the hole.

Rose also had another go himself and almost went one better than 2012 when his putt hit the pin but failed to fall.

Last up was McIlroy, whose birdie putt from 10-feet on the last hole two years ago helped give him victory in the Dubai showpiece.

The 25-year-old proved it was no fluke by holing an identical putt before Rose stepped up to produce the same result.

But Stenson saved the best until last, gripping his club with just one hand and hooking his left leg around it before putting out in style.
