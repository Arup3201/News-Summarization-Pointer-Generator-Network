'Genius': Poet and writer Seamus Heaney has died aged 74 in Dublin, it emerged today

His fans adored him, especially women. The most devoted, who followed him round the circuit of literary festivals, were dubbed the ‘Heaney-Boppers’.

And with his majestic voice, and the twinkle in his slanting eyes – one friend joked that he looked like a drunken Eskimo – Seamus Heaney was a man who exuded kindness and warmth.

But the Nobel Prize-winning poet, who died yesterday aged 74 after a short illness, had a tougher side too. He fought harder than anyone to reverse the decline in how we speak and write English.

In an era of text-speak and Americanisms, when schools were busily scrapping rules on grammar, spelling and vocabulary, Heaney taught people to love English by encouraging them to learn its poetry by heart.

With Ted Hughes, the future Poet Laureate, he compiled a glorious collection, The Rattle Bag, which since it appeared in 1982 has become the best-loved schoolbook in Britain.

His ambition was to collect a panorama of poems that could easily be committed to memory into a single volume. He and Hughes had an infallible instinct for lines that, once read, would never be forgotten. When Education Secretary Michael Gove was widely criticised for saying children should learn poetry by rote, Heaney leapt to his defence.

‘I believe in people learning poetry by heart – definitely,’ Heaney said. ‘Most poets have chunks of poetry memorised.’

'A gift to the world': Former U.S. president 
Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, the former secretary of state, said 
they were saddened to learn of the death of a 'friend' they described as
'a true son of Northern Ireland'

Heaney, a Catholic, was born on the 
family farm in Londonderry in 1939. At 12 he won a scholarship to St 
Columb’s College, a Roman Catholic boarding school, where budding 
politician John Hume was also a pupil. Both men would go on to win a 
Nobel Prize; Heaney got his for literature in 1995.

While
at St Columb’s, tragedy struck when Heaney’s younger brother, 
Christopher, was knocked down by a car and killed. Ten years later, in a
1966 collection of his poems, Death Of A Naturalist, Heaney remembered 
seeing the four-year-old boy’s little body in its coffin: ‘Wearing a 
poppy bruise on the left temple/ He lay in the four foot box as in a 
cot... A four foot box, a foot for every year.’

The
image is stark and the language is simple. Heaney prided himself on 
plain poetry that was never pretentious. That didn’t always impress his 
contemporaries, who were writing wild streams of consciousness and 
hallucinatory blank verse. Heaney was ‘far from unfathomable,’ said one 
critic tartly, as if being unfathomable were a virtue.

But
Heaney ignored the critics, continuing to write in his own clear, 
rational style. ‘In the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties,’ he admitted, 
‘there was a notion that order and discipline meant you were a dictator 
in the making and certainly you were supporting [the war in] Vietnam.’ 
In fact, said Heaney, ‘Formal verse is easier. It’s freedom.’

Much loved: Heaney's work made him world famous but it was his sense of humour that also won him a great deal of affection

He
believed in the power of poetry to change the world. ‘When there’s a 
crisis like 9/11, a bomb or something like that, there is a wish for a 
language that will help, not comprehension but acceptance or standing up
to it.’

Though Heaney 
fiercely loved the English language and its history, he didn’t take 
kindly to being called an Englishman. He refused the offer to become 
Poet Laureate after Hughes died, and responded in furious verse when his
work was included in an anthology of British poets.

‘Be
advised, my passport’s green/ No glass of ours was ever raised/ To 
toast the Queen,’ he warned, before signing off, ‘British, no, the 
name’s not right./ Yours truly, Seamus.’

He wrote elegies for friends killed in the Troubles but refused to condone the violence, and kept his distance from politics.

Life: Heaney was born in April 1939, the eldest of nine children, and went on to forge a fantastic writing career, pictured right reading a poem at an event in June

'Between my finger and my thumb, The squat pen rests; snug as a gun' - from his poem Digging.

'Wearing a poppy bruise on the left temple, He lay in the four foot box 
as in a cot. No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear. A four foot 
box, a foot for every year' - from his poem Mid-term Break.

'When History says, don't hope, On this side of the grave. But then, once in a lifetime The longed-for tidal wave Of justice can rise up, And hope and history rhyme' - from the play The Cure At Troy and quoted by then US president Bill Clinton in a speech about the Northern Ireland peace process delivered in Londonderry in 1995.

'It's like being a little foothill at the bottom of a mountain range, you hope you just live up to it' - Heaney on receiving the Nobel Prize and being regarded as the equal of WB Yeats

'It was like opening the back door of our own house, looking out on the fields' - Heaney on the influence of reading his fellow poet, Patrick Kavanagh.

'The life of poetry at its most vital is a life of fear I think and panic that it will leave' - Heaney describing his worry that his poetic inspiration might run out.

He
once said he had ‘an early warning system telling me to get back inside
my own head’ whenever politics was discussed. Though he left the 
countryside and taught English first in Belfast and then in Dublin as a 
young man, he did not forget his farming roots.

He
fondly remembered watching his grandfather cutting turf for peat, and 
taking a bottle of milk to the old man who would straighten up just long
enough to drink it before bending over his spade again. He pictured 
himself working in the same way, digging out words with the nib of his 
pen.

Unfortunately for his besotted female fans, he was – almost uniquely among poets – a happily married family man.

He
had two sons and a daughter with his wife Marie. He and Marie met in 
1962, and they fell in love during evenings spent with Ted Hughes and 
his then lover Assia Wevill, drinking ‘poteen’ – home-brewed potato 
whiskey – and reciting poems, while Marie sang folk songs.

Unlike
many literary men, Heaney did not enjoy feuds. He was amiable and quick
to give praise, which won him friends. Even the notoriously grumpy 
Hughes was happy to work with him. When Hughes died, Heaney gave the 
eulogy at Westminster Abbey and said that no death outside his own 
family had grieved him so deeply.

But there was one notable enmity. Heaney disliked the downbeat poetry of Philip Larkin.

A
poet’s job, said Heaney, was to lift up a lyre, or harp, and play music
to the gods. Larkin’s work, he implied, was more like someone drumming 
on a kitchen sink.

He 
continued to win over fans until the end of his life. At one recent 
reading, a young student was heard lamenting, ‘I love Seamus Heaney! I 
just want him to give me a hug!’

With
his passion for poetry and his genius for selecting verses we all could
learn easily by heart, Heaney gave us much more than the promise of a 
hug. He restored our love of the English language.
