One of Royal Caribbean’s employees has been indicted on charges of raping a 14-year-old girl while she was on vacation with her family.

Fabian Palmer, 25, works as a pool attendant for the cruise line, and is accused of luring the girl into a men’s locker room and having sex with her.

The alleged attack is the latest in a string of sex assaults on young girls traveling with their families on cruise ships.

Scandal on the high seas: Fabian Palmer, 25, a Royal Caribbean employee, admitted to having sex with a 14-year-old girl on a cruise

Not all the details: Palmer told Royal Caribbean workers that he thought the girl was 16

The police report says Palmer first befriended the 
girl and her family before allegedly raping her and only stopping when 
another employee knocked on the locker room door.

Video footage captured ‘the likeness of Palmer,’ as well as the victim and a second employee outside of the locker room around the time the attack occurred, according to a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court.

The family left for vacation from Royal Caribbean’s port of departure in Baltimore, Maryland on December 17 aboard the Adventure of the Seas.

Luxury liner: The girl was allegedly raped on the Adventure of the Seas, a 15-deck cruise ship

The alleged rape of the 14-year-old 
girl by Fabien Palmer is the fourth sexual assault on a minor onboard a 
luxury cruise liner in recent months:

Incident One

Alabama
 man Dylan Cole Bloodsworth, 19, was sentenced to ten years in prison 
for raping a 13-year-old girl on-board a Carnival cruise ship in Mexico,
 where she was vacationing with her family. The pair met on March 6, and
 he allegedly raped her when he lured her to his cabin to grab a jacket.
 He called the girl on his cell phone after midnight and threatened her 
life if she didn't oblige him.

Incident Two

A
 35-year-old waiter named Kert Clyde Jordan is charged with raping a 
14-year-old girl on a Carnival Cruise on November 4 and 5. There is 
little that can be done in the court, however, as there is no federal law for statutory rape on the high seas.

Incident Three

A
 15-year-old girl was reportedly lured from a teen nightclub on the 
Royal Caribbean ship and raped by two cruise employees- Luiz Scavone, 
20, and a 15-year-old male- during her family’s Christmas cruise around 
the Caribbean. Both suspects, Brazilian nationals, were arrested when 
the ship returned to Port Everglades, Florida last week.

Two days before Christmas, the victim came forward to tell authorities of the attack. 

She told them that she encountered Palmer on the deck while she was alone.

The victim says he then took her inside a men’s locker room and began to have sex with her.

He was stopped when another employee knocked on the door, the records state.

After being interviewed by Royal 
Caribbean staff, Palmer admitted to having sex with the girl, but said 
he thought she was 16, not 14, records show. Royal Caribbean mentions 
the indictment on its blog.

According to his Facebook profile, Palmer was born in Jamaica and lives in Malaga, Spain.

He was indicted on a single count of sex abuse of a minor on January 11, the Baltimore Sun reports.

This is the latest in a string of alleged rapes on cruise liners.

A 15-year-old girl was reportedly lured from a teen nightclub on the Royal Caribbean ship and raped by two men during her family’s Christmas cruise around the Caribbean.

Luiz Scavone, 20, and a 15-year-old male are accused of luring the girl from a teen nightclub on the ship to a private room where the incident is said to have occurred.

Both suspects, Brazilian nationals, were arrested when the ship returned to Port Everglades, Florida last week.

There is no federal law for statutory rape on the high seas.

Another 14-year-old girl was reportedly raped on a Carnival cruise in November by a 35-year-old man working as a waiter on the ship.

Royal Caribbean did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Thirty-five-year-old Kert Clyde Jordan, from Grenada, who worked as a waiter on the Miami-based Carnival Liberty, was charged with engaging in a sexual act with a person under the age of 16.

A statement from the United States Attorney’s Office claimed Jordan engaged in sexual acts with the girl while the ship was in international waters on November 4 and 5.

And only ten days prior, 19-year-old Dylan Cole Bloodsworth, from Alabama, was sentenced to ten years in prison for raping a 13-year-old girl on-board a Carnival cruise ship in Mexico, where she was vacationing with her family. Though the event took place in March, Bloodsworth plead guilty to the event in November.

Reported: The girl told authorities about the alleged rape that took place two days before Christmas
