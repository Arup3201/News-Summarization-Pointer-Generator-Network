Beyoncé bares all as she poses naked in her new documentary - just three weeks before giving birth to daughter Blue Ivy.

Gently cradling her stomach, Beyoncé casts off any doubt that she faked her pregnancy as she recalls her fear of giving birth.

Speaking at the premiere of her revealing HBO documentary, Life Is But a Dream - the title of which is taken from baby Blue's favourite song, Row, Row, Row Your Boat - Beyoncé said she hoped the film would provide inspiration for her little girl, who is given a starring role in the film.

As she details a miscarriage and a fallout with her father, the 31-year-old singer said: 'I hope that she will see all of the beautiful times and all the tough times that led up to her being here. I’m hoping that … it can comfort her and inspire her in her life when she needs it.'

The documentary even features footage taken from the hospital room as Beyoncé prepares to give birth, with the singer and her husband megastar rapper Jay-Z beaming with joy as her mother Tina Knowles calmly sets her daughter's hair in rollers.

The star speaks out about her daughter in the March issue of Vogue, saying: 'She is my road dog, my homey, my best friend. I feel like I have something that has grounded me so much more.'

And Blue makes a starring appearance in the documentary, which will air on Sunday at 9pm, as her mother cuddles her and shows her off to the camera.

Beyoncé dismisses the rumors that she used a surrogate to have her daughter - who she reveals was unplanned - as 'the most ridiculous rumor I’ve ever had about me.'

She adds that although she realises there are 'crazy celebrities' who do outlandish things for attention -  she would never make light of having a child, adding: 'I respect mothers and women so much and to be able to experience bringing a child into the world – if you’re lucky and fortunate enough to experience that – I would never take that for granted.'

She continues that having a miscarriage makes the topic even touchier, 'Especially after losing a child, the pain and trauma from that just makes it mean so much more to get an opportunity to bring a life into the world.

'It’s something you have to respect. There’s certain things you just shouldn’t play around with and a child, you don’t play around with that.'

For the star, music was her salvation after suffering a miscarriage two years ago. She is heard singing 'the saddest song I've ever written', with the lyrics revealing: 'I guess love just wasn’t 
enough for us to survive. I swear I swear I swear I tried. You took the 
life right out of me. I’m so unlucky I can’t breathe. You took the life 
right out of me. I’m longing for your heartbeat, heartbeat.'

The autobiographical film takes a no-holds-barred look at Beyoncé using footage the star filmed on the video camera on her computer over the past three years. It also includes home movies of the Grammy-winning singer as a child with sister Solange  - and her Destiny's Child bandmates as teenagers.

Speaking to Oprah Winfrey before the screening, she said: 'I really grew so much. This movie has really been my therapy. I’ve healed from so many wounds and I’ve been able to understand why some of the things I’ve been through, why I went through, so I feel really proud, and hopefully I can inspire other people.'

'I felt that after 16 years of being a public singer, people didn’t know who I was,' although she added: 'I will always keep certain things to myself because it’s only natural.'

During the fascinating documentary, Beyoncé talks about firing her father Matthew Knowles as her manager in 2011.

Matthew had been in charge of Destiny's Child  - and helped launch Beyoncé's solo career, but the star says it was a tough but necessary decision, adding: 'I think one of the biggest reasons I decided it was time for me to manage myself because at some point you need your support system and you need your family.

'When you’re trying to have an everyday conversation with your family you have to talk about scheduling and you have to talk about your album and performing and touring. It’s just too stressful and it really affects your relationship....I wanted my dad.'

Beyoncé adds the decision to sever her business ties with her father, who began preparing her for super stardom when she was a child, wasn’t easy, revealing: 'It was hard. I had to sacrifice my relationship with my dad. It was stressful, sad, difficult time, but I had to let go.

When asked if she got her dad back, she says: 'I didn't get my dad back, but I had to let go.' However, as she cuddles Blue, Matthew is seen looking proudly on.

However, after firing her father, Beyoncé says she realised quite how hard Matthew had worked - and how hard the music business was, adding: 'My father taught me so much about being a business woman and I’m 
understanding him a lot now and I think I’ve realized that business and 
being polite it doesn’t match.

'I mean, you can be fair, but 
me being polite was not me being fair to myself. Now, I’m learning how 
political things are and a lot of the crazy things he did were 
necessary.'

In touching moments, Beyoncé is seen toasting Jay-Z for his 37th birthday in 2006 at a dinner with his closest friends, telling him: 'You’ve 
taught me so many things.

'You’ve given me so much in life and this is not enough. It’s not enough
I can give you. I just want you to be happy. And every year, I’m even 
more in love with you and I want to spend everyday of my life with you. 
Happy birthday and I thank God for you every day.'

The couple are captured on holiday and coo to each other as they sing along to Coldplay hit Yellow at a bar, written by their close friend Chris Martin.

It's a family affair: Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles and sister Solange were at the premiere to support her

Although her husband was not at the screening in Manhattan, he joined his wife at the after party at Christie's on Tuesday night.

Jay-Z first referenced the couple's miscarriage in Glory, a track recorded within days of Blue's birth in January 2012.

Beyoncé suffered the loss several years before the birth of her daughter in January 2012.

In the film, she says: 'About two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time.

'And I heard the heartbeat, which was the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life.'

'I picked out names,' she recalls.

'I envisioned what my child would look like.. I was feeling very maternal.'

She lost the child in the early stages of her pregnancy.

'I flew back to New York to get my check up - and no heartbeat,' she says.

'Literally the week before I went to the doctor, everything was fine, but there was no heartbeat.'

During the documentary, viewers will see the star talk about the moment she discovered she was pregnant after sending assistant Melissa to buy pregnancy tests - and how she tried to keep the pregnancy under wraps.

She is seen rushing off to throw up while rehearsing for an ITV television special in the UK - and performing through her tiredness at the Billboard awards.

She says: 'Being pregnant was very much like falling in love. You are so open. You are so overjoyed.'

The singer famously announced her 
pregnancy by rubbing her tummy during a performance of Love On Top at 
the MTV music awards in 2011 and it went on to become the most-tweeted 
moments of the year.

She tells the cameras that the baby 
wants to introduce herself and is seen sharing a hug with Jay-Z moments 
after coming off stage.

In a previous clip, she says: 'People see celebrities and they have money and fame, but I'm a human being.'

'I cry, I get scared, I get nervous just like everyone else.'
