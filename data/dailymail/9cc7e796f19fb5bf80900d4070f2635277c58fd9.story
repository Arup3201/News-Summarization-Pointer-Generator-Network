Conrad Hilton suffered major injuries when he lost control of his BMW and crashed on a highway near Palm Springs on Saturday, authorities said today.

Paris Hilton's 19-year-old brother was taken from the accident scene to Desert Regional Medical Center.  His current condition is unknown, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Daniel Hesser said on Tuesday 

Authorities said Hilton was speeding shortly after midday when he tried to change lanes and hit a Volkswagen. Cops said he then lost control of his car and crashed into a tractor trailer.

Paris Hilton's younger brother Conrad, pictured in May at LAX, was involved in a major car crash in Palm Springs on Saturday

Firefighters used the jaws of life to pull Hilton from his vehicle. Police determined that alcohol or drugs were not factors in the collision.

Hesser said the CHP received reports about a reckless driver before the crash occurred, but officers were not in pursuit at the time. A CHP helicopter crew witnessed the crash.

According to TMZ, Hilton reportedly skimmed the back of another car when he tried to change lanes, which caused him to hit the back of a tractor trailer before he came to a stop at the side of the road.  

MailOnline has contacted Hilton's representative for comment.  

This isn't Hilton's first brush with the law. In 2011, he crashed into two parked cars in Los Angeles after a night out in West Hollywood.

The following year, he was arrested after testing positive for marijuana, which was reportedly a violation of the terms of his probation for a previous marijuana arrest. 

Conrad is the younger brother of socialite Paris and the great-grandson of hotel baron Conrad Hilton. The siblings are pictured in LA in 2009
