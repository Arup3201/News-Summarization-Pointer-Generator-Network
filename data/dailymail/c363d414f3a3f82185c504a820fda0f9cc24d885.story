A head teacher is to introduce lessons in conkers after discovering that 95 per cent of his pupils had never played the game.

John Cattermole took action after he spotted pupils at Littleport Community Primary School, Cambridgeshire, looking quizzically at horse chestnuts which had fallen from a tree.

He held a game during assembly and discovered that nearly all of his 416 pupils had no idea what to do.

Now Mr Cattermole has written to parents requesting their permission to teach pupils about the game.

He wrote: ‘We believe conkers is a fun, healthy game to play.

'It is also good for hand/eye co-ordination and gets children talking about maths and numbers as they play.’

Mr Cattermole even reassured parents that he had gone through the necessary health and safety checks. ‘I have been showing children how to play safely in assembly,’ he wrote.

Parents were asked to fill in a slip at the foot of the letter if they did not wish their children to play conkers – but not one of them has.

He said: ‘We showed them how to play during assembly, which is when I realised about 95 per cent of them had never had a game of conkers in their life.

'Educationally, playing conkers has got the children talking about numbers and counting in the playground, but really it’s just fun.’

The Health and Safety Executive has recently included playing conkers in schools in its list of top ten health and safety myths.

Its website reads: ‘Realistically, the risk from playing conkers is incredibly low and just not worth bothering about.

‘If kids deliberately hit each other over the head with conkers, that’s a discipline issue, not health and safety.’
