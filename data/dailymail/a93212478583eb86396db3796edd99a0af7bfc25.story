With a stern expression and his eyes firmly fixed across the Devon landscape, this cliff formation bears resemblance to a wizened old man. 

The similarity to a hardened and wrinkled face on the cliff edge was spotted by local James Norton near Salcombe, in South Devon. 

The image was posted by Mr Norton on the Toad Hall Cottages Facebook page and attracted more than 500 'likes' and numerous comments.

One compared the formation to the fictional character Treebeard from Lord of the Rings.

Another local, Darren Bines, said: 'No one has ever noticed it before, it's really weird. 

'It's something to do with weathering, the grass and a minor rock fall, which has literally brought the face to life.' 

Christine Bolsover suggested the mysterious man looked 'a bit grumpy', which was followed by the inevitable response: 'He's got a heart of stone.' 

Earlier this year, ferocious storms battered  the cliffs at Hope Cove, near Salcombe, Devon, and led to chunks of it eroding and crumbling away.
