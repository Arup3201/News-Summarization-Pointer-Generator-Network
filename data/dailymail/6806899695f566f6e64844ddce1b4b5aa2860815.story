A New York City cabbie's license has been suspended after surveillance video showed him pulling a pregnant passenger out of his vehicle and driving off.

CBS New York reports that passenger Leslie Cooper says she climbed into the cab in Manhattan last week, and the driver told her his credit card reader was broken. 

She offered to stop at an ATM near her Brooklyn home, and he told her to get out of the cab. It was cold, and she refused.

Surveillance video shows the driver pulling up to a curb, getting out and pulling Cooper from the car.

She landed on the ground, and he drove off. 

'I was just in shock — complete shock,' Cooper told the station.

'I was really worried about my baby.'

Cooper went to the hospital to be checked out and was cleared to go home. 

However, she went into labor a few days later and delivered her baby five weeks early.

She believes her cab ordeal brought upon the premature labor.

The driver has been identified as  Amin Jarjisu Issah.

New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission said Tuesday that the cabbie's license has subsequently been suspended.

Cooper said she filed a police report at the scene but had no visible physical injuries. 

She said police told her they cannot file any assault charges when she doesn't have any proof that she was harmed during the incident.

'It's a little heartbreaking,' Cooper told CBS.

'But this is life, and I'm just trying to deal with it.' 

Parents groups have now picked up Cooper's story and are fighting for change on her behalf.
