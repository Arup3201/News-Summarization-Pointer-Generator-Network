The former cabinet minister Tony Benn died in March at his home in west London

Tony Benn left more than £5 million in his will – but not a single penny is going to the Labour Party or any of the radical causes he championed.

The former Labour Cabinet Minister, who died aged 88 in March, bequeathed the bulk of his fortune to his four children.

Benn, who supported the introduction of a wealth tax, left an estate of £5,085,001, reduced after liabilities to £5,020,389, probate records revealed yesterday. 

It is believed that his four children Stephen, 63, Hilary, 60, Melissa, 57, and Joshua, 56, will inherit about £800,000 each after payment of inheritance tax. Benn’s wife Caroline died in 2000 after 51 years of marriage.

The will left nothing to Labour or any of the Left-wing groups – including the Stop the War coalition or the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament – which Benn supported. But he stated that any future profits from his diaries could go to charities or other bodies at the discretion of his children.

The will, which was drawn up in 2004, also left £1,000 each to two women, believed to be friends or carers, and £25,000 to Ruth Winstone, who edited his diaries.

Benn, who in his later years became a widely loved elder statesman of British politics, was a leading figure in the radical Left wing of the Labour Party in his heyday in the 1960s and 1970s.

Only one of his children followed him into politics: Hilary Benn has been Labour MP for Leeds Central since 1999 and is currently shadow Communities Secretary. Benn’s eldest son Stephen, who inherited the Viscount Stansgate title that he famously renounced, is director of Parliamentary affairs for the Society of Biology. Joshua is an IT professional while Melissa is a radical feminist author.

Benn and his wife brought up their children in a rambling four storey Regency house in Holland Park, West London. The property was believed to have been worth £3 million when he downsized in 2011 to a warden-controlled flat nearby.

Benn also owned an ancestral home, Stansgate Abbey Farm on the Blackwater estuary in Essex. His will requested that the property be left in trust for his family.

Benn was Britain’s youngest serving MP when he was first elected in 1950 at the age of 25. But after inheriting the title Viscount Stansgate on the death of his father in 1960, he was disbarred from the House of Commons. But he successfully campaigned for a change in the law allowing him to renounce his title and retake his Bristol South East seat in 1963.

Under the Labour governments of 1964-1970 and 1974-1979, he held several high-profile Cabinet positions including Secretary of State for Energy and Secretary of State for Industry.

The politician finally retired from Parliament in 2001, as he famously declared, ‘to spend more time on politics’.
