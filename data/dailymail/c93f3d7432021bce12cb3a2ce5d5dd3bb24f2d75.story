Britain must be more like Germany, David Cameron declared today as he warned schools are failing to prepare children for high level jobs.

The Prime Minister called for a ‘Germanic approach to skills’ because companies were complained that the supply of newly trained engineers, mechanics and other skilled staff was failing to keep up with rapid expansions in business.

But the comparison risked backfiring on the day that Germany cut its growth outlook for the next two years, slashing its prediction of 1.6 per cent growth for 2013 to just 0.4 per cent.

David Cameron today made a series of visits in the Midlands to highlight the need for more engineers, mechanics and scientists to boost Britain's economy. His is pictured talking to Jaguar Land-Rover employee Christopher Snape (left) at the firm's plant in Solihull

Mr Cameron complained that too many 
colleges worried about ‘ticking boxes’ for Whitehall and not preparing 
youngsters for the world of work. As a result Britain risked falling 
behind other countries in the ‘global race’.

He said there would be ‘rigorous’ exams in science, maths and technology and employers should ‘get into the local colleges and tell them what it is you want’.

Ministers across government are under pressure to focus on growth, with the Prime Minister putting the government on an ‘economic war footing’.

Revised growth figures this week showed the economy will shrink this year by 0.1 per cent, after previously being predicted to grow by 0.8 per cent.

Mr Cameron said there needed to be more 'rigorous' exams in maths and science

The PM was challenged on a visit to Lear, a car seat and electricals firm in Redditch over what he was doing to ensure UK firms could compete.

During a question and answer session he said: ‘As we try and reindustrialise our country, some companies like yours are expanding so fast they are saying to us, “we can't find the engineers, we can't find the mechanics and other skills”.’

‘There is no simple, easy answer to this because you can't create an engineer overnight.

‘You've got to go right back in the school system, which is what we are doing, and say, “right, are we encouraging kids to study the right subjects?”.

‘There was a time when local colleges were just looking up to government and saying, “right, what courses shall we study in order to tick all your boxes?”

‘We are saying, “forget that, instead of looking up to the government, get out there and meet with the companies and find out what they want you to train people up into’.

‘We need frankly to have a more Germanic approach to that skills deficit. I think we will crack it but it will take time.’

As a result of low growth and high 
borrowing, austerity cuts and tax rises will last another year until 
2018, Chancellor George Osborne announced in his Autumn Statement.

Mr Cameron held a 'PM Direct' question and answer session with workers at Lear Corporation in Redditch, Worcestershire where he called for a more 'Germanic' approach to skills

The PM also defended squeezing benefits while cutting corporation tax for businesses

Mr Cameron defended plans to squeeze benefits, with annual rises capped at one per cent for the next three years while cutting corporation tax for businesses to 21 per cent.

‘We are in a global race where you have countries like India and China and Indonesia and Brazil that are going absolute gangbusters and we have to recognise that's who we have to compete with.

‘It means the Government has to take tough decisions: we've got to make sure we keep our tax rates down; we've got to make sure we invest in our education system; we've got to reform welfare so it pays to work.

‘We've taken tough decisions but I think it will enable us to see our economy compete and succeed in a way that is fair to people.’
