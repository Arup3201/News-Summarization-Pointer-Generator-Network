One of the greatest footballers in English history has left just £115,415 in his will – less than half the £300,000 that Wayne Rooney earns in a week.

Sir Tom Finney, who died aged 91 in February, spent his entire career at Preston North End, scoring 220 goals from 1946 until 1960.

Sir Tom Finney won 76 caps as an England forward, scoring 30 goals

He also won 76 caps as an England forward, scoring 30 goals for his country and playing in three World Cups from 1950 to 1958.

He supplemented his meagre wages – capped at £20 a week for all footballers until 1961 – by working as a plumber, earning himself the nickname ‘the Preston Plumber’.

Probate records reveal that Sir Tom, whose wife of 59 years Elsie died in 2004, left his estate in trust for his family. The couple had two children: Brian Finney, 66, and Barbara Herbert, 63.
