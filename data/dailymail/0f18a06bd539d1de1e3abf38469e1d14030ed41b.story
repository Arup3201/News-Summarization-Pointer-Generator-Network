An army of green-fanged cannibal spiders is invading Britain - gobbling up smaller arachnids as they set up nests in homes across the country.

The eight-legged creatures are believed to be tube spiders - one of the largest types in the UK - and their bite is like a bee sting. 

Their thick black bodies range from between 1.5cm to 2.2cm wide, their fangs shine menacingly green, and they are known to eat their own mothers.

Blink, and you'd miss it - but this hungry tube web spider makes light work of wolfing down its prey as it leaps from its lair and devours another arachnid in Wales.

Mike Rance first spotted the eight-legged beast when he was outside his friend's house in Newport, South Wales, and neighbours pointed out clusters all down the street.

He decided to capture the moment the spider popped out for lunch on camera after first testing out the arachnid's appetite.

To his surprise, he found that the creature was a particularly fussy eater.

Mr Rance, 41 from Cwmbran, said: 'I spotted this one on the wall and shined a light on to it and could see its fangs.

'It was devouring another smaller spider – they're proper little cannibals.

'We tried to feed it a woodlouse but it wasn't interested.

'We then tried a normal sized spider but it didn't want to know.

'They only seemed to want to eat smaller ones, I guess they must be easier prey.'

After capturing one spider, he passed it on to a vet friend with a special interest in spiders as she owns 32 tarantulas herself.

She confirmed that they are in fact tube spiders, whose painful bites can last for up to six hours.

He said: 'There were about seven on the back of my mate's house when we first looked.

'One of the neighbours came out and asked if we were looking at the spiders and showed us a cluster of about 30 or 40 in his back garden then showed us one of a similar size in the front yard.'

'He then pointed out houses all over the street that said they had them – they're all over the place.

Dozens of cannibalistic fanged spiders have invaded a street in South Wales. The eight-legged insects are believed to be tube spiders - one of the largest types in the UK - and their bite is like a bee sting

'They're quite amazing to watch.'

Both sexes of tube spiders look similar and live on walls, fences, and the bark of trees.

Originally from southern Europe, adults can be found from June to November and create a tube-shaped web with trip-lines radiating out. 

Tube-web spiders are one of the largest spiders in Europe and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches, moths, bees and wasps.

They sow distinctive tube-shaped webs in cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands.

They first entered the UK 150 years ago from continental Europe, arriving on ships docking in ports. 

The females tend to be larger than males and can reach a body length of up to 22mm.

Segestria florentina is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm.

Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year.

They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours.

They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it.

Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique.
