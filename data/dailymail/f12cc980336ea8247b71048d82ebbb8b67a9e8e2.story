England's top football clubs, all out of the Champions League before the quarter-finals, are concerned their chances of signing the next generation of stars are being hampered by the FA’s new regulations governing agents.

The rules, which come into force next month after FIFA passed the buck on managing the middle men to national associations, include a ban on agents earning money for representing players under 18 years old.

As a result, clubs fear there will no longer be a level playing field in the global hunt for young talent because the players’ representatives will want them to sign for teams in countries where the agents’ code is far more relaxed.

And English clubs, who will abide by the rules, have further worries on how these restrictions will be policed by the FA, with agents no longer needing a licence to operate.

The competitive market in signing teenage prospects is shown by the Chelsea juniors who have just reached their fourth consecutive FA Youth Cup final. 

Among the class of 2015 are Jay Dasilva, plucked from Luton at 13, while Isaiah Brown, on the fringe of the first team, arrived from West Bromwich at 16.

BT Sport’s rugby coverage has been recognised for its class by most of its pundits, presenters and commentators being plundered for the World Cup. ITV are taking on loan Brian O’Driscoll, Lawrence Dallaglio (right), Ben Kay, Ugo Monye, Craig Doyle, Sarra Elgan and Nick Mullins while BBC 5 Live have made temporary signings in Matt Dawson and Alastair Eykyn.

After the fallout from England players’ bad behaviour on a Land Rover promotional day during the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand, it makes sense that none of the England backers have been given sponsorship days with the squad during the 2015 tournament.

However, the RFU claim the team have behaved ‘impeccably’ on sponsorship duty since Stuart Lancaster took charge in 2012.

UK Sport spent £46,272 on a survey by research company COMRES ‘reassuring’ the organisation their no-compromise approach to funding only Olympic medal contenders is overwhelmingly the right one. 

As predicted, the only real change is that participation numbers will now be taken into consideration in judging sports with equal medal chances. So basketball, whose loss of backing from UK Sport led to enough criticism of the no-compromise strategy for the survey to be commissioned, will continue to rely on special case hand-outs from Sport England to afford to participate in elite competition.

At a time when the ECB need to get their PR act together, head of selectors James Whitaker chose not to front a print-media briefing when announcing the England Test squad for the West Indies.

This meant when Whitaker, a hapless public performer, got in an embarrassing tangle with Radio 5 Live’s Pat Murphy over Kevin Pietersen and his possible England return, he did not have the press conference to redress the mixed messages coming out of the ECB over what KP has been promised — which is nothing.

Swimming have been remarkably positive about Sport England taking a whopping £667,895 from their grass-roots monies after a steep decline in participation. In fact Amateur Swimming Association CEO Adam Paker even welcomed ‘Sport England’s continued investment’. The sport realises the cuts could have been more drastic and the lost cash will at least stay in the sport as swimming pool operators, working with ASA, have been charged with making venues more customer-friendly.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter has not only turned down the opportunity to take part in a live TV debate with his three rivals, but also the opportunity to speak as a candidate at the UEFA Congress in Vienna next week. Instead Blatter only wants the microphone to address Congress as FIFA president.

Meanwhile, there have been a flurry of national association football chiefs from around the globe coming into Zurich for audiences with Blatter, which FIFA somehow claim is ‘business as usual’ rather than electioneering.
