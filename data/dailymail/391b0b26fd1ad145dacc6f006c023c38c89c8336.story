He has produced more than 1,000 artworks, including an eight-foot Da Vinci painting.

But artist Ani K doesn't use a brush to create his masterpieces - he paints with his tongue.

The 35-year-old, from Kerala, licks the paint onto a canvas, before tilting and twisting his head to form different strokes.

He also uses his palate to mix colours - scooping up different shades of paint on his tongue to form new colours and tones.

His unusual hobby has seen him create a range of intricate portraits and 
elaborate modernist artworks, including a rendering of Leonardo Da Vinci's The Last Supper and portraits of Jesus Christ.

Ani, who spends three to four days on each painting, said: 'I wanted to be a different kind of an artist.

'I wanted to try art which is distinctive - that is why I chose this medium, and it worked for me.'

Lick of paint: Ani spends three to four days on each painting. Above, he licks the shape of an eye onto a canvas

Alternative: He settled on the unusual technique six years ago after watching another artist draw with his feet - prompting him to experiment with his own style. Above, Ani draws a dark brown border around the eye

Finished: The artist has also tried painting with his nose, chin, elbows and feet. Above, he signs the painting

He settled on the unusual technique six years ago after watching another artist draw with his feet - prompting him to experiment with his own style.

'I have tried painting with my nose, my chin, my elbows and my feet,' said Ani, who works as a teacher at Lords Public School in the south-west state.

'I also tried drawing with both hands simultaneously, and also while riding on a moving bike.'

Side effects: Ani, who works as a teacher at Lords Public School, said painting with his tongue caused a number of side effects, including headaches, a painful jaw and a loss of vision. Above, his painting of Jesus

However, he said he wasn't keen on 
passing on his talents to his students - as painting with his tongue 
causes a number of side effect, such as headaches and a painful jaw.

'After painting with my tongue, i experience pain in jaws, headaches, slight loss of vision and a dip in memory power,' he said. 'The side effects stay for around two weeks.

'Even though I use modern water colours which are non-toxic, the fumes and the smell still have side effects.

Demonstrations: Ani, who keeps his vast array of artworks in a shanty studio (pictured), refuses to sell the products - instead, performing public demonstrations for up to 500 people at a time

'Because of this, I don't teach kids the tongue technique - I ask them to follow the conventional styles.'

Ani, who keeps his vast array of artworks in a shanty studio, refuses to sell the products - instead, performing public demonstrations for up to 500 people at a time.

'This has become a way of life me,' he said. 'I have reached a situation where, without painting, there is no me.'

He now hopes to turn his passion into a Guinness World Record by painting four portraits using both of his hands and feet at the same time.
