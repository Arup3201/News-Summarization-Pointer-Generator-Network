The man who strangled and bashed his ex-girlfriend, Kate Malonyay, to death may have murdered her after she found out he had spun a web of lies about his life during their one-year relationship.

An inquest into Ms Malonyay's death also revealed Elliot Coulson - an ex-navy officer - was texting her friends from her phone after her death to make it look like she was still alive.

In the messages posing as Ms Malonyay, Coulson was assuring the 32-year-old's friends that she was okay and taking time off work.

The popular 32-year-old had been strangled and bashed to death in her Mosman home by her ex-boyfriend Elliott Coulson

She had actually been strangled and bashed to death in her Mosman by Coulson, the NSW Deputy State Coroner Hugh Dillon found.

'One of her friends was in the police station [after her body had been found] when she received a text,' he told the Coroner's Court on Friday.

Ms Malonyay's bruised body was found in the bed of her Mosman unit on April 22 last year.

'There is evidence of blunt force being inflicted to Kate's head - both the back of the head and the left side of her face and some facial fractures to the left side of the face,' Mr Dillon said.

Days after Kate Malonyay was found dead, friends kept receiving text messages from her phone assuring them she was okay and was taking sick leave from her job

Concerned friends had asked police to check on her welfare because she hadn't been seen since leaving work five days earlier

'Bruises, lacerations and abrasions were found all over Kate's body. Some deep bruises were found on her back on the left hand side.'

Concerned friends had asked police to check on her welfare because she had not been seen since leaving work five days earlier.

Her phone and credit cards were missing but texts linked to her mobile number were still being sent to her friends.

The source was traced to the Marriott Hotel on Queensland's Gold Coast, where Coulson was staying after going absent without leave from his systems analyst job at the navy.

When Queensland and NSW detectives went to speak to Coulson two days after Ms Malonyay's body was found, he jumped to his death from his hotel room on the 26th floor.

The coroner found DNA evidence, Coulson's flight to Queensland, his suicide, impersonation of Ms Malonyay and his unexplained leave from the navy formed part of the compelling evidence that Elliott Coulson killed Kate Malonyay.

The coroner's findings reveal that, in the weeks leading up to her death, Ms Malonyay had learnt that much of what Coulson had told her about himself was lies, and had begun speaking to his family.

It was also revealed Ms Malonyay had uncovered Coulson had been lying to her about how much he earned, his job position, his whereabouts and the value of a gift, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

The state coroner said Coulson also pretended his father had a brain tumour and his twin brother had died in car accident.

Mr Dillion said Coulson went as far as bringing Ms Malonyay to his alleged dead brother's grave site to keep up the pretense.

It is believed Ms Malonyay became aware of Coulson's lies in April 2013 and had started making enquiries about him when she became suspicious.

Evidence was also heard from a woman who had been in a relationship with Coulson before, according The Daily Telegraph.

She gave a similar account of his compulsive lying behaviour, including erratic tendencies and jealousy.

It was one incident in particular that Mr Dillon drew from where the woman told of how Coulson latched onto her hair, shoved her against a door frame and pinned her on a mattress, putting his hands around her throat.

The injuries the woman suffered were similar to the one launched on Ms Malonyay.

Her death highlighted domestic violence issues and Mr Dillon plans to write to ask NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli to consider introducing classroom courses on abusive relationships.

'If we can help young people understand abusive relationships ... some of those tragedies can be averted,' Mr Dillon said.

Mr Dillon passed his condolences to Ms Malonyay's mother, Wendy, for the loss of her 'fine, much-loved' daughter.
