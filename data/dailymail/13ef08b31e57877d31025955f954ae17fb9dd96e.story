A 15-year-old western Michigan boy faces a detention hearing in the stabbing of his 13-year-old sister in their Caledonia Township home.

Sheriff's deputies found the girl with multiple stab wounds about 1 p.m. Saturday after her 15-year-old brother called 911, the Kent County Sheriff's Department said in a news release.

She was taken by an emergency helicopter to a Grand Rapids hospital. Authorities have not yet released her condition.

Her brother was arrested Saturday at their home, southeast of Grand Rapids. Their names haven't been released. 

WOOD-TV reported that their father was at work at the time of the stabbing.

Neighbor Steve Murad said in an interview with the television station 'You know they have that brother-sister spat, obviously we all do when we are younger, but this is over the edge, this is ridiculous.'

Murad described the victim as '13-years-old, I mean, whole life ahead of her, really, really uplifting, good girl, funny, caring, takes care of like I said, my children, my little babies - so, good, good girl.'

The Grand Rapids Press reported that the girl's 15-year-old brother is due Monday in Kent County Juvenile Court.

The newspaper, citing medical workers, reported that the boy's alleged weapon was a 3-inch knife.

A prayer vigil was held Sunday outside Caledonia High School's football stadium for the 13-year-old girl. Both siblings attend schools in the district.

Jason Wangerin told WOOD-TV the victim and his daughter are best friends.

He told the television station 'My daughter is very distraught over this.'

'I look at the questions my daughter asks me and then I've got to come up with answers to those questions,' Wangering also said. 

School district officials said in a letter obtained by WOOD-TV 'We have confirmed that the students attend our school district with one attending Duncan Lake Middle School and the other at Caledonia High School.'

'Tragic situations are very difficult for students to process and understand, which allows for students to respond in many different ways,' the letter also said. 'Our students' first source of support is at home with their parents. As a school system, our District Crisis Response team is currently preparing to assist our students as they return to school on Monday. Our entire district staff have been made aware of the situation, and will be attentive to students throughout the district. Additional counselors and social workers will be available at DLMS and CHS.'
