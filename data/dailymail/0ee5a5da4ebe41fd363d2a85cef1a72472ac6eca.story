A young family fell ill after relocating to a suburban home which unbeknown to them had been used by the last tenants as a huge marijuana greenhouse.

Christy Edgel, her husband Jesse and four children recently moved from Utah to Cypress, Texas after Jesse lost his job.

Almost immediately, the family became sick, complaining of sore throats, stinging eyes and congestion. Mrs Edgel said her two-year-old daughter was the sickest.

Unaware: The Edgel family, from Utah, relocated to Texas and moved into a home which had previously been used as a marijuana greenhouse

Luxury: The 4,000 square foot home in Cypress, Texas was rented to the young family but they were not informed of its previous use as a cannabis greenhouse

The family were completely unaware that the luxury, four-bedroom, 4,000-square foot home had been raided on August 21 as part 
of a massive drugs bust involving 50 homes.

No one had been living at the home but it had been used by drug dealers to grow 400 plants.

Mrs Edgel told TV station KRIV: 'My eyes were burning. My throat was burning. My chest felt heavy.

'Then I became very congested. My youngest daughter started getting green goop in her eyes, and she would cough until she threw up.'

It was then that Mrs Edgel discovered mould growing all over the house, in particular in her youngest daughter's bedroom.

Busted: In August, a sting operation uncovered 400 plants being grown at the home by drug dealers

Behind closed doors: The suburban home was raided by narcotics officers in August where 400 cannabis plants were found inside

The sickly conditions appear to have been caused by the 'greenhouse' conditions of the marijuana factory. The heat in the house was kept high and water sprayed, making the atmosphere damp and humid.

Along with her concerns for her family's health, Mrs Edgel was also worried what the environment would do to irreplaceable family heirlooms such as the 1930s grand piano she inherited when her grandmother died last year.

Although landlords must tell prospective tenants if the home has previously been used to cook methamphetamine, they are not obliged to reveal if the property has been used to grow marijuana.

The owner has now agreed to return the family's $2,000 deposit and $2,000 rent they had paid.

Damages: When the family examined the home closer, there was mould growing in the walls and vents (left)
