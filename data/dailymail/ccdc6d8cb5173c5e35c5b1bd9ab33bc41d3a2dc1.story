Shatner in his heyday: Captain Kirk (right, with Leonard Nimoy) narrates NASA's mini-documentary about the Mars mission

Next week, one of the most daring missions in space will take place as Nasa pushes the final frontier with a trip to Mars.

The Curiosity vehicle, which is the size of a car, will use a combination of parachutes, thrusters, and even a 'sky crane' to navigate its way through the thin Martian atmosphere and land in a crater.

The mission will culminate in 'seven minutes of terror' as Curiosity relies on a complex series of instructions being executed perfectly.

Despite the intellectual skills and clever technological tricks employed by Nasa, this may all sound a little quaint to Star Trek fans more used to galaxy-sprawling adventures in the 23rd century.

So perhaps that is why Nasa asked William Shatner - aka Captain James T. Kirk - to narrate their documentary of those seven minutes.

The Shatner presented video will be used at events around the country and shared on the web and social media.

Also providing an alternative version of Shatner is Will Wheaton, who joined the Next Generation to play 'Wesley Crusher'.

Each provided their own unique narration to the video, which Nasa hopes will make the videos more appealing to a wide range of audiences.

The actors are icons to sci-fi fans worldwide through their work on Star Trek - albeit in two different generations of the show.

A recent study suggested that just digging inches beneath the surface could 
uncover complex organic molecules that could show that life once existed
on Mars.

The rover, in a protective capsule, will hit the top of the Martian atmosphere at 20,000km/h (13,000mph) and attempt to slow to just one metre per second to execute a soft touchdown.

The landing system includes a supersonic parachute and a rocket-powered crane.

It was expected that the Odyssey orbiter would track the whole descent, relaying UHF signals from the rover right up to the landing and for a few minutes beyond.

The scoop on
Curiosity, which is due to arrive on Mars in August, will dig four 
inches beneath the surface - enough to find the complex building blocks 
of life, particularly in new craters excavated by recent asteroid 
impacts.

Some scientists such as Jay Melosh of 
Purdue University believe that life may even have originated on Mars, 
then been carried to Earth on asteroids.

The
results suggest that, should Mars harbor simple organic molecules, 
NASA’s prospects for discovering them during Curiosity’s explorations 
are better than previously thought, said Alexander Pavlov of the NASA 
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, lead author of the 
study.
