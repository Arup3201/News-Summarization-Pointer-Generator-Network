As is often the case with Football League clubs, MK Dons have only entered the headlines this season when they have been the support act to a Premier League story - namely their demolition of Manchester United in the Capital One Cup and Tottenham's proposed groundshare at stadium:mk.

But back in the bread and butter of League One, Karl Robinson's side are quietly putting forward their strongest case yet for promotion to the Championship.

Robinson, still only 34, has been at the club since 2010, making him the fifth-longest serving manager in the country. In that time the Liverpudlian has turned down several approaches from Championship clubs, and with his side's league finishes steadily worsening in those four seasons - coming fifth, fifth, eighth and tenth consecutively - it looked as though he may have missed the boat to manage at a higher level.

But Saturday's emphatic 5-3 win at Barnsley - their fourth victory in six league games this season - has cemented MK Dons' place firmly in the running for automatic promotion.

If Robinson's side are promoted it will be a vindication of a patient approach to football they have shown both on and off the pitch over the last four years.

Much like Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, Robinson has sat tight while his board have got their house in order - expanding stadium:mk's capacity to 30,500 and selling prized academy products such as Sam Baldock, Sheyi Ojo and Brendan Galloway to balance the books. Even with those departures, now fewer than eight players who came through the ranks at the club were named in Robinson's matchday squad of 18 on Saturday.

On the pitch, Robinson is very much and advocate of a patient, possession-based game, as his side showed in their classy dismantling of United last month. In addition, Robinson - who has had John Gorman, Ian Wright, Alan Smith and Mick Harford on his coaching staff before - looks to have made an astute move in bringing in former Portsmouth, Crawley and Bury manager Richie Barker as his first-team coach.

Saturday's result means MK Dons are now League One's highest goalscorers with 14 goals in six games. While Benik Afobe - whose loan from Arsenal is a compliment to Robinson by Wenger in itself - and Will Grigg have been putting the goals away, it is the midfield dominance asserted by teen sensation Dele Alli alongside the likes of Mark Randall, Ben Reeves, Darren Potter and Samir Carruthers that best encapsulates Robinson's philosophy.

Robinson has smartly fed off the scraps of Premier League academies to build a young, hungry side. Where Randall (Arsenal), Reeves (Southampton), Potter (Liverpool), Carruthers (Aston Villa) and defender Jordan Spence (West Ham) lacked opportunities in the top flight, they have found a new lease of life in League One.

Of course, there is a sub-plot with MK Dons. They are one of the most disliked clubs in the land due to their 'theft' of Wimbledon's history and league status, but that was nothing to do with Robinson and his squad, and they are doing all they can to build bridges with their stylish play.

All three sides relegated from Championship in May find themselves in the bottom half of the League One table at this early stage of the season.

That presents a great opportunity for the likes of MK Dons, Bristol City and Peterborough to win promotion, and that trio already look like they will take some catching.

Forget Spurs, there may be another side in white filling out stadium:mk in the upper echelons of English football before too long.

Good week for ... BURTON ALBION. Just seven games into the League Two season and Gary Rowett's side have already opened up a five-point cushion to the play-off places following Saturday's 2-0 win over York. Rowett, a former Premier League defender with Leicester and Charlton, has coached his side to five clean sheets already this season and will be looking for a sixth when Burton travel to Wimbledon on Tuesday night.

Bad week for ... LEYTON ORIENT. The east London club headed into the season full of optimism, with a new owner prepared to splash the cash and a squad that - on paper at least - looks better than last season's group, who finished third and lost the play-off final at Wembley. But Saturday's 2-0 home defeat by lowly Colchester has left Russell Slade admitting he has been told he is just one game from the sack. That game comes on Tuesday night at Notts County.

Talent scout: Teddy Bishop (Ipswich)

Ipswich have a proud record of bringing through youngsters and midfielder Bishop is the latest academy product to have established himself in Mick McCarthy's squad. Bishop - who only turned 18 in July - started on Saturday as Ipswich beat Millwall 2-0. He was one of four academy products in McCarthy's matchday 18.
