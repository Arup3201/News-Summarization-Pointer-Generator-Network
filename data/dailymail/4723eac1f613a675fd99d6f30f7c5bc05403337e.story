All he wanted was a tidy garden. But when Stanley Lee decided to burn some pine needles to clear his lawn, this was the disastrous result.

After starting an incinerator to burn the waste, the 88-year-old checked twice that it was ‘smoking nicely’ before heading indoors, believing the fire was under control.

Just moments later, a spark shot from the burner on to a wooden fence, turning his small garden fire into a huge blaze which caused thousands of pounds worth of damage.

Blaze: The inferno destroyed four garden sheds and their contents, a neighbour's £4,000 summerhouse, a children's trampoline and sections of fencing separating four houses

Hot spot: The retired engineer only realised something was wrong when wife Peggy, 85, told him their back garden was on fire. By that stage his neighbours had already alerted the fire brigade and officers quickly extinguished the blaze

Feeling the heat: Pensioner Stanley Lee was shocked as he looked at the damage the fire in the garden of his bungalow home in Bournemouth had caused

With flames shooting 25ft into the air, 
the fire spread to the gardens of four neighbouring houses, destroying 
four garden sheds as well as fencing, and seriously damaging a £4,000 
summerhouse and a trampoline.

While a neighbour tried to kill the flames
using his garden hose, Mr Lee was oblivious – until his wife Peggy, 85,
told him she could see flames.

By that stage his neighbours had already alerted the fire brigade and officers quickly extinguished the blaze.

Today, surveying the damage in his garden of his bungalow home in Bournemouth, Dorset, Stanley said: 'I’m sorry it happened.'

He added: 'I thought it was a good day to get the incinerator out. I wanted to burn some of the pine needles that had fallen from the tree.

'I looked out of the window twice in the space of half an hour and it was smoking nicely. I thought I had it under control.

'When I looked for a third time a few minutes later there were flames shooting upwards and spreading to the branches of my pine tree and my neighbour’s fence.

Shock: Mr Lee said 'When I looked for a third time a few minutes later there were flames shooting upwards and spreading to the branches of my pine tree and my neighbour's fence'

Mr Lee looked shocked as he surveyed the damage to his garden and his neighbours.

'A spark must have flown onto the wooden fence next to it and set everything ablaze. Somebody had already called the fire brigade and they were here before I could get outside.

'They told me to keep away from it. The fire had spread to my two garden sheds. Once it set fire to my fence the flames quickly spread to my neighbours’ fences that back on to my garden,' Mr Lee added.

Ruined: Neighbour Dominic Fabrizi, whose home backs onto Mr Lee's property, lost his beloved summerhouse in the fire. He said: 'By the time I had filled a bucket of water to throw on the fire I couldn't get near it'

Mrs Lee said: 'I was so shocked. Luckily it didn’t get near to the house.'

Neighbour Cathy Ellson, 56, said: 'The fire was out of control within seconds.

'It was licking up the fence and I thought it was going to reach the house.

'My husband Steve rushed out and grabbed the garden house but it didn’t do anything because the fire was so big by that stage.'
