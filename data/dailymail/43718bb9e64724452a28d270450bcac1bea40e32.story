Two thousand Cambridge University students have descended on to a city centre park for the 'Caesarian Sunday' annual drinking party - despite being warned by their colleges to stay away.

The undergraduates spent the afternoon playing boozy drinking games in fancy dress on Jesus Green - just yards away from families picnicking in the Bank Holiday sunshine.

It comes just one week after college chiefs urged students not to attend the drinking party, which has taken place for the last 80 years.

The high-spirited students - some in fancy dress -  appear to be 'funelling' alcohol as they are surrounded by empty drinks bottles and cans

Around 2000 undergraduates spent the afternoon playing drinking games at the 'Caesarian Sunday' party on Jesus Green, just metres away from families picnicking in the spring sunshine

Caesarian Sunday is seen as the birth of the drinking parties for the summer term which ends with the notorious after-exams party, Suicide Sunday, in June.

The university had warned students not to bring shame on the institution, but many ignored the advice and celebrated the start of the summer term by downing alcohol using funnels and vomiting.

The students arrived at midday, wearing university blazers or fancy dress, and carrying alcohol in buckets and trollies.

They were seen drinking throughout the afternoon, spraying each other with beer, bottles of wine and water pistols and taking part in wheelbarrow races.

Some of the students were dressed as Where's Wally character, whilst others wore black curly wigs and moustaches or stripped down to their shorts.

Extra police were drafted in to control the event.

By the end of the afternoon many of the students could barely stand and had to be supported by their friends, others were seen vomiting on the grass and litter was left strewn across the park.

The event is historically held on the first May bank holiday of the summer term.

It usually begins with a wrestling match between the Caesarians and their Girton College drinking rivals. But this year the traditional fight was banned by the colleges.

The afternoon of drinking games included wrestling and undergraduates at the prestigious institution soaking each other with water pistols and bottles of wine

Five years ago the Suicide Sunday garden party, organised by the Wyverns, an all-male Magdalene College drinking society, had to be held in a new location for the first time in 80 years after officials banned students from holding the event on university land

The park was packed with revellers making the most of the Spring sunshine. The Caesarians society has a tradition whereby any initiated member can point at an invited male, or 'Legionary' as they call it, keeping with the Roman theme, and he must then down his drink

Police speak with some of the students. There were no arrests during the course of the day

Five years ago the Suicide Sunday garden party, organised by the Wyverns, an all-male Magdalene College drinking society, had to be held in a new location for the first time in 80 years after officials banned students from holding the event on university land.

The controversial decision was made after a 23-year-old student was arrested the previous year during the infamous jelly wrestling contest for punching a spectator.

The Wyverns drinking society has a reputation for its hard partying and excessive drinking.

Its initiation ceremony involves eating a 15-course meal with delicacies such as a pig's snout with wasabi sauce and a pint of water with a goldfish swimming inside.

There is no limit to the number of times this can be done to any one individual, and it has been reported that many don't make it much past the end of the meal.
