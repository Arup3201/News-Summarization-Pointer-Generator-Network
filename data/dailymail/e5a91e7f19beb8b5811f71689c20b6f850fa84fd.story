Thieves stole groceries from the decimated SUV of a Houston woman who was killed in a car crash while driving her two young sons on Wednesday.

The woman earlier went to her son's elementary school graduation before grocery shopping, according to a report by KTRK.

She was killed after her shopping when her Toyota 4-Runner hit another vehicle and then hit a tree, police told the station.

They added that they think she was responsible and did not wear a seat belt.
