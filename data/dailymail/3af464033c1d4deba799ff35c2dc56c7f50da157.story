A  father who tried to get a restraining order after he discovered footage of his son's mother screaming at their young boy- has had his case thrown out of court.

Shane Hamre was horrified when he discovered the shocking video on his son's iPad.

It shows a woman in her mid-twenties - said to be the boy's mother-  recording herself singing along to a track while her sons play in the background.

Shane Hamre has posted the video of this woman in her mid-twenties- said to be the boy's mother- singing along to a track while using the iPad to record herself

Suddenly she is distracted from her singing, puts the device down, and is heard screaming at the youngsters.

Her shouts are punctuated by several 'smacking' sounds, which Mr Hamre claims was the mother hitting the children. 

The concerned father posted the video on Facebook and wrote: 'I found this video on my son's I pad that was obviously recorded by his mother. I apologize for the horrible singing, but watch and listen after the 1 minute mark.

'You will hear her smacking my son and her other son, and the God awful things she screams at my poor son,' he added in the Facebook post.

'My son watched this with me and he was terrified his mother would find out I watched this and that he would be hit again. He said she hits him when she is mad. Nobody's kid deserves this.'

Mr Hamre, believed to be from Josephine County, Oregon, had taken the footage to Kitsap County Court, in Washington in an attempt to get a restraining order.

But he says judges refused and the young boy was sent back to his mother because they agreed that her household was more 'stable' as she was married.

Suddenly the woman is distracted from her singing after one of her two children, heard playing in the background, spills milk

'She argued in trial that her house is the more stable household because she would be at home all the time and they would be around her husband because it was highly unlikely he'd get sent away from Fort Bragg,' he wrote on Facebook.

'I knew she was like this, I just couldn't convince a judge.'  

In the video, the mother, seems to become angry after her one of her children spilled some milk.

She stops singing Blown Away, by Carrie Underwood, takes the headphones out of her ear, and walks off camera. 

She is then heard shouting: 'Get over here. 'Go clean it up.

'I am a single parent, I don't have a daddy to help me, it's just you two. Clean it up, with that. Go clean up the milk and you go help him.

'You spoiled brats, go clean up the milk.' 

Mr Hamre added that the reason the woman, based in North Carolina, shouts she is a single parent was because her husband was often away.

The video was originally posted to Facebook Hamre on January 5, and it was later uploaded to YouTube and has since received over 2 million views.

Mr Hamre has also made a report to Child Protection Services but he says they were unwilling to act as there were no bruises visible on the children or other supporting evidence.
