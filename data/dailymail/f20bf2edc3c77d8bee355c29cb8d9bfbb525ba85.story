Rio Ferdinand has revealed that criticism from Match of the Day pundits spurs him on to prove them wrong the next time he plays.

The QPR defender watches the show weekly and admits he would be bothered by opinions expressed on the show on how he could do better in some situations. 

The 35-year-old was back on TV screens on Saturday night, as QPR lost 1-0 at home to Hull - with the former England international's man-marking scrutinised by Alan Shearer and Ruud Gullit as he allowed James Chester to score the winning goal.

'Even as a player, you sit there and watch it on TV,' the Sunday Times reported.

'There were people on the sofa who you respected as a footballer and in the industry.

'But sometimes I would sit there and think, "how dare you think about me like that? Someone get me his number so I can call him!"

'And sometimes that becomes part of your fuel for the next week and the week after - "I ain't going to get embarrassed on Match of the Day."'
