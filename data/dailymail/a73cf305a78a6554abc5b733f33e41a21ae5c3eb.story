Leading human rights lawyer to review judgement on the peers who were given lengthy bans from Parliament

Lady Uddin: She claimed more than £100,000 between 2005 and 2010 and was apparently reduced to tears by questioning

Three Asian peers given lengthy bans from Parliament after wrongly claiming almost £200,000 in expenses are at the centre of an extraordinary legal battle over whether they were targeted because of their race.

The sanctions against Lady Uddin, Lord Paul, and Lord Bhatia were the most draconian against misbehaving peers in 300 years.

But now Labour peer Lord Ali has hired leading human rights lawyer Imran Khan to review the damning judgment on the peers by the Lords Privileges and Conduct Committee.

At least one of the three – Lord Paul – admitted he had ‘grave reservations’ about the disciplinary process used to punish him.

Asked if he thought he had been the victim of racism, he said last night: ‘I am very unhappy with the way I was treated but am not willing to comment any further.’

The suspensions, ordered last October, were the longest for the Upper House since the 17th century.

They were prompted by a series of revelations made by peers at the time of the MPs’ expenses scandal and led to a string of internal disciplinary probes.

Lord Ali, who created Channel 4’s Big Breakfast, was made a peer by Tony Blair in 1998 at the age of 34.

He said: ‘Something is not right about the way these three peers were treated. There were at least 12 members of the House of Lords who were accused of abusing their second home allowances. Yet only these three were singled out to be disciplined. Look at them.

‘All three are Asian. It does not look right. This process was flawed. At one point, when Lady Uddin was before the sub-committee she was reduced to tears by the questioning.

‘She excused herself, and went to the lavatory, but within three minutes they were bashing on the door demanding she come out.’

The Labour peer Lord Clarke of Hampstead also breached the rules governing the second homes allowance. But after he repaid £9,190 he was ordered to apologise in the Lords chamber and was not suspended.

Lord Ali, a multi-millionaire who gave up investment banking to set up Planet 24 broadcasting company in the 1990s with Bob Geldof, said: ‘I felt I had no choice but to ask Imran Khan to conduct an independent review.’

Lord Ali will pay Mr Khan’s fees but – whatever his conclusions – the House of Lords will not be bound to react to them.

Members of the sub-committee of the Conduct committee included Lord Irvine, a former Labour Lord Chancellor, Lady Eliza Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, and Lord Dholakia who for 25 years was head of the Commission for Racial Equality.

The intervention of Lord Ali has appalled many of his colleagues.

Lord Strathclyde, the Leader of the Lords, said in a letter to Lord Ali: ‘I regret that you have felt it necessary to pursue this route particularly in the light of assurances from Lady Manningham-Buller and Lord Dholakia.

‘In particular, I reject any suggestion that race played a role in the deliberations of the relevant committees and House officials.’

Tanzanian-born Lord Dholakia, a former president of the Lib Dems, said: ‘I have spent almost 30 years in the race relations industry. It is unthinkable I would be involved in anything that smacks of racism.’

Lord Taylor and Lord Hanningfield, who were Tory peers, were jailed earlier this year for 12 months and nine months respectively for fiddling their second home allowances after a police investigation. They are suspended from the House until May.

Lady Uddin claimed more than £100,000 between 2005 and 2010 by stating that her main residence was a small flat in Maidstone, Kent, rather than her family home in East London. She was suspended for 18 months and ordered to repay £125,000 in second home allowances.

Lord Bhatia had claimed £27,446 on the basis that his main home was a small flat occupied by his brother in Reigate, Surrey, even though he and his wife were listed on the electoral roll at their long-standing address in Hampton, South-West London. He was sidelined for eight months, has repaid more than £27,000 and resumed his seat.

Lord Paul, one of Britain’s richest men, lived in London but designated a one-bedroom flat in an Oxfordshire hotel that he owned as his main home. He was suspended for four months and has returned £41,982. All three also claimed travel expenses.

Lady Uddin and Lord Bhatia were found by the conduct committee to have acted ‘not in good faith’ by incorrectly declaring their main homes to claim overnight allowances. An initial investigation reached the same conclusion about Lord Paul.

However, on appeal the committee accepted that although ‘utterly unreasonable’ and negligent, he had not been dishonest.

Neither Lord Bhatia or Lady Uddin were willing to comment.
