Life expectancy for girls born in certain areas of the country could exceed 105, new government data suggests (library image)

Life expectancy for girls born today in some parts of England could average more than 100 years.

Those
 living in part of one northern town might expect to reach 105, while 
those in one Home Counties town will notch up 104 birthdays, Government 
data suggests.

The 
statistics from Public Health England have also exposed the staggering 
disparities in life expectancy in different parts of the country.

At
 the other end of the spectrum, for example, girls born in parts of 
Bradford and Salford will, on average, fail to reach their 73rd 
birthdays.

Men born in the most affluent parts of London and in part of Crawley, West Sussex, could average lives lasting nearly 98 years.

They
 can expect to live more than 30 years longer than their contemporaries 
born in the worst part of England for longevity – Rock Ferry, in 
Birkenhead, where male inhabitants will be lucky to reach the age of 67.

A
 girl born on the Northburn Estate near Cramlington in Northumberland 
has an average life expectancy of 105. For those born in Beggarwood, in 
Basingstoke and Deane, the figure is 104.3.

The
 other top areas for women are Marlow in Wycombe, Grange Park in Swindon
 and Lyppard Grange in Worcester. In all three the average girl will 
live to over 95.

The worst 
area for women is part of Holme Wood in Bradford, a council estate 
thought to be the largest in Europe.

The other areas in the female worst
 five are Patricroft in Salford, Portwood in Stockport, part of St 
Helens, and an area west of Hull city centre.

For
 men, the shortest lives are likely to be lived by boys born in Rock 
Ferry, Radford in Nottingham, Grange Park in Blackpool, and two areas in
 central Leicester.

The Northburn estate is a surprise in the best five because it is not particularly affluent. The average house costs £130,000.

The
 Rev Stephen Hewitt, team rector for Cramlington, said he had been 
struck by the number of women he had met who were 100 or well into their
 nineties.

‘I would say it’s
 likely down to them being a hardy breed, rather than their lifestyle,’ 
he told the Sunday Times. ‘Many of them grew up in a tough area, through
 the depression and war.’

Professor
 John Newton of Public Health England said that from 2000 to 2012 life 
expectancy in England rose by 3.2 years for men and 2.4 years for women.

But he said ‘profound inequalities’ remained and public agencies needed to work with local people to create healthy communities.
