Nathan Greenaway, 33, from Aldershot, died from multiple organ failure after allegedly brushing against the poisonous aconitum plant at Millcourt House, in the  Upper Froyle near Alton, Hampshire

A 33-year-old gardener who tended the manicured lawns and flower beds on a businessman's £4million estate died after apparently handling a highly-poisonous plant, a coroner heard.

Nathan Greenaway was one of several staff employed at Millcourt House, in the exclusive Upper Froyle near Alton, Hampshire, which is owned by former venture capitalist Christopher Ogilvie Thompson and his wife Katherine.

The groundsman, from Aldershot, was experienced at looking after the gardens at the mansion but collapsed and died after apparently brushing against the deadly flower aconitum - also known as devil's helmet and monkshood - which was growing in the grounds.

A pre-inquest hearing in Basingstoke, Hampshire, was today told that Mr Greenaway died in hospital from multiple organ failure.

After mysteriously falling ill in September, the gardener was taken to hospital but despite frantic analysis of his blood, doctors were unable to diagnose him. He died of multiple organ failure  five days later.

The coroner heard that it was only after his devastated father, Richard Greenaway, carried out hours of tireless research in an effort to find out what happened, that the link with the aconitum plant became apparent.

North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley heard a report from histopathologist Asmat Mustajab, who concluded it was 'more likely than not' that Mr Greenaway died after coming into contact with the deadly purple flowering plant.

Mr Greenaway was employed by South African-born Mr Ogilvie Thompson and his wife to maintain the manicured gardens of their sprawling estate.

Millionaire Mr Ogilvie Thompson is a consultant for high-end technology companies and formerly worked as venture manager for operations at Element Six Ventures, a fund focusing on early and growth phase investments in material science companies.

The inquest was told that the gardener was thought to have handled the highly-toxic plant, which is a member of the buttercup family of ranunculaceae, while working on the estate. He died on September 7.

Poisioning from the aconitum plant can occur if it is ingested or handled without gloves.

In severe cases, the poisoning causes heart arrhythmia, paralysis of the heart and respiratory problems. Other symptoms include vomiting, dizziness and diarrhoea.

Aconitum is also known as monkshood and devil's helmet due to its resemblance to a drawn hood, and is known by some as wolfsbane, because its poison is so toxic that it was once used to kill wolves.

The attractive plant has been responsible for several high-profile human deaths, including that of Canadian actor Andre Noble, who died on a camping trip in 2004 after accidentally consuming the plant.

In 2009 Brit Lakhvir Singh, dubbed the 'curry killer', poisoned her lover Lakhvinder Cheema with a curry dish laced with Indian aconite, from the same plant family.

Barrister Tim Sharpe, representing the Ogilvie Thompsons, told the pre-inquest that an expert on plant toxicology was needed to establish whether or not coming into contact with aconitum was the definitive reason for Mr Greenaway's death.

Coroner Mr Bradley said that, while blood samples taken after Mr Greenaway's death were still available for analysis, the sample taken at the time of his admission had since been destroyed.

Dr Maggie Bloom, representing the family of Mr Greenaway, said: 'There's even a note in the medical records where it says all samples are to be retained.'

The hearing was also told that the plant's deadly toxin works so quickly that it would have caused huge damage to Mr Greenaway's internal organs within hours and would have been out of his blood system altogether within a day.

The gardener's widow, Tegan, and his parents, Richard and Marian, listened intently to the proceedings with other members of the family.

Addressing them at the end of the hearing, Mr Bradley said: 'I'm sorry that we are not progressing this today. I am acutely aware of the difficulties that go with these cases and we will achieve what we can.'

Mr and Mrs Ogilvie Thompson's Grade II-listed Georgian house lies at the heart of a complex of outbuildings, staff cottages and tennis courts at the end of a long gravel drive, next to the River Wey.

At the back there is a veranda with seating room for at least a dozen guests.

A member of staff, who asked not to be named, today described Mr Greenaway as 'a really nice guy who was really good to work with.'

Mrs Ogilvie Thompson said the couple did not wish to comment on the inquest or the circumstances leading to their gardener's death.
