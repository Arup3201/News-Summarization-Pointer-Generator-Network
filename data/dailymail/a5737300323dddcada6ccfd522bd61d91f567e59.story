Viewers of new Channel 4 documentary Born In The Wild have reacted with shock after graphic scenes of animal mating were shown during the pre-watershed programme.

The second episode of the documentary series, presented by vet Mark Evans and comparative anatomist Joy Reidenberg, was aired at 8pm on Sunday.

It included graphic scenes of animals - including kangaroos and koalas - mating and giving birth despite it being aired before Ofcom's watershed of 9pm.

Other scenes that appeared to surprise viewers involved human stimulation of animals in a bid to ensure fertilisation and help the survival of endangered species.

Viewers took to Twitter to express their shock at some of the more uncomfortable scenes - which included graphic footage of koalas attempting to mate with fake female genitalia.

Katie Thacker wrote: 'Quitting and going to bed. Do not need to hear anymore aboout Koala's thrusting into fake vaginas' (sic)

Naomi Smith added: 'Soooooo I thought I was going to watch a show about baby animals. I was wrong. Thrusting Koala. What an eye opener.'

Claire Slevin: 'I am still trying to recover from #BornInTheWild last night. To be fair, I'm still recovering from the episode the week before.'

Bet Niamh: 'At least I can die a happy person now I know how kangaroos and koalas mate. #BornInTheWild.'

Dr Rjinswand said in jest: 'Watch #BornInTheWild they said. It'll be fun they said. No. Just a long list of animals being seually assaulted by a strange man.'

Later Joy Reidenberg watched two kangaroos mating in the Australian outback, picutred, before watching a newborn feed from its mother for the first time

Others expressed their anger that the show was show an hour before watershed.

Linda Pritchard: 'Born in the Wild should be on after 9pm - that is all.'

Other tweeted their support of the show. Sidney Snippets wrote: 'The conception, pregnancy and birth of kangaroos is absolutely amazing. Fantastic footage #borninthewild'

Michael Cook added: 'Wow #BornInTheWild is really interesting. First thing baby kangaroo does is go all mission impossible and climb up to get in mothers pouch.'

A spokesman for the show has been contacted by MailOnline.

Two viewers take to Twitter during the show. One said: So I thought I was going to watch a show about baby animals. I was wrong. Thrusting koala. What an eye opener'

Born in the Wild was first aired three
 weeks ago. The pilot followed the two presenters on a trip to Africa to
 investigate the reproduction challenges of the elephant.

A
 synopsis on the show's website says: 'Being so big is an advantage in 
the predator-ridden savannah, but size can be an obstacle to mating and 
giving birth.

'Elephants
 invest a great deal of time and energy in each individual new-born, and
 raise their young in a protective family herd led by a matriarch.

'In South Africa Mark investigates how 
males find females in vast home ranges and finds out how six-tonne bull 
elephants manage to mate.'

Katie Thacker reacted to the graphic content in the show, writing: 'So many things I am uncomfortable with on Born In The Wild'

More viewers react, with one writing they were 'still trying to recover' after watching the programme

This week, the pair were in Australia looking at the mating patterns of two of the country's most famous creatures - the koala and the kangaroo.

Viewers watched on as Mr Evans used night-imaging cameras to uncover how wild male kangaroos track down fertile females before travelling to Queensland to watch koalas have gravity-defying intercourse.

Later, his fellow presenter Ms Reidenberg watched kangaroos mating in front of her before witnessing a newborn kangaroo feeding from its mother.

Ofcom has confirmed they are yet to receive any formal complaints about the show.

However, some praised the show - like Michael Cook who said it was 'really interesting'

Sidney Snippets said the conception, pregnancy and birth of kangaroos as featured in the show was 'amazing'
