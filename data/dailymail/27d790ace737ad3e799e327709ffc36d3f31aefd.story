This is the dramatic moment armed police swooped on a suspected thief accused of one of the biggest art heists in Europe.

Serbian police officers held a hooded suspected robber at gunpoint in Belgrade after Paul Cezanne's £68.3million The Boy in the Red Vest was recovered from a car boot.

The work by the French Post Impressionist was stolen from the E
G Buhrle Collection in Zurich along with three other masterpieces by 
Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh and Edgar Degas in 2008.

After delaying an announcement of what 
the painting was, authorities produced Cezanne's famous painting worth $109million, at a news conference today.

An art expert is now being flown in from abroad to confirm the authenticity of the painting.

Monet's Poppy field at Vetheuil and van Gogh's Blossoming Chestnut Branches were discovered undamaged in a car parked at a mental hospital in Zurich soon after the robbery.

Degas' Ludovic Lepic and his Daughter, worth about £6.9million ($11million) is still missing.

Police have now arrested three people in connection with the heist and dramatic footage shows police ordering one of the suspects to lay on the ground at gunpoint.

Images also show forensic teams scouring a car for the stolen painting, which was found hidden in the boot wrapped in cardboard.

Revealing the work at a news conference today the painting was closely guarded by two masked and armed police officers.

Also stolen: Monet's Poppy field at Vetheuil was also taken the heist - one of the biggest art thefts in Europe - but was later recovered

Beautiful: Vincent van Gogh's Blossoming Chestnut Branches, also taken in the robbery, was discovered alongside the Monet undamaged in a car parked at a mental hospital in Zurich soon after the heist

Still missing: Degas' Ludovic Lepic and his Daughter, worth about £6.9million ($11million) is still missing

Untouched: However the thieves didn't take Cezanne's Self Portrait with Palette - one of the most valuable paintings, insured for £61.5 ($98million)

The heist was conducted by three armed and masked men who witnesses said spoke German with a Slavic accent.

They said police raids and the arrests in the capital of Belgrade and in the central city of Cacak were conducted in coordination with police from several European countries.

Art experts have suggested the robbers took advantage of a low-security museum without knowing about the paintings or how difficult it can be to sell such well-known stolen art works.

The robbers took the first four paintings they reached when they raided the museum shortly before closing time on a Sunday.

Although the most valuable painting was among the ones they took, they left behind the second most precious picture in the room, Cezanne's Self Portrait with Palette, insured for £61.5 ($98million).

The stolen works were among some 200 collected by billionaire pro-Nazi industrialist Emil Buehrle who died in 1956.

He made his fortune producing weapons for Hitler's forces during the Second World War, including anti-aircraft guns which brought down many British bombers.
