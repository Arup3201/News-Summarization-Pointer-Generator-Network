Scientists have discovered that acid could improve the prospects of successfully treating Alzheimer’s, heart disease and stroke.

It may seem counter-intuitive that a destructive substance could improve health, but experts from the Riken Centre for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, said that mild acid can be used to revert cells back to a neutral state from which they can be turned into a variety of other cells.

This is a big step forward for the science of growing organs and tissue, vital in the battle against a range of diseases including Alzheimer’s, spinal cord injury, stroke, heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

Researchers from the Riken Centre found that exposing mice cells to mildly acidic conditions caused them to reset to a blank state within 30 minutes, The Daily Telegraph reports.

Experts believe that from this state any type of cell at all can be nurtured.

Cambridge University’s Professor Austin Smith wrote in Nature: ‘Remarkably, instead of triggering cell death or tumour growth as might be expected a new cell state emerges that exhibits an unprecedented potential for differentiation into every possible cell type. ‘

The breakthrough means the cure for some major diseases could come from within patients.

Professor Chris Mason, chairman of regenerative medicine bioprocessing at University College London said: ‘If it works in man, this could be a game changer that ultimately makes a wide range of cell therapies available using the patient’s own cells.’

The research follows news that Swedish scientists say they have written the recipe for making ethically acceptable, highly versatile stem cells in large numbers that could be banked and turned into treatments for patients who need to replace diseased, damaged and worn out body parts.

Researchers from Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute say they have found a way of safely removing a single, precious stem cell from an embryo and worked out how to make the lone cell grow and multiply, using a lab-made version of a protein that is found in the embryo.
