A couple who were reported missing by police have been arrested for speeding through suburban streets and crashing into motorists - with their newborn son on board.

Ashley Groizard, 20, and Michael Holman, 32, sparked a police search after disappearing with their son from the Hunter Valley in NSW, and were found by authorities after being involved in a car crash over 600km away in Warwick, Queensland.

The three-month-old boy was taken to hospital following the incident, while his parents appeared in the Warwick Magistrates Court on Wednesday.

Groizard and Holman faced charges relating to driving and drug offences including evading police, wilful damage, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, possessing a dangerous drug, and driving under the influence of drugs.

The Abedare couple were assessed by a mental health worker following their arrest on Tuesday night.

Both Groizard and Holman were found to be suffering from indications of psychosis and paranoia, and have been ordered by the court to submit to psychiatric testing, reported Australian Regional Media. 

The couple were allegedly under the influence of methylamphetamines when they allegedly drove on the wrong side of the road over the speed limit, rear-ended a vehicle, ran several red lights and hit a motorist at 8pm.

Officers found the vehicle at the scene, at the intersection of Dragon and Bracker St. 

Holman was allegedly aggressive toward the motorist and police, Warwick Patrol Group Acting Inspector Stewart Day said.

'The male passenger alighted from the vehicle with a cricket bat and (allegedly) damaged the other vehicle,' he said.

'When police arrived he threatened to assault police and officers drew their tasers and told him to stop. He did and the tasers weren't used.' 

The alleged car crash victim said the pair started honking her and began tailgating her vehicle 'aggressively', before rear-ending her, causing her vehicle into a tailspin.  

'My car spun and at one point I was facing them - I could see them and the car was still spinning and then they drove off,' she told Australian Regional Media.

'I was scared but at the same time I was just glad I was OK.' 

The unidentified woman expressed concern for the family, and said that when she later heard sirens she was worried they might have injured themselves or other motorists.

'I just wondered who they had crashed into now and hoped they hadn't hurt some family just trying to get home,' she said.

'And I hoped they were OK too - I didn't want them to get hurt either.'

NSW Police launched a public appeal on Tuesday to find the pair and their three-month-old son, after being reported missing by family on Monday.   

Both Groizard and Holman have been told to remain in police custody and the couple will appear before the Warwick Magistrates Court again on November 10.
