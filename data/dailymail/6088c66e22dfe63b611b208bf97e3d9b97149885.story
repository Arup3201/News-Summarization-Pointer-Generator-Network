R&B artist Ryan Leslie is singing the blues now that he's been ordered to dish out $1million to a German man who returned his stolen laptop.

The decision came down from a New York judge on Wednesday, ending a two-year legal battle with the German man who brought it back to him.

Leslie was desperate to find the computer and an external hard drive stolen from him in 2010, which he said contained several 'in development' tracks he was working on.

Facing defeat: Ryan Leslie is pictured entering Federal Court in Manhattan, on Wednesday morning before a judge ruled in favor of German auto shop owner Armin Augstein

He made a YouTube plea, urging anybody who finds the laptop to hand it in and receive a $1million reward.

But when German auto shop proprietor Armin Augstein turned up with the laptop, Leslie reneged on the deal, after he couldn't access the songs on the hard drive.

Reaping the benefits: Augstein, of Pulheim, Germany, said that he felt 'very good' about the verdict now that he's $1million richer

Armstein took him to court, and Judge 
Harold Baer Jr ruled that since Leslie returned the hard drive to the 
computer company to have it wiped of its contents, the songs were likely
there as Armstein returned it, according to the New York Post.

Augstein, of Pulheim, Germany, told The Post that he felt 'very good' about the verdict.

Speaking in German and translated by one
his lawyers, Steven Thal, Augstein told the paper: 'I'm very happy… that the 
American judicial system, which is so totally different from ours, 
functioned so well with a jury that are not professionals and are 
laymen.'

Augstein added: 'No one forced him to make an offer of so much money for a finder's fee. It seems like he believes that that which he promised, he doesn’t have to live up to.'

Leslie accepted defeat in the matter, 
evoking his own lyrics as he told his Twitter fans: '"Ain't no way to 
get around ups & downs." Jury of my peers rules for the plaintiff.'

As for Augstein, he told the Post that he is in no rush to spend his $1million award.

He told the paper: 'As we say here in Germany, we can only eat the chicken after it’s been plucked.'

Leslie,
who learned piano at an early age, scored a perfect 1600 on his SATs 
and attended Harvard University, and graduated at just 19 years old 
before making it in the music business.

Lost: Leslie was hoping that he could get back the unreleased songs he was working on that were stored on the stolen hard drive
