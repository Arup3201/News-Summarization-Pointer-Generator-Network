The pop star, who is in Australia with his One Direction bandmates following an appearance at the ARIA Awards on Wednesday, wrote: 'Heard the news about Phil Hughes. Thinking of you brother. All the love.'

Styles is from Redditch in Worcestershire, south of Birmingham in the UK, where Hughes played a season of county cricket in 2012.

Hughes – who remains in critical condition at St Vincent's hospital in inner-city Sydney - is well-known in the UK county cricket community, having played in Worcestershire, Middlesex and Hampshire.

The shocking incident, in which led doctors to perform emergency brain surgery on Hughes to reduce swelling on his brain, has significantly affected the international cricket community.

England Captain Alistair Cook said the team's thoughts and prayers were with Phillip. 

'It's taken us all with a lot of shock and we're quite disturbed by it,' he told the BBC.

'It's a really damp atmosphere in our change room at the moment. Hopefully he'll pull through.'

Some of cricket's greatest ever players tweeted shared of support including Sachin Tendulkar, Viv Richards and Ian Botham along with recently retired English cricketers Andrew Flintoff and Michael Vaughan and South African players AB de Villiers and JP Duminy.

Australian athletes including cricket star Shane Warne, footballer Tim Cahill and Wallabies players Israel Folau and Quade Cooper tweeted about their hope that Hughes makes a recovery.

Australian music legend Molly Meldrum also drew attention to Hughes' fight during his speech to mark his induction to the ARIA Hall of Fame at Wednesday night's ceremony.

'On behalf of us all here who love music and love cricket. To Philip Hughes,' Meldrum told the audience, fighting back tears.

'Our prayers - believe me from everyone here - are with you and certainly your family.

'Godspeed to a recovery'.'

Devastated friends of Phil Hughes have been seen coming in and out of the hospital where the fallen cricketer is receiving treatment.

Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke, Steve Smith, Brad Haddin, Brett Lee and Shane Watson visited Hughes last night as his family continue to stay by his hospital bedside, awaiting any changes in his condition

Wearing sunglasses, a checked shirt and baseball cap, Clarke made his way quietly into the hospital at 6.20am this morning.

An hour and a half later Clarke was still there with Hughes' family. An update on the cricketer's condition is expected in the next few hours.

At 8am Clarke was joined by former Australian opening batsman, Justin Langer, and former Wallaby player and now General Manager of Team Performance for the Australian Cricket, Pat Howard.

The three sat in the hospital cafe drinking coffee. Earlier in the week Langer had said he was 'too upset to talk' about Hughes, and for the most part sat grim-faced at the table, while Howard tried hard to keep everyone's spirits up.

Matthew Wade and Aaron Finch were also seen arriving at the hospital.

Clarke was the first of Phillip Hughes' teammates to show up at St Vincent's hospital on Thursday to visit the stricken cricketer.

More of Hughes' teammates are expected to visit the player and his family in the course of the day.
