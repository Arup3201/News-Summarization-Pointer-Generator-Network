She has done the Six O' Clock News and is still famously poised presenting the Ten O’Clock.

But Fiona Bruce has let slip a small guilty secret... she slips out for a snifter between bulletins.

New Broadcasting House is directly opposite the Langham Hotel, and the presenter has confessed she likes to go for a cocktail during the evening.

Secret: Newsreader Fiona Bruce has let slip a small guilty secret - that she slips out for a cocktail between the 6pm and 10pm bulletins

Today Miss Bruce, 50, who has worked for the BBC since 1989 presenting programmes including Crimewatch and Antiques Roadshow, reveals how she winds down in the hotel’s bar in an interview for Radio Times. 

By the time she has finished News at Six she has already spent several hours at work, with more still to come.

She said: ‘if I’m doing the six o’clock and 10 o’clock bulletins, I can slip out in between to the Langham hotel bar across the road and have an evening cocktail. I only ever have the one.’

It’s no wonder Langham’s Artesian bar is popular with Miss Bruce.

It was crowned the World’s Best Bar 2013 by Drinks International.

All cocktails cost £16.50 and range 
from classics such as a mojito, daiquiri, Classic Champagne Cocktail to 
more ‘innovative’ flavours and names available on the Butterfly Wheel 
menu including Secrets & Lies (Glenmorangie Ealanta, Noilly Prat, 
Pomegranate, Roase, Citrus) and  Beach Affairs (Martini Rosso, Campari, 
Juniper, Mandarin & Froken).

Speaking
 to Radio Times, Miss Bruce also said she worries about her daughter 
Mia, 12, growing up in a world where ‘hideously misogynistic stuff’ is 
posted about women on social media.

The presenter, who also has a son named Sam, 16, with her husband Nigel Sharrocks, said: ‘I’m astonished at the freedom with which a depressingly large number of men feel they can just say what they want and write the most hideously misogynistic stuff about women.

‘I look at my daughter and think, “God, I
 didn’t think this was coming your way.” I really didn’t. The misogyny 
on the internet is a whole area that you and I would never have thought 
was coming.’

Miss Bruce went on to say it astounds her
 when people stop her on the street to comment on the clothes she wears,
 saying ‘you think, “I really don’t like what you’re wearing either”’.

And the newsreader, who appeared in FHM’s Sexiest Women list five years ago, said the men she works with are not judged in the same way about how they dress.

She said: ‘They’re all good-looking men - I can’t think of a male presenter who isn’t a good-looking bloke - but, you know, they’re not judged by their suits and ties.’

In the past Miss Bruce has admitted dying her hair to cover up any grey strands because she realised ‘age is an issue’ in television.

A report last year found there are just 25 women aged over 50, out of 413 regular BBC presenters.

Selina Scott, 63, and Anna Ford, 70, are among other high-profile female broadcasters to have complained about their treatment by television networks.

But Miss Bruce said any fears she had about turning 50 were put into perspective when her close friend Nick Milligan and his eight-year-old daughter Emily were killed in a horrific motorboat accident last year.  

She said: ‘Because such a very, very good friend of mine died very young, far from being sad about the fact that I’m 50, I think: “Hurray, I’m 50 - and I’m still here,”

‘There’s nothing like that to put everything else into perspective. So there was no existential angst at all. It was all just a joy.’

If she does leave the BBC, Miss Bruce said she would like to become a magistrate.

She said: ‘I’d very much like to become a magistrate. I’ve thought about doing it part-time while I’m working here, but I don’t have time.’
