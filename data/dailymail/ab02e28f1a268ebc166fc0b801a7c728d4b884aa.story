A mother has made a YouTube video telling a boy to stop asking her daughter out.

Dr Lindsey Doe, a blogger under the name 'Doe Eyes' who specializes in sexual harassment, dedicated her latest clip to the teenager who has approached her daughter at school, on the bus, and with poems - despite multiple rejections.

In a post titled Dear Boy Who Likes My Daughter, that has amassed more than 250,000 views, Doe explains that pursuing somebody without consent is harassment.

Instead, she advises, he should write about his feelings in a diary.

'Leave her alone': Dr Lindsey Doe directed a message to the boy who keeps asking out her daughter

Doe, who used to work for the University of Montana, says: 'I don’t like how you treat [my daughter.] Are you confused? You probably picked up messages from society about how when you want something, you have to "try harder, go at it, do whatever you can to get it. Don’t give up!"

'Maybe it’s for this reason that you repeatedly ask my daughter out. In the halls, on the bus, and you write her poems.'

For his own understanding, she explains the appropriate way to act after asking a girl out.

If she says 'I don't know', give her space.

'Maybe' prompts a conversation about her feelings of uncertainty.

Only in the instance that she says 'ask me again later' should he ask again - but much later.

Doe, who blogs on YouTube as 'Doe Eyes', explains that he is harassing her daughter with his requests

If he wants to express his feelings, she explains, he should write a diary or speak to a trusted friend

But her daughter, she says, has simply responded: 'no thanks', 'stop asking me', and 'no, no go away'.

'Person Who Likes My Daughter, this goes for all aspects of your life,' Doe says.

'If someone tells you "no" in any way and you ask again, it's not cool, it's not attractive, it's not respectful, it's harassment.

'My daughter has the right to change her mind and the ability to let you know if she does.

'Until then I expect that you do not ask her out, do not suggest a relationship, do not talk to her about her discomfort with you pursuing her. Leave her alone.'
