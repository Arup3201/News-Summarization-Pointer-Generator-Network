Floyd Mayweather Jnr has confirmed he is negotiating a fight with Manny Pacquiao, but has played down reports that a deal is close.

Pacquiao claimed last week that he has agreed to fight his long-time rival on May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

But Mayweather insists there is a long way to go before the $200million mega-fight that has been more than five years in the making, finally takes place.

Floyd Mayweather denies the fight with Manny Pacquiao is close to being agreed

Pacquiao claimed he and his agent had agreed terms and are awaiting a signed contract from Mayweather

In a phone call to DJ Whoo Kid’s 'The Whoolywood Shuffle' show, he said: 'What everyone's been saying is false.

'I've been saying this for a long time, Pacquiao has no say because he fights for Top Rank Promotions.

'He's not in a position to call the shots right now; he's not the A-side. I have Mayweather Promotions, it's my company.

'Do I want to fight Pacquiao? Absolutely. Are we negotiating? Absolutely. Has the fight been made? Not at all.

'We have been going back and forth communicating with their team. Hopefully we can make this fight happen.

'Pacquiao said he had agreed to everything but what did he agree to? He has no say.

'He has a boss, it's called Top Rank Promotions, not Pacquiao Promotions.

'We're trying but its been extremely difficult. I don't want to point the finger at Pacquiao, it's not him, it's his promoter.'

On Monday, Pacquiao admitted he would look for another opponent if Mayweather did not agree to fight him by the end of the month.

And he took to Twitter shortly after Mayweather's interview to say: 'I can easily beat Floyd Mayweather, I believe that.

'If you really care about the fans, you will fight. If you care about yourself, you won't fight.'

'Everyone had me as a big underdog to Oscar De La Hoya too. If Mayweather fights me boxing will get an even bigger upset victory.'
