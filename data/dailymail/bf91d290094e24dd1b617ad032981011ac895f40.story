Swansea vs Chelsea (Liberty Stadium)

Team news

Swansea

Swansea start life without Wilfried Bony against Chelsea on Saturday with manager Garry Monk having told Bafetimbi Gomis he is now the main striker at the club.

Gomis will lead the forward line against the Barclays Premier League leaders at the Liberty Stadium and on-loan Portuguese striker Nelson Oliveira is now the back-up striker following Bony's midweek departure to Manchester City.

Swansea are short of midfield numbers as Jonjo Shelvey completes a four-match suspension and Ki Sung-yueng is away on international duty, but Gylfi Sigurdsson (foot) should play and winger Jefferson Montero could make the bench after making a quicker than expected recovery from the hamstring injury he suffered on Boxing Day.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Britton, Carroll, Routledge, Dyer, Sigurdsson, Gomis, Tremmel, Richards, Bartley, Amat, Emnes, Montero, Barrow, Grimes, Oliveira, Tiendalli, Fulton, King.

Chelsea 

The Belgium goalkeeper has been on the bench for the past two matches after sustaining a finger injury on New Year's Day against Tottenham, but is able to come back in for Petr Cech.

Chelsea full-back Cesar Azpilicueta remains sidelined with a groin complaint but is set to return to training next week.

Provisional squad: Courtois, Cech, Ivanovic, Luis, Cahill, Terry, Zouma, Ake, Fabregas, Matic, Ramires, Oscar, Mikel, Willian, Hazard, Schurrle, Salah, Remy, Costa, Drogba.
