Dozens of animal rights activist stripped off in central London on Sunday to promote World Vegan Day.

Around 100 PETA supporters laid in Trafalgar square, covered in fake blood, in order to draw a comparison between the bodies of animals and those of humans.

The animal rights organisation hope the stunt will encourage more to stop eating meat and use animal products.

'Animals feel pain, fear, love and joy, just as humans do, yet billions of them are killed every year for products that are poisoning the environment and contributing to the UK's obesity epidemic', says PETA Director Mimi Bekhechi.

'PETA is challenging people to think about the massive toll that the meat industry takes on animals, the Earth and human health – and to go vegan.'
