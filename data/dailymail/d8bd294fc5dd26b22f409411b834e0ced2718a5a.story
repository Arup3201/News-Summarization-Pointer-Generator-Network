Doctors believe Joanne Slater may have died as a result of having a gastric band fitted in 2005

A mother who had gastric-bypass surgery to have the baby she longed for has died from a rare infection believed to have been caused by the operation.

Joanne Slater, 38, from Stannington, Sheffield, had the operation to control a hormone imbalance which doctors thought caused her to gain weight and was preventing her from becoming pregnant.

The insurance worker had suffered three miscarriages, in 1995, 1998 and 2000, and tried dieting unsuccessfully before going under the knife in 2005 as a last resort when she reached 23st.

At first the results were impressive and Mrs Slater lost half her body weight before giving birth to Lily-Mai, who is now aged four.

However, she later developed serious nutritional deficiencies as well as a rare and deadly listeria infection discovered in her blood when she was admitted to intensive care at the Northern General Hospital.

The mother went into cardiac arrest brought on by pneumonia and suffered devastating brain damage which led to the decision to switch off her life-support machine earlier this month.

Michael Slater, Joanne’s husband, said her death was ‘such a shock’ and highlighted the potential risk involved with bariatric surgery.

The cancer nurse, aged 47, said: 'When Joanne had her operation, it was still relatively new and doctors are now finding more patients developing problems further down the line.

'It’s difficult - if she’d never had the operation we’d never have had Lily-Mai.'

Mrs Slater, a former pupil of 
Sheffield’s City School, met her husband when they worked together at a 
care home in Endcliffe, Sheffield. The couple tried for a baby for 
years.

Mr Slater said: 'We’d almost given up hope. You name the diet, Joanne had tried it. She had hormone problems and was given the opportunity to have an operation.'

A gastric by-pass makes the stomach smaller, meaning patients feel full more quickly and reduces the amount of calories absorbed by the bowel.

Mrs Slater had the procedure on the NHS at Thornbury Hospital, Sheffield, in 2005.

Her husband said: 'She did very well initially, it couldn’t have gone better. She was bright and bubbly, the life and soul of the party.'

As Mrs Slater slimmed down the couple took up active pastimes such as dancing and walking, and went on exotic holidays, including a trip to Africa in 2006 the same year they were married.

Lily-Mai was born three months premature in 2009.

Mr Slater said: 'Joanne was so proud. She was fantastic, everything you would want in a mum.

'But unfortunately her health got worse.'

Mrs Slater's weight loss became too extreme and she complained of muscle pains and tiredness. 

Doctors prescribed supplements for a lack of nutrients such as copper and vitamin D, thought to be a side effect of the surgery, but her health continued to decline and she developed a rare and deadly listeria infection in her blood.

Mr Slater said: 'The listeria really wiped her out. I asked the consultants if they had any idea how it got there and they said no. It’s a rare infection, they could only say it was probably related to the surgery.'

She spent Christmas in hospital and went into cardiac arrest on New Year’s Eve. 

Doctors managed to revive her but her brain was severely damaged due to a lack of oxygen.

Mrs Slater's parents Rita and David and her brother Doyle gathered at her bedside when she died on January 3.

Her funeral was held on Wednesday at Christ Church Stannington followed by a burial at Crookes Cemetery. 

Donations were collected for baby charity Tommy’s and future fundraising events have been planned.

Mr Slater said: 'I just wish that she had managed to lose that weight some other way - I wish it more than anything in the world.

'But unfortunately that wasn't the case. She tried absolutely everything - diets, exercise - everything.

'When Joanne had Lily-Mai we expected it would be the start of a long and happy family life together.

'I don't want to pin any blame on the operation because they did their best and we did manage to conceive as a direct result of the operation.

'But my daughter doesn't have a mummy because of the operation that gave her life.

'I have mixed emotions about the operation. I just wish she could have found another way to lose the weight.

'For anybody considering this surgery, my advice would be not to take the decision lightly.'

A gastric-bypass is when the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach so you digest less food and it takes much less food to make you feel full. 

People with a gastric-bypass will lose around two-thirds of their excess body weight. 

Procedures help the patient feel satisfied on smaller quantities of food and helps reducing hunger in between meals.

Some operations affect hormonal changes, which cause changes in women’s appetite. 

Surgery can now be offered to anyone with a BMI over 40, where lifestyle and medication have been ineffective. 

It also significantly reduces the health risks of women who have severe and complicated obesity.

Women are advised not to become pregnant within 18 months of having had weight-loss surgery. 

It is also true that, despite the advice to avoid pregnancy within a year of surgery, many women do become pregnant and go on to have a successful pregnancy. 

But during this time, nutritional deficiencies can occur. 

However, it is usual for all patients to be prescribed multivitamin and mineral supplements, and sometimes at higher doses.

After weight-loss surgery most of the weight loss takes place in the first 12-18 months. 

It is best to avoid pregnancy in this period, as the effects of weight loss on the baby are still not fully understood.

For women who had surgery more than two years previously, weight is likely to have stabilised. 

Women who are obese are less likely to conceive naturally and when receiving treatment for infertility require higher doses of gonadotrophins and more days of ovarian stimulation to achieve the desired pregnancy rates.

Obesity also impacts negatively on pregnancy and is associated with increased risk of gestationaldiabetes, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, the need for induced labour and caesarean delivery.
