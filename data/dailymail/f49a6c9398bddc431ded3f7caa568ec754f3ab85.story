Memory 'sports' are the latest trend for intellectuals across the world to show off their mental prowess.

The annual UK Open Memory Champions took place at London's Science Museum on Thursday and the intense event involved ten contestants lining up in front of chief arbiter of the World Memory Sports Council, Phil Chambers, as he put them through two days of rigorous memory tests.

Tests include memorising as many decks of playing cards as possible, or recalling lists of thousands of binary digits.

Chambers has now revealed some of the memory tips and insider secrets revealing exactly how memory masters are able to remember thousands and thousands of binary digits, in order.

One method memory masters use to remember sequences of playing cards, or rows of numbers, is to assign them with particular celebrities, actions or objects. For example, the Queen of Hearts, left, could be assigned to Princess Diana, right. Stories are then made up using these people, actions or objects

Most playing cards memorised - 1,456 (28 decks), held by Ben Pridmore

Number of binary digits remembered in 30 minutes - 4,140, held by Ben Pridmore

Number of binary digits memorised in five minutes - 1,016, held by Ola Kara Rise

The first step, Chambers said, is to stop looking at the digits as numbers and start seeing them as everyday objects, because this makes them easier to recall.

Chambers toldÂ The Times that the most effective way to do this is to use playing cards in place of numbers, and then assign certain attributes to these cards.

For example, the ace card is one, the rest of the cards go in sequence and then a picture card can be 10.

In the case of having to remember binary digits, another picture card could be used as 11.

One method is to convert the names of the cards into the initials of a famous person - the Ace of Hearts converts to 'AH', which could be Adolf Hitler. The Six of Clubs would become SC, or Simon Cowell, and so on.

It's also possible to take this method a step further and assign playing cards with celebrities, actions and objects.

This makes it possible to pair cards together to form longer digits, and helps create stories that make it possible to remember the order of the digits.

Memory expert Phil Chambers assigns the Four of Diamonds, left, with Neil Diamond, right, singing a song at a piano. He then creates stories such as Princess Diana met Neil Diamond, which becomes Queen of Hearts followed by Four of Diamonds, or the number 10 followed by the number four in a sequence

For example, Chambers said he assigns Princess Diana as the Queen of Hearts. The action is 'waving' and the object is a rose.

Neil Diamond singing a song at a piano is what Chambers uses for the Four of Diamonds, while the the Ace of Clubs is Tiger Woods and a golf tee.

A simpler method could be to use a person's initials, such as Adolf Hitler (AH) for the Ace of Hearts, for example

Chambers then creates a story using these, for example, Princess Diana saw Neil Diamond when they went to see Tiger Woods play golf.

This technique has the double benefit of being able to remember sequences of playing cards, but the numbers on the cards can also be used to remember strings of random digits.

This would be 10, for the picture card of the Queen of Hearts, four for the Four of Diamonds and one for the Ace of Clubs.

This sentence helps Chambers remember the sequence of numbers 1041, or alternatively, in the case of binary digits, 1011111 - where the number four is converted into four individual umber ones.

To reduce the amount of names, for example, this could also become Tiger Woods played a piano to a woman holding a rose.

This would be the Ace of Clubs and the Queen of Hearts followed by the Four of Diamonds, also known as 1104 or 1101111.

This method provides enough variables to remember thousands of digits and the current world record is 4,140 held by Ben Pridmore.
