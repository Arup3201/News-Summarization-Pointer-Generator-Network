Apple has sold more than five million of its new iPhones in three days despite customer grumbles about some of its software.

Fans of the brand flocked to shops to get their hands on its newest bit of kit when it went on sale on Friday.

In London almost 1,300 people queued outside Apple’s flagship store in Regent Street, while some camped at the company’s shop in Covent Garden for up to a week to be at the front of the queue.

Fans around the world queued for the new iPhone 5 on Friday - and today Apple said it had sold 5 million of the handsets in just three days

Apple CEO Tim Cook said: 'Demand for iPhone 5 has been incredible and we are working hard to get an iPhone 5 into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible.

'While we have sold out of our initial supply, stores continue to receive iPhone 5 shipments regularly and customers can continue to order online and receive an estimated delivery date.

'We appreciate everyone’s patience and are working hard to build enough iPhone 5s for everyone.'

The sales figures were announced as a new survey found Apple has taken Aston Martin’s title as the UK’s coolest brand.

Its new phone, thinner and lighter than previous models and can use the newly announced 4G network, costs from £529.

The 32GB model is £599 and the 64GB version costs £699.

The new 4G network offers speeds of up to five times faster than 3G and allows uninterrupted access to the web on the go, high-definition films downloaded in minutes and TV streamed without buffering.

The iPhone launch was followed by a flurry of complaints about the phone’s maps, with reports of geographical errors and missing information, and Apple have promised improvements.

The battle for domination of the mobile and tablet market has become increasingly heated recently with Apple’s competitors taking it on with a series of new products.

Nokia and Microsoft recently joined forces to launch two phones which will run on the Windows operating system.

Online retailer Amazon unveiled new models of its Kindle Fire tablets which were previously not for sale in the UK and are seen as rivals to Apple’s best-selling iPad.
