One is a luxury shirtmaker, while the other specialises in racy lingerie.

But these two seemingly polar opposite brands ended up locked in a legal battle – over the name ‘pink’.

High-end Thomas Pink, named after an 18th century tailor, took US underwear brand Victoria’s Secret to court after the latter brought out a range called PINK, which it described as being aimed at the ‘college girl’.

Luxury shirtmaker Thomas Pink has won a court case against  Victoria's Secret, barring the lingerie retailer from using the word 'pink' on its shop fronts and clothing labels

The London shirtmaker claimed this was confusing customers and that its brand, known for quality and tradition, could be ‘tarnished’ by association, while the underwear shop argued that the two target very different markets.

But at the High Court yesterday, Mr Justice Birss ruled in favour of Thomas Pink, saying its luxurious reputation could be risked by Victoria’s Secret’s ‘sexy, mass market appeal’. 

Thomas Pink Ltd, which began trading in London in 1984, was named after an 18th century London tailor who designed the iconic hunting coat.

It launched proceedings after Victoria's Secret opened outlets in the UK in 2012 branded as Victoria's Secret and PINK, contending that it had entered the territorial zone of Thomas Pink's exclusivity and was using PINK as a primary sign on its garments and stores.

It said it was obvious that the average consumer was likely to be confused,  and that some had already tried to return lingerie to the defendant's stores, or asked to buy Victoria's Secret goods in Thomas Pink stores.

Thomas Pink's lawsuit noted that this was likely to become the norm as Victoria's Secret became more well known in the UK in shopping areas close to Thomas Pink stores.

The company also argued there was a real risk of its brand being tarnished as it was known for quality and tradition while Victoria's Secret's message was sexy.

Victoria's Secret argued that it was a legitimate retailer and refuted the claim that there was something inappropriate or improper about its trading.

It accepted that the two businesses were both related to clothing in general terms but said they were at opposite ends of the spectrum with Thomas Pink having older professional customers.

In it's claim, Thomas Pin argued that its exclusive brand would be 'tarnished' if it became associated with the 'sexy, mass-market appeal' of Victoria's Secret 

It said that the Victoria's Secret brand was a famous one and when customers encountered PINK, it was always firmly in the context of that famous name, which ruled out any conceivable possibility of confusion.

But, at London's High Court today, Mr Justice Birss ruled that Victoria's Secret's use of PINK both on its goods and as the name of its stores was an infringement of Thomas Pink's trade mark rights.

He said that the use of PINK emblazoned on the defendant's items of clothing gave rise to a likelihood of confusion as did its shop faces.

The fact that some PINK stores were beside a Victoria's Secret store or linked inside did not make any difference, as the average consumer would not normally pay any attention to this. 

The judge said that Victoria's Secret's use of PINK would cause a detriment to the repute of Thomas Pink's mark, although noted that the term 'tarnishment' was perhaps too harsh.

The judge said: 'The defendant's overall business is a legitimate one. Nevertheless, it is one which had been associated with some controversy, no doubt because "sexy sells".

'Examples were in the evidence of goods which had to be withdrawn by the defendant after complaints. The defendant's business aims to have a sexy, mass market appeal.

'The link between the CTM (Community trade mark) and the defendant's PINK brand will cause consumers to associate the two. 

'The claimant's trade mark will be associated with a mass market offering, reducing its luxurious reputation.

'"There is every risk that this will lead consumers not to buy products from the claimant when they otherwise would have done.'

Later, Jonathan Heilbron, president and chief executive officer at Thomas Pink said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case, and will continue to protect the considerable investment that has been made into building Thomas Pink into a leading luxury clothing brand.'
