A casualty consultant who sent a dying woman home from hospital with painkillers had her written apology to the family literally thrown back in her face at an inquest today.

Angry mum Carole Woodward flung the hand-written apology across the courtroom towards A&E consultant, Delia Parnham-Cope, as she gave evidence at the inquest in Gloucester.

Mrs Woodward’s daughter, Jayne Hughes, 44, died at home on December 19 from an undiagnosed pulmonary embolism - a blood clot on the lungs.

She had been rushed into Gloucestershire Royal Hospital A&E two days earlier after becoming dizzy and falling downstairs, banging her head and shoulder, at her home in Lydney, Gloucestershire.

The inquest heard that Ms Hughes was breathless, had high blood pressure and heart rate and a low oxygen saturation - all symptoms of a pulmonary embolism.

But Miss Parnham-Cope made no checks for an embolism or DVT and instead concentrated on checking Ms Hughes’ injuries from the fall.

After X-rays and an ECG showed no fractures or heart problems Miss Parnham-Cope sent Ms Hughes home with painkillers and a muscle relaxant drug, diazepam - even though her blood-oxygen level was still falling.

Miss Parnham-Jones told the inquest she had not considered DVT or an embolism because Ms Hughes did not complain of leg pain or swelling.

The doctor agreed with assistant coroner Katie Skerrett that the decision to discharge Ms Hughes was ‘wrong.’

'She should have kept Ms Hughes in and reviewed her, looking for signs of low oxygen levels,' she said.

The doctor said she had ‘learnt lessons’ from her mistake and had since received extra training in the recognition and management of blood clots as well as how to cope in a busy department and improve communications.

The inquest heard that within hours of being discharged from A&E that morning Ms Hughes’ condition was worsening and her worried mum took her to the Severn Bank GP Surgery.

There she was seen by locum GP Dr Meenakshi Raina - who decided her symptoms were due to her known conditions of anxiety and asthma and also sent her home.

Practice nurse Lorna Bird said when Ms Hughes came in she ‘looked dreadful, very unwell’ and distressed and was breathing rapidly,

She immediately put her on oxygen while waiting to see the GP, she said.

'My memory is that she said she felt "like I’m dying" or something of that nature.'

Dr Raina said: 'There was no complaint to point me towards pulmonary embolism. She did not complain of pain in the leg or chest pain or coughing up blood all of which were things that would have alerted me to an ambolus.'

The inquest heard that night that Ms Hughes felt so poorly she did not get up from the sofa and spent all night there.

In the morning she was still the same and her son Lee Weldon, 25, who lived with her helped her to the bathroom and then to bed.

He said in a statement that she was feeling hot and complaining of breathlessness, He last saw her alive when he went to bed himself between 11.30pm and midnight - and he found her dead in bed the next morning.

Pathologist Dr Chamia de Cates said Ms Hughes died from bilateral pulmonary embolus caused by a blood clot in a vein of the left calf.

Accident consultant Dr Tom Llewellyn, who led a hospital investigation into the tragedy, said symptoms were ‘overlooked’ by Miss Parnham-Cope and a result appropriate treatment was not given.

She had failed to undertake a thorough and detailed examination considering all symptoms, he said.

This was partly due, he added, to an increasing workload in A&E and also to the absence of a middle grade doctor to assist. Lack of training of nursing staff also played a part.

The assistant coroner said she did not find that the failures amounted to a verdict of neglect.

Instead she recorded a narrative verdict saying: 'The deceased had a history of asthma, panic attacks and anxiety.

'She suffered a DVT causing pulmonary embolus which on the balance of probabilities caused her to fall on 17th December 2012 , causing admission to hospital later that day where the pulmonary embolus went undiagnosed and the deterioration in her condition went unrecognised.'

'She later attended her GP who declined to re-refer her to hospital. taking the view that her head injury had already been investigated and her breathlessness was due to exacerbation of her asthma and anxiety. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she passed away on 19th Dec 2012.'

After the hearing Mrs Woodward said: 'I am not happy. The verdict should have been neglect. My battle starts now because I intend to complain to the doctor’s professional body to get her struck off.

'Miss Parnham-Cope is still working in her £120,000 a year job or whatever it is but my daughter is dead and I am serving a life sentence.

'My daughter had a pulmonary embolism in 2009 and was in hospital for several days so it was a known problem she had. Yet in the inquest the said they could not find any record to show that, which was very convenient for them.

'I was so angry when the consultant was giving evidence that I threw her card back at her. I know I shouldn’t have done but I was so upset to see her there admitting she made a mistake which cost my daughter her life.'

'I assessed Miss Hughes, organised
investigations and subsequently decided Miss Hughes did not need admission.

'I
apologise wholeheartedly that I got your daughter’s diagnosis wrong. I 
have spent the last nine months reviewing with my colleagues in the 
hospital how I could have made such a mistake.'

'I saw Miss Hughes as a trauma patient. As we were very 
busy I focused on rapidly assessing and reviewing patients.

'I saw your 
daughter, made decisions about her injuries and was re-assured as her chest x-ray and shoulder x-ray were normal. I then discharged your daughter.

'I clearly should have been looking in depth at what caused your daughter to be unwell and subsequently fallen downstairs.

'Over
the last nine months I have reviewed what has happened, had additional 
training and looked very closely at how I practice especially when the 
department is busy.

'I can only say sorry and work harder to improve my clinical practice in the future.'
