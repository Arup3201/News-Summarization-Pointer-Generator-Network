Collared: Ronald Gell claimed his dog was behind the wheel when officers arrested him for drink driving

A man who told police his dog had been driving when he was  stopped on suspicion of being drunk at the wheel was yesterday jailed for ten months.

When asked who had been driving the car, 64-year-old Ronald Gell blamed his pet – then assaulted one of the officers.

And when he was taken to the local police station, he refused a compulsory breath test.

At Tain Sheriff Court yesterday, Gell, of Alness, Ross-shire, Scotland, was also banned from the roads for two years.

He faced having his car confiscated, but Fiscal Roderick Urquhart withdrew his motion for forfeiture after receiving an appeal from Gell’s wife not to seize it. Gell had admitted that on February 19 he failed to give information to police as to the identity of the driver of the vehicle.

He was admonished on this charge but jailed for five months for failing to provide a sample of his breath at Dingwall police station.

He also admitted assaulting a female police officer by kicking her from the back seat of a police car as she was driving, endangering those in the vehicle and other road users.

A further five months was added to his sentence.

The court was told that staff at the Co-op store in Alness alerted police when Gell bought a bottle of rum with his groceries and clipped a kerb as he drove out of the car park.

At the first hearing, Mr Urquhart said: ‘It was apparent to the lady at the till he was intoxicated and she became concerned.

‘A supervisor was called and they watched him on CCTV get into a car and drive off.’

Mr Urquhart said Gell mounted a kerb as he set off from the car park. The police were alerted and were on the look-out for him.

By 5.20pm they saw he had arrived home. He added: ‘The car was empty. He was unpacking shopping.

‘When asked to provide the identity of who the driver of the vehicle was he replied “my dog  was driving”.’

The fiscal said there was a confrontation and Gell was arrested.

‘In the police car he kicked out at the driver of the car from the back seat and he had to be restrained for the remainder of the journey.

‘At the police station he refused to provide a sample of his breath.’

Gell admitted previous convictions and his solicitor, Alison Foggo, said he had a substantial number of court disposals and was subject to a live community payback order.

‘He suffers a number of health problems but there are a considerable number of recent breaches of bail orders including him not consuming alcohol,’ she said.

Miss Foggo said Gell had reached the age of 60 before committing his first offence.

‘Now there have been 19 offences in past three years. Alcohol appears to play a very large part in his life, but he does not see it as an enormous problem.

She added: ‘There are signs that he is beginning to recognise his alcohol problem but doesn’t  see himself as an alcoholic.

'His problems seem to be attributed to the fact that he is no longer working and no longer making a useful contribution to society, having worked all his days.

‘He had a heart attack about four years ago, and his health has taken a considerable turn for the worse with his recuperation slow and faltering.

‘My client is bored and needs to realise that enjoyment in life doesn’t come from a bottle.’

Sheriff Gilchrist told Gell: ‘It is very sad to see you in the position that you are in now which is clearly as a result of your consumption of alcohol to excess.’
