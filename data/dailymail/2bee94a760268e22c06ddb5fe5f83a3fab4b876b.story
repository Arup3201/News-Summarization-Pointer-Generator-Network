The pound hit its highest level for nearly three years yesterday, and shares ended 2013 on the front foot in a vote of confidence for the British economy.

The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies rose 17.82 points to 6749.09, taking total gains for the year to £200billion – an increase of around 14 per cent.

The pound also performed well, going up around half a per cent to $1.6565 and €1.2022.

Boost: The pound goes into 2014 at its highest level in almost three years

Rollercoaster: The Footsie edged up another 18 points from 6,731 today to end the year at 6,749.

Sterling is now at its highest level 
against the dollar since April 2011 having clocked up a second year of 
gains – although this could make Britain's exports less competitive.

Last
 year also saw the best London stock market results since 2009, boosting
 the value of pension pots and investments for millions of workers and 
savers.

The stock market and
 the pound benefited from stronger than expected growth throughout 2013,
 as the economy finally emerged from the doldrums.

The
 UK economy looks set to have grown by around 1.5 per cent in 2013 and 
could grow by as much as 3 per cent in 2014, according to analysts. That
 would be the best performance since 2007 when output rose by 3.4 per 
cent before crashing in the recession of 2008 and 2009.

It
 would also put Britain among the best-performing developed economies in
 the world, well ahead of European rivals Germany and France.

The
 brighter outlook – and the sharp fall in unemployment to 7.4 per cent, 
its lowest level since early 2009 – has fuelled speculation that an 
interest rate rise is on the way.

The
 Bank of England has pledged not to raise rates from the current 
all-time low of 0.5 per cent until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or 
lower. Governor Mark Carney has insisted that 7 per cent is a 
'threshold' and not a 'trigger' for an automatic rate hike in a bid to 
dampen expectations.

But the
 surge in the pound – which benefits from higher interest rates – 
suggests many in the financial markets believe a rate hike is coming.

Soaring: The FTSE 250 is up by almost a third this year.

Sterling has jumped from below $1.49 in July when Mr Carney succeeded Lord King as Governor – a rise of more than 10 per cent.

Howard
 Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'After some extended 
gloom, 2013 was a year of mainly positive surprises for the UK economy.'

Mr Archer believes 
unemployment will hit 7 per cent during the second quarter of 2014 and 
could be down to 6.7 per cent by the end of the year. But he played down
 the prospects of a rate hike this year.

He
 said: 'Expectations are mounting that the Bank could start to raise 
interest rates in 2014. However, the Bank will want to give the economy 
as much chance as possible to establish broad-based growth and is more 
likely to hold off from raising interest rates until the first half of 
2015.'

Debenhams issued a profit warning yesterday following a nightmare Christmas which forced it to launch early sales and deep discounts.

Britain's second-biggest department store said profits are expected to be down by 26 per cent in the first half of its financial year to around £85million.

The chain is slashing prices by 70 per cent in its January sale in a desperate attempt to shift leftover Christmas stock.

The news saw the retailer's share price fall more than 10 per cent in early trading yesterday, wiping £140million off its stock market value.

City analysts believe sales in many leading chains were below expectations over the crucial festive trading period.

As a result, shares in the likes of Marks & Spencer, Next, Primark, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all been marked down in recent days. Debenhams' bosses described festive trading as 'extremely difficult' and competitive, with a large number of early sales.

'We did not experience the anticipated final surge in sales in the last week of the period and as a result we expect the need for additional markdown to clear stock in January and February,' they said.

The five-year cost of living squeeze, bad weather and a shift to internet shopping have combined to pile pressure on retailers who rely on their bricks and mortar outlets. Major chains were forced to bring forward sales and bargain promotions ahead of Christmas during what one industry insider described as 'a bit of a bloodbath'.

The gloomy trading update comes just days after reports that Debenhams was under pressure to axe its finance chief, Simon Herrick, amid shareholder concern over his performance.
