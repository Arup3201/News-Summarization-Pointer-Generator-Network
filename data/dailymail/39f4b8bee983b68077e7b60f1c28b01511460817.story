More than three decades after  a bomb ripped through the crowd at Munich's world famous Oktoberfest killing 13 people, German prosecutors have reopened the investigation into the deadly far-right terrorist attack.

Prompted by fresh evidence from a previously unknown female witness, investigators are hoping to shed a new light on the 1980 explosion that also injured 200 revellers at the popular beer festival. 

Intriguingly, they said it may point to previously unknown co-conspirators who may have worked alongside neo-Nazi bomber Gundolf Koehler, a 21-year-old student, who died during the attack. 

Three covered bodies after the bomb attack on the popular German beer festival. Fresh evidence from a new witness may suggest that Koehler had co-conspiators who helped him with the attack 

The new witness said that within hours of the attack she found fliers hailing Koehler as a 'hero of the right' at a home she was teaching at in Silesia. According to a lawyer she spoke to, she told police at the time but they did not follow up 

However, chief prosecutor Harald Range said the investigation would not be limited to the woman's evidence alone, adding that they 'will pursue all leads ... anew and comprehensively' 

'There is no statute of limitations on murder,' he said. 

Detonated in a bin by one of the festival's exit points at the height of the Friday night rush, the improvised explosive made from a hand grenade packed with nails cut a devastating path through the happy drinkers.

Koehler, described by German media at the time as a loner and a gun nut, was known to be a supporter of a neo-Nazi paramilitary group called the Hoffmann Military Sports Group. 

The extreme right-wing militia named after its leader Karl Heinz-Hoffman, was banned by the German government. 

But while the original investigation said their had been indications that others had been involved, prosecutors could find no conclusive evidence to prove this before it was shut down in 1982. 

Nonetheless, many victims, local politicians and lawyers have questioned the 'lone attacker' theory. 

Among them was lawyer, Werner Dietrich who told The New York Times that the case was reopened because of a call he had received from the new witness in September. 

Declining to name her, he told the paper that just hours after the bombing she found fliers lauding Koehler as a 'hero of the right' in a home where she was teaching in Silesia, a region of central Europe located mostly in Poland. 

She had told police at the time but they had not followed up her claims, he said, adding that he had heard a similar story from three or four men who were among the injured. 

Those witnesses said they had seen Koehler arguing with other people before the bomb went off.  

The bombing was the worst terrorist act attributed to the right wing in Germany after 1945, although throughout the 1970s and 1980s Germany saw several far-left terrorist attacks including the murder of prominent public figures and hijackings.
