A retired police dog has been found dead on the side of a northeast Georgia highway.

Authorities say Ranger, who worked for the Barrow County Sheriff's Office, was found dead on Saturday along Georgia Highway 211 after being struck by a vehicle.

A sheriff's spokesman said the black Labrador retriever, who retired eight months ago after serving as a narcotics dog since April 2004, was pronounced dead at a veterinarian clinic.

Authorities tell The Athens Banner-Herald that Ranger had been let into a fenced yard by its owner on Friday, but escaped from the yard.

The brave dog has quite the record in illegal drug detection and was credited with finding $300,000 worth of drugs including 15.5 pounds of cocaine and 3.5 pounds of methamphetamine.

'Ranger will be missed by the Barrow County Sheriff’s Office and mostly by the handlers that were lucky enough to be able to have him as a partner,' said a sheriff’s spokesman.

There will be a funeral for the dog at Oak Rest Pet Gardens at 2691 Harbins Road, Bethlehem at 1 p.m. on March 11.
