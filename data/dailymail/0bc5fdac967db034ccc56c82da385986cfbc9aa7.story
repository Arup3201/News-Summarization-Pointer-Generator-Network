Pervert: Michael Atherton, 42, from Scarborough, was jailed for seven years at York Crown Court today for online sexual offences against women and children

An internet troll who prowled 
Facebook for women and young girls so he could subject them to bouts of 
online ‘flashing’ has been jailed for seven years.

Michael
 Atherton, 42, contacted his victims on the social media network via 
video call app FaceTime, and by email using false profiles before exposing himself to
 them over the web.

Police were called in after a string of victims across Yorkshire and Humberside including a girl aged eight said they had been targeted by Atherton. One woman said she had been pestered on Facebook for years.

Inquiries revealed Atherton had been convicted of similar offences in 2012 after being caught in undercover police sting by an officer posing online as a schoolgirl.

But he escaped jail after claiming his sex drive had been ‘heightened’ as a result of him taking medication for a depressive condition.

Today, Atherton from Scarborough, North Yorks, who is also known as Michael Alderton was labelled a ‘sexual deviant’ by detectives after admitting 17 offences at York Crown Court.

They included six charges of indecent exposure, attempted sexual actity with a child, engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, three charges of breaching of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and two offences under the Crime and Disorder Act.

He was ordered to remain the Sex Offender Register for life.

After the case WDC Michelle Neighbour, of North Yorkshire Police said Atherton’s behaviour highlights the importance of not accepting friend requests via the internet from unknown people.

She added: ‘Michael Atherton persistently engaged in sexual acts using various internet applications.

‘He harassed his victims to satisfy his own sexual gratification. He befriended children and women on Facebook by using false profiles and then contacted them via FaceTime and exposed himself.

‘Michael Atherton is a sexual deviant who will now have a number of years in prison to reflect on his behaviour.

‘He can spend his days thinking about the impact his behaviour has had on his victims and participate in a sex offenders treatment programme, which in turn should teach him how to deal with his sexual desires within the private confines of his own home.’

Atherton was once called a ‘high risk’ to children in 2012 after going onto an internet chatroom and carrying out sexual acts via a webcam, as well as other activity, with a person he believed to be a 12-year-old girl called Lilly.

Unknown to him at the other end of the line was a policewoman posing as a youngster in order to monitor chat-room sites and catch paedophiles abusing it.

During that incident Atherton engaged in a sexual conversation with ‘Lilly’ online, asking her to get friends to also watch him committing a sexual act upon himself and sending her a pornographic photograph involving an eight-year-old girl.

Later when he was arrested the following day, Atherton’s computer equipment was seized and examined, eight further child pornographic images, along with 200 legal adult pornographic pictures, were found.

In September 2012 Atherton admitted child pornography charges but was given a three-year community order with supervision – on condition he get treatment to assist him in controlling his sexual urges involving children.

He was also placed indefinitely under a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, restricting his use of the internet and contact with youngsters under the age of 18, and ordered to be on the Sex Offenders register for five years

But he was arrested again after a woman from the Keighley area of West Yorks went to police saying Atherton had hounded her for 10 years.

She said in a statement: ‘I am glad that I came forward and reported this man to the police. I identified Michael Atherton which assisted the police in linking him to other victims. I believe one of the victims was as young eight-years-old.

‘I am pleased that the investigation is now over and a good sentence was given.

‘Michael Atherton started harassing me from the age of 14 and did not stop for 10 years. He is a pest that never went away and I am glad that I will finally be left alone.’

Another of his victims, a woman from North Lincolnshire whose eight-year-old daughter was also targeted by Atherton, told how monitoring her child’s internet use helped to catch him.

She said: ‘I feel so relieved that justice has been done and he has been put into prison.

‘This shows how the internet should be monitored at all times where your children are involved. Thankfully I do monitor my daughter’s internet activity.’
