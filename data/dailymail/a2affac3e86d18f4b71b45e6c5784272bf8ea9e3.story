Puppy killer Nathan Thompson has spoken out after his court hearing claiming he is a dog lover.

The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty and as a result, has been banned from owning, acquiring, buying or possessing any animal for a decade.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend.

Nathan Thompson, 25, allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Only one of the animals survived (pictured)

'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said.

But he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated.

RSPCA NSW Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy said it was definitely one of the worst animal cruelty incidents he has seen in his career.

'This is a far more significant situation where there is an element of pre-planning and a deliberate attack on the animals,' he said.

Magistrate Caleb Franklin granted Thompson bail to be sentenced on April 28.  

The  25-year-old allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon and bashed a number of them to death with a rock.

Police say an advertisement on Gumtree was placed online last Thursday for the sale of 11 Bull Terrier cross puppies.

Almost a week later, it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25-year-old who accepted. 

It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock, then throwing them into the bush.

The witness confronted the man, who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive. 

The RSPCA were contacted and attended the location, before taking the attacked puppies to a vet. 

Only one of the animals, named Lucky, survived.

David O'Shannessy, told Daily Mail Australia on Friday he was shocked by the incident.

'We deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us,' he said.

'This sort of situation doesn't have to occur.' 

Mr O'Shannessy says by the time the RSPCA arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive.

'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' he said.

'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there.

'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.'

Police and RSPCA arrested the 25-year-old at a house in Kurri Kurri on Thursday. 

Police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed.

'Something's not quite right with the numbers so we've made some inquiries about the other dogs,' Mr O'Shannessy said. 

Lucky, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable and has improved significantly despite serious head injuries.

The clinic has received offers to re-home the puppy, however they are choosing to focus on the puppy's recovery and not get ahead of themselves.
