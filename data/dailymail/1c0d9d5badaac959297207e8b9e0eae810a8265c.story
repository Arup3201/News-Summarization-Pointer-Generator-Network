King Richard III did plan to be buried in York, not Leicester, a new letter unearthed in the National Archives suggests.

The extraordinary letter, discovered by historian and Tory MP Chris Skidmore, provides fresh ammunition to those who believe the King was establishing a major new religious foundation at York Minister with a view to it becoming his mausoleum.

It shows that Richard III wanted the 100 priests at the new foundation to use their prayers to make him ‘more acceptable to God and his saints’.

Writing in tomorrow’s edition of BBC History magazine, Mr Skidmore says the letter, written five months before his death, suggests Richard’s ‘real intention’ in establishing the college at York may have been to follow the 15th Century trend for aristocrats to turn similar foundations into mausoleums.

He says: ‘The connection between Richard’s establishment of the foundation at York and the salvation of his own soul could hardly be any clearer.’

Leicester Cathedral has won the tussle to provide the final resting place for Richard III following a lengthy court battle in which campaigners claimed he wanted to be buried at York Minister,

The case was thrown out, with the High Court ruling there was ‘no public law case’ to interfere with the decision to bury the late King in Leicester, where his bones were found under a car park in 2012.

But the new letter threatens to reopen the debate over whether he should rightly be buried at York Minister.

The document, which has lain undiscovered for centuries, gives a fresh insight into Richard’s decision to establish a 100-strong college of priests at York.

The letter, dated 2 March 1485, records the King angrily demanding that the priests be paid so that they can pray for him.

The King points out to the authorities at the Duchy of Lancaster that the have been given powers to ‘ask, gather and levy all and any sum… to sustain and bear the charge of the finding of a hundred priests now being of our foundation’.

Stressing the personal importance of the issue, he warns he is ‘not willing our said priests to be unpaid of their wages, seeing by their prayers we trust to be made more acceptable to God and his saints’.

Mr Skidmore, author of ‘Bosworth: The Birth of the Tudors,’ said Richard’s comments suggest his intentions at York may have been ‘to follow the growing trend for 15th century aristocrats across Europe to establish their own chantry foundations and, ultimately, mausoleums.’

He told the Daily Mail that the letter was significant because it came at a time when Richard was ‘in a dark place’.

He said: 'This is an intriguing insight into the mind of Richard III, and demonstrates there are still new finds to be made in the archives. 

'At the time of writing the letter, Richard's queen was mortally ill, and would die two weeks later. The king may have been contemplating his own mortality, especially with the growing threat of Henry Tudor who would invade just five months later. 

'It doesn't prove that Richard wished to be buried at York, but it certainly raises interesting questions over the king's own piety and intentions.’

Scientists at the University of Leicester said this skeleton found under Greyfriars car park in Leicester was that of King Richard III

Mr Skidmore said that, despite the discovery, he personally favoured burial of Richard at Leicester on the ‘finders, keepers principle’.

Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. He was buried in a Leicester church, but the building was lost to later development.

His bones were then discovered under a Leicester car park in 2012. Authorities in Leicester have said they will reinter his body with ‘dignity and honour’.

But a campaign group, the Plantagenet Alliance, claimed York was a more suitable location for Richard's remains as he had spent his childhood and much of his adult life in the North.
