Protest: Jamie Kelsey-Fry, a key spokesman for the anti-fracking campaign No Dash For Gas, writes school textbooks on citizenship

One of the leaders of the anti-fracking protest group currently staging an occupation at a shale gas test drilling site earns money writing school textbooks on citizenship, it has emerged.

Jamie Kelsey-Fry, a former teacher and now a key spokesman for the No Dash For Gas campaign, is understood to have helped organise the demonstrations in Balcombe, West Sussex.

The 49-year-old was also involved with the Occupy tented protest outside St Paul’s Cathedral and has been linked with multiple campaigns against capitalism and climate change.

It emerged today Mr Kelsey-Fry is a member of the Association for Citizenship Teaching, an organisation which helps prepare teachers to teach citizenship, a compulsory subject for secondary school pupils.

The charity, founded in 2001, receives nearly £100,000 a year in government funds, which it uses to provide professional development for teachers, to prepare teaching materials and to argue for the subject's importance.

Mr Kelsey-Fry's book on citizenship, the Rax Active Citizenship Toolkit, is published by New Internationalist and was awarded 10 out of 10 in a review by the Times Educational Supplement.

The teachers' magazine wrote of the book: 'The authors have pulled off a remarkable trick here in offering a huge range of interesting and provocative material while maintaining an overall coherence and sense of purpose behind the book as a whole.'

It has been sold by Amazon, Abe Books, Barnes and Noble, Blackwell's, The Book Depository, Waterstones and even WH Smith.

But according to The Sun, Mr Kelsey-Fry urges change 'outside of parliament' by 'direct action and civil disobedience' against an 'unjust system'.

'10 out of 10': Mr Kelsey-Fry's book on citizenship has received a glowing review

Mr Kelsey-Fry lives in a council block in Islington, north London, but he hails from an illustrious family.

His brother John Kelsey-Fry, 56, is a QC who represented shamed former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne at his trial for perverting the course of justice.

The libel and fraud lawyer has been hailed as a legal ‘megastar’ and also represented football manager Harry Redknapp when he was cleared of tax evasion last year.

And their grandfather, Sir William Kelsey-Fry, was a celebrated dental surgeon who won a Military Cross during World War One.

In an article for the New Internationalist magazine, Mr Kelsey-Fry has called the current moves to explore for shale gas beneath the UK 'unbridled coporate greed gone insane.'

He wrote: 'According to our cabinet of millionaires – many of whom have blatant links to the fossil fuel corporations – it seems ‘wiser’ to make a fast buck now and destroy any decent future for our species than it would be to tighten our collective energy belts, make the transition to renewables that last infinitely and ensure a sustainable future for all.'

Mr Kelsey-Fry declined a request to speak with MailOnline.

Crackdown: The number of fracking protesters at the test-drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex, has now dramatically fallen after the heavy police intervention

The Balcombe protests have made headlines in recent weeks thanks to the numbers of demonstrators involved and the famous faces that have joined them.

However drilling is expected to resume within days at the potential fracking site as the numbers of protesters dwindle.

Police made a series of targeted arrests around the camps yesterday after reviewing CCTV evidence of Monday’s protests.

More than eight riot-trained policeman jumped out of a minibus before surrounding one female suspect and quickly driving her away for allegedly earlier assaulting an officer.

Altogether, three people were arrested yesterday, two for offences that happened during Monday’s protests and one for a public disorder offence while a lorry was entering the site.

Three more people were arrested at the site yesterday: A spokesman for No Dash For Gas said the camp is now packing up to leave, but that there would be more protests against fracking in the future

A spokesman for No Dash For Gas told MailOnline they are packing up to leave, as they had always intended.

'Most people will be leaving today,' she said. 'The very last people will be leaving tomorrow. We still have a very constructive relationship with the farmer.

'Our camp was always going to be a six day event, but we can say that many of the people who have been skilled up here will be returning and engaging in peaceful civil disobedience against Cuadrilla.

'The message to Cuadrilla is: This is not over.'

Police have said that the overall operation 
against the anti-fracking protests is expected to cost taxpayers more than £2million.
