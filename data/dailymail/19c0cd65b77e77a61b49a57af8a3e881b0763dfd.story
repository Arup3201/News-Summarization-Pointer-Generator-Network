The U.S. Senate has voted down a bipartisan plan to expand background checks for gun buyers, rejecting the last viable gun control proposal put forward by President Barack Obama after the Newtown school massacre.

The measure failed by a vote of  54-46, six Senators short of the 60-vote hurdle needed for passage.

A furious President Barack
Obama blasted the Senate shortly after the vote. He said it was shameful that a bill 'supported by 90 percent of
Americans' had failed.

Families of Sandy Hook Elementary School victims, who had pushed for tougher gun laws, looked on as the Senate voted down the deal and stood with the Obama for his impassioned Rose Garden speech.

Failed: The bipartisan Manchin-Toomey Amendment was considered President Barack Obama's last hope to pass meaningful gun control legislation after the Newtown school massacre

President's fury: Barack Obama, flanked by wounded Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and the families of other recent mass shootings, blasted the Senate for failing to pass the measure

'A majority of senators voted yes to 
protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks, but 
because of a continued distortion of Senate rules, a minority of 
senators was able to block it from happening,' Obama fumed.

The amendment had been negotiated by Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. It was seen as Obama's best hope to pass 
meaningful gun-control legislation after the December massacre of 20 
children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown.

Obama targeted much of his anger at the National Rifle Association, which lobbied hard against all of the proposed gun control legislation.

'The gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,' he said. 'They claimed that it would create some kind of big brother gun registry. And unfortunately this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose because it upset an intense minority of gun owners.

'There were no coherent arguments as to why they wouldn't do this. It came down to politics, the worry that a vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections.'

Support: Families of the Newtown school shooting stood by the president after the measure failed

Anger: Lori Haas, whose daughter was shot at Virginia Tech, and Patricia Maisch, who knocked a high-capacity magazine from the hand of shooter Jared Lee Loughner as Tuscon, Arizona.

President Barack Obama claimed that '90 percent of Republicans' voted against the background check proposal and '90 percent of Democrats supported it.'

In fact, eight Senators crossed party lines on the vote. Four Republicans voted for the background check. Four Democrats voted against it.

The measure failed by just six votes.

Republicans voting for amendment:

Susan Collins, Maine

Mark Kirk, Illinois

John McCain, Arizona

Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania (sponsor)

Democrats voting against amendment:

Mark Begich, Alaska

Max Baucus, Montana

Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota

Mark Pryor, Arkansas

He concluded by saying: 'All in all, it was a pretty shameful day in Washington.'

Fury erupted from the Senate gallery after the deal failed.

'Shame
on you!' shouted Lori Haas, whose daughter was shot at Virginia Tech, 
and Patricia Maisch, who knocked a high-capacity magazine from the hand 
of shooter Jared Lee Loughner during the Tuscon, Arizona, massacre.

'They
are an embarrassment to this country, that they don’t have any 
compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their 
families,' Maisch shouted as she was removed from the Senate by 
officers.

'I hate them.'

Opponents of the background check proposal hailed the bill's defeat as a victory.

A statement from the NRA restated the group's position that the bill 'would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution.'

Texas Congressman Steve Stockman said that the defeat of the final gun control measure shows that Obama's political power has waned.

'After spending over $1 billion to claw out a 51% re-election, it’s clear at this point Obama couldn’t pass a stone,' he said in a statement.

Staying active: Giffords, who was shot in the head in January 2011, has used her public profile to campaign for tougher gun laws since

Other measures backed by the Democratic president - including a proposal to ban rapid-firing 'assault' weapons like the one used in Connecticut and a limit on ammunition magazines - also are expected to fail as the Senate conducts nine consecutive votes on gun-control legislation.

The votes are the culmination of weeks of intense negotiations and lobbying over Obama's proposed gun restrictions, and the defeat of the background checks amendment could doom the biggest package of gun legislation Congress has considered in two decades.

Opponents of the Manchin-Toomey plan and the restrictions on assault weapons said the proposals were an example of government overreach that would infringe on the constitutional right to bear arms.

The Democratic-led Senate also will consider several Republican-sponsored amendments backed by the National Rifle Association gun lobby that would expand gun rights, adding an element of uncertainty to the eventual content of the bill.

The Senate legislation also includes tighter restrictions on gun trafficking and more funding for school security.

The Manchin-Toomey background checks amendment allowed exemptions for private sales or gifts between families and friends and prohibited the creation of a national registry of guns. Polls show more than 80 percent of Americans support expanded background checks.
