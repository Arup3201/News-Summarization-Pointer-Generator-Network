David Cameron faced strong criticism
from Conservative grandee Lord Tebbit today in the aftermath of Andrew 
Mitchell's resignation as chief whip.

After
the blow of finally losing Mr Mitchell having previously backed him to 
stay, the Prime Minister was said to have allowed 'this dog of a 
coalition Government' to look incompetent.

Lord
Tebbit's criticism came amid reports that Mr Mitchell decided to quit 
after younger Tory MPs from the 2010 intake made clear their hostility 
when parliament returned this week.

Lord Tebbit (left), a cabinet minister from Margaret Thatcher's leadership, has criticised the Prime Minister (right) for allowing the coalition to look incompetent and be called 'a government of unfeeling toffs'

Writing in The Observer, Lord Tebbit - a cabinet minister in Margaret Thatcher's government - said: 'This dog of a coalition government has let itself be given a bad name and now anybody can beat it.

'It has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs. Past governments have had far more real Tory toffs: prime ministers Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Macmillan, or even in Thatcher's day, Whitelaw, Soames, Hailsham, Carrington, Gowrie, Joseph, Avon, Trenchard and plenty more, without incurring similar abuse.'

He added: 'The abiding sin of the government is not that some ministers are rich, but that it seems unable to manage its affairs competently.'

Mr Mitchell finally fell on his sword after admitting that the row over his confrontation with Downing Street police made his position untenable.

After weeks of criticism and speculation over his future, Mr Mitchell said it was not fair to put his colleagues and family through such 'damaging' stories any longer.

Resignation: Andrew Mitchell quit as David Cameron's chief whip exactly a month after losing his temper with police officers for stopping him ride his bicycle out of Downing Street

He insisted in a letter to the Prime 
Minister that he had not referred to an officer on the gate in Downing 
Street as either a 'pleb' or a 'moron' but acknowledged delivering, 
after being told he could not ride his bike through the main gates, the 
parting line: 'I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us.'

He was swiftly replaced as chief whip by Sir George Young.

MPs from across the party have called on Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne to shake up 'the government machine', claiming that too many members of the Downing Street inner circle were 'teenagers' from privileged public school backgrounds with no knowledge of business or executive control.

Criticisms voiced yesterday focused on Cameron's closest advisers, including Ed Llewellyn, his old Etonian chief of staff, as well as the Downing Street communications team.

They claimed the quality-control mechanism in Downing Street was broken, failing to spot potential difficulties and aid Cameron to make the right decisions.

Many MPs blamed Cameron for letting the Mitchell crisis drag on for a month.

A Tory MP told The Sunday Times: 'I feel very strongly that accusations of being out of touch is so right. We need to look at the sort of people who are forming policies - these are not the people who go to Sainsbury's regularly, or understand the cost of childcare. They haven't got a clue. It doesn't help that Cameron and Osborne are both privileged public school boys.'

David Ruffley, a senior member of the Treasury select committee, told the newspaper No 10 needed to 'tighten up the machine' and change personnel.

He said: 'There have been unforced errors made. We can look at the budget, we can look at the rail network. In every case it has been ministers culpable.

'This disgruntlement on the back benches is not just about this Andrew Mitchell resignation. I would expect the prime minister to shore up the government machine.'

The alliance of Tory MPs making up about half of the party which decided Mr Mitchell's fate has been dubbed the 'battle of the tea room'.

Witnesses to the unsettled scenes in the Commons tea room and the 1922 Committee meeting last week said the majority of the 148 MPs elected to Westminster two years ago had 'signed his death warrant' by relinquishing support for the Chief Whip.

According to The Independent On Sunday, one MP recalled 'they hit as a pack', while another said Mr Mitchell 'was trying to be charming but was given the cold shoulder'.

'There was blood on the carpet', said another MP, as Tory Deputy Chief Whip John Randall told MPs that Mr Mitchell had damaged the interests of the party and threatened to resign if the Chief Whip did not. The MP added: 'It was clear then he wouldn't last the week.'

At a union rally in Hyde Park today, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Government remained on the wrong path despite Mr Mitchell's resignation.

Conservative support has fallen to 30 per cent, a drop of five points in 10 days and only one point ahead of the Tories' lowest score since the 2010 election.

According to a Mail On Sunday poll, Ed Miliband's Labour has increased its lead to 13 points on 43 per cent, with Nick Clegg's Lib Dems scoring eight points, four points below the anti-EU UKIP party.

More than one in two voters said Andrew Mitchell should resign as an MP as well as give up his Cabinet seat.

Of those polled by Survation, one in four people who voted Tory at the last election said the conduct of Conservative ministers such as Mr Mitchell made them less likely to vote Conservative next time round.

The poll was conducted in the immediate aftermath of Mr Mitchell's resignation on Friday and controversy over Chancellor George Osborne travelling in a first-class rail carriage with a standard-class ticket.

'Andrew Mitchell may finally have resigned, but the culture of two nations runs right across this government.

'They cut taxes for millionaires, and 
raise taxes for ordinary families. They leave young people out of work 
while the bonuses at the banks carry on.

'They even have a Chancellor of the Exchequer who tries to travel first class on a standard class ticket.

'It's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everybody else: everybody like you who plays their part and does the right thing.'

In spite of Conservative support plummeting to 30 per cent according to a Mail On Sunday poll, Education Secretary Michael Gove insisted that the difficult stories from the past week would not influence voters.

In the Survation poll, one in four people who voted Tory at the last election said the conduct of Conservative ministers such as Mr Mitchell had made them less likely to vote Conservative again at the next election.

Mr Gove told Sky News: 'It's always the case that there are weeks when the headlines are populated by stories that are of interest to the Westminster village and contain an element of human drama, but which for most people are just part of the froth of political life and not central to the concerns which will determine how they vote or how they live their lives.

'The Prime Minister, having made his decision, having recognised that Andrew had done an outstanding job as International Development Secretary, felt that he could continue to do a very good job as Chief Whip and bring to the party some of the knowledge and skill he had deployed in a different ministerial role.'

In his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Mitchell said: 'I have made clear to you - and I give you my categorical assurance again - that I did not, never have, and never would call a police officer a 'pleb' or a 'moron' or used any of the other pejorative descriptions attributed to me.

'The offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark 'I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us'.

'It was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and I am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology.'

Accepting his resignation, Mr Cameron said he was 'sorry' to receive Mr Mitchell's letter but added: 'I understand why you have reached the conclusion that you have, and why you have decided to resign from the Government.

'I regret that this has become necessary, and am very grateful for all you have done, both in Government and in Opposition - as well as for the kind words in your letter.'
