David Cameron today rejected Tory and Lib Dem calls to cut health spending.

The Prime Minister, under pressure from all sides ahead of next week's Budget, bluntly rejected criticism that his promise to protect the NHS from austerity meant there would be deeper cuts to the army, police, business and councils.

Mr Cameron said during a visit to the Mercedes-Benz UK Apprentice Training Academy in Milton Keynes: 'The NHS is not going to be cut by this Government.'

Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have been caught in a pincer movement between Tory right-wing MPs like Liam Fox and Lib Dem minister Vince Cable who today both called for an end to ring-fencing for vast swathes of Whitehall.

Dr Fox called for a three-year freeze in public spending and an end to ring-fencing while Mr Cable warned it created an 'unbalanced approach' to public spending.

But Mr Cameron insisted the health budget would not be touched: 'Plenty of people are giving me advice and there is one piece of advice I won't take and that is the piece of advice that says "You ought to cut the National Health Service budget".

'We made a very clear promise before the last election that yes, we were going to have to take difficult decisions, yes, we were going to have to make some very difficult and painful cuts but we wouldn't cut the NHS budget. I think it's really important for people to know that.

'It's really important for people to know how much I care about it. The NHS was there for me and my family, I want it to be there for other people's families too.'

Mr Cameron said he wanted to make it the ¿new norm¿ for school leavers to take an apprenticeship or go to university

With 10 days to go until the Budget, Mr Osborne faces a bombardment of advice about how to get the economy growing.

He has received calls to slash taxes, boost house-building and encourage wealth creation.

A
year after the disastrous Pasty Tax Budget, which lead to a string of 
embarrassing u-turns on taxing hot snacks, caravans and gifts to 
charity, Mr Osborne knows his credibility is on the line ahead of the 
March 20 statement.

Today Dr
Fox, the former Defence Secretary and a standard bearer for the Tory 
Right, urged the Chancellor to dramatically cut taxes.

Dr Fox said: 'The great socialist coup of the last decade was making wealth an embarrassment. It is not.

'It is the prize for aspiration and hard work, and its side effects are higher tax revenues, more jobs and more investment.'

Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to deliver a major boost to the economy in next week's Budget

In a highly-provocative speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs – with the title The Right Approach for Britain’s Economy – he argued that money is better left ‘in people’s pockets rather than siphoning it off for the Treasury’.

Tens of thousands of new homes should be built to help revive the economy, business groups have warned.

The CBI is calling for 50,000 affordable homes
to be built, incentives for refurbishing empty homes and the housing 
guarantee scheme to be extended to all types of housing.

It wants to shift £2.2billion from current spending to high-growth areas without adding to the deficit.

This would include £1.25billion on capital investment –including housing – and £950m on high-growth business tax measures, such as a 2 per cent cap on the planned increase in business rates and the removal of stamp duty on equity finance for mid-sized companies.

Separately the British Chambers of Commerce is warning today that a point may have to consider major cuts in business taxation and joins with the CBI in calling for 100,000 additional new homes to be built by 2015.

Dr Fox called for capital gains tax to be cut to zero and ‘reintroduced at a more sensible level’.

‘This would create a tax window where businesses that are sitting on assets might be encouraged to sell, investment in capital becomes more attractive and where hundreds of thousands of second homes might come on to the market,’ he said.

And in remarks that put him at odds with David Cameron, Dr Fox also called for the ring-fencing of NHS, schools and foreign aid budgets to be scrapped.

He warned it is a mistake to exempt these areas from the extra cuts the Chancellor will have to make by 2015/16 to balance the books.

However, Downing Street was cool on the ideas, insisting the Prime Minister and Chancellor would 'stick to the course' they have set on deficit reduction.

In an unlikely alliance, the call for an end to ring-fencing has been backed by Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable who denounced it as a ‘very unbalanced approach’ to government spending.

While he said he remained a ‘strong 
supporter’ of protecting the aid budget, Mr Cable suggested the NHS 
ringfence could be narrowed to cover just ‘key areas’.

‘There
is obviously an argument for protecting key priorities, the aid budget 
might be one, the science budget is another – we ringfenced that - 
indeed there are key areas in health which are important,’ he told BBC 
Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘The
problem about ringfencing as an overall approach to policy, is that 
when you have 80 per cent of all government spending that’s ringfenced, 
it means all future pressures then come on things like the army, the 
police, local government, skills and universities, the rest that I’m 
responsible for.

‘So you 
get a very unbalanced approach to public spending. I went along with the
overall ringfencing approach in this Parliament – as part of the 
Coalition we had to work as a team – but I think as a long term approach
to government spending, it isn’t very sensible.’

However, Mr Cable poured cold water on Dr Fox's call for a VAT cut to kick-start growth.

'That is one of the many desirable things that we would love to do if we had more money,' he said. 'We have to do what we can afford.'

Instead he reiterated his call for investment in housing and infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy. 'The priority has now to be to get the economy going,' he said.

He reiterated his call for more extra borrowing to invest in big infrastructure projects.

'The metaphor I’ve used which helps to explain it – there’s a difference between increasing your credit card in order to keep a gas-guzzling car on the road, and taking out a loan in order to get a more fuel-efficient car, and the latter is a more sensible form of borrowing.

'And that’s what, when people talk about capital investment, that’s what we mean.

'Once you start investing in genuine capital projects, of course you generate an income.

'There may be a time lag – it doesn’t increase the deficit, the Government has to borrow temporarily, but it doesn’t do anything to affect the structural deficit.

'Once the economy does get going, you generate more tax revenue, there are less people dependent on public spending and the budget then tends to improve itself.

'I think that's the direction we are going in. My colleagues in government certainly understand that.'

On the run: Mr Osborne must prove he is up the job of Chancellor after last year's disastrous Pasty Tax Budget

In recent weeks Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May had also spoken out against further cuts to their departments.

But Downing Street rejected the latest calls from Dr Fox and Mr Cable.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'The Government receives many Budget representations.

'The Prime Minister has set out the approach that the Government will be taking in his speech last week, which is best summarised as "sticking to the course".

'There will be a 2015/16 budget-setting exercise later this year consistent with the fiscal plans we have set out.'

Mr Cameron's view remains that spending on the NHS, schools and international aid should be 'ring-fenced" from cuts, and that defence equipment budgets should enjoy a real-terms increase of 1% a year from 2015/16 onwards, said the spokesman.

The decision to protect the aid budget from cuts has also been backed by Britain’s leading business figures.

The chief executives of a group of 27 FTSE companies have come together to ‘applaud’ Mr Cameron’s decision.

The
heads of GlaxoSmithKline, BP, Wm Morrison and BT are among the bosses 
to have signed a letter in the Financial Times arguing that protecting 
international aid spending was ‘not only the right thing to do, but a 
smart investment’.

‘Developing
countries become emerging economies and emerging economies became the 
engines of future global growth and prosperity,’ the letter states.
