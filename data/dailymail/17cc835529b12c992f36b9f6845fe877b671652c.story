Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford admits it will be difficult to replace Sir Bradley Wiggins when the former Tour de France winner leaves the squad in April.

Wiggins will begin work with his own cycling team in a bid to secure a fifth Olympic gold on the track at Rio 2016.

The 34-year-old has been with Sky since their launch five years ago and he secured their first Tour victory two years later.

'As soon as you think about trying to replace someone like Bradley, you back yourself into a corner,' said Brailsford.

'His contribution to this team has been phenomenal, absolutely remarkable.

'We set out to win the Tour with a clean, British rider and that's what he did.

'He's an incredible athlete, he's one of the most versatile athletes the sport has ever seen - he can ride on the track, win time trials, win mountain stages.

'That's why we all believe he can be a great athlete even as he comes to the end of his career.'

Wiggins has also set his sights on breaking 'The Hour Record' - riding as far as possible in 60 minutes - but not before trying to seal a first Spring Classic victory for Sky at Paris-Roubaix on April 12.

He finished ninth in the event last year and Brailsford believes a win on the cobbles would complete an already superb career-record.

'If he can win the Paris-Roubaix he'll have one of the most awesome records any rider in this sport has ever had,' Brailsford said.

Wiggins is also a seven-time Olympic medal winner - four of them are golds

'He wants to the do the hour-record and then finish up at the track in the Olympics.

'If he could finish his story where he started out with a medal round his neck in Rio, that would be one hell of an ending.

'And knowing Bradley he'll want to find the next Bradley as well.

'He was given an opportunity and he'll want to give someone else that opportunity, which is a great thing.'

Wiggins' mantle has been take over at Team Sky by Chris Froome, who will be gunning for his second Tour de France crown in July after last year's defence ended with a crash at stage five.

'There's no pressure on him this time and I think that's how we're framing it,' Brailsford said.

'As a team we want to win the Tour for a third time and if we don't we'll try again the next year.

'Chris is in a good place. He's in a better place than I've seen him for a long, long time.

'He had a difficult year last year with his crashes and he's bounced back from that.

'He's hungry, you can tell he's hungry but he's measured. He's in a terrific place.'
