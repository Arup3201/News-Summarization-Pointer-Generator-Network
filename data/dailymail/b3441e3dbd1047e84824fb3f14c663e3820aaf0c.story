Patrick Swayze famously said 'nobody puts Baby in the corner' - but the Dirty Dancing line doesn't appear to apply to the mums who want to see their little girls crowned as the next UK Disco Kid champ.

As their fake orange tans shimmer and the thousands of sequins on their expensive, garishly-coloured costumes sparkle under the bright lights, it could be a Vegas show.

But it is in fact the surreal world of under 10 freestyle disco dancing where girls as young as four and their mums go to huge lengths to achieve glory in this fiercely competitive environment.

In scenes some may find uncomfortable the frenzied crowd whoops and hollers as the gaggle of heavily made up petite dancers push their bodies to the limits as they flip and leap around the dance floor of the famous Blackpool Tower Ballroom.

The child dance scene has been highlighted in a Channel 4 documentary which chronicles the journey of four nine-year-old girls as they battle through a series of heats to try and achieve their dream.

It reveals the girls' rigorous training schedule which involves contorting their small frames into near-impossible positions and performing unbelievable feats of flexibility, stamina and strength for more than six hours a day.

Such is the effort put in by the girls in the documentary that one is shown to collapse in a competition and another appears to be in serious physical discomfort as she takes drags from an asthma inhaler.

Freestyle disco was invented just 23 years ago and is the fastest and most furious form of competitive dancing.The costumes are as vivid and flamboyant as possible and the moves push the dancers to their physical limits.Competitions are held in places as varied as scout huts and nightclub venues.Children as young as four are taking part in the sport which involves performing ever more athletic and flexible maneouvres.

A small girl who faces a wall with her legs spread wide apart lets out a scream of anguish as current UK under 10 champion Cara pushes from behind to try and stretch her a little more.

Dancing teacher Vicki Cooper is shown giving a brutal assessment of the exhausted young girls' efforts. 'Lazy, lazy, lazy' she says pointing at three different children.

The demands of the sport mean the competitors pick up injuries on the path to the top, but for the mums kidney infections, swollen ankles and twisted pelvises will not stop their little prodigies from practicing.

Pauline, mother of Northern Ireland champion Orlaigh, nine, says her daughter regularly gets ill in the run up to competitions. 'I took her to the doctor's and they kept saying that it was stress-related and I was going to them 'but she's nine, how can she possibly be stressed?

'They kept saying that before a child has a competition of any sort it is like an athlete and their adrenalin gets a lot faster than it normally is.'

costumes, the more you stand out'

Preparing for the big day is not just about the dancing it's all about the costume as well. Wigs, feather bowers, false eyelashes and piles of make-up are all tools of the trade for the young dancing queens.

One scene shows Cara from Scotland getting a fake tan in a professional studio ahead of her performance.

Talking about her own attitude to outfits Pauline adds: 'I personally believe in the bigger the better. The more the diamonds on the costumes, the more you stand out.'

'The judges are going to look at you first and they are obviously going to watch you dance then.'

The show also highlights the emotional strain the girls suffer in their battle to be the best and they are shown to break down in tears when their high-octane performances don't achieve the desired result.

The lengths to which parents will go to try and see their little girls win are also depicted in the hour-long documentary.

Tracy says has moved her daughter Billie from Yorkshire to Scotland so she can benefit from a top dance teacher.

She adds: 'I just think it is magical. For any little girl it is a dream. When I was a little girl I played netball which is hardly glamorous. I don't know maybe it is me going back to being a little girl.

The programme has caused quite a stir online website for mums - mumsnet.

One angered parent commented: 'The fake tan made me feel real uncomfortable.' another wrote: 'I actually have less of a problem with the pushy mothers and teachers than I do with the sacriligous treatment of dance.
