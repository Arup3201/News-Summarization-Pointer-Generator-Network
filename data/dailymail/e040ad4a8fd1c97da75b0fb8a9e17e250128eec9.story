Israel has become the world's largest Jewish population centre, overtaking America for the first time.

The total Jewish population of six million in the country carries added significance, as this was the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust.

Census statistics revealed that Israel's total population has reached eight million, with the surge in the Jewish community thought to have been fuelled by returning members of the diaspora.

Growth: Israel's Interior Ministry said that the country's Jewish population had exceeded six million for the first time, overtaking America, which is home to 5.5million Jews

In comparison, America is home to 5.5.million Jews, with two million thought to live in New York alone. 

Comparatively, half a million live in France and approximately 290,000 reside in the UK.

The census figures, announced during the Passover holiday, revealed that the Israel is also home to 1.6million Arabs.

The minority also includes 350,000 non-Arab Christians and another group, members of which have not listed a religion.

Despite the rise in Israel's Jewish population, experts said that the population of those belonging to the religious group is declining on a global scale.

Before the Holocaust, the global Jewish population was estimated at 18 million, whereas now it is believed to be 13.8million.

Professor Sergio Della Pergola, from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said: 'Israel has indeed experienced a growth 
in the number of Jews last year, but world Jewry outside Israel did not 
fare so well.

'On the contrary, world Jewry has experienced negative 
growth.'

Israeli historian Tom Segev told the Daily Telegraph: 'Six million is absolutely a symbolic number but still most Jews live outside Israel.

'But within five, seven or 10 years, you might be able to say that most Jews in the world live inside Israel and it will be legitimate to use the cliché that for the first time in 2,000 years, the Jews are in Israel.

'Then the question will be, what do you do with the Zionist ideology?'

A significant part of Israel's population growth is thought to have centred on Tel Aviv.

A recent report in Haaretz newspaper suggested that 80 percent of Israel’s population will live within the city's greater area bu 2025.
