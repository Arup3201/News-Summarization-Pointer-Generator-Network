The handsome Brazilian accused of being one of the world's worst serial killers has spoken for the first time about his murder spree, chillingly claiming that 'when the thing comes... you have to do it.'

Tiago Henrique Gomes da Rocha, 26, is accused of killing at least 39 people, mostly young women, homeless people and transvestites, during seven terrifying months in Goiania, southeast Brazil.

Most of his victims were allegedly gunned down from a motorbike as the loner, who worked nights as a security guard, cruised the streets of his home city.

The youngest was a 14-year-old schoolgirl who was shot dead as she walked along a road in January, and at least 16 of his victims were women.

The confessed killer chillingly says he was filled with anger, and  'when the thing comes... you have to do it'

Speaking Friday to Brazil's Jornal Nacional news programme on TV Globo, Rocha said he was motivated by 'a great anger' and that killing was the only way to 'get it out of his system.'

He said: 'I tried to do other things to get it out, but they didn't work.'

And he indicated that the number of people he has murdered could be much higher than police investigating the crimes had originally believed.

Claiming he started killing at the age of 22 — three years earlier than detectives had known — he said: 'There could be 41 or so, I can't really remember.'

Rocha said he would choose a victim entirely at random after pondering over murder for 'some days.'

He said: 'The first time I did it I got frightened. But there's no other way is there? When the thing comes and you have to do it.'

Asked what the 'thing' was, he said: 'There's no way of explaining it. It's a really great anger. I would think over it for some days.

'There was no type. Man or woman, that had nothing to do with it. But they had to be people I didn't know.'

Rocha claims he started killing at the age of 22, three years earlier than detectives had known, and added: 'There could be 41 or so (victims), I can't really remember'

Rocha said he had been bullied at school: 'I was quieter than the other kids. I suffered mental and physical aggression.

'I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but these things accumulate inside you.'

He also said he had been sexually abused by a neighbour when he was eleven years old.

He said: 'It was for about a month. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone. I've never told anyone.'

Asked what he felt the morning after a murder, he replied: 'I wasn't happy, no. There was the feeling of regret for what I'd done.'

He added: 'If I have a disease, I'd like to know what it is, and also if there is a cure. I'd like to ask for forgiveness, but I think it's too difficult to ask for forgiveness right now.'

Meanwhile, members of Rocha's family have spoken of their shock at his arrest and televised confession.

His aunt, who didn't want to be named, said she still didn't believe her 'humble and polite' nephew was guilty of the shocking series of murders.

She said: 'He was brought up without a father and as his mother needed to work, his grandparents looked after him. All he did was go out to work and look after his mother. He doesn't have a girlfriend, he's not the type to go out to parties, he doesn't have friends.

'He is a humble and polite person. He finished his schooling, did a course to work as a security guard and got a job.

'I don't think he's guilty. The police are trying to put this on anyone because there is so much pressure from the press and the families of the victims.'

His aunt added that Rocha's 72-year-old grandfather has been rushed to hospital twice in the last few days after suffering anxiety attacks.

'We are all on sedatives. There have been fainting and crying, and no one in the family can face going to work. It's too difficult for us to believe.

'He's a laid back guy, he was working in a good job and sorting his life out. Why would he be killing people for nothing?'

But others who knew him said they were shocked but not surprised.

A married woman who claimed to have had an affair with  Rocha, her neighbour in the Vera Cruz 2 district of Goiania, said that he turned aggressive after she called off the relationship when her husband became suspicious.

She said: 'At the start we had a lot of fun. He even looked after my children at times. While I was with him he didn't show himself to be this monster they're talking about.'

After she put an end to their affair in November 2013, he continued to live for a time in a dwelling at the back of the couple's home.

The woman, who didn't want to give her name, said: 'He would shout and swear, slam the door, and keep looking over at us with a face contorted with rage.

'Some times he would just walk in to our house without being invited.

'There was occasions when I would be looking at myself in the mirror and suddenly I'd see his reflection looking at me.'

A hammer, knives and handcuffs were some of the items seized by the special police task force

One childhood friend who grew up with Rocha and was in the same class as him in school said he was always a quiet and introspective young boy.

The man, who didn't want to be named, said: 'I grew up with him, I'm absolutely horrified.

'He was bullied at school, because he was tall and gangly. Kids on the street called him names because he was lanky and strange.

'We never saw him with a girlfriend. I think all of this was an outlet of everything he was keeping inside.'

On Friday, Rocha's mother also spoke for the first time, telling Brazil's Globo G1 website: 'I'm certain that he is innocent. I and my whole family are devastated.

'It is impossible for us to believe that he could kill even one person. Imagine all of these things they are saying he did.'
