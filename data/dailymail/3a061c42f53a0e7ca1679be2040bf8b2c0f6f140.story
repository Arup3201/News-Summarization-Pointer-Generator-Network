Campaigners claiming to be part of the hacking protest group Anonymous have published contact details of senior English Defence League members online after posting a video vowing to bring down the organisation, it has been reported.

In a video posted on YouTube, the group condemns the EDL for using the death of Drummer Lee Rigby as 'another excuse to further spread your campaign of hate, bigotry, and misinformation' before announcing 'Operation EDL'.

Drummer Rigby was hacked to death near Woolwich barracks in south-east London last Wednesday.

Attack: Protesters claiming to be part of hacking group Anonymous posted this video on YouTube promising to bring down the English Defence League before apparently publishing contact details of members online

A list of what were said to be mobile phone numbers for senior named EDL figures were published online yesterday evening along with addresses of what were said to be donors to the group, the Guardian reported.

Leaked details of hundreds of names and addresses linked to the far-right group that were circulated on the internet in 2010 after hackers broke into one of the organisation's websites were also re-published online yesterday.

One member, Glen Warren, says he has been fielding several calls from 'anti-fascists and Muslims' after his mobile number was published.

He told MailOnline: 'I've had so many people ringing up and threatening me, threatening to rape my mum and kill me.

'It's childish. I'm not even going to go to the police. I spoke to them like an adult.'

The 32-year-old, from Leicester, denied that the group was using Drummer Rigby's death to incite hatred of Islam.

Vitriol: The group condemns the EDL for using the death of Drummer Lee Rigby as an 'another excuse to further spread your campaign of hate, bigotry and misinformation'

He said: 'It's about Muslim extremism. You can't go round beheading people. I think that's why people are getting p***** off.

'I don't class every Muslim the same so why do people class every EDL member the same?'

The video was posted by IWill Object under the title 'A Message from Anonymous UK to the English Defence League'.

The message says: 'We have been 
patiently observing your organisation, as you have inflated, 
indoctrinating our young with your criminal mindset.'

It then describes the EDL as a 'pack of 
raving ignoramuses' before adding: 'Under the guise of national pride, 
you have instigated crimes against the innocent and incited the 
subjugation of Muslims.

'We will not allow your injustices, your lies and your stupidity to further radicalise our youth into fearing and despising their fellow man.'

The warning concludes: 'In this operation, we will begin the systematic and comprehensive decimation of your cult.

'We
 will further expose your falsities and your attempts to censor, to your
 members, to the British public and to the world as a whole.

'You will fall. We can say this with complete confidence.'

Victim: Drummer Lee Rigby was hacked to death near Woolwich barracks in London last Wednesday

About 1,000 protesters joined an EDL march to Downing Street on Monday, chanting 'Muslim killers off our streets' and 'There's only one Lee Rigby' in tribute to the soldier killed in Woolwich last week.

Four men have since the protest been charged with various offences.

A massive police presence kept the demonstrators apart from a smaller group of anti-fascist activists, with officers making 13 arrests in total.

Meanwhile, a group of Muslims have been praised by the Archbishop of York for 'disarming extremist views' after serving tea and biscuits to EDL supporters who protested outside their mosque.

Around six people linked to the far-right group staged a demonstration outside the mosque in Bull Lane, York, on Sunday.

More than 100 members of the mosque had gathered on the premises after learning of the planned protest and invited the group inside to play football with worshippers and have refreshments.

Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu told the BBC: 'Tea, biscuits and football are a great and a typically Yorkshire combination when it comes to disarming hostile and extremist views.'

Imam Abid Salik described the incident as a 'really beautiful thing'.
