It's the sort of racy book that has most readers blushing simply if they are caught with it.

But the steamy Shades of Grey novels have inspired, rather than embarrassed, this amateur dramatic group who performed a sex-themed play in their local village hall after reading it.

The theatre group, from the sleepy village of  Llanrwst, North Wales, wrote and performed a show about their own sexual experiences after reading the bestseller.

Fifty Shades of Shock! The Welsh actresses told all to an eager audience after being inspired by the erotic bestseller

The part-time actresses include a 
mortgage advisor, a medical secretary, a housewife, two teachers, a 
retired grandmother, a Welsh government worker and a hairdresser.

The amateur theatre group usually get an audience of between five and ten people for their plays which they put on in the village hall.

But all 50 tickets were sold for their first show and they have since performed it another three times.

It could be something to do with one of the actresses telling the audience 
how she re-enacted a bondage scene from the racy E.L. James novel which has 
sold 2.3 million copies in the UK.

The show, called Whinging Women, features 13 local women aged between 18 and 65.

Hot under the collar: The actresses have written about their own sexual performances and performed them to their packed village hall

Each of the amateur actresses deliver a short monologue on their sex life as if they are talking to a qualified therapist.

And no topic is off limits - the women
talk about sex toys, their demands in the bedroom and how Shades of 
Grey has boosted their sex lives.

One performer described a shopping 
trip to her local hardware store to buy the same items used by 
billionaire Christian Grey for a bondage session with his submissive 
lover Anastasia Steele in the sexy novel.

She tells the audience: 'I went to the
hardware store and on my list was a metre of rope, a roll of masking 
tape some plastic clips.

So the man went off and I’m getting all hot and bothered thinking he’s going to know why I’m after this.'

Welsh Government worker Rhian Hughes, 47, said: 'I never, ever imagined it would be so popular.

'The theatre has been filled to the brim each night and our first shows sold out in just a couple of days.

'Funnily enough, none of our husbands have been to see it yet.

'But men are more than welcome to come along - perhaps they can learn a thing or two!'

Fifty Shades of Grey has become the fastest-selling adult novel of all time.

The erotic book has already shifted 
2.3 million copies in the UK - in addition to the 15 million copies that
have flown off the shelves in the US and Canada.

British author E L James’s steamy trilogy has been dubbed ‘mummy porn’ due to its steamy plot lines.

The books explore the act of female submission and detail explicit S&M practices.

On the back of its monumental success, sales in sex toys used by the main characters have rocketed by 400 per cent.

And now the novel is set to be adapted for the big screen by The Social Network producers Mike De Luca and Dana Brunetti.

James has said the books offer women a 'holiday from their husbands'.

Cast member Melissa Wilson, 37, a single mum, barmaid and trainee nurse, said: 'Its’s been an absolutely brilliant experience.

'It’s been so liberating to get up on stage with the girls and has given my confidence a real boost.

'I think women coming to watch our show really respond to that.

'The show is a real laugh, but it also
gives us an opportunity to have a voice and to speak openly and 
honestly about our sex lives.'

Now the Stars of the Community amateur 
dramatic group have been 
asked to tour with the show.

Director Craig Ryder, 35, said: 'It’s gone a little bit bonkers. Nothing like this has happened in Llanrwst before.

'We were expecting seven people in the audience but we’ve had 50 people turn up each night.

'Fifty Shades of Grey is the carrot which has helped draw people to our show. It’s really captured women’s imaginations.

'It’s very much an adult show. We’ve given it a PG rating.

'We want it to be a celebration of what it’s like to be a woman to allow them to speak truthfully, openly and honestly.'
