Many people judge themselves harshly against others.

But scientists claim we could better learn to accept ourselves, and ultimately boost our self-confidence, with the help of a virtual reality ‘avatar’.

Experts say that receiving therapy in a virtual reality world, using a computer generated image of yourself, reduces self-criticism and boosts self-compassion and feels of contentment.

They think the tool could one day be used to treat a range of clinical conditions, including depression.

A team of psychologists and computer scientists from University College London (UCL), the University of Barcelona and University of Derby came up with the concept of a self-to-self situation using avatars and computer game technology.

Virtual reality has previously been used to treat psychological disorders including phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder, but this research focused on a new application for promoting emotional well-being.

The study, which was published in Plos One, examined how 43 healthy, but self-critical women, experienced the world through a life-size virtual version of themselves. 

This gave a first person perspective of a virtual room through the eyes of the avatar.

The participants were all trained to express compassion towards a distressed virtual child while in their adult virtual body.

As they talked to the crying child, it appeared to listen and respond positively to their words and gestures.

After a few minutes, 22 of the participants entered the body of the virtual child so they could see their virtual body double deliver their own compassionate words and gestures to themselves.

The remaining 21 participants observed their original virtual adult body express compassion to the child from a third person perspective.

Scientists looked at the participants’ mood and personality traits before and after the experiment.

Professor Mel Slater of UCL and ICREA-University of Barcelona said: ‘When you wear a head-mounted display and look down towards yourself and see a virtual body replacing and moving like your own and also see it in a mirror, this gives a powerful clue to the brain that this is your body.’

Dr Caroline Falconer, also of UCL, said: ‘Women who experienced a first person perspective through the eyes of the virtual child were soothed - they felt safe and content and had increased self-compassion and a lower level of self-criticism.

Scientists think that their virtual reality therapy technique could one day be used to treat a range of clinical conditions, including depression, where sufferers are often very self-critical

‘For these women, we created a unique situation where they can have a kind and reassuring word with themselves.

Excessive self-criticism plays a prominent role in the development and persistence of many mental health problems, including depression.

The scientists said people who are self-compassionate tend to have lower levels of self-criticism and are more able to cope with negative life events because they are more able to cultivate a positive mood.

Professor Chris Brewin of UCL, who lead the study, said the team is now conducting an in-depth clinical study to measure how long the technique’s benefits last in both healthy and depressed people.

‘If positive, we hope virtual reality-based therapy will become a viable, low-cost treatment people can use in their own home - something we believe is achievable using commercial gaming technology,’ he said
