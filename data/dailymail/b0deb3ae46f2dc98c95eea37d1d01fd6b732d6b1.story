A massive swarm of bees managed to ground a Minnesota-bound Allegiant airlines flight after first clouding the windshields and then getting sucked into the plane's engines.

Passengers got a couple more hours in the Las Vegas sun on Monday thanks to the insects, but not before getting a serious in-flight fright.

'It smelled like the whole cabin was on fire,' passenger Misty Newman told WDIO.

Bees on a plane: This Dululth-bound Allegiant airlines flight out of Las Vegas was grounded on Monday when a swarm of bees first clouded the windshield before being sucked into the engines

One passenger described the smell that filled the cabin as sulfury.

Before the scene became too hellish, pilots turned the plane around and landed safely back at McCarran International Airport.

But passengers remained at a loss as to why.

At first they were told it was a bird in the engine.

'When we landed the fire department and the cops were waiting and they took off along the runway after us,' Newman said.

Not until the frightened flyers were ushered onto a new plane was the true reason behind the grounding revealed.

'We thought [the pilot] was joking when he said ,"I've never had that happen before. We hit thousands of bees,"' passenger Cassandra Rogers told WDIO.

The plane taxied into the Duluth airport just two hours behind schedule with no stings reported.Â
