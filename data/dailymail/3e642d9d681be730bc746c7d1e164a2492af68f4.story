Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle has doubled down on her claims that young women should not serve on a jury - and former White House press secretary Dana Perino has incredibly chimed in to support her. 

Guifoyle sparked outrage on Tuesday when she told The Five viewers that 'healthy and hot' young women should be excused from voting booths and juries 'so they can go back on Tinder and Match.com'.

But in a shocking development tonight, her co-host Dana Perino agreed that prosecutors should not pick young women to sit on a jury - as the 45-year-old former Victoria Secret model refused to apologize for her words.

Defiant: Kimberly Guilfoyle appeared on The Five tonight to defend her claim that young women are 'spoon fed' information - and her colleague Dana Perino, former White House Press Secretary, backed up her beliefs

Not backing down: Former Victoria Secret model Guilfoyle and Bush's press secretary Perino were defiant 

'If you're a prosecutor, you typically would not pick the young woman because she is not the person you would want on the jury, and that's true across the board,' declared Perino, America's second ever female White House Press Secretary, who served under George W Bush between  2007 to 2009.

Addressing the storm of backlash, Guilfoyle simply blamed the 'liberal media' for taking her words 'out of context' - repeating: 'if [young women] want to go back to social media or online dating, that's fine with me'.

'I take voting very seriously,' she said, defending her own words. 'Don't come out because you're uninformed or you're spoon-fed information - anybody out there.' 

The panel discussion then turned into an attack on Huffington Post for 'manipulating the truth'. 

'Unfortunately they made that headline then liberal media ran with it when there was not one iota of fact in it,' she raged at her fellow panelists.

Describing the site's news-gathering process as 'twisting a Rubiks cube' of 'manipulation', Greg Gutfeld said: 'It was specifically HuffPo who picked it ... and then liberal media said let's go spread this garbage as far as we can spread it.' 

Guilfoyle insisted that she said nothing about voting. 

'I take the right to vote very seriously, I take the right to serve on a jury very seriously and I think you should be informed when you do both things.'

'My point is you’ve been given a powerful blessing in life in this country to be able to vote and to be able to sit on the jury so come equipped, come prepared because you don’t want to dilute the votes out there because you are uninformed and you’re spoon-fed something that’s inaccurate or you don’t even bother to equip yourself with the facts – anybody out there, this goes for everyone.'

'And that is that': While many expected an apology from the former model, she did not back down on her words

Sit this one out, ladies: Fox News co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle has said on The Five that young women should be excused from voting and siting on juries to pursue online dating on Tinder and Match.com

He said, she said: When co-host Bob Beckel (right) pointed out to Guilfoyle that young women have 'every right in the world' to serve as jurors, Guilfoyle responded by saying they should get a pass 

Refusing to acknowledge the complaints of sexism and hypocrisy that have swarmed Twitter, Guilfoyle then wrapped up the discussion by smiling at the camera defiantly: 'And that is that'.   

Guilfoyle, the ex-wife of former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, appeared on The Five along with her four-co-hosts Tuesday to discuss the challenges the Republican Party has been facing in swaying young women to vote conservative.

When Guilfoyle’s fellow panelist Greg Gutfield suggested that married, older women tend to vote Republican because 'with age comes wisdom,' the 45-year-old former California prosecutor launched into a tirade calling out younger women for their perceived ignorance.

'It’s the same reason why young women on juries are not a good idea. They don’t get it!' Guilfoyle fumed.

She then added that her younger peers don't have the proper 'life experiences' such as raising children, paying bills, or dealing with real-world issues like mortgage, crime and health care, to perform their civic duties.

'They’re like healthy and hot and running around without a care in the world,' said Guilfoyle, a one-time Victoria’s Secret lingerie model.

When The Five co-host Bob Beckel pointed out that young women have 'every right in the world' to sit on a jury, Guilfoyle clarified her point.

In her own words: Ms Guilfoyle addressed the controversy on Twitter and teased an upcoming panel discussion on the subject on The Five

'Condescending': Guilfoyle, pictured here in May at an art benefit, insisted that attractive young women do not have the proper life experiences to make informed decisions

'I just think, excuse them so they can go back on Tinder and Match.com,' the twice-divorced single mother said with a smile.

On Thursday afternoon, Ms Guilfoyle addressed the controversy on Twitter, writing: 'Should young women (or men for that matter) who haven’t studied the issues… cast their vote at the ballot box? That discussion on @TheFive.'

A Fox News spokesperson told MailOnline Ms Guilfoyle will clarify her position on the matter during a panel discussion tonight on Fox News.  

This is not the first time that The Five have taken young Americans to task accusing them of being ill-informed citizens.

Earlier this month, Harris Faulkner urged young voters to sit out the upcoming mid-term elections if they 'don't know the issues,' reported Huffington Post. 

Kimberly Guilfoyle graduated from University of California at Davis and obtained a law degree. While still attending the San Francisco School of Law, she modeled for retailers like Macy’s and appeared in a bridal magazine published by Victoria’s Secret.

First lady: Guilfoyle had married Gavin Newsom (left), a Democrat, who went on to become the mayor of San Francisco . The couple called it quits in 2006

After a decade-long career in law, first as a persecutor and later as a deputy district attorney and assistant district attorney, Guilfoyle changed gears emerging as a TV personality.

Besides her role as a panelist on The Five, Mrs Guilfoyle also co-hosts Fox News’ Outnumbered and appears as a regular contributor on The O'Reilly Factor and Hannity.

While still working as a prosecutor in San Francisco, Guilfoyle married then-city supervisor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who would go on to become mayor and later lieutenant governor of California. Their marriage ended in 2006.

Four months after her divorce was finalized, Guilfoyle tied the knot with a furniture heir with whom she has an 8-year-old son. The two split up in 2009.
