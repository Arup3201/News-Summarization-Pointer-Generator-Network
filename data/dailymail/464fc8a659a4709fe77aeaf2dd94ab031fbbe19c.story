World number one Novak Djokovic's preparations for the US Open suffered another blow after a straight-sets defeat to Tommy Robredo in the third round of the Western & Southern Open.

Djokovic, who looked to be back to his imperious best in winning Wimbledon last month, has struggled with the transition onto the American hard courts and with the final major of the year a little over two weeks away, doubts will be raised as to whether the 27-year-old can make a credible challenge.

He was thumped by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Rogers Cup last week and any thoughts that may have been an aberration vanished following a 7-6 (8/6) 7-5 defeat to 16th-seeded Spaniard Robredo in one hour and 44 minutes.

'Just many, many, many things are not clicking these two weeks on hard courts,' said Djokovic on the ATP Tour website.

'It's unfortunate, but it's more than obvious I'm not playing even close to what I'm supposed to play. I have to keep on working and trying to get better for the US Open.'

The ongoing tournament in Cincinnati is the only Masters title that Djokovic has not won, although he has been a finalist on four occasions.

The opportunity, therefore, to complete a career 'Golden Masters' has been put on hold for another year following Thursday's defeat.

Djokovic was made to toil in a three-set victory over Gilles Simon 24 hours earlier and looked uncomfortable throughout, making 30 unforced errors before limply conceding his serve in the final game to give 32-year-old Robredo victory.

On the stretch: Djokovic form has taken a turn for the worst ahead of the US Open next month
