A landlord who rented out a family home only to discover it had been turned into a cannabis farm by the tenants today accused police of trashing the property when they raided the premises.

Gary Bond, 53, and his wife Rebecca claim the house was cleaner when the cannabis factory was still up.

The garage manager had let the property, in Kings Heath, Birmingham, to a couple believed to be Polish six weeks ago.

But after they failed to pay their rent, Mr Bond entered the house and discovered it was filled with 400 cannabis plants, each potentially worth £1,000.

What a mess: Gary Bond is a disappointed at the state West Midlands Police left his uncle's property in

West Midlands Police kept the property under surveillance overnight but the mystery tenants never returned.

To make matters worse, garage manager Gary and wife Rebecca, 42, from Solihull, were also unhappy with the state police left the property in after they dismantled the factory.

'I was told that the cannabis team would visit the house, hire a skip and sort it all out,' he said.

'But instead, they smashed light bulbs in the back garden, cut the cannabis plants off pot-high leaving the pots behind.

'Fertiliser, smashed plugs and extractor vents were spread around the house.' 

The house belongs to Mr Bond's uncle Terrance, 75, and the money generated from the property's rent pays his nursing home fees. 

Mr Bond said: 'I just want the house let again and in it's current condition it doesn't seem likely any time soon.'

Destruction: Mr and Mrs Bond say the house was cleaner when the cannabis farm was still up

Mr Bond fears he will struggle to pay his uncle's nursing fees now the property is not generating money

Mrs Bond added: 'It was cleaner when the cannabis farm was still up.

'The cannabis gardener was a tidy person as there was washing up done, toiletries in the bathroom and he even had a dustpan and brush.' 

But Sgt O'Keeffe said: 'Cannabis farms need large amounts of fertiliser and irrigation whilst the heat and lighting tends to come from electricity bypassed from mains supply; they are routinely the dirtiest, most dangerous scenes police attend.

'It's almost impossible to dismantle a cannabis factory on this scale without creating some mess.'
