David Cameron and George Osborne are at war over Treasury plans to order savage new cuts in Britain’s Armed Forces.

The dispute, one of the first to erupt between the Downing Street neighbours, has been sparked by fears the Treasury plans to slash another £1billion from the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) budget.

The Chancellor is refusing to guarantee to protect the Armed Forces from cuts after the Election, saying it would undermine his attempts to reduce the UK’s debt.

But the Prime Minister fears it will damage relations with US President Barack Obama, who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other Nato nations by cutting spending.

The row was revealed on the eve of a Tory revolt over defence in the Commons this week. 

Up to 30 Conservative MPs are thought to be backing a bid by John Baron, MP for Basildon and Billericay, to force a protest vote against defence cuts.

It follows controversy over whether Britain will stick to the Nato target of spending two per cent of its gross domestic product on defence. Tory MPs claim that if Mr Osborne gets his way the figure will fall below that level.

And The Mail on Sunday has learned that the Prime Minister shares the rebels’ worries.

‘The stumbling block is Mr Osborne not Mr Cameron,’ said a senior Conservative. ‘Osborne has made it clear the MoD cannot be exempt from cuts. The PM fears it will expose him at Nato meetings, where he has been urging others to stick to two per cent.

‘He will be called a phoney if he isn’t spending it himself.’

One Tory MP said: ‘Mr Cameron has a natural affinity with the Armed Forces. As PM he is constantly talking to generals and visiting troops all over the world. He knows the importance of maintaining our front line strength with Putin and Islamic State causing havoc. ‘But you rarely see Mr Osborne anywhere near a tank or battlefield. He is interested in money, not military matters.’

Mr Cameron secretly visited the SAS headquarters at Hereford last week and is said to have returned more determined than ever to win his trial of strength with the Chancellor.

In a powerful personal plea to Mr Cameron during talks in Washington last month, Obama gave him a blunt warning: maintain UK defence spending or weaken Nato.

He said: ‘If Britain doesn’t spend two per cent on defence, then no one in Europe will.’

But military top brass fear the Treasury will raid another £1billion a year from MoD coffers to try to balance the nation’s books. Defence spending in the UK is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020, even without further cuts.

But Mr Osborne was defended by one influential Tory who said: ‘We have ring-fenced overseas aid, the NHS and schools. If we do the same with the MoD it will mean even bigger cuts elsewhere, such as the Home Office and policing. The Chancellor has to be fair if we are to get out of the red.’

Spokesmen for Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne said there was no rift.

NO WONDER PUTIN FEELS FREE TO BUZZ BRITAIN WITH HIS BOMBERS

by John Baron, ex-soldier, MP and member of Defence Select Committee.

At this time of mounting global uncertainty, Britain needs a strong defence to deter potential aggressors.

Last week we learned that Raymond Odierno, the top general in the US Army, is ‘very concerned’ by the falling levels of our defence spending – and even suggested that British brigades might have to operate within US divisions on future operations.

This should certainly make us pause for thought.

As a bare minimum, Britain must abide by its Nato commitment to spend two per cent of GDP on defence.

We are hovering around this figure and forecasts suggest we will shortly fall below the threshold. This would be a grave mistake.

Maintaining a capable military can do much to prevent conflict, as Nato proved throughout the Cold War.

Britain needs to remain a global power to protect our strategic interests and support our alliances. We require Armed Forces of sufficient capability and capacity to respond to any challenge – including the ability to act in an independent, sovereign manner.

In addition, a successful foreign policy is underpinned by the heft of a strong and well-resourced military. A shrinking defence budget threatens our ability to lead global opinion, reduces our foreign policy options and sends the wrong message to both allies and potential adversaries alike. Yet the Coalition continues to make cuts, as starkly demonstrated by the decision to replace 20,000 Army regulars with 30,000 reservists.

The Royal Navy has been reduced to 19 surface ships. The last strategic defence review suggested a minimum of 30. The scrapping of the RAF’s venerable Nimrod means we are without a maritime patrol aircraft.

No wonder the Russians feel they have free rein to fly their bombers and position their submarines around our coasts.

Westminster is becoming increasingly impatient. On Thursday, MPs from all sides of the Commons will support my debate demanding that the Government should meet Britain’s Nato commitment.

The first duty of Government is the defence of the realm. We ignore history at our peril.
