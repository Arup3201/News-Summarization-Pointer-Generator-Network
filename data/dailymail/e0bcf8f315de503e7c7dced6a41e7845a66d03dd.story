A bipolar American man has denounced the United States at a press conference after apparently successfully swimming to North Korea on his second attempt to cross illegally into the country.

Speaking at the event in Pyongyang on Sunday, Arturo Martinez, 29, who was raised in El Paso, Texas, claimed he managed to enter North Korea by swimming across the river border with China.

According to his mother, it is the second time he has attempted to enter the country - he was previously stopped and shipped back to the U.S. after he was caught swimming across the water.

Addressing reporters, Martinez said he undertook the 'risky journey' to North Korea 'so I can pass along some very valuable and disturbing information' on America's domestic and foreign policy.

'I would like to reveal some facts about America's imperalistic influence and dominance, as well as much of its corrupt and threatening practices through which it has proven itself to have little or no regard for human rights or serving the greater good,' he said.

But he added: 'I would like to offer a sincere apology to the leadership of the DPRK for knowingly having violated its nation's laws and boundaries by illegally entering as I did in such a foolish way.'

He also said he was 'extremely grateful' for 'the  generous reception' he has received in North Korea.

Martinez has apparently not been put into custody and is currently seeking asylum in Venezuela.

Following the U.S. citizen's first attempt to enter the country, he was placed in a California psychiatric hospital, CNN reported. However, he was later approved for release by a judge.

'He is very smart and he got the court to let him out and instead of coming home to us he bought a ticket and left for China. He took out a payday loan online and left,' his mother, Patricia Martinez, said.

She added that the U.S. Embassy in Beijing was looking for her son, whom she described as 'mentally unstable' and a sufferer of bipolar disorder. 

Details of Martinez's latest attempt to enter North Korea - including how and when he got into the country - were not immediately clear..

In September, South Korean media reported that a man in his late 20s had been arrested by South Korean marines for swimming in a river that flows towards North Korea.

The man had been trying to go to the North to meet its leader, local media reported at the time. 

Martinez made his comments at the People's Palace of Culture, which North Korean officials have used in recent years to present North Korean defectors who have returned there.

On at least one occasion, they have also presented a South Korean citizen who was detained in North Korea.

The Palace is also used for signing ceremonies between North Korea and other countries.

Martinez's comments came amid North Korea's own  protests of a resolution in the UN that could open the door for its leaders to face charges of crimes against humanity for human rights violations.

This raises questions of whether Martinez was trotted out to the media for propaganda purposes.

North Korea recently released three Americans - two who had entered the country on tourist visas and Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary who had been convicted of "anti-state" crimes.
