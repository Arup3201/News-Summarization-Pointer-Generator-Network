Felix Magath's chaotic first days in charge of Fulham will end with confirmation that Alan Curbishley and Ray Wilkins are to be dismissed.

Curbishley was told he would be fired after a short meeting at the club's Motspur Park training centre on Monday morning and Wilkins' fate was sealed later in the afternoon.

Fellow Fulham coaches John Hill and Mick Priest have also been relieved of their duties, while Magath was pictured at Fulham under-21s' 3-1 loss to Leicester with long-term allies bernd Hollerbach and Wener Leuthard.

Bernd Hollerbach is a coach who joined up with Magath's Wolfsburg side in 2007 before following him to Schalke.

Werner Leuthard has been with Magath even longer, serving as fitness coach at Bayern Munich from 2004 and joining Magath's team at Wolfsburg and Schalke.

Incredibly head coach Rene 
Meulensteen, who has been deposed by Magath, is still agonising over a 
decision to return to Fulham to work alongside the German manager.

League
 Manager’s Association chief executive Richard Bevan has been attempting
 to mediate after Meulensteen believed he had been fired on Friday 
night.

Remarkably Fulham 
seemed to think they can somehow persuade the former Manchester United 
coach to remain at the club and work alongside their new German manager.

Curbishley
 feels embarrassed and humiliated by chief executive Alistair Mackintosh
 after he was persuaded to take on the role of technical director in a 
Christmas Eve shake-up at the club.

The
 former Charlton and West Ham manager, a popular and highly-respected 
figure in the game, has been at Fulham for just over three months.

Despite
 his huge experience within the game, Magath believes they cannot work 
together as Fulham battle to escape relegation from the bottom of the 
Barclays Premier League.

Replaced: Fulham moved to replace Rene Meulensteen with Magath as they seek to climb away from the foot of the Premier League table

Wilkins
 has similar respect in the game, but he was ordered away from the 
Fulham training ground by Mackintosh and spent the day
 at home.

Behind the scenes 
Fulham were attempting to come to a compromise agreement after their 
disastrous handling of the situation developing at Craven Cottage.

The
 clumsy leadership structure at Fulham has also been highlighted after a
 series of rows involving coaching staff and players during their slump 
to the bottom of the Barclays Premier League.

Tensions
 were so high at the training ground and in the dressing room that it 
has threatened to spill over before Fulham took the dramatic decision to
 replace their Dutch head head coach.

Brede
 Hangeland and Rene Meulensteen were involved in spectacular row after 
the central defender was axed from the team who drew 2-2 at Manchester 
United.

Hangeland paid the 
price for a diabolical performance in the 1-0 defeat at home to 
Sheffield United in the FA Cup fourth round on February 4.

Meulensteen decided to drop him for the trip to Old Trafford and replaced him with rookie centre half Dan Burn.

Hangeland
 was livid with the decision and although he was named as a substitute, 
he was involved in a heated confrontation with the club’s head coach 
following the decision. Hangeland has claimed there was no disagreement.

Right-back
 Sascha Riether, who signed for the club permanently in the summer following a successful season long loan spell, was also 
involved in a training ground bust-up with midfielder Scott Parker in the 
head coach’s final days in charge.

It’s
 understood that a row between the pair escalated over a training ground
 tackle, but it did not result in a physical confrontation.

Despite
 the obvious problems on the field, Fulham’s players liked Meulensteen 
and had respect for his attempts to change the culture of the club.

But
 that does not hide the fact that they are bottom of the Premier League 
and have just 12 games to avoid relegation to the SkyBet Championship.

They have not won in the Premier League since January 1, when they beat West Ham 2-1.

Fulham’s
 next clash is with relegation threatened West Brom at the weekend and 
then head into the west London derby with Chelsea the following week.

However, there was one bright note of Fulham U21s' loss, as January signing Kostas Mitroglou completed his first ninety minutes for his new side.
