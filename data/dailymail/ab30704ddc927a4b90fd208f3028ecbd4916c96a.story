At least three top Hillary Clinton aides used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state's private server while she was in office, according to reports from two different news outlets.

A conservative magazine reported Wednesday that Clinton's State Department chief and deputy chief of staff both had the private addresses.

'Two of Hillary Clinton's top aides used personal email while they were employed at the State Department,' Weekly Standard senior writer Stephen Hayes said in a Fox News Channel interview, naming 'Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's chief of staff.'

'The State Department has evidence of this,' Hayes claimed.

Clinton has come under fire for exclusively using her own 'clintonemail.com' address while she was America's top diplomat. 

She admitted Tuesday during a news conference at the United Nations that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job. 

Separately from claims by The Weekly Standard, the gossip website Gawker reported this month that Abedin and Phillippe Reines, Clinton's top communications strategist, had the private addresses. Abedin married into a separate scandal when she wed former congressman Anthony Weiner, whose sexting exploits landed him on front pages and hastened his departure from Congress.

Daily Mail Online was able to confirm Abedin's email address through Lexis-Nexis, a commercial service that compiles public records.

'Huma@clintonemail.com' was one of several of Abedin's email addresses Nexis collected in conjunction with other public records.

Email addresses typically land in the Nexis database when people list them on credit applications, mortgage paperwork or other legal documents.

Cheryl Mills (left) was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department and reportedly used an off-the-books email address to trade messages with the then-secretary of state, potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators

Searches for similar email addresses belonging to Reines and Mills were unsuccessful, as were searches for email addresses belonging to current and former State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, Jen Psaki and Marie Harf, along with current Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill.

Merrill told Gawker this month that Reines 'has never had' an email address on the private Clinton server, 'not for communicating with anyone about anything.'

But Merrill wouldn't say whether Reines used a separate private account to conduct government business with Clinton.

Hayes said Tuesday that 'the question, I think becomes: Were they emailing with Hillary Clinton from their personal email addresses to her personal email address about State Department business, about Benghazi, including sensitive classified information?'

'Those are questions that I think that Trey Gowdy and the House Benghazi Committee is going to want to look at very carefully.'

Rep. Gowdy is a former South Carolina prosecutor now in charge of a congressional inquest into the deaths of three Americans during a 2012 terror attack on a diplomatic station in Benghazi, Libya.

Clinton acknowledged Tuesday that she deleted more than 30,000 'personal' emails but insisted she first gave everything work-related to the State Department for inspection

Her first public words about 'email-gate' attracted a crush of reporters at the United Nations

Clinton's State Department was criticized in the attack's aftermath for interfering with CIA talking points which originally made it clear a specific Islamic militant group, Ansar-al-Shariah, was responsible for the bloodshed, which claimed the lives of two security personnel and Ambassador Chris Stevens.

At the time, the White House and Clinton personally maintained that a spontaneous protest over a crude anti-Muslim Internet video had spiraled out of control, sparking a riot.

Now congressional Republicans want to know if all of Clinton's work-related emails, hosted not on a secure government computer but on a server she personally kept at her Chappaqua, New York home, have been archived as federal law requires.

Clinton claimed Tuesday during a contentious press conference, her first on the subject, that when she exchanged emails with staff members who did use official 'state.gov' email addresses, the government archived the messages from the recipients' end of the conversations.

But if staffers were using 'clintonemail.com' addresses for sensitive work, including messages about the Benghazi attack, the State Department would have no record of them and Gowdy's efforts to demand them could be meaningless.

'This is the key point,' Hayes said Wednesday.

'Yesterday, she said, "Look, when I was doing State Department business I was emailing to people who on the receiving end of her emails had .gov email addresses and therefore the emails, the documents would have been retained",' Hayes recounted.

'What this suggests is that others were using non-.gov emails, their personal emails, and if they communicated with her in that manner those emails with her will be lost unless they're compelled to provide them.'

It's unclear if the messages still exist, however. Clinton conceded Tuesday that she had deleted more than half of her own emails, but did not say if staffers and advisers who shared her server did the same.

Gowdy seemed to agree with Hayes, saying Tuesday on CNN that emails sent to a '.gov' address 'would be captured by the .gov server.'

'But if you're talking to people private-to-private that will never be captured.'

He said his committee would 'seek any private email that relates to official business, and I don't care about wedding cakes, but any work that could have been done on private-to-private accounts for those State Department employees we know had private accounts.'

Earlier in the morning on MSNBC, Gowdy demanded that Clinton allow an outside arbiter to examine the email server to determine what deleted information might be salvaged and who was using it.

'I think it's eminently reasonable to ask someone to turn the server over to an independent, neutral third-party,' he said, 'not to the House of Representatives.'

'Turn it over to a retired judge, an archivist, an inspector general, so that we can have some assurance,' he said.
