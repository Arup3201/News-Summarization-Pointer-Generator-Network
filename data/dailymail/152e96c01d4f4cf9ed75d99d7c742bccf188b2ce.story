Andre Ward has hinted he has no plans to cross the Atlantic for a potential rematch against Carl Froch.

Both men hold different versions of the WBA super-middleweight title and have been ordered to fight by the organisation.

Froch called on Ward to travel outside of America for the first time in his career and face him at Nottingham Forest's City Ground.

The Cobra called on Ward to 'travel out of his comfort zone' but the American is proving difficult to convince

But the unbeaten Californian tweeted: 'Looks like Frochy Froch remembered my name all of a sudden. That's good to know. Looks like the old man is still kicking.

'Froch could have gotten this fight years ago, but it took the WBA mandating the fight for him to step up. SMH (Shaking my head). This guy.

'If this fight does happen, Froch is not dictating anything. He must have fell and bumped his head.'

Ward has fought just twice since he comprehensively outpointed Froch in Atlantic City in 2011.

And the Cobra said earlier this week: '‘I fought him in the US. Now it’s only right that he comes over here. To be a truly great champion you have to box overseas.

'Ward needs to be forced to travel out of his comfort zone.

'I dare him. He will discover that I’m a very different animal here than I was that night on the Boardwalk.'

The two men have until the beginning of April to agree a deal before purse bids are ordered with the fight taking place within 120 days.
