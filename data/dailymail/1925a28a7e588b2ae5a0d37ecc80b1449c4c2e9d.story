Teetering along a highwire suspended between two skyscrapers 185 metres up is really not a good the place to be afraid of heights.

But Austrian daredevil Reinhard Kleindl, pictured here attempting to set a new world record for 'urban highlining' above the German city of Frankfurt, admitted he suffers from just that.

Mr Kleindl, 32, used only his arms to balance as he walked twice along a 30-metre-long polyester rope anchored to the two wings of the city's U-shaped skyscraper Tower 185 above hundreds of cheering supporters.

Kleindl said he was trying to set a new 
record for walking the highest urban highline, but no one was 
immediately available from the World Slackline Federation to confirm if 
this was a new record.

According to Kleindl, the previous record was set by a group of French adrenaline junkies on a line about 120 metres above the ground, between the Les Mercuriales twin towers in Paris, two years ago.

Unlike tightropes, slacklines are not held rigidly taut, making it harder to balance.

After completing his walks, Kleindl whooped with joy and admitted he was afraid of heights.

'The effect of the height was worse 
than I had expected. The straight lines of the building just seem to 
drop down into infinity,' said the long-haired and bearded Austrian.

Kleindl,
 who studied particle physics before becoming a professional slackliner,
 was due to repeat his walk three times during a two-day 
skyscraper-themed festival that started on Saturday.

Hundred of thousands of visitors are expected at the event. Highlights are spectacular performances in the air and numerous concerts.
