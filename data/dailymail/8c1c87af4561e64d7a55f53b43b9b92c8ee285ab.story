A man who appeared to be the homeowner was also taken to a local hospital. But his injuries are unknown.

Neighbors said that they did not know that the owner had so many dogs living in the house.

A neighbor told KLAS-TV: 'Everyone thought that they only had about ten dogs - but they had, like, 90.' 

'We saw the [firefighters] with them on the floor and they were giving them oxygen,' he added.

'It was kind of sad [to see the animals being rescued] because they were all burnt, not fully burnt, but dark.'

Eyewitnesses described the firefighters carrying out multiple rescues from the house in an attempt to save the dogs.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
