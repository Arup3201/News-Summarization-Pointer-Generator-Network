Boston firefighters gathered Thursday at Logan Airport to meet the family of a fallen comrade in an emotional show of respect and gratitude.

Massachusetts Port Authority Fire Department members waited silently outside the gate of a flight escorting Lt. Edward Walsh’s mother. He was one of two firefighters who died earlier in the week while trying to tame a blaze in the city’s Back Bay neighborhood.

The picture was taken by Max Widmer as he waited to board his plane and the firemen waited for the JetBlue flight that carried her to Beantown free of charge, according to WCVB.

Walsh, 43, and a married father of three children, was trapped Wednesday in the basement after a window broke in the building and allowed high winds to intensify the flames, according to the Boston Globe.

‘We’re in the basement, please come and get us,’ either he or Michael Kennedy, 33, shouted frantically into their radio.

The winds fanned the flames to the point all firefighters were ordered to evacuate as the fire reached its seventh alarm.

‘In 30 years, I’ve never seen a fire travel that fast, escalate that quickly, and cause such havoc,’ Deputy Fire Chief Joseph Finn told the Globe.

The call came over the radio to get out and stay out.

‘No companies should be going in anywhere; stay away from the building,’ was the order over the radio.

Some insisted they were going back in to save the two men, but they were ordered to stand down.

Walsh and Kennedy never made it out of the basement, but their actions were credited with saving the lives of residents on the upper floors.

‘These two heroes ran into a burning building and got people out,’ Mayor Martin Walsh (no relation) said at a press conference that evening, according to the Globe.

‘A day like today makes us all too aware of what they are risking in the course of doing their jobs,’ he continued. ‘They are heroes simply by virtue of accepting this duty.’

The inferno eventually reached nine alarms before MassPort and Boston Fire Department firefighters were able to bring it under control.

Memorial funds have been set up in their names since the tragedy.

Their funerals are set to be held in the coming days.

The building burned to the ground, but the two men were the only deaths. The fire has preliminarily been ruled an accident.
