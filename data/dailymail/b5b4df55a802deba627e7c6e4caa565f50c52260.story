Gael Clichy has shown he's not just a gifted footballer during Manchester City's pre-season tour.

The 28-year-old was captured by the club's official vine page demonstrating his table tennis skills as the squad unwound ahead of their pre-season friendly against Dundee.

The full-back was omitted from France's 
World Cup squad by coach Didier Deschamps and it seems he may have spent
 some time finessing his racket techniques during his summer vacation.
