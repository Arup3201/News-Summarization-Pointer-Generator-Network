Sarah Palin strongly rebuked President Barack Obama on Monday for trading known terrorists for accused military deserter Bowe Bergdahl.

Palin,
 an increasingly outspoken critic of the president's ability to 
effectively carry out his duties as Commander in Chief of the nation's 
armed services, said the president's actions 'just destroyed troop 
morale.'

'You blew it again, Barack Obama,' the former Republican vice presidential candidate said in a Facebook post on Monday afternoon, 'by negotiating away any leverage against the bad guys as these bad guys
 – Osama Bin Laden's partners in evil crime – joyfully celebrate their 
"win" in the deal you sealed.'

Fresh off of claims that Barack Obama a 'weak' president who doesn't understand 'the mission of the military,' former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin criticized Obama for trading terrorists for American solider Bowe Bergdahl, who may have deserted the military just before he was captured by Taliban forces five years ago

Palin is among those who believe that Bergdahl was trying to desert the Army when he was captured by Taliban forces five years ago.

It's unknown whether Bergdahl actually abandoned the military but its clear he voluntarily left his post in Afghanistan on the day in question.

On Saturday the Taliban released Bergdahl, the last known U.S. solider in captivity, to U.S. Special Forces in exchange for five enemy combatants being held at Guantanamo Bay. At least one of the detainees the U.S. agreed to swap for Bergdahl was tied to bin Laden.

President Obama formally announced Bergdahl's release at a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House on Saturday evening. He was accompanied on stage by Bergdahl's mother Jani and his father Bob.

The U.S. 'made an ironclad commitment to bring our prisoners of war home,' Obama said. 'It’s 
who we are as Americans.

'Today, at least in this instance, 
it’s a promise we’ve been able to keep.'

President Barack Obama formally announced the release of Bowe Bergdahl on Saturday in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by Bergdahl's mother Jani Bergdahl, left, and father Bob Bergdahl, right. Obama said Saturday that making sure no man is left behind is 'who we are as Americans.'

Responding to National Security Adviser Susan Rice's claim on ABC yesterday that Bergdahl 'served the United States with honor and distinction,' Palin shared on her Facebook today a link to an article in the New York Post that included details of an email Bergdahl sent his parents days before he was captured.

'I am ashamed to be an American. And the title of US soldier is just 
the lie of fools,' he said in the email. 'I am sorry for everything. The horror 
that is America is disgusting.'

Palin latched onto the email as proof that Obama shouldn't have handed over suspected terrorists to the Taliban to get Bergdahl released.

'No, Mr. President, a soldier expressing horrid anti-American beliefs – 
even boldly putting them in writing and unabashedly firing off his 
messages while in uniform, just three days before he left his unit on 
foot – is not "honorable service." ' Palin wrote. 'Unless that is your 
standard.'

Instead of praising Bergdahl, Palin said, Obama should be praising the soldiers who died looking for him.

'Praise
 the soldiers who fought with everything they had to defeat Islamic 
terrorists, those whom you just freed from prison,' Palin said.

'Our men gave all. Our
 surviving combat vets will forever live with the effects of the 
missions they willingly engaged in to protect you, our country, and 
certainly their brothers and sisters who are proud to wear the uniform.'

Palin's scathing Facebook post comes on the heels of comments she made last week on Fox News about the president's handling of the Veterans Affairs scandal.

During an interview with Sean Hannity, Palin called Obama 'weak' and accused him of undervaluing the service of the nation's men and women in uniform.

'I think there's a lack of understanding on our
Commander in Chief's part on what the mission of the military is and why we owe
a debt of gratitude that's manifested in benefits paid to those who have
already earned them,' she said.
