'Sneaking out for golf before all wake up,' this man posted

One young guy's justification for taking the shot was complete boredom.

'I just take weird pictures when I'm bored, I don't know man.' the post said.

Another young man labelled the craze 'Drifie' and his friend replied with 'Carfie!!!' 

A young girl seemed like she was taking a selfie just before going for her driver's licence with a photo of her looking nervous along with the hashtags '#holy shite #sonotready'.

The hashtag craze has prompted the NSW government to run a 'Get Your Hands Off It' advertising campaign featuring a young driver taking a selfie of his coffee while driving in rural NSW, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Assistant Police Commissioner John Hartley said there have been recent two fatalities recently involving young drivers on phones. 

'Our message is a simple one – if your phone is not in an approved cradle, don't use it,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald.

Another middle-aged man wanted to let every one know he had snuck out for a game of golf while his family was still sleeping.
