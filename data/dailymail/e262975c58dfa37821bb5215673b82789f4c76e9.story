More than 2,500 people have been left stranded during flash floods and mudslides in California – including 500 children and adults at a Christian campsite.

Around 1,500 residents of Oak Glen and another 1,000 residents at Forest Falls in the San Bernardino Mountains have been cut off amid torrential rainfall in southern California.

Hundreds of youngsters and adults are unable to get out of a mountain campground in Forest Falls after roads in the area were covered with mud, rock and debris.

Fierce storms have already claimed the life of one person after a car was swept into a rain-swollen creek in Mount Baldy and overturned, San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Chris Prater said. 

Bulldozers have already been used to try and reach the campground in a bid to rescue the Forest Fall campers, who arrived on Sunday morning.

Kyle Hauducoeur, from the county fire department, said: 'Our concern is that they're isolated at that campground and no longer have access out of the mountain.'

Authorities made reverse 911 calls to urge residents to stay put while crews attempt to clear the roads.

Amateur footage has emerged of dry land at Forest Falls quickly turning into a rampaging river of flood water in the wake of a fierce thunderstorm.

Within seconds, water comes crashing down a valley, taking logs and boulders with it.

Many routes are 'impassable' with thick debris flows cutting off access to mountain communities in the area.

Some roads are covered with up to eight foot of rock, creating arduous conditions for emergency crews.

Several people have already been dramatically rescued during the flash floods.

Mr
 Hauducouer said a woman in Mt. Baldy was rescued from her house before 
it was buried in mud while four other homes in the Bear Creek area were 
damaged by the debris flow.

Near
 Mount Baldy, a group of five hikers and a dog were airlifted to safety,
 according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokeswoman said.

Monsoonal moisture has brought brief but fierce storms to mountain, desert and inland areas. 

In and around Palm Springs, knee-deep water flooded city streets and stranded vehicles. 

In the city of Redlands, the storm downed a tree and caused power black-outs in a number of communities.

Officials have asked residents to stay inside their homes and call emergency services if they need to be rescued. Two 'swift-water rescue crews' have been put on alert in the area.

The downpour dumped as much as 3.5 ins of rain on Forest Falls, and nearly 5 ins of rain on Mount Baldy, the National Weather Service said.

Around 1,500 residents of Oak Glen and 1,000 at Forest Falls, both outside San Bernardino, have been cut off. The areas are around 50 miles from Los Angeles
