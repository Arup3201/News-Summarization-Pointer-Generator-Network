New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio admitted at a news conference on Wednesday that more could have been done to help residents living in the Upper East Side during Tuesday's snow storm

New York mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged on Wednesday evening that there were flaws in his administrations response to the snowstorm which descended on the city on Tuesday causing transport chaos on the city’s roads.

Facing one of the first flashpoints of his weeks-old tenure, de Blasio initially defended what he called a ‘coordinated, intense, citywide response’ to a storm he said caused a worse-than-expected headache when it ramped up at rush hour.

De Blasio, who campaigned on closing the gaps between rich and poor city residents, at first rebuffed complaints that the effort had lagged on Manhattan's posh Upper East Side, saying ‘no one was treated differently.’

But he backtracked on Wednesday evening, saying he'd determined ‘more could have been done to serve the Upper East Side.’

Thirty more vehicles and nearly 40 more sanitation workers were sent to the area to finish the cleanup, de Blasio said in a statement that noted he still felt the citywide response, overall, ‘was well-executed.’

In a city where snow removal has proven a political hot potato, the flap was almost a mirror image of complaints about how de Blasio's predecessor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, handled a 2010 blizzard.

The Mayor's Office tweeted this photo of de Blasio out and about in the Upper East Side on Wednesday

Bloomberg, who lives on the Upper East
 Side, faced criticism that outer boroughs had gotten short shift from 
plows. Brooklyn-dwelling de Blasio, then the city's public advocate, was
 among the critics.

This
 time, de Blasio found himself being asked why some Upper East Side 
avenues still were covered in snow when a Brooklyn thoroughfare was 
plowed clear to the pavement.

Pamela
 Murphy Jennings' two children navigated snowy sections of tony Madison 
and Park avenues to get to their public schools on the Upper East Side, 
she said in an interview.

‘Children
 have to walk to city bus stops and cross these streets to get here,’ 
she said. ‘Cars are sliding on roads. If there was any day to close 
schools, this was the day.’

De
 Blasio said officials made the right call in anticipating that streets 
would be passable enough for students to get to school safely, adding 
that his own teenage son had gone, if grouchily.

Whoa! This poor gentleman tumbled to the ground while crossing the street at 40th and 5th Avenue in Manhattan as the remnants of Tuesdays snowstorm stayed on the ground

But
 the Department of Education said that Wednesday's attendance rate was 
only 47.1 percent - far below the average daily attendance rate of about
 90 percent for the 1.1 million students who make up the nation's 
largest public school system.

Traffic and the storm's timetable complicated the clean-up, he and Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty said.

The
 storm arrived earlier than expected on Tuesday and intensified right 
around the evening rush, making it difficult to plow and spread salt, 
Doherty said.

Citywide, 
100 percent of primary streets were plowed by 6 a.m. on Wednesday, along
 with 90 percent or more of other streets, Doherty said.

On
 Wednesday morning Today show weatherman Al Roker had tore into de 
Blasio's overnight response to the snowstorm which caused traffic chaos 
across the Big Apple  - after the New York Mayor claimed the city was 
caught by surprise.

Venting
 his frustration with the new administration, Roker, who is widely 
respected as the nation's most trusted weather presenter, used this 
morning's show to pour scorn on de Blasio's claim that the storm arrived
 three hours earlier than expected.

'They claimed it caught them off guard, that it came in early,' a clearly irate Roker exclaimed.

'No, no, no, it didn't! They should have been watching us!'

Roker's
 fury was followed by scores of people dangerously tumbling to the 
ground on snow and ice covered streets more than 24-hours after the 
snowstorm hit New York City.

Roker
 said that he feared that de Blasio, who has only been in office less 
than a month, had made a huge mistake by not being on top of his 
response to the storm.

He
 then made an ominous reference to former New York Mayor John Lindsay, 
who never shook off his reaction to the February 1969 nor'easter which 
left 14 people dead and 68 injured.

'Two Words Mr. Mayor....John Lindsay!'

Lindsay
 was seen to only care about how the snow plows dealt with Manhattan and
 when he visited Queens a week after the storm - was told, 'Get away, 
you bum', by a resident disgusted he had the gall to visit when there 
was still snow on the ground.

The team at NBC's Morning Joe were equally as incredulous as Al Roker. 'I have lived in this city for 35-years,' said host Joe Scarborough. 'And I have never seen such chaos.'
