A Coca-Cola shareholder has slammed the beverage giant for paying its executives an excessive $24billion in stock rewards.

New York money manager David Winter, founder of Wintergreen Advisers, claims there's 'no reasonable basis' for the lavish proposed payouts and is urging fellow shareholders - including Warren Buffett - to vote down the decision at Coke's upcoming annual meeting.

In letter issued to shareholders, multimillionaire Winter wrote: 'We can find no reasonable basis for gifting management 14.2 percent of the share capital of Coca-Cola, worth $24 billion at today's share price.'

He called the 'gifting' unnecessary and 
said in the letter, obtained by ABC News, 'It is unfathomable that they 
would require such astronomical sums of money to provide motivation.'

Winter goes on to claim the compensation proposal shirks shareholders and puts the 'economic well-being of management far ahead.'

Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, holds around 9 percent of Coke's stock and Winter sent him a personal version of the note requesting him to similarly oppose the plan. Winter himself has 2,479,843 shares in the company.

According to ABC, Buffett has not yet replied.

In a statement Coke argues that the $24billion pat on the back is not a given, but that management will be required to meet specific goals and financial targets to be eligible.

And those targets include delivering for shareholders.

Coke also says the proposed rewards will not just be handed out to senior executives but to a larger group of employees as a talent retention policy.

Coke's board, which includes Howard Buffett, Warren's son, backs the compensation plan.

But Winters reiterated to ABC News that 14.2 percent is over-the-top.

'We believe that's too much. It's a tough headwind (for the stock) to overcome,' he told the network.

He adds that only 6,400 staff will be eligible to benefit out of 151,000 employees, which each standing to get about $2 million each, on average.
