On a night when the Home Nations exceeded expectations, Northern Ireland’s 2-0 win in Greece stood out as the most impressive result of the lot. It sees them top Group F with nine points from nine having emerged successful from trips to two of the toughest destinations, including Hungary.

A visit to Romania, two points behind in second, comes next month, but given their performances so far that should not mean any trepidation.

It is little more than a year since Luxembourg embarrassed Michael O’Neill’s side to burst the bubble created by victory over Russia and a draw with Portugal.

But the air is back among this camp made up of the game’s lesser lights. Jonny Evans, it should be noted, has not featured because of injury.

Here Sportsmail details the country causing the biggest surprise in qualifying for Euro 2016 and the man behind it all.

Roy Carroll – A familiar name between the sticks, the 37-year-old is enjoying a renaissance for club and country. The former Manchester United goalkeeper left Olympiacos in the summer to join Notts County in League One and had kept five clean sheets as they sit a point outside the play-offs.

Conor McLaughlin – Everyone at Fleetwood Town knows who he is; a key reason the club gained promotion from League Two last season. Full back, 23, made his national debut in October 2011 but was only winning his sixth cap against Greece. Started out at Preston.

Gareth McAuley – One of the dressing room leaders at West Bromwich Albion, but has lost his place to Craig Dawson this term. A late bloomer, he was at Lincoln City until 2006, before eventually getting his Premier League chance at The Hawthorns three years ago.

Aaron Hughes – Veteran of Newcastle, Aston Villa, Fulham, Queens Park Rangers, and now Brighton, the 34-year-old centre back is a dependable figure in the Northern Irish team. He has 93 caps and is one half of a defensive duo aged 68. Experience, is the word.

Shane Ferguson – The left back has been at Newcastle since signing from Derry City in 2007 and has a smattering of Premier League appearances. On loan at Birmingham last season, he has yet to play a club game this campaign, leaving him fresh for national exploits.

Chris Baird – Now operating in a holding midfield role having played across the backline during a career spent largely at Southampton and Fulham. He signed for West Brom in the summer on a free having only made 16 appearances for Reading and Burnley last season. Yet to break into Alan Irvine’s side.

Corry Evans – Younger brother to Jonny, the midfielder added grit in Greece. He was at Manchester United for six years but moved to Hull in 2011, before joining Blackburn last summer. During his time at Old Trafford, was nominated for reserve player of the year by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer alongside Tom Cleverley but was beaten by James Chester.

Steven Davis – A buzzing, attacking midfielder perhaps in the form of his career having been given a freer reign at Southampton with the departure of Adam Lallana. Born in Ballymena, he joined Aston Villa aged 17 but is best remembered in Glasgow playing for Rangers.

Oliver Norwood – Another from the Manchester United school of education, the player born in Burnley originally turned out for England at Under 16 and 17 levels. He switched to the Northern Ireland youth set-up in 2010, qualifying through family heritage, and now has 20 caps. Norwood plays for Championship club Reading.

Jamie Ward – Another born this side of the Irish Sea, the 28-year-old travelled far before finding his feet at Derby, where he is an important player offering dynamism on the wings. Beginning at hometown club Aston Villa, he spent time at Stockport, Torquay, Chesterfield, and Sheffield United. Qualifying through his grandfather, he has always played for Northern Ireland internationally.

Kyle Lafferty – The totemic striker is on a mean scoring streak for his country. He strong finish after a slick breakaway against Greece brought him a third goal in three qualifying games. He has yet to find the net for Norwich however, having signed from Palermo in the summer. When Rangers were demoted to the bottom rung of Scottish football he went to FC Sion in Switzerland, then to Italy.

Manager - Michael O’Neill – Not to be confused with another M O’Neill who brought Northern Ireland cheer but is now doing his stuff south of the border, this 45-year-old is a relative coaching unknown. His playing career saw him at clubs such as Newcastle, Coventry, Reading and Wigan – as well as Portland Timbers across the Atlantic – but managing at Brechin City and Shamrock Rovers, where he won back-to-back titles, preceded his chance at the national job.
