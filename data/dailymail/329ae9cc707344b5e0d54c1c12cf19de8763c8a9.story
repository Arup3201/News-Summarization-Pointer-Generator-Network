A Tennessee judge reversed a ruling today for an eight-month-old boy's name to be changed from Messiah to Martin.

Child Support Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew had ordered the boy's name to be changed to Martin because of the religious connection to Messiah, but his mother Jaleesa Martin appealed the decision.

Messiah's parents had gone to court originally because they couldn't agree on their son's last name, but instead the judge took a dislike to the first name and kept both mother and father's last names.

'The word 'Messiah' is a title, and 
it's a title that has only been earned by one person - and that one 
person is Jesus Christ', Ballew said.

But
today Chancellor Telford E. Forgety Jr. ruled that the court had acted 
unconstitutionally and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. 
Constitution,Â USA Today reported.

Jeleesa
Martin appealed the ruling under grounds it was unconstitutional and 
that she and the father had arrived at court to discuss their son's last
name.

She said: 'I was 
shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means God 
and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name because 
of her religious beliefs'.

The boy is now officially called Messiah DeShawn McCollough.

It
was revealed last week that magistrate Lu Ann Ballew first ruled to 
keep the original name but then changed the written record and held a 
second hearing.

According
to a brief, in the magistrate's written findings 'the section 
regarding the child's name was originally filled out but then appears to
have been whited out, with the magistrate then writing that the child's
name is 'reserved until further hearing'.'

The youngster, Messiah, has no idea about the struggle to keep his name

Ballew
called a second hearing on Aug. 8, where she changed the baby's name to
Martin McCullough, although neither parent had requested the change.

In the new written findings, Ballew explained the change by saying that the name Messiah was not in the child's best interest.

'Messiah'
means Savior, Deliverer, the One who will restore God's Kingdom. 
'Messiah' is a title that is held only by Jesus Christ,' she wrote.

Ballew further stated that 'it is highly likely that he will offend many Cocke County citizens by calling himself 'Messiah'.'

The 
mother's two other children are called Micah and Mason and she argued 
that she wanted to name her third child with an M too.

Messiah is ranked 387th most popular baby name according to the Social Security Administration's 2012 list of names.

A WBIR reporter asked the judge in August what she thought about all the children named Jesus.

'Well, I thought about that,' she responded. 'That's not relevant to this case.'

Martin was amazed a judge could force her to change her son's name because of their own religion.

'I
was shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means
God and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name 
because of her religious beliefs.'

The U.S. does not currently legislate baby name choices, therefore Jaleesa Martin has not changed her baby's name yet.
