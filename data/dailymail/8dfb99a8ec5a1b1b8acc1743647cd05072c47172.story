A shocking video captures the moment a bus plunged off a cliff on the 'world's most dangerous road'.

The jaw-dropping footage shows the driver creeping past the cliff's edge on a treacherous stretch of the Bolivian pass while a crowd tries to help guide his way.

One man who steps forward and gestures to the driver to help him steer further away from the edge does so in vain as it eventually tips forward with the weight of it carrying it over the side.

Heavy rain had made the Camino de la Muerte — or Road of Death — muddy and slippery making it especially dangerous to drive on.

The crowd looked on in horror as the bus fell 50 metres down the ravine killing the driver.

The 38-mile pass from La Paz to Coroico, Bolivia's Amazon region, claims an estimated 200 to 300 lives a year, The Sun reported.

In 1995 the Inter-American Development Bank reportedly christened it the 'world's most dangerous road.'

According to reports, the driver had been alone in the bus as he had unloaded his 50 passengers before attempting to negotiate the dangerous track.
