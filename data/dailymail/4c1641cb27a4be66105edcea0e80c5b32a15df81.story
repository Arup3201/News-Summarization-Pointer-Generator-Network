Occupy Wall Street has its first corporate backing after Ben & Jerry’s today announced it is getting behind the protesters.

The Vermont-based ice-cream company, known for standing up for liberal issues, slammed the ‘immoral’ inequality between classes in the U.S.

It followed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi backing the movement as the political debate around the protests intensified.

Ice-cream: Ben & Jerry’s said it has the ‘deepest admiration’ for protesters because of the U.S. unemployment crisis and rising cost of higher education

Ben & Jerry’s said it has the ‘deepest admiration’ for protesters because of the U.S. unemployment crisis and rising cost of higher education.

‘We know that words are relatively easy but we wanted to act quickly to demonstrate our support,’ a statement on its website said.

‘We realise that Occupy Wall Street is calling for systemic change.

‘We support this call to action and are honoured to join you in this call to take back our nation and democracy.’

Ben & Jerry's, which is part of the Unilever conglomerate, is well-known as an outspoken anti-capitalist company.

‘We seek and support nonviolent ways to achieve peace and justice,’ its mission statement on the Unilever website reads.

‘We believe government resources are more productively used in meeting human needs than in building and maintaining weapons systems.’

It was founded in 1978 and two years ago launched a 'Hubby Hubby' ice-cream in support of same-sex marriage.

The company also launched a 'Yes Pecan' flavour to celebrate Barack Obama's becoming U.S. president.

Ben & Jerry’s often holds free ice-cream giveaways - so Occupy Wall Street protesters will be hoping that will be the case again here.

It comes as concerns were raised that the protesters' New York camp in Zuccotti Park is being infiltrated by opportunists looking for sex and drugs.

The National Air and Space Museum was closed in Washington D.C. on Saturday after anti-war protesters stormed it and were repelled by guards.

They were the unlikely pair who used a $5 course in ice-cream making to become one of America's most iconic success stories in recent decades.

Ben Greenfield and Jerry 
Cohen set up a business with $12,000 in 1978, and it turned into one of the 
most well-known ice-cream firms worldwide.

The Vermont company tries to promote 'linked prosperity', so it is big on ethical business practices, sustainable growth and being socially responsible.

It became a multimillion-dollar publicly traded company before being bought by conglomerate Unilever for a whopping $326million in 2000.

Mr Cohen and Mr Greenfield kept away from the running of the company, but they often help out at openings of new stores.

The duo were disillusioned that Unilever had not vigorously pursued the mission of corporate social responsibility it accepted with the purchase.

But they have maintained their political affiliation despite the sell-out, and Unilever has brought out its own liberal flavours over the last two years.

The 'Hubby Hubby' ice-cream was launched in 2009 to support same-sex marriage and 'Yes Pecan' marked Barack Obama's presidential election.

But it caused a stir with its latest creation, 'Schweddy Balls', which was boycotted by a leading mothers' organisation who branded it 'vulgar'.
