A former deputy headmaster who admitted using hidden cameras to spy on pupils when they went to the toilet has had his jail term cut following an appeal.

Gareth Williams, who worked at Ysgol Gymraeg Gyfun Glantaf in Cardiff, pleaded guilty to 31 charges of voyeurism and making more than 16,000 indecent images of children earlier this year.

The married father-of-four, 48, was sentenced to five years in prison at Cardiff Crown Court in May, but has today had that reduced to four years.

Williams, 48, set up pinhole cameras in clocks, fans and toilet cisterns to film semi-naked children, and even put a camera in the toilet of changing rooms on sports day to catch as many as possible.

He also installed cameras in two private homes. A total of 31 children at the 1,300-strong school aged between 11 and 16 were captured on camera.

At his sentencing in May, prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'This was a serious systematic abuse of trust - a devious and determined invasion of privacy of the children.

'The effect on children, staff and parents was one of complete and utter disbelief.'  

Today, three judges at the Court of Appeal in London upheld a sentence challenge by Williams, saying his jail term was 'manifestly excessive' and cutting it to four years.

Mr Justice Green said Williams, of Rhiwbina, Cardiff, installed the recording devices to get photos of boys for his 'obsessive' gratification. 

Williams had been deputy headteacher of  the largest Welsh language medium school in the country.

He was investigated by police after computer specialists found he had been purchasing paedophilic images on the internet.

His home was raided, and officers discovered two laptops, 11 memory sticks and pinhole camera gear. Williams had also installed software on his computers allowing him to browse the internet undetected.

About 99 per cent of the images were at the least serious level, with the rest containing more grave content.

Those taken at the school featured naked and semi-naked boys.

His catalogue of indecent photos included many downloaded from the web, the court heard.

After his arrest, Williams said he had been examining images of boy for 10 years in a bid to 'understand their physical development' and he was less interested in girls.

But he also admitted a long-standing interest in boys and accepted it had become a fixation. 

In May Judge Rhys Rowlands branded Williams 'depraved', telling him his crimes were a 'dreadful and protracted breach of trust'.

On appeal today, his defence barrister Davis Elias argued that the sentence was 'simply too long', especially given his mitigation.

The barrister said the extensive cataloguing of the voyeurism images by age supported Williams' claim that he was, at least in part, interested in children's physical development.

'Why he behaved in this way will always remain a mystery,' Mr Elias added.

Mr Justice Green, sitting with Sir Brian Leveson and Mr Justice Goss, said: 'We conclude that the overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

'We also conclude that insufficient weight was attached to the mitigating features, in particular the devastating impact which the appellant's conduct has had upon his personal life.

'In these circumstances, we quash the sentence of five years' imprisonment and substitute one of four years' imprisonment.

'To this extent, this appeal is allowed.' 

There was an outcry after Williams continued receiving a salary of around £65,000-a-year after being arrested and remanded in custody in January.

He was dismissed by the school following his sentencing in May. It was estimated that he was paid around £16,000 after he made his first guilty pleas. 

An NSPCC spokesperson said: 'It’s for the courts to determine what sentence an offender gets but we would always want it to be a deterrent - otherwise the wrong message is sent to both the victims and the convicted. 

'On his release, it is important that Mr Williams is closely monitored and banned from working with children again.'
