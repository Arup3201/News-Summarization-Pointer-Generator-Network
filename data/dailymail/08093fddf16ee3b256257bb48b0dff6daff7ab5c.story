Binmen have been blasted by a great grandmother after they refused to move her one-wheeled bin for health and safety reasons - even though she managed it.

Widow Anne Hobson, 71, who suffers from asthma and osteo-arthritis dragged the broken bin 50 feet down her driveway for it to be collected.

But because its right wheel had broken off, refuse collectors declined to wheel it just a few feet to their truck.

Anne Hobson's binmen refused to empty her wheelie bin for health and safety reasons after one of its wheels fell off

Retired bookkeeper Mrs Hobson, from Farnworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester said: 'It's unbelievable that I can drag the bin 50ft to the end of my driveway, but able-bodied men can't take it from the kerbside and have it emptied into the wagon just a few feet away.

'I think they're just lazy and being jobsworths. It seems to me they want the job done for them and they can't be bothered.'

The incident occurred on Friday after Mrs Hobson took her full bin out for collection as usual only for its wheel to fall off as she dragged it down her driveway.

She added: 'I was just putting the bin out like I normally do for the bin men and the wheel came off. I've had that same bin for thirty years, the wheel just fell off due to wear and tear.

'It was still there when everyone else's had been collected. They never even came to tell me why they couldn't collect it and there was no note left on the bin.

'I couldn't believe it, I have never heard anything so ridiculous in my life. Thirty years ago they used to carry the bins on their backs and they didn't even have wheels then, there's none of that now, all they need to do now is drag it a couple of feet. If it's due to health and safety, they've all gone mad.

'I managed to drag that heavy bin all that way a despite being old and only 5ft1 these young 6ft strong men couldn't pull it a couple of feet. It's crazy.

'I have been doing this every week and I've never heard of such nonsense.

Anne Hobson will be left without a rubbish collection until a new bin arrives to replace her broken wheelie bin

'When we called the council they didn't want to know, it's just an excuse and there was no reasoning with the council when we got on to them.'

'They told me they couldn't pick it up for a week and when I said it would be overflowing with rubbish they told me to leave it in bags next to the bin.

'The thing is if anyone was to leave bags they would just not collect them and we would be in the same situation.

'I have two cats and don't want that rubbish leaving on the floor. It's only Monday but I dread to think what it's going to be like on Friday, because it will have accumulated. It's ludicrous.

'To say that no one can come out of all those men who work for Bolton Council is simply appalling. They are just being lazy, obviously it is too much trouble for these able bodied and burly men.

'I can't say they have been very helpful about the situation, anyone would have thought that I'd pulled the wheel off myself. I've had that bin for thirty years, the council are just trying to cop out and are using any excuse not to do their jobs.'

Mrs Hobson's son Andrew said: 'It's absolutely ridiculous that a 71-year-old woman can drag a bin with one wheel to the end of her long driveway when 6ft tall, 15-stone binmen can't empty it.

'And I'm also upset that she won't get another bin earlier. It seems to be all about what suits them.'

Bolton Council have offered to a supply a new grey bin free of charge. A spokesman said: 'The bin was not emptied due to the missing wheel.

'It will be replaced free of charge next Friday, the delivery day for this area, and any excess waste will also be removed next Friday.'
