Manchester City are weighing up a move for Feyenoord defender Terence Kongolo.

City had scouts watching 20-year-old Kongolo and his defensive partner Sven van Beek at the recent Europa League game with HNK Rijeka.

City want a left-sided centre-back who can provide competition to the first team and who they can also develop.

Kongolo's younger brother, 16-year-old midfielder Rodney, is already at City having joined last summer despite interest from Liverpool and Manchester United.

Terence, who can also play left-back, has two caps for Holland after being handed his debut by Louis van Gaal.

He was part of the squad that finished third at last summer's World Cup but played just one minute, coming off the bench in the closing stages against Chile. 

Borussia Dortmund are also interested in the Feyenoord pair and had a delegation including technical director Michael Zorc in the stands for the Rijeka game which Feyenoord won 2-0.

Kongolo has played 14 times this season and has started every game in a run that has seen the Dutch side keep five consecutive clean sheets.
