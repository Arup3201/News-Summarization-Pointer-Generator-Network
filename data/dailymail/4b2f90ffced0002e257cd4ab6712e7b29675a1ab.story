Woe: Investors continued to shed Facebook shares on Tuesday. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is pictured

Investors continued to shed Facebook shares on Tuesday, as brokers' growing doubts over the stock's valuation bubbled to the surface.

Facebook's shares hit a low of $30.98 on Tuesday, 8.9 per cent below Monday's close, a loss of 18 per cent from their $38 IPO price.

Many analysts predict its value will continue to fall in the wake of the much-hyped but shambolic initial public offering of 421m shares.

More than 28 million shares had traded in early action on Tuesday, making it one of the most actively traded in U.S. markets.

Shares were recently at $31.75, down 6.7 per cent on the day.

At the low, the stock had lost 30 per cent from a high of $45 hit shortly after trading started on Friday.

'At the moment it's not living up to the hype,' said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.

Facebook's flotation on the Nasdaq was one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history, raising nearly $20billion for the web giant.

The drop in Facebook's share price wiped more than $11billion off of the company's market capitalization, or the total value of the tradable shares of a publicly traded company.

Some financial advisers, who might have been furious last week at getting left out, were counting themselves lucky by Monday that they did not get their clients involved.

'By pure luck I failed to talk it up with a lot of clients because I didn't think I would be able to get much,' said one Raymond James adviser, who sought, and received, only 500 shares for one client.

'I basically told people they weren't going to get any, and luckily, it proved to be a bust,' the adviser said.

Facebook's revenue growth has also been slowing recently, raising flags among some who believe the company should show consistently strong revenue growth at this stage in its life.

Just days before the initial public offering the company surprised investors when it disclosed that its revenue may plummet even more by users transitioning to mobile platforms, where advertising is less proven.

That prompted the analyst at Morgan Stanley to surprisingly tell clients that he was cutting his revenue forecasts for the company.

Thomson Reuters Starmine, meanwhile, using expected growth rates of about 10.8 percent over the next decade, values the shares at just $9.59, or less than one-third of its current price.

Dave Rovelli, a senior trader at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC he would be reluctant to invest in Facebook until it had a viable long-term plan for turning its unprecedented amount of user data into profit.

'There's no bottom,' he said, noting that most major financial institutions were short-selling the shares. 'So there's no reason to jump in here. You're catching a falling knife.'

He added that the sharp fall in Facebook's share price 'leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth', and could damage the reputation of stock markets as a whole.

'We're trying to get the retail investor back on board, and everyone who bought it is getting creamed,' Mr Rovelli said.

Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group who was the first expert to advise selling Facebook shares on Friday, said he thought the company's true value was around $30 a share.

'There must have been some sober second thoughts about this,' he said in the wake of Monday's mass sell-off.

Mr Wieser added that there were 'real concerns about growth and advertisers' frequent lack of certainty how best to use Facebook'.
