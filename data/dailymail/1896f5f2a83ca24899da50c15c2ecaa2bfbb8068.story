When 19-year-old Jarrod Lawrence made the harrowing decision to turn off his mother's life support last month he knew an almighty struggle had begun.

The latest in a string of tragedies, it marked the moment Jarrod was left to care for his two teenage brothers by himself.

With medical bills of their own, a massive mortgage on the family's western Sydney home and at least 10 more years of education costs, the Lawrence boys (Jarrod, Blake, 16, and Dylan, 14) faced life as orphans.

Struggle: Jarrod Lawrence, with girlfriend Nelly, has been left to care for his younger brothers Blake, 16, and Dylan, 14, after the death of their mother earlier this year

And without the roof over their head, the boys would have to split up and move into separate foster families.

Their father Christopher died on February 2, 2008 'in unfortunate circumstances'. Mum Natalie died on March 17 this year after suffering two brain aneurisms.

She was buried four days later, on Jarrod's birthday.

'It's a tragedy, I still choke up thinking about it,' John Frew, principal of the boys' high school in Holsworthy, told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's heartbreaking for everybody, the eldest boy has become the head of the family and he had to make the decision to take his mother off life support.

'I went to the dad's funeral too, it's been devastating. But in all the sadness, I feel a lot of pride.'

And well he might. The boys' gut-wrenching story caught the attention of Channel 9 prime time television program A Current Affair and something very special happened.

Their uncertain future was profiled on March 31 to an Australian audience in the millions and producers encouraged viewers to donate money to a bank account set up in Jarrod's name.

A Current Affair reporter Brady Halls said he expected humble donations to trickle in from the public and more sizeabale ones from big businesses. 

But what has happened over the last 48 hours has shocked everybody.

Thousands of donations have poured into the brothers' bank account from Australians rich and poor.

Brady Halls choked back tears as he told viewers of an $8,000 donation from an elderly woman caring for her husband suffering from dementia.

This morning an emotional Jarrod Lawrence told Daily Mail Australia he and his brothers had so far received an astonishing $750,000. And the figure is still climbing.

'It's great, it's just amazing, unbelievable' he said. 

'It's been tough, but we'll get through.'

Jarrod is no stranger to turmoil. In addition to losing both parents in the space of six years, his youngest brother Dylan underwent brain surgery in 2012 to have tumours removed.

He is now on the mend.

'They're going OK,' Jarrod said.

'We're sticking together. The school's been great, everyone's been great.'

The huge monetary gift means the three brothers will now be able to stay together in Holsworthy.

Uniform costs and school fees have been waived by Holsworthy High School and principal John Frew said Jarrod, who has ambitions of being a primary school teacher, has picked the right career path.

'He's got a certain inner-strength and I'm encouraging him to be a teacher, he would be fantastic,' Mr Frew said.

'I always thought he'd be a PE teacher but I think he'd be great in primary school, he's a great role model.'

In addition to the thousands of heartwarming donations from the public, mostly anonymous, businesses around Australia have also thrown cash into the Lawrence boys' coffers.

Channel 9 donated $20,000; colourful businessman Dick Smith pledged the same amount; Kurri Kurri mining company Alfabs Mining gave $10,000. A nine-year-old boy, named Quentin, chucked in $121 with the help of his brothers Cody and Romeo.

The boys' Queensland grandmother, pensioner Jan Lingard, sobbed almost uncontrollably when it was revealed on live television on Tuesday night that the appeal had raised $550,000.

'Thank you, thank you Australia, thanks everybody, they deserve it,' she said.

'(Daughter Natalie) was an angel and now she's a real angel. She would be so proud of these boys.'

The brothers are all keen sports fans and are being helped through their heartache by teammates.

Jarrod told Daily Mail Australia that once the mortgage and bills were taken care of, all financial decisions would be shared by the inspiring young trio.

'I'm going to put some money away for brothers' future wants and then ask them what they want to do,' he said.

Donations can be made to the Lawrence boys by depositing money into the following bank account: Jarrod James Lawrence, Commonwealth Bank, BSB: 062 322, Account Number: 1042 0700
