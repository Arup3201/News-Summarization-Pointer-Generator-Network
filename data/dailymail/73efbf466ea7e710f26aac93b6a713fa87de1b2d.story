A Premier League footballer is facing a driving ban after he was caught speeding and using his mobile while driving his Bentley.

Bolton Wanderers midfielder Chris Eagles, was clocked travelling at 60mph in a 40mph zone on Princess Parkway in Manchester by a police officer with a hand-held video camera.

The former Manchester United starlet has already racked up seven points on his licence, and last year he was caught driving without insurance.

Eagles pleaded guilty via his solicitor Rachael Walsh to both offences at Manchester magistratesâ€™ court.

Speaking in court, prosecutor Ben Collinson said: 'There are two 
offences. A speeding on the northbound section of Princess Parkway on 
June 9 where the defendant was travelling at 60mph in a 40mph area at 
1.20pm. He was also seen to be using his mobile phone.'

The offences could see Eagles handed an additional five points that would result in a six-month ban.

Miss Walsh said her client had temporarily borrowed the car from his sick sister.

She added: 'He has a sister who suffers 
from a life-threatening illness and the call was from her so he took it 
fearing for her well-being. The car had a Bluetooth (hands-free) system 
but this was not working.'

Miss Walsh urged magistrates to impose 
four points upon Eagles licence, saying he travelled 20,000 miles every 
year, carried out charity work and spent time caring for his younger 
siblings and nephew who live near London.

Eagles will now have to decide whether to launch an exceptional hardship argument in an attempt to have that penalty lowered.

The case has been adjourned for sentencing to April 11.
