A husband and wife who worked as NHS managers were paid nearly £1million in redundancy money – only to be rehired by the health service within weeks.

Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March.

Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished.

By June both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director.

Golden goodbye: Karen Straughair pocketed £605,000 and Chris Reed was given £345,000 redundancy

Shadow health minister Andy Burnham called it a ‘scandalous abuse of precious resources’, while Dan Poulter the Tory health minister blamed lax redundancy rules under Labour that allowed mega payoffs for public employees.

The pair are among dozens of senior staff who received ‘golden goodbyes’ of more than £100,000; many of which later found new jobs in the ‘revolving door’ of the NHS.

The bosses lost their jobs when the NHS organisations employing them were abolished.They were among 161 NHS bodies responsible for buying services – among them Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities – that were abolished to be replaced by GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups under reforms in April.

Analysis of Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities’ final accounts, published yesterday, suggests payouts in excess of £100,000 were made to more than 50 staff and more than a dozen of these well-paid chiefs have since found work in the public sector.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham called the situation a ¿scandalous abuse of precious resources¿

Critics have said payouts should be capped and recouped when staff are reemployed soon after being let go.

On an online forum for an NHS trade publication, one critic posted: ‘Surely a relevant question is how come two former Chief Executives, effectively Mr and Mrs NHS Tyne and Wear can pocket hundreds of thousands in redundancy payments and then get relatively swiftly re-employed by the NHS on mega high salaries.’

Another wrote: ‘Just a minor point of Governance … does the Interim Chief Exec hold his wife to account if she fails to deliver her objectives? Isn’t that a bit too cosy when the organisation in question is facing such a huge challenge?’

The National Audit Office estimated in the summer that 10,000 people had lost their jobs at a total cost of £430million. At the time, the NAO said that 44 very senior managers were made redundant at an average cost of £277,273.

Labour accused the Government of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds by replacing the statutory bodies with 211 new Clinical Commissioning Groups.

But the Government blamed lax contracts drawn up under Labour, saying their ‘hands were tied’. Mr Burnham said last night: ‘This  is precisely what we warned  would happen.’

He told The Times: ‘David  Cameron’s refusal to listen and honour his promise of no top-down re-organisation has resulted in  a scandalous abuse of precious NHS resources.

‘He has given gold-plated, six-figure payoffs to thousands of managers while handing P45s to 6,000 nurses.’

Conservative Mr Poulter said: ‘Dismantling Labour’s bloated bureaucracy left us with a big bill, but that’s because manager  numbers and wages rose so quickly on Labour's watch, and their ridiculously lax redundancy rules tied our hands.’

He added: ‘We have overhauled their system to make sure this can never happen again.’

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be appalled that some of these golden goodbyes ran to six figures – especially for those individuals who have walked straight through the revolving door into another highly paid public sector job.’

The salary arrangements and terms of employment of Mrs Straughair and Mr Reed in the Leeds posts are not known, and both have recently left the trust.

Sir David Nicholson wrote to the leaders of abolished bodies in March urging them not to take large payoffs and quickly seek new jobs in the NHS, which they are entitled to do after four weeks.

There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the individuals receiving payoffs but campaigners have criticised the size of the sums dished out when care services are under pressure.
