Chancellor Angela Merkel called 
President Barack Obama today after receiving information that U.S. 
intelligence may have targeted her mobile phone, the German government 
said

The White House has denied that the U.S. is listening in on Merkel's phone calls.

The German government said it responded after receiving 'information that the chancellor's cellphone may be monitored' by U.S. intelligence.

It wouldn't elaborate but German news
magazine Der Spiegel, which has published material from NSA leaker 
Edward Snowden, said its research triggered the response.

Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said
in a statement the chancellor made clear to Obama in a phone call that 
'she views such practices, if the indications are confirmed ... as 
completely unacceptable.'

Merkel said among close partners such
as Germany and the U.S., 'there must not be such surveillance of a head
of government's communication,' Seibert added.

'That would be a serious breach of trust. Such practices must be stopped immediately.

In Washington, White House spokesman 
Jay Carney said 'the United States is not monitoring and will not 
monitor the communications of the chancellor.'

A statement from the White House added: 'The United States greatly values our close cooperation with Germany on a broad range of shared security challenges.

'As the President has said, the United States is reviewing the way that we gather intelligence to ensure that we properly balance the security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share.'

Der Spiegel noted that the White House spokesperson 'did not wish to specify' whether the U.S. denied monitoring Merkel's communications in the past.

Merkel raised concerns over 
electronic eavesdropping issue when Obama visited Germany in June, has 
demanded answers from the U.S. government and backed calls for greater 
European data protection.

However, Wednesday's statement was 
much more sharply worded and appeared to reflect frustration over the 
answers provided so far by the U.S. government.

Merkel called for U.S. authorities to
clarify the extent of surveillance in Germany and to provide answers to
'questions that the German government asked months ago,' Seibert said.
