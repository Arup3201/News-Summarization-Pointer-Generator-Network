The oldest living crew member of the USS Arizona, the battleship which sunk in just nine minutes during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, resulting in the loss of 1,177 lives, has died aged 100.

Retired Navy Lieutenant Commander Joseph Langdell was the ship's last surviving officers, before his death at a nursing home in Yuba City, Northern California, on February 4.

Langdell was one of the few who was not killed when the Japanese attacked the Arizona on December 7, 1941, because, by a stroke of luck, he happened to be on shore at the time. 

Had he been onboard, the then 28-year-old would have  died, he later said.

Navy Lt. Commander Joseph Langdell - seen here wearing his dress white uniform - has died aged 100. He was the oldest living crew member of the battleship USS Arizona to have survived Pearl Harbor

Langdell, who was 28 at the time, watched the USS Arizona sink in just nine minutes - taking 1,177 of his crew mates with it

Langdell was an ensign on an assignment which meant he was sleeping on a military base next to the ship in Honolulu, Hawaii, that morning.

The young officer, who graduated from Boston University in 1938 before joining the Navy aged 26, was awoken by 'a strange noise' - the sounds of the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbour.

He rushed outside, and watched his ship sink in just nine minutes.

He would later tell the Appeal Democrat he was 'as close as you could get' to the bombing without being hit. 

'I felt absolutely helpless as I watched the attack,' Langdell recalled on the 56th anniversary of the attack that drew the United States into World War II.

'If I had been aboard, I would have been killed in that No. 2 (gun) turret. That was the one that blew up. 

'It was my luck to be assigned off the ship that day.'

Only 335 people survived on the USS Arizona, and Langdell spent the following hours and days trying to rescue shipmates from the burning water, preparing for another possible air assault. 

In total, eight battleships were lost or damaged in the attack - including the Arizona - while 2,335 men died. The bombing led to the U.S.'s entry into World War Two.

'I saw some of my men wading ashore,' he said in 2009. 'We took them down to the naval hospital, and went back and got some more.

Ten days later, he was tasked with leading the survivors to remove the dead bodies 'above the waterline'.

It took them two days.  

It took Langdell and other survivors two days to clear the bodies from the Arizona. Pictured: The American destroyer USS Shaw explodes during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour

The New Hampshire native spent another four years in the Navy - marrying his wife Libby in 1942 - before going to work as an auctioneer, a furniture manufacturer's representative and eventually the long-time owner of a Yuba City furniture store.

The couple had three children - two boys and a girl. However, he kept quiet about his war experiences until they were older. 

Younger son Ted said his father  returned to Pearl Harbor for the first time since the war in 1976, when his older son was in the Navy.

After that, Langdell took comfort in meeting with fellow survivors and pride in always wearing a USS Arizona hat - becoming a regular at the parades in his hometown.

'It drew attention not just to him, but gave him the chance to tell stories,' Ted said.

'Anyone in the service has stories to tell if you make the effort to listen and to really hear and try to understand what they are saying.'

In 2001 - 50 years after the attack on the Arizona - Langdell would come face-to-face with one of the men who carried out the bombing.

As part of a film remembering the Arizona, Langell accepted a floral wreath in memory of his crew mates from former Japanese Lt Commander Zenji Abe at a memorial to the ship.

Abe - who is described in USS Arizona: The Life and Death of a Lady as having dropped one of the first bombs - says he prays the men are at peace.

'I appreciate your thoughtfulness,' Langdell responds. 'It took more courage on your part to present this wreath than it did for me to accept it.'

Langdell's ashes will be put aboard the USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii, mostly likely on December 7.

The reunion association says there are now eight remaining survivors.

Langdell - seen here standing in the Shrine Room of the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor in 2008 - did not talk about his experiences in the attack until his children had grown up

He would later become an active member of the USS Arizona's survivors association, and was a regular at parades in his hometown. Pictured: Battleship USS West Virginia in, flames after hits from Japanese bombs and torpedoes
