What a finish, what a game, what a quarterback. And why didn't they run it? 

The New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24, but that does not come close to telling the story. This was a game which had it all.

A last-minute interception by a rookie free agent, an insane catch which made David Tyree's look pedestrian, a previously unknown receiver going for over a hundred yards after collecting his first four passes in the NFL and another chapter in the storied dynasty of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.

In winning the Super Bowl MVP title for the third time in his career, Brady showed all of his trademark precision and poise to lead the Patriots to their fourth Super Bowl title, somehow coming back from a ten-point deficit to defeat the defending champion Seattle Seahawks.

In doing so, Brady shattered records galore. He joins the likes of Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw on four rings, and is now the all-time leader with 12 Super Bowl touchdown passes and completions on 37.

In his record sixth appearance in the NFL’s seasonal showpiece, the 37-year-old showed all the resilience and leadership gleaned from his storied career, using short passes to slice through Seattle’s No 1 ranked defense.

Protected by his offensive line, time and again he picked apart Pete Carroll’s side, showing mental acumen, poise and above all leadership to go 4-2 in Super Bowls.

In a dramatic, seesaw game the game-changing moment came in the fourth quarter with Rob Ninkovich’s sack on Russell Wilson. The momentum suddenly shifted, Brady marched 76 yards and connected with the inspired Julian Edelman for what turned out to be the winning touchdown with just over two minutes remaining.

But Seattle were not beaten. Yet. Wilson connected with Marshawn Lynch and Jermaine Kearse - whose astonishing juggle put Seattle deep in New England’s territory - to move Seattle to two yards of defending their title.

Inexplicably, Seattle opted not to use the bow-legged Lynch to pound over, with Wilson’s pass intercepted by Malcolm Butler. Mayhem ensued. A flag was thrown, and referee Rob Ninkovich stood and watched as a brutal fight between Bruce Irvin and Michael Hoomanawanui unfurled.

Crazy.

But it didn’t start that way, with the seventh scoreless quarter flying by.

From the off, the Patriots drove up the field menacingly, controlling the clock with Swiss precision. Orchestrated by the calculating Brady and LaGarette Blount, they marched to Seattle’s 14.

Ominously lurking near the end zone, Brady assessed his options. But Jeremy Lane plucked his poor pass to Danny Amendola out of the air. The young cornerback broke his left arm in the process.

While Wilson showcased all of his elusive qualities, when he looked up, New England’s coverage wrapped up receivers was such that he no open target. That was to change.

Brady broke the deadlock with an 11-yard pass to Brandon LaFell, connecting with the wide open receiver with typical precision.

Befitting of a champion side, it seems that when their backs are up against the wall, the Seahawks really get going. Suddenly the shackles were off Wilson’s receiving corps. The world seemed to stop as he threw to his right and Chris Matthews’ magnificent leap beat Kyle Arrington to the ball deep in New England territory.

Lynch took over, pounding through the Patriots trenches. To deafening chants of ‘Beast’ he carried the ball first four, then three yards. Another three-yard charge levelled the score at seven apiece, but the exuberant 28-year-old did not grab his crotch in celebration.

With two minutes and 16 seconds on the clock, Brady hit back with a trademark two-minute drill. Seeing a mismatch in coverage, Gronkowski reined in his perfect 23-yard toss to put the Patriots ahead with 31 seconds remaining. A stunning drive from Brady, who moved 80 yards in one minute 45 seconds.

A body blow, surely? Not a bit of it. Seattle simply motored into action, with the tone set by running back Robert Turbin’s 19 yard rampage. Wilson picked up the baton, darting a further 17. The momentum visibly shifting, Seattle were handed a gift in the shape of 15 yards following Arrington’s face mask. From New England’s 21, Wilson again found Matthews, this time in the end zone. Astonishingly, Seattle were level.

Matthews and Wilson continued where they left off after the break, but New England’s defense held firm, restricting Seattle to Steven Haushka’s field goal. For the first time in the game, Seattle were ahead.

Brady was intercepted for the second time with Bobby Wagner picking him off and Seattle increased their lead to ten points as Doug Baldwin darted across the end zone to reel in Wilson’s floated pass to give Seattle a ten-point lead.

Surely the game was over. But Brady and the Patriots had other ideas.
