Pope Francis praised exorcists for 'helping those who suffer because of the work of the devil'

Pope Francis has given a special blessing to a convention of exorcists, praising them for 'helping those who suffer because of the work of the devil'.

The International Association of Exorcists brought some 300 members to Rome to discuss the impact of the occult and Satanism, which many of them fear is on the increase.

The Pope, who often speaks about the fight against Satan in his sermons, said by treating people who are possessed, exorcists demonstrate that 'the Church welcomes those suffering from the Devil's works'.

Speaking to Vatican Radio, Dr Valter Cascioli, a psychiatrist and spokesman for the International Association of Exorcists, warned of 'an extraordinary increase in demonic activity'.

He said that  this makes it even more worrying that 'the number of people who are turning to these practices, which are damaging psychologically, spiritually and morally, is constantly growing'.

The Association, which brings together Catholic priests and psychiatrists, was founded in 1990  and given formal recognition by the Vatican in June.

Dr Cascioli said that too many people today undervalue the temptation to engage in 'ordinary demonic activity', which leaves them unprepared to fight off greater attacks by the devil.

In societies marked by 'rushing, superficiality, exaggerated individualism and secularization,' he added, 'the battle against evil and the devil increasingly is becoming an emergency'.

At the convention, Father Aldo Buonaiuto blamed the phenomenon of Halloween for a spike in demonic possessions in October.

The organisation's emergency number receives hundreds of calls over this period, around 40 a day, especially from parents who fear that their child has been initiated into the occult, he said.

He added: 'Many say Halloween is a simple carnival, but in fact there is nothing innocent or fun about it - it is the antechamber to something much more dangerous.

'There are always more evil rituals, animal sacrifices, desecrations of cemeteries and thefts of sacred bones at the time of the 31 October.

Participating in Halloween is 'like an initiation into the occult', he said. 

'For the sects it is the best time of year to recruit new members. From here the door to the devil can be opened. For this reason its necessary for us to speak out and not play down the danger.'

To replace the 'dangerous' festival the Catholic Church in Italy have now launched the initiative 'Holyween', he said.

'While most people are seeped in zombies and horror we put on our door or windows a light or an image evocative of the saints. 

'And then there will be masses, prayer vigils and worship to celebrate the saints and victory of good over evil.'

At the conference, Pope Francis warned the exorcists that they must treat those possessed with 'kindness'.

He wrote in a message: 'Those who perform this particular ministry, in conjunction with the bishops' must work 'with love and kindness from the church towards those who suffer because of the evil one.' 

Last year, Pope Francis appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair-bound man who said he was possessed by the devil.

The Vatican insisted the pope 'didn't intend to perform any exorcism,' and it released a statement that said 'he simply intended to pray for someone who was suffering who was presented to him'.

The man later said that Francis had failed to banish the demons from his body. However, after Francis placed his hands on him, he was able to walk again, he claimed.

The exorcists' association was introduced in Italy by veteran exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, to share experience as increased interest in occult practices has boosted demand for exorcisms.

Fatherr Francesco Bamonte, an exorcist from the Diocese of Rome told official Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano that the Holy See’s approval of the group 'is cause for joy... for the church as a whole.'

'Exorcism is' in fact 'another form of charity' he said. 

The ancient rite of casting out Satan and his demons from the souls of the possessed has been carried out in the Catholic Church for centuries.

But the practice of exorcism saw a revival of interest following the 1973 film The Exorcist and other popular film and literature references.
