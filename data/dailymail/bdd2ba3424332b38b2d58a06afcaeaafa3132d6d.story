The world's most reproduced artwork is expected to sell for £500,000 at auction this spring.

Vladimir Tretchikoff's painting 'Chinese Girl' is one of the world's most recognisable images, one which can be found adroning walls in homes across the globe.

The painting of a stunning, young Asian woman with blue-green tinted skin, raven hair and ruby lips was painted by Tretchikoff in the early 1950s.

Tretchikoff brought the painting with him during a tour of the U.S. where it was bought by a woman in Chicago from the artist himself.

It has been in the same family ever since and is being sold by the original buyer's granddaughter at Bonham's South African art sale on 20th March in London where it is expected to fetch up to half a million pounds.

Tretchikoff , who died in 2006, claimed that by the end of his career he had sold half a million large-format reproductions of the 'Chinese Girl', also known as 'Green Lady', worldwide.

The real-life 'Chinese Girl', Monika Sing-Lee, was a 17-year-old girl who was working at her uncle's launderette in Sea Point, Cape Town.

Tretchikoff spotted her and asked her to model for him for which she was paid just over £130 in today's money for two weeks of work.

Giles Peppiatt, from Bonhams, said: ‘The iridescent hues of 'Chinese Girl' reflect Tretchikoff's experimentation with the possibilities of his colour palette, the green-blue patina-like effect of the sitter's face is uncanny, heightening the red of her lips and framed by her lustrous dark hair.

‘The deftly- handled golden hues and decorative detail of her tunic emerge from the lines of charcoal on brown canvas, a combination of media familiar from works like "Basotho Girl" and "Zulu Maiden".

‘Notably, the combination of lustrous golden silk and the blue-sheen of the model's skin combine to produce an otherworldly glow: a luminescence that is the leitmotif of Tretchikoff's best works.’

Boris Gorelik, author of the forthcoming book "Incredible Tretchikoff", said: ‘Millions of people - perhaps your parents or grandparents - bought a lithograph of this painting, hung it on their wall and admired it for years, if not decades.

'Maybe even you grew up looking at it. And today you can get the real thing - the original canvas. It's certainly fascinating.'
