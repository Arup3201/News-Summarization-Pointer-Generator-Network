A Syrian military helicopter clipped the tail of a Syrian passenger jet with 200 people aboard in mid-air Thursday, but the larger aircraft landed safely and no one aboard was hurt, Syria's state TV said.

The helicopter crashed near the capital of Damascus, though it was not clear if there were any casualties in that crash or what had led the two aircraft to touch in mid-air.

The close call came at a time when Syria is embroiled in a civil war between the supporters of President Bashar Assad and those trying to topple him.

The 18-month rebellion has claimed the lives of more than 23,000 people, according to activists, and Syria has descended into chaos.

The Syrian government has increasingly been using helicopters and other aircraft in its fight against the rebels.

Rebels have claimed to have shot down helicopters and warplanes in the past, although the regime has blamed most of the problems on mechanical difficulties.

Today Syrian military aircraft struck in the rebellious city of Aleppo, near to the border with Turkey, where many rebel groups have their strongholds.

A Syrian Army fighter was pictured dropping two bombs over the city's Bustan Al-Bashar district, followed by an explosion which sent plumes of smoke soaring into the sky.

In Thursday's incident, the helicopters rotor clipped the tail of a Syrian Arab Airlines jet, the state TV said.

The passenger plane 'landed safely at the airport and none of the 200 passengers were harmed,' the report said.

The helicopter crashed southeast of Douma, a Damascus suburb that has witnessed repeated military crackdowns to purge fighters seeking to topple Assad. No further details were made available.

'We heard the sound of several 
explosions and some gunfire, and a few minutes later, we were told that a
 helicopter had crashed,' said Mohammad Saeed, an activist in Douma.

This
 comes on the same day as the United Nations learned that Iran has been 
using civilian aircraft to fly military personnel and large quantities 
of weapons across Iraqi airspace to Syria to aid President Bashar 
al-Assad in his attempt to crush an 18-month uprising against his 
government, according to a Western intelligence report seen by Reuters.

Earlier
 this month, U.S. officials said they were questioning Iraq about 
Iranian flights in Iraqi airspace suspected of ferrying arms to Assad, a
 staunch Iranian ally.

On Wednesday, U.S. Senator John Kerry threatened to review U.S. aid to Baghdad if it does not halt such overflights.

Iraq says it does not allow the passage of any weapons through its airspace, but the intelligence report obtained by Reuters says Iranian weapons have been flowing into Syria via Iraq in large quantities. Such transfers, the report says, are organized by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

'This is part of a revised Iranian modus operandi that U.S. officials have only recently addressed publicly, following previous statements to the contrary,' said the report, a copy of which was provided by a U.N. diplomatic source.

'It also flies in the face of declarations by Iraqi officials,' it said. 'Planes are flying from Iran to Syria via Iraq on an almost daily basis, carrying IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) personnel and tens of tons of weapons to arm the Syrian security forces and militias fighting against the rebels.'

It added that Iran was also 'continuing to assist the regime in Damascus by sending trucks overland via Iraq' to Syria.

Although the specific charges about Iraq allowing Iran to transfer arms to Damascus are not new, the intelligence report alleges that the extent of such shipments is far greater than has been publicly acknowledged, and much more systematic, thanks to an agreement between senior Iraqi and Iranian officials.
