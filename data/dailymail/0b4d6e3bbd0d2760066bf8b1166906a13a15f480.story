After a hard day on the slopes, it's nice to have somewhere comfortable to unwind.

And skiers might find their recovery is somewhat faster with their own private masseuse at Chalet Edelweiss in Courcheval - a luxurious chalet boasting its own spa, cinema and nightclub for the ultimate apres ski.

As well as two personal chefs, two butlers and a private instructor, the five-star accommodation - available to rent at an eye-watering £330,000 a week - spans over seven floors and sleeps 24, and has a library and cinema.
