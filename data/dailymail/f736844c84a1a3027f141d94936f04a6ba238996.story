Costco has left itself open to fresh ridicule by putting the faux memoir of a cult film character in its 'non-fiction' section - weeks after labelling the Bible fiction.

Staff at a branch near to Los Angeles appeared to not realise that Ron Burgundy: Let Me Off At The Top was a work of comic fiction about Will Ferrell's cinema anchorman.

It comes after the retail chain was forced into a humbling apology after a Southern Californian pastor tweeted a photo showing copies of the Bible labelled as fiction.

Non-fiction: Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy in Anchorman. Costco has been left red faced after mislabelling the character's faux-memoir as 'non-fiction', weeks after outraging Christians by labelling the Bible fiction

That mistake had led some devout Christians to attempt to organise a boycott of Costco, which blamed the error on its distributor.

The latest gaffe was spotted by LA Times columnist Robin Abcarian on a recent visit to her local Costco.

But charitably she said she 'can't totally blame Costco for mislabelling' the book.

'The cover of this book sports a picture of a mega-mustachioed Will Ferrell, in character as San Diego’s fictional TV anchorman,' she wrote.

'If you aren’t a reader, don’t know anything about popular culture and perhaps haven’t been to the movies in a decade, it’s perfectly understandable that you might slap a “nonfiction” label on this faux memoir.

'Perhaps Costco, or its distributor, believes that Ron Burgundy is real.'

Fiction: Pastor Caleb Kaltenbach (right) was surprised to find Bibles at his local Costco labeled as 'Fiction'

Her sympathetic perspective was very different to the outrage from fundamentalist Christians over the mislabelled Bibles publicised by Simi Valley-based pastor Caleb Kaltenbach last month.

'Dear @Costco I'm sorry...But the #HolyBible is not fiction. I will not be buying your goods as a result. #BoycottCostco,' wrote Dan Trigona on the micro-blogging website.

Domenica DeSantis added: 'very disappointed in costco stores. a bible should NEVER be in the fiction section. my faith is not "fictional" thank you. #smh.'

The chain quickly apologised for the label, saying that a distributor had made a mistake on a small batch of the Bibles and that they would be immediately addressing the issue.

'We take responsibility and should have caught the mistake. We are correcting this with them for future distribution,' Costco said. 'We greatly apologize for the error.'
