An end-of-exams party held at a £1million country house descended into a riot when 150 gatecrashers turned up after reading about it on Facebook.

Jacob Little, 17, posted a private invitation to the event on the social networking site – expecting only his friends to turn up.

What was supposed to be a private gathering soon descended into chaos, with unwelcome guests turning up in droves. His parents, who were on holiday, had given their son permission to host a small celebration at their house in Copthorne, Surrey.

A party organised via Facebook turned into 'a riot' at a secluded guest house after 150 gatecrashers turned up

Police - reportedly armed with tasers and batons - tried to contain a mob of teenagers at the party as it descended into chaos

The
teenager who organised the private party admitted it had 'just got out 
of hand' while one reveller compared the chaos the night descended into 
as 'just like Project X' - a comedy film about a debauched teen house 
party.

A police helicopter was scrambled along with cars, dog handlers and officers armed with batons and tasers as they struggled to bring the party - believed to have been organised to celebrate the end of GCSE exams - under control.

Missiles were hurled at officers and several police cars were damaged, and a female officer also had to be treated by paramedics after she was injured in the fray.

It is believed neighbours had called police after becoming concerned at the volume and the growing numbers of guests.

Jacob Little said: 'The Facebook group that I set up to invite people was set to private, which, to be honest, I thought would be fine to make sure only people I wanted there came.

'But it was gate-crashed by people I didn't know. The police said that people were here from as far away as Guildford, but people from Crawley were here too, which was weird because most of the people that I invited were college friends from Haywards Heath.'

The student added: 'From what I have heard the people who gate-crashed were bottling people (police) and chanting songs.

'People were standing in the road at the front of the house and calling up other people to invite others to come.

'It just got out of hand and when police arrived I was told to get everyone I wanted to stay, inside the house.'

Jacob's parents were abroad in Poland at the time on holiday when the party was held, with their permission, at the large property.

Police were called in by Jacob's 
furious father, Tony Little, who telephoned from Poland after a 
neighbour he had asked to keep an eye on the property alerted him to 
what was going on.

One of the 17-year-olds who attended the party said he found out via Facebook.

He said: 'It was bad. There wasn’t any trouble until the police turned up. Then people kicked off and it all got out of hand.

'There were probably about 30 police cars and  a couple of people got bitten by dogs. Then the helicopter turned up.

'The police came about 11pm but the riot was still going on until 2am.

'We had a mate who wasn’t drinking so was driving, but we couldn’t get out of the house and back on the lane to get to his car.

'People were throwing bottles. We had to hide under a table out of the way. It was bad. 

The party took place on a private estate outside the village of Copthorne, on the Surrey and West Sussex borders

When the MailOnline contacted the 
house - owned by Sally Smyth and Tony Little - someone claiming to be Ms
Smyth's son said they 'were still away'.

He
insisted it had not been his party but added: 'My parents are still 
away. You have no idea how much damage this is causing us.'

A Surrey Police spokesman said three arrests had been made and they were still appealing for witnesses.

Some of the party goers claim they were bitten by police dogs during the riot - which reportedly continued for three hours

The party was held at a guest house which was used for Gatwick airport passengers in Domewood, a private estate on the Surrey and West Sussex borders

Inspector Paul Grove, said: 'This 
incident demonstrates the dangers which police officers face on a daily 
basis and a full investigation will now follow to find those responsible
for the disturbance in a bid to bring them to justice.

'Surrey 
Police will not tolerate such violent behaviour against officers and 
members of the public and thankfully no-one was seriously injured.

'I would urge anyone who has information on this incident to contact 
officers and any information passed to us will be treated in the 
strictest of confidence.'

The scenes from the party were compared to film Project X (pictured) a comedy about a debauched teenage house party which gets out of control

Project X follows three unpopular American high school seniors as they attempt to finally make a name for themselves with the party 

Teenagers who claimed to have attended the party have been discussing the night on Twitter.

One wrote: 'That kid's life will be hell for a good year. I wonder if he got any sleep last night ha ha.'

Another added that they could now tick a 'riot off my bucket list.'
