Alex Salmond will force left-wing policies on Tory England if the SNP hold the balance of power after the next election, he boasted today.

The former First Minister, who is standing for Parliament in May, said he would work with other parties except the Tories to 'see more progressive politics introduced across these islands'.

Mr Salmond also refused to rule out becoming Deputy Prime Minister in a Labour-SNP Coalition – but said it was more likely that his party would prop up Ed Miliband in return for more powers for Scotland, a hike in the minimum wage and scrapping Britain's nuclear deterrent.

Former First Minister Alex Salmond said he would work with other parties except the Tories to 'see more progressive politics introduced across these islands'

The remarks came after Labour's election strategist Douglas Alexander failed to rule out a coalition with the SNP if Mr Miliband failed to win an outright majority.

The shadow foreign secretary was repeatedly pressed on whether Labour would do a deal with Nicola Sturgeon's party but said he was 'not going to play that game'.

But Mr Alexander insisted Labour would not be held to ransom over the renewal of Trident – the nuclear weapons system which needs replacing.

He said: 'As a prospective foreign secretary in an incoming Labour government the responsibility of defending this country is not something that is the subject of simply trading away interests one way or another.'

'Our position on Trident is very clear and I'm not changing it,' he added.

Mr Salmond told Sky News's Dermot Murnaghan programme the SNP would 'progress the Scottish interest' in any negotiations.

The Tories put out an election poster last week claiming Ed Miliband could be propped up in Number 10 by the SNP and Sinn Fein

With Labour looking increasingly unlikely to win enough seats to form a majority after the election, both the Lib Dems and the SNP could hold the balance of power. 

Business Secretary Vince Cable today insisted he could happily work with Labour in the national interest.

He said: 'I’ve worked with a team of Tory ministers, we don’t agree on a lot of things, but we work as a business-like team and I would a adopt the same approach to the Labour party. 

'There are things in policy terms we do agree about and support for the industrial strategy is a good example, taxation of higher value properties is another. 

'I think we have a more flexible approach to borrowing for good investment than the Tories do. 

'We’ve always taken the view we are happy to work with other parties in the national interest.' 

He said that would mean, 'in particular' winning more powers for Holyrood.

He said the SNP would have to 'enforce the delivery of the vow, the promise that was made to Scotland of home rule, neo-federalism, devo-to-the-max in these last desperate days of the referendum campaign'.

But he added: 'There's also an area where the SNP, in conjunction with allies in Plaid Cymru in Wales and the Green Party in England will want to see more progressive politics introduced across these islands.

'For example, instead of another bout of austerity from Labour or Conservatives, the cancellation of the renewal of the Trident missile system, and diverting that funding, £30bn over the next ten years, into health and education and to something useful and productive.

'And I think that will have a lot of support in England as well as in Scotland.'

Asked whether he would support Ed Miliband, perhaps by serving as deputy prime minister, Mr Salmond said a formal coalition was 'unlikely'.

He said: 'Nicola Sturgeon's laid this out very clearly. What we've ruled out is any deal with the Conservative party, formal or informal.

'I think Nicola said that a formal coalition is unlikely. We're not ruling it out. But it would be unlikely.

'The best way to affect change is to negotiate on a vote-by-vote basis. And the things we're negotiating is delivery of the vow to Scotland, the cancellation of the renewal of the Trident system, and support for progressive politics, for progressive causes, things like the living wage across these islands.'

Mr Salmond predicted another hung Parliament after the election – with no party holding enough seats to form a majority.

He said: 'Nothing's certain in life or politics. But a balanced parliament looks pretty likely at the present moment.

'That looks like the most likely outcome. I'm hardly surprised because who'd want to give either David Cameron or Ed Miliband a majority?

'I don't think either of them is worth it. So a balanced parliament looks like the favourite at the present moment but nothing is certain.'

Mr Alexander conceded the 'polls are tough' for Labour but insisted the party was fighting for a majority.

He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'The polls are tough, but the fact is after the referendum there were a very significant constituency in Scotland who want change. I share that appetite for change.

'In the coming election in May the way that we can secure that change is not to split the centre left vote but to deliver the maximum number of Labour MPs and, thereby, make sure we have a progressive government not a government led by David Cameron or a government of David Cameron and Nigel Farage.'
