The music has started and the party’s begun as thousands of young revellers get into the festival spirit at Reading and Leeds Festival.

Fans dressed in bright wellies and spectacular headdresses have been parading the campsites in Berkshire and Yorkshire at the simultaneous rock event, which happens every August bank holiday weekend.

And Reading is preparing for Friday night’s headline act Queens of the Stone Age while Blink-182 will be at Leeds – kicking off the first full night of live music.

The 19-year-old woman told police she was attacked in a caravan in the traders’ area last night, after meeting a man and a boy near an ice cream van in one of the campsites.

Police are patrolling the site and said there have been 21 crime reports since the gates opened on Wednesday, including five alleged drugs offences and 13 suspected thefts.
