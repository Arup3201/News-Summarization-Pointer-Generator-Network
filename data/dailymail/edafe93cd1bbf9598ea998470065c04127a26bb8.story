 A lowly insurance clerk passed himself off as a Royal Marine and lived at a top-security military base just yards from Buckingham Palace for two years, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Office worker Anthony Phillips, 42, convinced soldiers at Wellington Barracks – where troops who guard the Queen are based – that he was an elite commando. In fact, he was a pen-pusher who was living a fantasy life inside the base.

Father-of-three Phillips was so convincing that soldiers from the Coldstream Guards who were living there nicknamed him ‘Tony the Marine’ and shared classified details about protecting the Royals and conducting ceremonial duties.

Convincing: Anthony Phillips passed himself off as a member of the Armed Forces and got to live at Wellington Barracks

Phillips, who wore a Royal Marines tie and a lapel button embossed with the Corps’ globe and laurel insignia, first appeared at the barracks, on Birdcage Walk, in the run-up to the London Olympics in July 2012.

At a time when the UK was on high alert against a terror attack, Phillips convinced senior soldiers he was a commando sent to London to work at the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

While a telephone call to the Royal Marines would have revealed Phillips was bogus, he was given his own room with a bathroom in a soldiers’ accommodation block, which he lived in until March this year.

Phillips became a familiar face at the barracks, where he built up his reputation as a tough Royal Marine who did physical training with other soldiers and socialised with them in their bars on the base.

In fact, Phillips was a clerk working at the MoD in Whitehall whose job was to calculate the cost of insuring soldiers on exercises and missions.

He had undergone low-level security checks but had no right to live on the base. MoD personnel like Phillips would normally be escorted whenever they visited a high-security military base, but he could come and go as he pleased.

Last night, an MP on the defence select committee demanded an urgent inquiry into the security breach.

Labour’s Gisela Stuart said: ‘This case is a wake-up call for the new Defence Secretary who should look closely at what happened, because the implications of the case are very serious.

‘If you consider the heightened vulnerability of London since the 7/7 attacks in 2005, and the fact that he moved in at the time of the 2012 Olympics when everyone was supposed to be on their guard, how he got in and was able to stay inside the base is very worrying.

‘The MoD must look again at its gate-keepers, its vetting and levels of access.’

The MoD has refused to explain how Phillips tricked his way into the barracks, but The Mail on Sunday has established that a sergeant major who left the Coldstream Guards last year was recently called back to answer questions during an investigation into the scandal.

A family source close to Phillips said he was exposed when checks were carried out after a noisy party. Phillips was booted off the barracks and resigned from the Civil Service, avoiding a disciplinary hearing.

And while defence sources say he defrauded the taxpayer by living there for free, there are no plans to force him to pay accommodation charges. His current whereabouts are unknown.

Impersonating a member of the Armed Forces is no longer an offence, but those who pass themselves off as members of the Armed Forces for financial gain can be charged with fraud. Phillips has not been accused of any criminal offence.

Family sources suggested last night that Phillips may have been motivated by his father Wilfred, who served as a commando in the Second World War, and died in 1985.

Last night an MoD spokesman said: ‘When it became clear that there was no entitlement to accommodation, this individual was asked to leave Wellington Barracks.

‘It is wrong and misleading to suggest this was a security breach. The individual in question was an MoD employee with the correct security clearances and passes to allow entry to any MoD establishment.’
