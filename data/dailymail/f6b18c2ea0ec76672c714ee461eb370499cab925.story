A grandmother claims her parrot has saved her life after she developed a life-threatening illness that stops her breathing while asleep.

Barbara Smith-Schafer, 62, says the bird wakes her up by frantically flapping his wings and gnawing her shoulder.

Even more astonishingly, Dominic, a seven-year-old African Grey, is also bi-lingual, and can speak English and German, she says.

Not so bird-brained: Barbara with her loyal parrot Dominic, who flaps and gnaws her shoulder to wake her when she nods off

Mrs Smith-Schafer, from Skegness, Lincolnshire, suffers from sleep apnoea, an illness that stops her breathing when she is asleep.

It can put a strain on the heart and cause serious health conditions such as stroke.

The pensioner first noticed something was wrong in 2009, when she brought Dominic indoors after he was being bullied by another of her seven pet parrots.

Sleep apnoea is characterised by loud
and heavy snoring, which she says alerted Dominic to the problem.

She told MailOnline: 'I 
wondered why he kept sitting on my shoulder and pecking at me.

'At first I was quite annoyed - he kept waking me up and I found it embarrassing as he would also mimic my snoring.

'But he 
must have realised something was wrong and was trying to keep me awake.'

'He has kept me alive. He really is one in a million.'

And
that's not the end of Dominic's talents. The exotic bird also speaks 
German after learning some words from her German-born husband Bernhard -
although this has led to some embarrassing moments.

'My husband would sometimes say 'oh scheisse' when he was on the computer, and Dominic started saying it.

'If visitors heard him I would pretend he was talking about how nice it was outside.'

Dominic, who could live to 60, has also helped Barbara tackle her fear of birds.

'The other parrots are really my husbands,' the mother-of-three said

'I
will feed them if I have to but otherwise I don't go near them. But 
with Dominic it is different. He liked me straight away because I was a
woman.

'He sits on my 
shoulder during meal times and really likes peas and sweetcorn. He will 
be getting an extra special Christmas box this year, he really is a 
darling.'

Barbara was diagnosed with sleep apnoea in 2009 after suffering from nocturnal incontinence.

'I
was getting up three to four times a night having wet myself.

The NHS suggests the following lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of OSA :

'I thought
that I had something wrong with my bladder and at first doctors 
were looking at Botox, but then one American doctor said it could be 
sleep apnoea, which I had never heard of before.'

A
visit to an overnight clinic confirmed that Mrs Smith-Schafer did have 
the condition. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a potentially 
life-threatening sleep disorder. It causes a person's airway to collapse
during sleep, obstructing breathing for pauses of 10 seconds or more.

This can occur several times in the night and leaves sufferers exhausted
as it jolts them out of deep sleep. It also puts a strain on the heart 
and can lead to serious conditions including stroke.

It
also explains why the former canteen-worker had suffered with 
extreme tiredness for so long. She had found herself drifting off even 
when she was standing up and pitched headfirst into the coffee table. .

As
a result she had broken her nose five times along with suffering a 
fractured shoulder and other bumps and bruises.

Mrs Smith-Schafer has now been prescribed a Philips CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway
Pressure) machine, which provides a gentle flow of air
pressure through her nose using a mask. The air pressure prevents airway
collapse, allowing her to breathe freely during sleep.

'For the first time in a long time, I feel like I can see light
at the end of the tunnel, and have got some of my mobility back after years of
feeling too tired to get off the couch,' she said.

She now finds she doesn't nod off so often during the day, which means Dominic can take a step back from guard duty.

'I’m grateful to
Dominic for keeping an eye on me, but I certainly won’t miss the painful alarm
calls or his mocking my snoring,' she said.

Mr Michael 
Oko, Consultant ENT Surgeon and Sleep Apnoea Specialist at Pilgrim 
Hospital, Lincolnshire, who diagnosed Mrs Smith-Schafer, said: 'All too 
often, chronic snoring is viewed as a harmless phenomenon, albeit an 
extremely annoying one for the snorer’s bed-partner.

'But
for up to one in five who do snore, the cause will be OSA, which if 
left untreated can lead to significant cardiovascular damage and hypoxia
of the brain.

'Fortunately,
for those of us without the helping hand of a uniquely talented parrot,
there are some highly effective treatments, including lifestyle and 
behaviour changes, CPAP therapy, mandibular advancement devices and 
surgery.

'If you experience heavy snoring and suffer significant fatigue and tiredness, it’s important that you report it to your doctor immediately.'

Sleep apnoea has traditionally been viewed as a male disease, but a recent study has suggested that among women
aged 20-44, up to one quarter now suffer from it, a figure which 
rises to more than half in women aged between 45 and 54, and 75 per cent
in women aged between 55 and 70.

'More women should go and get checked,' Mrs Smith-Schafer said.

'I thought it was my bladder but Dominic knew otherwise. I wish I had his brains.'
