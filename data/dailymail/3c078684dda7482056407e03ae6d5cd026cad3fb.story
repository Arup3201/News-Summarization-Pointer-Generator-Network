Fernando, the player Manchester City have bought to irritate opponents in the depths of their midfield, breaks into a smile when he considers his nickname ‘The Octopus’.

For fans at his former club Porto it appeared he had eight legs, such was the frequency he flicked the ball away from advancing attackers.

That the match which first saw the £12million Brazilian called as such came against Manchester United should instantly warm the hearts of those on the blue half. In April 2009 Fernando provided the sting to Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney as United were held to a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in the Champions League.

‘It was during that game that the Porto fans nicknamed me The Octopus,’ says Fernando through a translator. ‘At the time Manchester United had a very strong team. They had Cristiano Ronaldo and Rooney was playing really well.

‘I played really well and stole quite a lot of balls and that’s when the Porto fans started calling me The Octopus. It was as if I had a lot of legs!’

It can be argued that legs in the defensive third of the pitch is what Manuel Pellegrini’s midfield lacked at times last season. Yaya Toure would stride forward to devastating effect without particular concern to tracking back, while Fernandinho is a box-to-box player keen to attack.

Fernando will sit deep and provide steel, especially when the big games roll around and solidity is imperative. ‘I have a very strong defensive game and that is going to help us a lot because teams will take advantage of City being so attacking, on the counter-attack. I’m going to add very good value in that sense.

‘There are some great players here. But every day that goes on I have to work hard in order to get my spot. I know my strengths and will work hard to make sure I’m first choice.’

Fernando, 27, has been overlooked by his country ever since he was suspended for a year after pushing over a referee during an Under-20 match against Chile, who featured a young Alexis Sanchez.

He has calmed since then but there are no fears the Premier League might prove too tough. He holds a Portuguese passport having moved to Porto in 2007 and this year he tried to play for his adopted home only for FIFA to rule a match he played at youth level counted as competitive, preventing a switch of allegiances.

Fernando watched Brazil’s humbling 7-1 defeat to Germany at the World Cup – a match in which Fernandinho was replaced at halftime – and says ‘naturally’ when asked if he could have reinforced the team. 

‘There were many errors,’ he adds. ‘But obviously I didn’t have the opportunity to play so we will never know. No Brazilian expected that the score would be like that. That’s something that’s going to be marked in the history of Brazilian football.’

Of the incident in January 2007 which saw him branded a black sheep in Brazil he says: ‘I was very young at the time and it was a hot-headed moment. I was playing really well and it was something that really marked my career. Obviously that has prevented me from going further in the Brazilian team. I don’ t think that’s the only reason but I think that had a factor.

‘It was a moment I learned a lot from. It put me in good stead for these days. Now I always try to be calm and tranquil on the pitch and not speak back to the referee.’

Fernando will compete with Fernandinho for a place, but they might also play together, representing something of a commentator’s nightmare. They even look alike.

Their team-mates have already devised a way to differentiate. ‘I think they are calling Fernandinho “Fay” and calling me “Nando”,’ he says with a smile. 

Fernando was speaking at Manchester City’s Community Shield Media Day at Carrington, where he joined in to helped the Club’s Community Coaches train children from local schools and sports clubs in a free soccer school.
