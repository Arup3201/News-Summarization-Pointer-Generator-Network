A 25-year-old man has been charged with assault and intent to rob following the attack on 4ft 6in disabled pensioner Alan Barnes. 

Richard Gatiss, 25, was arrested early this morning and he will appear at Gateshead Magistrates' Court tomorrow.

Frail Mr Barnes, 67, was pushing his bin outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, earlier this month when he was knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed.

The committed Christian, who weighs six stone, said at the time: 'Someone just jumped on me. It all happened in a very short time. I would like to see him caught because he might do it again.'

Katie Cutler set up a fund to help disabled pensioner Alan Barnes after he was attacked in the street

The fund exceeded all expectation and has now been stopped at the request of Mr Barnes and his family after it topped more than £329,526

Following the assault 21-year-old beautician Katie Cutler set up an online fund which generated £330,135 for Mr Barnes and the pair have since become friends.

The disabled pensioner, who  has suffered from sight and growth problems since birth, said he was overwhelmed by the response from well-wishers across the globe.

'I am totally overwhelmed and incredibly grateful to Katie for what she has done for me,' he said.

'The youth of today don't always get portrayed in a positive light, but I won't ever forget what this young woman has done for me. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

'I always knew there were good people in the world, and this has confirmed it.' 

The donations mean he can buy a house of his own for the first time and not count the pennies to get through the week.

More than 24,748 well-wishers donated at an average of just over £13 each, but the appeal has now been halted.

Ms Cutler wrote on the Alan Barnes Fund page last week saying: 'Good morning, after speaking with Alan & his family, they have asked me to stop any further donations to his fund.

'He is very grateful for all your love, support & donations. We will be having a little presentation to hand him his cheque so i'll keep you all updated. X' 

Gateshead Area Commander Chief Superintendent Andy McDyer said: 'I'd like to reassure people that since this happened we've been relentless in our investigation and in following up lines of enquiry.

'In the early hours of Monday officers made an arrest in connection with the investigation and this man has now been charged and is progressing through the court process.'

Mr Barnes weighs just six stone and stands at just 4ft 6in after being born with sight and growth problems.
