PC Neil Doyle died after being attacked on the street during a work night out in Liverpool 

Two more people have been arrested by police investigating the murder of newly wed policeman Neil Doyle who died after being attacked in the street.  

A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender on Christmas Eve, following the incident in Liverpool last Friday.

Andrew Taylor, 28, and Christopher Spendlove, 30, were charged with the 36-year-old's murder earlier this week.

Mr Doyle, who recently married, was on a work night out when he was assaulted. Police previously said they believed his attackers knew the officers were off-duty policemen. 

Last night a 24-year-old woman and 29-year-old man from Liverpool were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Mr Doyle married only five months ago and he and wife Sarah, 37, had booked a belated honeymoon for the new year.

Mrs Doyle said in a statement: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all.

'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.'

The couple were married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month.

Speaking last week, Sir Jon Murphy, Merseyside's Chief Constable, said: 'Constable Doyle was enjoying a Christmas night out with his work colleagues.

'They were subjected to an apparently unprovoked and vicious attack by a group of males. 

'There is no indication whatsoever that they were involved in any kind of argument or altercation earlier in the evening.

'The officer I have spoken to has indicated that the individuals who approached them referred to them as police officers.

Investigation: The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am following the officers' Christmas party at a pub. Above, officers at the scene on Friday

Vicious: Bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive the man before paramedics arrived. A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. Above, officers at the scene

'They then assaulted the officers, leaving two with nasty head injuries and resulting in the tragic death of Neil.'

The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am following the officers' Christmas party at a pub.

The attackers vanished when it became clear that Mr Doyle was seriously hurt.

Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived.

A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain.

Sir Jon said the constable was a patrol officer who had served with the force for ten years.

He had won a commendation for arresting three violent robbers.

The Chief Constable said it was a 'sad day' for Merseyside police and sent his 'heartfelt condolences' to Mrs Doyle and the officer's family.
