A controversial website encourages heart-broken women to publicly name and shame the 'home wreckers' who led their husbands or boyfriends to cheat.

Shesahomewrecker.com lists over 500 'mistresses' from across the U.S. with their name, location and photograph on full view. Profiles also include the 'juicy details' surrounding each affair.

For example, one entry features a photograph of an Iowa-based woman - described as a 'home wrecking s***' - cuddled up to a user's husband. An accompanying description reads: 'She will never have his heart like I did. EVER. I will love that man until the day I die.

Getting revenge: A controversial website called Shesahomewrecker.com encourages heart-broken women to publicly name and shame the 'home wreckers' who led their husbands and boyfriends to cheat

The cheated-on woman continues: 'I just wish home wreckers like her would think about their “boyfriends” families before themselves.

'Thanks to her, my daughter only sees her daddy every other weekend and my oldest daughter does not see him anymore.'

Another photo, exposing a 'home wrecker' in Georgia, features the caption: 'What is really to say? A pathetic excuse for a female. Knowingly, continuing to try and bed a man that is taken.'

'Thanks to her, my daughter only sees her daddy every other weekend and my oldest daughter does not see him anymore'

Meanwhile, a mother-of-two writes about 
how her 'perfect marriage' was ruined because her husband decided to 
join a gym, where he met another woman.

'Little by little he became more distant and changed so much. The gym made him a different person,' she recalls.

So
 far, the state with the highest number of reported 'home wreckers' on 
the website is Texas, with 168 cases, followed by California with 152, 
while Vermont has only one entry and Alaska two.

Popular: The site has attracted almost 250,000 Facebook 'Likes' since launching last year

The
 majority of women appear to have found out about their partners' 
affairs after checking cell phones, email and social networking 
accounts such as Facebook and Instagram.

While Shesahomewrecker.com has a firm
 fan base, attracting almost 250,000 Facebook 'Likes' since its launch 
last year, critics have deemed it 'mean-spirited', 'horrific' and 
'disgusting'.

'What a horrific website this is! The hatred, fury and violent comments are appalling'

Indeed, a woman named 'Daisy' writes on the site: 'What a horrific website this is!
 I am amazed it hasn’t been reported and taken down yet.  

'If someone 
located and physically harmed one of the women whose photos you post up 
here, would you accept responsibility?

'The
 hatred, fury and violent comments on this site are appalling, and you 
should be ashamed that you are practically inciting hatred and violence 
by publishing these photos.

'I am not a home wrecker (my God what a 1950s term). In fact, my husband
 left me for someone else but you know what? Yes I was heartbroken but 
after a good deal of soul searching I understood that I had contributed 
to the failure of the marriage as much as he had.

Mapped out: So far, the state with the highest number of reported 'home wreckers' on the website is Texas, with 168 cases, followed by California with 152, while Vermont has only one entry and Alaska two

'It
 would never occur to me in a million years to post her picture and 
details online because grown-up adults don’t need to resort to the 
online bullying tactics of hormonal 13-year old girls.'

And a Change.org petition launched in summer requested for the site to be 'dismantled.'

An
 accompanying statement read: 'Women are being harassed, slander is 
occurring and lives are being ruined due to the cyber bullying taking 
place on this site.'

'At the end of the day, the main complaint should be with the partner who cheated, not the person he or she cheated with'

However, with only 66 signatures the Baltimore-based site, set up by a woman named Ariella Alexander, continues to operate and a spinoff, called Hesahomewrecker.com, is set to launch this month.

'Now
 taking submissions for the cheating MAN that broke your heart!!! 
Hesahomewrecker.com will be launching in a few days!! Get your story in 
now!!!' an announcement reads on the website.

This news will satisfy those who have criticized Shesahomewrecker.com for laying the blame on women instead of 'cheating men'.

'At the end of the day, the main complaint should be with the partner who cheated, not the person he or she cheated with,' one women mused on Jezebel.com.
