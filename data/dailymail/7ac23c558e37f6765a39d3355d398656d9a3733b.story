MPs last night called for an urgent investigation into the Tony Blair spy chief who stands to gain from Britain’s biggest ever defence deal.

Sir John Scarlett, who played a key role in the dodgy dossier on Saddam Hussein’s weapons, is lobbying the Government in support of the  £28billion merger.

He now works for Morgan Stanley, which is advising BAE Systems on its proposed merger with European rival EADS.

The investment bank is in line to make millions if the deal goes ahead and MPs want to know how much Sir John, who left MI6 in October 2009, will gain personally from lobbying his former colleagues.

Insiders say the 64 year old is ‘liaising’ between the bank and the Government to help ‘soothe concerns’ in No 10 about the deal.

Critics of the tie-up say handing control of BAE to a company in part controlled by the French and German governments will undermine national security, lead to the closure of key defence facilities in the UK and destroy Britain’s military and intelligence relationship with the US.

Details of Sir John’s involvement have reinforced the notion that the deal – which has David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s support – is being stitched together by the Whitehall establishment.

MPs have already demanded the chance to question Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, who has been pushing the deal with the Prime Minister and has had a series of meetings with BAE and the bank.

He worked for four years at Morgan Stanley and MPs are concerned he has a conflict of interest by promoting the deal in Downing Street.

The Cabinet Office confirmed yesterday that Sir John was banned from lobbying government for a period of a year following his last day of his service. But now that has expired he is clear to call his old contacts.

He and Sir Jeremy face being dragged before the Commons defence select committee, which is investigating the BAE deal.

Sir Bob Russell, the senior Liberal Democrat on the committee, said Sir John should be called to give evidence and forced to answer questions about how much he will personally profit from the deal.

‘I have serious concerns about the merger, both from a defence point of view and for job reasons,’ he said.

‘I am of the view that there’s too cosy an arrangement between former ministers and civil servants becoming consultants when they leave government.

‘I’d prefer it if the time limit on them going into lobbying was ten years, not one. The public perception is that people like this are using the contacts they gained as ministers and civil servants.

‘If Sir John is trying to use the influence he has to skew a decision he ought to come before us so someone can ask who much he is being paid and whether he stands to get a personal bonus if the deal goes through.’

Ben Wallace, the Tory MP who is coordinating Commons opposition to the deal, said Sir John was a poor choice for BAE.

‘The last thing the defence industry needs is the overseer of the dodgy dossier to be lobbying on your behalf,’ he said.

He said Sir John had no track record in the aerospace industry and ‘wasn’t a particularly stunning success as a civil servant’.

A senior civil servant also expressed doubts, saying: ‘There are lots of people prepared to offer former ministers and mandarins large sums of money because they think they know how to open doors. I’m not sure they always represent very good value for money.

Every day that passes after they leave, they are a day less plugged in to the people and the way things are done.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman said Sir John had complied fully with the Business Appointment Rules.

His appointment with Morgan Stanley in March 2010 was approved on the advice of the independent advisory committee.’

Sir Jeremy Heywood, who holds extraordinary influence inside No 10, finds himself dragged into controversy over his former business interests for the second time in barely a year.

The cause of his trouble last year was the disaster which stuck the Southern Cross care homes group. And, as with the latest row over defence giant BAE, it concerned his time spent as a senior manager at the investment bank Morgan Stanley.

Southern Cross, which looked after 31,000 frail elderly people at the height of its success, was bought by the US private equity firm Blackstone in 2004.

Influence: Sir Jeremy finds himself dragged into controversy over his former business interests for the second time in barely a year

Blackstone floated it on the stock market two years later and sold all its shares in 2007 – taking a huge profit.

But the flotation, which had been based upon the sale and lease-back of the company’s homes, left Southern Cross in a hugely precarious state by saddling it with expensive long-term rent commitments.

When the economy downturn came, it could no longer afford to pay many of its bills – leaving the elderly and their relatives fearing they would be evicted.

Sir Jeremy was safely inside Downing Street as ministers wrestled with trying to find a solution to this mess in the summer of 2011.

But, in a huge personal embarrassment to the mandarin, a report by the GMB union revealed the controversial stock market flotation had been guided by Morgan Stanley, at a time when he was co-head of UK investment banking between 2004 and 2007, during a break from the civil service.

The bank advised Blackstone on the float, informing it of stock exchange rules, helping draw up a prospectus, setting the share sale price and attracting investors.

Morgan Stanley is believed to have shared in a £10million fee with other advisers, including Swiss bank UBS.

Although Mr Heywood did not work directly on the Southern Cross deal, he was the ultimate boss of the team that managed it.

It was never made clear how much, if any, of a personal bonus Sir Jeremy was paid for overseeing the Southern Cross float in 2006. However banking sources said he would have been handsomely rewarded.

Justin Bowden, a national officer at the GMB, said the civil servant was in the Southern Cross scandal ‘up to his neck’.

Ros Altmann of over-50s group Saga said: ‘I am absolutely staggered someone involved in this can be so influential in No 10.’

Sir Jeremy was brought back to government by Gordon Brown in 2007. He became involved in rumours that he was the source for journalist Andrew Rawnsley’s claims that Mr Brown bullied his staff.

It was he who apparently emailed No 10 workers to inform them of their rights if they were treated badly.

Since Mr Brown’s departure from  No 10, the father-of-three’s career has flourished.

He is said to have a very close working relationship with David Cameron – with some Tory MPs being concerned that he has far too much sway.

In particular, he has been embroiled in a series of rows over Iain Duncan Smith’s plan to ‘make work pay’ by shaking up the benefits system.

Sir Jeremy is reported to have said he was ‘sceptical’ about the plan for a universal benefit – language which was seen as an attempt by the civil service to derail the flagship policy.

He is also understood to be part of a cabal of Downing Street and Treasury advisers which has been pressing Mr Cameron to water down his commitment to reduce net migration to tens of thousands a year.
