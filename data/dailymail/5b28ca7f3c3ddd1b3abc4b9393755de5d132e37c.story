Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi continues to languish in a Mexican jail after being arrested for accidentally taking guns across the border

A friend of a marine with PTSD being 
held in Mexican prison for gun charges said that his friend is being 
'treated like a prisoner of war'

Marine Mark Podlaski spoke with Greta 
Van Susteran on Fox news and said that his jailed friend Andrew 
Tahmooresi spoke to him on the phone last week from Mexican prison and 
told him he was 'chained naked to a bed' along with other 'disturbing 
details.'

Tahmooressi was detained by Mexican Authorities on March 31 after he accidentally crossed the border with guns in his car.

Podlaski told Fox that Mexico is supposed to be an ally on the United States and said it's 'absurd' that they are treating Tahmooressi so poorly.

Podlaski said that his captured friend described being beaten by a bat so britally that his jaw was broken. He was also chained naked to a bed.

'This is from his mouth, what I'm telling you right now is what he endured as an American citizen and a U.S. Marine,' Podlaski told Van Susteren.

'he was chained to his bed for so long that when they finally released him at the end of that four weeks he couldn't even walk, he was crippled from such bad muscle dystrophy and joint pain and not being able to fire the muscles in his body,' he added.

After his arrest, Tahmooressi's family hired a private investigator to investigate the case further.

Santos told Fox that the torture was inflicted before Tahmooressi's  mother went to the media.

Tahmooressi's best friend Mark Podlaski told reporters that his friend is being treated 'like a prisoner of war'

The 25-year old U.S. marine veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan, was detained and jailed by Mexican authorities late March after he drove across the Tijuana border with three U.S.-registered guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition

The treatment allegedly started after Tahmooressi had his first hearing for the case.

He has since fired his attorney Alejandro Osuna who allegedly instructed him to lie and say that he had never been to Tiajuana.

Tahmooressi had in fact been to Tiajuana six times after his detention.

A spokesman for Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. who's involved in the case said that an April 6 email exchange between Osuna and Tahmooressi's family states Osuna told Tahmooressi to 'stick to the script, and keep it short and simple' by saying he had never been to Tijuana.

'Andrew kept insisting he wanted to change it, but our concern was that if he mentioned he had been in Tijuana about six times prior to his detention (which seems to be the case), his story would have been less credible,' Osuna wrote in the email, obtained by FoxNews.com.

Tahmooressi says he wants to 'set the record straight' after 'being instructed to lie.'

Tahmooressi was represented by a court appointed temporary lawyer at a Wednesday hearing.

Osuna confirmed with reporters that he'd been fired but said he didn't instruct his client to lie.
