A former consultant who helped deliver the Prime Minister’s baby daughter is at the centre of a major probe into the care and treatment he provided to more than 1,500 women, it has emerged.

An investigation was launched into Royal Cornwall Hospital consultant obstetrician Kenneth Jones, known as Rob, following concerns raised by staff.

As a result, 1,574 gynaecological patients treated by the consultant over the last two-and-a-half years have been contacted by the hospital.

A Downing Street spokesman said Samantha Cameron was not one of the women who had been contacted by the trust.

'We are aware of the situation. I can confirm she is not part of the inquiries that the trust is making,' he said.

Lezli Boswell, chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust (RCHT), said: 'As a result of concerns raised by our staff about Mr Jones, we ordered an immediate internal investigation and at the same time limited his clinical practice.

'RCHT then asked the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to carry out an independent review of Mr Jones’ clinical practice. That review has been done and the trust has implemented all of its recommendations.

'In addition, the trust is reviewing the care and treatment offered to specific women seen by Mr Jones. I know that while we are undertaking this review of some of Mr Jones’ patients, other women may have concerns or questions about the care and treatment they too received from Mr Jones.

'I am deeply sorry for any anxiety, pain or distress caused to our patients. I also want to acknowledge and thank all those staff and patients who spoke out about Mr Jones.

'The trust is committed to finding out the full extent of the problems caused by this individual consultant’s clinical practice and will take all steps necessary to ensure we do the best by our patients who have received poor treatment or care.

Mrs Boswell said Mr Jones was no longer employed by the trust and had not worked at the hospital since May 2012.

Any patient or relative who has concerns was asked to call a special information line on 0800 180 4514 (open from 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday).
