'A loving mentor': Philomene Tiernan was on the MH17 flight when it was shot out of the sky by suspected terrorists

Sister Philomene Tiernan spent her life inspiring the young girls she oversaw at a girls' high school in Sydney.

As news of the tragic MH17 flight broke, it soon became clear the dedicated Catholic nun was among the 28 Australians on board who lost their lives when the plane was shot out of the sky over Ukraine.

Here her former student, Daily Mail Australia reporter LUCY THACKRAY, gives a first-hand account of what made her favourite mentor so special.....

'Sister Philomene Tiernan was one of those all-too-rare people that made everyone she met feel special.

We knew her as Sister Phil and she was the kindest person I'm sure I will ever come across.

She was the loving Nanna of Kincoppal-Rose Bay school in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, who seemed to possess an inbuilt radar for any homesick girl who had just arrived at the boarding school.

Sister Phil had that special ability to make us all feel at home.

This is undoubtedly the hardest thing I've ever had to write, and I think that’s because I just don’t feel my words can do justice to what an amazing woman she really was.

Sister Phil was cherished by so many people.

Today, I am in complete shock and at a loss for a woman that had such a huge impact on thousands of girls who passed through the big school gates.

Sister Phil never stopped working. She had once been a Director of Boarding and boarding mistress, responsible for caring for the boarders who came to the school from around the world.

Dedicated: Philomene Tiernan, pictured centre with former colleagues, was a boarding mistress and responsible for caring for those who boarded at the school

But the truth is she never really left the boarding school.

She would walk through the dormitories making sure every one of the 150 girls was fine.

Today, the outpouring of grief from the school’s extensive community is not just from the recent kids, but from their mothers and no doubt grandmothers as well.

'Her warm smile never left her face': 'Sister Phil', pictured with the headmistress of the school Hilary Johnston-Croke, was a caring and nurturing guide

She had an unwavering ability to know where everyone lived, how many siblings they had, and even the name of their favourite biscuit.

How she stored all that information about those hundreds of girls is honestly a mystery.

Her last role was in religious guidance, giving prayer sessions for the girls, and offering spiritual comfort to those in need.

She made every single one of them feel special. 

Sister Phil was such a crucial part of the school for so many years and it's impossible to think of the community without her.

In 2011, two years after I graduated, I went back to the school as a tutor. Sister Phil saw me in the library and gasped as if one of her own daughters had just come home.

It was the same every time I saw her - the same excitement and joy that I know she shared with everyone. She would envelop you in a big hug whenever she saw you and would kindly pat your wrist as you babbled on to her about your latest news.

'Well, isn't that wonderful!' she'd say earnestly. 'Oh darling, I am so proud, aren't you doing well!'

It didn't matter if she had somewhere to be. She would sit and listen and every time you felt truly enriched by that experience.

She had a warm smile that never left her face and a wonderful sense of humour that comes only from a genuine love of life.

Final goodbye: Lucy Thackray, pictured far left in 2009 when she graduated from Kincoppal Rose Bay, has paid an emotional tribute to her former mentor

She connected with everyone she came across. Generations of Kincoppal alumni are hurting now that someone who only gave love to the world could be taken like this.

It's days like this when you really realise that karma doesn't exist. If it did, why would tragedy ever choose Sister Phil?

Philomene Tiernan was on her way back to Australia from France when her plane crashed, killing everyone on board

Her entire existence was to bring good into this world.

But she gave unwavering guidance and taught people that faith in God, in themselves, and in the world would carry you through the journey.

All morning I'd been thinking how tragic the MH17 crash was, but it wasn't until I heard Sister Phil's name called out in the newsroom that it all became real.

This hideous crash that I'd been hearing about all morning wasn't halfway across the world, it was suddenly brought home.

A Sister of the Society of the Sacred Heart, Sister Phil was on her way home from Joigny in Burgundy, France, where the society was founded.

While in Paris, I am told she saw Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat in her resting place at St Francis Xavier Church, which was a special moment for her.

I hope that this experience had brought her joy.

Sister Phil has lived a meaningful, beautiful life and leaves such a huge mark on the world.

I hope that everyone touched by her, particularly those from Kincoppal-Rose Bay, finds strength in the messages and guidance that Sister Phil gave us all.

Thank you, Sister Phil. Rest in Peace.'
