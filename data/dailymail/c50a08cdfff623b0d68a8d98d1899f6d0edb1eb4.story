Feyenoord fans again clashed with riot police in Rome  ahead of their Europa League tie with Roma.

After 33 arrests in the Italian capital on Wednesday, fans fought running battles with police close to the  Spanish Steps in central Rome with some of Feyenoord's 6,000 travelling supporters injured as smoke bombs and bottles were thrown at officers.

Rome is notorious for its footballing violence, and has been the scene of bloodshed for Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and England fans in recent years.

The Mayor of Rome, Ignazio Marino, tweeted that the city had been 'devastated and hurt' by the violent scenes at one of the city's most picturesque locations.

He added: 'I am seriously angry. What is happening is unacceptable. We are in contact with the authorities and the Dutch Ambassador. It will not end here. I protested and demanded an explanation from those who are responsible for public order in this city.

'We found damage to the Barcaccia (fountain), which had just been restored. This violence is unacceptable and Romans will not be the ones who have to pay for it.'

Six police officers required medical attention, scooters in the area were damaged and the 17th-century 'Fountain of the Old Boat' which sits at the bottom of the Spanish Steps was damaged with a large chip. 

Nicola Zingaretti, president of the Lazio region of Rome tweeted: 'The scarring of Rome is the work of uncivilised. Now exemplary punishment is needed and no indulgence. Solidarity to the police.'

Supporters are steadily making their way towards the Stadio Olimpico with less than an hour until kick-off. The potential for more violence at the stadium is increased by the opposing traditional political beliefs of the two sets of supporters.

UEFA have said they will open an investigation into any clashes at, or within the vicinity of the stadium, with fans' behaviour away from the ground being outside of their remit. 

These latest shameful scenes come just two days after Chelsea supporters were filmed chanting 'we're racist, and that's the way we like it' while pushing a black man off a train in Paris, and fans were teargassed close to the Parc des Princes ahead of their game with Paris Saint-Germain.

The two teams played out a 1-1 draw, with Gervinho's first-half opener cancelled out by Colin Kazim-Richards' strike on 55 minutes.
