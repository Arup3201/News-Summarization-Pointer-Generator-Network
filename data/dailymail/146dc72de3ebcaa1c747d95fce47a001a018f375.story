When you look at your sleek, shiny phone it may look clean - excepting perhaps a few scuffs and smears from normal wear and tear.

But look below the surface and you will find an interior that is far more toxic than most people realise.

Researchers have undertaken a chemical analysis of 36 mobile handsets - including the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III - to find out which ones pose the most risk to the health of humans and our environment.

Researchers from healthystuff.org and ifixit analysed the chemicals inside leading phones, giving them a chemical ranking for how environmentally friendly they are.

The researchers analysed 30 different handsets for the research, including the bestselling Samsung Galaxy S3

Ubiquitous electronic gadgets harbour a
 staggering array of toxic chemicals, from hazardous flame retardants, 
PVC and bromine to heavy metals like lead, tin and chromium - and even 
mercury and cadmium.

However the hazardous ingredients of 
mobile phones have long been kept under wraps by manufacturers who are 
tight lipped about the recipes they use for their high-tech components.

The only way to find out then, is to 
take apart the gadgets and analyse their chemical components - which 
experts from ifixit.org and healthystuff.org have now done.

HeathyStuff.org sampled 36 different 
mobile phones that had been released in the last 5 years. The phones 
were completely disassembled and interior and exterior components were 
sampled by X-ray Fluorescence spectrometry - a process which determines 
the chemical composition of a material.

The team found that more modern phones are far more environmentally friendly - although the latest iPhone does have more harmful chemicals than its predecessor.

Agbogbloshie is a suburb of Accra, the capital of Ghana and the country's largest city. Above it rises a doomsday column of acrid black smoke - fuelled by burning plastic e-waste.

The area is poisonous, post-apocalyptic hell - a sprawling, toxic dumping ground stretching for a mile or two. This is the final resting place for your old TV, computer or mobile phone.

Piles of cracked computer monitors sit in rancid pools of noxious green slime, while the circuit boards and innards of old PCs leak toxic mercury, beryllium and cadmium, poisoning the earth.

Scampering over these mounds of decaying computers are red-eyed gangs of wild, young boys in rags who smash old computer components with rocks to rip out the valuable copper wire inside.

Here they burn the plastic away from computer monitors and plastic encased cables to get to the precious metals inside.

The combustion releases toxic metals - lead, beryllium, cadmium, mercury - into the atmosphere. Likewise, burning creates some of the most carcinogenic and toxic substances known, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans

This desperate situation here is part of a pattern all over the globe - First World nations dump their electronic rubbish on developing countries, poisoning communities, polluting water sources and causing birth defects, mental retardation and, ultimately, death.

The researchers then ranked the phones
 on a scale of 0-5 - with lowest being the best - according to three 
criteria: by chemical, by component and overall.

The Motorola Citrus ranked the least 
toxic phone followed by the iPhone 4 S and the LG Remarq. The new iPhone
 5 ranked 5th - better than its main competitor, Samsung's Galaxy S III,
 which ranked 9th.

The most toxic phone tested was the 
iPhone 2G, which was so poisonous it prompted a report by environmental 
group Greenpeace warning of the environmental dangers it posed.

Every phone sampled in the study 
contained at least one of following hazardous chemicals: lead, bromine, 
chlorine, mercury and cadmium.

These hazardous substances can pollute
 throughout a product’s life cycle, including when the minerals are 
extracted; when they are processed; during phone manufacturing; and at 
the end of the phone’s useful life.

Emissions during disposal and recycling of phones as electronic waste, or 'e-waste', are particularly problematic. A 2004 study found that three-quarters of all cell phones leach lead at levels that would qualify them as hazardous waste.

While tracking e-waste is difficult, 
it is estimated that 50-80 per cent is exported to countries such as 
China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines, where there is a 
labour-intensive, informal recycling infrastructure that often lacks 
environmental and human health safeguards.

Meanwhile, the mining of some tin, 
tantalum, tungsten and gold vital for use in the manufacture of mobile 
phones has been linked to bloody conflicts in the Democratic Republic of
 Congo.

Jeff Gearhart, research director at 
the Ecology Centre and founder of HealthyStuff.org, said: 'Even the best
 phones from our study are still loaded with chemical hazards.

'These chemicals, which are linked to 
birth defects, impaired learning and other serious health problems, have
 been found in soils at levels 10 to 100 times higher than background 
levels at e-waste recycling sites in China.

'We need better federal regulation of 
these chemicals, and we need to create incentives for the design of 
greener consumer electronics.'
