A training-ground injury to United’s Argentine defender Marcos Rojo prompted manager Louis van Gaal to bring Phil Jones back into the team for the first time since the October draw with West Bromwich Albion.

In doing so, Van Gaal flew in the face of one of his principles, that a player must train for two weeks before being considered for the first team.

Jones actually only returned to training on Thursday.

A REPRIEVE FOR KOLO

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers spoke recently about how much his team needed Kolo Toure, while just this week the Ivorian was given the club’s Player of the Month award. 

All very strange given that the ex-Arsenal and Manchester City defender was about to be sold to Turkish team Trabzonspor for £1.5m last summer. Ultimately, Toure rejected the move.

PRAWN SANDWICH NO GOOD, RONALD?

The differences between United manager Louis van Gaal and his former Ajax colleague Ronald Koeman are well known. 

However, somebody should have told the current Southampton manager that directors’ box guests at Old Trafford are entitled to a cup of tea and a sandwich at half-time. 

For some reason, the former Holland defender spent the whole of the break sitting on his own while everyone else went inside.

Former United boss David Moyes is trying to rebuild his reputation in Spain and got his first experience of the Basque derby on Sunday night.

His Real Sociedad side, playing their first game since a 4-0 defeat by Villarreal, earned a point with a 1-1 draw at home to Athletic Bilbao. 

Former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela put Sociedad in front with a header in the third minute but they were pegged back by Bilbao’s Oscar de Marcos.

Brendan Rodgers no doubt sent on Mario Balotelli at half-time with instructions to make an impact. His first three contributions were to fire a 30-yard pass out of play, push Marouane Fellaini in the face and then fall over holding his knee. Somehow, I doubt that was what Rodgers had in mind.
