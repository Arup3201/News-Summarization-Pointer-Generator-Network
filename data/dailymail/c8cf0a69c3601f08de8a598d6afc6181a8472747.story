Swansea expect to ratify the £6.5m signing of FC Twente striker Luc Castaignos over the summer despite a delay in negotiations.

The Swans saw an offer accepted for the 21-year-old more than a week ago, but personal terms are yet to be discussed.

However, Twente chairman Joop Munsterman has played down fears that the move could be in doubt.

The former Inter Milan striker is away in holiday, with the deal on hold until he returns.

'It will be a while before things can be done,” Munsterman told Voetbal International.

'The choice is up to the player. Only when Luc is back from vacation and is negotiating with Swansea can we expect progress. And as I have said, the clubs can work it out.'
