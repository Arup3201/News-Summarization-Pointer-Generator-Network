A teacher at one of Britain’s top public schools has been arrested on suspicion of raping a former pupil. 

Dr Dean Johnson, a physics master at Charterhouse in Surrey, has been forced to leave the £31,680-a-year boarding school following the alleged incident.

The divorced father-of-three,  who was educated at Oxford and Cambridge, was held by police on April 12.

The letter sent to parents of children at Charterhouse School informing them about a teacher who had an inappropriate relationship with a former pupil

He has taught at the prestigious school for 12 years and was well-liked among students and teachers.

The victim is understood to be a graduate in her 20s, who cannot be named for legal reasons. According to two former pupils who knew her, Dr Johnson and the girl had been involved in a secret relationship since her first year of sixth form – when she was 16.

 One of them, who didn’t wish to be identified, said: ‘She was quite quiet and was involved in societies he ran.’

Dr Johnson, 48, who specialises in astronomy and astrophysics, lived in a £500,000 house owned by the Godalming school. He also advertised his services as a private tutor outside of school hours.

The master – who was known to staff and pupils as ‘Deano’ – would regularly stay after school hours with pupils from his school-house until 10pm, helping them with homework and after-school activities.His alleged victim was one of the pupils he would supervise.

A letter from the headmaster of the school, Reverend John Witheridge, was sent to parents last weekend.

The teacher has since resigned from his post at the exclusive Charterhouse School in Godalming

It read: ‘I write to inform you that Dr Dean Johnson (Physics) has resigned after the school was made aware of serious concerns about the existence of an inappropriate relationship with a former sixth-form girl.

‘I am sure you will understand that I am unable to go into any further detail.’ It continues: ‘If you have concerns, do please let me know, and I will do my best to answer them if I can.’

A school spokesman said it would be ‘improper’ to give any further comment.

A police spokesman said: ‘A  48-year-old man is currently on conditional bail in relation to  an allegation of a serious  sexual offence at an address in Godalming. He is due to  report back to Guildford Police Station on July 16, 2013.’

Charterhouse, whose motto is ‘Because God has given I give’, counts  broadcaster David Dimbleby,  Genesis founder members Peter Gabriel and Mike Rutherford,  and Robert Baden-Powell among its alumni.

In March last year, the school was at the centre of a police inquiry after a boy was arrested on suspicion of filming naked pupils.

 The 16-year-old was said to have captured ‘indecent images’ in a video which was allegedly stored on his computer.

In 2010, Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker criticised the school for failing to get his son George a place at his chosen university.

Charterhouse was originally built over 68 acres where 120 boys were taught in three boarding houses.

Today it spreads over 200 acres, has 795 pupils and girls are allowed in the sixth form.
