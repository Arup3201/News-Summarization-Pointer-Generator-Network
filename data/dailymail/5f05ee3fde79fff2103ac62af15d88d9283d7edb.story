For the survivors of a shooting rampage 13 years ago, news of a gunman in the quiet village of Newtown, it was like reliving a nightmare.

News of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was all the more poignant for survivors of the 1999 shooting at the North Valley Jewish Community Center, who knew what terrors these children must have gone through.

Survivor Ben Kadish, now 19, was only six years old when white supremacist Buford Furrow, Jr. walked into the community center and shot 70 bullets into the lobby. The barrage hit him in his leg and his abdomen.

The JCC survivors were shocked when they
 heard reports coming out of Newtown, Connecticut, in part because they 
had heart it before.

Furrow wounded five people, including
 Stepakoff and Kadish, as well as a teenager and a senior citizen before
 killing a Filipino-American postal worker.

Mr
 Kadish told KABC in Los Angeles that he has several strong memories of 
the day. He was at the community center attending summer camp with 
friends.

After the shooting, he said that he remembered paramedics coming up to him, ‘(then) I remember just waking up in the hospital.’

‘I was just appalled to find out that it was the exact same thing that happened to me,’ Joshua Stepakoff, 19, told the Los Angeles Daily News.

‘The pictures of the children being reunited with their families, all the parents waiting to hear about their children – all those images were identical to what I saw in 1999.’

Both of the teenagers offered advice to those dealing with the raw grief and anger following the Sandy Hook shootings.

‘You need to talk out your emotions, and it’s okay to show your emotions and the true feelings that you have, instead of holding it in and keeping it from everyone,’ said Mr Kadish, who spent months recovering from his wounds.

Since the shooting, both Mr Kadish and Mr Stepakoff have become adamant advocates for gun control. Mr Stepakoff said that gun control must not only be talked about, but acted upon. 

He also gave his own personal advice to the surviving children of the Sandy Hook shooting, who will forever remember the horrific day of December 14, 2012.

‘I had nightmares for a while,’ he told the Daily News, adding that his fear kept him from doing activities any child would not normally find frightening – including sleep-overs and going about day to day life.

‘It never fully goes away,’ Mr Steakoff said, 'but I'm not that bad anymore and I'm thankful for that.'

Furrow, according to a 1999 report by the New York Times, was an ‘avid’ racist who said a year before the shooting that he dreamed of committing murder on a mass scale. 

At the time, the high-profile case sparked conversations on mental health in America. Experts said that the shooter did not slip through the cracks.

In his case, the debate was whether it was legal and ethical to hold someone such as him in prison for being a violent and racist person.

Furrow had gone to a mental hospital on October 28 to have himself committed, threatening to stab two women there. 

He also told police officers that he harbored fantasies of shooting random people at a mall. Still, he was allowed to go free.

In 2001, he pleaded guilty to 16 felony counts, including the murder of the postal worker, and is serving a life prison sentence.

Over the past two days, heartbroken residents of Newtown have been burying their dead who were killed on the December 14 shooting. 

As more victims from the slaughter of 20 children and six adults were laid to rest, long funeral processions clogged the streets of Newtown, where Christmas trees were turned into memorials and a season that should be a time of joy was marked by heart-wrenching loss.

At least nine funerals and wakes were held Wednesday for those who died when gunman Adam Lanza, armed with a military-style assault rifle, broke into the school Friday and opened fire on their classrooms.

Lanza killed his mother at her home before the attack and committed suicide at the school as police closed in.
