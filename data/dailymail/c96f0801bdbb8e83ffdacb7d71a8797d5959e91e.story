Grappling in the box is just like diving — it drives everybody mad. The important thing now is that if referees are going to clamp down on it, it has to be the same for everybody.

It has been funny to see Chelsea almost position themselves as victims. Yes, John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic were put in a couple of headlocks at Old Trafford. But are those two innocent of grabbing people in the area? Do me a favour.

Every team in the league does it because they know they can get away with it. It’s the same with any part of the game — diving to win a free-kick, illegally stopping an opponent — if you don’t get punished, you’ll keep doing it.

But I’ve always said if a player dives one week and is banned for three games, there’s no way he’ll do it next time. It’s the same with grappling. If penalties are given and cards are shown, it will start to disappear.

I have sympathy for the referees because there is so much pushing and shoving going on — they can’t keep their eyes on everyone. It works both ways, too, with strikers fouling defenders just as much as the other way around. 

In my playing days I covered the space at the near post for a corner, but if I felt I could stop an opponent with a grapple I would, because I knew the referee wouldn’t punish me.

My Sportsmail colleague Martin Keown, who helped launch this campaign, was a great defender but I seem to remember even he grabbed me around the neck a few times!

If I was a manager that’s how I would want my players to defend. Not because it’s right, but because teams have got away with it for years. It’s time something was done.

There’s no doubt Ryan Shawcross is a serial offender. 

But he’s not alone. Shawcross is one of a group who stand watching the man rather than the ball — it’s not proper defending and it has to stop.

Referees are going to be under scrutiny now at every free-kick or corner. I just hope they are strong enough and consistent enough to start acting.
