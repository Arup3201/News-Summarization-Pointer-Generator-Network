She has so far kept mum on reports she is pregnant with her first child.

But Jersey Shore star Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi added fuel to the rumours today when she stepped out sporting what appeared to be an engagement ring.

The reality star showed off the diamond as she took her dog for a walk in Jersey City along with her co-star Jennifer 'JWoww' Farley.

A telling accessory: The ring suggests Snooki is engaged to boyfriend Jionni LaVille

The rock suggests that the 24-year-old has become engaged to her boyfriend Jionni LaVille.

She seemed quite happy to flash the bling as she held a neon yellow and black and white patterned bag up on one arm and held her dog's leash on the other.

Perhaps appropriately, she sported a black T-shirt emblazoned with a gold sequinned heart.

She looked calm, despite  the news that her ex-boyfriend Emilio Masella made a shocking statement that he hopes she has a miscarriage.

Masella, who split from Jersey Shore star Snooki in April 2010, made the horrifying admission to TMZ.com.

He told the website: 'I hope for her sake ... not to be rude or anything ... but I hope she has a miscarriage.'

Masella
 also said that he thinks it would be a good idea for Snooki's boyfriend
 Jionni LaValle to get a paternity test to confirm that he is in fact 
the father of the baby.

He said: 'I would def recommend her to get 
pregnancy test to see who the father is because I’m sure there are other
 subjects.'

Masella then added: 'Vinny could easily be the father.'

However he may find himself in hot water after it was reported that he received a legal warning from Snooki's lawyers last month.

TMZ has reported that after Masella 
insinuated he could be the father of Snooki's baby, her lawyers issued a
 cease and desist letter, threatening to sue if he continued with the 
accusations.

The document, 
issued on February 1, apparently said: 'Demand is hereby made that you 
cease and desist from making any additional public statements regarding 
Ms. Polizzi that could in any way be taken to be offensive by her.'

However, fans of Jersey Shore will know 
Snooki and Vinny have always had a close relationship, and ended up 
sleeping together on several occasions in the last series of the show.

In last week's episode of the current series of the MTV show, Vinny was even seen telling viewers that he and Snooki are like the 'Ross and Rachel of Jersey Shore' after they enjoyed a flirty afternoon together.

While Snooki has yet to confirm whether or not she is pregnant, it is thought that she is around three months along with her first child.

However, Masella added to TMZ.com that Snooki had always been flippant about the prospect of having a family.

Who's the daddy? Emilio also suggested that Snooki's Jersey Shore castmate Vinny might be the father of her baby, after their various hook-ups on the show

He said: 'When I was with her, she said she wanted twins. She would always say "Let’s have twins."'

Masella predicted that Snooki and Jionni will marry after the baby's birth, but that reality star Snooki would 'pull a Kim Kardashian' by 'having the baby and break up with him right after.'

Meanwhile, there was better news for jWoww today, when she took delivery of a brand new BMW SUV car at their home in Jersey City.
