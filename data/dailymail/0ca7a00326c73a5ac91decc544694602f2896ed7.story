Price-war: Asda said its petrol would be going down to 120.7p a litre, with its diesel dipping to 124.7p a litre

Asda said its petrol would be going down to 120.7p a litre, with its diesel dipping to 124.7p a litre - its lowest prices since December 2010.

Peter Cattell, fuel director for Tesco said: 'We'll be cutting the price of petrol and diesel by up to 2 pence per litre. As Britain's biggest fuel retailer, this means more motorists can make real savings.'

Mark Todd, petrol director for Morrisons, said: 'Recent wholesale price drops have allowed us to pass these savings on to the customer.'

AA head of roads policy Paul Watters said: 'These latest price moves are a timely boost for UK families as they see fuel consumption go up with the start of winter driving and the heating being switched on at home.'

He added: 'Asda's latest price-drop follows a 5p-a-litre fall in wholesale petrol costs over the past fortnight.

'Average UK petrol prices last week were already mirroring a previous 5.5p-a-litre wholesale reduction since June. This cut the typical pump price from a summer high of around 131.5p a litre to below 126.0p last week.'

'Timely': The AA welcomed the price moves, saying that families will see fuel consumption go up with the start of winter driving and the heating being switched on at home. Above, file image

'The big question is whether Sainsbury's, after its dramatic cut at the end of last month, follows suit. If so, this should help to drag down prices at other supermarkets and nearby retailers.'

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'This is not an unexpected cut as there is plenty of margin between wholesale and retail costs for prices to go lower still. 

'Oil continues to be pumped way above global demand which, combined with a strong pound, is good news for motorists.'
