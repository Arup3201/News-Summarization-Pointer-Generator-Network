On the eve of her release from jail, lying mother Karen Matthews says ‘several others’ were involved in the abduction of her child four years ago, it was claimed today.

Matthews, who pretended daughter Shannon, nine, was missing for a month but drugged and hid her under a bed, alleges she would be murdered if she revealed who was behind the plot in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire.

Speaking from Foston Hall Prison in Derbyshire, the 36-year-old says she is too frightened to say who actually did it, claiming ‘they should be here, not me’.

In a bizarre rant the mother of seven allegedly confided in a friend that all she wants when she gets out is a lie detector test to prove her claims followed by a Big Mac burger from McDonalds.

Matthews is due for release before Easter under a new name, after serving half her eight-year jail sentence for kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.

Her accomplice Michael Donovan, 44, the uncle of her then boyfriend, is believed to have been released this month after serving half of the same sentence.

Friend and former neighbour Julie Bushby has visited Matthews throughout her time in jail - despite being conned by Matthews, like many others, into searching for her child at the time - and has revealed her views in the Daily Mirror.

Sham: Karen Matthews caused as national frenzy after Shannon disappeared, but in fact had hidden her under a bed with the help of Michael Donovan

‘I won’t come clean about what I actually know about what happened because I’ve been threatened,’ Matthews told Ms Bushby.

‘When I get out I want a lie detector test to show I’m innocent – and a Big Mac.

‘There are others who should be here instead of me but I was too scared to open my mouth. They said they would kill me if I did. They should be here, not me.’

She added after that she will go to live by the ‘ocean’ under her new identity.

Matthews became a hate figure over the plot to abduct Shannon to claim a £50,000 reward.

Shown in tears on television, she said Shannon was gone but knew exactly where she was stashed.

She has already undergone a ‘full makeover’ complete with a trendy new hairstyle and is hoping she will not be recognised by the public when she is back in the community.

As a prisoner released on licence, Matthews is likely to begin her new life at a probation hostel.

She and Donovan caused a £3.2million police hunt when they kidnapped Shannon from her home in February 2008.

Matthews appeared before the media pretending to be distraught at her daughter’s disappearance and hundreds of local people helped in the search.

But Shannon was found by police 24 days later in Donovan’s flat a mile away, hidden in a compartment under a divan.

While in jail Matthews has been badly beaten by other inmates and was fired from her cleaner’s job for snooping at confidential files.

To avoid trouble from prisoners, which include Baby P’s mother and Vanessa George, the nursery paedophile, she spends her time watching daytime TV, doing art and singing to herself in her en suite cell.

Ms Bushby, a former residents association chairman, told the Mirror that she still does not believe Sharon is telling the truth but that the original plot was not about the reward money.

But since then she has been banned from going to visit by the West Yorkshire Probation service.

‘You have been a great source of comfort to Karen during these difficult years and I know that she has really appreciated it, and considers you her only real friend,’ the letter says.

‘However, you, above all people will appreciate the need to ensure we do our level best to keep Karen... safe, upon her release.

‘Karen will be expected to abide by a number of very strict conditions on her release. Not because we are punishing her, but because of the public who consider her a legitimate target for their own anger.

‘Any restrictions placed on Karen have come about after long-term planning and approval from the highest sources within the Home Office.’
