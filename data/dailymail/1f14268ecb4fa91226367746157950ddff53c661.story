A racing fan shot himself dead at an NRA-sponsored NASCAR race in Texas last night, it was revealed today.

Kirk Franklin, 42, of Saginaw, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a heated argument in the infield of Texas Motor Speedway, police said.

The man and his friends have been watching the NRA500 NASCAR race about 10.30pm when he shot himself.

Police spokeswoman Cpl. Tracey Knight has said alcohol may have been a factor.

Track spokesman Mike Zizzo say the death occurred 'in or around a pickup truck' in part of the infield near the middle of the backstretch.

Knight said she wasn't sure of Franklin's relationship with others involved in the argument.

Several people witnessed the incident, but nobody was in danger, she said.

The police official did not elaborate further on the cause of death but said there were no suspects. Emergency vehicles were called to the scene.

Police blocked off the area around the incident, and investigators could be seen looking into a truck.

Franklin died towards the end of the NRA 500, which kicked off at the Fort Worth speedway at 7:30 p.m.

Kyle Busch led the final 19 laps to win the race event.
