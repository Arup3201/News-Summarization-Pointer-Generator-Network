Women looking to cheat on their partners consider a sense of humour as more of a turn-on than oral sex, a survey reveals.

Victoria Milan, a dating website for attached people looking to cheat, analysed the dating profiles of 616,080 of its cheating female members from all over the globe and found that the majority are more attracted to someone who makes them laugh than the physical chemistry.

While Aussie women prefer a good laugh, intelligence and confidence over foreplay - even if it is only a one-night stand - Brazilian women rank oral sex as as the most essential skill for a man to acquire.

A sense of humour came out on top as the biggest turn-on in for more than half of the Aussie women surveyed

The study revealed cheating women from 15 of 21 countries, including Australia, find humour as more alluring than having brains or being skilled in the bedroom.

Almost half of the Aussie women in the survey saw possessing a wit as an absolute winner (44.37%) with self-confidence (39.61%) and intelligence (38.21%) deemed the next most important.

It's no surprise that the down-to-earth characteristic made it into the top 5 with Aussies known for this trait when living in the land Down Under.

The playful act of teasing made it in at number five above any sexual acts with the Aussie ladies.

Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, a happily married man who started the site in 2010, said that the results show the majority of women look for qualities outside of the physical – even if it's just a casual fling. 

'Good looks will fade, and sex drive may diminish – but seeing the light side of life is a quality that never gets old,' Mr Vedal said.

'A great sense of humour is a must for the majority of cheating women – even if it's just for a fun fling,'

Although the study shows that most women across the globe prefer a funny man, there's always an exception to the rule with Brazilian women voted for oral sex as being the most important skill among man.

German and Polish women rank intelligence over hilarity, while Peruvian and Mexican women want their men playful and experimental.

Countries included in the study include Australia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, France, Portugal, New Zealand, Argentina, Spain, Netherlands, Ireland, Greece, Belgium, Austria, United Kingdom, Italy and Czech Republic.
