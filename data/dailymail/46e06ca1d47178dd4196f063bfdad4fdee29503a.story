My morning walk along the Thames on Sunday took me past a moored boat with the owner reading his paper. ‘We will be right for the 2019 World Cup,’ he shouted up. His wry comment sums up the type of thinking that has permeated England’s fans, players and coaching staff. It shouldn’t be like this.

Let’s hear no talk about 2019 in the next 10 months from anyone within the England camp. This team have lost five matches in a row and need to get back to winning ways, starting with Samoa on Saturday.

A large chunk of this squad will not even make it through to 2019 and this endless talk of development, learning, number of caps and the future is disrespectful to them. It is also disrespectful to the fans who pay a lot of money to go to Twickenham. They want to see results, not a development exercise.

Their one chance at World Cup glory is 2015, that is their Holy Grail and it should be everyone’s. The way you get there is by making every match from now a knockout game. England can absolutely win the 2015 World Cup, I know they can based on the talent they have available, but they have got to start being deadly serious and ruthless, and it starts with Samoa and not Australia.

Some will say that four of the five defeats were to New Zealand but if anyone at Twickenham thinks like that, they are in the wrong place.

I agree with Stuart Lancaster that now is not the time to panic but I totally disagree with suggestions that England might use the Samoa game to experiment and to give starts to some of the reserves and bench players in the squad. We do not have that luxury any more.

Doing that encourages totally the wrong mindset. What England need to do is approach Saturday’s game like any other Test and pick their strongest team. They need to unequivocally decide what that XV is and produce a superlative performance against Samoa to instil confidence and momentum. This will give the team the maximum chance of facing Australia with the right mindset and finishing the autumn internationals on a high.

South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England 

That first-choice XV will definitely involve changes because the team defeated by South Africa was not right, especially behind the scrum. But if now is not the time for wholesale changes, it is crunch time.

I would love to see Lancaster make a really bold decision to set the scene and get some excitement in the team, do something to show that England mean business and that the last two performances are not acceptable.

Lancaster needs to make it clear that he is picking his best team because it then spells out to players who are not included that they have been dropped, not rested. This is not the time for niceties, it’s time players are told that they are not performing at their best and somebody else is now rated above them.

No player can think his is an automatic selection. I only ever told Martin Johnson or Lawrence Dallaglio they were my captain for one game at a time because they had to earn their place. I had a decent contract with the RFU but I knew I could be sacked if I had three or four bad results.

England's dominance in the first quarter against New Zealand still saw them come up short

A spell of pressure for New Zealand saw Richie McCaw gather the ball and score for the All Blacks

The moment players think they are part of a long-term strategy, they consider themselves young players who don’t have to win every game. That attitude seeps into you and it is wrong. They should instead remember the old adage: you’re only as good as your last game.

I dropped Dallaglio for what would have been his 50th cap. We had beaten New Zealand but I left him out of the next match against Australia because I thought Lewis Moody was a better option. I had to do what was best for the team but he still talks about it now!

With regards to this team, the half-backs need to change, with Danny Care and Owen Farrell replaced by Ben Youngs and George Ford. I would still pick Danny Cipriani but he is not even in the squad so clearly this will not happen. I would have liked to see Farrell at 12 but the chance has gone because he is out of form. So England must find a ball-player at 12.

England went in at half time with the lead but ultimately lost out to an impressive New Zealand team

Dylan Hartley's indiscipline cost England on Saturday and he could make way at hooker

I have no idea what England’s thinking at centre is at the moment, what their pecking order is, but if they decide to bring in Luther Burrell it must be spelled out to whoever makes way that he has been dropped.

Billy Vunipola will know he didn’t have the best game but we need some more pace in the back row to supplement the excellent work of the front five. James Haskell can bring that pace and would take to the field like a man possessed, knowing the jersey is up for grabs. Ben Morgan had a brilliant spell when he came on but can he play the full 80 minutes? If not, do not pick him.

I was disappointed by Dylan Hartley’s lack of discipline with his yellow card on Saturday which marred some good line-out throwing this autumn. So if England decide to start with Rob Webber, it should be because they think he is the best man for the job, not because he needs a run-out. The same applies if Haskell comes into the back row.

England lost 24-21 against New Zealand at a rain-soaked Twickenham after an impressive second half from the All Blacks on Saturday

Lancaster has got to be completely blinkered now in his approach to every game. Watching Australia coach Michael Cheika ahead of the France match was fascinating. He was so animated, standing in the middle of his players. But his job, like any international coach is very simple: coach and select the team and let nothing and nobody distract you. Just win the next game. It is a very straightforward job description.

Instead, England seem to be complicating things. The visit of 400metres legend Michael Johnson to Pennyhill Park last week raised a few eyebrows. In a summer fitness camp or an early season, that’s OK and has value and there is no one better than Johnson, who is a brilliant individual.

But right in the middle of one of the most important weeks of the season before a must-win game against a team you haven’t beaten in the last 11 attempts? No way. I would prefer to think the England camp is an aggressive, hostile, uncompromising environment right now with some tough meetings being held.

George Ford should replace Owen Farrell at fly half because the latter is suffering for form

Farrell has struggled for form and should make way at fly half for the match against Samoa

When a squad is properly in the zone some pretty harsh words can be spoken in training in the week before these huge internationals and it can all kick off behind closed doors. That’s a good thing as all top teams need some sulphur in the air at times. It’s not very nice sometimes but that is what true high-performance environments are like.

It’s what happens when big characters are all straining at the leash trying to make something great happen for England. But that is never going to occur when you have celebrities or VIPs to contend with. Every meeting and every session must be held in private.

England are trying to tick boxes that don’t need ticking. There is a danger of trying to be friends with everybody. Too much attention is going into stuff that just doesn’t matter in terms of winning the match on Saturday. The only thing that matters is what happens on the pitch and that is how you will be judged. I’m hoping the disappointment of the last two games especially can galvanise this team into producing something special in the next two matches.

Then, when I walk past my friend reading his paper on the boat next week, he might say: ‘Wow, did you see England play yesterday? That was fantastic.’

James Haskell (centre) would add dynamism to England's play and he would get around the park well

Rob Webber has impressed and may come into the team at the expense of Hartley
