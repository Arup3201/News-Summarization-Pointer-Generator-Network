Emma Thompson, pictured during filming of the Graham Norton Show, has lamented the pressure on young actresses to be skinny

Double Oscar-winner Emma Thompson has lamented the pressure on young actresses to be skinny and claimed she would never have stood for it when she was starting out.

The 54-year-old, who will be the centre of attention at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts tonight, said managers, agents and handlers urge women in the industry to conform to a look.

She said: 'It seems young actresses are under pressure to look a particular way. They
look the same, that’s the thing. And they’re all being photoshopped in 
adverts for all sorts of (products), so maybe that’s difficult as well —
because you’ve got pictures of yourself looking perfect.

'They
have to be this specific model size, and if they get on to the red 
carpet, they’re all having to walk like models and dress like models. I 
think the pressure is terrible.

'I'd have told them where to
shove it. I’ve always been a card-carrying feminist. But in those days,
I was fierce, fierce, very angry. So I wouldn't have put up with a single bloody minute of that.'

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, the outspoken actress said she was 'glad to be working at all' following her 30-year screen career.

Thompson, who is married to her second husband, 47-year-old actor Greg Wise, recently caused controversy with her 'sex handbook' for her 14-year-old daughter Gaia.

In 2003 they also adopted Tindyebwa Agaba, then a 16-year-old Rwandan orphan, who now works as a human rights lawyer.

Thompson is the daughter of actress Phyllida Law and the late stage director Eric Thompson, who wrote  and narrated The Magic Roundabout for the BBC.

Her first marriage to Kenneth Branagh ended in 1995 after it emerged he had had an affair with Helena Bonham Carter.

Speaking
about the episode for the first time recently she said: ‘Helena and I 
made our peace years ago. You can’t hold on to something like that. I 
haven’t got the energy for it.’

Thompson's
latest role tells the story of the creative struggle between Mary 
Poppins author PL Travers and Walt Disney – played by Tom Hanks – over 
the 1965 film adaptation of the book starring Julie Andrews.

New role: Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers
