A baseball superfan has been banned from watching his beloved team because he cheers them on too enthusiastically.

Diehard UC Irvine Anteaters baseball fan Keith Franklin, 49, had his season ticket revoked in 
February after taking to the infield with a homemade banner 
commemorating career victory No. 1,000 for Anteaters coach Mike 
Gillespie.

A photo shows Franklin and Gillespie shaking hands, although two campus police officers ran onto the field and ordered Franklin to leave, witnesses said.

The school says he went over the line, because had had violated a common ballpark rule prohibiting fans on the field, although Franklin says he had permission.

Two weeks later, Franklin returned to Cicerone Field for an Irvine home game.

When he reached the stadium, an attendant held him up as three campus police officers and two security personnel came running to greet him, Franklin said reported Cal Coast News.

Two weeks later, Franklin returned to Cicerone Field for an Irvine home game. When he reached the stadium he was denied entry

The school denied Franklin, a season ticket holder, entrance to the ballpark.

'It was like a knife in my heart,' Franklin said.

'They took away what I love most.'

He has not entered the stadium since - his season ticket, a gift from a former UCI pitcher, has been revoked.

Since the home-field banishment, Franklin's enthusiasm hasn't waned. He attends all away games, leading cheers and inventing nicknames for players

Superfan Franklin is maintaining his vow not to cut his hair until the Anteaters make the College World Series

UC Irvine Athletics issued a statement to the OC Register on Wednesday 'regarding Mr. Franklin.' Here’s an excerpt:

'UC
 Irvine Athletics appreciates the fan support we receive for our sports 
at all of our venues. We are not in the business of keeping fans away 
from our home events.

'Mr. Franklin has been an avid supporter of our baseball program for nearly 10 years and we have appreciated his enthusiasm.

'However,
 he has been stretching the rules of our stadium fan-conduct policy for 
several years and he crossed the line earlier this season, in late 
February, with threatening, aggressive behavior and language directed at
 our staff as well as law enforcement officers. This behavior is neither
 condoned nor tolerated on our university campus.'

Since the home-field banishment, Franklin's enthusiasm hasn't waned.

He attends all away games, leading cheers and inventing nicknames for players.

And he's maintaining his vow not to cut his hair until the Anteaters make the College World Series.
