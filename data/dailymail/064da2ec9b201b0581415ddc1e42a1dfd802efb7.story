Nicolas Sarkozy is preparing to defy his wife's wishes and run for president of France again in four years time, a close ally revealed today.

Former supermodel Carla Bruni has spoken openly about not wanting her husband to return to politics.

She told newspaper this week: 'I have no wish for Nicolas to get involved in all that again. We're very happy with our lives.'

But Sarkozy's former foreign minister and close friend Alain Juppe has now revealed the defeated president will campaign for the leadership again in 2017.

He told France's Parliamentary TV channel LCP: 'I get the feeling that he will - even if it's not for me to answer that question in his place.

'Nicolas Sarkozy is here in France, he follows politics with a great deal of attention and from our regular phone calls I can tell he is extremely vigilant.'

Sarkozy was heavily beaten in the race for the presidency by socialist Francois Hollande last May.

In October last year, his former agriculture minister Bruno Le Maire also said Sarkozy would run for office again because the socialists were 'ruining France'.

Mr Le Maire said Sarkozy told him: 
'Looking at the disastrous state France risks finding itself in in five 
years time, I will have no choice in 2017.

'The
question is not knowing whether I'm going to make a come-back, but if 
morally I have the choice regarding France to not come back.

'Morally, I can not let the French people down.'

Sarkozy said before last May's election that if he lost 'no one would ever hear from him again'.

But since then he has earned hundreds of 
thousands of pounds on the international lecture circuit while wife 
Carla has resumed her career as a pop star.

Sarkozy is also now facing corruption charges over illegal campaign funding.

He is accused of accepting illegal 
party funding payments from France's richest woman and L'Oreal heiress 
Lilian Bettencourt in return for tax breaks.

He has dismissed the allegations as 'rubbish'.
