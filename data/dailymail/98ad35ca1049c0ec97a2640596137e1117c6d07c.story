On Wednesday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, she bravely waded through vats of blood and guts, telling squeamish contestant Laura Dundovic 'I think you could have done it if you had given childbirth'.

But giving birth is unlikely to be the most difficult thing Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia on iconic seventies show The Brady Bunch, has ever been through. 

The now 58-year-old revealed her dark past, including an addiction to cocaine, trading sex for drugs, eating disorders, abortions and learning her grandmother died of syphilis, in a 2008 tell-all memoir, Here's the Story: Surviving Marcia Brady and Finding My True Voice.

Taking the plunge: Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia on The Brady Bunch, bravely waded into a pool of blood and guts on Wednesday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here

In the book, the one-time golden girl of American television admitted that behind-the-scenes of the hit show she was nothing like her clean-cut character Marcia Brady, and she spiraled into cocaine addiction from the age of about 18. 

'I sought refuge in seemingly glamorous cocaine dens above Hollywood. I thought I would find answers there, while in reality I was simply running farther from myself. From there, I spiraled downward on a path of self-destruction that cost me my career and very nearly my life,' she wrote.

What Maureen was 'running' from was a disturbing secret in her family's past, discovering her grandmother had died of syphilis in a mental institution and that her own mother contracted the disease in utero.

Marcia, Marcia, Marcia! The now 58-year-old was once the golden girl of American television, although she revealed in her 2008 autobiography that it was a very different story behind-the-scenes

Cocaine hell: The promising young actress fell into Hollywood's drug scene, and says she was hooked on cocaine for at least five years from the age of 18 - her final year filming The Brady Bunch

Co-star: With her Brady Bunch 'brother' Barry Williams, who Maureen revealed she dated at one time when the show was being filmed

Despite her mother being treated for the condition to prevent passing it on to her own children, the information troubled the young actress and only added to the anxiety and depression she was experiencing as a teenager growing up on screen. 

Even with her long blonde hair and slim physique, Maureen felt the pressure of Hollywood take a toll on her body image, and she soon developed bulimia in an effort to attain what she saw as perfection. 

Falling deeper into the Hollywood drug scene, the young actress' addiction became so bad she admits she had sex with a cocaine dealer in exchange for drugs.

More troubles: The starlet also struggled with depression and bulimia, the pressures of Hollywood and living up to the 'perfect' character she portrayed taking its toll

'If there was coke, I had to stay up and do every last flake even if it meant going without sleep for days,' she wrote. 'Nothing else mattered'. 

The promising young starlet's career was squandered by her addiction, and she reveals how she threw away acting opportunities by turning up to meetings with Hollywood producers high on drugs and having not slept for days. 

She recalls how Steven Spielberg simply gave her an orange when she went to meet him to discuss a part in Raiders Of The Lost Ark despite being completely 'messed up'.

Transformation: The American star has put her dark past behind her and now lives with husband Michael Cummings and daughter Natalie, 25, in Los Angeles

Her out of control behaviour also led to several unwanted pregnancies. 

'I was 18, 19 and 20 when I had each abortion,' she recalled. 'It shows how careless I was. It shows what drugs did to me and how far I went.' 

Yet another secret revealed in the tell-all was that she enjoyed a brief romance with her on-screen brother, Barry Williams.

Long-time love: Maureen married Michael Cummings in 1985 and she credits him with helping her turn her life around

Family: Maureen with her daughter Natalie, 25, and older brother Denny

Mother and daughter: Maureen with a young Natalie in 1998

She confessed the pair's fling began with a passionate kiss when they filmed scenes in Hawaii. 

Maureen eventually went to rehab and credits meeting husband Michael Cummings, who she married in 1985, with turning her life around.

The couple have one daughter Natalie, 25.  

In the past: Maureen, pictured in Hollywood in 2013, turned her life around and has been clean for decades
