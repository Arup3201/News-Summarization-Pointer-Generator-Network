As a 30-year veteran of BBC news, you would have thought Michael Buerk had seen everything. But perhaps nothing quite like this ...

Yesterday the unflappable broadcaster seemed mesmerised by the enthusiastic twerking of Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson as he started his unlikely stint on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.

Wilkinson, 29, was trying to teach Buerk some moves after enjoying a cocktail in the Australian hotel where the celebrities stayed before they headed to the jungle.

BBC broadcaster, 68, starts off his unlikely stint on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in Australia and seems mesmerised as he watches Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson, 29, show him some of her moves 

She said: ‘We should do some shots and get this party going. Let’s twerk or something – pick up your pants Michael to loosen them.’

After witnessing the demonstration, Buerk says: ‘Oh right, it’s a bit similar to belly dancing.’

Kendra replies: ‘Yes but with your a***!’

The journalist had raised eyebrows by agreeing to go on the ITV reality show, but said: ‘There’s a tendency to think very highly of one’s self and get terribly stuck up on these things, so all of my family has agreed it’s time I loosen up a bit.’

‘This is an ideal opportunity to do that, I suppose. It’s not my normal cup of tea, but who knows? I might be converted to it. It’s definitely a new world. But come on, it’s like being an explorer, isn’t it?’

It was in that adventurous spirit he also tried something no 68-year-old white Radio 4 presenter probably should – a hip-hop style handshake.

Tinchy Stryder, the 28-year-old Ghanaian-born rapper, showed the broadcaster how to pull off the complex greeting.

The hotel offered the last taste of luxury before the celebrities headed into the New South Wales rainforest for the start of the series tonight.

Already one of the participants has found it to be an emotional experience. The normally bubbly Gemma Collins from The Only Way Is Essex was so unnerved by the helicopter flight to base camp that she burst into tears, causing her carefully applied make-up to stream down her face.

Collins, 33, looked terrified even before she stepped aboard and spent the rest of the flight with her hands over her eyes.

At one point, she pleaded with he pilot: ‘Can you stop a minute please. I’m serious, just stop. I need to get out, seriously I’m going to be sick, I can’t do it, no way.’

Her emotions wrecked her plan to make a glamorous arrival in the jungle. Just hours before take-off she told journalists: ‘I’ve already booked a blow-dry before I go into the jungle. I’ve had my nails done and I’m off for a spray tan this evening. 

'I’ve had a full set of Russian eyelashes put in before I go in there.’

Also taking part in the series are Coronation Street star Craig Charles, Allo Allo actress Vicki Michelle and TV presenter Melanie Sykes. 

Former Minister Edwina Currie is also expected to enter the competition at a later date.

Mr Buerk, the presenter of Radio 4’s The Moral Maze, admitted he had probably made a mistake by not embarking on a fitness routine before his arrival. 

He said: ‘I have been in denial. I didn’t prepare at all, which was probably a dreadful mistake.’

He flew down under as the pop stars who were inspired to record the original Band Aid charity single by his news reports from Ethiopia in 1984 reunited in London.

They were joined by a new generation of pop stars to record a new version of Do They Know It’s Christmas? to raise money to combat Ebola.
