Chelsea rocketing to the top of the Premier League does not concern the star man of their main challengers.

David Silva believes his Manchester City side have a chance to reclaim their crown due to the Premier League's unpredictability.

The Londoners are currently sitting pretty five points clear of City in second, but Silva still doesn't think his rivals will have an easy ride the whole season.

'Chelsea have made great transfers, they have a great team, a great squad,' said Silva.

'But it doesn't mean things are going to be easy, especially in England.'

Silva linked up with Chelsea's talisman Diego Costa in Spain's 4-0 demolition of Luxembourg on Sunday, with both getting on the scoresheet.

It was Costa's first goal for Vincente del Bosque's side after an indifferent start to his Spain career.

'He wanted to score but he was unlucky. He has scored today and we hope that he can keep the goals coming,' Silva said.Â
