Samoa will go into their Four Nations debut against England under a cloud after three players were not considered for selection following a nightclub incident in Brisbane over the weekend.

Reni Maitua, Tautau Moga and Sauaso Sue were omitted by coach Matt Parish after it was revealed they are the subject of an NRL Integrity Unit review.

The Brisbane Courier Mail reported that Moga had been arrested following a nightclub brawl in the city's Fortitude Valley.
