Police shot and wounded an armed suspect who was hiding out in a movie theater in San Diego, sending theatergoers at a Saturday matinee of 'Les Miserables' diving for cover.

Officers say Tom Billodeaux, 20, of Escondido, California, pulled a handgun on them after they discovered sitting with 15 other people in the dark theater at Reading Cinemas Carmel Mountain.

San Diego police armed with assault rifles stormed the cinema and went theater-to-theater looking for Billodeaux after he allegedly threatened his girlfriend and a bystander with a pistol and then fled into the megaplex.

The terrifying incident, which saw screaming movie patrons hiding behind their seats and fleeing in fear after a gunfire erupted in a move theater bore dark echos the massacre of a late-night screening of 'The Dark Night Rises' in July in Aurora, Colorado.

James Holmes allegedly killed 12 people and wounded 58 others after he attacked unsuspecting theatergoers with an AR-15 assault rifle and smoke grenades.

Captain Terry McManus told U-T San 
Diego that police searched theater by theater and evacuated moviegoers 
until two officers spotted Billodeaux in a theater with about 15 others.

McManus said the man initially 
complied with officers' order to put his hands up, but then he put them 
back in his lap and brandished a handgun. He said one of the officers 
opened fire.

The officers thought their lives were 
threatened, he said, 'and more importantly, they thought the lives of 
others were in jeopardy.'

Billodeaux was shot in the chest and the arm. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition, though he is expected to survive.

No was else was injured. Police say he was sitting apart from the other patrons in the theater - though it was not known how close the nearest bystander was.

Later, investigators said they did not believe Billodeaux intended to shoot anyone in the theater and was merely hiding from authorities.

Billodeaux became the target of an intense police search after witnesses reported seeing him get into a fight with his girlfriend across the street from a shopping plaza where the Cineplex is located, Lieutenant Ernie Herbert said.

Witnesses tried to intervene, but he threatened them with a gun and ran to the shopping plaza.

The owner of a business next to the Cineplex said police shut down the shopping center's parking lot and stopped every car to look for the man. Officers with dogs checked each store, while a police helicopter hovered above.

'There were 20 police cars blocking the entrance, then the fire truck and the ambulance rushed in,' Steve Krongard, the owner of the Nickel City arcade, said. 'Then we saw seven cops with what looked like rifles, then paramedics went into the theater.'

Herbert said police turned their attention to the Cineplex after learning that an armed man had ducked into the Cineplex.

The theater's manager told Krongard the shooting occurred during a screening of 'Les Miserables.'

A moviegoer told KGTV the lights suddenly went on during the film and two officers came into the theater with their guns. Another witness told the station that everyone got on the floor and started heading for the exit doors.

McManus said the gunman never made any threats to others in the theater. He said the man had left a suicide note at his Escondido home before going to his girlfriend's workplace to confront her.

It was the second shooting at a San Diego County movie theater in as many days.

A concession worker suffered an arm injury when a shot fired outside a San Marcos movie theater went through the lobby window and struck her, sheriff's officials said.

The shooting occurred during a fight in the parking lot at Edwards San Marcos Stadium 18 and triggered a large police response because authorities were initially not sure whether there was a shooter inside the Cineplex.

No arrests have been reported after the San Marcos shooting.
