Armed police officers were pictured using a specially adapted Land Rover developed by the SAS to storm a second floor flat in upmarket Royal Leamington Spa.

The officers used the mobile assault platform normally used for tackling terrorist sieges to raid a suspected drugs den at 2.30pm yesterday.

At least five officers wearing protective kit stormed into the flat, backed by undercover colleagues on the busy road as shocked shoppers looked on.

Passers-by in the Warwickshire Regency town said they saw the officers hurling smoke bombs into the window.

Jeremy Brindley, 34, who was walking passed when the officers arrived, said: 'I heard several loud bangs before I realised what was going on.

'They had a Land Rover with a ladder on the front.

'Apparently, the downstairs door was reinforced so they used the Land Rover to get in upstairs.

'The police were masked and threw in smoke bombs.They didn't take any chances. There were undercover police on the ground filming the whole thing.

'There was another officer with a big power drill. The whole thing was unbelievable.'

Armed police also used smoke bombs during the operation, which led to three arrests 

After the incident local residents took to Facebook speculating whether the operation was actually a terror raid.

Writing on the 'Spotted: Leamington Spa' resident David Prosser wrote: 'Must be terrorists with a landrover (sic) like that.'

Nigel Goddard added: 'LOL a bit OTT for a drug raid..Bet it cost more to raid than what they found!!'

Police confirmed a 32-year-old man from Warwick, a 31-year-old man from Rugby and a 23-year-old from Kenilworth were arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs.

They were bailed until November 13.

A spokesperson for Warwickshire Police said: 'Police attended an address on the High Street at around 2.30pm on September 8.

'Three arrests were made on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs. 

'A large amount of what is thought to be Class A drugs was seized from the property.'

The Land Rover mounted assault platform was developed for officers from a system used by the SAS.

The raid took place as Home Secretary Theresa May gave a speech to the Police Superintendent's Annual Conference in the town and Prince Harry introduced the Invictus Games at nearby Jaguar Land Rover in Gaydon, Warwickshire.
