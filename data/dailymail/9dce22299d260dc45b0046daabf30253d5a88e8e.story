Swimmer Michael Klim has urged fans to help bring his 'dear friend' Nico White home to Australia from Bali, after he suffered the 'worst possible' brain injury in a motorbike crash.

Mr White was hit by a car while riding in the Kerobokan area in the early hours of Friday.

The 43-year-old Australian is in an induced coma in a Bali hospital, while his family scrambles to raise the $100,000 needed for his medical evacuation.

'Our dear friend Nicho White who lives in Bali was in a serious accident and is fighting for his life in intensive care and needs your help to get him back home for treatment ASAP,' Klim wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday.

'Head to Save Nicho White Appeal and donate now, please I’m begging you,' the Olympian added.

Klim also lives in Bali with his wife Lindy, a Balinese princess.

Mr White remains in intensive care in a Denpasar hospital after his accident, which is costing his Melbourne family up to $6000 a day.

The once-fit surfer is suffering from serious head, chest and leg injuries and doctors have advised it will be best to medically evacuate him to Australia, at a cost of around $100,000.

Celebrities including high profile fashion designers such as Alice McCall and Nicholas Morley have already contributed to the fundraising page.

Ms McCall wrote: 'Dear White Mcgills, you are like family to me, I hope this donation can help with Nicho’s fight to service. He is a strong sweet kind funny talented human being who is meant to be here with us on earth for years to come. Nicho there is so much love for you, shine on .Alice xxxx'.

Stepfather Ian McGill said attempts to bring Mr White out of the coma have so far been unsuccessful.

'In the scheme if seriousness, I think the doctor said it's the worst he's seen in terms of possible brain injury,' Mr McGill told AAP on Tuesday.

'We really don't know what the outcome will be,' he continued.

Mr White did not have medical insurance, and the other motorist who was involved is unable to contribute

Mr White was hit by a car while riding his motorbike early on Friday morning

The accident happened in the beachside town of Kerobokan in Bali

A fundraising page on the website youcaring.com has so far raised more than $91,000 - slowly climbing to its goal of $250,000.

The fundraiser was set up by his stepfather Ian McGill, and Ian's wife Lyn McGill.

The campaign states: 'We have set up this fundraising website because so many generous people have been offering to contribute to the increasing medical expenses for Nicho's care following his terrible motorbike accident.

'On Friday morning, May 16, Nicho was riding his motorbike along Kerobokan and was knocked off the road by a car, driven by a poor Indonesian man who has no money to contribute.'

So far, attempts to bring the 43-year-old out of the coma have been unsuccessful

Mr White’s family has made a desperate plea to raise funds to bring him home for medical treatment as he did not have medical insurance

Mr McGill said support has come from Melbourne, where he and Lyn lived until two years ago, and Bali, a second home for years before that.

In Bali, Mr White designs jewellery and his sister Jessie is the founder of fashion label Shakuhachi, with stores in Bali and Australia.

There were initial reports the accident was a hit-and-run, however, Bali police have not confirmed they are treating it as such.

Family will be holding a fundraising event at Lacalaca Bali, a restaurant in Seminyak this coming Thursday and all proceeds from behind and bar and cash donations will go towards Nicho's medical expenses.

Support: Nicho's friends are helping raise the much needed funds
