Kim Sears was right by Andy Murray's side as he beat skilled opponent Philipp Kohlschreiber in the French Open third round match this afternoon.

The glamorous artist, 25, went through every emotion as she watched her partner struggle then sprint to victory against the German player at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris.

She wore a pared down black top and graphic blue and white printed trousers to watch Andy finally win in a tense two-day match, prevailing 12-10 in the fifth set.

Ever loyal and at her Glaswegian boyfriend's side, long-time tennis WAG Sears supported Murray from the sidelines.

She made her way to the players' box looking the picture of Prisian chic in a low-key ensemble accessorised with stacked silver bracelets, tortoiseshell sunglasses shielding her eyes form the sun and carrying a stylish taupe handbag.

Despite having her own successful company painting animal portraits - not to mention a boyfriend worth millions - Kim always looks to the high street for her courtside outfits.

And her invaluable support courtside means everything to Murray and his team.

Murray, 27, has famously praised her 
ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as 
‘fundamental’ to their relationship.

He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’

Murray's own mother once described Sears as the 'best thing' to happen to her son.

The happy couple have been dating for nine 
years and have no official plans to marry yet.

They met at the 2005 US Open in 2005 when Sears was 
travelling with her father Nigel, former Lawn Tennis Association head of 
women's tennis.

She was just 17 and 
studying for her A levels in drama, music and art. Murray was her first serious boyfriend.

She subsequently got straight As and went on to study English Literature at the University of Sussex in Brighton.

Murray struggled at first, against his strong German opponent, before wining 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 12-10

The couple now share a £5m mansion in Oxshott, Surrey with their two dogs Maggie May and Rusty.

Sears has followed Murray across the globe supporting him in his championship matches in an admirable show of affection.

She is also a talented artist and has a website, Brushes and Paws, about her pet portraits.

Tennis fans would say she has 
done an admirable job helping transform Murray into a calm, confident player, and boosting his image.

He now faces Fernando Verdasco, who almost crushed his Wimbledon dreams last year, in the fourth round.
