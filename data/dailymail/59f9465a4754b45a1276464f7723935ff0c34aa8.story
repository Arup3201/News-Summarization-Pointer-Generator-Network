Adnan Januzaj has welcomed Louis van Gaal's appointment as Manchester United manager and claimed the club have a great future ahead of them under the Dutch manager.

Van Gaal has described United as the "biggest club in the world", but after leading Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich to silverware over the past 20 years he has experience of delivering results on the big stage.

Januzaj, 19, broke into the United side under former manager David Moyes and was a rare highlight of the Scot's otherwise troubled reign at Old Trafford.

And he will hope to do enough to continue his exciting development when Van Gaal arrives at the club this summer.

'I feel very happy because he is a great manager, he won a lot and I am looking forward to working with him,' he said in an interview with Sky Sports.

'I think we're going to have a great future ahead so I am looking forward to it.'

Januzaj also expressed his delight at the decision to keep Ryan Giggs at the club after he was named as Van Gaal's assistant.

United legend Giggs managed the club on a caretaker basis for the final four Premier League games of the season following the departure of Moyes.

There was speculation that Van Gaal could opt to dispense with the services of Giggs from the United coaching staff, but it was announced that he would work alongside the new manager.

Januzaj is happy with the appointment, saying: 'Everytime I was playing on the pitch I was asking Giggsy how to play and for some advice about what to do on the pitch. He helped me a lot.

'He was a great player and he has got a lot of respect from me and from other players and from other people.

'I think it is very important to have someone like him at the club.'
