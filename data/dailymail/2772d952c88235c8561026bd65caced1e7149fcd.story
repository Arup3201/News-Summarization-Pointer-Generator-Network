A dog who has solved murder mysteries and put criminals behind bars is stepping down to make way for the next generation.

Ellie, a 13-year-old springador - a Labrador Springer Spaniel cross - has worked on more than 1000 cases with West Midlands Fire Service as a fire investigation dog for the past seven years.

She is trained to work out how fires started by using her advanced sense of smell to hunt for traces of the flammable liquids used to set buildings alight.

A new generation of fire investigation dogs are moving in and here West Midlands Fire Service handler Matt Dixon asks his dog to sniff out residues of fuel which may have been used to start a fire

And she’s been so successful she’s even put people behind bars for murder.

Working with fire and police crime scene investigation teams she’s managed to sniff out evidence leading to criminal convictions and prevent insurance fraud by proving a fire was started deliberately.

Her sense of smell is so strong that if you put a single drop of petrol at one end of a football pitch, Ellie would be able to smell it from the other end.

Sometimes a trace of petrol is so small that bringing in Ellie is the only chance of finding that vital piece of evidence.

But Ellie’s story didn’t have the happiest of starts.

After being badly trained as a gun dog she was given away by owners who didn’t want her any more.

She eventually found herself in the hands of a dog trainer who noticed her special skills and passed her onto the West Midlands Fire Service.

Now at retirement age, Ellie has hung up her helmet and will live out her days at home with handler Matt Dixon, his wife Sarah, 37, and two children Thomas, nine, and Tabitha, three.

The fire service won’t be left without a detective dog though, as Mr Dixon has trained Peppa, a five-year-old Pointer, and Kai, a 14-month-old Belgian Shepherd to carry on her work.

Mr Dixon, from West Midlands Fire Service, said:‘It’s a pleasure to work with such a talented lovely-natured dog and I’m so proud of what she’s achieved.

‘We have done jobs where the evidence she has found has been instrumental in getting a conviction.

‘It’s always nice to know that criminals wouldn’t have been brought to justice without our work.

‘It is a fantastic feeling knowing that your dog has gone there, played a game, and the result of that is that someone dangerous was taken off the streets.’

In April 2013, Ellie was brought to a fire in Tyseley, Birmingham, to try and shed light on how the blaze had started.

The owner of the house, Mohammed Inayat, claimed robbers had started the fire, in which his wife Naika died, and their three daughters were injured.

When Ellie investigated the interior of the house she found evidence that the fire was started on purpose

But when Ellie found traces of flammable liquid at the property, police were able to work out the real cause of the blaze - Inayat.

It transpired that Inayat had set fire to the family home in a bid to stop his daughet, Kalsoom Bibi, from moving to Dubai and marrying a policeman.

He said she had brought ‘dishonour on the family’, because he did  not approve of her partner, before pouring gallons of petrol over his family home and setting it alight.

Naika died of carbon monoxide poisoning and one of his daughters, 16-year-old Saimah, who jumped from a bedroom window, suffered 50 per cent burns.

He was found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court of murdering his wife and arson but was cleared of attempted murder of his three daughters.

During his trial the court heard how the father-of-six soaked seven parts of his home in petrol at about 5am as his family slept - only hours before Miss Bibi, 28, was set to fly to Dubai to marry the CID officer.

After initially telling police the fire was started by ‘a gang led by a white middle-aged woman’, he was convicted of murder and arson with intent and sentenced to life prison in October 2013.
