A Swedish restaurant is taking a walk on the wild side this Christmas by offering up bear, reindeer and beaver.

Tyrol at Grona Lund amusement park in Stockholm is introducing bear meatballs alongside a beaver sausage and seven different reindeer dishes.

Thankfully, for those with a sentimental connection to Rudolph and the John Lewis advert, the 115ft long Christmas Table buffet also offers a vegan menu.

Although they are a people better known for minimalist interior design (IKEA) and mainstream fashion (H&M), come Christmas dinner, the Swedes are all about excess.

In fact, the meal on Christmas Eve is not referred to as dinner, but Christmas Table – a buffet loaded with everything from pickled herrings to meatballs.

The traditional Swedish Christmas Table also includes roast ham, Christmas sausage, spare ribs, gravadlax, beetroot salad and Jansson's Frestelse - a casserole dish made of potatoes, pickled sprats and cream.

However, Tyrol has chosen a more unusual route for their menu with a Wild Christmas Table featuring dishes from the northern parts of Sweden where game is a common addition.

No need to starve: 'Round three' of the Christmas Table buffet has 26 different types of meats and pates, including boar, bear and deer sausage, smoked reindeer heart and beaver steak

For £62, diners pick from seven ‘rounds’ – named so after the number of times you traditionally return to the buffet table to refill your plate – which consists of herring, salmon, cold meats, entrees, cheese table, dessert and ice cream 'rounds'.

Tyrol’s Christmas Table boasts reindeer-steak eggs, smoked reindeer heart, reindeer pastrami, orange- and cognac-cured reindeer topside, smoked reindeer, whole grilled reindeer and Souvas - a traditional Sami reindeer dish.

Sweden has the strongest support for hunting in the world with 87 per cent of the population backing the practice, but Tyrol also offers a completely vegan alternative to their Wild Christmas Table.

The slightly smaller PETA-friendly menu includes vegan ham and meatballs, 'mustard pickle herring'-flavoured aubergine and soy Christmas sausage.

Tyrol are keen to highlight that although the idea of beaver, bear and Rudolph may sound unconventional, game is one of the most sustainable meats out there.

Both the beaver and the bear meat are provided by local hunters in southern Lapland and Angermanland county in the north of Sweden and the reindeer meat is farmed by the Sami community, the indigenous people living in northern Scandinavia.

‘Wild meat is as ecological as it gets,’ says Samuel Cabrera, head chef at Tyrol.

‘We always try to keep a balance between offering the classic dishes and surprising our guests with something new.

‘It is going to be really exciting to see how the beaver sausage is received by our guests and we have also composed a new salad with moose meat.’

‘Food is so much about inspiration and that can come at any time,’ chef Henrik Stensved adds.

This season, Tyrol's Wild Christmas Table celebrates 30 years following the mantra 'from nature to plate'.
