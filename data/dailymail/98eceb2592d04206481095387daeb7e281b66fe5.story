Children from deprived areas of England are twice as likely to be obese as those living in more affluent parts of the country, according to new figures.

The latest statistics for children aged 10 to 11 show that 24.7 per cent from low-income areas are obese, compared to 13.1 per cent in more affluent locations.

While 9.5 per cent of four to five year olds are obese, that figure doubles to 19 per cent by the time children leave primary school. 

The data, published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, relates to the 2013/14 school year.  

Children living in deprived areas are more likely to be obese. In reception class children in Hackney had the highest rates of obesity (14.4%) while those in Windsor and Maidenhead had the lowest rates (5.5%). In year six rates ranged from 26.7% in Southwark to 11.1% in Richmond upon Thames

Eustace de Sousa, national lead for children, young people and families at Public Health England (PHE), described the figures - which are for children in state schools - as 'deeply concerning'. 

He said: 'We know that over a third of children leaving primary school are overweight or obese, which makes them much more likely to be overweight or obese as adults and considerably increases their risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems.

'Tackling obesity, and in particular childhood obesity, has always been a national priority for PHE.'

In reception class, more than one in five (22.5 per cent) children were classified as overweight or obese, 0.3 per cent higher than in 2012-13.

In year six, more than a third (33.5 per cent) were overweight or obese - a rise of 0.2 per cent from last year.

Mr de Sousa said: 'Parents and carers can help their children maintain a healthy weight by following a balanced diet, keeping an eye on portion sizes and limiting sugary drinks and sugary or fatty snacks.

'Change4life offer simple, affordable recipes including family meals for £5 and ideas on small swaps families can make to their diets, like swapping sugary drinks for diet or sugar free versions, water or lower fat milk, to remove excess calories.

'Children also need a minimum of 60 minutes of exercise each day, which can be achieved in one session or through shorter bursts of 10-minute activity.'

The local authority with the highest obesity rate for reception aged children was Hackney (14.4 per cent), while Windsor and Maidenhead was the lowest (5.5 per cent).

In year six, obesity rates ranged from 26.7 per cent in Southwark to 11.1 per cent in Richmond upon Thames.

The prevelance of obesity was found to be higher for boys in both year groups. 

In reception, 9.9 per cent of boys and 9 per cent of girls were classified as obese, while in year six the rate was 20.8 per cent for boys and 17.3 per cent for girls.

Meanwhile the overall prevalence of underweight children was lower in reception (0.9 per cent) than in year six (1.4 per cent).
