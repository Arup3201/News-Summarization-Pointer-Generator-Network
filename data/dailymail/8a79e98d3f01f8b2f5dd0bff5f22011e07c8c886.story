Tributes and condolences are flowing through social media in the wake of the tragedy of eight children after they were found stabbed to death in their home on Friday morning.

The tight-knit community of Cairns has set up a Facebook group called Children of Murray Street, which has more than 7,000 followers since it was created less than 24 hours ago.

Rocked by the news that eight of their own had been taken too soon, more than 100 residents of Manoora gathered at Munroe Martin Park bearing candles and flowers to lay on the ground.

Grief stricken members of the community also took to social media to express their love, support and sorrow, as well as their disbelief at the tragic event, coming just days to Christmas.

The children, aged between 18 months and 15 years, were reportedly discovered by their 20-year-old brother at the family home in Manoora, outside of Cairns, Queensland, along with a woman who had suffered a stab wound to the chest.

A woman, 37, believed to be the mother of seven of the children, was also rushed to hospital in a critical condition  but was assisting police.

Grieving residents of Manoora, which has been described as a 'tight-knit community', gathered to pay their respects at the park, while friends and relatives visited Cairns City Church. 

The mourners were invited to observe a minute's silence for the children on Friday night.

Neighbours, friends, and family members had visited the Murray Street house on Friday to lay flowers, notes, and stuffed toys.

Pastor Michael Dalla Vecchia called on the people of Cairns to 'stick together as a community'.

The Bishop of Cairns James Foley also issued a statement about the tragedy.

'To say this has been a dreadful week is almost an obscene understatement: the Sydney siege; an 18 year old taken by a shark off Pt. Douglas; the Pakistan school massacre; and on Friday’s 1pm radio news the headline that eight children had been stabbed at a Cairns suburb - Manoora. And all this in the week before Christmas,' the statement said.

'Yet, as we saw in the aftermath of the Sydney siege, the very worst some people can do - may bring out the very best in so many more.'
