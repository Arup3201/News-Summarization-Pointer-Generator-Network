This teenage girl has fulfilled an amphibious ambition after becoming Britain's first professional mermaid.

Emily Keat, 19, from Wadebridge, Cornwall, built her own 6 ft tail and trained for four hours a day to turn herself into a full-time half-woman half-fish performer.

The former model now specialises in so-called mer-modelling, mer-acting and performing other related mer-entertainment.

She created the scaly outfit by laboriously stitching together old 
swimsuits to create a glittery skirt and fin - and has even died her hair red 
to resemble her idol Ariel, The Little Mermaid.

After leaving college she launched herself as a professional mermaid and makes a living from children's parties, modelling and special events such as promoting clean beaches.

Emily said: 'I absolutely love being a mermaid - I couldn't imagine doing anything else.

'I watched videos and looked at pictures, and was amazed at how realistic and graceful they are.

'I have always being interested in mythical creatures. When I was younger I wanted to be a fairy.

Emily has already had several modelling jobs and children's parties, but is looking to expand her repertoire

'But making a fairy costume didn't seem practical. I could make some wings that looked really lifelike but they would never be able to fly.

'With a mermaid tail I would actually be able to swim like a mermaid.

'I wasn't sure it would work in the water. But once I had made it I tried it out and was amazed at how well it worked.'

Emily used her arts and crafts skills to sow together Lycra swimsuits sealed them with silicone bonding to make her tail.

The DIY tail worked perfectly and she 
spent the summer learning to dive, swim and hold her breath underwater 
to emulate Disney's Ariel.

Emily said she grew up obsessed with fantasy creatures and fairies but decided against becoming a Tinkerbell impersonator - because she wouldn't be able to fly.

The teen, who recently completed a foundation degree at Truro and Penwith College, said: 'Swimming in the tail takes time to master and it can feel like you're sinking at times - but it's faster and I'm becoming better and better at it.

'Ultimately I want to raise awareness of keeping the seas clean and safe for marine animals. I want to use this as a platform for doing good.

'I want to educate children about sea pollution in a way that's fun so they will enjoy it and learn at the same time.'

Emily's biggest inspiration was Mermaid Melissa, a famous aquatic performer from the US who glides through the water thanks to a bespoke £3,500 tail.
