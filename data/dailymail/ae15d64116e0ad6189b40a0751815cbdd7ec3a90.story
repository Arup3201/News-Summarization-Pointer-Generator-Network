If your home is in Hartlepool, Newport, Sunderland or Newcastle upon Tyne, you should probably look away now.

While house prices are plunging around Britain, particularly in these cities, there is one gold-plated corner of the capital where a garage is on the market for more than £500,000.

Hidden in a tiny back street close to Harrods, the double garage does not look special from the outside.

The garage on the little-known Rysbrack Street is painted black, but not that recently, and the brown brickwork around the garage has been blackened by dirt.

Expensive: This garage, in Rysbrack Street, Knightsbridge, is on the market for £525,000

But it has just been put on the market with the highest price tag ever charged for a garage by the estate agency WA Ellis, which was founded in 1868.

At a record price of £525,000, the buyer could buy three of Britain’s ‘average’ homes, which currently cost £160,000 each, for the same price, and still have £45,000 left over in change.

It is possible to swing a cat in the garage, but only just - it measures 6.4 metres wide and just 4.75 metres deep.

Robert Lewis, an associate at W A Ellis, insists the garage is ‘exceptionally valuable’ because it is ‘very rare’ for a freehold garage in Knightsbridge to come up for sale.

He said: ‘We anticipate interest from those already living within a two or three minute walk of the garage.

'For example, the large houses on Walton Place where there is no off-street parking.’

The garage was put up for sale a week after a  flat-roofed brick shed, in Highgate village, north London, went on the market for £259,950.

Ironically, news of the garage’s record asking price emerged on the day that official figures reveals house prices continue to drop sharply around the country.

Overall, house prices have dropped by 0.6 per cent over the last year to an average price of £160,372, but the regional picture is far more worrying for many hard-working homeowners.

For those who bought in 2007 - the year that house prices peaked in many parts of Britain but the credit crunch began - the figures, from the Land Registry, are particularly gloomy.

In Hartlepool, the price of the average home has dropped by nearly a third since homes in the city peaked at an average of £110,743 in October 2007.

Today the same home is worth £75,786, which means a homeowner has seen around £35,000 wiped off the value of their home since that date.

Others have also been hit hard.

Over the last year, for example, prices have dropped by eight per cent in Newport, by 8.9 per cent in Sunderland and by 6.4 per cent in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Meanwhile, they have reached an all-time peak in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which includes the Rysbrack Street garage.

The average price in the exclusive borough is close to £1million, having shot up by nearly 11 per cent over the last year.

Knightsbridge is located in London's Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

In the past four and a half years, average property prices in the borough have risen from £827,238 to £983,842.

One of the most exclusive properties in Knightsbridge, and indeed, London, is One Hyde Park, in which one flat was sold for an incredible £136 million in April 2011.

The high rise building comprises 33 penthouses registered with a combined value of £727m.

Between October 2011 and December 2011, 553 properties were sold in Kensington and Chelsea

In October 2007 - the month that property prices peaked in Hartlepool - the average price in Kensington and Chelsea was £827,238.

Today it is £983,842.

This is a rise of just over £150,000, an increase which the vast majority of homeowners in Britain can only dream their home will ever be worth.

Peter Rollings, chief executive of the estate agency Marsh & Parsons, said prime parts of London are very attractive to foreign buyers wanting a safe haven for their cash.

He said: ‘Central London’s bricks and mortar has long been the first port of call for investors - whether from the UK or abroad - looking to guard their wealth against economic uncertainty.

‘This will perpetuate demand for the limited stock of quality property in prime London, driving a larger wedge between London’s market and the rest of the country.’

The consultancy Capital Economics predicts average house prices in Britain will be around five per cent lower by the end of the year than they were in January.
