TRES BORING

Expert’s advice: Parisian stylist Noemie Olivero says the secret to French women’s style is that they follow strict rules. ‘French women know never to wear hemlines above the knee; short skirts make a woman look cheap,’ she says. ‘Flattering navy is the key colour for French women, followed by white, grey and black.

Annabel’s verdict: Noemie’s outfit certainly follows her all-important rules. But while this might all be the height of good taste, blimey, is it boring! 2/5

SEXY SENORITA

Expert’s advice: For Rocio Temboury, a top stylist from Malaga, the key to Spanish dressing is clothes which are figure-hugging and overtly feminine. ‘There is no age barrier to feeling attractive in Spain,’ she says. ‘Spanish women typically like short, fitted jackets; pencil skirts and heels and classic styles. ‘We love bright colours and bold prints.’

Annabel’s verdict: I would normally run a mile from an outfit as loud as this, but I loved it. The fitted jacket and figure-hugging skirt gave me curves I didn’t know I had. Classic — and sexy.’ 4/5

NO THANKS, YANKS

Expert’s advice: Top stylist Destinie Adelakun says that New York style is cool, calm and confident. ‘The best-dressed women choose clothes which exude relaxed elegance,’ she says. ‘They like tailored suits and soft blouses in muted colours. And they invest in their bodies as much as their wardrobes. Even in middle age, they are not afraid to wear hemlines above the knee or dresses which reveal their upper arms.’

Annabel’s verdict: I like the lower heel, but the dress is too revealing. I’d need to spend several months in the gym first to really pull it off! 3/5

OH, BELLISSIMA!

Expert’s advice: Sara Calabrese, a celebrity stylist from Rome, describes the quintessential Italian look as ‘flamboyant’, adding: ‘In Italy women like to flaunt their best assets. They choose figure-hugging clothes which accentuate their curves. They have no problem with showing cleavage. And Italian women never look scruffy, so I think this is one reason why they have such a reputation for being stylish.’

Annabel’s verdict: Mamma Mia! This outfit exudes classic filmstar glamour. I can see why, at 50, Monica Bellucci has been chosen to be a Bond girl. 5/5
