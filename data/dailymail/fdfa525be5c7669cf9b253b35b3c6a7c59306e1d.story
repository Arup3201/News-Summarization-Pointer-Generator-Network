A 23-year-old clubber who found another woman's engagement ring in her handbag after a drunken night out is looking to find its mystery owner.

Sophie Reynolds, from Lincoln, posted an appeal on Facebook to find the owner after discovering the expensive antique gold and pearl band in her bag last Sunday.

She doesn't know how she came to end up with the possible family heirloom but remembered consoling a tearful blonde woman in a takeaway who was complaining of a cheating fiance.

Sophie Reynolds, 23, from Lincoln, found the expensive antique gold and pearl band in her handbag following a drunk night out in the city. She believes it belongs to a mystery blonde who she consoled in a takeaway

Sophie Reynolds posted an appeal on her Facebook page, above, on January 12, to find the mystery owner of the expensive ring

She said: 'Me and my friends were out celebrating a birthday at a club called Lola Lo’s in Lincoln.

'We had a good night and as we were going to get a taxi home I popped into a local kebab house to get a pizza.

'Once
 I ordered, I looked across the counter and saw this girl crying, she 
was on her own and had her head in her hands on the counter so I went 
over to see if she was okay.

Sophie Reynolds, from Lincoln, above, posted an appeal on Facebook to find the woman who owned the engagement ring. She believes the antique could be a possible family heirloom and wants to return it to owner

'I asked her what was wrong and she told me she had just found out her fiance had cheated on her, she was distraught.

'We spoke for about ten or 15 minutes and I kept trying to calm her down and told her she deserved better.

'I
 vaguely remember her taking the ring off and telling me that she needed
 to get closure from the relationship and the only way to do that was to
 get rid of the ring.

'I don’t remember taking it from her, I think 
she must have just put it in the bag, but soon after she said that we 
said our goodbyes and I got in a taxi home.'

Despite their heart-to-heart at around 4.30am in the Charcoal Grill takeaway in Lincoln, 
neither of the girls exchanged numbers or even got one another’s name.

The
 next evening Sophie emptied her bag and noticed in a zip compartment 
that she had the woman’s ring - which she believes may be a family 
heirloom.

She took to her Facebook profile page, under the name Soph 
Lincolnpartygirl Reynolds, and posted an appeal to the girl.

She wrote: 'The drunk blonde girl that was 
crying in charcoal grill last night because her fiancé had cheated on 
her!... I have your engagement ring just found it in my bag!! Oops'

She said: 'When I found it, it gave me a flashback and I started to 
remember the conversation, but I was sure I didn’t take the ring from 
her, she must have put it in there.

'I felt horrible, I still do and I just want to find her and give it back to her.

'All I know is that she had blonde hair, was wearing a black-and-red tartan top and spoke with a Yorkshire accent.

'I
 have looked on the clubs website at pictures and haven’t found her, I 
don’t know if she was from the area, she might have been visiting.

The appeal by Sophie Reynolds, above, has gone viral with people around the world sharing her message on Facebook and Twitter. Despite the world-wide publicity, the ring's owner still hasn't come forward

'But
 the ring is lovely, it looks like a family heirloom and I am sure she 
is missing it, I have called the club and they don’t know anything about
 it. All I want to do is find her and  give it back to her. It does 
looks old fashioned and worn, but it looks like it has sentimental 
value. It could have been passed down by generations of a family and now
 I’ve got it.

'I shouldn’t have it and just want to get it back to its rightful owner.'

Miss Reynolds said she was 'amazed' at the world-wide response she received after posting the original appeal Facebook.

She said: 'When I tweeted picture 
of the ring and an appeal for help I wasn’t really expecting any 
responses but within hours I was getting messages from around the world.

'People
 were desperate to find out if they could help and some said they 
recognised the ring. It was amazing, the appeal went viral, it was mad.'
