Cher has turned down the chance to open Russia's Winter Olympics next year in protest of the country's anti-gay laws

Cher has turned down the chance to open next year's Winter Olympics in Russia as a protest to the country's new anti-gay laws.

The singer refused the offer in retaliation of legislation introduced earlier this year which makes it illegal to teach under 18s about homosexuality.

The 67-year-old, whose son Chaz underwent gender transition surgery in 2010, is the latest celebrity to react against the laws brought in by Vladimir Putin's government in June.

She said: ‘I can’t name names but my friend called who is a big oligarch over there and asked me if I’d like to be an ambassador for the Olympics and open the show.

‘I immediately said no. I want to know why all of this gay hate just exploded over there. He said the Russian people don’t feel the way their government does.’

Cher, who this year headlined at a Gay Pride concert in New York, admitted feeling ‘frightened’ after her daughter Chaz told her she was having surgery to become a man in 2008

The singer, who recently released her 25th studio album, rose to fame as one half of the husband and wife duo Sonny and Cher, and said she feels able to relate to marginalised groups because of the initially frosty reception they received.

She told Canadian magazine Maclean’s: ‘People hated [Sonny Bono] and I in the early days because we looked and acted so different.

‘Sonny was always getting into fights-people would called him ‘f-g’ and he’d get his nose broken-only because we were dressing different. And these were our street clothes! You can’t forget that.’ 

She added of her son: ‘One time I called Chaz and he had forgot to change his voicemail and it was his old voice.

'It shook me a bit. These are small changes that as a mother you never forget.

'It is the last taboo. It used to be against the law. Thank God we’ve come so far.'

Gay rights activists have called for Russia to be removed as hosts of the Winter Olympics next year over the controversial laws which prohibit teaching under 18s about homosexuality.
