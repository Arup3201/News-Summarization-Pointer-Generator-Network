Arsenal face an anxious wait over Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's fitness after the midfielder suffered a groin injury against Newcastle.

Oxlade-Chamberlain will have an injection which the club hope will help the injury settle down and allow him to play against Liverpool on Sunday.

Arsene Wenger is already facing a midfield injury crisis, with Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta all on the treatment table, and now Oxlade-Chamberlain could also be missing over the busy Christmas period.

'He got a knock,' said Wenger on Oxlade-Chamberlain. 'He's got a pain in his groin. I took him off quickly. I wanted to take him off, and then he takes the ball and crosses the whole pitch and [after that piece of action] he cannot run anymore.

'We cannot afford to lose him at the moment. I hope it's nothing bad. He had a little bit of inflammation before the game. I took him to Galatasaray and maybe two games [in five days] was a lot for him.'

Defender Laurent Koscielny has already been ruled out of the trip to Anfield in another blow for Wenger. But the Arsenal boss could yet be boosted by the return of Theo Walcott, who hopes to be fit after a groin problem interrupted his return from a serious knee injury.
