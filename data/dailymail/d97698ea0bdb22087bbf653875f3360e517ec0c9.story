The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall got in touch with their creative side on a visit to The Art Workers' Guild on Thursday.

The royal couple met craftsmen and their apprentices at the launch of London Craft Week in Bloomsbury - and seemed to have a jolly good time.

A giggling Prince joked that he couldn't see as he tried on a pair of safety goggles as Camilla chuckled at her husband's expense in the background.

The couple also met designer Tom Dixon, with whom they shared a cup of tea. Camilla, 67, had a go at some gold embossing - and looked most amused by her efforts.

Resplendent in a red and blue tartan coat, the Duchess, who is Patron of Guild of St Bride, later toured the building's Crypt Museum, before attending a reception with the church's supporters.

The 66-year-old Prince, meanwhile, paid a visit to the St Bride Foundation to meet staff, hear about the work of the charity and meet printing apprentices learning to keep traditional skills alive.

The St Bride Foundation was established in 1891 as a recreational centre for the print and publishing industry on Fleet Street.

This is the second outing this week for the busy royal couple, who rubbed shoulders with celebrities, Bollywood stars and X Factor judges at a gala dinner for the British Asian Trust on Tuesday night.

The Prince of Wales, 66, was dapper in black tie and a natty patterned pocket square while Camilla, 67, looked resplendent in a floor-length plum velvet gown lined with matching silk.

The royal pair hosted the event at the Banqueting House, Whitehall, along with singer Ella Henderson, Simon Cowell and Holly Valance, to raise money for the charity Charles founded in 2007.

During the evening, Prince Charles was also pictured talking to X Factor judge Louis Walsh and Chelsea footballer Cesc Fabregas.

Charles joked with Indian actress Rani Mukerji, a top Bollywood star who glittered in a stunning gold sari.

Meanwhile, Camilla more than held her own against such a backdrop of such sparkling glamour in a stunning diamond serpent necklace, matching bracelet and large amethyst and diamond drop earrings. 

The British Asian Trust operates in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka to end abuse and exploitation, as well as improve education, healthcare and livelihoods in impoverished areas.

The event this year marked the launch of a new anti-trafficking fund for India supporting the work the Trust has undertaken in support of at risk girls affected by abuse and exploitation.

India is home to almost half of the world's trafficked population, according to royalcentral.co.uk, and the British Asian Trust has supported many programmes to embolden young, vulnerable girls, to take back their lives, including many who trafficked in the past.

The inaugural event in 2014 raised more than £500,000 to support grass-roots programmes across South Asia.

The British Asian Trust Ambassador, Nihal Arthanayake hosted the evening festivities while Chelsea footballer Cesc Fàbregas, Shahid Khan (aka Naughty Boy) and Goodness Gracious Me comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar OBE were also there.
