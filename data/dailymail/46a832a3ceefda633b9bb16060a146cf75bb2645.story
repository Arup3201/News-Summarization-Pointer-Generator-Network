Actress: Julie Goodyear, 72, has been involved in an off-screen conflict after a rogue fly-tipper dumped 10,000 tonnes of rubbish on her farm

As a former soap star, she is used to getting into dramatic situations on screen.

But now, ex-Corrie actress Julie Goodyear has been involved in an off-screen conflict after a rogue fly-tipper dumped 10,000 tonnes of rubbish on her farm.

Peter Cordwell, a waste disposal boss, arranged to supply materials for the construction of a horse exercise area on the 72-year-old's land in Heywood, Manchester.

He then illegally dumped a mass of hazardous waste on the site, including 16ft piles of soil, stone, liquid, ceramics, plastic, wood, straw and electrical equipment.

And unbeknown to Miss Goodyear, who played legendary Rovers Return landlady Bet Lynch on Coronation Street for almost four decades, he did not have the correct permit to deposit the rubbish.

Cordwell has now been fined £12,500 and ordered to pay costs of £16,521 after being found guilty of illegally dumping waste at Bury and Rochdale Magistrates' Court.

Miss Goodyear, who has an MBE for services to drama, bought Primrose Hill Farm in Rochdale 17 years ago - and has since spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating the property.

Acting on a tip-off, Environment Agency officers investigated the site and found a large area - measuring around 60m by 20m in size - that was swamped in 16.5ft of rubbish.

Officers subsequently contacted Miss Goodyear and no more deposits were made.

Cordwell, from Heywood, is 
believed to have been dumping waste on the actress's land for more than two years, from April 2009 to
 June 2011.

Illegally dumped: Unbeknown to Miss Goodyear, Cordwell did not have the correct permit to dispose of the waste (including this brown liquid, above). He has now been fined £12,500 and ordered to pay costs of £16,521

Mark
 Fowles, of the Environment Agency, said: 'We took 
the decision to launch a prosecution after investigations determined it 
was clear waste was being brought onto land without being permitted to 
do so.

'Illegally deposited waste has the potential to cause serious pollution incidents.

'This
 prosecution demonstrates that we take waste crime very seriously and 
will not hesitate to prosecute if necessary, to protect the environment 
and local communities.'

In a statement, a spokesman for Miss Goodyear said: 'Julie instructed Peter Cordwell to do some work on her land in accordance with planning permission which he was given copies of.

'She trusted him completely to abide by those rules and regulations.

'Julie is the victim here and she had no knowledge whatsoever of what he had done.'
