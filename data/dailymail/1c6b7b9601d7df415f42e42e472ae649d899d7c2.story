Despite the rising costs involved in attending university, the pursuit of a degree-level education is becoming increasingly common with each generation.

Roughly 41 percent of Americans aged 18 to 24 are currently enrolled in a two- or four-year degree-granting institution, compared with 25.5 percent enrolled in 1967, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

There is good reason to pursue a bachelor’s degree as in 2013 the typical American adult with a degree earned more than double someone with only a high school diploma.

Lake Havasu City-Kingman, Arizona, has topped a list of the least educated cities in the United States

Half of America's least educated cities are in California, although worst of all was Lake Havasu City-Kingman, Arizona

But as people with the best education move to areas with the best paid jobs, left behind are the nation’s cities with the lowest education levels.

These metropolitan areas are ‘stuck in a vicious cycle’, according to Pedro Noguera, professor of education at New York University.

‘Low levels of education make it difficult for them to attract businesses that pay higher wages.’

To rank the ten least educated cities in the U.S., 24/7 Wall St. reviewed metrics including cities with the lowest percentage of adults 25 and older with at least a bachelor’s degree, median household income, median earnings and the poverty rate.

The results produced a list of cities that have historically been dependent on agriculture and mining and which now find themselves without a foothold in the technology sector and other industries which are running the economy.

In second spot was Dalton, Georgia. Known as the carpet capital of the world, its economy was hammered by the Great Recession

The top ten least-educated cities are:
