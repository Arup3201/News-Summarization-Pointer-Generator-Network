A married couple in Oregon have been charged with murder following an investigation into the death of their newborn baby daughter.

Sarah Mangus, 29, and Jamie Mangus, 34, pleaded not guilty in a Portland court on Monday to the charges which date back to April 12, the day their daughter Krystal died just hours after she was born.

The child's cause of death was determined to be methamphetamine intoxication and neonatal pneumonia.

Sarah Mangus, 29, and Jamie Mangus, 34, have pleaded not guilty in a court in Portland, Oregon, to the charges which date back to April 12, the day their daughter Krystal died just hours after she was born

The meth was likely transferred from the placenta to the newborn, according to the Oregon State Medical Examiner's office.

Emergency crews were called to a home following reports that the baby wasn't breathing.

Detectives were able to determine that 
the child had been born 12 hours earlier at a different location in North Portland and 
had not received any medical attention, according to Portland police.Â 

The case was presented to a grand jury last week and the couple was arrested on Friday morning.

The couple were arrested on Friday, then arraigned on charges of murder by abuse and first-degree manslaughter on Monday and are set to face trial on Aug. 26

Sarah Mangus' mother Marie Dakota has blamed Krystal's death on the local hospital.

'My daughter did everything she could to get that baby up to the hospital after it was born. She cleaned it up, had it dressed in clothes and everything. The umbilical cord was clamped off real good,' she told Fox12.

'The baby had good color. The baby cried. The baby sucked the bottle. So, I don't agree with any of this.'

Both suspects were arraigned on charges 
of murder by abuse and first-degree manslaughter on Monday. They are set to face trial on Aug. 26.
