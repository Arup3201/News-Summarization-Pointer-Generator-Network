It is hard to imagine the mortification Benedict Cumberbatch felt after he used the word 'coloured' instead of 'black' when trying to make a point about the lack of roles available for ethnic minorities in the UK.

His regret will no doubt have been intensified by the fact, just less than two years ago, the painful matter of how his family made its fortune came under scrutiny when he starred in 12 Years A Slave.

Cumberbatch's ancestors were slave owners, boasting '250 negroes' on their sugar plantation in Barbados in the 18th and 19th centuries, and were given - on the abolition of the slave trade in the 1830s -  £6,000 to compensate for the loss of their 'human property'.

In today's money, the compensation would be the equivalent of more than £3.6m.

Now, MailOnline can show pictures of inside the plantation where hundreds of men and women toiled as slaves while his ancestors reaped the rewards.

Wealth: The Cumberbatch family owned Cleland Plantation, in Saint Andrew, Barbados, (pictured) for 100 years - during which time as many as 250 slaves

Slave trade: Abraham Cumberbatch - seen here in a portrait hanging in St Nicholas Abbey Planation - was Benedict Cumberbatch's seventh great-grandfather, and the first of his family to run a plantation using slaves

'Sort of apology': Benedict Cumberbatch as William Pitt the Younger, in 2006's Amazing Grace - a role he took as a 'sort of apology' for his family's part in the slave trade

The Cumberbatch family are aware of how their dark past at Cleland Plantation, in Saint Andrew, Barbados, is viewed by the wider world.

His mother, the actress Wanda Ventham, had urged him not to use his real surname professionally, in case it made him a target for reparation claims by the descendants of slaves.

But Cumberbatch, 38, has always been open about his history and, if anything, appears to have sought out roles which allow him no room to hide.  

The Oscar-nominee, who is up for the best actor gong on February 22, first spoke of it when he appeared in the abolition film Amazing Grace in 2006.

At the time, he half-joked he took the role of Willaim Pitt the Younger 'as a sort of apology' for his ancestry.

But it would be his role in the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave which would truly thrust the Cumberbatch history into the spotlight. 

Art imitating life: Cumberbatch played William Ford in the 2013 film, a plantation owner who was the first man to buy Solomon Northup, played by Ejiofor

Property: The people enslaved on the sugar plantation were seen as nothing more than property by Cumberbatch's ancestors: They were included in the overall value of the property, alongside the land, in the family's accounts

Comfortable: The Cumberbatch family were able to build up their wealth by using slaves to work on the sugar plantation - using it to create a comfortable lifestyle in the Caribbean country. Pictured is the sitting room at Cleland

The film, based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a 19th century black musician who was kidnapped and sold into the slave trade, saw Cumberbatch playing William Ford, the man who 'owned' Northup first.

It was a role which, surely, wasn't that far removed from his own ancestors, who moved to Barbados in the late 17th century.

The move was the idea of his eighth-great-grandfather, Joshua, who brought his wife Ann and three children half way across the world for a new life.

But Joshua died shortly after arrival and would never see the plantations his descendants would go onto own after his son Abraham built up the family fortune.

Modern day: Cumberbatch with his parents Wanda Ventham (left) and Timothy Carlton (right, with actress Tracie Bennett in 2012), who are both professional actors who even appeared alongside him in Sherlock. His mother Wanda warned him not to use his surname, for fear of reprisals fro the descendants of slaves

Will: Abraham had built up a significant fortune, but had no sons - so he left the plantation to his grandson, on the understanding he would change his surname to Cumberbatch, while also stipulating it would also 'be kept staffed with 250 negro slaves' and 150 cattle

Diversifying: Cumberbatch did not just own the farms however, he also built refineries, which helped to add ot his fortune. Pictured is an old map of the plantation

Rebellion: The family - whose members are thought to be buried at St Peter's Parish Church, in Barbados - left the country in 1820, four years after the slaves revolted in 1816, led by a man called Bussa - who worked on their plantation

Compensation: When the slave trade came to an end in 1838, Abraham Parry, Cumberbatch's great-great-great grandfather was given £6,000 for the loss of his human property. Pictured above is a worker on the plantation today

Empire: Cumberbatch's direct ancestors were not the only members of the family to own property on the island. The nearby St Nicholas Abbey plantation was also own by the Cumberbatch family

Abraham learned the basics of the sugar industry as a salaried plantation foreman, before buying up plantations in the early 18th century and building refineries to turn raw cane into sugar.

The family lived in comfort, in the white walled house with shuttered windows and large rooms where they could shelter from the heat. By the time he died in 1750, Abraham had built up a small fortune. 

But he had no son to inherit. His will showed his priorities: he left his estate to his grandson Abraham (his daughter's son) on the condition he changed his surname to Cumberbatch and stipulated that his plantation 'be kept staffed with 250 negro slaves and 150 head of cattle'.

Pastor: Cumberbatch's character in 12 Years A Slave was a pastor - yet did not disagree with owning other human beings

Faith: The inside of the church where Benedict's family once worshiped in Barbados

Working: The plantation is still going today, although underneath the ownership of a new family

Portrait: Yet more than 150 years after the Cumberbatch family left the plantation, a painting of Abraham Cumberbatch still stands in the hallway

Modern: The plantation was bought by 66-year-old Steven Tempro in 1985, and has been updated for modern living 

Workers rights: Today, the people who work on the plantation are all paid a fair wage for a day's work

Owner: Steven Tempro stands on the steps where Cumberbatch's ancestors once watched over their land

The plantations passed down the generations until 1816, when Abraham's grandson, Abraham Parry, faced a rebellion from one of his slaves. The uprising lasted two months until Bussa and an estimated 1,000 slaves were killed – another 214 slaves were executed and 123 shipped off the island.

But the writing was on the wall. In 1820 Abraham Parry returned to Britain to live at Fairwater House, a stately home, in Devon, which is now the site of Taunton School, and 18 years later the slave trade in Barbados was abolished – Cumberbatch great-great-great grandfather received more than £6,000 for the loss of their 'human' property.
