'Brutal Nazi sadist': An historian has claimed that Gestapo chief Heinrich Mueller (pictured) who oversaw the deaths of millions of Jews during the Holocaust was buried in Jewish cemetery

One of the chief architects of the Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews during WW2 is himself buried in a Jewish graveyard in Berlin, an historian claimed today.

Heinrich Mueller, the head of the feared Gestapo secret police who played a key role in the round-up and transportation of Europe’s Jews to death camps in occupied Poland, is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin Mitte, according to history professor Johanne Tuchel.

'Gestapo Mueller', who was one of the participants at the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 in which the extermination programme for the Jews was set in motion, was rumoured to have escaped to South America after the war.

His body was never found.

Tuchel, who heads the Berlin Memorial to German Resistance foundation, claims he died in the fierce fighting that engulfed Berlin at the end of the war in 1945.  

'His body was thrown into a mass grave at the Jewish Cemetery in Berlin Mitte in August 1945,' he said.

Professor Tuchel said he discovered the information in paperwork in 'various archives' even though western intelligence agencies for years suspected he had survived.  

In 1949, there was a sighting of him at the Czech town of Karlovy Vary, formerly the German spa resort of Karlsbad.

Architect of death: Professor Johanne Tuchel claims documents show Mueller was buried in his general's uniform with his ID papers in the left inside breast pocket of his tunic and his SS card

Heinrich Mueller remains the most senior figure of Nazi regime who has never been captured or confirmed dead.

He was a police official under both the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany before becoming chief of the Gestapo.

He was called 'Gestapo Mueller' to distinguish him from another SS general named Heinrich Müller.

As head of the Gestapo, he was present at the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 in which the holocaust was set in motion and later played a key role in the round-up and transportation of Europe’s Jews to death camps in occupied Poland.

He was last seen alive between 1am and 2am on May 2, 1945 when he left a military hospital at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. 

There were rumours he had fled to South America and in 1949, there was an apparent sighting of him at the Czech town of Karlovy Vary, formerly the German spa resort of Karlsbad.

But his body has never been found.

But Professor Tuchel claims documents 
show he was buried in the Jewish cemetery, near to the Luftwaffe 
ministry of Hermann Goering, in his general’s uniform with his ID papers
 in the left inside breast pocket of his tunic.  

Included in the paperwork was his SS identity card.

The death certificate turned up by Professor Tuchel states on it that Mueller was a Wehrmacht - German army - soldier.

In the confusion of the fall of Berlin, and in the administration of the divided city afterwards, the mistake went unnoticed until discovered by him earlier this year.

The likely scenario was that Mueller was interned in one grave near the Reich Chancellery shortly after his body was discovered and re-buried at the Jewish cemetery some months later.

The grave of Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn is near the site where Mueller is allegedly buried.

Dieter Graumann, leader of the Central 
Council for Jews in Germany, said: 'One of the most brutal Nazi sadists 
precisely being buried in a Jewish cemetery is a tasteless monstrosity.

'It tramples on the memory of the victims.' 

He was last seen alive between 1am and 2am on May 2, 1945 when he left a military hospital at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin.

Hitler had killed himself two days previously in his bunker.

Tuchel produced a document, reprinted by the Bild newspaper, dated March 31, 1948, from the Berlin Register Office Centre which states: 'He fell in the Reich Chancellery, is buried in the Jewish Cemetery.'

His address on the death notice was given as Nr 8 Prinz Albfecht Strasse - the wartime HQ of the Gestapo.

A gravedigger called Walter Lueders said: 'I compared this photo with the face of the corpse. I can say that the person shown on the photo was identical to the body.'
