Devastated: Clare Walker has been denied IVF on the NHS after years of trying to have children

A woman who dreamed of starting a family was refused IVF on the NHS – because her fiance already has children.

Clare Walker, 32, was left devastated after being told that the health service would not fund the fertility treatment.

Miss Walker first tried to get pregnant when she was in her early 20s, but doctors told her that she would not be able to conceive naturally due to problems with her fallopian tubes.

Two years ago she met her partner Matthew Garwell, and after getting engaged last summer the pair decided to apply for treatment so they could start a family.

Mr Garwell, who works as a glazier, has two children – Connor, nine, and eight-year-old Evie from a previous relationship – so the couple can not be classified as childless.

And during their first appointment at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, a nurse told them this meant they were not eligible for NHS-funded IVF.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that women aged 23 to 39 with fertility problems should be entitled to three cycles of IVF.

However prospective parents can find themselves at the mercy of regional variations, as local NHS clinical commissioning groups have the final say on who should be allowed treatment and how many cycles will be paid for.

Miss Walker said: ‘I’m having the right of being a mother snatched away from me and it is devastating. Every woman should have that right.

Guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggest that all women under 40 should have access to free IVF.

They should be referred for treatment after two years of trying to get pregnant, according to the guidelines - but if, like Ms Walker, they can only have a baby through IVF, they can start treatment straight away.

However, the guidelines are only voluntary, and hospitals are free to impose their own rules.In a bid to save money, many local NHS trusts will only fund IVF for women who do not have children already.

While it is possible to undergo private IVF treatment, each course costs around £5,000, making it unaffordable for many would-be mothers.

‘I have people deciding my future that have never met me or know my situation. They are playing God with my life.’

She added: ‘Becoming a mother means everything to me. I feel it is my purpose of being here.’

Miss Walker, from Downham Market, Norfolk, has now launched an appeal against the decision.

She said: ‘I know there are no guarantees that it will work but if I can at least try then that would help me. My future is being played out in the hands of doctors and it’s not fair.’

And she explained how the refusal had put pressure on the couple’s relationship, adding: ‘Matt broke down himself when he came home and I’m depressed with the whole thing.

‘Matt thinks it’s his fault because he has kids and is upset that he can’t give me what I want. But he can’t be blamed.

‘It is very much that I am being punished for being with the man that I love.’

Barbara James, associate chief nurse at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said: ‘We treat each IVF case on an individual basis, but we have to be mindful of the rules surrounding treatment in order to be fair to everyone.’
