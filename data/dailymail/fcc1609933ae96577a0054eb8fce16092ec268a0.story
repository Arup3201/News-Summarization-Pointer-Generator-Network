His grandfather's dashing good looks stole America's heart during his time as President.

Now it seems John F Kennedy's charm has resurfaced - in his only grandson.

Admirers took to the internet to sing the praises of John 'Jack' Schlossberg, 20, who is training to become an emergency medical technician as he studies at Yale University.

As he appeared beside his mother Caroline Kennedy, who was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to Japan, one Twitter user asked: 'When did Caroline Kennedy's son become such a 10?'

One cheekily asked whether he was 'legal' while another said: 'I can't wait to marry into the Kennedy family.'

Despite his comparatively tender age, the young member of one of U.S. politics' greatest dynasties has more than his share of family tragedy.

His uncle John Kennedy Jr died in a plane crash in 1999, and his great-uncle Bobby was assassinated - as, of course, was his grandfather.

Not shaken by his family's past, Jack has been described as a budding statesman. He has already spoken at several prominent events, including the 50th anniversary of New York's JFK Airport.

Statesman in the making: John 'Jack' Schlossberg listens to a speaker on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis last year, at the library in Boston, Massachusetts, which was named for his grandfather

At his age, Jack's grandfather led a 
somewhat more relaxed life - during time off from Harvard aged 20, he 
sailed to France with his convertible car and spent 10 weeks driving 
through Europe.

But the 
future President would soon come of age with the onset of the Second 
World War when he was 22. He served first in the Army then the Navy, 
receiving the Navy and Marine Corps Medal.

His daughter Caroline Kennedy took part
 in a traditional tea ceremony yesterday, just days before flying to 
Japan in her official role as Ambassador.

The
 daughter of President Kennedy was confirmed as the new ambassador by 
the Senate last month and is due to move to Japan with her husband and 
children tomorrow.

The 
55-year-old attorney, who will be the first woman to represent the U.S. 
in the Asian country, was nominated for the vital role by President 
Obama after his re-election.

Respectful: It appears Jack Schlossberg's work as a budding statesman is as admired as his looks

'We just had a tea ceremony which was
 a 
wonderful introduction to the Japanese culture,' Ms Kennedy said at a 
reception in the residence of Japanese ambassador Kenichiro Sasae, which
 was hosted by Secretary of State John Kerry.

'My
 husband and I and my children are so excited to be going to Japan. We 
look forward to meeting as many people as we can, to making new friends,
 visiting and studying the history and culture of this beautiful country
 that is such a strong partner to the United States in so many important
 efforts.'

Ms Kennedy, who has written a best-selling book, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
in September that she would work to 
strengthen the crucial bond with Japan
 on trade, the military and student exchanges.

Japan is the fourth-largest trading partner to the U.S. and home to the Navy's 7th Fleet and 50,000 American troops.

As Mr Kerry introduced the new Japanese ambassador, he told the reception that he first met Ms Kennedy in the 1960s. 

He said the young Ms Kennedy, who had
 been getting ready to ride her pony Macaroni, had burst into tears when
 the pony backed into her.

Mr
 Kerry also noted that the ambassador's grandfather had fought Japanese 
forces when he was a Navy officer in the Second World War.

'The
 daughter of a heroic lieutenant in World War II will be the first 
woman, in the next generation after the war, to represent our country in
 a relationship that symbolizes so much more than just a normal 
diplomatic relationship,' Mr Kerry said.

Tradition: Caroline Kennedy says she is looking forward to learning more about Japanese culture

Family business: President Kennedy follows Jackie and Caroline down the steps of a plane. His daughter will be the third generation of the family to become a diplomat

'This is a symbol of reconciliation, symbol of possibilities, a symbol of people who know how to move past ... look to the future and build a future together.'

He added: 'I am really excited, as the President is, that Caroline is going to be heading over there to represent this relationship at a critical time - with the rebalance to Asia, global marketplace and competition therein, the efforts to deal with North Korea ... challenges of the South China Sea, challenges of climate change.'

When Ms Kennedy was confirmed as the ambassador to Japan it marked the third generation of Kennedys to work as diplomats.

Her grandfather, Joseph, was President Franklin Roosevelt's ambassador to Britain, and her aunt, Jean, was ambassador to Ireland under President Clinton.

Big move: Designer Edwin Schlossberg, right, with Caroline on Tuesday. The family are due to leave for Japan on Thursday

Vital: Ambassador Kennedy speaks to the press on Tuesday. She will be an important link to America's fourth-largest trade partner

The chair of the senior advisory committee at Harvard's Institute of Politics was just coming up to her sixth birthday when her father was assassinated. She has helped raise millions of dollars for New York schools and edited several best-selling books on history, law and poetry.

The mother of three is President of the John F Kennedy Library Foundation and has a BA from Harvard and law degree from Columbia.

Her predecessors include the late Senator 
Mike Mansfield, former Senators Walter Mondale and Howard Baker,  and the 
late House Speaker Tom Foley.

Ms Kennedy, who is married to designer Edwin Schlossberg, replaced John Roos, a wealthy former 
Silicon Valley lawyer.
