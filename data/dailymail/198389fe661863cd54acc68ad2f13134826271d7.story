A new season and with it comes new battles, both on the pitch and in the studios. In much the same way as clubs have fought for talent, the major TV channels have been battling for the best punditry talent.

Alan Hansen’s retirement has left a void at the BBC and Paul Scholes’s arrival is being perceived as a major coup for BT. How will they fare in the shake-up?

Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over the punditry teams that will be discussing the action this season.

Assistant: England assistant manager Gary Neville has been a revelation since joining Sky as a pundit

SKY

Star men: Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness, Jamie Redknapp, Jeff Stelling

Sky still represent the gold standard in punditry, with Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp offering by far the best and most detailed analysis of football. Neville and Carragher, in particular, have formed an excellent and occasionally combative partnership on Monday Night Football – ‘no one grows up wanting to be a Gary Neville’ – and Ed Chamberlin does an excellent job in steering those discussions.

Souness has retained greater punditry authority than just about every other player from his generation, not least because he is willing and able to criticise.

The organisation continue to lead the way in terms of technology, succeeding far more adequately than the rest in explaining how a goal was scored, rather than simply describing what happened. The fact that Sky have made compelling viewing of Jeff Stelling and a group of ex-pros watching TV only supports the notion that they are the most creative and effective at what they do.

Of course they stand on a bigger platform than the rest, but they press home the advantage well, only losing a modicum of credit for their understandable yet irritating over-marketing of the weaker matches.

Rating: 9/10

MNF: Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville are the benchmark for punditry on Monday Night Football

End of an era: Alan Hansen's MOTD career spanned three decades, Alan Shearer will stay on

BBC

Star men: Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Martin Keown, Robbie Savage

The frequent and increasingly popular criticisms of the BBC are harsh, with Match of the Day rightly retaining iconic status in an era of dedicated channels and blanket coverage. But has been left behind by Sky and BT are growing rapidly.

In spite of the challenges it faces in a ballooned market, it still offers a fine service. In Gary Lineker, they have arguably the best anchor of all, while Martin Keown is one of the few former players who can match the Sky group for analysis.

Danny Murphy is also excellent at explaining the game, but overall the BBC lack the dynamism of Carragher and Neville. Perhaps it’s time to lose the chairs.

Alan Shearer continues to get generous allocations for contributions that rarely offer significant insight, though he is improving. And Robbie Savage is more eloquent and sharper than his class clown image.

The BBC have taken strides to freshen the image of its football such as filtering in some new faces like Murphy, who should get more airtime, but still lag some way behind Sky. 

Rating: 8/10

Poor relation: Phil Neville was a commentator and pundit for BBC during the World Cup, it didn't go well

Old and new: Graeme Souness is an old-hand at punditry but Paul Scholes is relatively new on the scene

ITV

Star men: Adrian Chiles, Lee Dixon, Paul Scholes

ITV retain the ultimate love-or-hate anchor in Chiles. To some he is simply unbearable, for reasons largely lost on this reporter. To others, he is recognised as a professional broadcaster from a broadcaster’s background who tries to inject a modicum of humour into the dreadfully serious world of football.

Dixon is a superb analyst and supplements the broadcasts, but Roy Keane’s return to coaching will be a blow, not least because of the absence of his aggression. The will-he, won’t-he saga over the possibility of a punch to Adrian Chiles has now all but disappeared.

Signing Scholes for Champions League matches is also a major coup. Scholes’s open criticisms of Jack Wilshere, Wayne Rooney and Manchester United have stunned viewers of his panel work and readers of his Paddy Power blog.

BT Sport

Star men: Jake Humphrey, Paul Scholes, Jose Mourinho, Rio Ferdinand

Humphrey is an excellent anchor and around him a solid team is starting to develop. Signing Scholes from under Sky’s clutches was a brilliant coup, while Jose Mourinho will do sporadic work and is always box office. 

The Chelsea boss will be able to appear in competitions which Chelsea no longer feature in, which could mean next month’s Community Shield between Arsenal and Manchester City. 

Rio Ferdinand is not to everyone’s  taste, but he speaks from a position of tremendous authority on the current game and is improving.

What excites most is that BT are doing something different, not only in the sense that they offer a wider coverage than the terrestrial channels, but also in their studio gimmicks.

While the BBC have their sofa, BT will get Owen Hargreaves and David James to deliver a free-kick masterclass on their indoor studio pitch. It’s a bit clunky, but early days…
