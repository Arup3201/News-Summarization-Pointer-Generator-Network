Sold: Branston Pickle is being bought by Japanese firm Mizkan for £92.5million

It is a key ingredient of such quintessentially British snacks as the ploughman’s lunch and the cheese and pickle sandwich.

But after 90 years, Branston Pickle has been sold to a Japanese firm.

The £92.5million deal comes just months after the boss of the brand’s parent company, Premier Foods, urged British shoppers to be more patriotic.

Branston is the latest in a long line of traditional brands – including Sarson’s vinegar and Weetabix – to be sold abroad.

Meanwhile, the makers of HP Sauce, who are running a television campaign highlighting its British roots, are under fire for moving production to Holland.

Premier, which acquired Branston in 2002, announced yesterday that it had sold it to Mizkan of Japan.

The deal includes the factory that makes Branston in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, along with the 356-strong workforce.

Branston is popular beyond Britain, with strong sales in the US, Canada, Australia, Norway, Singapore, Germany and Turkey. Despite this, Mizkan, which has a 200-year history in the Japanese food industry, has no plans to sell the pickle in its home market.

'Nationalistic': Mr Clarke called for people to 'buy British' to help protect jobs and farmers in this country back in April

Premier,
which owns other well-known British brands including Hovis, Mr Kipling 
and Oxo, has been under pressure to raise money and pay off large debts.

It sold its Haywards 
pickled onions business and Sarson’s and Dufrais vinegar brands to 
Mizkan in June. But earlier in the year, Premier boss Michael Clarke 
said: ‘We should support British jobs, British supply chains and British
farmers.

‘I’m surprised 
[British] people are not as nationalistic as they could be to protect 
jobs. If you look at our competitors they ship from overseas. That’s 
fine. But I’m going to continue to bang this drum.’

The
company’s director of corporate affairs, Richard Johnson, insisted this
stance was not inconsistent with the decision to sell Branston to a 
Japanese firm, adding: ‘Mizkan is a company that wants to invest in the 
UK, that will keep production in the UK, and therefore jobs in the UK.’

The
Branston sale goes beyond the popular sweet pickle to include relishes,
tomato ketchup, brown sauce, salad cream, and flavoured ‘mayo with a 
twist’.

The Suffolk factory
also makes supermarket own-label pickles and sauces. Kazuhide 
Matazaemon Nakano , chief executive of Mizkan, said: ‘The Branston brand
is an excellent strategic fit with our global portfolio and adds to our
solid foundation for growth in the UK.’

Premier
had set a target of raising £330million from the sale of brands by the 
end of 2014 in order to pay its bank debts, which still remain at a high
£1.27billion. The latest sale means it has met this target ahead of 
schedule.
