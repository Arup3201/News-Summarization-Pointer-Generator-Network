Many wearables record your movements but one firm has developed a range designed to help you track other people.

These include bands that keep tabs on your children, your elderly relatives and your pets.

Each device is controlled via an app where a parent, concerned relative or pet owner can monitor and track its wearer's every move.

A Chinese firm called Haier has developed a range of wearables that help you track other people. Senior bands with a leather strap have GPS technology built in so relatives can keep an eye on elderly people

The range was unveiled by Chinese tech giant Haier at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

Its child and senior bands have GPS technology built-in but while the former is bright and colourful, the latter has a more classic look with a leather strap.

Both are waterproof and are fitted with proximity sensors that feed location to an app where users can monitor the wearable’s movements on a map.

Colourful wearables for children also track their location. They are fitted with proximity sensors that feed a child's location to an app so that parents can see their location on a map

Phone maker Doro has launched a social networking tool for seniors called Connect and Care.

It connects elderly people with relatives and carers and the service can be used to call for help and assistance in an emergency.

Alternatively, the firm said it can also provide help with basic everyday household tasks such as closing a window.

The service is optional and comes with Doro phones, and there is an Android and iOS app for relatives to keep an eye on the user and monitor their movement and communication.

It gives alerts to the family if irregularities are detected – for example loss of movement.

The app will also remind them to call their relative regularly.

Concerned parents and relatives can also use the app to set up safe zones, meaning if a child or elderly relative leaves a dedicated zone, the app will send them an alert.

The app also stores a log of the wearable’s GPS history.

Although many apps and bands track people in a similar way, Haier claims its devices differ because the microphone on each doubles up as a speaker.

Similar to how a baby monitor works, the user can listen to ambient noises around the device to determine their location if there is a problem, for example.

Users of the app can also talk to the wearer through the band.

And for pet owners, Haier has also developed a smart collar that works in a similar way but for cats and dogs.

In the future Haier said it plans to launch an SOS service that can be accessed directly from the band in the case of emergency.

The company didn’t announce prices or availability for the devices.

Haier has also developed a smart collar for dogs. The firm claims  its devices differ from others on the market already because the microphone on each doubles up as a speaker

The Scout5000 (pictured) - a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a dog's health, track their location and even allows owners to speak to their dogs remotely

Doting pet owners will soon be able to get a dog’s-eye-view of the world following the launch of a 'smart collar' for animals.

The Scout5000 - effectively a smartphone for dogs - can monitor a canine's health, track its location and even allows owners to speak to their dog remotely.

The device can also stream videos showing what pets are up to, using a state-of-the-art built-in camera.

The gadget, created by Motorola and video streaming developer Hubble, uses 3G to send alerts to the owner's smartphone, while they are away from their pets.

The downside is that the dog will need a data package for the collar to work, although it does come with ones year's 3G service as part of the £131 ($199) price tag.
