Alex Salmond’s official Christmas card was revealed today, an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who turned up too late to see Jesus.

The Scottish First Minister has opted for the bleak, sinewy painting of Artaban by Scottish artist Peter Howson.

The artwork will be sold to raise money for charity, but some questioned whether its choice for a Christmas card was not very festive.

Festive? This painting of the fourth wise man Artaban by Peter Howson will grace the front of the First Minister Alex Salmond's 2013 charity Christmas card

Since 2007 Mr Salmond has raised £148,000 for charities in Scotland through sales of the original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card.

Today he unveiled the Howson painting, which will be sold at auction in the New Year with the proceeds shared between the Children's Hospice Association Scotland (Chas), CLIC Sargent, Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (Sciaf) and Combat Stress, the charity chosen by the artist.

He insisted the image of Artaban is a ‘hugely appropriate’ work for his card.

Mr Salmond said: ‘The legend of 
Artaban, or the fourth wise man, is based on a novel by Henry van Dyke. 
It tells the tale of a Persian scholar who, delayed by helping the 
vulnerable, follows the star to Bethlehem but arrives just too late to 
herald the birth of the Christ child.

‘Thirty years on in Jerusalem, at Passover, Artaban is still searching.

‘Now
 an old man, he parts with the last of his three gifts to Jesus, a 
sapphire, a ruby and a pearl, to save a young girl from slavery. 
However, in a dying vision, Artaban is comforted that his devotion to 
the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven.

‘The story reminds us that hope, faith and self-sacrifice are at the centre of the order of things.

‘I
 am very grateful to Peter for donating this outstanding painting. As 
you might expect it's a typically powerful image, unmistakeably Howson, 
and I am sure it will go on to make a significant figure for these four 
very good causes at auction next year.’

Reveal: Mr Salmond unveiled the image with its creator today at Malcolm Sargent House in Prestwick

Each charity will be given a series of limited edition prints of the work to help with their fundraising efforts.

The artwork was unveiled today in front of Mr Howson, Mr Salmond and representatives of the charities at an event at Malcolm Sargent House in Prestwick, the holiday home run by CLIC Sargent for young people and their families who are coping with cancer.

Charity: Mr Salmond's card has raised thousands of pounds for charity since 2007

Mr Salmond officially opened the home's playroom earlier this year.

Lucy Caldicott, CLIC Sargent's director of fundraising, said: ‘We are grateful for his support and hope the card will raise money to help children and young people with cancer throughout the festive season.’

Chas and Sciaf say they are honoured to be chosen to benefit from the card.

Andrew Cameron, chief executive of Combat Stress, said: ‘For most of us the realities of war are far removed from our everyday lives.

'It means a great deal for a war artist like Peter Howson, who served in the Royal Highland Fusiliers and bore witness to the horrors of war in Bosnia and Kosovo, to support us.

‘Peter Howson and the First Minister are signalling, in a very personal way, the importance of specialist treatment for veterans suffering psychological wounds from their service.’

The other artists who have taken part in the Christmas card initiative since its launch are John Lowrie Morrison, the late John Bellany, Gerard Burns, Jack Vettriano, Alasdair Gray and Dame Elizabeth Blackadder.
