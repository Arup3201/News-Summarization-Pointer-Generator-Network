25 exotic dancers at a strip club in San Diego are filing a claim against police officers they say forced them to stay at the strip club against their will so they could take revealing pictures of them and their tattoos.

Ten officers on the San Diego police force raided the Cheetah's Gentleman's Club in Kearny Mesa on March 6 to 'check dancers permits' said the dancer's lawyer Dan Gilleon.

The claim says that during the check, 10 officers whose identities were not released, held dancers against their will for an hour without a proper warrant.

The dancers say that the officers told them to pose in different positions so that they could 'photograph their tattoos.'

According to the girls, the officers told them to 'smile for the camera' and made other 'arrogant and demanding' comments that made them feel uncomfortable.

'I got my pictures taken from at least my knees upwards, and I'm half dressed. I felt kind of violated and like my rights were not there,' said dancer Brittany Murphy to NBC.

Officers told the dancers that the photos for their working permits, which are updated on a yearly basis, needed to be renewed.

Lt. Kevin mayer told NBC that the officers didn't do anything against the rules and that photographing dancers and their tattoos, which acts as an identifier, is essential to confirming that dancers are who they say they are.

Lt. Kevin Mayer said that taking photos of dancers and their tattoos is standard protocol when renewing work permits

'The city municipal code mandates that 
the police department go out and conduct these inspections. Now to be an
 adult entertainer or to own a strip club -- those are both police 
regulated businesses, and to be in that profession you have to get a 
permit,' said Mayer to NBC.

'So being that we're mandated to go out and conduct these inspections, the people and the holders of these permits are aware that these [checks] are coming,' he added.

Regardless of what police say, the dancers are filing a civil rights claim against the SDPD for more than $10,000.

The manager for the Cheetah's Rich Buonantony said that the girls felt pressured to do what the cops wanted because if they were to say 'no' to their demands, their work permits could be taken away.

Dan Gilleon told NBC he thinks the claim will be denied in which case he will file a lawsuit.
