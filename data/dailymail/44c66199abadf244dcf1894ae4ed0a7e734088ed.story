If you look hard enough you can find spectacular secluded hotels in all corners of the Earth, whether in inhospitable deserts, hidden in mountains, lodged in the frozen wastes or even under the sea.

For one of the best 'tune in, drop out' experiences travellers should visit a Scottish retreat on the road-free shores of Loch Hourn in the North-West Scottish Highlands

Skiary, described as 'Scotland's Wildest Guesthouse', is a remote traditional stone cottage where the last mile of the journey from Fort William or Inverness must be made by boat or on foot.

Skiary is only reached on foot or by hiring a boat to navigate Loch Hourn and is the last surviving building of an ancient highland  village

The last surviving building of an ancient highland crofting village, Skiary is surrounded only by mountains, sea and sky, with no mobile signal to boot. 

Popular among hill walkers, nature lovers and those wanting a remote hideaway to unplug from modern life, the onus is on a complete break from modern life. 

Don't even think of bringing your laptop – there isn't even electricity here, so goodbye television and all 'modern' distractions.

Paraffin lamps and tea-lights light your way to bed, and there's usually a driftwood fire burning in the hearth.

To get to Three Camel Lodge on the edge of the Gobi desert you might want to forget your usual mode of transport and use a camel instead

Restored in the 1980s by the owner's grandparents and decorated in a charming, old-fashioned style, the wood-lined cottage has just three small bedrooms, sitting room and bathroom, with a Rayburn solid fuel stove used to heat water.

For a sustainably-designed, architecturally stunning hotel in the middle of nowhere, you could do worse than stay at the Fogo Island Inn.

One of the farthest outposts in North America, getting there involves getting a flight to the tiny town of Gander, then it's a one hour and a half drive to the 'Farewell' ferry which takes travellers across Gander Bay to Fogo Island.

A final trip by car 35 minutes from the port takes you to the door of this remote but uber-stylish modern hotel.

Located off Newfoundland's rocky northeast coast, the minimalist wood-and-glass 'inn' has 29 guest suites overlooking islets, rocks and shoals. Most of the rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows facing the North Atlantic, with over reaching views onto rocky islets and their associated wildlife.

Fogo Island is the largest of the offshore islands of Newfoundland, Canada, just off the northeast coast. The island is around 25 km long and 14 km wide and home to a thriving community of arts and crafts.
