She was celebrated as a heroic mother 
who acted in self-defence to protect herself and her children from men 
who broke into her home in Early, Iowa, a decade ago and assaulted her.

But mother-of-three Tracey Roberts now faces jail after a series of revelations over the night when she fired nine shots from two guns into neighbour Dustin Wehde, 20, leaving him dead in her home.

Her murder trial begins 
on Tuesday and questions will be asked over where she is
a manipulator leaving a trail of deceit, who planned the killing and concocted a hoax to let her get 
away with murder.

Murder trial: Tracey Roberts, now 45, left, fired nine shots from two guns into Dustin Wehde, right, in 2001 - a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom

Dustin Wehde was found slumped at the bottom of a bed at Tracey and Michael Roberts’ home in December 2001 in a pool of blood. A bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye socket.

Tracey Roberts was heard screaming in the kitchen with her three children and deputies. Her report that two other intruders escaped sent deputies canvassing everywhere and fear spread in the town.

She claimed that with her husband on a business trip, she was home with her three young children - Bert, Noah and Mason - when Dustin and another man barged through her unlocked door.

Roberts said one of the men choked her 
with panty hose, she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the 
sound of Bert screaming, who was holding a baseball bat to protect his 
younger siblings.

She said she ran to the bedroom and reached for the gun safe, as Dustin tugged at her hair and yanked on her feet. When the safe opened, she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the trigger.

Then she said she grabbed a revolver, spotted Dustin moving and fired at him. He stopped moving and the second man fled. She later said it was only one man, not two, who got away.

An investigation remained open but no second intruder was found and no charges were filed as of late 2002. Then Mr Dustin’s father, Brett Wehde, walked to the grave where his son was buried.

After Dustin was killed, he broke up with
his wife Mona and filed for divorce. Brett was distraught over the 
crumbling of his family. At the graveside, he put a gun to his head and 
pulled the trigger.

Mona wanted answers. She filed a 
wrongful death lawsuit attempting to hold Roberts accountable for 
Dustin's death and to learn what happened that night. She wanted to know
why Roberts killed Dustin.

Her attorney picked up on inconsistencies
in Roberts's story as she retold it. In different accounts, she said 
she fired from different positions. But in the end she dropped the suit 
just days before trial.

'J.P. wants me to get/force his ex T.R. 
to kill her son Burt and then commit suicide, and if that plan fails 
Plan B is to make it appear as though T.R. had committed the murder of 
her son & then committed suicide'

Dustin Wehde's journal entry

This January, Sac County had a new prosecutor in Ben Smith, who went through years of files and months later filed a first-degree murder charge against Roberts, who is now called Tracey Richter.

A key piece of evidence had been found by investigators in Dustin's car. After months of speculation in town, prosecutors revealed this month it was a pink spiral notebook that claimed to be his diary.

In Dustin's handwriting, it suggested he
had been hired as a hit-man by a ‘mysterious fellow’ named John Pitman 
III, who was Tracey's first husband. They split up four years after 
marrying in 1988.

'J.P. wants me to get/force his ex T.R. 
to kill her son Burt and then commit suicide, and if that plan fails 
Plan B is to make it appear as though T.R. had committed the murder of 
her son & then committed suicide,' he wrote.

But investigators never believed it was 
credible. Dustin, a special education student, did not like to write and
he had never met Mr Pitman. They decided to keep the journal's 
existence a secret.

'December 13, 2001, was a nightmare for Tracey. The nightmare is not over'

Defence lawyer Scott Bandstra

Prosecutors suspect she had convinced Dustrin to write the diary, perhaps on the day he died.

DCI Special Agent Trent Vileta took a 
fresh look at his death in 2008 and told Mr Smith the last 
three shots went through the back of Dustin's head while he was face 
down on the ground.

In 1996, Tracey married Australian businessman Michael Roberts before they divorced around eight years later. She tried to pin involvement in the home invasion and Dustin's death on him.

But for all the complexity swirling around his client, defence lawyer Scott Bandstra said her self-defence case in the murder trial will actually be simple for jurors to understand.

Mr Bandstra added: ‘December 13, 2001, was a nightmare for Tracey. The nightmare is not over.’ Now aged 45 and facing life in prison if convicted, she is being held on $1million bail.
