You've been with your boyfriend a year. You think he's pretty swell. He asks you to move in with him. You say 'sure, what the heck'. But you're not totally convinced he's the one... so what do you do with all the duplicate belongings you'll now have? The toasters, the teapots, the wine racks, the hoovers?

Do you sell them? Do you store them in the attic and risk a tiff about your commitment to the relationship? Or do you squirrel them away in secret, ready to collect when the inevitable happens and you go your separate ways?

Now there's an easy way to do just that, thanks to a British storage facility offering a 'break-up protection service' for newly cohabiting couples.

Don't think he's The One? Use Lovespace's clandestine storage facility to stash away your duplicate possessions so you can reclaim them if you do break up

Storage-by-the-box provider Lovespace will secretly store duplicate items for uncertain cohabiters who might wish to keep hold of the second washing machine and spare set of tea cosies, should the relationship fail.

Since 29 per cent of UK households consist of only one person, when two people decide to live together they often have two of everything, such as kettles, toasters, linen, crockery and other personal effects that there isn't space for in their new house.

Cohabiting couples are twice as likely to break up as married partners, according to research, so if throw away all of your household and personal items before moving in, you could be left with an expensive shopping trip to re-establish your independence if you do break up.

Steve Folwell, managing director of Lovespace, said: 'We wanted to help the biggest commitment-phobes move in with their partners.

'Openly keeping hold of things that you identify with your single life isn't exactly a recipe for happily ever after, so we decided to offer apprehensive cohabiters a secret service where they can keep a box of their past life.'

Doubled-up: Since 29 per cent of UK households consist of only one person, when two people decide to live together they often have two of everything

Lovespace is trialling the service initially and will gauge customer reaction before rolling out permanently.

For a limited period on a first-come, first-served basis, LOVESPACE is offering the Secret Storage Service free for a whole year.
