A 14-year-old stabbed a fellow pupil in the back with a kitchen knife after hearing voices in his head and watching documentaries about American school massacres, a court heard.

The teenager attacked the boy without warning or provocation at his school and then mentioned to police the gun killings at Columbine and Virginia Tech.

The boy said he had heard voices telling him to 'hurt people', Plymouth Crown Court in Devon heard.

The teenager also told police he was going to 'seek out' students who had bullied him.

But he handed over the knife and burst into tears after stabbing the first pupil - who was never involved in any bullying.

The boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was hearing voices telling him to 'hurt people', Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) heard

A judge passed a hospital order which means the boy will be held at a medium-security psychiatric unit until doctors determine he is safe for release.

The court heard he had been diagnosed with a treatable mental disorder in atypical autism.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to maliciously wounding the 15-year-old on December 9 last year.

Kelly Scrivener, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said that the boy stabbed his victim in the back as he waited in class for school to start.

He needed six stitches to a two-inch deep wound between his shoulder blades.

Miss Scrivener said the attack was witnessed by five students, all aged between 11 and 15, who became 'extremely distressed'.

She added the boy ran from the room before handing over the knife in reception and collapsing in tears.

Miss Scrivener added: 'He explained to the school staff and then to police that he brought the knife from home and made reference to two American schools where pupils had committed violent offences, in fact murders, against other students.'

She said that later in interview he said he had become interested in documentaries on school massacres at Columbine and Virginia Tech.

Miss Scrivener added: 'Before the stabbing, he watched documentaries, then he formed a plan to go to school the next day.

'He was asked by police why he could not go "through with it" and he said he became so distressed that he could not go on.'

She added that he reported hearing voices 'ordering him to hurt people' but he had not formally reported the problem.

Miss Scrivener said he and his family had complained to the school about bullying, though he said he hardly knew the victim, whom he described as 'nice'.

The 14-year-old also told police he had watched films about the Virginia Tech Massacre (pictured), in which 32 people were killed and another 17 injured by a lone gunman on campus

The court heard that police found there was no wider knife culture at the school, which cannot be identified for legal reasons.

David Evans, for the defendant, said he had been diagnosed with 'atypical autism'.

He added he was supported by his family and had been at a medium secure psychiatric unit since December.

Mr Evans said the family had been concerned about bullying 'for some time'.

The court heard he had made good progress since then.

Judge Paul Darlow passed a hospital order under the Mental Health Act, which means the boy will be detained for treatment for an unspecified time until he is deemed safe for release.

The teenager, who appeared over a videolink from a court in Birmingham, had denied an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a kitchen knife on school premises.

The pleas were accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service.

A student at Virginia tech shot dead 32 people and injured 17 others in April, 2007. Two students at Columbine High School in Colorado murdered 12 colleagues and one teacher, and injured a further 21 people, in 1999.

Columbine High School Massacre, April 20, 1999: 15 dead, 24 injured

On the morning of Tuesday, April 20 in 1999 two students from Columbine High School, in Colorado, carried out a spree shooting in which they shot dead 15 people and injured another 21.

The highly organised attack was carried out by senior students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. The two, armed with an arsenal of guns and explosives, stalked the school campus firing indiscriminately at teachers and students.

The shooting lasted just under one hour. Although police had responded, the two shooters are thought to have committed suicide simultaneously by shooting themselves.

Because the two killed themselves there remained a wide range of speculation about their motivation.

The killers' interests of music and video games was scrutinised, as were concerns the two had been victims of bullies and were suffering from mental health issues.

It also sparked an intense public debate on the issue of gun control in the U.S. with campaigners calling for stronger gun control measures.

The crime has become one of the most notorious shootings in modern U.S. history. At the time it was considered one of the country's worst in terms of total death toll - but this has been surpassed by more heinous shootings in recent years.

It was also the subject of a 2002 Michael Moore documentary - in which the director explored the context of the massacre with regards to U.S. gun control laws and violence in society.

This incident remains one of the worst shooting atrocities ever committed in the U.S.

In this case, lone gunman Seung-Hui Cho, 23, carried out two attacks at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in which he killed 32 people then turned the gun on himself.

Cho first killed several students in a hall of residence. He then stopped for almost two hours before returning to the campus' engineering hall where the majority of killings took place after he chained the doors shut.

Like the Columbine massacre, the killer - armed with firearms - shot dozens of students and staff in a two-hour period.

And like Columbine, the shooting re-ignited widespread debate, and heavy criticism, of U.S. gun laws. Many gun advocates suggested laws should be relaxed to allow gun owners to carry weapons more freely - the idea being a member of the public could stop a potential shooter.

Others called for a tightening of gun buying restrictions, saying it was far too easy for an individual to get access to powerful weapons.

Following the incident, Cho was found to have been suffering from severe mental health and social issues - including severe anxiety and depression.
