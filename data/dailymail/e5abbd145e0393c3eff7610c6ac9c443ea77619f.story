A woman who was bullied at school and only had ferrets for friends has had the last laugh after launching a successful modelling career.

Sophie Roper, 20, took her pet animals on long walks in the hills whenever she was feeling lonely during her teenage years.

She said she had been bullied relentlessly during her formative years but that her four beloved pet ferrets had always kept her good company.

Sophie Roper, from Roseneath, Scotland, was bullied at school and only had ferrets for friends. But now, the budding catwalk queen has launched a successful modelling career

It all started when her family moved to Scotland from Southend, Essex, at the age of 13 and she struggled to fit in with the girls at her new school.

Ferrets Sasha, Sunny, Mr Blister, and Baby, helped Sophie through the hard years when she found it difficult to make firm friends and boosted her confidence. 

And now, the wannabe Victoria's Secret Angel hopes to take first prize at the Top Model UK competition in March and bag a place on the catwalk at London Fashion Week.

Speaking about her difficult school years, Sophie, from Rosneath, Argyll and Bute, said: 'I had a lot of trouble trying to fit in with different friendship groups.

'A lot of the time I would be deceived into thinking they were my friend but I was just being used as a prop in their schemes.'

She continued: 'I would get a lot of grief for trying to get along with people and would get slagged off a lot for what I was wearing because I didn't care at the time. I'd get used and spoken down to.

'I still have trust issues today because of the way I was treated. I would always try to help people not expecting anything in return but hoping for it.'

Explaining how she became so close to her furry pets, Sophie said: 'The ferrets were my excuse to leave the house and not seem as alone as I was. I took them for quite long walks in the hills near my home.

'It might sound sad but they were my friends. For a long time, along with my sister, they were the only friends that I had.

'The ferrets wouldn't judge me and were always there for me when I had a bad day. They were a big responsibility.

'At school, I couldn't bring the ferrets with me so I always felt lonelier than usual. I would wander the corridors on my own or chat to teachers just to look as though I was busy.

'I was very shy and quiet at school. I would keep to myself but sometimes just break out in tears. I would always be embarrassed to be seen alone.'

When she was 15, Sophie entered her first pageant and finished in fourth place at Miss Caledonia Scotland

The ferrets sadly died two years ago, but at that point Sophie had managed to make some human friends who encouraged her as she entered her first pageants.

Her first foray into pageantry came when she was 15 when she finished in fourth place at Miss Caledonia Scotland.

Speaking about her success, Sophie said: 'That was my first pageant and I managed to finish fourth out of everyone in Scotland. I've stuck at it since then. For now, the sky is the limit.

'My family have always been really close and encouraging. That helped me to get over my problems.

'Gradually I managed to find some friends who weren't ferrets and they have encouraged me to get out of my shell a bit.' 

Explaining how she became so close to her furry pets, Sophie said: 'The ferrets were my excuse to leave the house and not seem as alone as I was. I took them for quite long walks in the hills near my home'

Sophie says her family have always been 'really close and encouraging', which helped her through the tough school years she endured 

And now, the fledgling model has grand plans for the future and hopes her appearance at the Top Model UK competition will lead to great things. 

'I am obsessed with the Victoria's Secret Angels,' she said. 'It's my dream to become one of them - though I might be about 84 by the time I manage it.

'I've even managed to swear off of chocolate, crisps and everything bad to give me the best chance of winning.' 

Ferrets Sasha, Sunny, Mr Blister, and Baby, who died two years ago, helped Sophie overcome her shyness
