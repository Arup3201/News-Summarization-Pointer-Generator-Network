A woman has given birth to a boy weighing an astonishing 13.8lbs in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.

According to the hospital, the baby was delivered ten days before his mother was due to give birth to him.

He is potentially the heaviest premature baby in China, however he is not the heaviest newborn overall, and does not even hold the record for 2014.

Last month one woman gave birth to a 16lbs boy in Shanwei, southeast China, and the national record holder before that weighed ‘only’ 15.5lbs.

An estimated 6.9 per cent of babies in China are born 'oversized', thought to be a result of rising obesity rates and poor diets in mothers.

Big boy: This newborn baby weighed a whopping 13.8lbs - 5.9kg - when he entered the world

Making it big: According to the hospital in  Changchun, Jilin Province, China,  the baby was delivered ten days before the mother's due date

Go big or go home: This baby is nearly twice the size of a normal child at the time of birth, despite being more than a week premature

Almost there: Although the boy may be the biggest premature baby born in China, a 16lbs boy was born earlier this year, still holding on to the record
