An Australian surfer has experienced first-hand the unforgiving swells at Cronulla when she smashed into a rock pool several times.

A video has captured the terrifying moment world number two Tyler Wright was unable to escape the relentless surf after her board washed over the rocks, through the chain fence and into the pool.

Wright was on her way back to the shore in the three- to four-foot swell with a rough shore break when she went left at Alley Reef - in Sydney's south - and came off.

On Saturday, Wright was participating in the Australian Boardriders Battle National Final

The 20-year-old was heading back to shore when she turned left at Alley Reef and she fell off her board

She attempted to get her board back twice but the waves would not let up, and was forced to jump off the pool wall and back into the ocean as the board continued to wash back into the pool again, with Wright still attached by her leg rope. 

Concerned fans, along with her brother Owen Wright, watched as the 20-year-old battled the tough conditions during Saturday's Australian Boardriders Battle National Final.

Fortunately, Wright was able to free herself from the board and made her way back to the beach.

She was first greeted by her brother who hugged her as the relieved surfer appeared to have been left unscathed by the incident.

The board then headed into the rock pool where it became stuck as waves continued to hammer the 20-year-old

She attempted two times to get her board back but had to abort both times when conditions made it impossible for her to do so

Eventually, she was able to free herself from the board by detaching herself from the leg rope

She luckily escaped uninjured but was taken to hospital in an ambulance for precautionary checks

But as a precaution, Wright was seen being packed into an ambulance on a stretcher and taken to hospital for precautionary checks.

At the time, Wright was in a stable condition, according to a statement from the World Surf League.

The 20-year-old surfer is part of the Culburra Boardriders team from southern New South Wales.

The Australian Boardriders Battle National Final continues tomorrow, with $120,000 up for grabs for the winner.

Her brother Owen Wright, who is also a surfer, along with concerned fans watched from the shore

He was the first to comfort her sister after the scary incident, which saw her walk away shaken but seemingly unscathed

Here she is seen being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher and was taken to hospital
