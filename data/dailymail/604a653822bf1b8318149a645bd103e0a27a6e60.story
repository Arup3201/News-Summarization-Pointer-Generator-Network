A doctor who sent a toddler home from hospital three days before he died from dehydration 'failed to properly examine the youngster', a tribunal has heard. 

Dr Tasnim Arif should have used more caution in dealing with Harry Connolly at Northampton General Hospital, an expert claimed.

Harry was suffering from lethargy, vomiting and diarrhoea when he was admitted on April 28, 2011.

Dr Arif, a paediatric registrar, told concerned mother Lucy that they should go home after deciding the boy was not dehydrated.

Three days later Harry’s father Raymond found his son dead in his cot.

A post-mortem concluded he had died of dehydration and kidney failure.

Expert Dr Dipak Kanabar, a consultant at Evelina London Children’s Hospital, said: ‘Although Dr Arif has made some assessment of hydration status, in my opinion it is an inadequate one.’

He said Dr Arif should have carried out blood tests and explained that a longer period of hospital assessment was required.

Dr Kanabar said it is possible Harry’s condition could have been managed differently had blood tests been taken on time.

‘A greater degree of caution needed to be applied in this case,’ he added.

Mrs Connolly has said she found the doctor ‘difficult, cold, hard-hearted and uninterested’ when she asked her to find out what was wrong with her baby.

The tribunal has heard that Harry fell ill on April 23 and was referred to hospital by the family GP on April 26.

The boy was examined by paediatrician Dr Farhana Shamim, who said he was not dehydrated, and discharged the following morning by Dr Ayevbekpen Omorgie.

At around 3.30pm on April 28 Harry was brought back to hospital by his mother, after his parents felt he was not getting any better and seen by Dr Arif.

Dr Arif discharged Harry at around 5.45pm on the afternoon of April 28, telling his mother that he was not dehydrated.

The next day grandmother Val Faulkner rang the hospital but was told by a nurse they should take the toddler to their GP or accident and emergency if his condition was deteriorating.

After phoning the GP out-of-hours service, the family spoke to Dr Mary McCracken who said they should bring him in to the out-of-hours service as he may be suffering from dehydration.

At the out of hours service, Harry was examined by Dr Aboo Thamby who assessed that he was not dehydrated and did not need to be readmitted to NGH.

By April 30 Harry’s parents reported that he was ‘brighter’ but his fingers and toes were very cold.He was found dead by his father early the next morning.

Dr Arif is accused of professional misconduct for treatment that fell ‘seriously below’ the expected standard.

It is alleged that the doctor failed to fully record that Harry was still passing blood in his stool, that he had not eaten for five days or that he was lethargic.

Dr Arif has admitted that she failed to record how often Harry was passing stool and vomiting and did not ask for further clarity on the subject.

The medic also admitted to not comparing his current weight to his weight when he was previously discharged on April 27.

However, she denies failing to adequately assess or record a number of clinical features when assessing the baby’s hydration status, including the overall summary of ‘well hydrated’ or ‘not well hydrated’.

Dr Arif also denies failing to arrange a longer assessment period, not arranging the duty consultant to review Harry’s clinical status and failing to arrange for blood tests, as the consultant had asked.

At an inquest in 2012 Coroner Anne Pember catalogued a series of ‘failings’ by doctors and nurses at the hospital and a GP’s out-of-hours service. 

The hospital made a formal apology to the family following the coroner’s findings.

The hearing continues.
