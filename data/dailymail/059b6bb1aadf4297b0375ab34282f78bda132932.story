Prince Andrew has revealed he remained friends with Sarah Ferguson after their divorce 'more for family than anything else'.

The royal spoke about the couple's split and continued friendship in a candid interview with US satellite TV channel CNBC.

The couple married in 1986 but separated in 1992 and divorced four years later. But they have remained on good terms and have brought up their daughters, Princesses Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24, together.

The couple, pictured at daughter Beatrice's graduation in 2011, have called themselves 'the world's happiest unmarried couple'

In his latest interview, to be screened in the US this week, the 54-year-old said of their relationship: 'It's just part of life's rich tapestry if you have been married to somebody,' the Sunday Times reported.

He added: 'I just see it as illogical not to be a friend at the end of the day, regardless of what your circumstances are.'

The Duke and Duchess of York have made no secret of their amicability since their split and are said to describe themselves as 'the world's happiest unmarried couple'.

The Duchess, 54, who still lives at the Duke of York's home in Windsor, even visited the Queen's estate in Balmoral, Scotland for a break earlier this summer.

It is believed the Duke's TV interview is a bid to improve his image worldwide after his acquaintance with convicted American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Andrew reportedly said of the scandal that he accepted he had to 'live with the rough and live with the smooth' in a 'free world, with freedom of speech'.

He also used the interview to promote his iDEA scheme, which aims to improve young people's computer and digital skills to help them get a job.

The technology-loving Duke is promoting the scheme with pop star Will.i.am and the pair are said to 'compare smartphones' when they meet up.

But Will.i.am's phone caused embarrassment in a recent interview about the scheme, when it went off as the pair were answering questions on live TV.

After the incident, the Prince told the Black Eyed Peas frontman: 'I leave my digital devices in the car when I am doing engagements - based on the fact that they might accidentally go off.'

Talking about the scheme in his latest interview, Andrew said: 'I believe that the next generation are as capable and have greater opportunities than our generation ever had.

'So it's about making those possibilities more relevant and more alive to young people today.'
