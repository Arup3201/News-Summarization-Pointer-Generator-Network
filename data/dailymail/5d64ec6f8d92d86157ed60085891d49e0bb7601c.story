Levante manager Lucas Alcaraz has played down any talk of his side causing an upset at the Bernabeu on Sunday.

Despite Real Madrid's poor run of form, which has seen the fans turn on some of the players and the management, Alcaraz knows that on their day they are more than capable of beating his side.

Speaking to Levante's official website, Alcaraz explained it would need an excellent team effort.

He said: 'The players have to play as a team, being able to have order when we have the ball and not suffer losses.

'The potential of Madrid is always high.'

A 2-1 over Eibar lifted Levante out of relegation trouble, but the manager does not think it will mean much come Sunday.

'Clearly we won the last game, but there is a vast difference between the potential of Madrid and ours,' he said.

Madrid president Florentino Perez was forced to come out in support of his manager this week, declaring 'Ancelotti will continue'.

A patchy run of form has seen them drop to second in the table, but it was arguably the 4-3 defeat to Schalke on Tuesday night which was the more damaging to the atmosphere around the club.

Despite the uncertainty, Sergio Ramos brushed off the concerns, telling Marca: 'If there's one thing that defines our camp it's joy, in every 'rondo' [piggy-in-the-middle passing drill] and exercise we do.

'First and foremost you have to be happy and have fun, and we have a terrific atmosphere in the dressing room.'

Ramos is expected to return to the side after injury, but Toni Kroos is expected to be rested in preparation for next week's crucial clash with Barcelona.

That means midfielders Lucas Silva and Luka Modric are likely to be recalled to the side, the latter after making his comeback from a serious thigh injury in the Champions League defeat.

Daniel Carvajal could also be welcomed back after returning to training with the rest of the squad, but despite a step-up in his rehab, James Rodriguez is not yet ready to return to action.
