Kim Kardashian planted herself firmly on the fashion map with her second Vogue cover this week.

Sashaying along a beach with her  trademark long dark tresses and smouldering stare, Kim was also rocking another signature look - an all-white outfit.

The 34-year-old loves the cleanest of colours and whether it's a plunging gown, power suit or that famous post-baby selfie, there's only one colour Kim will choose.

'My February cover with Australian Vogue': Kim Kardashian  tweeted her  first solo Vogue cover this weekend

Kim wore a full white suit complete with  shoes while in Prague last May, and a pristine dress in 2012

She's rocked backless white frocks, high necked white dresses and even white swimsuits. But what is the inspiration behind her pure new look?

Her rapper husband has taken a strong interest in his now-wife's look and since the pair became an item in 2012 has been open about her direction of her fashion choices.

Kim's look is certainly sleeker and more stylish. Gone are the tight, brightly coloured frocks  and in their place are neutral tones and sharp tailoring.

And this certainly seems to be influenced by her rapper husband as  Kanye is said to be a fan of this more paired-back look.

It was even once reported that he would only allow baby daughter North to dress in neutral colours, with typical baby pink off the menu.

Kim is happy to admit that when it comes to fashion he is a big influence. She once said: 'Kanye and I always talk about my yellow jacket moment.

'There was this one time in Miami when I wore this yellow suede jacket and it was like tighter here and the sleeves got big, it was cropped. 

'It was an over-sized jacket, it would have looked really cute on someone who was tall. It wasn't for my body type. We always say, 'This can't be a yellow jacket moment!' 

Kim is famed for wearing high waisted skirts and crop tops and has even worn them in white

Kim rocked this snakeskin white look in 2012, again matching her look with a pair of black heels 

And she recently tweeted that the couple had been, 'up all night,' redoing her wardrobe promising a 'new 2015 vision'.

It's not the first time either. In 2012 he was seen going through he closet on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, getting rid of hundreds of items.  

Furthermore Kim previously revealed that when it comes to fashion the most important thing to her is making sure Kanye likes her outfit.

She said: 'You want your guy to think you're really hot. I'll put something on and he'll [Kanye] say, 'No, that doesn't look good', and I'll trust him.'

Kim also revealed that after having North she was even more compelled to wear paler coloured clothing: 'I want to dress a little lighter colourwise.

'I think North looks cute in light colours, and then I want to wear light colours. North doesn't typically wear pink, though. 

'She wears mauve or blush, not, like, typical baby pink.'
