A pair of Russian multi-millionaires apparently went head to head to see who could splash the most cash in a top Mayfair bar - ending up with a combined bar bill of more than £130,000.

Owners of Kitsch London claim the mystery pair spent a small fortune trying to outdo each other in just three hours on the club's opening night.

According to onlookers, two arch rivals, in their 30s, racked up a bar bill that would buy a one-bed flat in the capital in just a few hours - and didn't even drink it all.

Head to head: The unidentified Russians tried to outdo each other with more and more extravagant orders. The first man (left) racked up more than £20,000 on Dom Perignon alone as well as ordering cocktails. The second man managed to win the 'challenge' however, by ordering more than £40,000 of Cristal

The men arrived just before midnight and started ordering large numbers of Dom Perignon and Cristal champagne.

Every time one table would order a set of drinks the other man would add more on his next order to beat the other.

By the end of the night, the bills were an eye-watering £66,778.91 and £64, 279.70 - making a grand total of £131,058.61.

The first man's bill for £66,778.91 included 30 Magnums of Cristal, 20 Bottles of Dom Perignon, 20 Crack Baby shots, six Espresso Martinis, 10 shots of 18-year-old Glenmorangie whiskey, eight bottles of mineral water, seven bottles of 1998 vintage Krug champagne and two magnums of Belvedere vodka.

The other bill for £64,279.70 included 64 bottles of Dom Perignon at £325 each which came to £20,800 on its own. There was also 25 bottles of Crystal champagne, 16 of Armand de Brignac Ace of Spades champagne, 12 bottles of Dom Perignon Rose, 7 Mohitos, 10 bottles of Peroni, 20 cans of Red Bull, six Bellinis, six bottles of water, two bottle of Chivas 18-year-old whiskey, six bottles of Krug Grande Cuvee, and eight bottles of Belle Epoque Rose.

Revellers: Clubbers at Kitsch were treated to entertainment from burlesque dancers and circus performers

The bar was shut just before 3am and when the totals were added up the table that had won by just short of £2,500 were reportedly jumping up and down ecstatically waving their bill in the air.

One onlooker at the club said: 'It was one of the most bizarre nights I’ve ever seen.

'These two guys were competing with each other to buy more and more champagne each time one would buy five bottles the other would order six, then seven, then eight.

'I’ve seen stuff like this once before in St Tropez where there’s a bottle war but never like this in London before.

'Every time a set of bottles of champagne would come out they would be carried by waitresses wearing next to nothing and there with sparklers everywhere.

'There were so many bottles and sparklers is was as bright as a summers day at some points of the night.'

Risque: Burlesque performers danced at the club opening where the incredible bill was racked up.

Decadent: Animal-themed performers and burlesque dancers entertained the crowds

Owners: Hip hop promoter Serg Ivo (left) and club owner Mark Fuller(right). An onlooker called the spending spree 'bizarre'. The bills included 84 bottles of Dom Perignon

He added: 'There was a massive crowd of stunning women around each table in no time at all, and frankly these guys needed some help drinking all this booze anyway.

'At the end of the night there was loads of full bottles left, there’s simply no way they could have drunk it all.'

Owners Mark Fuller and Serg Ivo, who is on the new Fox TV show Meet The Russians, launched the club last week and the owners say their clientele already includes several Russian billionaires.

The venue has had a £500,000 refit and entertainment includes burlesque dancers and circus performers.

The world's largest superyacht Azzam. The £400 million vessel measures a staggering 590ft

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's vessel Eclipse was the world's biggest yacht until earlier this year, when he was usurped by Azzam, a £390million craft owned by the Emirati royal family.

It is longer than 12 double-decker buses, requires a staff of 50, and interior features include a 29ft salon and a stunning, open-plan interior.

Eclipse, valued at £740million, features an armour-plated master suite, two swimming pools, two helipads, a hall, a cinema, a mini-submarine and even its own missile defence system.

The size of superyachts has grown as billionaires compete to own the largest and its builders boast that Azzam, which means dedication in Arabic, is the 'most complex and challenging yacht that has ever been built'.

It was designed by Nauta Yachts and constructed in Bremen by Lurssen - she was floated out in April.

The firm's Peter Lurssen said: 'She truly represents another milestone in yachting history.'
