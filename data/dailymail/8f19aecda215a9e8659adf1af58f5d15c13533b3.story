An annual measurement of the United States' overall health has shown that Americans made a 'notable shift' towards better health in 2013.

America's Health Rankings is an annual assessment of the country's health on a state-by-state basis by the United Health Foundation.

This year's rankings show that in 2013, Americans exercised more, smoked less and, for the first time since 1998, obesity rates did not increase.

Overall rankings: Hawaii was the healthiest U.S. state, followed by Vermont

Overall, Hawaii was the most healthy state in the country, while Mississippi ranked lowest for health. Last year, Vermont topped the list for healthiest state, and came in second this year.

To understand the health of communities across the country, various factors were measured, including smoking, obesity, air pollution, high school graduation rates, infant mortality and crime rates.

The analysis uses data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Medical Association, Census Bureau, Department of Education and the FBI to gather information on behaviors, community and environment, policy and clinical care.

Physical inactivity: A map of the country shows the proportion of adults who engaged in no physical activity

'We are encouraged,' Reed Tuckson, senior medical adviser to the United Health Foundation, told USA Today.

'Put all together, the big conclusion is that these trends give us reason to be empowered to do more. We're seeing it all across America — individuals and families are making the decision to be active, to eat a more appropriate diet, to stop smoking. We are seeing that people can do it. And we are encouraged by the work in communities to address these issues that compromise America's health and vitality. Now we have to do more of it.

'We are in no way declaring the war is over but are declaring that there is reason for optimism,' he says.

Obesity rates: For the first time since 1998, the national obesity rate did not increase

While there were significant improvements in smoking rates (down from 21.2 per cent in 2012 to 19.6 per cent), binge drinking, physical inactivity and premature death (death before 75 years of age), the report notes that there are still many challenges to national health.

Diabetes rates have increased to almost double what they were in the mid-1990s and now the chronic disease affects 9.7 per cent of adults

Also on the rise is chlamydia, the prevalence of which which has increased 8 per cent since 2012.

Other
 challenges noted by the report are children living in poverty, with 
21.3 per cent of people under 18 living below the poverty line.

Improvement: Smoking rates have decreased nationally since last year

The lack of health insurance is another challenge, with 15.6 per cent of the population living uninsured.

The
 president of the Institute of Medicine Harvey V. Fineberg says that the
 U.S. has a long way to go before national health is on a par with other
 developed countries.

He notes that dozens of countries have longer life expectancies and lower infant mortality rates than the U.S.

'At
 the same time, America spends double the per capita average of other 
wealthy nations on health care. In fact, if America’s health 
expenditures of $2.8 trillion were the entire gross domestic product 
(GDP) of a nation, it would rank fifth among the world’s largest 
economies. America’s health system is neither successful nor 
sustainable,' he writes.
