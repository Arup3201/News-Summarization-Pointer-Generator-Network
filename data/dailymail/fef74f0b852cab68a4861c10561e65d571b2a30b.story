A former Morgan Stanley executive was caught on tape admitting he filmed sex acts with three women for his own enjoyment, a report claims.

John C Kelly, 32, has denied unlawful surveillance, claiming the cameras were simply there to monitor his puggle.

But his defense could take a blow as one of his victims is said to have recorded the moment she confronted the financier.

Confession? John C Kelly denied secretly filming three women perform sex acts and claimed he was monitoring his puggle Maddy (pictured). But one of his victims allegedly recorded his confession

The recording watched by the New York Post hears Kelly allegedly stammer: 'I'm not innocent, I've said exactly what I've done.

'I lied about having sex with someone else and I videotaped it for my own watching enjoyment. Which is weird but...'

His 37-year-old victim, an Ivy League graduate, hits back: 'I didn't know that you were filming it and I trusted you'.

Emotional, Kelly continues to take the blame: 'It was once. And I had totally forgotten about it. Like I never had watched it.'

The woman, who is Indian, then calls on Kelly to explain why the video was titled 'India Research'.

After imploring him to apologize, she is then shouted down with the words: 'Big f–king deal. I never showed anyone.'

The confrontation is said to have come before Kelly was arrested at his Manhattan apartment last November - around the time he was fired by Morgan Stanley for writing bad checks.

He was accused by prosecutors of recording sex acts with three women dozens of times between May 2011 and December 2012,  charged with unlawful surveillance and attempted unlawful surveillance to which he pleads guilty.

But Kelly blamed his dog for the videos - claiming he had set up cameras in his Manhattan apartment to keep an eye on his pooch, but the device accidentally caught his sexual escapades.

'It’s on and sometimes stays on. So I accidentally recorded myself having sex because it’s always recording,' police say Kelly told them February 26, 2013.

Kelly, son of civil attorney John Q Kelly, also allegedly recorded the women at their own apartments, setting up his open laptop facing the bed and claiming he needed the computer to respond to work emails, the New York Post reported in June.

A lawyer for one of the victims says he uploaded at least some of the videos to video sharing sites YouTube and Vimeo.  

Attorney Daniel Parker, who represents one of the women at the center of the case, argues the X-rated recordings were made using such a sophisticated surveillance system featuring a hidden camera, a webcam and a phone application that it could not have been an accident.

Victims ‘did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images,’ prosecutors stated in his arraignment.

The breasts, buttocks and vagina of one of the victims could be clearly seen in the video, officials said. 

The case has been adjourned until December 11.
