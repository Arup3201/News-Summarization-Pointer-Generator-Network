As 'The Chosen One' banner appears amid a darkened, stormy sky, a Scottish voice sounds, 'Football, bloody hell. What the hell was that all about?'.

A woman then has her say, 'I was ashamed of them'. The on-screen text is equally damning, 'Following a season of discontent' it reads.

The banner, wearing the face of David Moyes, crumples to the backdrop of thunder and lightening.

This, however, is no fan-site illustration or rival taunt – this is MUTV, Manchester United's in-house television station.

The trailer continues.

'Trust me, we'll be back,' a foreign voice adds as the United players emerge from the clouds with the message 'A new storm is breaking'.

Ryan Giggs then has his say, 'Keep supporting us and the good times will come back soon'.

While the statues of Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson stand guard, Giggs and new boss Louis van Gaal are cast in the troubled sky, 'The Master & Apprentice'.

The neon, red lettering of 'Manchester United' breaks through the gloom, 'Start to rebuild a dynasty'.

The message is clear: Moyes brought down the empire, Van Gaal and Giggs will rebuild it.

MUTV makes no attempt to mask its appraisal of Moyes' efforts last season, the use of the word 'ashamed' proving particularly barbed.

Having succeeded Ferguson – whose decision it was to appoint his compatriot – the Scot led the champions to a sorry seventh in the Premier League, missing out on Champions League football for the first time since 1995.

Each passing week saw the collection of another unwanted record; it was United's worst season since the birth of the Premier League in 1992.

Moyes paid with his job before the end of the campaign and Holland boss Van Gaal was appointed.

MUTV are evidently keen to get behind the new regime and the trailer is a bold production given its setting on an in-house station.

But in an age where we criticise clubs for the propaganda-like offerings from their official websites and TV channels, MUTV should at least be applauded for refusing to ignore their disastrous last campaign.

We're not too sure David Moyes will agree with that sentiment, however.
