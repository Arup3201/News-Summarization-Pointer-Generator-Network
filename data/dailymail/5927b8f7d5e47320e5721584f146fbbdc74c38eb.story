Capt. Mark Vanacore, a spokesman for the Phoenix Fire Department, told The Arizona Republic only that the woman had 'some sort of medical event.'

The flight was on a Boeing 757 aircraft, according to US Airways.

In-flight deaths are rare but several are reported on commercial airline flights each year.

It's not clear whether the woman was travelling alone or with a companion, or if she was Hawaiian or travelling home to Phoenix.
