The U.S. Air Force is preparing to send its super-secret spy plane into orbit for a third time, but details of the mission will once again be kept under wraps.

The X-37B, an unmanned and reusable spacecraft built by Boeing, will launch sometime in October.

Next month’s blast-off will reportedly test the X-37B’s reusability, it’s instruments and just how feasible it is for future missions.

Space plane: The X-37B, an unmanned and reusable spacecraft built by Boeing, will launch sometime in October

Major Tracy Bunko at the Pentagon’s Air Force press desk, told Space.com: 'One of the most promising aspects of the X-37B is it enables us to examine a payload system or technology in the environment in which it will perform its mission and inspect them when we bring them back to Earth.'

'Returning an experiment via the X-37B OTV enables detailed inspection and significantly better learning than can be achieved by remote telemetry alone.'

While the launch is slated for October, the exact date is not yet set in stone, according to Space.com.

Major Bunko told the site: 'We are on track to launch OTV-3 next month; however, the exact date remains subject to change based on range conditions, weather, etc.'

While the X-37B landed at Vendenberg Air Force Base in California, the military is looking into the possibility of landing the vessel at Kennedy Space Center in Florida - the launch site for NASA’s now-defunct space shuttle program.

The X-37B program consists of two space planes - each 29 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a payload bay that is about the size of a pickup truck's bed.

The craft weighs about 11,000 pounds.

Analysts believe that the X-37B has the ability to see through clouds and bad weather.

Mystery
 surrounds the exact type and capabilities of the hardware aboard with 
some suggesting it will be used to support American soldiers in various 
warzones around the world.

Following an earlier launch, the Vice 
President of United Launch Alliance told the press: 'ULA is proud to 
have supported this mission and delivered critical capabilities to the 
men and women defending our freedom throughout the world.'

Pratt & Whitney, the firm that supplied the engine, released a 
press release in June that said: 'The reliable RL10 engine continues to serve a 
vital role ensuring these critical payloads are safely delivered into 
orbit, providing critical capabilities to our service women and men 
serving around the world.'

According
 to some intelligence analysts, the satellite contains high-tech weather
 imaging technology that allows it to effectively see through clouds and
 bad weather.

An NBC report
 following the first launch speculated: 'The rocket likely has a 
weather-imaging satellite aboard, according to intelligence analysts.

'The
 satellite can see through night and through bad weather, which means 
that it can also zoom in to 'countries of interest' with great detail, 
like a Google Earth on serious Cold War steroids.'

According
 to a ULA press release, the rocket was developed by the USAF to 'assure
 access to space for Department of Defense and other government 
payloads.'
