Australian tennis pro Bernard Tomic allegedly told a teenage girl he had a stash of cocaine worth $50,000, court documents say.

The young woman claims the 22-year-old sports star told her about the drugs while they were both at nightclub boss and developer Jamie Pickering’s penthouse in Surfers Paradise, Queensland.

The teenager’s allegation was heard at Southport Magistrates court, on the Gold Coast, on March 12, during a magistrate’s decision, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.

Magistrate Ron Kilner’s written decision said Pickering will have to stand trial for four counts of supplying cocaine, two of which were to minors.

Australian tennis pro Bernard Tomic allegedly boasted to a teenage girl that he had a stash of cocaine worth $50,000

Pickering is accused of supplying cocaine to girls as young as 16, between January and April, last year at his Surfers Paradise penthouse.

The nightclub owner is a friend of Tomic and the tennis star has previously partied at Pickering’s establishments such as Varsity and Sin City nightclub on the Gold Coast.

Pickering told the Gold Coast Bulletin that if Tomic did talk about cocaine to the girl it would have been a joke because ‘he doesn’t touch anything or even go near it’.

‘If it was said, I know it was in jest,’ Pickering said.

Pickering said Tomic would have no idea his name had been mentioned in court and was trying to contact him to let him know.

‘Puffery, people make jokes — if he said it, it was purely as a joke, and like I say it could only have been in jest. He would not have been serious in any way,’ Pickering reassured the paper.

Tomic’s name was mentioned by Magistrate Kilner as he spoke about the statements from four girls who claimed they’d seen a white powdery substance at Pickering’s penthouse.

They believed it was cocaine but one girl admitted that no one had identified the powder as drugs or cocaine.

Mr Kilner said in the decision: ‘The only exception to that statement was when Bernard Tomic stated to her on one occasion that he had $50,000 worth of cocaine.’

No charges have been made or considered against Tomic.

Pickering also told the Gold Coast Bulletin he strongly denied the charges against him.

Tomic currently lives in Monaco but lived on the Gold Coast in Queensland for 15 years

Tomic, who is ranked world No. 35, moved to the Gold Coast in 1996 at the age of three when his family migrated from Germany.

He currently lives in Monaco in Europe but returns to Australia to visit friends.

On one such trip, he was famously photographed partying at Pickering’s Sin City nightclub in 2013 while preparing for the upcoming Australian Open.
