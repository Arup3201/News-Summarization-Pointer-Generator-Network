Fresh questions about Britain’s role in Afghanistan were raised last night after commanders suspended the training of the country’s police militia amid fears it had been infiltrated by the Taliban.

Military chiefs took the drastic step in response to a rise in the number of murderous ‘green on blue’ attacks – where foreign troops have been killed by Afghan policemen or soldiers.

Rogue members of the security forces have carried out 34 attacks this year, killing 45 coalition troops, including seven British servicemen – a quarter of the UK’s 31 war dead since January.

Building up the Afghan National Security Forces is the key plank of Nato’s strategy for withdrawal of combat troops.

International soldiers are training and mentoring Afghan forces so they can assume responsibility for the country’s security by the end of 2014.

It means that Nato soldiers must work closely with the Afghan police they are training.

This requires them to live, sleep and go on patrol together.

But it involves a huge amount of trust, and this has been slowly eroded by the shocking rise in the number of ‘green on blue’ attacks.

There are 9,500 British troops in Afghanistan.

The suspension of training currently only applies to new recruits to the Afghan Local Police (ALP), a militia set up two years ago by US forces in villages where the Afghan National Police – a separate body trained by Nato – is weak. 

But the ALP has been beset by allegations of abuse and widespread corruption.

It is also believed that insurgents had infiltrated the organisation in order to carry out insider attacks.

US
commanders said they would temporarily suspend training of around 1,000
new ALP recruits and re-vet members currently belonging to the 
27,000-strong security force.

In July, Warrant Officer Class 2 Leonard Perran Thomas, 44, (not pictured) from the Royal Corps of Signals, Guardsman Craig Roderick, 22, (centre) and Guardsman Apete Tuisovurua, 28, right) of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, were killed in a 'green on blue' attack

And the sale of Afghan army and police uniforms will be made illegal so they are less likely to fall into Taliban hands.

Colonel Thomas Collins, spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘While we have full trust and confidence in our Afghan partners, we believe this is a necessary step to validate our vetting process and ensure the quality indicative of Afghan local police.’

He insisted the suspension of training would be ‘temporary’.But Labour MP Paul Flynn, said the decision was yet another reason to bring British troops home.

He said: ‘It’s about time we realised we are funding, arming and training our future enemies and it is only because of our misplaced optimism that we have got ourselves into this situation. There is no reason why Afghan police officers will put their own lives on the line to serve their corrupt president, let alone a foreign power. They are, however, very happy to take the enormous sums of money we have invested in the country.

‘We are in a terrible situation with politicians trying to spin an end to the war in a good light. The timetable for the end of the war is designed entirely for election purposes.

‘Canada and the Netherlands, who have both made great sacrifices in Afghanistan, have brought their troops home. There is no reason why we shouldn’t bring ours home now – independently of US troops.’

The Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, trained by Nato forces including British troops, are not affected by the suspension. The training of Afghan special forces will also continue.

On average, 7,000 Afghan soldiers and 3,700 Afghan police graduate from training every month.

Around 130,000 Nato troops are fighting insurgents in Afghanistan alongside 350,000 Afghans.

The ALP have been to blame for a number of green-on-blue attacks, but more come from the regular army and police force. Re-vetting the national police and the national Army would be an enormous task.

The coalition forces said they believed that 25 per cent of this year’s attacks had confirmed or suspected links to the Taliban.

Sometimes insurgents have infiltrated the ranks of the Afghan army and police but in other cases the Taliban has coerced legitimate members of the Afghan forces to turn their guns on foreign troops.

Intelligence reports have highlighted ‘deep concerns’ that one in ten recruits were vulnerable to being turned by the Taliban.
