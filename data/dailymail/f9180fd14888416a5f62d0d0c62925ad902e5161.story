The senior insurance broker in his late 40s whose office sex romp with a junior went viral is fighting to keep his job while living at home alone since the incident took place more than two weeks ago.

The man had sex in his Christchurch office with a woman almost half his age as stunned witnesses filmed the incident from a pub opposite.

He is a regional manager at Marsh Ltd insurance firm, and is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter.

While the man hasn't been back to work for two weeks, an insurance industry insider said he was desperate to save his senior management position, the New Zealand Herald reports.

The man at the centre of the New Zealand office sex romp which went viral has been revealed as a husband and father of two aged in his late 40s

‘He's fighting tooth and nail to stay,’ the source said.

‘There are a lot of legal difficulties that Marsh are having to go through, and they are going to take their time.

‘But [the man] is hoping that he can return in some capacity to a job that he loves.’

This information was contradicted by another source though, who claimed that Marsh Ltd wants him out because of the bad publicity it brought to the firm.

A neighbour of the family, who wished to remain nameless, said only the man had been around this week, and appeared to be home alone all day on Saturday.

‘The wife and kids haven't been about and he's been keeping a very low profile.’

The regional manager is still refusing to comment to the media on whether he hoped to get his job back or whether his wife was standing by him.

The New Zealand Herald also reported that the female employee involved in the sex romp, understood to be in her mid-20s, was not at her Christchurch home on Saturday and did not respond to messages. 

The steamy encounter between the two took place in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action.

Video footage and photographs by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide. 

Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man’s wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook.

Last week the Daily Mail revealed that a friend of the man’s brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved.  

The man's wife only found out about the affair when it went viral on Facebook, and is said to be devastated by the revelations

‘When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,’ the friend said.

‘After he didn’t reply he even asked, ‘It’s not you is it?’ He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.’

When the Daily Mail Australia called at the regional manager’s house in the affluent Christchurch suburb of Sumner to speak with him last Saturday, the man refused to open his door or answer any questions.

‘Get off these premises, get off these premises,’ was all he said from behind his front door. He then refused to reply to questions at all. The man appeared to be home alone at this time too. 

Patrons at the Carlton Bar and Eatery captured the scandalous behaviour more than a fortnight ago 

The regional manager wants to keep his job, but the firm claims the internal investigation is still ongoing

The man, aged in his 40s, would not answer questions and was home alone last weekend

However, when the Daily Mail Australia visited the premises the day before it was his wife that answered the door. She said that her husband was not at home and would not comment on the incident.

‘I’ve got nothing to say. He’s not here,’ she said. 

The wife's friends were supporting her, a neighbour said. It’s clear the marriage has an uncertain future. 

The ex-fiancé of the woman involved in the sex romp said their engagement was already over before the incident, and that it's sad 'for everyone involved'. 

He said he knew the other man who appeared in the video, but had never met him.
