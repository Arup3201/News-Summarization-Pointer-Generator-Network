All eyes will be on Aiden McGeady when he wins his 71st Republic of Ireland cap against Gibraltar on Saturday.

The 28-year-old scored twice to hand the Republic a priceless Euro 2016 qualifier victory in Georgia last month.

McGeady has shown flashes of brilliance throughout his career but has been dogged by inconsistency.

There are signs that the Glasgow-born forward is starting to produce on a regular basis for both club and country, with his move to Everton and a reunion with former Celtic manager Martin O’Neill perhaps the key factors. O’Neill, however, admits that he continues to be frustrated by McGeady – even in training.

‘Yesterday, he had the ball in the middle of the field, he tried to do a trick, he lost it and the other team went down and scored a goal,’ said O’Neill.

‘He’s a great player, a really great player. He has got the ability. I said before, he is the only player who could have scored the goal he did on the pitch (in Georgia), and it’s nice to have him. He has that and sometimes he will drive you mad, but he has got just that X-factor.’
