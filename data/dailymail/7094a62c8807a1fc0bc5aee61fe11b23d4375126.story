The mother of a Navy SEAL Team Six member believes that her son and other members of the elite squad were marked for death after the Obama administration identified them as the team who took out Osama bin Laden.

Karen Vaughn, the mother of Navy SEAL Aaron Vaughn, said in an interview that aired on Tuesday that her son was concerned for his safety after the team was outed.

She doesn’t, however, believe Aaron was one of the commandos who raided the terror leader’s Pakistan compound in May 2011.

But when Vice President Joe Biden identified the elite team of commandoes that took out the world’s most notorious terror leader, the soldiers got nervous.

Karen Vaughn told Fox News: 'Aaron called me and said, "Mom, you need to wipe your social media clean of any reference to me or any of my buddies. Just disconnect completely"'

She added: '[Aaron] actually said to me, "Mom, there's chatter, and all of our lives could be in danger, including yours."

'Then I realized all of those families, you know, you're talking about a community of around three hundred families who were all of a sudden made targets by this administration.'

The soldier’s father, Billy Vaughn told the network that he wishes elected officials would be more responsible with the sensitive information they handle.

He said: 'We expect better out of the high-up's in our government. We, as American citizens, look to our government. 

'We elect them, we look to them to take care of the best interests of the American citizen, and especially the warrior. And I believe what the administration did, then I believe it was criminal.'

On August 6, 2011, three months after the bin Laden raid, Aaron Vaughn was one of 30 U.S. servicemen killed when the Chinook helicopter they were riding in was shot down by Taliban militants over Afghanistan.

Karen Vaughn said that despite a new book detailing one SEAL’s account of the bin Laden mission, it’s the desire of Team Six members to stay private.

She told Fox News: “I can tell you one thing, SEAL Team Six did not want to be identified. So it wasn't that they were trying to be proud of them, because those men do not need a pat on the back. 

'They don't work for that. They spend their entire lives in this code of secrecy and privacy, and […] they do not want attention.'

The book, No Easy Day, was written by a retired Navy SEAL using the name Mark Owen, but Fox News later identified the man as 36-year-old Matt Bissonnette.

Aaron Vaughn, who was 30 at the time of his death, left behind two children.

It was just hours before the fatal mission Vaughn had called his wife, and spoke to his son for the last time.
