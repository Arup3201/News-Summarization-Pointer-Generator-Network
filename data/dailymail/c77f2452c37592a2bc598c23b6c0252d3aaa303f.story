The ‘arrogant’ teenage son of a decorated Royal Marine has been jailed for raping a girl at a lavish 18th birthday party.

Privately educated George Gray, 19, attacked the 17-year-old guest and forced himself on her in a bathroom.

Yesterday his father, Colonel Mark Gray, watched as the teenager was sentenced for the rape, which occurred at a party attended by 170 guests who had been entertained by opera singers and a seven-piece band.

Gray ‘guided’ his victim into a 
bathroom at the £3million property next to an area housing a swimming 
pool, gym and cinema.

There, he locked the door and raped her, covering 
her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream, the court heard.

The victim had agreed to 
kiss the defendant and to go to a quieter area of the house, but had 
made it clear she did not want to have sex with him.

David Sapiecha, prosecuting, had told the jury: ‘She told him to stop. 
She was trying to call out but he put his hand on her mouth.’

The court heard that, after the attack, the victim immediately told 
friends she had been raped and was taken to hospital.

Gray was told to 
leave the party and was walking to a friend’s home when a police officer
spotted him staggering, with blood on his face and shirt.

Private education: George Gray was a student at Truro School, which charges £3,835 per term for non-boarders, at the time of the sexual assault

The victim, 
now at university, said that she had known Gray for some weeks and 
thought he was ‘nice’.

But, describing the defendant’s actions at the party, Mr Sapiecha said: 
‘George Gray was clearly getting drunker and drunker and was a pest and 
misbehaving. He wasn’t interested when the victim said she didn’t want 
sexual intercourse. He didn’t care. He was forceful and injured her.’

Gray, from East Lyng, near Taunton, Somerset, denied having sex with the
girl or putting his hand over her mouth.

But he was convicted after a 
four-day trial and yesterday was sent to a Young Offenders’ Institute 
for four years.

He will serve half that sentence before he can be 
released and will be put on the sex offenders’ register for life.

Guilty verdict: George Gray was sentenced to four years at a Young Offenders' Institute at Truro Crown Court

Passing sentence, the judge, Mr Justice Burnett, told Gray he had come across in the witness box as ‘brash and arrogant’.

He added: ‘You have shown no remorse and consider yourself to be a victim in all this.’

Gray was 18 and a pupil at £22,000-a-year Truro School in Cornwall at 
the time of the rape on October 29 last year. Robert Linford, defending,
said Gray had suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder 
from a young age and was an immature person who tried to ‘big himself 
up’.

He added: ‘He continues vehemently to protest his innocence.’

Gray’s father has served in Northern Ireland, Iraq, Beirut and the 
former Yugoslavia, where, as part of the Nato-led International Security
Assistance Force in 1992, he defied land mines and booby traps to save 
20,000 lives from a planned Serb attack on a dam. He was made an MBE in 
2002.
