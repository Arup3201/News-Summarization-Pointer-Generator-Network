After years of quietly conceding defeat in our battle for wardrobe space, my husband Tom has finally snapped.

Perhaps he’d overheard me grumble ‘I don’t have anything to wear!’ one too many times. Or he had stumbled across the summer dresses I’ve hung on his clothes rail to make way for my winter purchases.

Determined to prove I have far more clothes than I need (or have time to wear), he decided to compile an inventory.

While I was out one day last week, he sorted through my vast collection of coats, jackets, dresses, skirts and trousers.

He’d taken on quite a task because my clothes have spread from my wardrobe and drawers into every inch of storage space, from the cloakroom to the attic.

When I returned home, I was stunned to discover a long line of near identical winter boots in the hallway. On the bed were piles of identical T-shirts, a mountain of long-sleeved tops and jeans, at least 20 black dresses and two dozen jackets.

In the spare room was a forgotten rail of party gowns — all worn just once or twice.

I stood there in silence, taking it all in. There were no other words for it: I’d been wardrobe shamed.

Not only had Tom made it glaringly obvious I have far too much of everything, he had cast a spotlight on something even more absurd: I buy the same thing over and over again.

I have 32 white tops. Every year, I buy new ones without a thought for those I already own. Yes, there are subtle differences in cut and sleeve style, but seeing them en masse I could understand Tom’s complaint: ‘Isn’t a white top a white top?’

Tom has just one suit, four pairs of jeans, three jumpers and a handful of shirts. So, why do I — and so many other women — have so many clothes?

Just last month, Jennifer Lopez revealed her wardrobe, filled with hundreds of pairs of jeans. London Fashion Week is testament to the fact women are for ever searching for their next ‘look’.

‘Men and women have been socially conditioned to value clothes differently,’ says psychologist Kate Nightingale, of Style Psychology consultants.

Men buy a new jumper to replace an old one but for women, clothes are more an emotional investment than necessity. Each purchase is tied up with self-esteem, body image and a desire to fit in or stand out.

After Tom sorted her clothes, Charlotte (pictured) started to wonder how she had managed to buy similar items over and over again each year 

We keep buying new things, says Nightingale, because we feel under pressure to constantly prove our allure.

We may be subconsciously seeking approval from friends or have reached a crossroads in our lives and want to reflect that by changing our image.

‘Women are more likely to hold on to things with positive associations or which represent a life goal, such as a dress that doesn’t fit, but hopefully will one day.’

Seeing my wardrobe laid out before me was as much a trip down memory lane as a wake-up call. There was the floral maxi dress from our honeymoon in 1999, and the linen blazer and matching dress I wore on my first day at work.

Though I have friends who shop as often as me, they clear out their wardrobes regularly. They’d never hold on to a moth-holed top because it reminds them of a holiday.

I also need to stop buying clothes that don’t suit me. Of all the clothes Tom discovered, I wear only a few regularly.

Women often mistakenly believe that the more clothes, shoes and accessories they have, the better dressed they’ll be, but the opposite is often true,’ says Debbie Roes, author of new book End Closet Chaos: Wardrobe Solutions From An Ex-Shopaholic (recoveringshopaholic.com).

‘Having a large wardrobe produces a false sense of security and abundance, but most women wear only 20 to 30 per cent of what they own.’

Debbie suggests we should do a wardrobe audit at least once a year. ‘Once you organise like with like, you can see where you are duplicating clothing and what, if any, real shopping needs you have,’ she says. ‘Try on everything and see if it fits, if you like it and if it works for your lifestyle.

‘An item could be in good condition, but may be dated or not suit your needs any more.

‘Our bodies also change, even if we remain the same weight and dress size.’

Tom (left) says he can't understand how someone could want so many similar items 

In my defence, I have been through a decade of sartorial upheaval due to three pregnancies and a work/life shift that saw me swap full-time office work to be a freelancer and full-time mother. Now I need to be tough and get rid of the power skirt suits and party dresses I no longer need.

So, I’ve started selling dresses I no longer wear on eBay. I’m also working through the identical white shirts, black trousers, skinny jeans and so on, with the aim of whittling each clothing group down to three. The rest must go.

My best discovery is the website girlmeetsdress.com, which loans out party frocks for less than £40. So, on the rare occasions I do go out for the night, I can keep up with fashion trends without clogging up my wardrobe.

TOM SAYS: Browsing a magazine last weekend, Charlotte spotted a £295 denim dress and announced her intention to buy it. I said surely it would be easier — and cheaper — to rummage through her wardrobe, where she’d find half-a-dozen identical denim dresses she already owns.

But Charlotte told me they were all subtly, yet significantly, different. And I should actually be praising her for her frugality!

By stockpiling all her purchases over the past two decades, she explained, she had worn them many times as they went in and out of fashion.

But take one of her wardrobe staples — the grey woollen top. She has amassed so many I have no way of knowing whether she has splashed out on a new one (as I suspect) or it really is ‘just that old thing I’ve had for years’.

I can’t understand why anyone would want so many similar items. Unlike my cricket jockstrap or skiing long johns, it’s not as if each performs a separate, essential function — they are so alike as to be indistinguishable.

And so I took matters into my own hands and played a game of fashion snap, piling up matching garments and shoes while Charlotte was out.

Charlotte has started selling the clothes she no longer wears on eBay and is using the website girlmeetsdress.com to rent dresses for a night instead of splashing out on a new outfit

It confirmed she owns far too many clothes that are very similar in style, colour and cut. But is that really surprising? We all have particular styles in which we think we look good.

Every time I buy a winter jacket, I return thinking I am at the cutting edge of male fashion. But then Charlotte asks why it is identical to every jacket I’ve bought since 1992.

But while that may be the case, for every jacket I buy, she buys five. And until now, she never throws anything out.

I am not convinced her new efforts to streamline her wardrobe will come to much. She put a pair of unworn ankle boots for sale on eBay. Just a day later, the listing had disappeared.

She explained that seeing the boots on the site made her realise how nice they were. They wouldn’t fetch more than £10, so by not selling them, she would not have to buy another pair. In other words, she was saving us money.

It’s logic, Jim, but not as any man would know it.
