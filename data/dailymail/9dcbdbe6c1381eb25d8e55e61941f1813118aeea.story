At first look anyone would think these were a series of adverts for a high-octane police action blockbuster.

But these posters featuring officers carrying crossbows and performing high kicks are in fact part of a recruitment drive for the Chengdu police force in south west China.

The force released the posters, each showcasing different qualities required by applicants including 'bravery' and 'toughness', on their official Weibo page.

They may look like adverts for the latest action movie, but these posters are in fact part of a recruitment drive for the Chengdu Police force

Chengdu Police are looking to recruit for a total of 359 positions within the force, including 100 posts for special armed forces and SWAT teams, Shanghaiist has reported.

The recruitment posters have attracted interest from online viewers, The Telegraph has reported, including one Weibo user who wrote: 'My future boyfriend will be like this.'

In May, China announced a nationwide, year-long 'anti-terror operation', days after announcing a similar crackdown targeting the troubled Xinjiang region, in the north west of the country, following an attack which killed dozens.

Security forces were ordered to prevent 
militants moving beyond the region in China's far west, which has a 
large Muslim Uighur minority and where five suicide bombers struck in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi.

'Police are urged to stop terrorists from striking again and prevent terrorists and religious extremists from spreading from Xinjiang to the rest of the country,' said the official Xinhua news agency, citing China's Ministry of Public Security.

A similar campaign was launched in Xinjiang days earlier after the region's deadliest attack in years which state media reported had killed 31 people at a vegetable market.

The attackers ploughed two vehicles into an open market and hurled explosives. Many of the 94 wounded were elderly shoppers, according to witnesses.
