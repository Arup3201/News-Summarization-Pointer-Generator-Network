The wife of a controversial MP says she has forgiven her husband despite his plonking and porn scandals.

The Liberal National Party's member for the Queensland seat of Redlands, Peter Dowling, gained international notoriety when an explicit picture he sent to his mistress of two and a half years of his penis in a glass of red wine went public.

In a pre-selection meeting at Redlands Community on Saturday, he was given the flick by local branch members, who voted 'no' to allow the MP to stand for them in the next state election.

The Courier Mail reported a shattered Mr Dowling was dumped by 55 votes against, compared to 38 votes for.

For the first time since the scandal Mr Dowling's wife, Helen, spoke out, standing by her husband of more than 25 years.

'There would be very few people here that actually could say they are perfect,' Mrs Dowling said. 

'He may not be perfect but he is effective.' 

Mr Dowling who was chairman of parliament's ethics committee was forced to resign last year after details surfaced of his affair and sexting scandal with his secret mistress. 

The Redlands MP was also close to being dropped by the state's executive this month but was spared.

After he exited the meeting on Saturday, Mr Dowling told waiting media: 'I have just been declined, so how about I go home and have a, no comment and enjoy a quiet, eh, actually I have a function tonight, so I'll go out attend the business awards as the LNP members for Redlands.'

Mr Dowling has not indicated whether he would reapply for LNP pre-selection but hasn't ruled it out either although earlier told The Courier Mail he ruled out running as an independent. 

While Mr Dowling claimed to have the full support from Queensland Premier Campbell Newman, the premier has abided by the decision made.

'Pre-selections are a matter for the party,' said the premier in a statement.

'What we're focused on is growing the economy and creating jobs, revitalising front line services and lowering the cost of living for Queensland families.' 

The LNP has confirmed it has now reopened nominations for the seat

'it was party democratic process, members had given a say on their local candidate,' said an LNP media spokesman.

'The nominations will close in a week and a half and at this stage we don't know of any candidates who have put their name forward.'

As for whether the state executives would reject Mr Dowling's nomination if he attempted to reapply? 

'Don't know anything at this stage.'
