A Canadian industrial rock band has sent a $666,000 bill to the Pentagon over allegations that interrogators at Guantanamo Bay used their music as a form of torture.

Skinny Puppy founder Cevin Key said the band learned of the alleged tactic from a fan and former guard at the detention center who is writing a book about his experiences there.

'Someone being forced to listen to something at deafening volumes for six to 12 hour at a time until they basically defecate or urinate themselves ... it's kind of like our music is being used as a torture device or weapon,' Key said in an interview with CBC.

Bill: Skinny Puppy, the Vancouver industrial rock band that sent an invoice to the U.S. military for allegedly using its music in Guantanamo Bay

Skinny Puppy: The band says its music has been played at Gitmo in the interrogation of detainees, and is now demanding $666,000 in compensation

'I am not only against the fact they're using our music to inflict damage on somebody else, but they are doing it without anybody's permission.'

He said use of the band's tracks - which utilise combinations of up-tempo drum beats, ambient music and synthesizers - was a tactic of one particular interrogator, according to the guard.

Key declined to name the guard due to potential litigation in the matter.

He said the band's 'music is unsettling for some to say the least, so I could only imagine if put into the wrong environment - it could be your biggest nightmare'.

Musical torture: Iwouldn¿t want to be subjected to any overly loud music for six to 12 hours at a time without a break, Key said

Key acknowledged Skinny Puppy having a strong fan base among members of the military, but said he 'wouldn't have imagined it being turned around in this manner'.

He said the revelation prompted the band to send a bill to the US Department of Defense for musical services rendered.

'We decided to come with a figure that would be somewhat relevant to the evilness of the deed, so basically we're invoicing them $666,000,' Key said.

He said the government had not yet responded to the bill.

Let the band play on: Cevin Key, the band¿s keyboardist, says the band at first planned to design an album cover based on an invoice for the U.S. government, rather than sending a physical invoice. But after learning that the government had allegedly used their music without permission, Key says the band was told it could bring a suit against the Department of Defense
