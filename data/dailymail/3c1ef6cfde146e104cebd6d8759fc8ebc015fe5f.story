She weighs less than 10st and wears a dress size ten. So it might be assumed a diet of fruit and vegetables play a part in Faye Campbell’s lifestyle.

But she claims she hasn’t touched either for 16 years.

Indeed, the 21-year-old says she has been diagnosed with a fear of fruit and vegetables.

Faye Campbell, 21, only eats junk food - she has never eaten fruit or vegetables. Despite her poor diet, she is a size ten and weighs just 9st 12lb

She
 says she has survived on a diet of cheeseburgers, pizza and chips. The 
only ‘fruit’ she consumes is the flavouring in sugary fizzy drinks.

But remarkably, despite her junk food diet, Miss Campbell, who is 5ft 8in tall, weighs just  9st 12lb.

The
 care worker, who lives in Stowmarket, Suffolk, was an extremely fussy 
eater as a child. At her wits’ end, her mother Carolyn took her to the 
doctor after failed attempts to hide vegetables in her meals.

She
 was apparently diagnosed with the digestive disorder gastroesophageal 
reflux. The condition, which causes chronic indigestion and heartburn, 
meant she was left in agony after eating.

Miss Campbell developed a phobia of 
food because of a painful digestive disorder she suffered from as a 
child. Until she was 15 she only ate chips

Miss Campbell said: 'The thought of eating vegetables or any sort of fruit just makes me feel physically sick. Even putting them near my mouth terrifies me'

But,
 although it was possible to cure this, doctors found she had developed 
lachanophobia – an extremely rare anxiety triggered by eating 
vegetables.

It is only after seeing a child psychologist that she started to eat foods such as pizza, burgers and cheese.

Miss
 Campbell said: ‘The thought of eating vegetables or any sort of fruit 
just makes me feel physically sick. Even putting them near my mouth 
terrifies me.

‘If mum is 
cooking a roast dinner with vegetables I have to go into a different 
room because I can’t stand the smell.

'Sometimes I have to open all the 
windows to get rid of it. My family wish I could sit with them and have a
 meal together, but I just can’t.’

Miss Campbell (pictured with her sister, Lauren) will leave the room if her mother is cooking vegetables as she cannot bear the smell - sometimes she has to open the windows to get rid of it

Miss Campbell's diet now consists of toast for breakfast, a large pizza from Dominos for lunch and cheeseburgers for dinner. She eats potatoes - if they're served as chips or waffles - and she can handle fruit - if it comes in fizzy drink form - but just the smell of any other vegetable is enough to turn her stomach

Miss Campbell (pictured at the age of six) had gastroesophageal reflux as a child. The condition, which causes chronic indigestion and heartburn, meant she was left in agony after eating

Miss Campbell (pictured with her sister, Lauren) said: 'I still can't bring myself to eat a roast or a home-made lasagne. It took me a good couple of years to get used to the other foods and I'm still fussy with that'

Miss Campbell (pictured as a baby) has, amazingly, avoided ill health despite her poor diet

Miss Campbell (pictured aged five) said: 'I would like to eat like a normal person, but until I can overcome my phobia of food, then that day won't happen for a long time'

Miss
 Campbell’s typical day starts with toast for breakfast, a large 
high-calorie pizza from Domino’s take-away for lunch and frozen 
cheeseburgers with chips for dinner.

She can only eat potatoes if they are served as waffles or chips and until she was 15 they were her sole diet.

Miss
 Campbell says her strange eating habits have also affected her love 
life with many romantic dates being swapped from expensive restaurants 
for McDonald’s.Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the Health Supplements Information
 Service, said: ‘This lady is risking her health with such a restricted 
diet.

‘The total lack of 
fruit and vegetables is worrying as these provide essential nutrients, 
such as vitamin C, for immune function support, vitamin A, for eyesight,
 potassium for blood pressure control. And magnesium and calcium, for 
healthy bones.

‘People with low intakes of fruit and vegetables have a higher risk of cancer, particularly bowel cancer, and heart disease.’
