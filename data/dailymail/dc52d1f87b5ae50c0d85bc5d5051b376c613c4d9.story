A luxurious spa with facials and massage, gourmet in-room dining menu and high-end suites with the best beds money can buy... all the things to be expected at any five-star hotel.

At The Wagington, though, the VIP guests enjoying the decadent comfort and first class service are of the four-legged variety.

The luxury pet hotel opened its doors on Tuesday in Singapore, hoping to welcome the furry friends of the country's wealthy residents.

Checking in: The Wagington is a 27-suite hotel catering to pampered pooches

The 27-suite hotel, where Junior Suites start from SGD$115 (£55) per night, is in a 4,317 square-foot colonial house in upmarket Demsey Hill.

Pampered pooches will enjoy grand suites with faux leather orthopedic memory foam beds and an in-room menu of kangaroo, rabbit and frog meats. The 96 square foot Royal Suite features a crystal chandelier.

There is a 32-inch TV that plays canine-themed films, and pool where the residents can swim under supervision.

Work it out: Four-legged guests can work out on the treadmill

Pampered pooches: There is a spa offering facials, massages, mud packs and 'pawdicures'

For those more interested in relaxing, the spa offers a range of treatments and salon services, including aromatherapy facials, massages, micro-bubble baths, mud packs and 'pawdicures'. The spa is open to all pets, not just hotel guests.

There is also a limousine service to ferry guests from the hotel to their homes at the start and end of their stay. 

Owner Estelle Taylor, who invested $700,000 in the business, says that they cater to an 'exclusive' market who don't mind splashing out on the very best for their pets.

Paddle time: The canines enjoy leisure time in the bone-shaped pool

First class service: As well as supervised swimming, there is a limousine service and dog films on TV

'We have a clean beautiful home, a comfortable bed when we are away - your best friend should be left in a place that's just like home,' says Taylor, 31. 

'If we deserve the best in life, shouldn't your most loyal companion deserve it equally?'

The exclusive hotel doesn't let in any riff-raff though. They will be enforcing a strict policy of not admitting 'aggressive' pets. All guests will undergo a 'temperament test' before being allowed in, as well as checks for ticks and fleas.
