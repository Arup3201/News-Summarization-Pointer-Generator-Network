Things are going from bad to worse for Anthony Weiner after his spokeswoman went off on an expletive-laden rant about a former campaign intern after she wrote an unflattering expose of his faltering New York mayoral campaign.

Barbara Morgan was so incensed by Olivia Nuzzi's actions that she lost her cool - apparently unaware that she was talking on the record - when she was being interviewed by politics website Talking Points Memo about another matter.

Weiner's communication director called the former intern a 'fame hungry b**** who sucked at her job,' she also called Nuzzi a ‘s***bag,’ ‘t***,’ and ‘c***' and threatened to sue her.

Weiner spokesperson Barbara Morgan, right, went off on an expletive-laden rant about former intern Olivia Nuzzi, left, after she had an article published which painted a very unflattering picture of his mayoral campaign

The over the top outburst was prompted by Nuzzi penning an article, published in Tuesday’s New York Daily News, in which she was highly critical of how Weiner's campaign was run.

She claimed many interns had only joined to get closer to Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, in the hope of landing a role in any potential presidential campaign for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

She claimed that one campaign staffer had left because he had only been paid one-third of what he was promised and that Weiner incorrectly referred to her and other interns as 'Monica.'

Morgan released a statement on Tuesday night apologizing for her outburst.

‘In a moment of frustration, I used inappropriate language in what I thought was an off the record conversation,’ she said.

‘It was wrong and I am very sorry, which is what I said tonight when I called and emailed Olivia to apologize.’

In the controversial article Nuzzi said ‘a lot’ of Weiner’s staff had ‘short résumés,’ including Morgan, who Nuzzi had mocked because she ‘last worked as the press secretary for the New Jersey state education commissioner.’

‘I’m dealing with like stupid f**king interns who make it on to the cover of the Daily News even though they signed NDAs and/or they proceeded to trash me,’ Morgan told TPM, referring to a non-disclosure agreement that Nuzzi would have signed.

‘And by the way, I tried to fire her, but she begged to come back and I gave her a second chance.’

Not how we roll: In a slick new ad, pictured, Weiner states: 'I know that there are newspaper editors and other politicians that say, "Boy, I wish that guy Weiner would quit"'

Morgan went on to suggest in her conversation to TPM that 
Nuzzi would be unable to ever get another job in New York politics as
 a result of her actions.

'F****** s***bag. Nice f**king glamour shot on the cover of the Daily News. Man, see if you ever get a job in this town again,' said Morgan.

She also described Nuzzi’s allegation as 
‘b*******.’

Nuzzi is believed to have stopped interning for the campaign four weeks ago 
and worked on the campaign for about a month.

Morgan said Nuzzi’s initially showed some enthusiasm for working for Weiner, but claimed that her ability left much to be desired.

‘She sucked. She like wasn’t good at setting up events. She was clearly there because she wanted to be seen. Like it was, like, terrible and I had to like - she would like, she would just not show up for work,’ said Morgan.

‘For the four weeks she worked there - she didn’t work weekends, so twenty days total. Of those twenty days, she missed probably five because she would just like not show up and not tell me she wasn’t going to be there. So, yeah, so there’s that.’

She hasn’t commented or tweeted since Morgan's outburst but has - rather amusingly - updated her Twitter profile to include several of the expletives used to describe her.

Beleaguered: A glum Weiner looks distracted as he listens to responses at the forum in Inwood

Also
 on Tuesday Weiner declared in a new ad that he would not quit the 
mayoral race because quitting 'isn't the way we roll in New York' 
despite looking exhausted and miserable at a public appearance just 
hours earlier.

In the 
advert, posted on his campaign website, Weiner stares straight at the 
camera and says: 'I know that there are newspaper editors and other 
politicians that say, "Boy, I wish that guy Weiner would quit."'

But the prolific sexter insists he owes it to New Yorkers to stay in the race.

'This
 isn't about me. This is about helping New Yorkers. Because they 
understand that this is about them. This campaign has reminded me about 
it again and again–in all kinds of ways.'

The ad was posted on Weiner's campaign website just hours after photographs showed him rubbing his eyes and sitting glumly in Manhattan, suggesting his latest sexting scandal was finally taking its toll.

End of the road? The former Congressman has dropped to fourth in the polls and it looks like it is taking its toll

He
 hit out at the media claiming: 'They don't know New York. They 
certainly don't know me. "Quit" isn't the way we roll in New York City.'

In
 the video, Weiner talks directly to the camera about the circus-like 
scandal dominating news headlines and how it has made him even more keen
 to serve New Yorkers.

'You 
know, if someone wants to come out with something embarrassing about you
 in your private life, you got to talk about that for a little while,' 
he said.

'But it's also 
reminded me that–citizens, when they come up to you, and they want to 
talk about a situation on their block, or at their child's school or 
something going on at their job site–that that's what this campaign is 
all about,' he added.

Earlier on Tuesday, the beleaguered mayoral candidate looked defeated during a forum on small businesses in Inwood.

But his former sexting partner could not have appeared happier.

Loving the attention: Sydney Leathers basks in the spotlight as she leaves an interview with Howard Stern

All smiles: Leathers grinned as she left the Sirius XM studios following her X-rated appearance

Sydney
 Leathers, who stepped forward with the revelations of their online 
affair a week ago, has been pictured basking in her new-found attention 
as she left an X-rated interview with Howard Stern.

The
 23-year-old student has also been pictured posing in her bikini as she 
frolicked on the beach in Santa Monica, California and has not shied 
away from numerous 'tell-all' interviews.

In
 an expletive-ridden interview with Stern, Leathers did not hold back as
 she detailed Weiner's fantasies, including having sex with her in the 
shower, and how he told her he was in love with her.

'He was like this needy girlfriend or something,' she laughed.

She
 added: 'I think I am a little bit angry with him, I feel like he lured 
me in to this situation. And then he didn't want to own up to it. On the
 campaign trail [he was] saying, "Oh I've changed" and trying to act 
like he has this perfect marriage now. I'm proof that you have not 
changed.'

In another sign that she is enjoying 
the spotlight, she was seen leaving the Vivid porn headquarters, and 
when Stern asked her about appearing in X-rated movies, she hinted it 
could be a possibility.

New ventures: She also hinted that she might be interested in taking part in pornographic films in the future

'I'm keeping all my options open,' she said, smiling. 'We'll see what happens.'

As
 well as Leathers' refusal to go away, Wiener is dealing with news that 
he has plunged to fourth place among Democrats in a poll taken since the
 affair emerged.

Just
 16 per cent of likely Democratic primary voters now say they support 
him, a number that shrank from 26 per cent less than a week ago, the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showed.

And
 a majority of those same voters said Weiner - who once led the pack - 
should withdraw from the race entirely, by a 53-40 margin.

'With
 six weeks to go, anything can happen, but it looks like former 
Congressman Anthony Weiner may have sexted himself right out of the race
 for New York City mayor,' said Maurice Carroll, director of the 
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.

Black
 voters were the only demographic group that seems to be hanging on to 
their support for the embattled former congressman, whose latest round 
of sexting accusations have brought his long-suffering wife out of the 
shadows to defend him once more.

Black voters say Weiner should stay in the race, by a 53-42 margin. White voters say he should go, by a larger 64-25 split.

Weiner's
 downfall has created opportunities for his rivals, including City 
Council Speaker Christine Quinn who now leads the Democratic pack with 
27 per cent support.

Public
 Advocate Bill de Blasio and Comptroller William Thompson are in a dead 
heat for second place, polling 21 and 20 per cent, respectively.

If
 Weiner should drop out of the race, the remaining contenders would stay
 in the same positions. Quinn would jump to 30 per cent and de Blasio 
and Thompson would each hover at 25 per cent.

'[W]ith Wiener in free-fall, it begins to look like a three-way race again'' said Carroll.

Weiner
 spokeswoman Barbara Morgan did not respond to a request for comment 
about her candidate's determination to remain in the hunt. The 
Democratic primary is September 10.
