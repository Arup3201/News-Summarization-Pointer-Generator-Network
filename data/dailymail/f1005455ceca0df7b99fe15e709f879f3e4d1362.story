Ailing: Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez pictured last month after his latest cancer treatment

Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez’s cancer battle has 'entered its end stage', it was reported today.

Chavez, 57, is not expected to live more than a few months at most, according to Spanish newspaper ABC.

The South American leader is now taking an opiate '100 times stronger than morphine' to relieve the severe pain of the aggressive cancer which has spread to his bones and the side effects of the chemotherapy and radiation.

The drugs are so potent that 'at any moment his body will not be able to tolerate them', according to doctors treating him.

Chavez is seeking re-election for a third time and registered his candidacy last Friday at the National Electoral Council. He already has a comfortable lead in the country’s polls.

But sources within the president’s cancer team believe it is doubtful he will live to see the results on October 7.

The medical report, seen by the Spanish newspaper, revealed that Chavez is also suffering from rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancerous tumour of the muscles attached to the bones, with metastasis.

As well as the painkiller fentanyl, medical specialists have also prescribed 'bisphosphonate to combat the metastasis' and 'corticosteroids to alleviate the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy'.

But the treatment is aimed at combating the spread of the cancer, not eradicating it, according to the report.

The dire prognosis comes weeks after Chavez said he was making a 'progressive recovery' after undergoing cancer treatment in Cuba. His chemo followed an operation in February to have a second malignant tumour removed.

The first tumor was extracted last June, also in Cuba, where the president’s cancer was first detected when he fell ill during an official visit.

Two months ago Chavez called on God to spare his life in an emotional speech to the Catholic community.

Chavez cried and his voice broke in the televised speech made in his home of Barinas, in front of his parents and other relatives.

He has not released any details about the nature of the disease, saying only that it was in his pelvic region.

He recently claimed the US may be infecting left-wing Latin American leaders with cancer after the presidents of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina were struck down with the disease.
