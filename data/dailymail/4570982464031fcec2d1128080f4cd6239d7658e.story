Strong words: Natacha Bouchart said the number of people trying to make it across the Channel was becoming 'untenable'

Calais is becoming a lawless town with ‘no security’ because of masses of migrants seeking to cross the Channel into Britain, the port’s mayor says.

Natacha Bouchart blamed British activists from the anarchist group No Borders for helping migrants set up illegal squats in unoccupied flats, houses and commercial property in central Calais.

The group, which campaigns for an end to immigration controls, is trying to give  the migrants shelter in France before they attempt their illegal entry into the UK.

Mrs Bouchart, 50, has previously blamed Britain’s asylum and benefits system for ‘imposing’ hundreds of illegal migrants on her city.

She said the number of people trying to make it across the Channel was becoming ‘untenable’ and radical action was needed.

In a move that has caused controversy in France, she made a plea to residents to report squats used by UK-bound illegal immigrants so that they can be shut down.

She has offered an email address which can be used anonymously to pinpoint groups of immigrants – as well as the British activists who help them – so police can visit the buildings and clear them out.

She called the dozens of squats ‘a plague which is spreading to the town centre, disturbing the peace of residents and tarnishing the town’s image’.

She added: ‘It is scandalous that we live in a state where foreigners come here to disturb our town and our residents.

'The migrants fight among each other and we do not feel there is any security at all.’

Mrs
Bouchart, who was born in France to an Armenian father and a Polish 
mother, complained to Spanish-born Interior Minister Manuel Valls that 
she lacked powers to take direct action against squatters and asked for 
Calais to be declared a high-priority security zone.

On her Facebook page, the mayor asked people to report squatters and No Borders activists who helped them find squats.

She
wrote: ‘Do not hesitate to email if you see No Borders or migrants 
settling illegally in a house. In this way the police can act by way of a
procedure which can be enacted 48 hours after an intrusion property has
been reported.’

Many have travelled from countries like Syria and Eritrea, and often pay people smugglers thousands of pounds for a place on a lorry or train across the Channel.

Xavier
Bellynck, a supporter of Mrs Bouchart, wrote on her Facebook page: ‘The
idea of launching an email address to report the squats is a good idea.

'It’s necessary to know that the migrants are being manipulated by No Borders and by the  people smugglers.

‘They are being used for political purposes, to the detriment of the people of Calais.’

But opponents have accused Mrs Bouchart, a member of the opposition UMP party, of pandering to the far-Right.

They
say she is trying to stir up hatred of the hundreds who are on their 
way to Britain to try to claim asylum, or else to start working in the 
black economy.

Mrs
Bouchart, who was elected mayor in 2008, was instrumental in the 
destruction of ‘The Jungle’, a massive open-air squatters’ camp close to
the ferry terminal, populated by hundreds of Afghans and Iraqis heading
for the UK.

Afterwards,
migrants scattered, squatting in makeshift camps and occupying WW2 
German bunkers along the Channel coast. In recent months they began 
targeting the centre of Calais.

No Borders is a shadowy group of activists campaigning for an end to immigration controls across Europe.

Motivated by an anarchist ideology, the British branch seeks to help migrants get around immigration rules and prepare them for life after illegal entry into the UK.

The group has been recruiting volunteers from throughout Britain, most of them ex-students.

Once recruited, they make regular trips to France to give would-be migrants food, sleeping bags, books and even phones and bikes, as well as helping them to find squats in towns such as Calais.

They are also trained to advise on means of illegal entry into the UK and what to do once a migrant arrives here.

The group’s website describes itself as the UK branch of an anarchist network that began in Europe in 1999.

It says it has no organised central structure, and is instead a loose collection of individuals who want to erase the borders created by ‘capitalist elites’.

The UK website for No Borders lists email addresses and phone numbers for several groups in the country, and details regular meetings in cities including Leeds and Cardiff.

One piece of advice they give illegal immigrants is not to answer any questions if they are stopped by the UK Border Agency.

They tell migrants that officers have no right to stop them on the basis of race, and advise that the worst course of action would be to give away their name and date of birth – from which other biographical information could be easily traced.

The manifesto for the group urges members to avoid ‘symbolic stunts’, and instead focus on ‘direct action’.
