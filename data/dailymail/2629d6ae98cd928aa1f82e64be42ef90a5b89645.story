Much-maligned Star Wars character Jar-Jar Binks is killed off in a deleted scene leaked from the Phantom Menace.

But everything is not as it seems as it appears the scene has been edited by one anti-Binks fan to show the character going to his watery grave.

The minute-long clip, apparently scrapped from the 1999 film, opens with Jedis Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) surfacing in their ship with Gungan Jar-Jar Binks on a fast-flowing river.

Unpopular: Jar-Jar Binks was derided by the Star Wars fan base

Realising their craft is about to be dragged over a waterfall and smashed onto the rocks below, the two Jedis shoot a hook into a brick wall and pull themselves across.

A panicky Binks fails to grab hold of the wire in time and as the force of the water pulls the vessel over the waterfall he is heard plummeting to his death.

But sharp-eyed Star Wars fans have spied this newly-surfaced clip, shown on digg.com, may not be the whole story.

As Sploid reports, this clip is an cut down version of the actual scene which has an extra 20 seconds of footage showing the Jedis pulling a soaked Jar-Jar out of the water before the three of them head away from the shore.

It is believed the original scene was released on DVD but then cut from later releases.

Fans of the blockbuster films have a long-running dislike of the unpopular character and some hailed the clip as the way the film should have been.

One commenter wrote: 'I'm so happy this exists, yet so sad they deleted it.'

Another added: 'I don't care if it makes kids cry. That was the Star Wars we deserved.'
