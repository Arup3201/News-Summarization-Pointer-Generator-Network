The discovery of a meth lab near your home can have a devastating effect on property prices with a 10.5 percent decline in sale prices for homes sold within an eighth of a mile of a lab, according to recent research.

The Department of Economics at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, also found that the negative impact of 'The Breaking Bad effect' can last at least two years after a lab is busted by the cops.

Consider the plight of the neighbors of drug kingpin Walter White in the hit TV show.

'The Breaking Bad effect': Living near a busted meth lab can cause serious harm to the price of your property

In last week’s episode of the series which ends this Sunday, the White family home was put up for sale by police auction.

Although the home was never used as a meth lab in the series, on the open market it would be viewed as guilty by association and White’s neighbors could expect to see their house prices plummet as a consequence. 

Exterior shots on the show are filmed in the Loma Del Rey neighborhood of Albuquerque. Based on the median home price of $265,000 for that area, homes on the same block as the White residence could expect to drop to $237,175 as a result of his drugs bust, reports Business Insider.

Holy Cross econ professor Joshua Congdon-Hohman first calculated how much damage meth labs cause to surrounding home values in his 2011 paper: 'The Lasting 
Effects of Crime: The Relationship of Discovered Methamphetamine 
Laboratories and Home Values.'

The discovery of a meth lab in an area can have a very damaging impact on house prices within up to a quarter of a mile of the lab

Using housing sales data from Akron, Ohio, which has that state's largest concentration of meth labs, he found:•    A 10.5 percent decline in sales prices for homes sold within an eighth of a mile after a lab is discovered. •    The decline can be as much as 19 percent within the first year after a lab is discovered.•    There is a 4.5 percent decline for homes sold within a quarter of a mile.•    The decline persists for at least two years afterwards.•    Just a single busted meth lab site can be enough to take down several blocks in a neighborhood.
