Brewery bosses were left red-faced after some of the lights on their iconic sign were switched off to spell out a rude message just days after the firm announced a string of redundancies.

The red neon sign above the Thwaites brewery in Blackburn, has blazed out like a beacon across the Lancashire town for decades.

But shortly after the firm announced they would be axing up to 60 jobs, the letters H, I and E mysteriously disappeared, leaving a rather indignant message presumably aimed at bosses.

Bitter blow: The iconic Thwaites brewery sign in Blackburn spelled out an altogether different message after the firm announced a series of job cuts

Although it has not been confirmed that the sign change is linked with the job cuts, suspicions are disgruntled employees are to blame.

Jobs: The brewery has recently announced up to 60 redundancies at the plant

The first sightings were made at around 
4.40pm on Friday.

Within 15 minutes the entire sign was blacked out 
before the lights were restored to normal working order.

A spokesman for Thwaites said that on being alerted the brewery turned the lights off and launched an investigation into what had happened.

He said: 'When made aware of it, all the lights were immediately switched off.

'It's not clear what happened, whether there was a fault or other problem but only a few people have access to that part of the building.'

Twitter went into overdrive on the topic last night.

One Twitter user Luke Gilrane said: 'Think Thwaites Brewery might have annoyed one of their employees.'

Another, Matt Bury said: 'Thwaites Brewery lay off workers in Blackburn. Here's their response for all the world to see.'

David Corrigan said: 'I have been awaiting this moment for years. I am overjoyed'

Samuel Williams tweeted at Thwaites: 'Your sign's a bit unfortunate at the moment!'

And Andy Hicken added: 'A superb employment of knackered bulbs.'

Redundancy announcements were made after the firm announced plans to close the majority of its Blackburn brewery.

Bosses at the firm said negotiations with the council and supermarket chain Sainsbury's to build on the site had failed.

A spokesperson said: 'The lights at the brewery were affected for a very short time on Friday.

'They are now back to normal but our main concern continues to be for those valued employees who have been affected by our proposed restructure which was announced last week.'

The move means large-scale brewing at the town centre site will cease, but Thwaites intends to keep the visitor centre and craft brewery, Crafty Dan, on the current site.
