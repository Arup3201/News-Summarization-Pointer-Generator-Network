Derek Hardman, 31, was discovered snoozing by pensioners Betty Spencer, 77, and husband John, 71

A 'Goldilocks' burglar who fell asleep on the sofa in the house of his pensioner victims after he had raided £10,000 worth of jewellery has been jailed.

Derek Hardman, 31, was discovered snoozing by pensioners Betty Spencer, 77, and husband John, 71, after he had prowled around their bedroom, and plundered jewels and Mr Spencer's fishing equipment.  

The career criminal was found snoring away on the couple's bedroom sofa after he became 'overcome with tiredness'.

Mrs Spencer, who had been in the lounge watching television, discovered the sleeping raider and called for her husband and neighbours.

The group then poked the criminal to wake him up - and held onto him until police arrived.

Hardman - who has a string of burglary convictions -  had sneaked in to the couple's sheltered accommodation through an unlocked door on the afternoon of May 5, and made his way into their room as they watched television, Bolton Crown Court heard.

He was said to have been 'overcome by tiredness' as he rummaged around the couple's first-floor flat in Deane, near Bolton, Greater Manchester.

Initially Hardman searched the room, moving jewellery worth £10,000 and fishing equipment.

But he decided to 'take a breather' on the sofa in the bedroom's bay window and dozed off.

When he was woken up, Hardman tried to bite the leg of one of the neighbours but the fabric of his trousers saved the victim from injury.

Police called to the flat, found six diazepam tablets in his pocket.

Inquiries revealed Hardman was on licence from a previous prison sentence at the time of the raid.

In 2010 he was jailed for seven and a half years after he forced his way into the home of 93-year old great-great-grandmother and pushed her over so he could grab £100 from her purse. Yet is is thought he had been freed early last year for good behaviour.

He has a long history of previous convictions for theft and burglary, including 12 months for burgling an 87-year-old woman in May, 2003, and 22 months for robbery in February, 2008.

His targeting of OAPs led to calls for CCTV to make the elderly feel safer at home.

On Tuesday Hardman pleaded guilty to burglary with intent, assault and possessing diazepam and was sent back to jail for a further two years and eight months.

He claimed he had no recollection of the incident. Hardman is not due to be released until 2017.

At a previous hearing, defence counsel Philip Parry said Hardman was 'in the vice-like grip' of drug addiction when he committed his crimes.

He added: 'He is very sorry for what he has done and is trying to get clean in prison.'
