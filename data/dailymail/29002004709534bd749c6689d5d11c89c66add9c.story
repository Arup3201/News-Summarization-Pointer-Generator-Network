Lance Corporal Todd John Chidgey died in a non-combat incident in Afghanistan

The Australian soldier who died in Afghanistan from a 'non-combat related incident' has been identified as Lance Corporal Todd John Chidgey.

Lance Corporal Chidgey was on his sixth tour of Afghanistan when he was found dead in the Australian headquarters at the main coalition base in Kabul earlier this week.

The lance corporal was found by colleagues in an administration building at the Kabul base with the gunshot wound about 2pm on Tuesday.

Defence has refused to go into the details surrounding the 29-year-old's death while an investigation is pending.

He has been described as a 'consummate professional' who earned the respect of his comrades through dedication and hard work.

'Lance Corporal Chidgey's colleagues in the 2nd Commando Regiment have described him as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates,' Defence said in a statement.

The decorated soldier was born in Gosford, NSW and joined the Australian Defence Force in 2006.

He was posted to what is now the 2nd Commando Regiment, serving in Afghanistan on tours ranging from two weeks to six months.

At the time of his death, Lance Corporal Chidgey was part of the protective security detachment providing protection for a senior Australian officer.

He is the 41st Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan.

Lance Corporal Chidgey's colleagues found him in an administration building with a gunshot wound around 2pm Afghanistan time on Tuesday.

He was taken to the nearby medical facility for emergency medical treatment but later died surrounded by his comrades.

An investigation is underway into the circumstances surrounding his death.

Australia has now ended involvement in combat operations in Afghanistan but about 400 personnel remain in a variety of jobs, including headquarters staff and Afghan National Army mentors.

Lance Corporal Chidgey is survived by his mother, father, brothers and partner.

Defence Force chief Mark Binskin on Wednesday said after the incident he soldier was taken to a nearby medical facility for emergency treatment.

'Sadly, the soldier's injuries were too severe and he later died surrounded by his mates,' he said.

The base was in lock down last night so evidence could be collected and the Defence Force has since launched an investigation.

'It is critical that we let this investigation take its course, to examine the evidence and establish the facts rather than to speculate about the details or circumstances surrounding the incident,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said.

Defence offered its condolences to the soldier's family and friends.

So did Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss who described the incident as tragic considering Australia's engagement in Afghanistan had largely ended.

'We don't know a great deal about the details as yet but I certainly extend sympathy to the family and friends of the soldier whose life has been lost. Our feelings are with the family,' he said.

Australia has now ended involvement in combat operations in Afghanistan but some 400 personnel remain in a variety of jobs, including headquarters staff and Afghan National Army mentors.

There's also a significant security presence to guard against both Taliban or insider attacks.

The last Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan was another Commando, Corporal Cameron Baird, killed on June 22, 2013 and subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross.

When asked about post-traumatic stress disorder in the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Binskin said: 'I am confident in what Defence does in the mental health space'.

In 2013, former Middle East commander, retired major General John Cantwell, warned of a looming tsunami of PTSD among those who have served in recent operations.
