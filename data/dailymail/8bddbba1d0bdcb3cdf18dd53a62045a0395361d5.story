The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 
donned futuristic 3D glasses tonight as they watched the premiere of a 
remarkable new nature film.

The
couple were attending a black-tie gala screening of a new film by Sir 
David Attenborough, Natural History Museum Alive 3D, which brings to 
life some of its most famous – but extinct – inhabitants.

Kate,
31, who is patron of the museum, was wearing a favourite black lace 
Temperley evening gown for the third time – looking as trim as she did 
on the other two pre-baby outings.

Kate wore a much-loved Alice Temperley lace gown to the event. The dress was also worn by the Duchess at the War Horse film premiere in 2012

Kate dug out the bespoke full-length 
dress for the premiere after first wearing it to the opening of War Horse in 2012.

And the stunning gown was also dress of choice for the Duchess when she attended a dinner to mark the 600th anniversary of St Andrew's University.

Inside the couple were introduced to 
legendary naturalist Sir David Attenborough standing underneath an 
extinct giant ground sloth, the megathenum americanum.

The Duchess chatted animatedly to the presenter, asking him about what kind of creatures they could expect to see in the film.

She
was then presented with gift of stills from the film by the twin 
children of the CEO of the production company, Jessica and Francis 
Geffen, aged three and a half.

Their
father Anthony Geffen said afterwards: 'She is brilliant with children 
and asked them about Christmas and whether they had seen the film at all
– they have seen some clips. It’s wonderful that Sir David is bringing 
his brilliance to a new generation.’

Inside
they were shown to their seats in the grand entrance – which houses the
museum’s most famous resident, a diplodocus called Dippy – which had 
been turned into a screening room and handed a pair of 3D glasses each. 
Popcorn and cinema-style sweets had been left on every chair.

The
Duchess giggled as she was handed her glasses but gamely donned them 
alongside her husband – joining a long line of royals to risk looking 
faintly ridiculous wearing them in public, which includes the Queen and 
the Prince of Wales.

Among 
the audience were newsreader and presenter Natasha Kaplinsky and Game Of
Thrones star Stephen Dillane, who are high profile supporters of the 
museum.

Tonight's engagement was the second of the 
day for the couple, who went privately to South Africa House just a few 
hours earlier to sign the book of condolence in memory of Nelson 
Mandela.

Kensington Palace 
had not made the visit public in advance as William and Kate wanted to 
pay their respects privately, but the visit was captured by a passing 
photographer who snapped the Duchess in a smart polka dot suit she was 
first seen wearing in 2007.

Clearly,
however, there was time for a quick change back at Kensington Palace 
before the couple headed to the Natural History Museum for the private 
screening.

Kate chose the stunning gown for the premiere of the film War Horse in January last year

This time accessorising the Temperley favourite with a red clutch bag, the Duchess picked the lace gown for a dinner to mark the 600th anniversary of St Andrew's University in November 2012

The 
ground-breaking film sees Attenborough bring his favourite long-extinct 
creatures to life through 3D and state-of-the-art CGI technology as he 
roams the corridors of the historic London landmark at night.

As
the doors are locked and as night falls, dinosaurs, ice age beasts and 
giant reptiles come alive in front of his eyes: including the giant 
Diplodocus, the dinosaur that famously welcomes visitors to the museum’s
Central Hall; the moa, a long-extinct giant flightless bird; and 
gigantophis, a snake that grew up to 36 metres around 40 million years 
ago.

The film is a 
collaboration between Natural History Museum scientists, Sky 3D and 
Colossus Productions.

Produced by a BAFTA and Emmy award-winning team, 
it was shot by the same 3D team behind recent cinema release Gravity 
with visual effects produced by a team whose combined credits include 
the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises.

It will be broadcast 
on Sky channels on New Year’s Day.

Tonight’s
screening will be followed by a Q&A with Sir David Attenborough, 
hosted by Sky News presenter Dermot Murnaghan, and others involved with 
the project including Dr Paul Barrett, Natural History Museum Dinosaur 
researcher.

The Duke and Duchess, who will also attend a reception with the film’s producers, are expected to listen in.

David Attenborough said: ‘I have been coming to the Natural History Museum since I was a boy. 

'It’s one of the great places to come to learn about natural history.

'In
this film we have the technology to bring back to life some of the most
romantic and extraordinary extinct creatures that can be conceived; 
some are relatively recent animals like the dodo, others older like the 
dinosaurs, and some we only know through fossil evidence.

'Using
our current scientific knowledge, this film brings these creatures 
alive allowing me to look at some of the biggest questions surrounding 
them.'

He added: 'I hope 
that it will make people think about these extinct creatures differently
and bring the Museum to life in a new and exciting way.’

Earlier today the Royal couple visited South Africa house in Trafalgar Square to sign the book of condolence for Nelson Mandela who died last week
