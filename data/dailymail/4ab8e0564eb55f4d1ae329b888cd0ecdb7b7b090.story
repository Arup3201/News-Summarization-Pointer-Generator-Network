 

Tyson Fury had predicted that the war which preceded his heavyweight encounter with Dereck Chisora would be ‘the fight of the night.’ He was right.

The minor epic in which Billy Joe Saunders put a stop – probably temporary – to the rise of Chris Eubank Jnr was indeed the fight of the night at the ExCel in London’s Docklands.

But what Fury did not expect was to be booed to victory.

Chisora’s face was swollen as a pumpkin by the end of the 10th round and his eyes virtually closed. So the complaints were not against the doctors and his corner deciding to spare him from further punishment.

What dismayed the 15,700 capacity crowd – and the referee for that matter – was the manner of what masqueraded as a final eliminator to challenge his eminence Wladimir Klitshcko for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world.

After a snappy start to proceedings Fury opted to settle into a repetitive pattern rather than finish off Chisora with a burst of aggression.

Round after round Chisora came plodding forward and the leaning tower of Manchester picked him off with alternating left and right jabs, plus the occasional clubbing combination.

Fury kept doing enough to win the rounds but did not extend himself to apply the knock out which was there for the taking.

Referee Marcus McDonnell put an absolute stop to the inaction in the eighth to warn them: ‘Either you fight or we go home.’ The crowd were heading for the exits soon after.

Perhaps Fury’s reticence was rooted in the size of the prize at stake. He saw no need to risk a shock defeat which would have snatched the Klitschko bonanza from his grasp. It will not concern him yet that a performance like this would be unlikely to trouble Wlad the Impaler.

But the public were not best pleased. 

When they put a halt to proceedings so predictable that Chisora clearly had no chance of winning, the arena gave a collective sigh of relief.

Chisora came out fast but was stopped in his tracks by Fury’s first heavy right of the fight. Chisora was a much fitter proposition for this rematch than in their first encounter three years ago. But then the stakes were higher now. He was working hard to get inside the towering Fury’s long reach.

This is as fit of body, sharp of mind and quick and accurate of punch as we have seen Fury. At times he was smiling in admiration of his handiwork. Chisora kept walking forward – into a variety of punches form the challenger for his European heavyweight title.

From the first bell, Fury was on top and Chisora failed to land a decisive blow over the 10 rounds he was in the fight 

Both men were told to come together and fight but it was Fury's long range and his jab which kept him in control 

Fury was switching between left and right jabs and starting to land at will. When swayed out of range of a wild swing from Del Boy he turned to the crowd seeking applause for his remarkable athleticism for so huge a human being. Chisora was caught with four big punches in short order and began backing away in alarm at Fury’s power. The first decisive round was massively in favour of the Manchester traveller.

There are still times when Fury likes to amuse himself by changing the script even when it is in his favour. So he spent the start of the fourth letting Chisora swarm over him in the ropes.

Then he unleashed a barrage of lefts and rights which staggered the Londoner to win another round.

Chisora’s face was beginning to swell but he took encouragement from connecting with one of his big right-hand swings. Fury then returned to picking him off.

Chisora kept coming – albeit more sluggishly. Fury kept landing the jabs from either wing. The crowd began to get a little restless and sporadic booing broke out as Fury ticked off another round.

Fury called Chisora a baby but was himself admonished by McDonnell for flicking Del Boy with the back of his right hand instead of punching correctly.

‘That’s not boxing,’ said the official, By now more of the crowd were in agreement with that sentiment. Although this was child’s play for Fury so far.

If Chisora’s ears were closing as rapidly as his eyes he would not have heard the cat-calls. But there was no mistaking the referee’s disapproval for the sporadic action. With Fury seemingly content now just to coast through the fight, McDonnell stopped the action completely and warned them both; ‘Either you fight or we go home.’

So on we went, Chisora peering through slits, Fury landing whenever the mood took him, albeit not often enough to entertain the 15,700 throng in the ExCel.

Chisora’s belief was ebbing away and when he backed away Fury opened up a little. But not enough to close the show? At least not by himself. The end of the round brought a medical consultation to Chisora’s corner and they pulled their half blind man out. He had not won a round and clearly had no chance of winning.
