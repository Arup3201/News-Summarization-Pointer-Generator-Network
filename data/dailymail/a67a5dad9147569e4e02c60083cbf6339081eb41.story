If he had his way, Paul Ryan would have been attending the inauguration in a very different capacity - as the new vice president.

Instead, the Republican representative was just another face in the political crowd on Monday and suffered the indignity of being loudly booed as he left the Capitol building in Washington D.C.

The former VP hopeful said last week that we would attend the swearing-in ceremony of President Obama because it was his 'obligation'.

Unimpressed: Republican representative Paul Ryan was booed as he attended Obama's inauguration on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol today

Lost the race: Ryan attends Obama's ceremonial swearing-in at the Capitol on Monday

The Congressman appeared to take the boos in his stride, conveying little reaction to the crowd's negative response during an otherwise upbeat day.

According to conservative blog Red State, the booing was started by Dan Freeman, an attorney who works at the Department of Justice.

Ryan earlier wrote a gracious message on his Facebook page where he addressed Obama's inauguration directly.

He wrote: 'I congratulate President Obama on his inauguration, and I join the country in celebrating this American tradition.

The president and I were political opponents. We had strong disagreements over the direction of the country - as we still do now. But today, we put those disagreements aside. Today, we remember what we share in common.

'We serve the same country, one that is still in need of repair - and is still the freest on earth.

'We serve alongside men and women from 
both parties, who govern in good faith and good will. Finally, we serve 
the same people, who have honored us with their charge.

Defeated: Paul Ryan appeared with Republican colleagues to watch one-time rivals for the White House Barack Obama and Joe Biden being sworn in

Absence: Former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was nowhere to be seen today and was believed to be at his family home in La Jolla, California

We may disagree on matters of policy. But today we remember why we take those matters so seriously - because we seek the public good. It’s our highest duty - one that we share - and one for which we’re grateful.

I’m happy to mark this historic occasion - for the president and for the country. And I look forward to tackling the big challenges ahead.'

Ryan's running mate Mitt Romney was 
not at the inaugural ceremony on Monday. He was 3,000 miles from 
Washington at his home in La Jolla, California with his family.

Whether he watched the day's historic days is debatable although one former aide said it would be 'doubtful'.

Second term: Barack Obama is sworn in as the 44th President of the United States today as wife Michelle and daughter Sasha and Malia look on

Pride: Joe Biden is sworn in as Vice-President today at the Capitol in D.C.

The President savored his special day as hundreds of thousands of supporters gathered to witness his second inauguration, grinning as he waved enthusiastically to the crowds lining Pennsylvania Avenue.

And in a moving display of his appreciation as he left his public swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol building early on Monday afternoon, he was seen pausing a moment to look back towards the crowds and reflect on the vast sea of people before him.

'I want to look out one more time because I'm not going to see this again,' he said quietly to someone next to him as he took in the spectacular view.

Obama was sworn into office by Chief Justice John G. Roberts as the president's proud wife Michelle and two daughters, 11-year-old Sasha and 14-year-old Malia, looked on. Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic woman to sit on the Supreme Court, then swore in Joe Biden as Vice President.
