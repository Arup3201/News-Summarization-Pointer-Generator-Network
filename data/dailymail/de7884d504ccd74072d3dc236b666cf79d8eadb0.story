An eager NOFX fan who jumped on stage to hug Fat Mike got more than he bargained for when he was slammed to the ground by the lead singer.

Sydney local Alex Medak attended the band's Sydney show on Tuesday night, when he decided it would be a good idea to invade the stage and grab a moment with his favourite rocker.

However, Mike Burkett aka 'Fat Mike' had been complaining of neck pain throughout the show and didn't take too kindly to the Alex's stage dash.

Alex managed to slip past security and approach the singer from the left-hand side of the stage.

In the video, unwitting NOFX fan Alex can be seen sneaking up behind Fat Mike and throwing his left arm around the unassuming American rocker.

Within seconds, Mike turns around, pushing the stage invader's arm away from him and punching him directly in the face.

Alex immediately falls to the floor from the sheer force of the punch.

The red-haired punk singer then proceeds to kick Alex in the face while he is still lying on the floor.

Security guards surround the Sydney man while Mike calmy goes back to entertaining the audience.

The enthusiastic fan took to his Twitter account to reveal himself as the scorned fan, posting a message to the Suits and Ladders vocalist's personal page. 

'@FatMike_of_NOFX thanks for the KO mike, didn't hurt too much. Soz for creepin up on you like, punk shows are a bit different down here,' Alex said. 

Fat Mike didn't take too kindly to the stage invasion and punched Alex in the face causing him to slam onto the ground. Mike then kicked out at him while he was on the ground

In an unprecedented move, Fat Mike replied to the star, apologising for his uncharacteristically violent behaviour and offering to buy the fan a beer. 

'I'm sorry too Alex, I was in terrible pain all night. When you grabbed me by the neck I defensively reacted... offensively @alexanderpeterq,'

Alex replied to the singer, claiming he has drank far too much alcohol that night and he was to blame for the event and urged his Twitter followers to 'calm down'. 

Fat Mike took to his Twitter account to apologise to the 'drunk' fan

'@FatMike_of_NOFX No worries mike, i completely forgot you mentioned your neck hurting, I was way too drunk,'

Fat Mike offered to buy his Sydney fan a beer should he make it to Friday night's concert at the Enmore Theatre. 

Alex replied claiming he would love to attend the event but he could not afford to go.

He told Mike that he would be free to show him around Sydney before the band left.

In reply, Mike's tour member Stephen Garret got in contact with Alex on Twitter, claiming he would add his name to Friday night's guest list.

'Come back and find me. We will have a better night tomorrow!' Mr Garret tweeted to Alex.

One fan who was following the conversation on the social media page, expressed his disgust at Fat Mike's actions. 

Stage invader Alex Medak took to Twitter to diffuse the situation, telling his following to 'calm down'

James A Barron II said: ' i used to admire fatmike b4 i saw him to that to a fan,'

'Don't blame him. He said his neck was in pain and I still went up and obviously hurt him,' Alex Medak said in reply. 

Other users were wary of the supposed fan, calling him out on the fact that he only created a Twitter account to tweet the NOFX frontman. 

Alex replied, showing a picture of his swollen lip and holding up his NOFX ticket. 

Alex posted a picture to his Twitter account to verify his identity. He held up his concert ticket and displayed his bust lip

'not a fake account, heres photo of my swollen lip and in what i wore,' he said. 

Alex also defended Fat Mike, claiming he aggravated the singer by jumping on to the stage.

'I'm sure he feels terrible, and so do I. It's the past now for both of us, and the public needs to stop worrying as well,' he said.

The band will finish up their tour on the 23rd of November at the Coolangatta Hotel on the Gold Coast.
