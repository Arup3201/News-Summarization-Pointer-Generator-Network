It is almost seven months since Louis van Gaal took over at Manchester United and you would have to say that they are still not where they would have hoped to be in terms of team development.

They may be satisfied with their position in the table — they can return to third place if they beat West Ham — and it’s difficult to argue with a run that has produced one defeat in 16 games.

But there is still something that doesn’t quite gel about this Manchester United team. 

Wayne Rooney has been asked to play in midfield in order to accommodate the likes of Angel di Maria 

Di Maria has been playing at the tip of the diamond in recent weeks with Rooney playing in a deeper role 

Radamel Falcao has been given the chance to prove his worth by partnering Robin van Persie in attack 

Rooney's Opta heat map against Cambridge showed he barely featured in attack, with much more time spent either out wide right or in his own half

The back-three line-up looks as though it will be dispensed with for now. Although there have been injuries which have hampered Van Gaal’s ability to play that system, there simply are not enough players who have adapted to it. They really look more comfortable in a back four at this point. 

Earlier in the season it was the defence which had proved the big problem, but in that 16-game unbeaten run they have conceded just seven goals. It is not an assured back line just yet but it is a long way from the chaos of the 5-3 defeat by Leicester in September.

In attack, though, I only see glimpses of a team who are really clicking and usually that is only at Old Trafford. Van Gaal has now had long enough with them that offensively they should look comfortable, especially with the array of talent he has at his disposal.

The individuals themselves can look impressive at times — Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria or Wayne Rooney — but, especially away from home, it still looks as though they are sorting out how to play. And it’s a long way into the season to be still sorting this out.

At the heart of that is the problem of where to play Rooney. Van Gaal wants to play two up top and the versatility of Rooney means that he is the one to drop in to midfield, with Van Persie and Radamel Falcao as the strikers.

I don’t have a problem with Rooney in midfield. In fact, I think it can suit him and become his best position in the later stages of his career. But which part of the midfield do you play him?

If he is one of the attacking players in a 4-3-3 formation, with at least one midfielder holding a defensive role, then I think he can thrive in that position. He has the licence to break into the box from the deeper positions and face the play, rather than have his back to goal. I think that could work to his advantage. He also has the vision to play great passes and pick out his team-mates from midfield, so I understand why Van Gaal wants him there. I can even see him at the tip of a diamond in midfield, but that seems to be the role for Di Maria.

What does not work is when he is playing in a diamond as one of the central midfielders behind Di Maria. That is not his role. There’s too much tracking back to be done in that position and he will end up in very deep positions.

You want Rooney to be the hub of the team, breaking into the box.

Also, in that position, you have to pull wide at times to give the team tactical stability. That again takes him away from the action.

I can see that the diamond formation might seem the most natural way for Van Gaal to go at the moment but it won’t get the best out of Rooney — and if you don’t get the best out of Rooney then it’s difficult to see that it will be best for Manchester United.

It is important they do work out a style which does flow in these final months of the season. If they qualify for the Champions League then I’m sure most people at the club would say that was a job well done for this campaign. Next season, of course, the expectation will be much higher. But they do need that top-four spot to ensure they can keep recruiting the best players next season.

And that is not at all certain.

Tottenham are coming on a good run; Arsenal have Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck coming back; Liverpool already have Daniel Sturridge back, which should make an enormous difference.

Plus, my old club Southampton are so well set up that they will cause all those teams more worries before the season is over.

I said at the start of the campaign that United would not finish in the top four unless they got their defenders back. It’s still looking like it will be a close-run contest and, with a couple of their rivals in the ascendancy, United cannot afford to look like a team in transition.

The Red Devils will be hoping to secure a spot in next season's Champions League during the next few months

It was sad to leave Queens Park Rangers this week but once Harry Redknapp had decided that he couldn’t go on, it felt like the right thing to leave at the same time.

Harry brought me in there to do a specific job and, once he had gone, there seemed no point in staying.

It was a surprise how quickly it all turned out.

Harry has been in pain for some time with his knees and the news that he needed an operation was a real blow to him. Last time that happened he was on crutches for 12 weeks.

That said, we were in and out of the relegation zone and I reckon if Harry had been able to stay, we would have climbed out of the bottom three once again.

Glenn Hoddle decided to leave QPR following Harry Redknapp's resignation from the west London outfit 

Everyone on the coaching staff was aware that we needed better results. But equally it looked as though fortunes were going to ebb and flow throughout the season among the teams towards the bottom.

Each week another team or manager seems to be under pressure. We were confident we could make sure it wasn’t us by the end of the season.

I’ve heard all the theories as to why he left but I don’t believe it was related to the January transfer window.

The club tried to bring in the right players but, as deadline day approached, it simply became harder and harder.

Hoddle enjoyed his time at QPR but it was only right to leave the club following Redknapp's departure 

I have enjoyed the past six months, however. I’ve never been in a pure coaching role before and, though I was apprehensive when I went into it, I discovered that I really enjoyed it.

Clearly as manager there has to be a degree of distance between you and the team. You’re always the man who has dropped half of the squad, so it’s impossible to be too close.

But that wasn’t the case as a coach and I found I liked being that much closer to the players.

I also enjoyed coaching the Under 21s at times. There are a good crop of players coming through at QPR from there. My hope for the club is that they do now stay up under a new manager.

There were some good people at the club and I enjoyed my time there.

As for the future, I have some business interests and I enjoy writing this column and of course I have my punditry with Sky Sports and ITV.

Some offers have come in but for now I’ll take stock and work out what is best for me and my family.
