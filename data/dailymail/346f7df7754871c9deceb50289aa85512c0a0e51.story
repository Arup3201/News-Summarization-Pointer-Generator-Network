The Michigan-based parents of two young daughters  are facing a double tragedy after both being diagnosed with cancer in the last year, it has emerged.

Shelby Offrink, 31, and her 34-year-old husband, Ben, had just welcomed their second child, Hazel, now one, into the world prematurely when Mrs Offrink was given devastating news.

The new mother was diagnosed with Stage IV glioblastoma, a rare and incurable form of cancer on her spine. She was  forced to undergo months of intense radiation and chemotherapy.

Several months into her treatment, last August, her husband fell ill. He visited his doctor and was told his own cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, had returned for a third time.

Family: Mother Shelby Offrink, 31, and her 34-year-old husband, Ben, (pictured with their daughters, Hazel, one, and Maeve, three) are battling a double tragedy after both being diagnosed with cancer in the last year

Mr Offrink, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Maeve, with Mrs Offrink, was forced to undergo chemotherapy, as well. He now needs a bone marrow transplant to survive.

Unbelievably, last month, the unfortunate pair were dealt another blow when Mrs Offrink underwent an MRI scan, according to KSDK.com. Doctors discovered three new tumors in her brain.

'It's shocking. At first it just seemed like a terrible dream,' said Luke Tomczak, Mrs Offrink's younger brother. Her other brother, Jake, added: 'This has been the most challenging year of their lives.'

Despite their horrific situation, the Offrinks, who live in Lowell, are bravely choosing to remain optimistic. They are currently raising money to help fund their medical bills via a YouCaring page.

Because Mrs Offrink was forced to give up her job as an engineer following her diagnosis early last year (Mr Offrink was a stay-at-home father to their two little girls), the bills are piling up.

Over the past 12 months, relatives and friends have helped Mr Offrink to care for Maeve and Hazel - who turned one in December - while Mrs Offrink undergoes extensive treatment to extend her life.

'I feel a lot of their pain,' said Jay Tomczak. 'I think one of the things that has made it possible for them to get through is the love and support from the family and all the friends.'

During her radiation and chemotherapy sessions, Mrs Offrink has maintained an 'intelligent, witty sense of humor,' according to her relatives. She is pictured beaming in many family photos.

Meanwhile, Mr Offrink has also remained upbeat, despite his first round of chemo proving ineffective against his cancer. He is now set to undergo another course of treatment.

If he responds well to the second round, Mr Offrink will be able to undergo a necessary bone marrow transplant. Two donors have reportedly been identified as a perfect match for him.

'Seeing him get weaker has been a really hard thing. We love him like a brother and we are there to support him as much as we can,' said Jay Tomczak told the news station.

On the dedicated YouCaring page, the Offrinks' friends and family have thanked donors and well-wishers for their support, which 'has already started to help [the couple] in tremendous ways'.

A post, written on February 2 by one of the Offrinks' friends, reads: 'We would like to thank everyone for their overwhelming show of love and support for the Offrinks.

'I think we can speak for Ben, Shelby and both of their families and say that everyone has gone above and beyond and totally blown away any expectations previously had.' 

On Friday, the couple held a 'Hoops for Hope' spaghetti dinner and basketball game fundraiser at Lowell High School. Overall, they have so far raised $51,651 of their $100,000 goal.
