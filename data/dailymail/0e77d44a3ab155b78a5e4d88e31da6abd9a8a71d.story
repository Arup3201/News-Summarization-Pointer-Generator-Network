Ed Miliband brushed off Labour's shock defeat in the Bradford West by-election by claiming the party is set for a return to power at the next general election.

His party suffered a humiliating blow when Respect's George Galloway overturned a 5,000 Labour majority to storm home with a lead of more than 10,000 votes on Thursday.

But in an interview with The Observer, Mr Miliband said that it was David Cameron and the Tories who were on the back foot after a week in which they were pilloried for the Budget and for sparking panic buying of petrol.

His comments were reinforced by a new opinion poll today which revealed that voters believe the Government has lost
touch with ordinary people and overwhelmingly blame ministers for 
triggering panic-buying of petrol.

Mr Miliband said: 'I think it is going to be remembered for the end of the Cameron project.

'Thursday night was a very bad result
but there is a big picture about where politics is and I think people 
will look back on the last few weeks and say that was when the Cameron 
project hit the buffers and this was when Labour had their chance.'

He added: 'Opposition is a long and difficult haul. It is going to be a one-term haul, I am confident about that.'

The ComRes poll for The Independent 
on Sunday and Sunday Mirror found almost three-quarters - 72 per cent - 
said the coalition was 'out of touch with ordinary people'.

Four out of five of those questioned 
said that ministers had caused an unnecessary panic over the threat of a
strike by tanker drivers.

The findings will make grim reading 
for David Cameron after a week in which ministers have come under 
sustained attack.

The poll found 71 per cent believed Chancellor
George Osborne had been wrong to extend VAT to hot pies and pasties 
while 64 per cent disagreed with the so-called 'granny tax' - scrapping 
age-related allowances for the over-65s.

Following reports that the Tories 
tried to provoke a confrontation with the tanker drivers to create a 
'Thatcher moment' - echoing Margaret Thatcher's clash with the miners - 
Mr Miliband said the Government needed to come clean about its handling 
of the dispute.

'Over the last few days its every move has been designed to whip up unnecessary tension at the expense of the public,' he said.

War of words: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused ministers of deliberately provoking a confrontation with the unions because they wanted to recreate Margaret Thatcher's clash with the miners in the 1980s

'Ministers knew all along that a 
strike could not possibly be less than seven days away even were it to 
be called - that is the law.

'Yet they panicked the nation all the way to the petrol pumps because they imagined it would boost them in the polls.'

But
despite the problems which have beset Cameron and the Conservative 
Party this week, Mr Miliband is still a leader under pressure.

He describes the Labour defeat to Mr Galloway as 'deeply disappointing' and admits that lessons need to be learned.

The opposition leader says he will soon be visiting Bradford to discuss how his party came to lose a formerly safe Labour seat.

And with Cameron facing the most serious crisis of his premiership so far, the pressure is now on Miliband to take advantage of his rival's misfortune to win new support.

Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show this morning, shadow home secretary Yvette 
Cooper accused ministers of deliberately provoking a confrontation with 
the unions because they wanted to recreate Margaret Thatcher's clash 
with the miners in the 1980s.

'They created this petrol crisis,' she said. 'What 
they did was they caused a run on the pumps for political reasons 
because they wanted a "Thatcher moment".'

Meanwhile, a YouGov poll for the 
Sunday Times put the current state of the parties at 42 per cent for Labour, up 
two on last week, and 33 per cent for the Conservatives, down two from last 
week.

The Liberal Democrats are down one on 8 per cent and other parties are on 17 per cent, the survey found.
