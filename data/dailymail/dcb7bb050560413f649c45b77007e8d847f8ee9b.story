Day care owners who spent 21 years in prison before being freed amid questions over their convictions for child abuse involving satanic rituals are struggling to convince prosecutors that they should be fully exonerated.

Dan and Fran Keller, who divorced in prison, were freed on bond last year when the only physical evidence against them was found to be a mistake. 

But prosecutors say to overcome a jury finding of guilt, the courts require new evidence that unquestionably establishes innocence such as an ironclad alibi or DNA proof.

Fighting to clear his name: Dan Keller, 73, has appealed for a court to declare him innocent. He was released from jail in Austin, Texas, in 2013 after 21 years amid doubts over his sexual abuse conviction

The couple had been convicted in 1992 after therapists testified that they helped three children recover memories of satanic rituals and sexual abuse at an Austin preschool the Kellers operated.

However, an appeal found the only physical evidence came from an emergency room doctor who testified that internal lacerations on one child were evidence of abuse.

And children whose testimony led to a conviction have since claimed they were pressured to lie.

The Kellers, who always denied the charges, want the courts to throw out their convictions. 

But a year after they were freed from prison, Travis County prosecutors remain unwilling to proclaim them innocent, the Austin American-Statesman reported Sunday. 

'Our responsibility is to make sure the law is properly applied, and, under the applicable standards, we are not satisfied that they have established actual innocence under the law,' Travis County Assistant District Attorney Scott Taliaferro said.

That standard seems unfair to Fran Keller, who said there is no way to conclusively prove a negative.

'It's so hard to prove you're innocent when there was never a crime,' she said.

The Kellers had been sentenced to 48 years in prison. 

But in court documents filed in 2013, Dr. Michael Mouw says what he thought were lacerations were actually normal physiology.

That prompted prosecutors in Travis County, which includes Austin, to agree that the case's evidence was faulty and release the two on bond.

Evidence needed: Fran Keller and her ex-husband need concrete evidence proving their innocence to overthrow the jury's guilty verdict. The pair were jailed for allegedly engaging in satanic rituals and abuse

The Kellers' claim of innocence will be decided by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, where a core of conservative judges typically takes a skeptical view toward overturning jury verdicts. 

The court will be guided by the recommendations of Senior District Judge Wilford Flowers, who presided over the Kellers' 1992 trial and their recent appeals — and who has already twice ruled that they had failed to prove their innocence.

Fran Keller's attorney, Keith Hampton, said: 'The case was a true witch hunt because the investigators actually believed that this was part of a wide satanic conspiracy.' 

He said the therapist's techniques — which were used to convince the children, parents and investigators that the Kellers committed human sacrifices, sexually abused them with pens and dismembered human bodies in cemeteries — have been debunked.

The Kellers were sentenced after just a six-day trial, according to KUT. The couple were among hundreds of childcare workers who were accused of being part of a group of Satan worshipers who engaged in ritual child abuse across America during the 1980s and 1990s. 

'The Keller case is definitely about the panic back then,' said Hampton.

Between 1984 to 1989, some 100 people nationwide were charged with ritual sex abuse and 50 were put on trial, according to Debbie Nathan of the National Center for Reason and Justice, which works to free those wrongly imprisoned.

Many have since questioned a number of the cases, which they said were based on faulty testimony coaxed out of children from purported experts on recovered memories and backed by dubious medical testimony on signs of sexual abuse.
