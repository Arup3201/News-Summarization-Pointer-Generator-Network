When Willie Tatum III was arrested following a four hour stand-off with police, he was clearly unhappy with the situation.

So when the Columbus, Ohio, police department uploaded the 23-year-old's mugshot to Facebook, he decided to take the opportunity to defend himself.

Alongside the picture, he wrote: 'Too bad I'm already out. How do I break in my mom's house with a key? When I tried to show the police my key, they pulled guns on me and my brother so we stayed inside. The charge changed 3 different times while inside. SWAT for a "dv"? Come on now.'

Shamed: Columbus Police posted this mugshot on Facebook of Willie Tatum III after he was arrested following a four hour stand-off with police

Angry: The suspect took the opportunity to defend himself by commenting below the picture. He questioned how he could have broken into his mother's house when he had a key. The post was then deleted 

His comment was deleted shortly after another user wrote 'this is awkward' below the post.  

Mr Tatum then made the photo his Facebook profile picture while others re-submitted his comment

A police spokesperson wrote on Facebook, denying accusations they had taken his reaction down. 

They said:  'The Columbus Division of Police reserves the right to remove any content for reasons including, but not limited to, comments that contain obscenities, off-topic comments and personal attacks,' it wrote on Facebook.

'Mr Tatum's comments did not fall under this policy and were not removed by the Division of Police.'

Police, who sent a SWAT team to the address, said the stand-off ended 'without incident'.

The suspect has been charged with aggravated menacing and domestic violence.

The photo has since been shared more than 150 times and has attracted over 200 comments. 

Many of them criticized the police department for sending a SWAT team to the property while others condemned the fact the comment was taken down. 

Reaction: After a number of social media users accuse the force of taking down the message, a spokesperson wrote on Facebook denying that they had deleted Mr Tatum's comments
