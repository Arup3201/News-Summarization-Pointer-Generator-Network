Airline baggage fees from the likes of Ryanair are now so high that it can be cheaper for holidaymakers to use a specialist courier.

For while Ryanair would charge £35 to put a standard 20kg suitcase in the aircraft hold on a one-way flight to Malaga, the courier firm SendmyBag would do it for £6 less.

This means that a family of four could save £48 by sending their luggage by a courier to their holiday destination and back rather than taking it on a plane.

Similarly, research by Which? found that Ryanair would charge a staggering £500 to put a set of golf clubs in the hold on a return flight to Malaga.

However, the courier company ‘FetchMy’ would transport the same set of clubs door to door for £140 – a saving of £360.

Which? said Ryanair is not alone in imposing punishing fees for carrying large items of holiday luggage.

Airlines can charge hefty fees when passengers go over their luggage allowance. Which? has found using courier services is often a cheaper alternative

A Which? spokesman said: ‘It's surprising that it can work out hundreds of pounds cheaper to get sports gear chauffeured to your destination rather than putting it in the hold.

‘It's worth checking out the prices of couriers before booking your plane tickets but it will require a bit more forward planning as most couriers need to pick up bags a few days before departure.’ 

It is estimated that airlines around the world make approximately £23billion every single year from 'upsells' and additional fees such for extra luggage allowance.  

The increasing cost of taking luggage on planes has led to a soar in the use of couriers.

Sendmybag.com has seen the amount of luggage it is transported increase by 400 per cent on last year's figures and now delivers to 50 countries around the world.

The ever increasing cost of extra or overweight luggage at airline check-ins has long been a bone of contention for consumers.

Former Westlife star Brian McFadden refused to board his Ryanair flight when the airline said he would have to pay an extra £80 to fly his golf bag from Liverpool to Spain.

The singer then berated the Irish airline on Twitter for 'stealing from your own people!'

He instead caught a train to London where he got on a different flight.
