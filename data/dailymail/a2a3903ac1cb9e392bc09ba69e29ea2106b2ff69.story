A barrister has been fined £2,000 for an online attack on witnesses who were due to give evidence at the rape trial of his Tory MP friend.

Henry Hendron was disciplined for a blog in which he called alleged victims ‘manipulative and duplicitous’.

Law chiefs said the 33-year-old was guilty of professional misconduct when he made the ‘disparaging statements’ the day before the high-profile trial of former Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was due to start.

Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans was cleared of nine sexual offences against Parliamentary researchers. Mr Evans' friend Henry Hendron attacked witnesses in a blog post written on the eve of his trial

Mr Hendron, a civil barrister who has represented clients including Tory MP Nadine Dorries and Apprentice winner Stella English, wrote about Mr Evans’ accusers: ‘Most of the complainants are known largely as self-serving, with their own political agendas, with a manipulative and selfish streak.’

He added: ‘In my view... some of these people are not victims but duplicitous individuals, acting together in a pack-like mentality to bring down a well-respected and well-known politician.’

Mr Hendron, who charges up to £1,750 a day and is described on his website as ‘impressive, determined and tenacious’, was forced to grovel to the trial judge for almost jeopardising the case.

The barrister was told his actions had caused at least one alleged victim to consider pulling out of the trial.

Apologising for his ‘huge misjudgment’, Mr Hendron said he got the idea from the way paralympian Oscar Pistorius was supported by friends during his murder case. The Attorney General decided not to bring charges of contempt of court.

But Mr Hendron, who works at Strand Chambers in London, reported himself to the Bar Council and has now been found guilty of professional misconduct by The Bar Standards Board.

A ruling says he risked harming the public’s ‘trust and confidence’.

Last night Mr Hendron said: ‘Obviously with hindsight I should not have put up the blog and I took it down as soon as it was drawn to my attention that there was a problem.

'It was a rather expensive blog post and one that I will never repeat.’

Mr Evans, the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, was cleared in April of nine sexual offences against Parliamentary researchers, including raping a young man at his Lancashire home.
