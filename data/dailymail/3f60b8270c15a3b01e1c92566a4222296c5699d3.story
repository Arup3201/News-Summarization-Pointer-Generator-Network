U.S. and Arab war planes launched 29 air strikes against Islamic State fighters and buildings across both Iraq and Syria overnight, according to military chiefs.

Syrian targets included he Islamic State's defacto capital of Raqqa, and Kobane where Kurdish Peshmerga and YPG forces have been involved in street battles with extremists for months.

The city of Dayr az Zawr, which contains 600,000 people and is the largest in Syria's east was also among the cities hit.

In Iraq targets were hit around the town of Mosul, which contains an important dam, Fallujah, which is located just to the east of Baghdad, and Sinjar, which thousands of Yazidis were forced to flee after ISIS fighters took the town earlier this year.

In total 17 bombs were dropped over Syria and another 12 over Iraq, though the exact split between the target cities has not been announced.

The latest round of bombings against ISIS targets in the Middle east takes the number of strikes since Christmas above 100, as the U.S.-led coalition attempts to weaken the radical group.

As well as key towns such as Raqqa and Kobane, strikes have also hit Al Asad, Al Qaim, Baiji, Kirkuk and Tal Afar in Iraq.

As the bombing runs were carried out last night Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad went to deliver a New Year's message to troops in the east Damascus district of Jobar last night.

State TV showed the despot having dinner with soldiers and pro-government gunmen during the rare appearance.

The news came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced that the death toll from the four-year civil war topped 76,000 in the last year alone.

An estimated 17,790 were civilians, including 3,501 children, making it the deadliest year of the war.

Heavy fighting in the strategic neighbourhood killed at least 25 Syrian soldiers and pro-regime militia on Wednesday before the visit, the observatory said.

Assad was shown sharing a meal of baked beans, boiled potatoes and tomatoes with soldiers and pro-government gunmen known as National Defense Forces.

Last year was the deadliest of the four-year conflict in Syria, with 18,000 civilians killed after being caught in the fighting with 3,500 of those being children

'On New Year's Eve families gather but you decided to be here to protect your country,' Assad told the troops as sporadic shooting could be heard.

'I like to be with you on this occasion.'

Assad described rebels who use underground tunnels as 'rats', adding 'we fight them above the ground'.

The footage, aired today, showed Assad shaking hands and kissing troops, walking into fortifications and climbing onto a tank.

Syrian troops have been fighting against rebels in Jobar since 2013 and according to state media, government forces have been advancing in the area.

Assad's visit came as rebels fired nearly two dozen mortar shells on Damascus, residents said. It was not clear if there were casualties.

Assad has rarely made public appearances since the country's crisis began in 2011.

Just hours after Assad's forces carried out bombing missions against residential neighbourhoods in Damascus he paid a visit to troops in the area to eat food with them

The last time he visited the frontline was in August 2013, when he went to the former opposition bastion of Daraya outside of Damascus.

The war began in March 2011 with peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's government, but quickly escalated into a full-blown civil war after a brutal regime crackdown.

In addition to civilians, more than 15,000 rebel fighters were killed, as were nearly 17,000 militants from jihadist groups, including the Islamic State and Al-Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate.

At least 22,627 government forces - both soldiers and members of pro-government militias - were killed, the Britain-based group said.

Last year's figure compared with 73,447 in 2013, another 49,294 in 2012 and 7,841 in 2011.

More than 200,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-regime protests that spiralled into a war after a government crackdown.
