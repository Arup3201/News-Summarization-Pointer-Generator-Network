Protesters gathered to yell at New York police officers mourning their slain colleagues outside a memorial on Monday night.

The group of five people were heard shouting about Eric Garner and Michael Brown at the corner in Brooklyn where officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were shot dead on Saturday afternoon, which is now covered in flowers and tributes.

The shocking scene recorded by CNN comes just two days after gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley murdered the cops claiming it was an act of justice for the two black men killed by white police officers.

Controversy: A group of five protesters could be heard shouting at police officers at the memorial on Monday

Despite statements from the families of Eric Garner and Michael Brown condemning Brinsley's attack, many fear there are members of the community who will not accept appeals for calm.

This is the only report of friction between the community and the police force since the double murder. 

It came as CNN's Sara Ganim was reporting from the scene. She said: 'I do, just in full disclosure, want to say that in the last couple of minutes, for the first time today, we've seen protesters come out here and start yelling at groups of police who are mourning their slain police officers.'

Ganim continued: 'It's just a few of them, Suzanne, and like I said, just in the last five minutes, and they're quite frankly yelling at a group of police officers who are standing here silently, just looking at the memorial of candles and flowers and posters, and they're yelling similar rhetoric that we've been hearing over the last couple of weeks related to the shooting of — the chokehold death of Eric Garner and the shooting of Michael Brown in Missouri.' 

Pei Xia Chen, the widow of murdered NYPD officer Wenjian Liu, fought back tears as she expressed her support for the family of Officer Rafael Ramos, the other officer shot and killed on Saturday

She added that most officers she has spoken to have condemned the police union's attacks on Mayor Bill de Blasio, saying now is a time for peace. 

Ganim also emphasized that until that point she had seen no tension between the NYPD and the community at the memorial.

‘We’ve seen quite actually the opposite,’ she added. ‘We’ve seen community members coming here and shaking hands with police officers, giving them hugs. 

'We’ve seen groups of officers, NYPD, showing up all day to pay their respects. They’re lighting candles side-by-side with the community. They’re interacting, they’re showing support to one another.’

Also on Monday, the wife of officer Liu broke her silence  and said her family was thankful for the support it has received following her husband's murder.

Pei Xia Chen fought back tears as spoke about the man she had just married in September. 'His dreams were of providing for his current and growing family,' she said.

Chen also expressed her support for the family of Officer Rafael Ramos who was on duty with Liu when the officers were shot and killed.  

'We would also like to express our condolences to the officer Ramos' family,' said Chen. 'This is a difficult time for both of our families, but we will stand together and get through this together.'

Chen was surrounded by weeping family members as she spoke outside their Brooklyn home.

Wenjian Liu's family were from Canton, China, and had moved to the U.S. in 1994 when he was a 12-year-old boy. 

He had joined the NYPD in 2007 after majoring in accounting at The College of Staten Island. The couple had only married in September and were 'looking forward to having [their] own family', according to an earlier statement.

'He was an asset to the police department, using his Chinese language skills whenever and wherever it was needed,' read the statement.

Funeral arrangements for Liu have not been announced, but his parents - who have been described as 'distraught' at losing their only son - are receiving help from authorities so that family members can travel from China to attend the service.

Mayor Bill de Blasio visited both officers' families on Monday and urged New Yorkers to stop anti-police protests in the wake of the officers' assassination during a press conference 

Mayor Bill de Blasio visited both officers' families on Monday and urged New Yorkers to stop anti-police protests in the wake of the officers' assassination.

He stressed the city's focus should remain on the grieving families.

'This is a time for every New Yorker to think about these families. Focus on these families. Put them first,' de Blasio said during a press conference on Monday afternoon. 

'We can do that by respecting their pain, respecting their time of mourning. Until these funerals are past, let's focus just on these families, and what they have lost. I think that's the right way to try and build towards a more unified and decent city.'

The mother of the gunman who murdered two NYPD officers on Saturday has also extended her condolences to their families and said she is 'deeply sorry' for her son's actions.

Speaking on Monday, Shakuwra Dabre, 54, of Brooklyn said she identified with the families pain because she too had lost a son.

'I am still deeply sorry about what happened at the hands of my son,' she told  the Daily News . 'And please accept my deepest condolences, sincerely.

Dabre said that her son had struggled with mental illness his entire life and had repeatedly refused attempts by the family to try and help him.

'Unfortunately, this situation happened and it culminated in the end of his life and the tragic loss of two innocent police officers,' she said.

Dabre was out running errands on Saturday when she was alerted that her son was in trouble by the estranged mother of his child.

She raced home and when she scanned the news on her laptop she saw a photo of a man lying on a stretcher accompanying a story about the shooting.

'I knew he was dead when I looked. I knew. He was gone. I knew he was my son,' Dabre told DNA Info through tears.

When Dabre first saw the picture of her son on the stretcher, she didn't know he had shot and killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, she said.

'I was so torn when I saw him on that stretcher,' she said. 'Then I found out too that he did that. And I was horrified. Because I didn't want no loss of nobody's life.'

Mourning: Eric Garner's 22-year-old daughter Emerald Snipes visited a memorial to two slain NYPD officers Monday, expressing her condolences to their families

Farewell: NYPD officers saluted while visiting the memorial to officers that had grown at the site of the police slaying 

'As a mother now I hurt for the loss of my son. Just like they're hurting for the loss of their sons.'

The daughter of Eric Garner, whose chokehold death at the hands of a cop sparked mass protests against the NYPD, also offered her support for the family of two murdered officers on Monday.

Emerald Snipes, 22, laid a wreath at the site where a cop-hunting gunman killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Weinjen Liu, and said she knows how it feels to spend the holidays without a father.

'I just had to come out and let their family know that we stand with them, and I'm going to send my prayers and condolences to all the families who are suffering through this tragedy,' Snipes told ABC.

Assassin Ismaaiyl Brinsley used her father's death as justification for gunning down two innocent officers over the weekend. 

Snipes told the New York Post she visited the Ramos family. She also described being moved by a Facebook post from 13-year-old Jaden Ramos, expressing his grief over the death of his father.

'It hit my heart,' Snipes told the New York Daily News while she laid the wreath. 'I know how it feels in this season to not have your father around.' 

Prayers: A memorial for Officers Rafael Ramos and Weinjen Liu, who were shot while sitting in their patrol car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, gathered wreaths and prayer cards from those expressing sorrow for the killing

Memorial: Snipes was joined by Dominique Sharpton, daughter of Rev Al Sharpton, who has been vocal about calling for protests in the wake of Garner's death by chokehold by a plainclothes NYPD officer

'Today I had to say bye to my father,' Jaden wrote in his Facebook post. 'He was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer.'

Snipes was joined by Dominique Sharpton, daughter of Rev Al Sharpton, who has been vocal about calling for protests in the wake of Garner's death by chokehold by a plainclothes NYPD officer. 

'I was never anti-police,' she added. 'Like I said before, I have family that's in the NYPD that I've grown up around, family reunions and everything so my family you know, we're not anti-police.' 

Tensions have escalated after the shooting by 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who wrote 'They take 1 of ours...let's take 2 of theirs' and referenced the deaths of Garner and Mike Brown on an Instagram post he made while traveling to New York from Baltimore.

Some of the bitterest rhetoric has come from the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and its president Pat Lynch, who told reporters there was 'blood on many hands' on Saturday.

Lynch placed blame on the mayor, Bill de Blasio, and protesters for the killing, his words echoing a memo circulated among officers, reported by the New York Times to be from the PBA, and stating the NYPD would now be a 'wartime police department.'

Ramos's funeral is now scheduled for Saturday and the family will have a viewing Friday in Glendale, Queens. Family members of Liu are arriving from China, and his services have not been announced.
