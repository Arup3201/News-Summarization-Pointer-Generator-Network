A 22st mother finally decided to go on a diet - and managed to shed half her body weight - after she found herself unable to leave the house for fear of catching a glimpse of herself in a mirror.

Joanne Sanderson, 30, was too scared to leave her home in case she caught a glimpse of herself reflected in windows or shop mirrors.

She put on weight after giving birth to twin boys in 2002 and spent years eating fried breakfasts and takeaway curries.

Super slimmer: Joanne Sanderson lost 11 stone - half of her body weight - after she was too ashamed to look at her own reflection in the mirror

What a difference a year makes: Joanne (pictured, left, now, and right at 22st) was unable to shift the weight but she decided to take action when she started suffering panic attacks every time she caught sight of herself in a mirror

Despite years of yo-yo dieting and taking slimming pills she was unable to shift the weight but she decided to take action when she started suffering panic attacks every time she caught sight of herself in a mirror.

The only mirror she kept at home was a tiny 2in wide compact, which she used to apply her make-up every day.

Since embarking on a strict calorie-controlled diet last May she has shed 11 stone - half her body weight - and dropped seven dress sizes from 24 to a svelte size 10.

Joanne, from Winsford, Cheshire, said: 'When I looked in the mirror I would get very upset. I would break into a sweat, shake and become very anxious.

Fear: Joanne, pictured at her wedding in 2009 - the only time she wore a dress in years - was too afraid to leave the house for fear of catching a glimpse of her reflection, so stayed in and ate takeaways

'It was a horrible feeling so I avoided mirrors at all costs. I only had one tiny mirror in my house and didn't look at my reflection when I was out.

'Even though I knew I was big, seeing it sent me into a panic and it meant I couldn't leave my home. It was horrible and I felt really trapped.'

Joanne finally decided to lose weight for good last May after she took her sons swimming and saw just how big she was in the changing room mirrors.

Eventually Joanne did get into the pool and shortly afterwards booked sessions with a personal trainer; within weeks the weight started to fall off.

Changing face: Joanne, pictured, left, in May 2013 and, right, April 2014, hired a personal trainer and adopted a new healthy diet

She said: 'When I first started I was just under 22st. I began doing hour-long sessions at the gym three times a week and the weight started to come off.

'I was losing, on average, about a stone a month.

'Seeing the results spurred me on to keep going and I began working out five days a week.'

The change led Joanne to ditch the takeaways and fry-ups for a healthier diet including lots of fruits and vegetables - and by her 30th birthday last October she had dropped to 13st.

She celebrated by buying her first party dress and wore the frock for a night out in Manchester.

She added: 'Because of my size, the only time I had ever worn a dress was at my wedding.

Happier than ever: She now fits into a size 10, weighs 11st - and finally enjoys clothes shopping

'So to be able to celebrate turning 30 by wearing a pretty dress was amazing.

'It was something I never thought I could do.'

She now fits into a size 10 and weighs 11ST.

Joanne is stunned when friends and family she hasn't seen for a while have no idea who she is.

She added: 'I've had so many people say they can't recognise me. They're amazed at the change.

'I look like a new person and feel like one too.'

Joanne's lifestyle change has encouraged her sons Louis and Conner, both 11, and civil partner Kelly, 25, to adopt exercise and healthier diets.

And the mum has also overcome her fear of her reflection and filled her house with mirrors.

She said: 'I love being able to look in the mirror and feel happy.'
