Tennis legend Novak Djokovic has opened up about his past during a poignant on-camera journey which traces his remarkable journey from war-torn Serbia to world No.1.

However, the Jacob's Creek documentary for the 'Made By' series has plenty of light moments thanks to Djokovic - otherwise known as 'The Joker's' trademark sense of humour .

This is particularly true when the cheeky tennis player attempts to mimic a true blue Aussie accent, in preview footage exlusively obtained by Daily Mail Australia.

'G'day mate, how ya' goin'?' he says, semi-convincingly. 

'Good on ya, fair dinkum, knackers!' he attempts, proceeding to screw his face up and burst out laughing.

Djokovic admits making the nostalgic trip down memory lane for Australia's largest wine brand Jacob's Creek's was among the most emotional missions he'd ever embarked on. 

The seven-times grand slam champion and Australian Open favourite grew up in Belgrade at the height of the Balkan war in the 1990s and hopes the series shows anything is possible.

'There is something deeper in it, some inspiration that moves people who follow sports but also like to see where you come from, what's your background, who you've been shaped by,' he said.

'Most people see you for who you are right now but not many see the background of the story and the development and obviously my particular story there were a lot of things going on.

'It wasn't that ordinary, I would say, with wars and difficult times while growing up.

The global premiere  was held in Melbourne Tuesday night so Australia was the first in the world to see the film series

Of his decision to take part in the series, Djokovic said: ‘I was inspired to partner with Jacob’s Creek. This is also an opportunity of having such a strong partner to represent my story and myself and who I am'

''This series shows all the circumstances, all the past obstacles that I've had to overcome in order to develop and become the world's best tennis player,' said the tennis champion

'This series shows all the circumstances, all the past obstacles that I've had to overcome in order to develop and become the world's best tennis player.

'Obviously inspiring others who one day want to become professional tennis players or athletes, this is something that we will sincerely achieve with this Jacob's Creek series.'

For a man who grew up in a war torn country and has since had to work so tirelessly to reach the top, it has never been easy. 

Yet evidently the 27-year-old has never lost his love of fun.

He has a self-deprecating humour which makes watching his story so endearing. 

'We're going to have a lot of bloopers!' he laughs to the camera, as he prepares to let people see a side of him he hasn't shared before.

The film gives a sweet insight into his true nature, capturing him as he mucks around the film crew, does tricks with his racquet, sings care-freely and using his tennis racquet as a guitar.

At first, Djokovic's attempt to mimic the Australian accent is semi-convincing, but it quickly goes south!

However, there was a very serious and important reason that Djokovic decided to embark on the project with Jacob's Creek. 

He is hoping to inspire a whole new generation of tennis players by returning to his humble hometown and showing just how far he has come. 

It meant Djokovic had to face some tough memories and counts returning to the home of his first-ever coach, the late Jelena Gencic, who discovered Djokovic at age six, as a particularly moving experience.

Djokovic credited the Gencic, who also coached Monica Seles and Goran Ivanisevic, for teaching him 'everything I know' after her passing during the 2013 French Open.

'Going back to Jelena's house, obviously where I spent a lot of time when I was younger, and not having her there as my host was not easy for me to experience. It felt a bit strange,' Djokovic said before the series release on Tuesday night.

'So making this film series was emotional and there were some tough moments, but generally it was a very positive experience,' said Djokovic of the Jacob's Creek series

'But I retain the best memories that I could have and I always remember her with a smile and she was one of the most important people in my life.

'So making this film series was emotional and there were some tough moments, but generally it was a very positive experience.' 

Djokovic, 27, said it was an honour to be chosen for the series following the great success of a similar production featuring former world No.1 and four-time Australian Open champion Andre Agassi.

The Serb has the chance to surpass Roger Federer's and Agassi's joint open-era record with a fifth crown at Melbourne Park.

You can watch the films live on the Jacob's Creek 'Made By' website.
