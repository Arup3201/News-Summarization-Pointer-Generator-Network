Aged just 18, Status Quo frontman Francis Rossi waited nervously before the band played on Top of the Pops in 1968.

The band's single Pictures of Matchstick Men had gone to number seven and the broadcast would be their first big break into TV - but as he stood there, he was approached by the presenter Jimmy Savile, who has since been exposed as a serial sex abuser.

To his shock, Savile invited him to his dressing room, saying: 'Come and see me tarts.'

'Dodgy': BBC producers had doubts about employing Jimmy Savile in the early 60s for Top of The Pops. Here he is presenting the show in 1962

Rossi told the Mirror of the shock and revulsion he felt at the DJ's proposal.

The pervert continued: 'Come here later on because there's going to be something. Come and see me tarts, some f****** tarts we have got in.'

Rossi, who had recently married, said he told Savile to 'get out of it'.

Status Quo appeared on the show a number of times with hits including Rocking All Over The World and Whatever You Want, but the band kept their distance from the presenter because he was 'very odd' and there were rumours about his behaviour even then.

Parents would drop their daughters off at Top of the Pops studio, added Rossi, pointing out that 'the world was very different back then'.

Rossi believes there is more scandal to emerge as the numerous investigations continue.

The frontman added: 'I keep hearing "how did he cover it up for so long?" I heard he paid a lot of people off.

'But where did he get the money? I think
 there is a lot to come out about it... Everybody heard stuff about him 
but nobody saw anything.'

There were also rumours about the 'Leeds Mafia', who would intimidate anyone who spoke out about his vile deeds.

Rossi said he recently received a text from fellow rock star Roy Wood saying it was 'about time they got that b******.'

The grandfather of three admits in the interview that his party lifestyle has been replaced 
by the cosiness of a log fire in his new house and falling asleep in 
front of the TV.

More detail has been emerging over Savile's disgusting behaviour during his years at the BBC, and the seedy goings-on in his dressing room.

Comedian Freddie Starr was arrested over claims he molested a schoolgirl in Savile's BBC dressing room.

Starr denied the allegations, saying he had once rescued two 14-year-old girls after finding them in a room with a man in his late 40s, who he knew liked girls below the age of consent.

Convicted paedophile Gary Glitter was
 also arrested and questioned over allegations he and Savile pursued 
their sordid fantasies together.

A video has emerged of a moment when Savile got away with groping a petrified teenager live on Top of the Pops.

Sylvia Edwards can be seen sitting next to Savile as 
he announces the next song to viewers, surrounded by teenage girls.

Then a horrified Sylvia leaps off her seat, shrieks and tries  to move 
away from smirking Savile, who calmly talks into the camera.

The presenter grins as he puts his hand up her skirt, tries to grab her 
bottom and fondles her as she looks distressed  and attempts to wriggle 
free.

Savile went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter for 20 years and returned for the final edition of the weekly show in 2006

Paul Jackson, producer of hit shows Red Dwarf and The Young Ones, said BBC entertainment producers initially rejected Savile for the Top of the Pops jobs because he was 'dodgy'.

Savile's background as a club DJ and manager sparked initial concerns among the show's bosses in the early 1960s, but he went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter for 20 years.

Mr Jackson witnessed at first hand the heady mix of frenzied fans and sexual freedom which characterised the broadcasting and music industries in the 1960s and said attitudes had clearly changed since then.

'I was around at the BBC during the 1960s because of my dad. It was a different time. It wasn't now. The commissioners were fighting to keep the girls out of the dressing rooms,' Jackson said.

A former Yorkshire committee member of the Royal Variety Club of Great Britain has also revealed that he was strongly opposed to Savile having anything to do with the charity in the 1980s and 1990s, because of his background in clubs and 'reputation for entertaining young girls'.
