Everywhere Brendan Rodgers turned he was confronted by evidence of how success can happen when it is least expected.

From the image of Luis Garcia lofting a ball over a tumbling John Terry, the Olympiacos pennant hanging in a cabinet to, above all, the Champions League trophy glistening proudly in a cabinet outside Anfield’s trophy room, the spirit of Istanbul abounded.

When you factor in that Rodgers was holding court on the 10th anniversary of the goal Steven Gerrard scored against the Greek club that launched them on the way to their fifth European Cup, Liverpool’s manager could have not been in a better place if he was looking for omens.

Expected starting line-ups for Tuesday's game

Rodgers enjoys daring to dream and, in some part of his mind, he believes that a victory against FC Basle on Tuesday evening has the capacity to propel Liverpool on another giddy European adventure: what happened in 2004-05 shows how strange things can happen.

For all that Rodgers is prepared to embrace fantasy, though, he also deals in realism and if Liverpool are to preserve their place in this competition, history will have nothing to do with it. What he needs is a display full of vibrancy to show why they deserve a place among the elite.

So far, this Champions League campaign has been hugely anti-climatic; a scruffy win on Match-day One against Ludogorets was followed by three consecutive defeats before a grinding 2-2 draw in Sofia provided a shot at redemption. Rodgers knows Liverpool have to deliver.

‘Once you get through the group stage anything can happen,’ said the manager. ‘I know come February, when the Champions League starts again, we will be a better team because of the players we will have available if we manage to get through. That is what I am looking forward to.

‘We have seen that the best team doesn’t always win the competition. You can get a good draw, a bit of luck. But first things first, we need to get through. This would give the players a huge amount of confidence, having not consistently played that well all season. The key is to get a big win.

‘It may not come with a big performance but the main objective is the win. Get that and we have seen over the years that qualification gives you confidence. We’ve had big performances in my time and want to deliver another to give us that platform.’

The Reds need to beat Basle at Anfield to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League

6 - Liverpool have gone six Champions League games without a clean sheet - their longest run since conceding in eight straight games in the 2008-09 season.

The topic of failure has not been broached in the dressing room. Fail to beat Basle - who only need a point - and the second half of the campaign will look even more onerous, with a schedule of playing on Thursdays and Sundays.

‘If you end up in the Europa League, you are still in European football even if it is not the competition you want to be in,’ Rodgers argued. ‘That is what comes with it but for me the focus is on winning this game. The consequences of that will come after it.

‘I haven’t given the Europa League a second’s thought, to be honest. We qualified for this great competition, deservedly with our level of performance, and now we’re here we want to do well in it. We saw ourselves as a team that can get out of the group and nothing has changed.’

WHAT LIVERPOOL NEED TO DO:

Only a win at Anfield on Tuesday night will do in order for the Reds to progress. 

That message was shared by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. While it was not as forthright as the speech Gerrard gave 10 years ago - ‘I don’t want to be waking up in the UEFA Cup’ - Mignolet is not contemplating Liverpool capsizing at this particular hurdle.

‘We have to do the job in hand and look at ourselves,’ said Mignolet. ‘We have to be ready. Nobody is thinking about not getting through. The only thing that matters is getting the result we need.’

Do not think, however, this will be a night when Liverpool have things all their own way. Rodgers spoke at length about what the emotion and atmosphere inside the stadium will do for his players but that is not to say it will overpower their rivals.

Basle boss Paulo Sousa says they plan to put Liverpool under pressure in their crunch Champions League tie

Basle exposed Liverpool’s soft underbelly in October when they met and Paulo Sousa, their urbane Portuguese coach, believes the pressure that will be on Rodgers and his players can be exploited. The message he will convey is that Liverpool are vulnerable.

‘We will put them more under pressure and hopefully we can have another magical night where the performance will be outstanding and the result will be in our favour,’ said Sousa, who ruled out any idea that Basle are coming to defend.

‘I am always looking for a win. It is something we keep working on. In my leadership and feedback to the players it is always playing to win. We have a game-plan, hopefully it is the correct one.’
