After spending more than £2,000 on a dream five-star African honeymoon, newlyweds Adam and Sarah Monk planned to toast their marriage in the lap of luxury.

But when the couple from Stowmarket in Suffolk arrived at the resort on Gambia's Atlantic coast they were met with dirty curtains, a stained toilet, a broken shower, loose wiring and single beds.

The Monks were so distraught they flew home after just two nights.

Honeymoon from hell: Adam and Sarah Monk from Suffolk  jetted off to Gambia after marrying in March

Honeymoon suite: The newlyweds were given twin beds to sleep in

Dirty: The couple had to contend with a mouldy curtain and chipped tiles in the bathroom

Printing company manager Adam, 31 and receptionist Sarah, 27, jetted off on honeymoon in March after tying the knot in front of 40 close friends and family.

They'd spent £2,000 on the trip, which included flights, vaccinations and malaria tablets and a honeymoon package at the  Laico Atlantic Banjul Hotel, which included fresh fruit and sparkling wine upon their arrival.

But when they arrived they were devastated to discover there was no five-star reception and their honeymoon suite had two single beds.

Their disappointment grew as they looked around to discover dirty curtains, loose plug sockets, a stained toilet seat and a faulty air-conditioning unit held together with just masking tape.

A broken shower head meant that they had to stand in the corner of the bathroom to have any chance to getting under the water.

When they left the room for the solace of the beach they claim they were hassled endlessly by staff members touting for business.

Mr Monk said: 'We were expecting rest and relaxation but at every turn someone was trying to hassle us for money - you had to hold on tight to your bags otherwise staff would carry them for you and then demand a cash tip.

'We were looking forwards to a lovely romantic break and I did not expect to be spending the first night of our honeymoon comforting my crying wife. It was a complete nightmare.

'After such a wonderful wedding day and looking forward to a great honeymoon for such a long time, all we were left with was bad memories which tainted the whole wedding experience.

'It was a very expensive holiday for us but it was so upsetting because what we got was far from what we were promised - it was certainly anything but relaxing.'

Five-star: Adam and Sarah Monk's experience was far from the luxury advertised on the hotel's website

The Laico Atlantic Resort: Adam and Sarah claim they were hassled by pushy and aggressive staff at the resort

The couple said the pushy approach from staff made them feel intimidated and with no sign of their holiday rep at the resort they were left feeling isolated.

Deciding a change of room would not be enough to end their ordeal, they took the massive decision to book flights home instead, after just one night, at a cost of an extra £600.

They jetted out of Gambia the following day - meaning their honeymoon had lasted just two full days.

Mr Monk said: 'Even though our trip was so short, we felt a massive sense of relief to be heading home from the nightmare.'

Their nightmare ordeal was far from finished though as, following a night in the airport hotel, they then had to catch three separate coaches and spent almost 10 hours getting back to Suffolk - more than 200 miles away.

Incredibly the couple have been told they cannot claim a refund from operator Thomas Cook, because they didn't register an official complaint during their short stay in Gambia.

Wedded bliss: The couple are now planning a second honeymoon, in the UK

A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: 'We urge all customers to make contact with us while in resort if they have any concerns about their hotel or holiday/honeymoon arrangements, as we have a dedicated team of representatives on hand to offer immediate assistance.

'Regrettably Mr and Mrs Monk did not give us an opportunity to help on this occasion.'

Mr Monk said: 'When you look through the small print, there is a line about registering complaints whilst on the holiday but the last thing you are thinking about when you book your honeymoon months in advance is about it being a nightmare and having to complain.

'The fact that our honeymoon was ruined was one thing but the attitude of Thomas Cook about putting it right for us has been a complete shock.

'We did not want anything more than our money back - we are not asking for any compensation but they just don't want to take responsibility for it and their attitude has bordered on hostile - they are concentrating on finding the loopholes to get out of paying us anything rather than trying to make things right.'

His bride Sarah added: 'I was in tears, floods of tears - it was just not what we had expected or the relaxing experience we have been told about when we booked it.

'It was just absolutely awful - I did not want to be there and just wanted to get home.

'It was not what a bride would expect on the first night of a honeymoon - I think the room was the low point, it's not where you spend the whole time but I think it's an important part of the honeymoon.

'To have it in that condition, in sweltering heat and the air conditioning unit not working, it was terrible.'

The couple are now planning a second honeymoon but will stay in the UK this time, with a trip to Devon or Cornwall on the cards.

Mr Monk added: 'Luckily, when we got back, the weather at home was nice so we managed to have an enjoyable week off work but we could not stop thinking about how we should have been enjoying our honeymoon.

'It has been embarrassing and upsetting when our wedding guests, who kindly donated cash towards the honeymoon, have been asking us how the trip was and we have to tell them about how it all went so badly wrong.'
