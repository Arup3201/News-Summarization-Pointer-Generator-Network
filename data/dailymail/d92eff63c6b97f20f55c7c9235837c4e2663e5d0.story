The parents of Baby Lisa have said they are still hopeful the little girl will be returned to them - two years after she vanished from their Missouri home in the middle of the night.

Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, who will hold a candle-lit vigil on Saturday to mark two years since the disappearance, have also worked with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to release an image of what Lisa could look like now, in the hope it will reinvigorate the case.

Despite the family's determination, authorities in Kansas City said tips into the disappearance have waned since the months after she vanished on October 4, 2011.

Missing: Lisa Irwin was just 10 months old when she vanished from her parents' home in Kansas City in 2011 - and two years on her family has not given up home. Right, how she could look today

'I cannot force the people who know where
Lisa is and who might have her into telling us. I have no control over 
that,' Bradley told the Kansas City Star.

'You do what you can for your baby, because it is 
your job as a parent to protect your child, and I wasnâ€™t able to protect
her from the bad guys.'

Lisa was 10-months-old when her father returned from a late work shift to find the front door open, the lights on, Bradley asleep, his daughter's bedroom window open and her crib empty.

They believe that someone broke into the home and snatched the baby while Bradley slept, and have said they think someone is bringing up the little girl as their own.

Heartbroken: Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, pictured after her disappearance, believe she was taken so that someone else could bring her up as their own. They are holding a candle-lit vigil on Saturday

Scene: They say she was taken in the middle of the night from their home while Bradley slept in October 2011

'When
somebody abducts an infant, they don't take them to hurt them,' she 
said. 'Wherever she is, she is being loved and taken well care of, 
because they went through a hell of a lot of trouble to get her.'

She said that she knows people have pointed fingers at them for the disappearance but she maintained their innocence - and said it will be proven when the little girl returns to them.

A private investigator continues to work on the case, and the family still offers a $100,000 reward for anyone who has information that could bring the baby home.

Bradley said she still hands over tips she receives to the police.

Have you seen her? Police said they now receive about one tip a week in the case of the missing baby

Where is she? Lisa's parents have also offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to her return

In the first year after the disappearance, detectives received more than 1,600 tips and many were checked twice. Now the tips have slowed down and authorities receive about one a week.

The family and their supporters will hold a prayer vigil at 7pm on Saturday at their home.

John Picerno, the couple's attorney, said they are 'very pleased' with the newly-released age progression photo.

'The investigation continues, and even though the leads have slowed, we have not given up hope,' he told KCTV5.
