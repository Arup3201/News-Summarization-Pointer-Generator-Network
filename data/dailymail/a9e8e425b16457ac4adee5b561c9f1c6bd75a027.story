Ambulance delays of up to half an hour, well outside the eight minute benchmark, have seen three people dead in Sydney in the past month.

The Sydney Morning Herald reports the NSW ambulance service have blamed surges in demand for the increased waiting times, while frustrated paramedics are being forced to wait to off-load patients at Sydney's busy emergency departments.

The auditor general also found that 18 ambulances are seen to get 'lost' each day due to hospital delays, a big jump from six in 2005.

Blackheath hospital wardsman, Brad Jones, 54, suffered a heart attack, after choking on a piece of food, at his home last month and his 90 year old mother was forced to administer CPR for more than 30 minutes before paramedics arrived.

When they finally got there, they were unable to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead.

There was another incident in Hornsby last month, when it took an ambulance 25 minutes to reach a patient that had trouble breathing, who was taken to hospital but later died.

A third man, suffering chest pains, also had to wait half an hour for an ambulance to arrive at his south western Sydney home at Minto Heights, but it was too late and paramedics arrived to the man dead.

The NSW ambulance service have blamed surges in demand for the increased waiting times. Three people have died in Sydney in the past month due to waiting at least half an hour for paramedics to arrive

The president of the Australian Paramedics Association, Wayne Flint, said it was the responsibility of the NSW government to take action to 'commit cash and (paramedics)'

Health Services Union NSW secretary, Gerard Hayes told the Daily Telegraph there has been constant under-resources of paramedics for a number of years and it has only got worse.

'This is compounded by trolley block, where the lack of resources at emergency wards means crews are forced to wait to hand over patients,' he said.

He described the worst hospitals in Sydney as Liverpool, Westmead and the Royal Prince Alfred.

Health minister Jillian Skinner has offered her sincere condolences to the families of these patients.

'These incidents are being thoroughly investigated,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald. 

The president of the Australian Paramedics Association, Wayne Flint, said it was the responsibility of the NSW government to take action to 'commit cash and (paramedics)'.

The auditor general also found that 18 ambulances are seen to get 'lost' each day due to hospital delays, a big jump from six in 2005

It follows heightened concerns last week that an ambulance took way too long to reach felled cricketer Phillip Hughes at the Sydney cricket ground when he collapsed after a bouncer and died days later.

The first dispatched NSW ambulance didn't arrive for more than 20 minutes and a second ambulance took almost double the response time expected after called.

Medical experts say the delay in care could have been critical to his chances of survival.
