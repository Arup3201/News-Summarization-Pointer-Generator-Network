British forces successfully dropped a second batch of aid to thousands of trapped refugees in northern Iraq last night – 24 hours after being forced to abandon an attempt because there were too many people crowding on the ground.

The RAF was able to deliver ‘essential supplies’ over Mount Sinjar to assist the Yazidis, who have fled rampaging ISIS forces sweeping through the north of the country.

On Sunday night, RAF forces aborted an attempt to deliver aid to the location in northern Iraq at the last minute. It meant that Britain had managed just one successful aid drop took before last night.

Downing Street has also confirmed that the RAF will send ‘a small number’ of Tornado jets to the region so they can be used to improve the UK’s surveillance capability in the region to help the humanitarian effort.

The UK will also look at how it can play a role in getting equipment to Kurdish forces as they are better able to counter the Islamic State (IS), formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis), Number 10 added.

President Barack Obama said the US had ‘stepped up’ its support to Iraqi and Kurdish forces engaged in the fight on the ground and was continuing with its daily humanitarian efforts.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government’s emergency Cobra committee to discuss the crisis yesterday, said the situation was ‘challenging’ and warned of a ‘potential humanitarian disaster on a huge scale’.

The Department for International Development said the UK’s second aid drop included 3,180 reusable water purification containers filled with 15,900 litres of clean water and 816 solar lamps that can also be used to charge mobile phones.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘The humanitarian situation in Iraq area is deeply worrying.

‘Isis terrorists continue to contest towns and villages south of Erbil and in the Sinjar area and the Yazidi community face appalling conditions, cut off on Mount Sinjar.

‘UK aid is already helping the people who desperately need it. Last night the RAF successfully made a second drop of essential supplies, including 3,180 reusable containers filled with clean water.’

An attempt to drop water and safety equipment had to be abandoned on Sunday night because there were too many refugees in the drop zone

British voters narrowly support taking part in air strikes against Islamic State fighters sweeping through northern Iraq slaughtering non-Muslims.

The Government has refused to rule out joining a US military assault to protect civilians fleeing the jihadists - but has insisted its focus is on getting aid to refugees.

But a YouGov poll for the Sun has revealed support for UK troops to bomb the fanatics.

The revelation comes as the RAF geared up to send Tornado jets into Iraq – but only to monitor the humanitarian situation on the ground.

Some 37 per cent of Britons approve of the RAF taking part in air strikes – while 36 per cent disapprove and the remaining 27 per cent saying they don’t know.

Last August 50 per cent of the country was opposed to missile strikes on Syria – with just 25 per cent in support.

One of Britain’s most senior generals accused the ‘commitment-phobic’ Government of being ‘terrified’ of intervening in the Iraq crisis before next year’s general election.

General Sir Richard Shirreff told the Times: ‘The longer we sit on our hands and prevaricate, the more dangerous the situation is going to become’.

But speaking after the Cobra committee meeting yesterday, Mr Hammond rejected calls for Parliament to be recalled to discuss the crisis and said there were no plans for British military involvement.

‘We don’t envisage a combat role at the present time,’ he said.

David Cameron, who is on holiday in Portugal, has been urged to call MPs back from their summer break to discuss the crisis and he has also faced pressure - including from former head of the Army Lord Dannatt - to consider a military intervention.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister was ‘very much engaged’ with the situation despite being abroad and a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’.

But the Prime Minister is facing increasing pressure to join US military action against ISIS forces. 

Tory MP Mark Pritchard said it was time for the UK to take direct military action - through air strikes and drone attacks but not ground forces - and predicted a recalled Commons would vote in favour of the escalation.

'The international community can pour as much aid into the region as its likes,' he wrote for the PoliticsHome website.

'But unless Islamic State fighters are killed and removed from the battlefield, they will go on killing and committing further atrocities.

'The UK must not walk by on the other side and that is why overnight news that RAF Tornadoes are once again going to fly in Iraqi airspace is welcome.

'However, this intervention needs to be in an unequivocal combat role, not just in an intelligence, surveillance and targeting role.'

Inaction at this stage would be 'a greater risk than positive action', he suggested.

He urged the Government to support any effort to secure a United Nations Security Council resolution in support of military action.

A proposed French resolution was too weak and 'in danger of being just another UN platitude whilst toddlers choke on their own blood', he said.

Mr Pritchard said the different circumstances suggested there would be no repeat of MPs' refusal last year to endorse military intervention in Syria.

'I suspect this time Parliament would vote for decisive, precision, and targeted military action in Iraq, with clearly defined rules of engagement.'

Mr Hammond will chair a further Cobra meeting this afternoon, Downing Street said.
