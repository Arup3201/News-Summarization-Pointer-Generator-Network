Sheik Mansour has now spent around £1billion on his Manchester City dream, but if he put every player up for sale this summer he would only be able to recoup £311million in proceeds.

That at least is one debate-provoking conclusion raised by a new report, published today, that assesses the ‘market values’ of players in the squads at the 98 clubs across the top divisions in England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.

City have the most valuable squad in the Premier League according to experts at the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory, who rate player values for summer 2014 by a wide range of ‘objective’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position, performance data and international experience.

High earner: Sergio Aguero is Manchester City's most expensive player, according to the CIES Football Observatory

City’s most valuable player is Sergio Aguero, CIES say, with a market value of £40m, followed by David Silva (£27m) then Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure (both around £24m). The whole squad would make £311.3m if sold at market rates in the transfer window, the report says.

Chelsea have the next most valuable squad who played in the Premier League in 2013-14 at £310.5m, followed by Liverpool (£300.8m), Arsenal (£288.7m) and Manchester United (£220.2m). It should be stressed these are sale values at ‘market rates’ this summer for all the players combined, and not what these clubs paid for those players. In many cases, not least at City, the players cost more than they are now worth.

At the other extreme, Fulham’s squad is worth just £30.6m, or less than any 2013-14 Premier League team, and only slightly less than West Brom’s (£32.3m) and Crystal Palace’s (£33.9m).

Key figure: Vincent Kompany's value is around the £24m mark, says the report

Time to cash in? Unhappy Yaya Toure is  valued at around the £24m mark also

Across Europe, Barcelona’s squad - with the world’s most valuable player Lionel Messi in it - is rated as worth £478.2m while Real Madrid’s, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in the ranks, is worth £393.5m in second place.

Bayern Munich are next (£322.6m) followed by City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal.

The more a squad is worth, the better it performed in the Premier League in 2013-14, by and large. The top four most valuable squads filled the top four places and most clubs finished within a handful of places of what might be expected given their resources.

The two main exceptions were Palace, who finished in 11th place, or seven places higher than their squad ranked 18th in value; and Cardiff, who finished bottom, or six places lower than a squad worth the 14th most in the division.

The top of the tree: With a squad value of £478.2m, Barcelona are the most expensive in Europe

The full report can be bought from the CIES website and the authors say: ‘From an economic perspective, it is worth highlighting results obtained by some of the clubs that were among those that spent the least to sign players fielded such as Crystal Palace in England, Elche in Spain, Guingamp in France, Augsburg in Germany and Verona in Italy. This publication will allow you to understand what factors permitted these clubs to over-perform.’

It cost more than three times as much to assemble, but Manchester City's squad would cost £311m to buy
