Cesc Fabregas' Premier League debut for Chelsea earned him a night out.

The Spanish midfielder was in sensational form to orchestrate the Blues' 3-1 win at Burnley on Monday night, and was spotted at London's trendy Zuma restaurant with team-mates Fernando Torres and Didier Drogba.

Drogba made a return to action in a cameo for Jose Mourinho's side during the win, while Fabregas' compatriot Torres was left on the sidelines.

On the move: Torres is wanted by Roma and may have played his final game for Chelsea 

It may be one of the last meals Torres has with his fellow Chelsea stars, with the £50million misfit now a target for Italian side Roma.

Roma - who now count Stamford Bridge stalwart Ashley Cole among their ranks - could see frontman Mattia Destro move to London as part of any deal for Torres.

Torres has fallen further down the pecking order after the signing of £32million striker Diego Costa, who netted in a promising debut at Turf Moor.
