Another hurricane is heading our way - but rather than battening down the hatches, it might be time to reach for the sunglasses.

Hurricane Cristobal, which is gathering speed in the Bahamas, is forecast to narrowly miss Britain at the end of the week.

Experts say it will drag an area of high pressure behind it, creating a dry, warm and sunny start to September - a welcome relief after the end-of-August washout created spectacular scenes over the Seven Sisters cliffs in Sussex.

The remnants of the last Caribbean storm, Hurricane Bertha, struck the UK a fortnight ago causing dramatic downpours and some flash flooding.

But the tail-end of Cristobal is likely to veer north and miss us, sucking a warm air mass up from Spain and creating at least a few days of dry weather.

It will come as a relief after a sodden Bank Holiday weekend and a bitterly cold week.

Hurricane Cristobal, which last night whipped across the Caribbean at 75mph and dumped 4 inches (10cm) of rain on Bermuda, is expected to move up the east coast of the United States before hurtling across the Atlantic.

Though showing a similar path to ex-Hurricane Bertha which caused havoc at the beginning of August, it is not expected to have anywhere near the same impact on Britain’s weather when it arrives at the weekend.

According to America’s National Hurricane Centre, Cristobal will weaken to a storm as it moves towards Europe on Sunday.

Idyll: The Met Office said after a generally unsettled picture this week the hurricane's tail could trigger more wind and rain in some regions in the north

Unlike Bertha, which tracked right across the UK, the remnants of Cristobal are unlikely to hit the country directly but instead veer to the north.

The Met Office said after a generally unsettled picture this week it could trigger more wind and rain in some regions.

Forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘We might see a bit of wind and rain in the northwest from the remnants of Cristobal on Sunday and it might get a bit breezy.

‘For many places Cristobal could bring some decent weather at the weekend by dragging high pressure towards the UK.’

MeteoGroup 
spokesman Billy Payne added: ‘The latest model is that the tail-end of 
the storm will go to the north of Britain on Monday over Iceland and 
Scandinavia.

‘Following behind will be a region of high pressure. It will be dryer and more settled than we have seen recently.

‘That
 is likely to last through the middle and maybe the late part of next 
week, when it looks sunny and dry for many, with temperatures in the low
 20s.’

Hurricane Cristobal has already caused at least five deaths in the Caribbean islands, officials said.

The US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said the hurricane would likely avoid a collision with the US Eastern Seaboard, but it was creating dangerous surf and rip conditions off the coast.

The Turks and Caicos cancelled flights after the hurricane dumped 12 inches (30cm) of rain on the islands over the weekend.

Some 640 families in Haiti have been left homeless during the passage of the storm.

Ominous: This funnel cloud appeared above caravans in Dymchurch, Kent

Holidaymakers were treated to another sign that summer could be over - a sinister-looking funnel cloud in grey skies above the seaside.

The ominous shape formed yesterday above Dymchurch, Kent, on Tuesday after days of heavy rain.

Described as a 'funnel cloud' because its base did not touch the ground, it forms when a combination of high winds and high humidity causes condensed water vapour to spin in a vortex.

It was caught on camera by Stevie McGarrigle, who was on holiday with his two children and was stunned to see the mini storms circling above their caravan.

Stevie, 39, a gardener from south east London, said: 'It had been raining for the past few days and I was just sitting outside when these mini twisters started to form.

'There were a few just sprouting up and then breaking away. It was amazing. I have never seen anything like it in my life.

'At first we were a bit scared because we thought on big one could form. I mean it was really windy and the trees were getting hammered.

'Then all of a sudden they just broke up and went away.'
