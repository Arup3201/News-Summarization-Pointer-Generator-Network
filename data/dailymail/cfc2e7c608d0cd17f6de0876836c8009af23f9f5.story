A Melbourne man has been reunited with his brother’s World War II medals, three years after they were stolen.

82-year-old Noel Edwards was shocked when he received a call from Sergeant Brendan Dowling, from Heidelberg Police Station, claiming they had unearthed his brother William Leslie Edwards’ precious medals.

The four medals had been gathering dust at the police station for the past three years, since they were confiscated from a burglar who claimed he forgot where he had taken them from.

The 1939-1945 Star, The Pacific Star, the 1939-45 War Medal and the 1939-1945 Australian Service Medal were all awarded to William Leslie for his time spent fighting in World War II.

His hard work led him to Noel Edwards, William’s youngest brother, who is still living in Melbourne.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Sergeant Brendan Dowling said he wanted to make sure the medals were returned to the right family.

He followed many lines of enquiries, including national libraries, Ancestory.com and even random phone calls.

Mr Edwards said that he will be showing the medals to his granddaughter and is looking forward to telling her stories of his brother

‘It was certainly a happy ending,’ Sgt Dowling said.

Mr Edwards was reunited with his brother, William Leslie Edwards’, medals on Tuesday in a ceremony at Heidelberg Police Station.

Sgt Dowling said it was an emotional affair for Mr Edwards.

He said it brought back many memories for Mr Dowling of his brothers and his mother.

He searched through archives, libraries and made random phone calls 

Mr Edwards was the only one out of five brothers who didn’t serve in the war.

William Leslie Edwards, whom family members affectionately dubbed “Mick”, grew up in North Fitzroy and served in the 2/3 Ordnance Store Company.

He spent the remainder of his deployment serving as a prisoner of war in Changii prison and passed away in 1981.

Mr Edwards said he was thrilled with the happy news and said he looked forward to showing the medals to his granddaughter.

“It’s an amazing feeling to get these medals back and I take my hat off to Sergeant Dowling,” Mr Edwards said. “If anyone deserves a medal, he does.” 

His investigation work led him to a death certificate of William Leslie Edwards. He was then able to locate William's remaining family members
