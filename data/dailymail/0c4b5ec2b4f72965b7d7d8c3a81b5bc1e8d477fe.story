Her superstar father - and the circumstance of her birth - made her famous before she could even walk.

But last night 14-year-old Anna Ermakova stepped out of Boris Becker's shadow and on to the catwalk as she appeared at Berlin Fashion Week.

The tennis star's  lovechild was conceived during a scandalous, short-lived and much disputed encounter at the London outpost of celebrity haunt Nobu in 1999.

Her mother Angela Ermakova initially claimed the liaison took place in a store cupboard but Becker later confessed they had made love on a staircase between two bathrooms.

Anna wore a pewter mini dress for her runway debut, walking for German designer Riani accompanied by a giant white poodle. 

Exuding easy confidence, it seemed hard to believe that it was the teenager's modelling debut.

She was recently signed to Mega Modelling Agency and as her profile states, her height - she is 5ft 10 - and striking features have got her noticed among talent hawks despite her youth. 

Now she says she has a 'mind of my own' and is only allowed to pursue her dream of a modelling career 'because I am doing so well at school.'

After being allowed to open and close the show for Riani she told German newspaper Bild: 'This is an absolute dream which has come true for me. All my girlfriends dream about such a chance. Everything went incredibly quickly for me.'

Of course, she said she knows that it is a fact that her name opens doors, adding; 'Yes, but I cannot make myself unknown.' 

Boris acknowledged Anna was his child in February 2001 and obtained joint custody of his daughter in November 2007 (pictured together when Anna was younger) 

Proud father Boris posted this Tweet to his 586,000 followers with a link to a picture of Anna on the catwalk 

Boris captioned the picture of his daughter 'What a beautiful young lady #Anna #family #Berlin #mbfw' 

Boris went on Twitter shortly after her debut to express his pride in her and Anna admitted that her mother, 47, whom she lives with in London, is equally proud of her and accompanied her to Berlin from the home they share in London.

Though she has inherited her father's ginger hair and his distinctive features, it seems she has followed in her mother's footsteps when it comes to her career.

She starred in German label Riani's autumn/winter 2015 show on Tuesday, modelling a series of dresses for the brand before walking the catwalk with Riani designers Ulrich Schulte and Isi Degel. 

Anna went on: 'It isn't it about the money. I also do not consider myself as a professional. It's a small beginning of something that I want to try.'

Ted Linow, her agent at Mega Models, refused to discuss her earnings saying: 'No models talk about that.'

Asked if 14 was a little early to start work, she said: 'My mother is, naturally, always with me and I want it that way. That's what I'm doing here, an excursion into a new world, which I really love. I really never expected to cause such a frenzy.'

While 14-year-old Anna looked stunning in a silver dress, the giant poodle was not explained 

Anna paused to 'pet' the poodle at the end of the runway before allowing it to walk on ahead of her 

In another interview with German glossy magazine Gala, Anna insisted: 'I am not a child any more and I believe modelling is the key to bringing me further along in life, perhaps even as a full-time career.

I think people probably have other things to interest them other than my name - I'm seeking to simply be myself.'

Boris, a five-time Wimbledon winner and currently the coach of world number one Novak Djokovic, had initially denied that Anna was his daughter.

But after a DNA test in DNA test in February 2001 proved he was the father, he agreed to support Anna and obtained joint custody in November 2007

The 'five second' romp not only produced a daughter, but cost Becker his marriage to Barbara, with whom he has two sons. The divorce settlement came in at £20million.

The German star has previously spoken of his 'guilt and shame' over the quickie which happened just after he announced his retirement.

Despite the high price he paid for the brief encounter, he claims he now loves the daughter who he initially doubted was his.

He said: 'I live and learn. It cost my marriage, it cost for the next couple of years my private life but having Anna is not a mistake any more. I have a beautiful daughter. I love her very much.'

Despite the publicity and scandal surrounding her conception, Anna has managed to remain largely out of the spotlight during her childhood. 

Despite this being her first ever appearance on the catwalk, Anna seemed very confident

According to Anna, she likes playing soccer in her spare time and is a visitor to a private London gym. And the report said that in her life her mother is an 'omnipresent' figure.

But Anna insists: 'My mother neither dominates nor manipulates me. I have my own mind. Nevertheless, I want my mother to be more of a girlfriend.'

Angela said that as Anna grows she realises she will have to step back from her life, adding: 'Every small ship must sometime sail off alone in the open sea.'

Born in 1967 in Leimen, West Germany, Boris became a professional tennis playing in 1984 at the age of 17.

He caused a storm in the sport when, as an unseeded adolescent he became the youngest player to ever win the Wimbledon men's final.

In the course of his career he won a total of 49 singles and 15 doubles titles including three wins at Wimbledon, reaching the iconic final seven times in 10 years.

Becker married his first wife Barbara Feltus in Decemeber 1993 and the couple went on to have two sons together; Noah, born on January 18, 1994, and Elias, born on September 4, 1999.

However in the summer of 1999, having just retired from tennis, Boris had his now much publicised trist with model Angela Ermakova at Nobu in London.

When his wife Barbara found out about the one night stand - which occured while she was pregnant with their second child- she moved to Florida and filed for divorce. She fought their pre-nuptual agreement and managed to win £14,400,000 and the custody of both sons in divorce court.

Boris has since said during the argument in which he confessed his infidelity, Barbara struck him.  

The one night stand also resulted in Angela becoming pregnant.

Although Boris disputed paternity for months - even suggesting in a German paper that Angela, working for the Russia government- had stolen his sperm and impregnated herself.

His daughter Anna was born on 22 March 2000

A DNA test in February 2001 proved Boris was the father and he agreed to support Anna and obtained joint custody in November 2007.

During this period Boris also had a firey on-again-off-again relationship with German rap singer Sabrina Setlur, as well as breifly becoming engaged to to Alessandra Meyer-Wölden

Moving to Switzerland and enjoying a few years less in the media spotlight, Becker remarried in 12 June 2009 in St Moritz, Switzerland to Dutch model Sharlely Lilly Kerssenberg

The couple have a three-year-old son named Amadeus Benedict Edley Luis Becker.
