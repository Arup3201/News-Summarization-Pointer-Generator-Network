Target: Lauren Silverman has made a steady rise up the social ladder

To borrow the vernacular of the high-powered Wall Street banking circles in which she now moves, Lauren Silverman bears the look of someone who has ‘bagged the elephant’.

After all, the prospect of being the mother to Simon Cowell’s first child will, one imagines, open many doors in the glitzy social strata she has made it her business to frequent, not to mention access to the X Factor mogul’s £225million fortune.

Certainly Florida-born Lauren gives every indication of knowing exactly where she is going: Upwards. Friends in the US describe her as ‘determined and ambitious’.

Which, depending on whom you believe, could be a euphemism for a gold digger who’ll let nothing and nobody stop her rise to notoriety and money.

Whatever the case, there are a couple of spanners in the works. Last night sources close to Cowell were making it plain that he has no intention of marrying her.

One of his friends said: ‘Simon and Lauren are in a relationship, they are very happy – she’s been good for him. They are a couple and Simon will just pay for their child. He will step up and be a part of the life of the child… but Simon is saying privately that he has absolutely no plans to marry Lauren.’

Then there is the small matter of the fact she is still married to her banker and property developer husband of ten years, Andrew Silverman.

But not for much longer. A furious Silverman has filed divorce papers in New York which name Cowell as her lover and accuse his wife of ‘cruel and inhuman treatment’.

The prospect of an imminent divorce is, no doubt, a relief to 37-year-old Mr Silverman’s highly respectable and wealthy parents, 
Eleonora and Allen. They were said to be so aghast at their son’s choice
of bride that they refused to attend the wedding in 2003 in the 
fabulously elegant old-money confines of the St Regis hotel in 
Manhattan’s Midtown.

‘Andrew’s parents did not approve of who she was,’ a source close to the Silvermans said last night.Allen Silverman is a chief executive officer of the family’s New York-based Andalex Group property company.

His
company literature says he has ‘instilled his strong family values and 
unimpeachable standards’ in his sons Andrew and Alexander. Sources close
to the family say it was just these morals that lay behind their 
suspicion of Lauren.

So what was it about Lauren that put 
this well-to-do family’s teeth on edge? In a word, money. She seems to 
have revelled in it, and the access to high society it brought her. But 
undeterred by her in-laws’ disapproval, Lauren – who has a 
seven-year-old son, Adam, with Silverman – continued her rise through 
the ranks of New York’s wealthy and connected.

Fears:
Simon Cowell could be forced to reveal financial details of his life in
his pregnant lover Lauren Silverman's divorce battle with her estranged
husband Andrew

She was brought up in comfortable, upper-middle-class surroundings. Her father, Steven Davis, 61, is an accountant, who lives with his new wife, Rosy, in Florida. Lauren’s mother is Carole Davis, 60, an estate agent who has also remarried.

A rapid social climb such as Lauren’s is likely to rub some people up the wrong way. At the apartment on New York’s exclusive Upper East Side where she lived with Silverman until she moved out last month, she was, by all accounts, far from popular.

Yesterday, one well-heeled neighbour dismissively described her as ‘a diva princess since she met Andrew’. Another resident at the £4million high-rise reportedly hissed: ‘She is the troublemaker. She is very insecure.’

Lauren’s mother Carole jumped to her defence yesterday, saying: ‘She’s a nice girl. Things happen in life. Her marriage was not a marriage made in heaven. My daughter is a wonderful girl and a wonderful mother.’

She spoke out after claims emerged that her daughter has already allegedly issued Cowell with a string of demands, telling him she wants marriage, her own reality TV show and – oddly – a house in the Cotswolds before she will allow him access to the child.

More than just friends? Reports claim the couple's romance has been going on since at least 2012. Her husband believed the romance started in the spring

Certainly, for all her soon-to-be ex-husband’s wealth – though significantly it is Andrew’s father who owns the Manhattan flat where the couple lived – it is clear Cowell is another large step up the financial ladder.

Lauren grew up in a smart but less than grand £650,000 family home in suburban Hallandale Beach, Florida, and attended Miami Country Day School, which is private and costs £19,000 a year.

Her desire to get on is, seemingly, in the genes. For several years her mother has taken a three-month summer rental on a seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in the upmarket enclave of Bridgehampton, in New York state. Lauren is currently holidaying there with her son.

The Hamptons, where the likes of Sir Paul McCartney have homes, has given the Davis clan access to rich neighbours – rather higher society than the daughter of an accountant and estate agent might be expected to inhabit.

What is confusing many of their friends is just how Silverman was able, apparently, to be so blind about the emerging relationship between his wife and Cowell.

It was Andrew Silverman who introduced Cowell to her in 2006 at the Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados, where the 53-year-old music mogul spends every New Year, and the three struck up an instant friendship.

In January 2012, Lauren and Andrew were photographed aboard Slipstream, the yacht Cowell rents for his twice-yearly holidays. Then in August 2012 Lauren joined Cowell on Slipstream again with his harem of women, including Lauren’s best friend, fashion designer Rachel Roy, and Cowell’s ex, the singer Sinitta, in St Tropez.

As they were: It appears that the divorce battle between Lauren and Andrew could turn into an ugly one

And a few months ago, Lauren posted photos of herself in a bikini on the yacht during another trip off St Bart’s in January.

Yesterday, a close friend of Lauren’s blamed the breakdown of her marriage and her growing closeness to Cowell on her husband frequently travelling abroad for business. Mzia Shiman, who has known her for ten years, said Silverman and the pop mogul had been best friends for years but that their feelings for each other had only recently changed.

‘They were close friends and then one day it turned into something else,’ said Shiman. ‘Lauren didn’t plan any of this. It’s not some kind of trick. I know one thing for sure, they are in love with each other. I hope they will get married and be happy for ever.’

Shiman, who owns a day spa in Manhattan, said she saw Silverman a week ago. ‘She told me she was pregnant with Simon’s baby. She was glowing.

‘I said, “Lauren, are you happy?” and she said, “Yes, I’m thrilled”. She told me Simon is happy to have a child. She was a little bit stressed, of course, because it’s a difficult situation. But she is in love and she is happy.’

Shiman says her friend is different from the other women Cowell surrounds himself with. ‘Lauren never took anything from Simon, she never expected anything. I think that’s why, for Simon, Lauren is special,’ she said.

‘Women have always been jealous of her. She’s beautiful, she’s married to a millionaire. She has a driver, and a house here [in New York] and in the Hamptons. Andrew is a rich man and she is used to this life.’

Shiman added that her friend will be a ‘wonderful mother’ to Cowell’s baby.

Be that as it may, only days before she conceived Cowell’s child he was still denying their relationship even existed. Two months ago, Cowell instructed his high-profile US attorney, Marty Singer, to issue a forceful statement to an American celebrity blogger denying a relationship.

Singer wrote: ‘Any implication or statement that my client is engaged in adultery and has allegedly broken up the marriage of Ms Silverman is not only false but reckless.’

He added: ‘Stating my client’s relationship with Lauren Silverman has become more serious such that she is now getting a divorce so that Simon and she can be together ... is false and defamatory.’

All of which now makes Cowell look a bit silly. One thing that’s for sure, however, is that he will have his hands full with his social climbing and fiercely ambitious pregnant lover.
