It's fair to say that footballers and their Wags are not known for their good taste.

But even by their standards, the home of West Ham’s Andy Carroll and his fiancee Billi Mucklow, formerly of ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex, takes interior decoration to previously unknown levels.

Fans yesterday mocked the £85,000-a-week, pony-tailed footballer after he and Miss Mucklow, 26, posted pictures of their new Essex mansion, which has been dubbed Carroll Castle, on social media.

'Classy': Billi Mucklow and Andy Carroll's interior decor choices didn't go down well with fans when the former TOWIE star posted a series of pictures of their new house

'Billutifuls': The footballer surprised his fiancée with her very own home beauty salon, revealed on the former reality star's Instagram page

The couple, who announced on Christmas Day that they are expecting their first child, were photographed on a massive fuchsia pink sofa in a room covered with zebra print wallpaper and matching cushions. They were holding mugs with their initials printed on them, and a tiny dog was perched on Carroll’s lap.

The pink theme continues throughout the house – there’s also a neon pink beauty salon which Carroll, 25, installed for his wife-to-be as her Christmas present, complete with a Snow White mirror with the words ‘Mirror, mirror on the wall’ written in pink lights.

Posing in a pink dressing gown and a pair of M&S pyjamas with her hair in rollers, Miss Mucklow gushed her approval of the beauty salon: ‘Biggest shock of my life, secret key led to a secret room in my new house! My very own salon called “Billutifuls” I’m one lucky girl.’ 

Another snap posted by Miss Mucklow of a family get-together over Christmas included neon pink and purple disco lights projected on to the ceiling of the mansion’s dining room.

The couple were clearly keen to make sure their visitors were comfortable – a picture of their sweeping staircase included a row of his-and-hers white and black guest slippers.

One image shows the couple lying on their bed with their flowing locks spread out beneath them, taken from their reflection in the mirrored ceiling above.

Carroll captioned the snap: ‘Good morning from our new home!! #crazyhair #dirtymirror.’

Miss Mucklow, who quit The Only Way Is Essex to run a Bikram yoga studio, started dating Carroll in the summer of 2013 but they kept their relationship under wraps until February 2014.

Baby joy: The couple - who became engaged in November - are expecting their first child together 

The former TOWIE star donned a Christmas jumper to make to announce her pregnancy on Christmas Day 

While many of her 160,000 Instagram followers seemed impressed with her new home, calling her a ‘lucky cow’ – apparently as a compliment – Carroll’s were less enamoured.

One fan despaired: ‘Bruv, why did you let her have a pink sofa? That’s the worst room I’ve ever seen.’

Others agreed it was ‘naff’, with one commenting: ‘Footballer, Essex, Reality TV person. Really was never going to be a bastion of taste was it?

‘If they’d kept it to themselves, then that’s their choice. If they choose to inflict it on us via one of the plethora of “celeb-mags”, then they open themselves up for comment, even ridicule...’

Carroll is not the first footballer to be derided for his home interiors. Ex-Manchester United defender Phil Neville and his wife Julie had giant gold initials ‘P and J’ installed into wrought iron gates at their former Versace-themed mansion in Lancashire.

Aston Villa star Stephen Ireland was ridiculed for installing a £100,000 fish tank and a pool table with his surname picked out in the baize. 

Earlier this week the footballer denied claims he had been caught up in an alleged hamper scam alongside West Ham manager Sam Allardyce (right)
