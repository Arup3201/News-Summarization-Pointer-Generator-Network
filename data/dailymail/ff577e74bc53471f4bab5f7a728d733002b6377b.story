Old rivals Aer Lingus and Ryanair have taken their feud to Twitter after Ireland’s national airline pointed out an embarrassing gaffe on the budget carrier’s website.

The latest row erupted when Aer Lingus tweeted photos and claimed one of its planes was featured in the background of an online advert for Ryanair’s ‘business plus’ service.

With a smiley face emoticon for good measure, Aer Lingus gleefully wrote to its 89,000 followers: ‘Epic #photobomb by EI-DVM on Ryanair’s website! Even they know we’re Best for Business’.

The latest row between the rivals erupted when Aer Lingus claimed its plane is featured in a Ryanair advert 

Ryanair fired back with a tweet accusing Aer Lingus of providing expensive and poor service to customers

Aer Lingus’ attempt to publicly embarrass Ryanair didn’t sit well with its low-cost rival.

Ryanair responded with an affront of its own: ‘Even @AerLingus is talking about @Ryanair Business Plus. FYI, he’s smiling cos he saved a fortune & avoided another late @AerLingus arrival!’

As their Twitter followers weighed in and encouraged more banter, the Dublin-based airlines traded a few more tweets before calling it quits.

One Twitter user asked if it was friendly banter or if the airlines hate each other.

Aer Lingus responded: ‘Just some healthy rivalry, Des. Isn’t that right, @Ryanair?’

But Ryanair, whose feisty chief executive Michael O’Leary once famously told customers looking for a refund to f*** off, refused to play nice.

It said: ‘We stopped being rivals in the 90s. We’d have to treble our fares & lose 81m customers to be your rival’.

Twitter followers weighed in and encouraged more banter or questioned whether it was 'friendly banter'

Aer Lingus replied: ‘Okay, nevermind. #PeaceOut’.

The Twitter row came a day before the UK Court of Appeal was schedule to rule on Ryanair’s 29.82 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.

Ryanair is the largest individual shareholder and it is set to find out if it will be forced to comply with competition regulators and sell down to no more than five per cent. 

Earlier this week Ryanair predicted British Airways-owner IAG will return with another tilt at Aer Lingus as soon as this week.

The budget airline said it is ‘actively’ seeking a buyer for its stake in Aer Lingus, which it has to sell due to competition requirements, and expects IAG to make a third offer to the group imminently.
