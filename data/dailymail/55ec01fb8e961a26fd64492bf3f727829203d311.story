Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna called for curbs on jobless migrants

Jobless migrants could be barred from moving to Britain if they do not have the offer of work under controversial plans being drawn up by Labour.

Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna insisted the founding principle of the European Union was 'free movement of workers not free movement of jobseekers'.

It comes after a top Brussels official accused politicians in the UK of fuelling myths about an 'invasion' of immigrants, claiming David Cameron's tough rhetoric risks ‘destroying the future’ of the British people.

Mr Cameron has made clear that tackling 
immigration from Europe would be a key demand of his plan to renegotiate
 Britain’s EU membership, before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

The Prime Minister has suggested curbs on people from poor parts of Europe moving to Britain for work while also banning migrants claiming child benefit to send to families back home.

Ahead of work restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians being lifted on 1 January, the government rushed through laws to stop new arrivals claiming benefits for three months.

However Labour suggested it could go further and prevent anyone moving to the UK if they do not have a firm offer of work.

Mr Umunna said: 'The founders of the European Union had in mind free movement of workers, not free movement of jobseekers. And undoubtedly we do have to work with our European partners to deal with that.

'What people intended when they built the EU in the first instance was that people who either had a job or had the skills to get a job would move around the European Union,' he told BBC1's Question Time.

'The problem that we've had at the moment is that we've had, during our time in office - and this is where we did make a mistake - you had high skilled people coming from other countries to do low skilled jobs here.

'All people want is a system that is properly controlled and managed, and more work needs to be done on that.'

The remarks are the strongest signal yet of a major new immigration policy from Labour, and comes after leader Ed Miliband vowed to close a loophole which allows migrants to paid less by agencies.

But a Conservative spokesman said: 'Labour had 13 years to change the EU's rules and fix the immigration system, but they failed to do so.

'They even decided to opt out of transitional controls on the right of people coming from new member states to work here.

'That's why David Cameron's long-term plan is to seek a new settlement for Britain in Europe, including putting in place new arrangements that will slow full access to each other's labour markets until we can be sure it will not cause vast migrations. We would then put this new settlement to the British people through an in-out referendum.

'But Ed Miliband opposes our long-term plan to fix our relationship with Europe and to let Britain decide. Nothing would change under Labour.'

Attack: Viviane Reding, vice-president of the European Commission, accused David Cameron of fuelling populist rhetoric about and immigration 'invasion'

Meanwhile, Downing Street has rejected heavy criticism from Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the 
European Commission, that Mr Cameron is fuelling fears of an 
'invasion'.

She insisted Britons claim ‘much more’ in benefits than EU 
migrants and accused Mr Cameron of using 'populist' rhetoric to pddle 'myths.

Taking part in an online web chat, Miss Reding said: The free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections,’ she said.

‘I’m mostly frustrated about the political leaders [in Britain]. What is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes? You are destroying the future of your people, actually.

Pressure: The Prime Minister has vowed to use his planned renegotiation of Britain's EU membership to tackle immigration

‘What the people who come to work bring to the taxation and social security is much more than they take out.

“And those who take out of social security are much more the [UK] nationals than the European Union citizens, who take advantage of the free movement of people.

‘It’s just a myth to speak about an invasion, this invasion is just not taking place.’

But a government spokesman hit back: 'Hardworking people expect and deserve a benefits system that is fair to British citizens and migrants who come here to work but is robust and tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law.'

At the weekend Mr Cameron said: ‘My job is to put in place proper controls so people can’t come here to claim benefits; to put in proper controls to investigate that people aren’t being paid less than the minimum wage; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants; to make sure if people can’t sustain themselves, they are removed from our country. All those steps we’ll be taking.’

The Prime Minister insisted it was wrong that the British taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the European Union.

He added: ‘There are other European countries who like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland.’

But the remarks triggered an angry response from Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski accused Mr Cameron of ‘stigmatising’ Poles by singling out the nation’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform EU welfare rules.

Mr Sikorski said: ‘If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn’t it also pay their benefits? Why should Polish taxpayers subsidise British taxpayers’ children?’
