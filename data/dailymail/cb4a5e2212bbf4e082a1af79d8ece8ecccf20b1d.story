Questions have been raised over Australia's nutrition watchdog stance against the controversial Paleo diet, with supporters of the fad taking to social media to voice their outrage.

Over the past few months, those who believe in the diet - including celebrity chef Pete Evans - have taken to Twitter to hit back at the Dietitians Association of Australia's (DAA) July criticism of the trend.

In a statement, the association's chief executive officer Claire Hewat said the Paleo diet was 'potentially dangerous' and evidence of its benefits 'just doesn't stack up'.

Celebrity chef Pete Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism

In September, the My Kitchen Rules judge took aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia 

Her comments came just months before Pete Evans' 2,100-word rant on his Facebook page, which claimed the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism.

Evans is known for his role as a judge on reality cooking series My Kitchen Rules.

In the rant, he took aim at the Heart Foundation as well as DAA, questioning their motives behind their damning view of the Paleo diet.

'Why does the DAA and heart foundation have financial ties to Multi national (sic) food processed food corporations that litter the supermarket shelves with so called "healthy foods"?' Evans wrote on his Facebook page.

In the rant, Evans questioned DAA's motives as did other people on social media in the past few months 

Evans was not the only one to take aim at the DAA for its stance on the Paleo diet

Natasha Lutrov - a Melbourne health blogger - also voiced her opinion on her blog on the issue

But he was not the only one who quizzed the DAA's partnership with Arnott’s, Nestle and Unilever - who own Streets ice cream.

The Paleo diet requires people to cut out 'grains, legumes, certain dairy products, conventionally-raised meats, non-organic produce, and genetically modified and processed foods', which Ms Hewart says is not practical for many Australians. 

Ms Hewat said the diet was first suggested by researchers in 1985 to combat current-day chronic diseases that were a result of 'gene-culture mismatch' and humans' inability to adapt to diets beyond the Palaeolithic period.

But she said this was not true and humans continued to develop. 

'A recent search of the published studies looking at Palaeolithic diets revealed no more than ten studies, all with very few participants over very short timeframes – most less than three months,' she said.

‘We all eat, and so to a certain extent, we know what food makes us feel good. 

'But rather than getting on the latest fad diet bandwagon, I urge Australians to become familiar with the dietary guidelines.'

He took aim at the DAA's sponsors, hinting that their support may have sparked their stance on the paleo diet 

But Pete Evans was not the only one to voice his concerns about the DAA's motives, news.com.au reported.

Melbourne-based health blogger  Natasha Lutrov - who indulges in 'the paleo way' - also raised questions about the association's corporate sponsors.

'It's clear that DAA have vested interests and therefore this media release is an obvious public relations crisis management tactic,' she wrote on her blog. 

'Why? The main message of the paleo diet is to ditch the processed foods and to eat food, which would have a detrimental affect on their major sponsors products like Campbell, Arnotts, Nestle and Unilever.'

While Natascha Mirosch tweeted: 'The Dietitians Association of Australia is sponsored by Arnotts, Nestle & Kelloggs...Terrible'. 

Evans' September rant also made controversial claims about the diet's effect on autism.

'Why has our rate of autism jumped from 1 in 10000 children in 1974, to 1 in 50 in 2014, where do you think it will be in another 40 years if it is escalating at this rate? This has grown rapidly since the guidelines have been in place,' he wrote.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Dietitians Association of Australia for comment.
