Children have become pawns in the escalating civil war between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian fighters as new battles raged overnight in the besieged city of Slavyansk.

Pictures emerged of a protest with children holding signs begging the Kiev forces to halt their assault in the city, the epicentre of pro-Moscow resistance in the east of the country.

Ukraine claims that the pro-Russian 'terrorists' are using children and women as 'human shields' in Slavyansk, basing themselves in residential buildings.

One sign held by children read: 'If we die, millions of people will not forgive you.'

'Do not kill us': Pictures have emerged of a protest with children holding signs begging Ukrainian forces to halt their assault in the besieged city of Slavyansk

Begging: Signs held by the children included the messages: 'If we die, millions of people will not forgive you', 'Soldier, do not shoot' and 'God how I want to live'

A
 report accidentally posted on a Russian government website suggested as
 few as 15 per cent of Crimeans voted in favour of being annexed to 
Moscow, it has been claimed.

The
 document, which was quickly taken down, reportedly appeared on the 
website of the President of Russia's Human Rights Council.

It
 apparently revealed there was only a 30 per cent turnout of which half voted for annexation, it was reported by Forbes which cited 
claims by major Ukrainian news website TSN.ua.

The
 figure of 15 per cent is vastly lower than Vladimir Putin's claims that
 97 per cent had voted in favour with an 83 per cent turnout.

The TSN report does not link to a copy of the report.

However,
 Forbes says there is another report called Problems of Crimean 
Residents on the Human Rights Council's website that contains estimates 
of the March 16 vote.

The 
report states that 50 to 60 per cent voted for unification with a turnout 
of 30 to 50 per cent, which leaves a range of 15 to 30 per cent of Crimeans
 opting to join Russia.

Others pleaded: 'Soldier, do not shoot', 'God how I want to live', 'Do not kill us' and 'Take away the Grads', a reference to BM-21 launch vehicles.

Automatic gunfire and explosions were heard overnight amid suspicions that pro-Russian forces are seeking to break out of the encircled city where there are reported to be food and medical shortages.

It came as the Russian Foreign Ministry today called on Kiev to immediately stop 'the use of force against its own people' in the unrest.

In a statement, it said: 'The illegitimate authorities in Kiev go on crudely trampling on widely-recognised rights, with the connivance of their Western patrons.'

Earlier, Ukrainian forces seized the rebel-held city hall in the eastern port city of Mariupol overnight, driving out pro-Russian activists, then withdrew, making no attempt to hold onto the building, witnesses said.

Ukraine's Channel 5 television said earlier the Ukrainian National Guard had seized the administrative centre in Mariupol, a mainly Russian-speaking city of half a million and key component in the self-declared breakaway People's Republic of Donetsk that will hold a referendum on secession this weekend.

However, the Ukrainian flag, hoisted by the police, was taken down and replaced by the separatists' Donetsk People's Republic flag after just three hours.Â 

Witnesses said the soldiers left after smashing furniture and office equipment.

The smell of tear gas hung in the air inside the building which was largely empty in the morning, except for activists in gas masks clearing debris.

Grip of civil war: The U.S. has vowed more sanctions on Russia, accusing Vladimir Putin of seeking to annex more of Ukraine by 'bogus' secessionist referendums in Donetsk and Lugansk regions

Pawns: Trouble has also spread to the southeastern city of Mariupol, with separatists burning tyres and men in military uniforms without insignia setting up checkpoints

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov
 also issued his latest withering attack on the Ukrainian authorities, 
accusing them of seeking to hide the cause of the inferno in Odessa in 
which 42 perished.

'What happened in Odessa on 2 May is clear fascism,' he said.

'We will not allow the facts to be 
swept under the rug like the ruling coalition is presently trying to do 
by closing the investigation from the general public.

'We
 will push for the truth. We will push so that all of the evidence that 
was given by witnesses and tell the story of the magnitude of the 
tragedy that is being consciously hushed by the authorities, so that not
 one piece of truth remains uninvestigated and that it is all made 
public.'

Acting Ukrainian Prosecutor General Oleh Makhnitsky is to invite international experts to investigate the deadly fire.

The U.S. has vowed more sanctions on 
Russia, accusing Vladimir Putin of seeking to annex more of Ukraine by 
'bogus' secessionist referendums in Donetsk and Lugansk regions.

U.S.
 Secretary of State John Kerry, accusing Putin of 'calling the shots', 
warned: 'This is really the Crimea playbook all over again, and no 
civilized nation is going to recognize the results of such a bogus 
effort.

'We flatly reject this illegal effort to further divide Ukraine.

'We
 are not going to sit idly by while Russian elements fan the flames of 
instability instead of fulfilling the commitments that we made.'

The
 U.S. will apply new tough sanctions aimed at entire sectors of the 
Russian economy, said assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland.
