Prized vineyards in Burgundy have been 'catastrophically' damaged after a torrential downpour on Tuesday.

As much as 90 per cent of vines in some vineyards could be unusable, creating a ruinous effect on the grape harvest. 

Hailstorms and high winds caused major damage in the Beaune region, home to five celebrated wine-growing villages, including Pommard, Meursault and Volnay.

Cecile Mathiaud of the Burgundy Wine Board said the grapes were destroyed in the hail and many vineyards were hit by flooding.

Ms Mathiaud explained simply: 'If the grapes burst open, you can’t harvest.'

It is thought that in the high-end producing region of Aloxe that 50 per cent of vineyards suffered damage and 40 per cent of Meursault vineyards.

Jean Yves Devevey, who runs an eponymous vineyard, described hailstones the size of marbles on his blog today, as he estimated losses in his Beaune vineyard at 70 percent to 80 percent.

The region produces some of the most expensive wines in France. A Premier Cru Meursault can change hands for up to £1,050 and a Grand Cru from Aloxe-Corton can cost £150.

Winemakers fear they will be able to supply their usual amount and that 
the price will have to increase because of the scarcity in 2013-4 vintages.

Compounding the effect is the fact that the same area suffered hail last year, already causing high losses.

Caroline Parent-Gros, another local winemaker, said: ‘It’s a really hard blow for the winemakers, especially after 2012, which was already half the usual harvest due to hail.'

Jasper Morris, Burgundy director at wine merchant Berry Bros. & Rudd in London warned: 'Some people could go out of business. These guys are working 365 days a year for one harvest to produce something magical, and in a space of two hours, they can lose the lot.'

Storms look likely to hit France again this afternoon, with a risk of hail.
