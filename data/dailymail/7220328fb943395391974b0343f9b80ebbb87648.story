Sam Burgess will make his first start in an England shirt when he lines up for the Saxons against Ireland Wolfhounds on Friday night.

The former rugby league superstar switched codes to join Bath in October and just three months on he'll wear the No 12 shirt for Jon Callard's England second-string in Cork.

Burgess will be joined in midfield by Wasps' Elliot Daly and starts outside Exeter's promising young fly-half Henry Slade.

The Saxons will be captained by Northampton scrum-half Lee Dickson, who is one of nine full internationals in the starting XV, with a further two on the bench. 

Saxons head coach Callard said: 'I've watched Sam from afar in how he's evolving in the game, he's an impressive character,' said Callard of Burgess, who only joined Bath in late October.

'We're all excited for Sam, but we're taking it very, very calmly.

'There's plenty of time for him to develop.

'There's huge expectation obviously, but it's an opportunity to test the waters at this level, see where he is, then reassess and put another plan together.

'He's certainly capable of playing international rugby: we'll know a little more after Friday night.

'He won't be fazed by it, none of these guys are fazed by it.'

Burgess, 26, will be hoping to force his way in to head coach Stuart Lancaster's England training squad announced in May ahead of the World Cup in September.
