Passengers on a new flight planned between Vienna and Bratislava will barely have time to open the inflight magazine and order hot drink between take-off and landing. 

FlyNiki, a low-cost Austrian airline, has announced plans for what it claims is the world’s shortest international flight – a 30-mile trip between the Austrian and Slovakian capitals.

But baring in mind that the journey takes just an hour by car and even less by train - one wonders if it's worth the hassle of faffing around in immigration and check-in. 

FlyNiki will launch their snappy 'ten minute' flight between Vienna and Bratislava in April this year 

It's also a fifteen minute drive to the airport from central Bratislava and 20 minutes from Vienna, so a bus ride might even be quicker, and it would certainly be cheaper. 

Perhaps aptly, the route, which will cover around 30 miles,  launches on April 1, and while it's likely to be on the radar of many aviation enthusiasts, it's unlikely to be an appealing option for most regular travellers.

Dallas to Sydney on Qantas, 16 hours and 55 minutes.

Johannesburg to Atlanta on Delta Airlines, 16 hours and 40 minutes.

Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles on Etihad, 16 hours and 25 minutes.

Dubai-International to Los Angeles on Emirates, 16 hours and 35 minutes.

Jeddah to Los Angeles on Saudia, 16 hours and 55 minutes.

Westray to Papa Westray Orkney Islands on Logan Air, 47 seconds.

Taitung to Green Island, Taiwan on Daily Air, 15 minutes.

Zanzibar to Dar Es Salaam on Zan Air, 20 minutes.

Kinshasa to Brazzaville on Camair-Co, 30 minutes.

Mumbai to Pune on Jet Airways, 45 minutes in total.

Bosses at the airline admit it will be primarily useful for those with connecting flights from Vienna. 

The world's shortest flight is currently the mile-long journey from Westray to Papa Westray in Scotland's Orkey Islands, which can take as few as 47 seconds, depending on wind direction.

A bidding war over the route was settled in 2013, with the contract being awarded to Scottish airline Loganair, its current operator.

Meanwhile, the record for longest flight goes to Qantas' 17-hour , 8,500-mile schlep from Sydney to Dallas.
