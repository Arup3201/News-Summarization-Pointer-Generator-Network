Taylor McDonnell, 21, (pictured outside an earlier court hearing) is accused of being 'grossly distracted' on her phone when she knocked down grandparents Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86

A hairdresser was 'grossly distracted' using her mobile phone behind the wheel when she knocked down and killed a retired couple who were walking arm in arm, a court heard.

Taylor McDonnell, 21, was driving her blue Toyota Aygo through the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales, when she ploughed into grandparents Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86.

Newport Crown Court heard how McDonnell spent 18 minutes of her 20-minute drive making a series of phone calls while behind the wheel.

Retired RAF airman Denis and teacher Joyce – who were married for 54 years - died from their injuries after being hit by McDonnell's car. They had been walking arm in arm during an evening stroll.

The court heard how McDonnell was driving in slippers on her way to see her boyfriend when she hit the elderly couple.

Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said McDonnell made 'four or five' phone calls while driving.

She told the court: 'She was grossly distracted by her telephone.

'She wasn't paying proper attention to her driving - which ultimately caused the deaths of two elderly people - because a telephone call was far more important.'

The court heard how Mr and Mrs Drew were seen walking slowly together – both using walking sticks - on November 13, 2013.

They were side by side as they walked across the quiet 30mph road outside a well-lit pub.

Miss Crowther told the court: 'They had very nearly finished their crossing when they were hit by the blue Toyota Aygo being driven at around 30mph by the defendant.

'Mrs Drew was flung onto the bonnet and windscreen and part of her body struck the side of the car before she was thrown onto the verge.

'Mr Drew was hit by the car and run over.

'His legs were trapped underneath the car and he was dragged along the road for more than 16 metres until the car was stopped.

'The defendant didn't brake her car until she hit Mr and Mrs Drew.

'She didn't take any action to avoid the couple.

'She stopped her car and ran into the nearby public house for help.'

The court heard that McDonnell thought she had hit a woman on her own and didn't realise Mr Drew was stuck under her car.

Drinkers in the Star Inn recalled her running hysterically into the bar and screaming for help while clutching her iPhone in her hand.

The court heard she said: 'I was driving along the road, I didn't even see her until she hit my windscreen.'

Grandparents Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86, were out for an evening stroll in the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales, when they were struck by McDonnell's blue Toyota Aygo and knocked to the ground

McDonnell denies two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and is on trial at Newport Crown Court

Family and friends of the elderly couple wept as they listened to the heroic efforts of other motorists to comfort the stricken pair as they lay seriously injured on the ground.

One driver discovered Mrs Drew lying on the verge with her 'clothes in disarray' and covered her with a fluorescent jacket.

Miss Crowther said: 'The gentleman gave her basic first aid and could tell she was still alive.

'He stayed with her and talked to her and stroked her hair and held her hand.

'He comforted her, just to do what he could for someone clearly in extremis.

'As he did that he heard a groaning and could see Mr Drew was trapped beneath the car.'

The court was told Mr Drew was able to speak to police officers and paramedics fighting to free him.

'He spent all the time asking about his wife,' Miss Crowther said. 

McDonnell (pictured left outside court, and right) was driving in her slippers and was on her way to visit her boyfriend, the court heard. Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said McDonnell made 'four or five' calls while driving

The prosecution said McDonnell (pictured), a hairdresser, admitted speaking on her telephone while driving but said she had been using the loudspeaker function when the crash occurred on November 13, 2013

Mrs Drew died of her 'massive injuries' in Royal Gwent Hospital just a few hours later. 

Mr Drew was too weak to undergo surgery to treat the multiple fractures, lacerations and deep bruising he suffered, and he died in the same hospital six days later.

Miss Crowther said McDonnell admitted speaking on her telephone but said she had been using the loudspeaker function when the crash occurred.

However, she said the driver insisted she had been 'driving carefully and paying attention to the road' and there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision.

Miss Crowther said: 'She said in essence she thought Mrs Drew had run out into the road ahead of her.

'We say her driving fell far below the standard of a reasonable and competent driver.

McDonnell (pictured), of Caerwent, Monmouthshire, was said to have run hysterically into a nearby pub and started screaming for help while clutching her iPhone in her hand following the crash, the court heard

McDonnell denies the charges against her and the trial at Newport Crown Court (pictured above) continues

'Had she been paying attention to the road the least she could have done is slow down and try to avoid them, or have done something.

'But if you are on the telephone it makes it very hard to look out of the windscreen and see anything.'

McDonnell, of Caerwent, Monmouthshire, denies two counts of causing death by dangerous driving.

The trial at Newport Crown Court continues.
