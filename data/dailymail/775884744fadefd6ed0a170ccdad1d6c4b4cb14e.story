Many of us like to relax with a nice glass of red wine after a hard day - and this monkey appears to be no different.

The playful primate was caught clutching a bottle of red wine just outside the University of Natural Sciences in Malaysia.

He seemed to be desperate for a drink as he wrestled with the 2008 cabernet sauvignon.

Photographer and physics professor, Mihail Nazarov, was stunned when he came across the extraordinary scene.

The 66-year-old, originally from 
Moldova, said the hundreds of monkeys around the campus regularly entertain staff and students.

He said: 'There are more monkeys than students here and they seem to feel relaxed, just like they are at home.

'The campus is situated on territory 
seized from the jungle so it sometimes feel like you're visiting a zoo, 
the only difference is there are no enclosures.

'I assume this monkey must have stumbled across the bottle and happened to like the smell of it.

'He tried for a while to open it and was eventually clever enough to pop the cork.'

Mr Nazarov said he liked watching and photographing the mischievous apes. 'They are amusing,' he said, 'but I never expected to see anything like this.'
