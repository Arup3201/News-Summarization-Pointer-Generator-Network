Bebeto celebrated the 20th anniversary of one of the most memorable celebrations in World Cup history - by posting a photo of him and his son recreating it.

The former Brazilian striker ran off after scoring against Holland at USA 1994 and put his arms in front of his body and swayed them from side to side as if cradling a baby.

The birth of his son, Mattheus Oliveira, inspired the improvised celebration and the now 20-year-old helped remake it in a photograph Bebeto posted on Instagram along with presenter Patricia Poeta.

The celebration turned Bebeto from a relatively unknown member of Brazil's 1994 World Cup squad into an instantly 
recognisable face on the world stage.

It is hard to believe that Bebeto's celebration and the USA World Cup was a full 20 years ago, with the image still etched into World Cup fans' memories as if it was only last week.

Bebeto scored 39 goals in 75 caps for Brazil and won the 1994 World Cup.

His son, Oliveira, is an attacking midfielder for Flamengo and has represented Brazil U20s four times.
