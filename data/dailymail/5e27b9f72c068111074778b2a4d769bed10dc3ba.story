His lifetime’s ambition was to remove Scotland from the United Kingdom and, in that endeavour, history will reflect that he failed.

Not now, not at any time in the future, will Alex Salmond lead his native land to the political status that he calls freedom.

The 59-year-old First Minister of Scotland knew there would come but one chance to fulfil his dream of independence and the determination and guile with which he set about the task was, at times, awe inspiring.

For unionists – those people who Mr Salmond now knows still make up the majority of Scots – his efforts were terrifying too.

Nobody but Alex Salmond could have led Scotland to the brink of divorce from the rest of the UK. In truth, it is highly unlikely that anyone but this man could have led the Scottish National Party into government, far less carve open the Westminster defence and set up a clear shot on goal.

But, in doing so, he laid his leadership of the nation and his party on the line. If he did not score, he could not continue.

Married to the reclusive Moira – 17 years his senior – childless and completely obsessive about politics, Mr Salmond is a man with few hobbies. But betting on the horses was one.

Here was the biggest gamble of his life. Had the masterplan to break up the 307-year-old union succeeded, it could have been David Cameron announcing his departure from No 10 yesterday.

Many of those who watched the premier’s highly emotional plea for a No vote earlier this week had the clear sense that, if Scotland left, the Mr Cameron was gone too. The referendum Mr Salmond fought for, and to which Mr Cameron agreed, was a career-ending shoot-out. And, in Mr Salmond’s case, it was the final stop in a 40-year journey.

It concluded not, as he had wished, with the promised land, a confident, assured Scotland entirely in control of its own destiny. It concluded, as perhaps he should have known it would, with his country renewing its historic bonds with its United Kingdom ‘family’.

Should the West Lothian-born civil servant’s son have sensed as much when he attended St Andrews University during a time when Scottish nationalism was little more than a fringe movement?

He was as Labour as his father Robert in those days – until he had a row with his girlfriend, a pretty English girl called Debbie Horton. Their ideological clash ended with her screaming: ‘If you feel like that, go and join the bloody Scots Nationalists’.

Their faces tell the story. Clad in tartan and bearing flags, they were hoping for triumph – but ended up in tears. After Alex Salmond’s bid for independence was defeated, the sense of disappointment was felt keenly in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

‘My feeling was just crushing, quite devastating,’ said first-time voter Charlotte Darroch, 16, watching the count in the capital wearing a school uniform covered in Yes badges. ‘I genuinely thought the feeling on the ground was different.’

Near Edinburgh Castle, tearful tartan-wearing activists gathered, surrounded by Yes slogans. The party – meant to be a celebration of a new dawn - was definitely over.

The following day the teenage student in economics and medieval history found himself in the Dundee offices of the SNP. Little would they imagine the constitutional ramifications of his conversion to their cause.

In time, this cocky young man’s political powers would relegate the Conservative Party to also-rans in Scottish politics. And, in a few more years, the decades-long dominance of the Labour Party north of the border would be smashed. It was not merely through charm and persuasion – though Mr Salmond possesses both – that these were achieved.

Last week, nationalist grandee Jim Sillars stood shoulder to shoulder with Mr Salmond on the campaign frontline. But, in less politically optimistic times, Mr Sillars had opposed his successful 1990 bid to lead the party.

‘After seeing him in operation as deputy leader,’ he said, ‘I knew that his penchant for disliking and denigrating those who disagreed with him would turn the SNP into a nest of vipers, poisoning its bloodstream.

‘I was not wrong. Among Salmond’s most vociferous supporters ten years ago you will find today his most vociferous opponents, all of them wounded when they would not toe the leader’s line, all discarded when they showed they had a mind of their own. You can always judge men by those they gather around them. Big men attract big men. Little men gather cronies, smaller than themselves.’

Those remarks came in 2000 when Mr Salmond had just resigned after a decade as leader. Mr Sillars did not reckon on the Salmond comeback four years later. He could not have dreamed the party colleague he cared little for would be by some distance the biggest political beast in the land – a figure so focused on his goal that some of the shrewdest strategists in the UK despaired of finding a way to stop him.

Mr Salmond’s colleague, education secretary Mike Russell, once described the experience of walking down the street with his party leader. It was, he said, like watching a ‘crusade to personally convert every Scottish voter’. Others pointed to his bullying, domineering nature. It was even hinted at – unfairly perhaps – that the notorious cybernats and the Yes campaign’s over-aggressive campaigners were formed in the image of their party leader.

Ever ready to play the ‘bully’ card against Westminster, Mr Salmond had little compunction about throwing his own weight around. He was the master of the skilfully worded put down, a politician who rarely seemed happier than when the joke was on his opponent.

Ultimately, the smugness began to jar. Too fond, said commentators, of playing the man rather the ball.

Despite the failure, the scale of what Alex Salmond has achieved in Scottish politics is immense

And yet the scale of what Alex Salmond has achieved in Scottish politics is immense.

It was during his first spell of leadership that he campaigned alongside the Scottish Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats for devolution.

It came in the form of a Scottish Parliament with powers over major areas of policy such as health, education, justice and local government.

Lord Robertson famously said at the time the new constitutional arrangement would ‘kill nationalism stone dead’. Mr Salmond reasoned more astutely that it would breathe new life into the movement – that, ultimately, devolution would become the highway to Scottish independence.

Even now, in failure, the leader of the SNP has wrested a raft of new powers for Scotland from Westminster. Alex Salmond may have said that independence referendums are ‘once in a generation events’ but his party’s next bid for independence could come sooner than many imagine.

What now for the man whose last attempt to take a back seat and spend more time with Moira in Aberdeenshire resulted in a slump in his party’s fortunes?

Mr Salmond contends that his wife had the veto on his standing for the leadership of the party in 2004. Had she used it, few believe the UK would have stood on the brink of being broken apart this week.

As one fellow member of the Scottish Parliament observed: ‘Without politics, Salmond would have nothing.

‘He exists only for politics.’

If Scotland does one day cut its ties with the rest of the UK, there is little doubt that Alex Salmond will be credited with laying the groundwork.

But that is not the goal he set himself. He is not a man who will take defeat easily.
