How soon is too soon? And do you really love someone after three months (Cheryl Cole)?

They're the three most significant words in the English language. Deliver them at the right time to the right person and the first time they're said out loud calls for champagne.

Blurt them out at the wrong time to the wrong person and you need a stiff drink for totally different reasons. It's the ultimate embarrassment.

Tracey says that it isn't really possible to fall in love after three months as you are not yet aware of any of their flaws 

Most of us have a justifiable phobia about being the first to say the 'L' word. Why? Because we don't know what the hell we'd do if our partner doesn't say it back.

There is only one correct response to 'I love you' and that's 'I love you too.'

So, what if they say, 'That's nice. Anyway, as I was saying . . .'? Or look at you with pity and say, 'Listen, you're awfully sweet but . . .'?

Timing is everything.

Say 'I love you' too soon and you not only look desperate, you instantly lose power and dignity.

Leave it too late and you risk missing that magic moment which could launch you both onto the next relationship stage.

So how do you judge when it's appropriate to let the cat out of the bag and someone into your heart?

Tracey says you should wait until you're bursting to tell someone you love them

Only you can truly answer that one, but these are some things you might like to think about:

Make sure you both speak the same language

Your 'I love you,' might mean, 'I think this is special, let's give it a go.'

His interpretation might be, 'When's the wedding?'

If you think your partner will overreact, tack something on the end like, 'Don't panic – I'm not about to propose. I'm just telling you how I feel.'

Wait until you're absolutely bursting

Like, you'll internally combust if you don't say it right now. You're 100 per cent convinced you mean it.

You don't love someone after three dates

When I was 12, a kid at my school came up to me and delivered a message. 'See that guy over there?' he said, pointing to a kid from my English class. 'Well, that's Brad and he sent me over here to tell you he loves you and wants to go steady.'

'Okay,' I said.

Brad and I went steady for a whole week.

We didn't speak once though we did sit together outside E-block for a full five minutes and looked at our feet. True love? At 12, yes. But if you're over 18, I think not.

Telling someone you love them on the second date or second week is ridiculous. It's daft – and that's what they'll think you are if you do it.

To avoid a false reply, Tracey says you should never say 'I love you' before or after sex

You don't really love someone after three months

The fact is, the first time anyone says, 'I love you,' they usually don't.Not really.

True love takes years to develop (take note, Cheryl Cole) and if you're lucky, it's always growing.

You look back and think, I really thought I loved them when I said it back then but it's nothing compared to how I feel now.

That's not to say you can't feel 'in love' after three months of heavy dating, and it probably is acceptable to trot it out then. But for absolute maximum impact, I'd wait six.

I know - hard core - but if someone says, 'I love you,' after you've dated for six months, they've thought long and hard about it.

Saying, 'I love you,' when you're in the infatuated part of the relationship is easy: you aren't aware of any faults.

Saying it when you've got a pretty good idea of what you're letting yourself in for is far more of a compliment.

An ex of mine told me he loved me for the first time when I stumbled back to bed after throwing up for the sixti­eth time that night because of food poisoning.

Call me strange but I was far more complimented than if he'd said it across the candlelit dinner table earlier that evening, when both of us were tarted up and looking fabulous, totally unaware I was about to swallow a dodgy oyster.

Sneaky ways to say it

The coward's way of saying it first is to say, 'I think I'm falling in love with you.' If they look at you in horror, you can always say, 'Don't panic, I know it's just casual with us. I was only kidding . . .' or, 'That's why I've decided to break it off – you don't feel the same way.'

Another less traumatic option is to pop it at the very, very end of a conversation when you can disappear immediately after saying it. Like just before you walk through the doors to catch a plane or at the end of a phone call.

Dropping the 'I' off it also makes it less heavy. 'Love you' is what you say to your mum. Again, if they look uncomfortable, you can always add, 'As a friend, of course.'

If you're unsure of whether it's reciprocated, try putting something after it. 'I love it when you do that', 'I love it when we spend time together.'

'Saying, I love you, when you're in the infatuated part of the relationship is easy: you aren't aware of any faults'

If they look wide-eyed and gaze at you hopefully, it's safe to say the big three words solo.

Don't ask them

Never ever follow up, 'I love you,' with, 'Do you love me?' If they do, they'll tell you immediately. If they don't, they're forced to say something like, 'Gee. Uhhh. I guess so.'

Dignity demolished.

Don't do it with sex

Don't say it just before (especially before) or after sex – you won't be able to trust their reply.

Some people will say anything to get laid, and if it's afterward, feel forced to say, 'I do too,' because they've just had sex with you, for God's sake.

Few of us are courageous enough to ravage someone then say, 'Actually, it was just the sex I wanted.' Even if it was, they'll mumble something appropriate just to be polite.
