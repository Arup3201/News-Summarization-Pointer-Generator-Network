A French left-wing MEP has hit out at the creators of video game Assassin's Creed over their portrayal of Maximilien de Robespierre.

A slight artistic liberty from the creators sees the character of Robespierre presented as a psychopathic mass-murderer, which has enraged the French left,

Jean-Luc Melenchon claims the depiction of Robespierre, considered by many to have been the architect of the French Revolution, in the latest installation of the game is 'propaganda against the people'.

Robespierre, considered one of the most influential politicians of the French Revolution, remains a controversial figure in the country's history.

Despite being a fierce opponent to the death penalty early in his political career, he praised the Reign of Terror that followed the fall of the French monarchy as 'necessary, laudable and inevitable'.

During the 11 months of 'Terror' 1793-1794, more than 40,000 people were executed, mainly as part of public spectacles using the guillotine.

However, his depiction in Assassin's Creed: Unity has not been welcomed by the left-wing on France.

Attack: MEP and former presidential candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, also accuse makers Ubisoft of being part of a 'capitalist conspiracy'

'This is propaganda against the people,' MEP and former presidential candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon said, accusing the creators, Ubisoft, of rewriting French history as part of a capitalist conspiracy.

'A man who was our liberator at one stage of the Revolution is portrayed as a monster,' he is quoted as saying in The Independent.

'They are insulting us to destroy what keeps us together as French people.'

The game has also been accused of giving young people a distorted view of history, but not accurately portraying the events of the French Revolution.

However, Ubisoft and the team behind Assassin's Creed: Unity, has hit back at this, defending their right to artistic license.

'We're making art,' said 'Unity' level design director Nicolas Guerin. 'It's not a historical simulation.

We still want players to feel like they're in the Paris they've seen on a postcard or visited in person, but there's pressure — because many of the developers are French — to make sure that we render justice to the capitol of my country, as well as to history.'

'Assassin's Creed: Unity' designers spent two years erecting a virtual Notre Dame — inside and out — to scale, but it is not historically correct. 

Despite the fact 'Unity,' is set before the iconic cathedral's spire was built, it sits atop the game's Notre Dame. Likewise, Bastille is still standing when it would've been rubble.
