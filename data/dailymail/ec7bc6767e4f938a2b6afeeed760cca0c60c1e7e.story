Napoli failed to close the gap on Serie A leaders Juventus after surrendering a two-goal lead against Inter Milan at the Stadio San Paolo on Sunday night.

Marek Hamsik headed in Henrique's cross six minutes after the interval, before Gonzalo Higuain doubled Napoli's advantage shortly after the hour mark with a stunning curled strike into the far top corner from 25 yards - putting the hosts firmly in the ascendancy before the late drama.

It was Argentina forward Higuain's first league goal since a double against Genoa on January 26, although he has scored an impressive 13 goals in 25 league appearances this season.

However, the match turned on its head 18 minutes from time when the visitors pulled a goal back.

Rodrigo Palacio fired home from close range after a series of close-range shots were charged down.

And then after a sustained period of pressure from Roberto Mancini's men, Inter levelled with just three minutes remaining.

Mauro Icardi was clearly not feeling the pressure as his exquisite chipped penalty found the middle of the goal, after Henrique was shown a second yellow card for pulling down Palacio in the area.

Napoli now find themselves 12 points off the leaders Juventus - having played a game more too - while Inter remain firmly poised in mid-table with 36 points from their 26 games to date in Serie A.
