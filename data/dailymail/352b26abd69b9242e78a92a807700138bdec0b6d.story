Phil Parkinson may have snubbed Jose Mourinho’s offer of a handshake before the final whistle sounded on Bradford City’s shock FA Cup win over Chelsea, but the 47-year-old will gladly borrow some of The Special One’s tricks as he tries to guide the League One club to Wembley again.

Parkinson faces Reading – where he spent 11 years as a player – at Valley Parade on Saturday knowing that another upset would see Bradford return to the national stadium in the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time in more than a century. 

Remarkably, he has already taken Bradford there twice in the Capital One Cup final and League Two Playoff final in 2013.

Parkinson did not want to be distracted by Mourinho’s premature offer of congratulations when Bradford came from behind to record a stunning 4-2 win at Stamford Bridge in January, before going on to take another Premier League scalp in Sunderland in the fifth round.

But the Bradford manager cannot help but admire the Chelsea manager’s win-at-all-costs mentality compared with some managers (look away Louis van Gaal) who are obsessed with imposing their ‘philosophy’ on a club.

‘I like the fact that he will do whatever it takes to win,’ said Parkinson. ‘We are in an era of managers who sometimes their own philosophy gets in the way of what’s the most important thing to win each individual game.

Phil Parkinson believes the big teams in the Premier League are jealous of Bradford 

Chelsea were beaten 4-2 by League One outfit Bradford during the fourth round back in January 

‘Mourinho sets up his team to win. The Capital One Cup final (against Tottenham) was a good example of that. ‘For me, that’s what management is about. Not just saying “we’ve got good players, go and play”. It’s about what tweaks and adaptations are we going to make today to give us the best chance of winning? That’s why I like looking at what Mourinho does because he has great skill at that.’

It’s one reason why Parkinson is happy to let talk of the poor playing surface at Valley Parade carry on ahead of Reading’s visit. He believes that it got into the heads of Sunderland’s players in the last round and contributed to Bradford’s 2-0 win. 

‘I think more was made of the pitch for the Sunderland game,’ he added. ‘By the time their lads came to the game it was probably a bigger thing than it actually it was. We’d had a dry week and it wasn’t too bad.

‘If you look around, a lot of pitches are not in a great state at the moment and we’ve got some good technical players.

‘We’ve found that rather than saying “God, I just need big strong physical players on the pitch”, you need technical players that can handle the bad pitch and we’ve tried to get our best technical team out there.’

Mourinho isn’t the only Premier League boss that Parkinson admires. The ambitious Bradford boss has also modelled his managerial style on Sir Alex Ferguson and was able to study Arsene Wenger’s situation while scouting for Arsenal in 2011 following his departure from Charlton.

‘Obviously I’m ambitious like every player in the squad and every member of staff,’ said Parkinson. ‘You’ve got to want to be right at the top of your game, and I’m no different.

‘There are many managers I look at. The Arsenal experience was great for me because I’d just left Charlton and they gave me the opportunity to work within their scouting network.

‘The longer that went on, the more senior Premiership targets they sent me to watch. It’s a great insight into how a club like Arsenal have to operate because obviously they can’t compete with Manchester City and Chelsea so they had to look at the level underneath or the players that weren’t obvious to everybody else.

‘I really enjoyed that and learned a lot from it. I got offered a couple of jobs within that period but I wanted to see that short-term through with the Arsenal experience.

‘In terms of managers, Sir Alex Ferguson is an obvious one. His leadership qualities but also the way he evolved as a manager.

‘Myself and (assistant) Steve Parkin, the rest of the staff, try to have a modern approach with the way we do everything but with an old school mentality of discipline, honesty and commitment. We expect those old school demands from the players.

‘With Sir Alex and Manchester United, you look at the discipline and the way the players drove on to the end in every game, and the pride they had in wearing the shirt, but also how he evolved all the time in progressing the club. I think he’s a great one to look at.’

So having won the playoff final with Bradford in 2013 just three months after losing the Capital One Cup final 5-0 to Swansea, what are Parkinson’s priorities this time around as he tries to take the West Yorkshire club to the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 2011?

He said: ‘It’s difficult because when we had the Capital One Cup final, all the way I was saying “the league is more important”. But when we got to the semi-final we were on the point of making history.

‘I want to do both but at this stage, when you’re so close to being in an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley, this has got to take priority at the moment.’
