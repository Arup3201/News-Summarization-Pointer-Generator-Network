A seaside town got a trendy new look when some mystery knitters covered public spaces in brightly coloured crochets.

Residents in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset awoke to find walls, seats, decking and statues in the seafront gardens covered in knitwear.

It is said to be the work of the anonymous 'ninja knitters' who use wool like graffiti to decorate everything and anything, from bollards to parked cars, as part of the knit-bombing craze.

But unlike graffiti, the knits can be easily removed and tend to be welcomed by the community. 

Lesley Cook told Burnham-On-Sea.com: 'It's so lovely to see. The kids are enjoying it - they especially love the flowers and the woven picnic blanket which is complete with knitted sandwiches.'

Another visitor, Dave Andrews, added: 'It's brilliant. They've done such a fantastic job. The cherub statue is superb and the First World War themed blanket was very touching.'

The tribute taken from poem For The Fallen to commemorate soldiers who died in World War One

The tribute to World War One comes from a poem by Robert Laurence Bnyon, For The Fallen and is decorated with knitted red poppies.

Other creations included knitted flower pots, hanging baskets, a knitted bird and birdhouse and a watering can.

The news comes as a Polish knitter called Agata 'Olek' Oleksiak got into trouble with authorities in Mexico, who are are lodging a case against her, for covering sculptures under the sea in knit-wear.
