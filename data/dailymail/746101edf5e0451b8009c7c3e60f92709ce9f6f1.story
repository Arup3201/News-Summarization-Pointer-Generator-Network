We have heard of foot fetishes, but this is ridiculous.

Having hundreds of must-have heels at her disposal isn't enough for the shoe-loving wife of American designer Stuart Weitzman, who has spent years travelling the globe curating a collection of the planet's most weird and wonderful heels.

The fantastical footwear Jane Gershon Weitzman discovered on her globe-trotting - including pairs made from corrugated
 cardboard, wire, wood, steel and even flowers - has filled 
the windows of the flagship Stuart Weitzman Madison Avenue store in New York for years.

And now the best of them have been brought together in a style book celebrating the creativity of the industry.

Shoe designer Stuart Weitzman's wife Jane has created a design book featuring the fanatastical shoes she has spent years collecting from around the globe

For a dozen years Jane filled her husband's windows with eccentric shoes

Art & Sole by Jane Gershon Weitzman features 150 fantasy art shoes from the Stuart Weitzman Collection. Like a true fantasy, none of them are designed to do anything practical like be walked in, instead they are seen as pieces of art. 

Feathers, paper, ceramic, metal, resin, 
playing cards, corrugated cardboard, Swarovski crystals, even fresh 
flowers and icing sugar have all been used -  fused together by remarkable imagination. 

'The
 shoes that I have collected to include in Art & Sole represent the 
best of more than a thousand that have appeared in Stuart Weitzman 
stores over the years,' she writes in the book's introduction.

'I hope you enjoy looking at them as much as I enjoyed working with the very special artists who created them.'

Art & Sole: A Spectacular Selection of More than 150 Fantasy Art Shoes from the Stuart Weitzman Collection by Jane Gershon Weitzman is published by HarperCollins priced at £19.99 and available now

For years, Weitzman store windows were filled with commissioned shoes created from unusual materials

Shoes are made from feathers, paper, ceramic, metal, resin, playing cards and even corrugated cardboard

The Jewels At Work shoes appear both practical and utterly frivolous in their design
