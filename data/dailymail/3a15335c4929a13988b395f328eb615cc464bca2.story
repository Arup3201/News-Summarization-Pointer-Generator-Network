The ex-wife of disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne is to stand by her boyfriend, former Labour MP Denis MacShane, after he was jailed last week for fiddling his expenses. 

Vicky Pryce, who has been dating MacShane for 18 months, hopes their romance will survive his six-month prison sentence, The Mail on Sunday has been told.

Their relationship started shortly before Ms Pryce was herself jailed in March for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points from her ex-husband to stop him losing his licence.

Mr MacShane supported Ms Pryce, 61, during her two-month prison ordeal – and now she intends to do the same by him.

The exposure of MacShane’s crime followed two reports in The Mail on Sunday in 2009, which revealed how he submitted false expense claims for ‘translation services’.

Last week, he was imprisoned for six months for fraudulently claiming £13,000 in parliamentary expenses to pay for jaunts to Europe, including one to judge a literary competition in Paris.

The 65-year-old said ‘cheers’ as his sentence was announced, before adding ‘quelle surprise’ as he was led from the dock.

MacShane, who was Minister for Europe under Tony Blair,  submitted the bogus expenses through a company he set up under a false identity and used nine different spellings of his name so officials would think  the paperwork had been filled  in by others.

Jailing him, Mr Justice Sweeney said that his ‘considerable and repeated’ dishonesty had ‘reduced confidence in our priceless  democratic system’.

When first challenged over the MoS expose, MacShane accused this newspaper of ‘running unpleasant articles about me’ and ‘invading my privacy’.

But as his guilt became clear, he was forced to resign as Rotherham MP in November 2012. MacShane has had a chequered love life.

He lived with the late ITN newscaster Carol Barnes from 1975 to 1981, although the couple never married. 

In 1983, he married Polish-born Liliana Klaptoc, but they later divorced. In 1987, MacShane married Nathalie Pham, but the couple divorced in 2003.

His relationship with feminist writer Joan Smith ended in 2010.

MacShane joins a list of MPs who have been exposed by The Mail on Sunday as expenses cheats.

They include Tory MP Michael Trend, who was forced to stand down in 2005, and former Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who lost her seat in the 2010 General Election.

Ms Pryce declined to comment last night.
