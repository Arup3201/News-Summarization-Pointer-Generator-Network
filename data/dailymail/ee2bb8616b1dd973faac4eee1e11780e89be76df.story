Louis van Gaal created the little bit of history that he desired by ensuring Holland remained undefeated in normal and extra time with a 3-0 third-place play-off victory over hosts Brazil.

A penalty from Robin van Persie after just three minutes, a Daley Blind strike and a Georginio Wijnaldum goal in injury time ensured a comfortable win for Van Gaal's men in Brasilia.

Here, Sportsmail rates all of the players involved in the match. 

Success: Louis van Gaal's Holland side triumphed 3-0 over Brazil in the third-place play-off

Clincial: Robin van Persie put Holland ahead after just three minutes with an excellent penalty kick

Three-down: Georginio Wijnaldum adds a third for Holland as they comfortably see off Brazil in Brasilia

Bewildered: Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has seen his side concede ten goals in just two matches

Laughter: Neymar (left) was injured and unable to play but he still took his place on the Brazil bench

BRAZIL

JULIO CESAR - 6

Poor for the last goal but helpless for the first two.

MAICON - 6

Look likes a player who is treading water regularly but did okay at times.

DAVID LUIZ - 5

Poor for the second goal but was not anyway as awful as he was against Germany. 

Poor: David Luiz (left) and Paulinho (right) struggled to deal with Arjen Robben's pace throughout

THIAGO SILVA - 6

Totally out-paced by Arjen Robben after just two minutes for the penalty but he does make a difference to this Brazil side.

MAXWELL - 6

Ran his heart out for Brazil but this is just not a classy Samba side we expect. 

LUIS GUSTAVO - 5

Usually controls the midfield for Brazil but his form has deserted him in the last couple of matches.

Anger: Brazil captain Thiago Silva (left) appeals after giving away a second-minute penalty

RAMIRES - 6

He will run around for you as much as you like but he is also prone to committing a foul - and he made a couple of bad ones in this match. 

PAULINHO - 5

Could not get himself into the match and had very little impact. 

OSCAR - 7

Extremely unfortunate to be booked for diving when clearly clipped in the box and Brazil's most creative player. 

Hacked: Oscar (left) was fouled by Ron Vlaar (right) in the box but the Brazilian midfielder was booked for diving

Booking: Oscar (centre on ground) was yellow carded for simulation during the second half in Brasilia

WILLIAN - 6

Should probably have featured more in this tournament because his workrate alone is infectious. 

JO - 5

His Manchester City days may be long behind him but he is simply not a striker who should wear the Brazilian shirt. 

SUBSTITUTES: FERNANDINHO 46 (for Gustavo), HULK 70 (for Ramires), HERNANES 57 (for Paulinho).

BOOKED: Thiago Silva, Oscar.

MANAGER: LUIZ FELIPE SCOLARI - 5.

His side have conceded 10 goals in two matches and he must surely lose his job now.  

Deputising: Chelsea's Willian (number 19) played reasonably well considering his lack of World Cup action

Terrible: An awful week for Scolari got even worse as his side conceded 10 goals in just two matches

HOLLAND

JASPER CILLESSEN - 7

Didn't have too much to do but when he did he was commanding.

STEFAN DE VRIJ - 7

Every time Holland attacked the full-back seemed to be involved - he looks to be a real find.

RON VLAAR - 7

The Aston Villa centre-back has been a colossus in this tournament and he was once again. 

Strong: Holland centre-back Ron Vlaar (right) has been a colossus throughout the tournament

BRUNO MARTINS INDI - 6

The least effective of Holland's defence but still relatively untroubled.

DIRK KUYT - 6 

Admirably played despite having his head stapled and as industrious as ever.

GEORGINIO WIJNALDUM - 7

Finished off the result with a goal in injury time and had looked threatening throughout. 

Finish: Daley Blind scored a brilliant second for Holland as they cruised to victory in Brasilia

JORDY CLASIE - 6

Is not a player who will ever set the world alight but he does exactly what Van Gaal wants of him 

JONATHAN DE GUZMAN - 6

The Swansea star had a relatively quiet match but he had some nice touches here and there. 

DALEY BLIND - 7

His finish for the second goal was sublime and he has had a really impressive tournament. 

Foul: Arjen Robben (left) is dragged back by Brazil captain Thiago Silva in just the second minute of the match

Booking: Robben received a tellow card during the third-place play-off match with Brazil in Brasilia

ARJEN ROBBEN - 8

Broke free after just two minutes to win the penalty and continued his fantastic tournament. Serious Golden Ball contender.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE - 6

Stepped up and coolly slotted home third-minute penalty but still did not dominate as we know he can. 

SUBSTITUTES: MICHEL VORM 90 (for Cillessen), DARYL JANMAAT 70 (for Blind), JOEL VELTMAN 90 (for Clasie).

BOOKED: Robben, de Guzman.

GOALS: Van Persie 3, Blind 17, Wijnaldum 90

MANAGER: LOUIS VAN GAAL - 7. Delivered exactly what he said he would be ensuring the Dutch were undefeated in normal and extra time throughout the tournament.

REFEREE: Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria) 7

As cool as you like: Van Persie steps up and slots the ball home from 12 yards after Robben is up-ended

Celebration: Van Persie points to the sky after putting after his third-minute penalty against Brazil

Delivered: Van Gaal ensured his side remained undefeated in all matches in normal and extra time
