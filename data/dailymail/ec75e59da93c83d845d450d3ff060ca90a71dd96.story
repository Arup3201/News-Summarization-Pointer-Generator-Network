What do Kylie Minogue and the can-can girls at the Moulin Rouge have in common? They all get their dancing shoes from Maison Clairvoy, the Parisian bootmaker that has cornered the market for top end, made-to-measure footwear for screen and stage.

Founded in 1945, the Maison Clairvoy still operates from the shop where it all began - a small building at 17 Rue Fontaine, just 650ft from the Moulin Rouge itself.

Despite its theatrical clientele, the atelier began life as a simple shoe shop, with founder Edouard Adabachian creating bespoke footwear on demand for private clients.

By the 1960s, Maison Clairvoy had branched out into creating shoes for the theatrical world and today, theatre, cinema and even circuses account for 80 percent of the 400 pairs of shoes and boots the company makes every year.

Abadachian's descendants sold the business to Moulin Rouge in 2006 but little has changed otherwise. The shop is still half boutique and half theatre museum, with signed pictures of famous performers and a can-can costume permanently on display.

On the floor, a smooth red carpet evokes the world of cabaret.  'That is where tap dancers test the shoes,' explains bootmaker Nicolas Maistriaux, the current director of Maison Clairvoy.

According to the 35-year-old, the job of creating the shoes is a delicate one and the atelier employs five expert cobblers to create them. 'There 
are about 250 steps in the production of each shoe,' he explains. 'And a pair can involve anything between 20 and 60
 hours of work.'

The Moulin Rouge takeover has ensured the company's future by guaranteeing a steady flow of orders, Maistriaux adds. As a result, some of their top-selling styles are the calf-length, blue and red mini-boots in which the can-can is  performed.

 The shoes at Maison Clairvoy take between 20 and 60 hours to make and 
as a result, cost between £1,200 and £2,800 per pair

Thanks to Clairvoy's attention to detail, dancers can thump the stage floor repeatedly in confidence: the heels are specially designed to spread and absorb the shocks.

'Stage shoes have to be extremely high-quality, both from a technical and an aesthetic point of view,' says Maistriaux. The laces on the can-can boots are only there to enhance leg length: a zip on the outside of the boot actually does the job of keeping the dancers' ankles fully supported.

But while Maison Clairvoy still supplies shoes to the Moulin Rouge, it regularly makes shoes to order for film-makers as well. Recent examples have included the high heels that featured in French-Belgian production Guillaume et les garçons à table, or, as it's known in English, Me, myself and Mum,  and the Roman-era footwear sported by Gallic cartoon heroes Asterix and Obelix.

Jean Dujardin, the Oscar-nominated star of silent film, The Artist, is another client and slipped into a pair of spurred Clairvoy boots for the cinema adaptation of another cartoon strip, Lucky Luke.

'We modified the interior of the boot to make it easier for the actor to appear bow-legged like Luke,' reveals Maistriaux. 

Kylie Minogue turned to the company for her 2006 and 2008 tours, with the diminutive pop star requesting shoes with four-inch heels she could dance in and walk down stairs without looking at the steps.

But if you're planning to emulate Kylie's style, you could be in for an expensive surprise. A bespoke pair of high heels costs between £1,230 and £1,650 while men's made-to-measure shoes go for around £2,880.

It is a price worth paying, Maistriaux says, for a little piece of Parisian history. 'They are comfortable, they are beautiful and there is something timeless about them.'
