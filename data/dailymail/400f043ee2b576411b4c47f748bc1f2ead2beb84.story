A white supremacist who has been charged with three murders entered a plea of not guilty in court on Friday.

Frazier Glenn Miller, 74, is charged with capital murder in the April 13, 2014, shootings at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, and at the nearby Village Shalom Retirement Center.

Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, is a Vietnam War veteran from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party.

None of the victims of the 2014 shooting that took place on the eve of Passover, a week-long holiday in which the Jewish community celebrates their freedom from slavery in Egypt, were Jewish.

Miller, a supremacist, allegedly opened fire outside a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas screaming 'Heil Hitler!'

On Friday, Frazier also asked for a speedy trial and to have Internet access while he is in prison.

The judge granted him the right to a speedy trial, which will begin August 17, but denied him Internet access.

Miller said he would go to trial in 30 days if he could represent himself. 

Overland Park police Sgt. Marty C. Ingram testified earlier this month at a preliminary hearing that he heard shots fired at the Jewish Community Center and saw the doors of the center's theater shatter. He said he took cover as more shots hit the building's facade back on April 13.

'Dust, smoke was flying everywhere at that point,' he said. The gunman then drove away.

When he heard that fellow officers had arrested a suspect, Ingram accompanied some witnesses to the arrest scene to determine if they could identify him.

As they approached the patrol car where Miller was detained, he shouted 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed.

Miller is accused of killing Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were attending a singing contest audition at the community center.

He also is accused of killing 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Jewish retirement home.

Miller (above in 80s) was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car

At a December hearing, Miller, who has emphysema, said he was afraid that he doesn't have much time left to live following a trip to the emergency room in March.

Miller previously served three years in federal prison on weapons charges and for planning the killing of the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder.

He was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car.
