A travelling fair has advertised for a phantom to haunt its Ghost Train - but not a soul has applied.

Carters Steam Fair posted a spirited ad online and in jobcentres appealing for someone to dress up and scare members of the public for £6.50 an hour, plus 10p per scream.

The employers promised would-be applicants the opportunity to work with one of the 'most sought-after fun fairs on earth', whose fans have included the late Michael Jackson. The singer once offered millions of pounds to transport it back to his US Neverland home.

Must be prepared to travel: The successful applicant would have to play the part of a 'ghost, soul or personality of a person who has died and has somehow gotten stuck between this plane of existence and the next.'

Other 
celebrity supporters of the fair have included Who rock legend Roger 
Daltrey, Princess Diana and Princes Harry and William.

The job demands that applicants have no fear of the dark or the paranormal and must not be of a nervous disposition.

But the firm 
admitted that the reason they had to advertise the position was because 
its own workers had refused to enter the Ghost Train, fearing it really 
was haunted.

No experience necessary: The job ad on the Directgov website stated that the applicant must 'not be of a nervous disposition or be afraid of the dark, or of the paranormal'

The advert posted on the Directgov website and in local Jobcentres, read: 'GHOST: Actor performer wanted to work in travelling Ghost Train on Carters Steam Fair.

Celebrity fans: Michael Jackson offered to transport the fair back to his US Neverland home

'To play a part of ghost - or spirit or apparition - soul or personality of a person who has died and has somehow gotten stuck between this plane of existence and the next.

'Most researchers believe that these spirits do not know they
 are dead. Very often they have died under traumatic, unusual or highly 
emotional circumstances.

'Ghosts 
can be perceived by the living in a number of ways: through sight 
(apparitions), sound (voices), smell (fragrances and odours), touch - 
and sometimes they can just be sensed.

'Generally the work is on weekends and 
can be long days, 2pm until 10pm although this can vary. Applicant must 
be CRB checked, they must not be of a nervous disposition or be afraid 
of the dark, or of the paranormal.

'Experience not necessary.'

In return,
 the vintage funfair said they expected to pay above the minimum wage of
 £6.50 an hour - by paying 10p per scream on the ride, which is based at
 Hayes in Middlesex when not on the road.

But despite leaving it up for two weeks the fair has been left disappointed with not a single soul applying for the job.

A dozen staff members from the fair 
tested out the ride but were too spooked to accept the position. One 
worker said: 'I was sure I saw something moving inside. When I went in 
it was freezing cold, but there was no sign of anyone.'

Another said: 'A cold hand touched me.'

Creepy: The fair's current staff members tested out the ride but were too spooked to accept the position

Son of the director Joby Carter said: 'We can't find anyone to work inside it because it's so creepy.

'The hairs go up on the back of your arms and it freaks everyone out that goes in there, which is why it's so hard to find someone.'

Mr Carter claimed it would take someone who doesn't believe in the paranormal to fill the ghostly boots without getting squeamish themselves.

The job offer is still open to applicants who fulfil the criteria, but the company only wants people genuinely interested in the role - warning time wasters: we can see right through you.
