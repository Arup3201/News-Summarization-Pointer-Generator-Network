Victim: Cameron Smithies, 15, fell to 80ft to his death while standing near the cliff edge at Slains Castle

A 15-year-old boy fell 80 feet to his death from a cliff face near a ruined Scottish castle that is thought to have been the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Cameron Smithies is believed to have lost his footing while standing close to the edge at Slains Castle, Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire.

An RAF rescue helicopter was scrambled to the scene and the teenager was airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary but he died around 24 hours later.

Cameron, who would have turned 16 this Thursday, fell on Saturday afternoon. Police said the death is believed to have been a tragic accident.

Squadron Leader David Webster, 
from the Search and Rescue Squadron of RAF Lossiemouth, said that they winched the teenager to safety, although he later died.

He said: 'The crew were called to 
reports of a 15-year-old male cliff-faller and were told that coastguard
teams, paramedics and a lifeboat crew were already in attendance.

'Reports indicated that the casualty 
had fallen 80ft followed by another shorter fall into a gully - 
sustaining significant injuries.

'Due to the nature of where he had 
ended up, coastguard crew and paramedics abseiled into the gully and our
winchman used 160ft of cable to reach them.

'The winchman assessed the casualty and put him on a stretcher, before he was extracted and flown to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.'

A Police Scotland spokesman 
said: ‘Cameron Smithies, 15, has died at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary 
following a fall from Slaines Castle, Cruden Bay, Peterhead at around 5pm on Saturday.

'Investigations are continuing into this accident and a report 
will be submitted in due course to the Procurator Fiscal.’

As Cameron's family and friends began paying 
tribute, his auntie Caroline wrote on Facebook: 'RIP Cameron Scott 
Smithies you were the best nephew and taken
from us far to soon rest easy now xxxx.'

Peterhead Canoe Club chairman Daryn Hubbucks said that Cameron, a keen canoeist, from Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, had a 'zest for life'.

He said: 'I had the sad news today that Cameron Smithies died of his injuries after falling off cliffs at Slains Castle.

'Cameron was a cheeky wee monkey 
with a big heart and zest for life, he was just starting out in life and
getting his kayak feet, Cameron was just well up for anything.'

Overlooking the North Sea, the 16th century Slain Castle is thought to have been the inspiration for Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula.

The author wrote some of the famous novel while staying at Crookit Lum Cottage in nearby Cruden Bay in 1895.

It is thought he visited the castle during that time as a guest of William Hay, 19th Earl of Errol.

Although Dracula is based in a castle in Transylvania, Romania, the Scottish ruin is thought to have provided the author with some of his inspiration.

Despite its literary links, there were plans to turn the abandoned castle into flats in 2007. However, they were abandoned in 2009 following a property downturn.

Bran Castle, in Romania, is marketed as 'Dracula's Castle'. However, there is no evidence that Stoker ever knew it existed - although it has appeared in Dracula films.

One canoeist, Malcolm Brown, wrote: 'This
is really devastating sad news. He was a likeable friendly guy and fun 
to have along on the river trips. Sorry for the loss of such a young 
star.'

Friends and schoolmates also paid tribute to Cameron.

Jemma Mckenzie added: 'RIP Cameron, can’t believe it, you’ll be missed.

'Actually still can’t get my head 
round that your gone, horrible to think how we were speaking the other 
day and never going to speak again.

'Heaven certainly has gained another angel, rest in peace.'

Just two weeks ago a lifeboat crew
from Peterhead were called out to Slains Castle, which overlooks the North Sea, when a pet dog fell 
60ft down nearby cliffs and later died from its injuries.

Constable Matthew Roger of the Buchan 
local policing team warned parents to make sure their children stay away
from the dangerous cliffs.

He said: 'Whilst a popular attraction 
to many, I would like to highlight the particularly hazardous nature of 
the ruins at Slains Castle.

'Members of the public are encouraged 
to take great care at this site and parents are asked to ensure they are
aware and take efforts to prevent their children playing here 
unsupervised.'
