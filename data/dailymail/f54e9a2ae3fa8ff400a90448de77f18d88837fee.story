A therapist has been sent to prison after pleading guilty to having sex with his teenage patient.

Scott Andrew Peterson has begun serving his sentence of between one and 15 years in the Utah State Prison.

Peterson, 36, had a sexual relationship with a female patient who was 14-years-old at the time of their affair.

Cutting a deal: Scott Andrew Peterson, seen in court on Monday, will spend between 1 and 15 years in prison

They began having sexual contact in March 2013, and it continued until August.

The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the inappropriate relationship only ended when his business closed.

Judge John Morris called the licensed social worker's behavior 'utterly reprehensible'.

'You can't un-ring the bell,' Judge Morris said on Monday.

His Mormon victim and her family were in the Farmington courtroom on Monday but they did not make any statements.

The police investigation was launched after the girl, whose name has not been released due to the nature of the crimes, told her bishop about the alleged abuse.

Accepting fault: Peterson was arrested in November and has stayed in custody since because he wanted to start paying his price as soon as possible

The legal department for the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints then told police who arrested Peterson in November.

The charging documents noted that Peterson 'occupied a position of special trust' with the girl and exposed himself.

He was stripped of his clinical license in November as well, and his lawyer said that he was hoping to avoid prison time on account of the fact that he admitted his guilt and opted to remain in police custody since his arrest.

Caught: The abuse started in March 2013 and ended when his business closed in August of that year

'There were a lot of positive things that Mr Peterson did that I was hoping would persuade (the judge) not to impose prison time,' his lawyer Tara Isaacson said to The Salt Lake Tribune.

'He obviously felt incredibly guilty and wanted to start the punishment process.'

Public records list him as being married to Andrea Harrison Peterson, who is also 36.

As part of the plea deal, his charge was lessened from the original first degree felony sodomy, three counts of second-degree felony forcible sexual abuse and one count of misdemeanor lewdness.

He plead guilty to one count of forcible sex abuse, and has been ordered to pay an unidentified amount of restitution to the girl and her family.
