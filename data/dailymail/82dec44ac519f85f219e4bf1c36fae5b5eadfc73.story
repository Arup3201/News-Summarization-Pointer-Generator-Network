Up to 13,500 British troops will protect the London Olympics from a terrorist atrocity, it was revealed today.

The figure is 4,000 more than the number who currently serve in Afghanistan and will see bomb disposal experts, specialist sniffer dog handlers, building search teams and regular soldiers will support the police to keep the 2012 Games safe.

The Ministry of Defence added that snipers in Lynx and Puma helicopters will patrol the skies of London.

Typhoon jets will move to RAF Northolt in west London from bases in Scotland and Lincolnshire so they can be scrambled to the Olympic site within minutes.

And Royal Navy warships and RAF 
fighter jets bristling with fearsome weaponry will also be on standby to
ensure the sporting showcase does not come under attack.

Crack special forces units are also understood to have been practising manoeuvres to prevent fanatics targeting the Olympics.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said
security would remain police-led but the Armed Forces would make a 
‘significant contribution’.

He said the Games, which will feature
10,500 athletes from 105 countries with an estimated 10.8million 
spectators, was ‘the biggest security challenge this country has faced 
for decades’.

Military personnel would contribute to ‘ensuring a safe, secure and enjoyable Olympics’, he said.

Security chiefs are acutely aware 
that the Olympic and Paralympic Games would be a prized target for 
terrorists. The Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, will itself 
contain the 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium, Aquatic Centre for swimming 
events and the athlete’s village.

Mr Hammond said that despite agreeing
that 13,500 servicemen and women would help guard 150 venues and 
training sites, there would be no impact on the UK’s military 
commitments around the globe, including the war in Afghanistan. MoD 
sources said the figure was not dependent on troops being brought home.

But it is much higher than the 7,000 
troops that had been expected to be assigned to Olympics duties. The 
increase came after the Government announced 23,700 security staff would
be needed at venues next summer - more than double the original 10,000 
estimate.

Last week ministers revealed the security budget for the Games had soared £282million to £553million.

In a written ministerial statement, 
Mr Hammond said some 5,000 troops would support the police by providing 
specialist capabilities including bomb disposal and dog teams.

Around 1,000 personnel will provide logistics support including transport and engineering.

And about 3,500 troops will provide venue security, rising to 7,500 on peak days during the Olympics.

Royal Navy flagship HMS Bulwark, 
21,500-tonne floating fortress with state-of-the-art weapons, 
command-and-control and communications equipment, will be based off the 
coast of Weymouth, Dorset, to protect the sailing events.

HMS Ocean, the largest ship in the 
Royal Navy, will be berthed in the River Thames at Greenwich to provide 
an operating site for Lynx and Puma helicopters.

And sophisticated Typhoon fast jets 
armed with deadly air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, recently to 
pound Colonel Gaddafi’s troops, will fly from RAF Northolt in London.

Surface-to-air missiles with a range 
of more than seven miles will be used to support the protection of the 
skies above Olympic venues.
