Holidaymakers seem as keen to work out as chill out when away on breaks, according to a survey, and it may be inspired by fitness-loving celebrities.

As many as 47 per cent of Britons would be keen to head off on a fitness holiday, the poll by foreign exchange company Travelex showed.

More than a third (34 per cent) booking health holidays are prepared to spend £500 or more on a trip, with more than half reckoning they will get better deals on fitness activities abroad than at home.

With a number of celebrities advocating exercise while on holiday, it seems the old adage of a break involving lounging around may be outdated.

Model Gisele Bundchen has shared with her Instagram followers a series of photos of her exercising and performing yoga on the beach, and other stars such as Kelly Brook and TOWIE'S Lucy Mecklenburgh are similarly as strict with their fitness routines.

Naked yoga, bootcamps and Nordic Walking are among the activities Britons have attempted, with 30 per cent of those keen on a health holiday seeing it as a chance to tone up and 23 per cent to lose weight.

Also, 21 per cent wanted to learn a new skill while 17 per cent wanted to concentrate purely on their well-being.

In contrast, boozy group trips only appealed to five per cent of the 2,000 people polled.

Among destinations for health holidays picked out by Travelex were Bali, Tanzania, Finland and Stockholm in Sweden as well as more traditional places such as the US and New Zealand. 

Elvin Eldic, from Travelex, said: 'Although the tourism industry has always offered healthy getaways, our research shows that fitness holidays are not only becoming more popular, they're also increasingly destinations where we wouldn't have considered to go on holiday such as Tanzania and Finland.' 

Travelex have also produced a fitness program that can be adopted on your holiday. This can be viewed here.
