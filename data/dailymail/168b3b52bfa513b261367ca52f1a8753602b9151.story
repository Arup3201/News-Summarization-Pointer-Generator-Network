Steve Bruce is aiming to cause an upset in Saturday's FA Cup final, and it will make a welcome change from his last visit to Wembley, if he does.

The upset then was on a purely personal level, and he was on the receiving end after a ruthlessly blunt message from Sir Alex Ferguson an hour or so before kick-off in the 1996 final against Liverpool.

Traditionally turned out in a specially-tailored Cup final suit, Bruce was soaking up the atmosphere with his Manchester United team-mates when Ferguson took him aside and told him he wouldn’t be in the team. Not that afternoon, not ever again.

A brief spell at Birmingham followed, but ask him to reflect on a glittering playing career, and Hull City’s manager will pinpoint that brief conversation on the Wembley turf as the moment it all ended.

As he prepares to lead Hull out against Arsenal, he hopes his return to a rebuilt Wembley will provide him with the sharpest of contrasts, emotionally.

Asked about the pain of losing to a Paul Rideout goal against Everton in ’95, the former United skipper said: ‘The ’96 final was worse, when Fergie told me on the pitch I wasn’t playing. That’s when I found out. It was about half-one. I’d had a hamstring and had missed the previous three weeks, but, even so, it wasn’t easy to accept.

‘He just told me there and then. To be fair to him, it was his way of saying: ‘"Steve, thanks very much, this is it for you." Sure enough, it was. It was the most disappointing thing for me, the most disappointing moment of my career. A couple of years earlier, I became the first English player to lift the double, which was a brilliant moment for me personally, but this was the other extreme.

‘He left it that late for a reason, and it is something I have taken into management. If you name your team at the beginning of the week, you are going to have 11 ecstatic players and 11 absolutely destroyed for the rest of the build-up. He would always leave it late for big games, and that was his way of keeping everyone on their toes until shortly before kick-off. Mind you, it has taken me 20 years to get over it!

‘Looking back, it was his way of breaking it to me that I wasn’t just missing the Cup final. He was saying your time’s up, mate. For me, that was the end of my career. I stood there, and it began dawning on me that I was finished at Old Trafford. It was a case of saying to myself: “Look Steve, you’re 36, you’ve had a fantastic innings, but that’s it.” I had to try and take all that in, but it wasn’t easy.

‘Eric Cantona scored the winner late on, but I couldn’t even tell you whether I got a medal. Apparently I did, but I don’t regard it as the same, because I didn’t take part in the final. I suppose if you play in the earlier rounds, you deserve it, but everyone wants to be involved in the final. That’s just human nature.

‘I’ll have to do the same to some of my players, and tell them they’re not in the team, and I’m not looking forward to it. It doesn’t matter whether you put them in an office, a room somewhere or out on the pitch, it’s something they won’t want to hear. If they’ve got any professional pride about them, which these boys have, they are going to be desperately disappointed.

‘From a personal perspective, much as my last visit hit me hard, this one could more than make amends. Without question, there is more pride and satisfaction from going to Wembley as a manager than as a player, and if we can win, it would be the highlight of my career.

‘Somehow, it has lost its glamour over the past 15 years, but when you get to the semi-final and final, it is still something to enjoy and savour. Behold the beauty of the FA Cup is upon us. Mighty Arsenal against tiny Hull. That, for me, is what makes it great.’

Bruce provided an insight into his relationship with controversial owner Assem Allam and revealed that he thought long and hard before accepting his job offer.

‘After what happened at Sunderland, the next job was always going to be crucial to me, and when this one came up, a lot of my pals said: “Steve, are you sure?”,’ he recalled.

‘They were a mid-Championship side at best, and when I went to the chairman’s house, here in Hull, he offered me a salary which I think I was earning in 1984! But I actually found that quite endearing. I said: “Do you want me to do it for nothing?” There was almost a bit of naivety about him, and I just thought that was terrific after some of the things I’d experienced as a manager.

Giving: Hull City chairman Assem Allam gave a local hospital in Hull £7million last week

‘What can I tell you about him? He doesn’t have a mobile phone, for one thing. In fact, he hasn’t got anything new-fangled, really. He considers a mobile an intrusion in his life, but at least it means I can’t get sacked by text message.

‘He has been here 50 years and lives three miles away, and he gave the local hospital £7million last week. He has given more to this community than probably anyone has, and he is a genuinely nice man.

‘I don’t think he could ever envisage we would reach an FA Cup final, but then none of us could. I’m delighted for him, just as I am for the players and supporters. But the job’s not done yet. It’s only a great day at Wembley if you win. That’s the challenge we face, finding a way of beating Arsenal.’
