A neonatal nurse who lay dead in her home for seven years was being investigated for 'inappropriate conduct towards a child' at work shortly before her death, an inquest heard.

The mummified body of Anne Leitrim, 58, was discovered at her Bournemouth flat in June by bailiffs who had been called because of her unpaid mortgage.

She was under final warning at Homerton University Hospital in east London after a disciplinary hearing on 6 June 2007, Bournemouth Coroner's Court heard.

The mummified body of Anne Leitrim, 58, was discovered at her Bournemouth flat in June by bailiffs who had been called because her mortgage had not been paid

Her badly decomposed body was found near her bed along with a note which read, incorrectly: 'My doctors has done anything wrong. I love my babies. Goodbye Janet.'

A post mortem report said that the body was in 'a state of advanced mummification' and a cause of death could not be ascertained because toxicology tests were impossible.

Coroner Sheriff Payne said the 'vague' note 'could be treated as a suicide note', but there was no physical evidence at the scene to indicate she had taken her life.

It also emerged that she had been taking medication for anxiety and stress for about 10 years.

Her GP said he last saw her in June 2007 when she was suffering from a high level of anxiety.

A waist-high pile of post for Ms Leitrim had built up in the hallway of the flats, where neighbours said they thought she had moved away.

Her sister Katherine Clarke said that Ms Leitrim had had lost contact with the family around 20 years ago, but they were not sure why.

She trained as a nurse, working in Glasgow, Barnet and St Thomas' Hospital in London.

Ms Leitrim bought the flat in Bournemouth in the 1970s and continued to work in London, living there while she was on duty.

Fiona Kennedy, from Homerton University Hospital in London, said that allegations had been made of inappropriate conduct towards a child in Ms Leitrim's care.

She had been given a final written warning, but a back-to-work plan was put in place.

Ms Leitrim did not attend further appointments and did not respond to letters and phone calls from the hospital.

With no next of kin on file, she was put on unauthorised absence in August 2007 and her employment terminated that November.

Coroner Payne said: 'She had no social life down here (in Bournemouth); people didn't know who she was to any great extent.'

With no cause of death and no evidence, the coroner said he had no alternative but to record an open verdict.

Campaigner Esther Rantzen has urged people to check on their neighbours this Christmas, saying it is the perfect time to go round with a card and a mince pie.

'I think we're different [today] in the sense that we're quite concerned about people's privacy and we don't want to intrude,' she told the Daily Echo.

'At Christmas we don't want that to be on our conscience and it's the perfect time to go round with a Christmas card and a mince pie and make sure that whoever it is, whether an elderly person or a single mum, to bang on the door and wish them a happy Christmas.'

Ms Rantzen, who founded Childline and The Silver Line, a helpline for older people, said: 'I think there are a lot of people who should be asking themselves questions [in the case of Miss Leitrim].'
