Manny Pacquiao's proposed fight with Floyd Mayweather took another step closer after he agreed terms with his promoter.

The 36-year-old Filipino agreed terms with Top Rank, and is now waiting for Mayweather to do the same.

The date of May 2 has been put forward for a showdown in Las Vegas between the rivals that has been years in the making.

Top Rank vice president Carl Moretti told ESPN.com: 'Top Rank and Manny have agreed to the terms on our side. I don't know about the other side.'

Pacquiao last week told the Manilla Standard: 'We will make an announcement before the end of the month. I think it will happen.'

Mayweather wants to fight on May 2, the Saturday closest to the Cinco de Mayo holiday, as has been his tradition in recent years.

But that date has also been earmarked for Miguel Cotto's proposed clash with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez which would be one of the biggest fights in the history of the Puerto Rico-Mexico rivalry.

Mayweather said last month: 'The public want this fight. I want it. the only stumbling block has been Bob Arum (Pacquiao's promoter) but I think both fighters want it. So it's time to get it on. I'm not ducking anyone, so let's get this on.

'Years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing. I just want to have an even playing field.

'Now he's in a very, very tight situation with his loss to (Juan Manuel) Marquez and his loss to (Timothy) Bradley. His pay-per-view numbers are extremely low, so he's desperate. I wanted that fight a long time ago.'

The fight is likely to take place at the MGM Grand's Garden Arena, the venue for Mayweather's last 10 fights and five of Pacquiao's previous seven contests.

Pacquiao believes his long-awaited fight with Mayweather will be announced in January

Pacquaio has reportedly agreed to a 40 per cent cut of the revenue, leaving the remaining 60 per cent to Mayweather.

But Pacquiao has long been adamant that he would accept the smaller portion in order to end more than five years of debate since the fight was first mooted.

Before Christmas he told Sky Sports : 'Mayweather can get the amount he wants. I challenged him to a charity fight. Until now, he has not agreed to it. So, money is not the issue in our fight. This fight is about legacy, this is about making the fans happy and, above all, this is for the good of boxing.

'He has reached a dead end. He has nowhere to run but to fight me. I will try my best to make this a thrilling and entertaining fight. But I doubt if he's gonna engage me in a slugfest. You all know his fighting style. Most of his previous fights, if not all, induced us to sleep.

'I know what I have to do. I will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring. We will devise a good fight plan against him.'
