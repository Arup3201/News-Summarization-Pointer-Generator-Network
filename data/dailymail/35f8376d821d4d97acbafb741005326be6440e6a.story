This man looks to be falling from outer space as he skydives to Earth in this stunning video.

You could be forgiven for thinking that the television commercial was filmed using special effects and a green screen as the skydiver looks weightless in the slow motion clip.

The incredible video for Sony A7R cameras was filmed in just nine one-minute jumps.

Weightless above the world: This skydiver looks weightless in this stunning television commercial

The advert was filmed at Skydive Nagambie in Victoria, Australia, featuring performers Sharky (Jaak Saega), Sas (Simon DiSiascio), Simon Chaberka, Adam Long and Rob Douthat.

Director Jeff Gaunt said it was not a typical skydiving commercial.

He said: ‘We won’t be standing there watching the actors on the monitor next to the DP [director of photography].

Outer atmosphere: The clip, for Sony A7R cameras, was shot in nine one-minute skydives which captured 125 frames per second

Mid air shoot: In each of the nine jumps, they tried to get two or three shots as the skydivers plummet to the earth

‘We actually won’t even be able to see the actors when we are shooting, mainly because they’re going to be about 15,000 feet away right up there in the sky.’

Shot at 125 frames per second, the skydivers look to be floating through the air in the clip by cinematographer Simon Hammond.

The skydivers even manage to change lenses in mid air as they plummet.

Serene scene: To rehearse the shots, the skydivers did a 'dirt dive' to perfect exactly what was needed

Smile: Sony used the advert to emphasise the importance of avoiding exposing the sensor and glass of the camera to the elements for too long, particularly when you are in a situation that 'isn't so ideal'

Mr Gaunt said: ‘We were allocated nine jumps to do the whole commercial.

‘In one minute we tried to get two to three different shots so basically we had nine minutes to shoot this TV commercial.’

The team of highly-skilled skydivers rehearsed for the shoot on a ‘dirt dive,’ practicing the shots to work out exactly what they needed.

The commercial mirrors the amazing feat done by daredevil Felix Baumgartner, the first freefall diver to break the sound barrier after jumping from a balloon 24.5 miles above the Earth reaching speeds of up to 834 mph before his parachute opened, in October 2012.

In the stunt for Redbull, the Austrian landed back on solid ground five minutes later to have completed the highest and fastest skydive in history.

Mr Baumgartner made his death-defying jump from a tiny capsule that took him up to the edge of space, which took him two-and-a-half hours to travel 128,177ft above the New Mexico desert - and less than ten minutes to land.
