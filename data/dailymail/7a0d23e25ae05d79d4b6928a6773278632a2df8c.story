A Polish woman has admitted she is 'positively surprised' she can obtain child benefits from Britain for her son, even though he lives in Warsaw. 

Evita Kossman is one of 20,000 immigrants from the EU currently claiming benefits from the UK for children who live in a different country.

The mother-of-five is raking in £220 a month in welfare payments from the UK thanks to her husband, Sebastian working in a Bristol factory for a decade.

£220 a month up: Evita Kossman lives in Poland where she is earning a living running a restaurant but gets benefits for her son thanks to her husband working in the UK

'I was positively surprised that Great Britain supported us and helped my family well,' she told Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole.

'No one comes from Great Britain, from the welfare system, to check on us. No one comes to check that I am here with (my son) Mateusz. They pay. I am very surprised. They are very trustful.' 

Evita had joined Sebastian and their other grown up children in Britain but she returned to Poland with ten-year-old Mateusz because he was struggling at school.

Although he is now apart from his father - who he only gets to see a few times a year - Evita says Mateusz is now much better off. The child benefit and child tax credit they receive via Sebastian in the UK goes much further in their home country thanks to the lower cost of living.

'This is our kingdom. In Poland, food is cheaper than in England. We rent a flat for £350 a month. When we lived in Bristol, we spent £800 a month,' she said. 

'They are very trustful': Evita is delighted she can still get benefits for her son even though he no longer lives in Britain

Apart: Sebastian, left, works at a factory in Bristol so only sees his son a few times a year

She added that she doesn't see anything wrong with her child being supported by British taxpayers.

She said: 'In my opinion, it is absolutely normal to receive benefits from abroad, from United Kingdom. It is where my husband works and I am entitled to claim benefits because of the system.'

Evita said she resents accusations - which come from her fellow Polish people - that she is lazy or a scrounger for taking hand outs from Britain.

She said: 'Polish press say about thieves and scroungers. I'm sad when I read these words about me. It's not true. A lot of Polish comments are that I am lazy, I am counting on benefits only. 

'This is not true. I am hard working mum. I try to be the best mum for my son. It's difficult to read stories about myself and their opinion.'

Hard-working mother: Evita runs her own restaurant so she only spends the money from Britain on 'food, books, toys and entertainment' for her son

As well as looking after her son, Evita has opened her own restaurant near their one bedroom flat in Warsaw. 

She takes home a wage from the business so the £220 a month benefits she gets from the UK are spent solely on her son. In contrast, Polish children only get £20 a month from their government.  

Evita said: 'Mateusz gets only British benefits. I was surprised but this money is extra money for my son.

'Normally, my husband transfers money through Western Union which is very easy. I have money, after the transfer, from Great Britain. I spend this money on Mateusz only. I use it to buy food, books, toys, entertainment... We go to the cinema once a month.'

She said she had no qualms about taking handouts from Britain to spend on her son. 

Lower cost of living: Evita said money goes much further in Poland so they are better off at home

Off to work: The mother says she is not lazy as she works full-time. 'I earn my own money, my business is doing well,' she said

'I know a lot of people spend benefits on useless things, for example smokes and drinks. But look at me - I am a hard-working mum and businesswoman. I earn my own money, my business is doing well,' she said.

Also in tonight's documentary, that will be shown on Channel 5 at 9pm, Romanian father-of-three, Ion, reveals how he came to the UK at the start of 2014 determined to claim thousands of pounds in British benefits. 

Nearly one year on, he estimates that he gets £1,200 worth of benefits a month, and he is spending all of it renovating his family home back in rural Romania.

The programme takes a trip with Ion back to Romania to check the work in progress on his house. 

As the cost of living is cheaper there, the money goes a long way and Ion has bought a new boiler, a water pump and a new bath and toilet. Plenty of work has been completed on the structure of the building – all paid for by British benefits. 

Ion is able to claim the benefits because he has self-employed status as a scrap metal collector in the UK, even if he spends much of his time back home in Romania. Now Ion is signing up his one-year-old son Raoul for child benefit, which he thinks will get him another £500 each month.
