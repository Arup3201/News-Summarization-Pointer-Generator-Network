Welsh rugby player Ian Gough has been found guilty of assaulting his ex-partner, just days after she got engaged to former pop star Dane Bowers.

The 37-year-old attacked Sophia Cahill, 30, as he dropped off their young son outside the home she shares with Mr Bowers in south London earlier this year.

The international rugby star, who is 6ft 5in and weighs nearly 19 stone, was said to have ‘manhandled and shoved’ the mother of his two children, after arriving an hour late to leave the youngest in her and Mr Bowers' care.

Guilty: Ian Gough, 37, attacked ex-girlfriend Sophia Cahill, 30,  a former glamour model who was crowned Miss Wales in 2000,  when dropping off their son in January this year

Ms Cahill, who was crowned Ms Wales in 2000, split up with Gough in 2011 while she was still pregnant with their second child.

The incident took place on January 5 this year, not long after Ms Cahill had announced her engagement to 90s singer Mr Bowers, 34.

Ms Cahill was fighting back tears as she told Croydon Magistrates how the Newport Dragons player shoved her into the passenger door of his white VW campervan a week after she had suffered whiplash in a car accident.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, Ms Cahill said she had been at home with her fiancé and her oldest child, waiting for Gough, who was running late in dropping off their son.

She said: ‘From the house I was looking out the window. He parked at the right exit almost as if he did not want to come in.'

‘It was raining so I went out to the van. I was half expecting Ian to get out but he didn't and was on his phone.

‘It was almost as if he was mocking me by leaving me standing in the rain.

‘My son was in the passenger seat in his car seat. I opened the door and Ian stormed round the front of the van.

‘I
 was a little bit taken aback but wanted to get my son out of the car. 
He was up and round like a shot as I tried to unbuckle him.

‘He grabbed me by the shoulder, the right shoulder, so I did not get to unbuckle my son and shoved me round.'

‘He grabbed me by the shoulder and flung me back and was saying 'Get away'.

‘I went back to get my son and said to him 'No Ian, it's fine, I can get him, it's fine'.

‘I went to get my son again and he got me by the shoulder again and flung me so I hit the door.’

Ms Cahill said Gough then unbuckled their son and handed him to her, after which she fled in tears back to her house where her fiance Mr Bowers was waiting for her.

She called police about ten minutes later and Mr Bowers sent an angry text to Gough, the court heard.

The court was told that former Another Level star Mr Bowers wrote: ‘Did you just lay your ****ing hands on Sophie?’

Mr Bowers earlier told how he had seen the attack from the window of their home.

He
 said: ‘He grabbed Sophie and moved her away from the car. It was 
forceful enough that I wondered ... I couldn’t hear what was said.

‘But in my eyes he had no reason or permission to grab her and move her out of the way.’

Just a few days before the alleged attack Ms Cahill had been in a car accident and suffered whiplash which required hospital treatment.

She told magistrates that Gough’s alleged attack made her injuries worse.

She said: ‘I had existing injuries. I was suffering from whiplash. I was in a car accident and it made it worse.’

Mark Haslam, defending, insisted Gough, of Penllergaer, Swansea, did not attack Ms Cahill but told her not to open the passenger door because he feared it could trigger her back injury.

He also accused the model of being ‘abusive and swearing at’ Gough.

But Ms Cahill denied this saying: ‘Absolutely not. There is absolutely no way I can imagine Ian offering any kind of help to me.’

Gough denied assault by beating at the house in the private street in south Croydon, but was later found guilty.

After the verdict, Mr Bowers tweeted: 'I don't think there is ever a "good" result in situations like this but fingers crossed we can move forward and just concentrate on family!'
