The U.S. Army has filed murder charges against four soldiers in the shooting deaths of an ex-soldier who had been part of their brigade and his girlfriend.

The GIs, who are based in Fort Stewart in Georgia, have been charged with premeditated murder and other crimes under military law, an army spokesman said yesterday.

Soldiers convicted of premeditated murder by a court-martial can be sentenced to death or life in prison. The four were already facing charges in civilian court.

The military action comes nearly four months after fishermen found the bodies of Michael Roark, 19, and Tiffany York, 17.

Both had been shot in the head before they were discovered in December not far from Fort Stewart, where Roark had served in the Army until being discharged just three days before he was killed.

Brett Roark, the victim's father, said: 'If we can get the death penalty, let's go for it. This was one cold-blooded execution.'

A week after the killings, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced it had arrested four soldiers who, like the younger Roark, served in the 4th Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart. They are jailed on the civilian charges.

Sergeant Anthony Peden, 25, and Private Christopher Salmon, 25, both face charges of malice murder; Private First Class Michael Burnett, 26, and Private Isaac Aguigui, 19, are charged with being party to a murder.

As the murders occurred outside the boundaries of Fort Stewart, but the suspects are all soldiers on active duty, both the civilian and military courts can claim jurisdiction.

It is possible to prosecute the accused soldiers simultaneously. Cases often move more quickly through the military system.

Fort Stewart Kevin Larson said the military charges against each soldier also include conspiracy to commit murder and a federal firearms charge, which the military did not immediately explain in detail.

He said military and civilian authorities 'have been in discussions since the incident occurred and have cooperated with each other since the beginning'.

District Attorney Tom Durden, who is leading the state prosecution, said the military charges will not necessarily influence his case.

Asked if he had decided whether to seek the death penalty, Mr Durden said he has yet to decide, but that 'all options are still viable'.

Neither military nor civilian authorities have given a motive for the killings, or provided many details on what happened. Preliminary hearings for the four soldiers in state court were postponed earlier this month.

The exact relationship between the victims and suspects remains hazy.

Fort Stewart officials have said only that Michael Roark and the suspects all served in the same brigade of about 4,000 soldiers. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said only that both victims and the four suspects all knew each other.

It is also unclear why the Army discharged Roark on December 2. His service record shows he enlisted in March 2010 and trained as a cavalry scout before being assigned to Fort Stewart earlier this year. The Army Human Resources Command said only that Roark's discharge was not dishonourable.

Roark's father said his son arrived at Fort Stewart last year as an eager private who was disappointed he did not get to deploy to Iraq with the 4th Brigade, which returned from a year-long tour last summer.

A few months later, the young soldier complained of disagreements with superiors and told his father he wanted to leave the Army.

Brett Roark said his son visited him the weekend before he was killed and did not act distressed or give any sense he was in danger.
