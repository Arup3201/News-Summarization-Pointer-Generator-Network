The most boring calendar for 2015 has hit the shelves - featuring the post boxes of Wales.

Self-confessed 'dull man' Kevin Beresford from Redditch, Worcestershire, came up with the idea to celebrate post boxes which stand in the cities, mountains and valleys of Wales.

It follows his 2014 calendar which featured the telephone boxes of Wales which became a best seller.

Self-confessed 'dull man' Kevin Beresford said that the post office boxes 'things of beauty' and of historical importance

Mr Beresford, 62, said: 'People may think post boxes are a bit dull but I they are things of great beauty and of historical importance.

'You might think that all post boxes are the same but there are over 400 different types.

'The calendar has pictures of post boxes mounted on poles, set into walls, and pillar boxes standing alone on city streets, at the seaside and amongst flower beds on country lanes.'

Mr Beresford visited some of the most important and well-known post boxes in Wales.

And his favourite is a Victorian box in the village of Laugharne, West Wales, which he claims was used by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.

Kevin said: 'People thought my phone box calendar for this year was a bit dull but it became a best seller.

'I think of myself as an artist - the works of some of our greatest artists have celebrated every-day mundane things like Andy Warhol's can of soup or Tracy Emin's unmade bed.

'It might make me a bit dull but I love things post boxes - I see them as crimson iconic receptacles.

'And I am recording a slice of British history which is fast disappearing.

'People aren't using post boxes and telephone kiosks theses days because of emails and mobile phones.'

Kevin has appeared in a calendar himself - he was Mr January in one featuring Britain's most dull men.

He has previously published calendars called the Best of Britain's roundabouts and the Best of Britain's prisons.

Kevin said: 'I live in Redditch which must be the most boring town in Britain and I've been married and divorced three times.

'I think you can probably guess why.'
