A mural of Jesus blessing two military officers has been unveiled after 60 years hidden for being 'too militaristic'.

St Peter's Chelsea Church in Manhattan first displayed the painting by a former colonel in 1946 as a tribute to the men who fought in the brutal Second World War.

Tim Witonski, who enlisted the day after Pearl Harbour, gave 'Our Lord Blessing A Soldier And A Sailor' - one of his many works - to the parish which took him in on his return.

Unveiled: Our Lord Blessing A Soldier And A Sailor has been hidden for 60 years in St Peter's Chelsea Church, Manhattan, after the congregation decided it was 'too militaristic' in 1954

It shows two men kneeling before Christ in their uniform.

But in 1954, as America became embroiled in the Cold War, the congregation ruled the mural was 'too militaristic' and covered it with a curtain.

Home: Peter Witonski, son of artist Colonel Tim Witonski, was partly brought up at the church which took his father in at the end of World War Two

Now, almost 60 years later, the curtain has been drawn to reveal Mr Witonski's masterpiece once more.

Crowds gathered in the chapel during mass at 10am on Remembrance Sunday for the unveiling.

It has shocked most of today's congregation who were unaware the five-foot-tall masterpiece has been hanging by the altar for six decades.

Peter Witonski, his son, applauded the decision.

He told CNN: 'He simply wanted to show that Americans won the war, and here they are - having won the war - not going out and getting drunk, but kneeling down and praying.'

Having moved away in the late 1940s, Mr Witonski, who died in the 1970s, never knew his work was covered up.

'I think he would have been hurt,' his son said. 'It was a labour of love. He did not charge money for it.'

He told CNN he is looking forward to seeing the painting restored to its public place, adding: 'I feel that my father will be watching, somehow.'

Witonski produced a large body of art that has been exhibited by a number of prestigious institutions.

The interim pastor, Stephen Harding, who discovered the piece told CNN that, now unveiled, he hopes the work will give people an opportunity to think about the history of the parish and the nation.

Found: Interim pastor Stephen Harding ordered for the painting to be unveiled when he found it this year

Military support: Pastor Harding, here seen blessing a veteran, has many former servicemen in his congregation

Excited: Peter Witonski,  pictured on Sunday with his wife Anila, said: 'I feel my father will be watching somehow'

The chapel was first leased to the congregation in 1832 by Clement Clarke Moore - who famously wrote 'Twas The Night Before Christmas...

It ran numerous outreach programmes in the 19th century, helping to educate children and support families.

However, when attendance numbers plummeted in post-war 20th century, St Peter's could not support itself as an independent church and in 1954 became a mission of the Diocese of New York.
