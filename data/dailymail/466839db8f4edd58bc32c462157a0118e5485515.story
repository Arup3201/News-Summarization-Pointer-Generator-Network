Dyson is famous for inventing the first cyclone vacuum cleaner as well as a bladeless fan and super-fast hand drier.

And now the British appliance firm has taken to YouTube to tease a new mystery device.

The video shows various ground-level moving robots and engineers tinkering with parts – leading many to speculate that a robotic Roomba-like hoover is on the horizon.

Is this the vacuum cleaner of the future? Dyson has released a video to tease a new product (a still is pictured) but hasn't revealed what it is. The British applicance firm merely said: ‘16 years. 200 engineers. £28 million investment. The result? Tell us what you think it is’

Whatever the product may be, the firm has spent a lot of time and money working on it.

The only snippet of information to accompany the mysterious video, reads: ‘16 years. 200 engineers. £28 million investment. The result? Tell us what you think it is.’

The device is due to be unveiled on September 4. 

Speculating about the upcoming product, one viewer of the video wrote on Dyson’s YouTube page: ‘In this video it looks like lots of different tests of locomotion. There is one with tracks, and one that sort of looks like it is gliding like a hovercraft. Really quite intrigued.’ 

A few seconds in the video (screen grab pictured) appear to show a machine that looks like it has three cloths attached to it - adding weight to predictions that 'Project N223' will be an autonomous cleaning device

Look out! It appears that the device includes a camera with a panoramic view and could include caterpillar tracks. This device could be a camera mounted in a mast

The video shows glimpses of what could be cloths or brushes attached to the base of a robot.

It also shows a camera on a mast with a panoramic view. James Dyson has previously said that a robotic cleaner would navigate using cameras.

The company invested £5 million ($8.2 million) in a lab at Imperial College London designed to help robots ‘understand and adapt to the world around them,’ earlier this year.

Dyson created a prototype robotic cleaner in 2001 – but it was too heavy and expensive to put into production.

Many people associate the Dyson brand with vacuum cleaners, despite it producing other devices such as fans and driers.

Another said: ‘The robot vacuum. I've heard many rumours about Dyson working on this technology. Whatever it is, I know it will be perfectly engineered. ’

If the product is a robotic vacuum cleaner, it will enter a market currently dominated by Roomba, which makes circular autonomous cleaners.

Earlier this year, Dyson invested £5 million ($8.2 million) in a lab at Imperial College London designed to help robots ‘understand and adapt to the world around them,’ The Verge reported, leading may people to speculate that a new robotic product would be coming soon. 

In an interview in February, company founder Sir James Dyson suggested a robotic cleaner might be in the pipeline and would use computer vision to navigate a room.

Doing the locomotion: Speculating about the upcoming product, one viewer of the video wrote on Dyson's YouTube page: 'In this video it looks like lots of different tests of locomotion. There is one with tracks, and one that sort of looks like it is gliding like a hovercraft (pictured). Really quite intrigued.'

No more chores: If Dyson's product is a robotic vacuum cleaner, it will enter a market currently dominated by Roomba, which makes circular autonomous cleaners. This i-robot Roomba 562 model costs £360
