A mother and her daughter who both have a rare condition which makes their skin wrinkle prematurely have undergone matching £50,000 facelifts. 

Tracey Gibson, 45,  and her daughter Zara Hartshorn, 18, both suffer Lipodystrophy, a rare condition which makes fat dissolve beneath tissue. 

While Zara had a face-lift at the age of 16 to stave off bullies, her mother has long suffered lingering stares and cruel nicknames.

Having been rejected by the NHS for a free operation, the mother of seven thought she would be forever trapped in a sinking face. 

But, two years since her daughter received free surgery from American doctors, the 45-year-old has unveiled her new £50,000 face after being flown overseas to receive the same VIP treatment.

After: The mother daughter duo were treated to free surgery by doctors in America after being turned down by the NHS

Speaking of the treatment- a face and neck lift plus Botox injections - Mrs Gibson, who was constantly teased as a child, says she has never felt better. 

'My face is worth £50,000 and it feels absolutely amazing when I get up in the morning,' she said. 

'I’ve been called a "granny" and a "monkey" all my life and when I look at old pictures now I think I looked like the dragon off Shrek.

'But now I’ve got a new lease of life and I can hold my head high when I walk down the street. I think I look pretty good now and totally different.'

Mrs Gibson, who lives off disability allowance, has been plagued with low self-esteem her entire life because of the condition. 

While lipodystrophy can occur as a side effect of various illnesses, a small number of people in the world are born with the condition. 

The results can vary between sufferers. In Mrs Gibson's case her face, neck and arms were the worst affected making her look double her age at times.  

Now the pair say they enjoy better self-esteem and higher levels of confidence despite being turned down by the NHS 

The pair (left, after the procedure and right, in 2011) are among a handful of people afflicted with Lipodystrophy in the UK 

Zara (pictured aged seven) was born with the condition and teased at school. When she was 16 she was contacted by surgeons in America who offered to perform a facelift free of charge

Three of Mrs Gibson's seven children were born with the condition though Zara (left) was the worst afflicted. They are pictured above with her daughter Jolene who also has Lipodystrophy,  in 2012

Mrs Gibson, who has been married three times, said that for the fist time in years she is being chatted up by men. She is pictured three years ago aged 42 with her husband Lawrence and daughters Jolene and Zara

Lipodystrophy affects its sufferers differently, with fat loss occurring in different parts of the body. Mrs Gibson, for example, has more pronounced wrinkles in her arms, neck and face. Above, she poses with Zara (right) before her procedure, and daughter Chloe, who does not have the condition 

'I’ve been ridiculed my entire life and endured all sorts of cruel names since school,' she said. 

'I’ve had to put up with so much. I was never able to get a job and it does make you resentful sometimes.'

Of Tracey’s seven children, three have inherited the rare condition. Jolene, 25 and Tommy, 26, are also sufferers though Zara's symptoms were most prominent. 

The 18-year-old underwent surgery in 2012 after being contacted by a plastic surgeon in the U.S. who performed the operation for free. 

Lipodystrophy also known as the ‘Fat Redistribution Syndrome’, refers to a number of disturbances in the way the body uses and distributes fat.

One of the most common symptoms is fat loss in the face, causing sufferers to appear gaunt and wrinkled far earlier than their peers. 

While it is a common side effect of illnesses such as diabetes, a small number of people are born with the condition.

The dissolving of fat beneath tissue can occur in different body parts in every patient. 

Some will look haggered in the face and thin in the arms while others will see rushes of fat to the hips and legs.

The pair stayed in touch and, after watching her daughter's skin improve, the doctor offered Mrs Gibson, who had already been rejected by the NHS, the same treatment.  

'I got turned down in this country because they said it was just cosmetic and as you can imagine I was absolutely fuming,' she said. 

'I think it’s disgusting that I was born with this condition and the NHS won’t do anything about it.

'I don’t know how they could refuse me - my face looked terrible.' 

And while she was delighted with the facelift and subsequent Botox injections, the 45-year-old stopped short of transforming her whole face. 

'They asked me if I wanted Angelina Jolie lips but I think that would be taking it a bit too far.

'It was never about looking younger, it was just about having a normal face that I could be happy with and stand to look at in the mirror. 

'I love putting my make-up on now and making the most of my new face. I never bothered with anything like that before but now I have a bag full of cosmetics.'

'I feel like I’m having the last laugh now at everyone who called me names and it’s a massive boost.

'I’ve always had my head down trying to blend into the background, but that part of my life is done with now and I can finally be the person I’ve always wanted to be.'
