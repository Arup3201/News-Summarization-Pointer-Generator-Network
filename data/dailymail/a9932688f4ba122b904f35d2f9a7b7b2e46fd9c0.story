A man who gave alcohol to his 12-year-old step-son - and six other minors - before the boy drowned in a Missouri river last year is scheduled to be sentenced today after pleading guilty last month to seven counts of second-degree child endangerment.

Combs guilty plea was not part of any plea deal, according to prosecutors

Prosecutors in the case had initially hoped to charge Todd Combs with manslaughter in the death of 12-year-old Christopher Marks, but toxicology results from the boy's autopsy showed signs of ethanol that was produced during the decomposition process, so investigators were unable to determine how much alcohol Marks had consumed before he drowned.

'It's disappointing that we can't determine the full extent of what 
occurred,' prosecutor Bob McCulloch said at a press conference last year. 'The death of this child was clearly caused 
by (Combs') criminal conduct. Circumstances like this would warrant more
serious charges, but we can only charge what we can prove.'

On August 5, 2012, Combs and Marks attended a family picnic near the Meramec River in St. Louis County, Missouri, with at least six other minors, each of whom was 15 at the time.

Before the picnic, Combs filled a cooler with dozens of beers and other alcohol and provided it to the minors.

When the booze ran out, Combs even went to the store to refill the cooler.Â 

Marks was last seen about 7:30 p.m. swinging on a rope swing near the river.

Once it was determined that Marks was missing, rescuers began a massive search for the boy.

It wasn't until several days later, when Combs and a friend were searching for the boy on jet skis, that his body was recovered several miles from where he was last seen.

According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Combs and the boy's mother have since separated.

'My life's forever changed,' she said. 'I will never be who I was. I will never have normalcy in my life.'
