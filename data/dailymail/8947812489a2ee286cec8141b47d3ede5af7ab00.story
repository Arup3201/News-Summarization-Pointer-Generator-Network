Watching your car being issued with a parking ticket is a frustration known to many of us.

But few drivers will have reacted so dramatically as this man in Walthamstow, east London, who was so incensed to see his car being put on a tow truck, he jumped behind the wheel and reversed straight off it.

These astonishing pictures show the man, who, having returned to find his silver Vauxhall Astra being impounded, was determined to stop it going to the pound.

Dangerous attempt to dodge a parking ticket: A motorist reversed his car off a tow truck at high speed

Landing on the ground three feet below with a thump, the  unidentified man then reversed before speeding off

The footage taken by one of Waltham Forest Council's parking contractors, show the man leap into the driver's seat before the car had been secured to the truck.

It shows him rev the car's engines and then, without looking behind him to see if the road was clear, reversing at full speed, landing on the road with a thud on the road in front of a group of giggling children.

He then drove off.

A spokesman for the council said the matter had been reported to police but neither the motorist nor the car had yet been found, as it appeared the car was not registered to the man who was driving it.

A Met Police spokesman said officers had been called to an altercation between a motorist and parking officials and said four officers had gone to the scene in Hazelwood Road, Walthamstow.

But they said that by the time police arrived, the motorist had driven off.

The spokesman said efforts had been made to trace the motorist but police were no longer involved as it was considered to be a civil matter.

The astonishing incident took place in Hazelwood Road, Walthamstow, early one morning last month

The car hits the ground with a loud thud after reversing off the back of the tow truck at high speed

Watched by a group of parking contractors and giggling schoolchildren, the motorist then reversed away

Going, going, gone: The motorist drove off and despite efforts by the council and police, remains at large

Waltham Forest councillor Clyde Loakes said: 'His actions are shocking.  The man had an utter disregard for anyone on the street and what he did was extremely dangerous.

'You can see kids and other members of the public milling around in the foreground of the video and thank goodness none of them were in the immediate vicinity or he could have killed someone.'

A bystander said: 'There was an almighty crash as he dropped about three feet to the ground - I would think that whatever money he saved on the parkign ticket, he'll have to pay to get his exhaust repaired.'
