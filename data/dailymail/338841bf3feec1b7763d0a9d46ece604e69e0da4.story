It doesn’t matter how many times Facebook updates its privacy and security features, the tools are still criticised for being too complicated to use.

To tackle these complaints, the social network is reportedly testing a new standalone app called Moments.

Moments was designed to let people share posts with select groups, and is said to be an alternative to the complicated privacy settings and audience selector used on the main site.

Facebook employees are reportedly testing a new standalone app called Moments. It was designed to let people share posts with select groups, and is an alternative to the complicated privacy settings and audience menus used on the main app and website (pictured). It is unknown if the app will be released more widely

‘Multiple sources’ toldTechCrunch that the app is currently being tested by Facebook employees, but it is unknown if the app will be released more widely.

The sources claim that Moments is made up of a grid of tiles.

Facebook knows that many people struggle with managing their privacy settings, and recently introduced a privacy checkup tool to make the process more transparent.

The system uses a blue dinosaur which guides Facebook users through three steps to navigate its maze of privacy settings.

The first step lets users to review and change the default audience for their status updates.

It then goes through the privacy options of Facebook-connected apps, and finally reviews and edits different items on a profile. 

Each tile is assigned a select group of people, such as friends, work colleagues or family.

When a user wants to post a status, photo or video, they do so, in one click, by selecting the most appropriate tile.

It is unknown whether multiple tiles can be selected.

Each group can be customised, and the app was designed to be less complicated than trying to manage audiences on the Facebook app or website.

TechCrunch’s Josh Constine said: ‘Moments holds big potential for Facebook if it can buck the trend of its last few standalone apps Paper and Slingshot, which found some loyal users but have been largely ignored by the mainstream user base.

‘Moments will have to provide obvious, instant value far beyond the main Facebook app to get big.’
