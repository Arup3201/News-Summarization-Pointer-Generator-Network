President Barack Obama and the vacationing first family skipped the beach in Hawaii on Sunday to take in a college basketball game.

The President, first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia were in attendance at the Oregon State-Akron game as part of the Diamond Head Classic tournament in Honolulu.

The game held particular interest for the Obamas, as Oregon State is coached by Michelle's brother, Craig Robinson, although at times the first lady and the girls didn't look as excited to be watching the game as the president did.

Can we go now? President Barack Obama and the vacationing first family skipped the beach in Hawaii on Sunday to take in a college basketball game

The president had every reason to smile as he received a much warmer welcome in his home state than he did the last time he took his family to a basketball game back in November.

Then he had been greeted with boos as the family had sat down to watch Oregon State take on the University of Maryland, but in Hawaii the president is treated very much like a returning hero. 

The Obamas drew a standing ovation and loud cheers as they walked in to the small arena at the University of Hawaii.

Fans took pictures while press photographers and videographers crowded an entrance to take pictures. Throughout the game, some fans ignored the action on the floor and watched the president instead.

The arena beefed up security because of the president, screening players and cheerleaders and their belongings with metal detectors in the hours before the tournament tipped off.

In the past President Obama, a noted basketball fan and recreational player, has been something of a lucky charm for his brother-in-law’s team. Before Sunday he had seen them win 4-0, although on Sunday Akon beat Oregon 83:71.

Every year, Obama and his family return to his birth state on the sun-scorched shores of Oahu. And every year - until now - congressional squabbling has forced the Obamas to delay their trip or cut it short.

This year, Obama was cleared for an on-time departure by Congress, which defied pessimistic expectations last week by passing a bipartisan budget deal, all but ensuring the government won't shut down over the next two years.

Holiday starts now: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama disembark Air Force One after arriving at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for their family Christmas vacation on Friday, Dec. 20, 2013, in Honolulu

It was a far cry from presaging a new 
era of cooperation, to be sure, but a silver lining for Obama a day 
earlier as he acknowledged a year of frustrating 'ups and downs' in an 
end-of-year news conference.

The president, first lady Michelle 
Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia, and first dogs Sunny and Bo hopped an 
overnight flight on Friday aboard Air Force One to Honolulu, where they 
were whisked by motorcade to a beachside home in Kailua, a sleepy suburb
 with a five-mile stretch of beach popular among windsurfers and 
tourists.

The next 
morning Obama, typically an early riser, got a late start, staying at 
the home until early afternoon, when he headed to the golf course at a 
nearby Marine Corps base.

Joining Obama for the round of golf were Sam 
Kass, the White House chef; Marvin Nicholson, Obama's trip director; and his friend Titcomb, the White House said.

Obama,
 in white golf shirt, hat and sunglasses, was all smiles as he drove 
past reporters accompanying him to the coastal golf course.

The first family are spending their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii which will cost taxpayers $100,000

The president has no public events scheduled during his vacation, which is expected to last through January 5.

In previous years, frequent golf outings have accompanied trips to local restaurants and other island outings.

A few weeks of low-key rest and relaxation would be a welcome change of pace for Obama, who reflected on a high-stakes year of brinkmanship and health care woes as he packed his bags for Hawaii.

'The end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Obama said Friday. 'I'm sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.'

Last year, Obama had to temporarily abandon his vacation to fly home amid a congressional standoff over the so-called fiscal cliff.

The year before, a showdown over payroll tax cuts forced him to delay the start of his Hawaii hiatus.

In 2010, it was congressional wrangling over repeal of the ban on gays in the military and other issues that delayed the trip. And in 2009, Senate deliberations over Obama's signature health care law meant that Honolulu had to wait another few days.

Conditions seem ripe this year for a few weeks of interrupted family time.

Obama did spend part of Saturday morning conferring with top national security aides about the situation in South Sudan, where U.S. military aircraft evacuating Americans from the violence-plagued African nation came under gunfire and had to divert to Uganda.

The White House said four U.S. troops were injured in that incident.

Throughout his vacation Obama will continue to get regular briefings from advisers traveling with him, White House officials said.

Obama and his supporters were hoping those routine updates wouldn't interfere with regular rounds of golf and family outings for shave ice, the Hawaii version of a snow cone.

'I don't want any interruptions. He deserves a vacation,' Brian Pritchett, an assistant principal visiting from Mount Vernon, New York, said as he sipped a rum-infused drink dubbed the 'Obama Mama' at a Honolulu hotel.

'He puts in too many hours to not have his vacation with his family. I know that's what I would do.'
