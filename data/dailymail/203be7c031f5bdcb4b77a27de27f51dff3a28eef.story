A group of Royal Marines have quite literally 'gone commando' - by launching a raunchy charity calendar.

Serving members of 40 Commando RM in Taunton, Somerset, stripped off to raise money for an armed forces' charity before being posted to Afghanistan.

Incredibly, they did all the work themselves - directing and photographing the arty pictures.

The calendar is for the 'Go Commando'
charity, which was founded in 2010 to provide support to serving Royal 
Marines and their families.

Once it was completed, the unit’s own
photographer Rhys O'Leary had to send the photographs back to the from 
his base in Afghanistan to get them approved by the Royal Navy.

Authorities gave them the green light
and it is hoped the 2013 calendar will help the charity with its target
of raising £50,000.

The Royal Marine Commandos, who 
cannot be named for operational reasons, described the photoshoot as 'a 
challenge which was far from a normal day’s work'.

Debbie Howarth, the PR spokesperson 
for Go Commando, said that while the calendar is fun and raunchy, there 
is a serious message behind it.

She said: 'Being a wife, partner or 
parent with a loved-one serving in a military unit can be extremely 
stressful and the reality of caring for an injured husband or partner is
an unfortunate fact of life faced by many courageous women.

'This is proving a great morale boost
for the lads over in Afghanistan who tragically lost one of their 
colleagues - Cpl David O'Connor - together with three others working on 
attachment to 40 Commando within the past couple of weeks.

Our thoughts are with their families.'
