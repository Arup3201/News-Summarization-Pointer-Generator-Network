Olympic swimmer Amy Van Dyken-Rouen is getting back in the pool as part of her rehabilitation.

The six-time gold medalist, who severed her spine in an ATV accident earlier this month, tweeted that she was excited to learn she would be swimming - and used the hashtag #Freedom - before she shared an image of her wearing her goggles in her hospital bed.

The 41-year-old has shown almost superhuman strength as she endures a painstaking recovery and continues to show resolve as she embarks on months of rehab and using a wheelchair.

Revealing just how far she has come, on 
Monday she posted a photo of herself standing up with the help of a frame at Craig Hospital in suburban Denver, where she arrived 
last week.

Back to the pool! Olympian Amy Van Dyken Rouen, who severed her spine in an ATV accident earlier this month, has learned that she will be swimming as part of her rehab - and shared photos of her preparation

Her accident left
 her paralyzed just below the waist and the odds of her ever walking 
again are long - but she has impressed her doctors and fans with her 
positive attitude.

When her husband, former Denver 
Broncos punter Tom Rouen, found her, Van Dyken-Rouen was lying face down
 and not breathing.

She began to breathe again after a witness lifted 
her head and was airlifted to a Scottsdale hospital after being 
stabilized by emergency personnel.

'Yes,
 this injury sucks and yes, things hurt, but I'm alive and I'm so 
thankful to be alive, so that's why I can be positive about it,' Van 
Dyken-Rouen said from a stretcher during her first news conference since
 the accident. 'It helps get me through the pain.'

Fighter: On Monday, Van Dyken, who is paralyzed from the accident, shared this image of her standing with the caption: 'OMG... I'm standing. I have a lot of help, but I'm still up! #werl'

New life: At the weekend, she shared this image of her first full day in rehab, saying: 'A good day, but tired'

Support: She also shared this picture at the weekend showing her enjoying a picnic with her husband and dog

Van
 Dyken-Rouen was injured when the ATV she was driving hit a curb and 
sent her hurtling over an embankment near Show Low on June 6.

Once at the hospital, doctors discovered she had a fracture dislocation of the T11 vertebrae, which had subluxed almost entirely over the T12 vertebrae. The dislocated vertebrae also severed Van Dyken-Rouen's spinal cord and caused a spinal fluid leak.

Because of the severity of Van Dyken's injury, her doctor told her to say goodbye to her husband because there was a chance she would not make it through surgery.

'It was one of those things where I 
looked at my husband and said, "I love you, goodbye, please continue on 
with your life",' Van Dyken said in an interview.

During more than six hours of surgery, doctors moved Van Dyken-Rouen's dislocated vertebrae back into place millimeters at a time to prevent a potentially-fatal rupture of her heart. They drilled screws into four vertebrae, inserted rods to stabilize her spine and patched the spinal fluid leak.

The surgery was designed to stabilize not restore function, and Van Dyken-Rouen said she is still unable to feel anything from about her pubic bone down.

She still faces an arduous road of rehabilitation and long odds for ever walking again, but will not back down whatever happens.

In the short term, Van Dyken-Rouen 
plans to buy the best wheelchair available, plaster it with 
skull-and-bones stickers, paint it purple and dye her hair to match.

Long term, she will do whatever it takes.

'It's almost like a rebirth,' Van Dyken-Rouen said. 'I get to learn how to do everything all over again and I'm anxious to do that. It's time to start so I can get back to Arizona and continue my life - start my new life, I guess.'

Van Dyken Rouen has been keeping her fans and supporters abreast with her progress through her Twitter and Instagram accounts.
