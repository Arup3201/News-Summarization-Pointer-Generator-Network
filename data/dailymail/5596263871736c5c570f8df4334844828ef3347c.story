A paraplegic veteran gave his wife the best surprise of her life when he got out of his wheelchair for the first time to dance with her at their wedding.

Sgt. Joey Johnson, of Fishers, Indiana, served in Afghanistan for almost a year, and came back suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Needing a rush, he bought a motorcycle, and shortly thereafter got into a horrible accident, severing his spinal cord.

He can now no longer feel anything below his chest.

Dancing the night away: Sgt. Joey Johnson gave his new bride Michelle (above) the best surprise of her life when he stood up out of his wheelchair for the first time to dance at their wedding

Beautiful sight: Michelle said 'there was not a dry eye in the room' as Joey got up in his special harness almost two years after he became a paraplegic following a motorcycle accident

Dream come true: Michelle can be seen crying as she dances with her new husband

Fate: Michelle and Joey say they knew they were meant to be together when they learned that they shared the same birthday

This all happened just four months after he met his now-wife, Michelle Johnson, and the two stayed together, with Joey proposing in April 2013 and the couple getting married on on June 28, 2014 - the day before both their birthdays. 

'He had to learn a different way of life with him and his chair: from showering, getting dressed and trying to function every day,' explained Michelle. 

'But we are soul mates.' 

And, as a big surprise to his soul mate on their wedding day, Joey, 27, managed to create a harness that would allow him to get out of his wheelchair and have his first dance with his new bride.

'If you know Joey, he cannot keep a secret. But he made my dreams come true and I never knew how special our day would really be,' Michelle, 27, told ABC News. 

After cutting their wedding cake, Michelle's mother and mother-in-law whisked her away to the bridal suite while Joey got ready for the big reveal.

'I kind of knew something was going on, but I really never knew what was to come,' said Michelle.

She found out what exactly was up moments later, when she walked in to find her groom standing up and ready to dance. 

'Everyone was crying in the room,' said Michelle. 

'It was so amazing to be eye to eye with him again and such a dream come true.'

Even better, the whole thing was filmed for the couple by their friend Jennifer Traynor and photographed by Linnea Liz.
