A masterful front-running ride from Ryan Moore, who partners Tapestry in Sunday's Arc, helped lift Sir Michael Stoute-trained Integral to a length win in the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket.

The daughter of 2003 Arc winner Dalakhani, who also landed the Group One Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket in July, beat Andre Fabre’s 1,000 Guineas winner Miss France with Fabre’s Fintry third.

Integral could now run in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot’s Champion Day a fortnight on Saturday.

Stoute said: ‘We’ll have to see how she comes out of this. We might take our chance.

‘She did a nice piece of work about 10 days ago with Ryan and we were very happy with that. She made it in the Falmouth, so she’s very versatile.

‘You can ride her any way, but I love her with a lead. She’s got a great kick.’
