A talented pitching prospect for the Seattle Mariners has died after he was hit by a boat in his native Venezuela.

Victor Sanchez, 20, was swimming near the Playa Medina in the city of Carupano on February 14 when the propeller struck him in the head.

The rising star, who signed for the MLB franchise when he was just 16, was taken to a local hospital with multiple skull fractures and a cranial hematoma and underwent surgery.

Doctors then placed him in an induced coma and transferred him to a larger facility in the country's capital, Caracas, but he failed to recover from his extensive injuries and died on Saturday.
