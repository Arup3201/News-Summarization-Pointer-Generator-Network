Ronald Koeman has been named Barclays Manager of the Month for January after guiding Southampton to victories over Arsenal and Manchester United.

The Saints won all of their three Premier League games, including a narrow win at Newcastle, to remain in contention for a top-four finish.

Southampton currently lie fourth, one point behind United and one ahead of Arsenal.

After an impressive January, Southampton have endured a mixed February, opening with a defeat by Swansea before edging out Queens Park Rangers.

Koeman's men were held to a goalless draw by 10-man West Ham on Wednesday and, having been knocked out of the FA Cup by Crystal Palace, return to league action next weekend when they host Liverpool at St Mary's.

Southampton will welcome back a number of familiar faces after Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert all left for Anfield last summer.

And Nathaniel Clyne believes the clash could prove vital in the top-four race.

'It is another game we're looking forward to playing,' he said. 'We know Liverpool are a good side.

'It is going to be another tough test for us, but I am sure if we play like we did (against West Ham) we can go and get the three points we're looking for.'

Put to Clyne that the match looked important in the top-four battle, he said: 'Yeah, definitely.

'If we get the win then we can push for that top four and hopefully we can stay there for the rest of the season.'
