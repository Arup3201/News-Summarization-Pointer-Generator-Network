Arsene Wenger will have Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta fully fit and firing for Wednesday’s Champions League trip to Anderlecht, with Theo Walcott not far behind.

But on this evidence, it’s the defensive cavalry that Arsenal desperately need at the moment.

The Gunners had 25 shots on goal during Saturday’s draw with Hull, dominating for all but two moments – the two moments when clinical Hull breached their makeshift back line to earn a point.

One plus side is that Aaron Ramsey (as well as Mikel Arteta) is back and fit for the game against Anderlecht

Mohamed Diame has scored four goals from just four shots on target in the Premier League this season. 

‘I think the way we concede goals at the moment is too easy,’ Wenger complained afterwards. ‘In these kind of games, when you defend you can’t afford this kind of mistake. You cannot concede a goal like we did, it is simple.

‘Where we were guilty I don’t think was in the build-up – we have shown some great quality today – but where we are guilty is to give two goals away from nothing.’

Wenger had a point. Mohamed Diame muscled his way past three defenders to score Hull’s first and Abel Hernandez towered above Per Mertesacker to head home their second.

Aside from that, Hull barely crossed the half-way line, retreating further and further back until Danny Welbeck finally rescued Arsenal in stoppage time.

Shorn of the injured Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy, and the suspended Calum Chambers, Arsenal fielded 19-year-old Hector Bellerin on the right and left-back Nacho Monreal alongside Mertesacker in the middle.

With Debuchy out for some time and a difficult call to make on whether or not to send Koscielny for surgery on a troublesome Achilles, Wenger needs to reinforce his rearguard and January can’t come soon enough.

Anderlecht missed the chance to pull five points clear in the Belgian Pro League as they were held 1-1 at Mechelen on Saturday.

Alessandro Cordaro put the hosts ahead midway through the first-half but Steven Defour replied just after the hour to preserve Anderlecht’s four-point advantage at the top.

Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk and Hull’s Andrew Robertson are two possible targets, though Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels would be ideal. Dinamo Zagreb’s Marcelo Brozovic, a deep-lying midfielder, could also be brought in to protect the defence. 

The contrast between now and a year ago is apparent. Arsenal have conceded 11 in the Premier League so far, just two more than at this stage last season.

But those 11 have been more evenly spread and five of their eight matches have been draws. 12 months ago, they had won six of eight and sat top of the table.

Presently, Chelsea and Manchester City are disappearing over the horizon and this comes after Arsenal spent £77m strengthening in the summer.

‘Look, I don’t look at Chelsea,’ said Wenger bluntly. ‘I look at our performance. It’s a shame that we didn’t win today and it’s a shame because there is a good spirit in the side, a lot of quality in there.

‘Let’s focus on winning the next game. Football is made of pragmatism and realism so let’s focus to go to Anderlecht and win the game.’

Pragmatically and realistically, the title is already gone and the Champions League might not provide much comfort this week. Anderlecht are four points clear in Belgium and unbeaten in the league, though they have struggled in Europe.

Ramsey came on for half-an-hour on Saturday and Arteta was on the bench, so both should be available. Walcott completed 45 minutes for the Under 21s on Friday night after nine months out but the trip to Belgium could come too soon.

The contrast between now and the ‘Invincibles’ team of 10 years ago was not a subject Wenger was willing to address when asked, but 4,700 miles away in Goa, a member of that fabled team hit the nail on the head.

When Robert Pires, now with Goa in the Indian Super League, was asked if Arsenal could still win the Premier League, he said: ‘It’s very difficult. The current squad lacks the physical power the Invincibles team had in players like Sol Campbell, Patrick Vieira, Gilberto Silva and Thierry Henry.’

That was evident – Diame’s goal aside - as they hammered away at Hull’s tightly-packed defence in a second-half siege, trying to score the perfect goal rather than go direct, to the growing annoyance of the crowd.

Even Wenger admitted: ‘We have to score the ‘super goal’ always. On corners, I don’t know how many corners we had today [they had 10, all wasted] but they were much taller and there were not many chances to score.’

The Frenchman insisted Arsenal had progressed in the last few years, but it’s Hull who are making the real strides.

Steve Bruce, who was later spotted on the Piccadilly line heading to Euston and then Manchester for Sam Allardyce’s 60th birthday bash, was satisfied despite Welbeck’s late blow.

‘I’m pleased with the progress we’ve made, it’s been a quite remarkable couple of years,’ he said. ‘For goodness sake, we’re disappointed that we didn’t win at the Emirates. That wouldn’t have been possible two years ago.

‘We’ve got to keep moving with it because every other team does and we’ve probably gone quickly that everyone else but we’ve set ourselves some really, really high standards.’ 

The result was a positive one for Hull boss Steve Bruce - he said his players have set 'really high standards'
