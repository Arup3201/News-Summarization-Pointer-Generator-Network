A 22-year-old man was found dead on Sunday after he lost control of his Porsche and plummeted several hundred feet to the bottom of a canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains.

The man, who has not been named, was speeding westbound on Piuma Road, in Malibu, California when he crossed into the eastbound lane and careened down a steep embankment. 

According to the California Highway Patrol, the man was driving a 1998 Porsche and it was 11 a.m. when he lost control of the high performance car.

Crash: The first responders lowered a paramedic from a helicopter to the car. County fire crews later removed the man from the car.

Sole victim: 'A fire department paramedic was lowered to the vehicle from a rescue helicopter and he determined that there was one victim.'

The driver who has only been identified as a 'resident of Foster City,' was pronounced dead at the scene, The Los Angeles Times reported.

No one else was inside the car, but the California Highway Patrol said he was traveling through the mountains with acquaintances in other vehicles.

The first responders lowered a paramedic from a helicopter to the car. County fire crews later removed the man from the car.

A spokesman for the Malibu Search and Rescue Team told The Malibu Times: 'Upon arrival, rescuers found a vehicle resting at the bottom of a canyon several hundred feet below Piuma Road.' 

'A fire department paramedic was lowered to the vehicle from a rescue helicopter and he determined that there was one victim.'

The L.A. County coroner's office will not release the man's identity until they notify his next of kin.
