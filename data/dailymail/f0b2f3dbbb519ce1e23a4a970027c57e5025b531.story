A South African has cycled around the world carrying a mini-Olympic torch - taking photos of himself in front of famous landmarks.

Sean Conway, 31, from North London, spent five gruelling months pedalling his way through 25 countries in six continents, covering 16,000 miles in the process.

And despite being mown down at 50mph by a pick-up truck just 4,000 miles into his epic trip, he still managed to complete his journey last week.

Mr Conway
said: 'It was by far the toughest thing I’ve done. I’ve ridden through 
deserts where the nearest place to get a drink or eat was 200km away. 
I’ve been hit by a truck at 50mph and chased by wild dogs.

‘But in true Olympic style I persevered and hopefully I brought a bit of the Games’ spirit too.'

Mr
Conway had set out in a bid to break the round the world cycling 
record, but had his dreams shattered when a truck ploughed into him in 
Arkansas.

The
accident left him nursing a compression fracture to his spine, severe 
whiplash, concussion, torn ligaments, twisted ankles and a chipped 
tooth.

But after a 25-day 
lay-off, Mr Conway clambered back on his bike and completed another 
12,000miles - taking photos of the mini-Olympic flame, crafted by 
children at Prendergast-Ladywell Fields College in South London, in 
front of landmarks as he went.

Among
the iconic spots to feature in the background as he held the flame 
aloft are Italy's Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Sydney Opera House and a 
dirt-track road in the Peruvian wilderness.

Mr Conway added: 'Everything was going to plan up to 4,000 miles, I was well ahead of the world record by a long way.

'But then the bloke hit me at 50mph from behind while on his mobile.

'The
impact sent me flying onto the windscreen before sliding onto the 
ground as he braked. My helmet and bike were both wrecked - without my 
helmet on I’d definitely have died.

'I
can’t remember waking up that morning, the first thing I can recall 
from that day was the ambulance men leaning over me and saying you’ve 
been hit.

'Incredibly they later told me my first words were, “How’s the bike?!"

'The accident put me out for about 25 days so that kind of ruined my world record attempt. But I was determined to carry on.'

Mr Conway was cared for by an Arkansas family called the Careys after his release from hospital.

The generous family even donated a bike to help him get back to London in time for the Games.

Mr Conway added: 'The bike was a complete write-off. If it wasn’t for the American family donating me a new bike I’d have been on the next flight home.'

The former photographer arrived back on July 16 and now plans to give motivational speeches.

He said: 'I only arrived back in London last week so I cut it fine in the end. I wanted to promote the Olympics and sport and share the spirit of London with the world.'
