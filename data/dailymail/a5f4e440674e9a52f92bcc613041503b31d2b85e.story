The Chicago train operator who derailed a commuter train sending it up an escalator was asleep at the wheel and had been caught nodding off at work on a previous occasion, it has emerged.

The operator admitted the frightening lapse, which saw 30 people injured, during interviews with investigators, Ted Turpin from National Transportation Safety Board announced today.

'She did admit that she dozed off prior to entering the station, and she did not awake again until the train hit close to the end of the bumper,' Turpin said.

Sleepy: The operator admitted the frightening lapse, which saw 30 people injured, during interviews with investigators, Ted Turpin, pictured today, from National Transportation Safety Board announced

'This time, she woke up when she hit.'

But it wasn't the first time she fell asleep while driving, he said.

The woman, who hasn't been identified, had been admonished just last month for missing a stop because she had dozed off.

'She did tell us that, in February, she dozed off and passed a station without stopping. CTA became aware of that almost immediately, and a supervisor admonished her and had a discussion with her,' Turpin said.

He said she told investigators she woke up 'just a little past the station' but was unable to open the doors.

Turpin said the woman was hired by the CTA in April and began training to be an operator in October. She had been working just 60 days when the awful collison took place, mainly as a fill-in driver so her schedule was iregular, he said.

The news comes as it was revealed the commuter train was not speeding and emergency brakes on the tracks were activated but failed.

Lucky: More than 30 people were injured during the collision at 3am on Monday but thankfully none died

More than 30 people were injured in the 
collision at O'Hare International Airport after the train derailed and 
barreled towards the entrance to the terminals shortly before 3am on 
Monday.

Amalgamated Transit Union Local 308 President Robert Kelly said earlier that the operator told him she had worked a lot of overtime recently and was 'extremely tired'.

'The indication [that she dozed off] is there, yes,' Mr Kelly said during a news conference Monday.

'She has worked a lot of hours in the past weekend, and the indication is there.'

Ted Turpin said a preliminary review had shown the train was operating at 25mph, the correct speed, as it entered the station, according to Newser.

Investigators have yet to say whether the driver attempted to apply the in-cab brake.

Mr Turpin said that 'all we know factually' is that an automatic emergency braking system on the tracks was activated but did not stop the train as it arrived into the station.

Although she had had 17 hours off 
before starting her shift on Sunday night, Mr Kelly said she had been 
working a lot of overtime.

'So she had an ample amount of time to be off that day,' Mr Kelly told the Chicago Tribune.

'I do know she works a lot, as a lot of our members do.'

After the crash, she immediately got off the train began checking on passengers.

The driver was treated for an injury to her leg and released from a local hospital. According to the Tribune, the driver underwent routine drug and alcohol testing.

Martinez Butler, a train engineer for another company, said he witnessed the collision.

'There was a train that was stopped at the station. Another train came through and looked like it blew the signal, because I heard beeping,' she told NBC Chicago. 'I'm a locomotive engineer. I know the systems, I know the sounds.

'When you hear those beepings it's warning you that there is an obstruction in front of you and you need to stop.'
