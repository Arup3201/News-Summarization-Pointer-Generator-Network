Tragic: Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in her own home in Valley Springs, California, last month

A day before a 12-year-old boy was arrested for the stabbing to death of his 8-year-old sister, his mother described him as ‘protective’ of his younger sibling.

Leila Fowler's killing last month shook the quiet community of Valley Springs, southeast of Sacramento, and set off an intense manhunt.

Her brother was in the home at the time and told police he saw a man run from the scene.

Days later, the boy appeared with his father and stepmother at a vigil for his sister. On Friday, as speculation in the community built that perhaps the boy was involved, his biological mother told Sacramento television station KOVR her son ‘could never hurt his sister.’

'I've never seen him be mean to her,' said Priscilla Rodriquez.

Less than a day later, police delivered the stunning news: The 12-year-old boy had been arrested and will be charged with homicide.

For a community still reeling from the killing, the news was another blow.

'It's bad enough to lose a child. I can't imagine losing a child by one of my own children,' Patti Campbell, a longtime area resident and owner of Campbell's Country Kitchen, told The Associated Press.

Campbell, a resident of the area for 33 years and the operator of the Valley Springs restaurant for 15 of them, said she had served Leila and her family in her restaurant.

‘It's just shocking. I don't know what else to say,’ Campbell said.

Other residents in the community of about 7,400 people expressed similar feelings of disbelief.

‘I did not want to believe it. You kind of thought so, but it's not something you want to believe,’ resident Tammy Ainsworth told Sacramento's KCRA-TV.

Aaron Plunk, a neighbor of Fowler's, said the arrest was staggering but he could rest easier now. He said he and his family had been extra vigilant about locking windows and doors, even though the street was being closely guarded by deputies.

‘I think we were the safest house in the county,’ Plunk told the Modesto Bee.

Plunk's mother, Carla Plunk, said she had been scared enough to arm herself.

‘It's the first time I ever held a gun,’ she said.

Calaveras Unified School District Superintendent Mark Campbell said counselors will be available Monday at all schools.

The district ‘stands ready to provide whatever level of support and assistance is necessary to the Fowler family’ and the community at large, he said Sunday.

Horrifying: Leila Fowler's 12-year-old brother was at their home with her in Valley Springs around noon on Saturday when he claimed he had encountered the intruder, who immediately fled

Police released no information about 
what led them to arrest the unidentified 12-year-old for the April 27 
attack. Following the crime, investigators did a door-to-door sweep of 
homes, storage sheds and horse stables scattered across the oak-studded 
hills foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Divers also searched two nearby 
reservoirs in search of clues.

Leila's brother told police he found 
his sister's body and encountered an intruder in the home while their 
parents were at a Little League game. He described the man as tall with 
long gray hair. A neighbor told detectives she saw a man flee the home, 
but she later recanted the story.

Police said there was no sign of a 
burglary or robbery. As part of the investigation, authorities seized 
several knives from the Fowler home, where Leila lived with her father, 
stepmother and siblings.

Calaveras County Sheriff Gary Kuntz 
said authorities spent more than 2,000 hours on the investigation before
they arrested the boy at 5:10 p.m. Saturday

The boy, who has not been identified,
will be charged with homicide, Calaveras County Sheriff Gary Kuntz told
reporters on Saturday.

April 27 attack on Leila Fowler shook the tightknit Valley Springs 
community of about 7,400 people and set off a massive manhunt.

Divers also searched two nearby reservoirs in search of clues.

As
part of the investigation, authorities seized several knives from the 
home Leila shared with her father, stepmother and siblings to determine 
if one could have inflicted the fatal wounds.

A neighbor who told detectives she saw a man flee the Fowler home later recanted the story and was discredited by police.

Leila's brother was taken into custody at 5:10 p.m. Saturday and police hastily called a news conference to announce the arrest.

‘Citizens of Calaveras County, you can sleep a little better tonight,’ Kuntz said.

Authorities spent over 2,000 hours on
the investigation ‘to provide Leila Fowler's family answers to her 
death,’ the sheriff said.

Kuntz said the investigation was ongoing. He declined to provide further details.

Several days after the killing, 
hundreds of people gathered at Jenny Lind Elementary School where Leila 
was a popular 3rd grader. Her mother, Krystal Walters, tearfully thanked
the crowd for the support.

‘I just want to thank the entire 
community and all of our family and friends for all the overwhelming 
amount of support you've given our family,’ Walters said at the time. 
‘It will never be forgotten. Thank you.’

Calaveras County Deputy Coroner Steve
Moore said the girl died from multiple stab wounds. They have not 
revealed how many times she was stabbed or where.

Violent crime is so rare in the 
community of 7,400 people that even law enforcement officers have to 
stop and think when asked about the last time there was a stranger 
killing in the area.

'Probably five years ago was the last one I can remember,' said Officer 
Rebecca Myers of the California Highway Patrol, who was assigned to 
block access to the neighborhood of one-acre ranchettes.
