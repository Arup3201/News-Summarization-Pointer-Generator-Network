A man has died and seven people were injured after a bus crashed in a deluge of near-boiling water which had flooded the streets of a Swedish city.

A cloak of thick stream shrouded the centre of Lund on Friday evening, after gallons of 88C water burst out from a broken heating pipe and swamped the city centre.

The reduced visibility is believed to have caused a bus driver to lose control of his vehicle and plough into a group of pedestrians, including the man who died.

A burst heating pipe caused a deluge of near-boiling water to flood the streets of Lund, Sweden on Friday

The water, which was said to be about 88C, caused the city to become shrouded in a cloak of thick steam

Witnesses reported seeing the vehicle careering down the street with sparks flying from underneath, believed to have been caused by a crushed bicycle.

It was later confirmed that one man died while a further seven people were treated for minor injuries at Skåne University Hospital.

Police are still investigating whether the bus crash and the flooding were linked. The emergency services believe the source of the leak was a fractured district heating pipe.

Nils Norling at Skåne police told Swedish website The Local: 'When you see a bus approaching careering in that manner and hear people screaming and see somebody lying in one place and someone lying in another, then it all becomes rather overwhelming.'

He added: 'Units have reported almost zero visibility.' 

The crash was reported to police at around 7.15pm, an hour after the flooding began. Officers cordoned off the area while investigations took place.

Meanwhile, local residents were seen using wooden pallets to walk precariously down the flooded streets to avoid  burning themselves.

Witness Lina Aspegren told the TT news agency said: 'I don't know what I can say. It is totally crazy. There is water everywhere. It's unreal.'

Energy firm Kraftringen also posted on its website: 'We ask you to be very attentive to the water from the district heating leakage and avoid coming into contact with this as it has a temperature of 88 degrees'. 

Lund is a town in the southern province of Scania, and is home to Lund University, one of Scandanavia's largest institutions for education.
