Inflation yesterday fell to its lowest level for more than four years, in a further sign that the punishing squeeze on family finances is easing.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the Consumer Prices Index dipped from 2 per cent in December to 1.9 per cent last month.

It was the first time since November 2009 that inflation has been below the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target, and fuelled hopes that the cost of living crisis is coming to an end as the economy picks up.

The Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation has fallen to 1.9 per cent, but is still around twice average pay rises

The drop in inflation will give the Bank more breathing space to leave interest rates at the all-time low of 0.5 per cent.

It
 traditionally raises rates to combat high inflation. City analysts 
hailed Britain as the ‘Goldilocks’ economy as the combination of low 
inflation and strong growth suggested it was ‘not too hot and not too 
cold’.

Bank Governor Mark Carney last week labelled the UK ‘one of 
the strongest economies in the advanced world’ as he raised growth 
forecasts for this year from 2.8 to 3.4 per cent. He also insisted that 
rates ‘may need to stay at low levels for some time to come’.

David 
Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘The 
fall in inflation is very good news for businesses and consumers. An 
early rise in interest rates is neither necessary nor likely.’

David Cameron tweeted in response to the inflation figures

But 
in a sign that millions of households continue to feel the strain, 
prices are still rising faster than wages, with workers getting an 
average pay rise of just 0.9 per cent.

Another measure of inflation –
 the Retail Prices Index, which takes mortgage costs and rising house 
prices into account – ticked up from 2.7 per cent in December to 2.8 per
 cent last month. It is hoped, however, that wages will finally overtake
 prices in the coming months following the longest squeeze on household 
incomes for at least 50 years.

Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital 
Economics, said: ‘There is a good chance that CPI inflation will fall to
 as low as 1 per cent by the end of this year and remain subdued 
thereafter. This should enable real earnings to rise for the first year 
since 2007 and allow the Bank to keep interest rates on hold until well 
into next year.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said the fall in the 
headline measure of CPI inflation – from as high as 5.2 per cent in 
September 2011 – was ‘more evidence our long-term economic plan is 
working’.

The dip in inflation last month was driven by falling DVD 
prices and lower entrance fees to attractions such as museums, as well 
as discounts on household goods and furniture. The traditional 
post-Christmas rise in whisky prices was also less than expected.

Discounts on furniture and lower than expected rises in the cost of whiskey were the main drivers in the inflation fall

The Consumer Prices Index  measures inflation using a representative ‘shopping basket’ of goods.

This includes items ranging from everyday essentials such as bread to other expenditures like air fares. But critics claim CPI is not a true reflection of the cost of living as it does not include housing expenses such as rent and mortgage interest payments.

These are part of the alternative Retail Prices Index (RPI) – which has risen from 2.8 to 2.9 per cent, partly because of the effect of soaring house prices in the South East.

In 2003, the then Chancellor Gordon Brown adopted the CPI measure as it was more comparable internationally and considered  to give a better picture  of underlying spending  patterns without the distortion of house prices.

The lower figure of CPI is also convenient for the Government as it is used to dictate increases in pensions, benefits and public sector wages.
