An Ohio man who raped and killed his nine-year-old neighbor was sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison without parole.

Jerrod Metsker pleaded guilty to murdering Reann Murphy, whose body was found dumped in a trash can at the trailer park where they both lived.

The nine-year-old had last been seen building a snowman with Metsker, just hours before she disappeared on December 14 last year.

Plea deal: Jerrod Metsker has been sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to raping and murdering his nine-year-old neighbor

Victim: Reann Murphy's body was found buried under trash one day after she had been seen building a snowman with Metsker

A plea deal was agreed with Metsker, who has a low IQ, after his victim's parents said they did not want to pursue the death penalty.

Under the deal Metsker, who was described in court as a family friend, pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and rape. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

The county sheriff's office had said early in its investigation that Metsker had a 'diminished mental capacity' but declined to reveal further details of his condition.

The 24-year-old had been the one to call 911 on the day Reann died, and had joined neighbors in the search for the missing girl.

Guilty: Metsker, pictured right during a hearing in December last year, was charged with aggravated murder

Heartbroken: Reann with her family. Her parents told the court they didn't want to pursue the death penalty

Crime scene: Police search the trailer park where Reann and Metsker both lived at the time of her murder in December 2013

One day later, Reann's body was found in a dumpster at the Smithville trailer park where she lived.

Loss: Reann was described by family as a firecracker who loved to be outside

She had been sexually assaulted and 
strangled, most likely in Metsker's trailer home which he shared with 
his mother, prosecutors said.

Metsker often played outside with children who lived at the trailer park, and would build playhouses out of blankets, neighbors said.

He met Reann when she moved to the trailer park with her mother at the start of the school year.

Reann's mother had been at work on the Saturday that she went missing. She had left her daughter in the care of her live-in boyfriend.

The nine-year-old had gone outside to play in the snow with other children in the trailer park, but when the others went home she was left alone with Metsker.

Relatives described Reann as a tomboy and said that she had loved to play outside.

'She was a little firecracker, always ready to wrestle and play,' her cousin Paula Watts said. 'She wasn't into girlie stuff.'

Although she lived with her mother, she still spent plenty of time with her father, Richard Murphy, who described her as 'the best thing that ever happened to me'.

Problems: Police described 24-year-old Metsker as having a low IQ. He often played with neighborhood children
