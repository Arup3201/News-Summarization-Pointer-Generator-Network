The Norwegian wonderkid who is attracting attention from several of Europe's top clubs will go on trial with Liverpool before Christmas.

Martin Odegaard, who last month became the youngest player in European Championships history at the age of 15, will spend a week at the club, who he has supported all his life.

But Brendan Rodgers will face plenty of competition if he wants to sign the schoolboy, who has already undergone a similar trial with Real Madrid and has offers from Ajax and Manchester United.

And in a recent interview Odegaard also paid tribute to Bayern Munich, who he described as 'the best club in the world' sparking speculation that Germany could be his preferred destination. 

The 15-year-old attacking midfielder, dubbed the 'new Messi' in Norway, plays for Tippeligaen club Stromsgodset, and is unlikely to move abroad immediately. 

He has to juggle homework with training and playing, but Odegaard promises he's  taking it easy with a big future in mind.

'If you get carried away now, you won't get far in 10 years,' Odegaard adds. 'I'm supposed to be at my best then, not now. That I know.'
