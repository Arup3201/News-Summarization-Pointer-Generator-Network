London Welsh fell to their sixth consecutive defeat in the Aviva Premiership as they were convincingly beaten 23-3 by Newcastle at the Kassam Stadium.

Newcastle dominated and showed more invention with Scott Lawson and Mark Wilson lively in the forwards and Juan Pablo Socino orchestrating matters from fly-half and giving three-quarters Adam Powell and Sinoti Sinoti space to illustrate their attacking flair.

Powell, Wilson and Ruki Tipuna were the visitors' try-scorers with Socino kicking two penalties and Rory Clegg a conversion. A penalty from Olly Barkley was Welsh's sole response as they slipped eight points behind the Falcons.

Following last week's heavy defeat at Harlequins, London Welsh made five changes to their starting line-up.

Recent loan signing Chris Hala'ufia was introduced at No 8, while Pablo Henn, Nathan Morris, Richard Thorpe and Matt Corker were all recalled as Welsh sought their first win of the season.

Newcastle were unchanged after they picked up their first Premiership win of the season against Exeter last Sunday and they were ahead after only two minutes when Socino fired over an excellent penalty from the touchline.

Welsh soon responded with a penalty from Barkley but the visitors had much the better of the opening 15 minutes and deservedly scored the opening try of the game.

Socino's pass to Dom Barrow breached the home defence, before Barrow fed Mark Wilson, who in turn sent Powell in for the try, with Socino missing the simple conversion.

Welsh were dealt a further blow when prop, Taione Vea, limped off to be replaced by Jack Gilding before they nearly conceded another try.

A Welsh movement broke down on half-way allowing Socino to punt long into the home in-goal area. There was a race for the touchdown which was narrowly won by Welsh hooker, Morris, whose fingertips deprived visitors wing, Sinoti, of the score.

Elementary errors were preventing Welsh from building up any momentum and after 28 minutes they fell further behind when Socino kicked his second penalty.

Halau'fia then produced a shuddering tackle on Falcons' prop, Scott Wilson which caused referee, Wayne Barnes, to view the replay of the incident several times. Eventually he awarded a penalty to the visitors but Socino's routine penalty attempt rebounded back off a post.

Newcastle lost their impressive centre, Gonzalo Tiesi, to injury and he was replaced by Clegg but it did not impede their progress as they scored their second try with the final play of the first half.

Powell and Sinoti combined well to gain their side a platform in the opposition 22 before Mark Wilson crashed over for the try to give the Falcons a 16-3 half-time lead.

The first ten minutes of the second half saw Welsh have their best period of the match. Inspired by Hala'ufia they battered the Falcons' line but could not break down their stubborn defence and Newcastle immediately made them pay by breaking away to score the decisive try.

Sinotti and Wilson again combined to give Tipuna an easy run-in for the try which Clegg converted.

Newcastle made a raft of substitutions, which allowed the home side to dominate the final quarter.

With 11 minutes to go, Wilson was yellow carded as the Falcons struggled to stem the tide but even against 14 men, Welsh still could not make a breakthrough.
