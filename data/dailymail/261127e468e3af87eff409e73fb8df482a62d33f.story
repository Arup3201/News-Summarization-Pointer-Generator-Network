England's chosen ones are off to Portugal for a training camp ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, and are all smiles on the plane before the biggest tournament of their lives.

Sitting on specially-designed Three Lions seats, Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge posted a picture on his Twitter page with Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

England were given a thunderous send-off by the Kaiser Chiefs at their charity ball on Sunday night.

The Lions and Roses dinner, which was held at the Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire, marked the starting point for the country’s World Cup preparations.

Wayne Rooney is already out in Portugal, and took two fitness coaches with him on holiday to the Algarve and showed he meant business in a 90-second video uploaded on his official Facebook page.
