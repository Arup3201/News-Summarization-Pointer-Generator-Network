The man in charge of curing cricket of corruption is adamant that he made the right decision in allowing convicted spot-fixer Mohammad Aamer to return to the game seven months ahead of the end of his five-year ban.

Sir Ronnie Flanagan, chairman of the International Cricket Council’s anti-corruption unit, insists that his controversial decision that opens up the possibility of Aamer returning at the highest level against England in October will not set a dangerous precedent for other offenders.

Speaking ahead of the World Cup, the former chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary took full responsibility for throwing the gifted but flawed Aamer a lifeline but said he understands those who say he has been too lenient.

‘I fully respect the views of those who say that this shouldn't have happened but personally I’m content that it was right,’ said Flanagan here in Sydney.

‘He’s returned to a level of domestic cricket with no input in the international sphere whatsoever seven months early. I’m satisfied that the right thing was done.

‘We in anti-corruption in cricket say resolutely that we have zero tolerance and some people have said ‘well, how can this come about then?’ I believe you can have zero tolerance but it doesn’t mean the same punishment should apply to each incident. It’s my discretion and I stand by it and take responsibility for it.’

Aamer was one of the best young fast bowlers in the world when he was jailed along with his captain Salman Butt and experienced colleague Mohammad Asif after being caught by a News of the World sting bowling no balls in the Lord’s Test against England on demand for money.

He received more sympathy than his team-mates because it was widely felt he was manipulated by those in authority who should have known better but he was still banned for five years from having any involvement in the game.

Now Aamer, still only 22, has been cleared to play in Pakistani domestic cricket and has kept himself in good enough shape to have a realistic chance of being ready to play when England tour the United Arab Emirates later this year.

‘It was after a very rigorous examination of the entire case and a thorough consideration of his personal input and reaction that this decision was made,’ said Flanagan.

‘Did he plead guilty? Was he truly remorseful for what he’d done? The timing of that is important too. The process I went through and the decision I arrived at does not set any improper precedent for others.

‘I looked into it very carefully and have interviewed Aamer several times and I’m satisfied he met all the conditions. He has fully admitted his part in what happened, told us all he knows and was very co-operative with us.’

A crucial factor in Aamer’s partial amnesty was his willingness to take part in the ICC’s education programme trying to stop others making the mistakes that cost him his freedom and a large chunk of a highly promising career.

‘It’s all very well being told not to do something by an ex-cop but I think it’s something else all together to hear it from someone who was an international cricketer and fell from grace,’ said Flanagan. 

‘He is saying to them ‘please don’t do what I did. Please don’t succumb.’ I think that’s a powerful message.

‘What has happened is that he can now engage in domestic cricket under the auspices of the PCB in Pakistan. I’m very comfortable that that’s the right thing to do. He has made videos on our behalf that we have shown players highlighting exactly how he fell from grace and what happened to him.

‘He described how, when he won his first cap, he slept all night in his shirt that showed he was representing his country and what it meant for him and his family to fall from grace. Whether he’ll return to the international game depends on his ability and the PCB. 

'If he should do and he continues to be that person who delivers that message to others that they shouldn’t put themselves in the position he put himself in then that is a very strong message.’

The distinguished senior policeman accepts that the battle against corruption in cricket is an ongoing one and had strong words for those who will attempt to manipulate and abuse the World Cup which starts next week.

‘We know that there are rotten people out there, criminal people who will do all in their power to get at players and others of influence within the game,’ said Flanagan. 

‘They’ll trick them, coerce them and are almost like paedophiles in how they attempt to groom people into ultimately doing what suits their nefarious intentions.

‘We have gone to great lengths to ensure that they don’t get their way and I’m certain the players, officials and support staff will be working very carefully in support of what we are trying to do and we will be working in partnership to ensure that they never get their way.

‘I would like to assure the paying public that they will be coming to a tournament where all of those involved have done all in their power to ensure it is free from corruption or the threat of corruption.’
