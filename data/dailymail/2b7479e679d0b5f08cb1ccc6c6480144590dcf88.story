This is the moment rescuers raced against the clock to save a bull from mud on a flooded riverbank to stop it from being swept away by a rising tide.

It took more than four hours to drag the frightened bull to safety after it became trapped on the banks of the River Lune in Overton, Lancaster, Lancashire.

The terrified animal was spotted by neighbours and had sunk deep into the thick mud, unable to move anything but its head.

Rescue: Morecambe RNLI crew members battle against the incoming tide to rescue the bull

Colin Midwinter, Morecambe RNLI hovercraft crew member, said: 'This operation was an excellent example in demonstrating how the combined resources and expertise of the various rescue organisations can achieve successful outcomes under challenging circumstances.'

Fire crews, the RNLI, a coastguard team and other rescuers battled against the incoming tide as they finally dragged the bull free.

Two sets of firefighters attended and a request was sent for Morecambe RNLIâ€™s hovercraft to attend to give safety cover along with Bay Search and Rescue.

Bay Search and Rescue brought in its specialist tracked Hagglund vehicle to take firefighters and equipment to where the bull was stuck.

The hovercraft crew began working to free the animal using their own mud rescue equipment and lifting equipment on the Bay Search and Rescue vehicle was used to finally haul the beast free with just minutes to spare.

A Lancashire Fire and Rescue spokesman said: 'All three organisations worked as one for several hours, ever mindful of the impending high tide, utilising their specialist equipment, skills and teamwork, concluding the incident with the incoming tide lapping at their ankles and the safe extrication of the bull.'
