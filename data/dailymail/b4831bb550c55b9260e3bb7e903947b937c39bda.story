Jesse Kelly  has been arrested for allegedly breaching his parole for the crime which sent him to jail and sparked the violent Macquarie Fields riots in Sydney in 2005.

Kelly was arrested in Eschol Park by Macquarie Fields Police about 3pm Saturday.

While police officers completed a revocation of parole warrant, they say a small amount of the drug ice was found on Kelly in a search.

He was charged with drug possession and will face court next month, reported The Daily Telegraph.

Troubled: One of the people involved in a three-car crash outside Leumeah High School this morning is Jesse Kelly, the driver of the stolen car that crashed sparking some of Sydney's worst riots at Macquarie Field in 2005

On Thursday, Kelly was one of three people in a Ford Falcon involved in a three-vehicle smash in Sydney's southwest outside Leumeah High School,

Kelly's brother and cousin suffered facial, leg and hip injuries and two women were also hospitalised.

'I'm just a piece of s***, ay. Go away,' Jesse Kelly told waiting media outside Liverpool Hospital.

Kelly, whose driving license is suspended, denied he was behind the wheel of the Ford Falcon that crashed into two vehicles outside the school at around 8.30 am and refutes witness claims.

Police say he was one of three men in the car.

Mr Kelly suffered cuts to his legs in the crash and his brother and cousin, who were also in the Ford, remained in hospital on Thursday night in a stable condition.

Crumpled: Two of the cars outside Leumeah High School, south-west Sydney, on Thursday

Dramatic: Two women and three men were injured in the smash which happened around 8.30am just as children were being dropped at school

Investigating: Police are looking into the incident as two men remain in hospital on Thursday night

Asked as he left hospital what happened, Mr Kelly bluntly said 'there was a car accident '.

A witness to Thursday's crash outside Leumeah High School told The Daily Telegraph she was dropping her son at school when she was injured in the three-car smash.

Joanne Madden said: 'We were just driving off and a car was coming down and he came onto the wrong side of the road.'

Mr Kelly, his brother and cousin are now under police guard at hospital.

It is understood police are also searching for another youth who fled Liverpool Hospital.

Unrest: Police made numerous arrests in Macquarie Fields in Sydney's south-west in 2005 during ongoing unrest sparked by the death of two local teenagers in a stolen car driven by Mr Kelly

Frightening: They were some of the worst riots in Sydney's history

Kelly was only released from jail on bail last year, after pleading guilty to dangerous driving causing the deaths of his two passengers.

In February 2005, heÂ  was driving a stolen Holden Commodore when it smashed into a tree in Macquarie Fields just seconds into a high-speed police pursuit.

The crash killed Matthew Robertson, 19, and a 17-year-old Dylan Raywood.

After the crash, Kelly fled the scene and went on to hide in bush for 12 nights, while four nights of riots between police and residents exploded.

Kelly was given a maximum seven year and nine month sentence with a non-parole period of five and a half years.
