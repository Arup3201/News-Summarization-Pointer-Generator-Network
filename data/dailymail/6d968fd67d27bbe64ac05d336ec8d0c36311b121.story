Bank bosses have been 'creaming it' at the expense of their shareholders over the last decade, the chairman of troubled Royal Bank of Scotland admitted yesterday.

Sir Philip Hampton conceded that pay had been too high for too long, particularly in the investment banking sector.

In an unusually frank admission he acknowledged that top bankers had 'creamed it' by hauling in high pay, while shareholders had received 'diddly squat' for ten years.

RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton (left) said bankers' pay is too high - after signing off a bonus worth almost a million pounds for bank boss Stephen Hester (right)

However, he claimed the issues were 
being 'corrected'. He also insisted the £1.2million salary of his chief 
executive Stephen Hester was 'quite low' compared with other top 
bankers.

Earlier this week Mr Hester, who took 
over as chief executive after the Government bailed out RBS in 2008, 
agreed to waive a bonus worth almost £1million.

Sir Philip said the bank had 
'underestimated the scale of the public reaction' to the payouts. 
However, he pointed out that Mr Hester held 'one of the most challenging
and demanding jobs in world business'.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said banking
had to change, and insisted the party's attacks on bonuses were not 
motivated by the 'politics of envy'.

Mr Hester, who took over as chief executive after the Government bailed out the near-bankrupt RBS in 2008, was doing a ‘great job’ in turning the bank around and protecting the taxpayer’s 83 per cent investment in the business, he said.

Sir Philip, who himself turned down a £1.4million bonus earlier this month, confirmed that he had signed off Mr Hester’s proposed package of £963,000 worth of RBS shares - which was 60 per cent of the maximum he could have received under a performance-related scheme.

Ed Miliband warned bankers yesterday they must wave goodbye to their culture of 'excessive' bonuses and reconnect with the rest of the country.

In a speech in London's Canary Wharf financial district, the Labour leader (pictured) urged a return to 'one nation banking' which would serve the wider economy and society.

Mr Miliband told the bankers in his audience at the Thomson Reuters Building that they needed to reflect 'the values of Britain'.

'We cannot have a banking sector so divorced from the rest of the economy and the rest of society,' he said.

'We succeed or fail together. It is not about the politics of envy, it is about a culture of responsibility.

'We need what you might call "one nation banking". We need banks that serve the real economy. We need banking serving every region, every sector, every business, every family in this country.

'And we need banks run in a way that people believe are consistent with their values - the values of Britain.'

He added: 'Responsibility means ending the culture of excessive bonuses.'

The Labour leader warned of a return to 'two nations', the description of 19th century Britain used by Victorian Conservative prime minister Benjamin Disraeli.

The banking and financial sector was on a path of 'gradual separation from the rest of society', he said.

Mr Miliband said banks, effectively underwritten by the taxpayer, could not be 'immune' from public debate.

'This is a call on banking to recognise that it should take the path of change, to recognise that it is not isolated from the economy or society,' he said.

In a question and answer session following his speech, Mr Miliband said the public sector must set 'the best example' when it comes to high pay, as he pressed ministers to reveal who signed off the tax arrangements of Student Loans Company boss Ed Lester.

Earlier in the week, it was revealed Mr Lester was paid through a separate company, which enabled him to avoid paying thousands of pounds in tax. Mr Miliband also criticised six-figure bonuses at Network Rail.

He said: 'If politicians are going to be concerned about what are seen as excessive bonuses in the banking sector, I think we should be equally concerned with organisations like Network Rail."

He added: 'I think there are really unanswered questions here about what was going on at the Student Loans Company. And there continues to be a question of whether income tax and National Insurance is going to be paid.

'All us have to understand that times are different and it is particularly important that the public sector sets the best example it can. These aren't just issues for the banking sector, these are issues which are broader as well.'

But he denied that he had been swayed
by Government pressure to keep the bonus under £1 million and said that
it was Hester himself who decided to give up the payout in order to 
protect his own reputation and that of the bank.

'The decision in relation to Stephen 
Hester’s bonus was made by the remuneration committee and recommended to
the board,' he said.

'We
took account of shareholders’ contributions, but we never had the sense
that there was an arbitrary minimum or maximum. We made an evaluation 
of his performance.'

Sir Philip acknowledged that RBS got 
its presentation wrong: 'I think it is true that we under-estimated the 
scale of the public reaction to the bonus award.

'I
think probably, in hindsight, having Stephen Hester as the focal point 
of public concern about these things, being the first to be scrutinised 
in this way, was wrong.

'We
did that essentially because there was so much speculation, we thought 
the speculation itself was damaging and decided to try to end the 
speculation by making it plain.'

Despite widespread speculation, the RBS board never threatened to resign over the bonus issue, said Sir Philip.

Asked whether he now expected Mr Hester to walk away from his job, he acknowledged that intense scrutiny of his bonus had been 'challenging' for the chief executive, but described him as 'a tough character' who was 'dedicated to turning the business round'.

Sir Philip told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I think if this bank is fully returned to profitability by an able management team, that is very much in the interests of the British taxpayer. Stephen Hester and his team are, I think, doing a great job.

'I recognise absolutely that some of the pay levels are very high, very difficult for people to understand, but by the standards of this market they are not high.'

Sir Philip acknowledged public unease about the scale of rewards across the financial sector.

'Pay has been high for too long, particularly in the banks, particularly in the investment banks,' he said. 'Shareholders have done pretty badly and employees have done pretty well over the last 10 years.

'That needs to be corrected. It isn’t a society or fairness issue, it is a straightforward business issue. Too much of the money is not going to the right place and the shareholder rewards have not been sufficient.

'I think that is in the process of changing now. It’s perhaps not changing as quickly as many would like, but it is changing, pay is falling in this industry and has been falling in recent years.

'At some stage, there will be a business correction to bring banker pay properly in line with underlying performance of the business.'

But he added that being unable to attract the best staff would damage the performance of the bank, which was worth £900million to the Treasury for every penny increase in its share price.

'I do think it is very important that it is recognised that Stephen Hester has one of the most challenging, demanding jobs - literally - in world business,' he said.

'This is a huge bank, absolutely vital to the British economy, systemically important to the world financial system.

'It got into a terrible mess. Stephen Hester and his team were brought in to sort that mess out.

'Although their pay is very high in absolute terms, in relative terms to other bankers and top businessmen generally, it is not particularly high. In fact by most measures, it is quite low.

'Whilst I understand this concern, I also know we have got to live in a competitive marketplace and if we don’t get this enormous financial institution run by the best people, then we won’t be doing the right job for the British taxpayer.'

Sir Philip described how Mr Hester came to the decision last weekend to give up his bonus.

'Stephen and I discussed the public reaction at some length and he concluded after that conversation that the reputational considerations both to himself and the bank meant that the best course now was to waive it,' he said.

Sir Philip declined to comment on the 
decision to strip former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin of his 
knighthood, telling Today: 'I think these things, from the point of view
of the bank, should be consigned to history.'
