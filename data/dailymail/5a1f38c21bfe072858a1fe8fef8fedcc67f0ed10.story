A woman plied underage boys with alcohol and allowed them to smoke cannabis in her home to groom them for sex, a court heard.

Chantelle Goatley  of Newbury, Berkshire, allegedly slept with one teenager and molested a second after permitting illegal drinking and drug sessions at her house.

The boys she invited into her home were 14 to 15 years of age at the time, it was said.

Jurors heard of messages exchanged on Facebook between her and one of the boys

The 36-year-old denies five charges relating to events between January and April last year.

Jurors heard of messages exchanged on Facebook between her and one of the boys.

In it she asked him if he regretted anything, and whether he could ‘remember it all’.

Two days later a message from her account to his informed him: 'You’ve got 18 bottles of Stella and loads of weed to have. xx.'

Minutes later she added: 'Vodka, weed, me. What more could you ask for?'

The second boy told police that on one occasion, after he drank and smoked so much as to lose all memory of events, he awoke to find Goatley next to him and she asked him: 'How was the b*** j**?'

When she started rubbing his thigh he got up and went downstairs. Prosecutor Matthew Walsh said: 'They were still children and she knew their ages.'

'The address she was living at became a popular place for these boys to spend their time, particularly at weekends.

'There was alcohol ready for them to drink, which she bought. There was cannabis there for them to smoke.

'This was, in effect, for those interested in drinking and smoking cannabis, a good place to spend the weekend.

'But there was more to it. This wasn’t just provision of alcohol and cannabis. There was a motive behind it: It was grooming, grooming these young boys... because when they were drunk, or to use the common expression "stoned", struggling to function normally, she would be in a position to take advantage.

'The prosecution case is that is what she did. She took advantage.'

Goatley’s Tesco clubcard showed a purchase of 18 bottles of Stella Artois lager and a four-pack of Smirnoff Ice alcopops on March 19 last year - the same day the message was sent to the boy about having '18 bottles of Stella'.

Mr Walsh said in addition to the alcohol, the cannabis was provided or 'money given to them to source it'.

When the first alleged victim was in such a state that he could barely stand, Goatley was said to have taken advantage of the situation to have sex with him at her home, Reading Crown Court heard

Once the boys’ inhibitions were down Goatley would use sexual language, telling them she would 'do it with them all night', the court heard.

When the first alleged victim was in such a state that he could barely stand, Goatley was said to have taken advantage of the situation to have sex with him at her home.

The following morning she was said to have performed a sex act on him.

Later that day, as she was in hospital awaiting an operation, he began receiving messages from her, which read: 'Do you regret anything???' and a smiley face, it was said.

When he said he did not think so, she asked: 'Can you remember it all? Be honest hun x.'

He responded with: 'Not after I was sick,' to which she returned: 'Oh' and a sad face.

As the conversation continued she was said to have written: 'I’m sorry. I thought you actually liked it/me. I was wrong. It was my fault,' before later adding: 'If it was a mistake just say.'

She then told him: 'Make sure you delete these messages please babe.'

Mr Walsh asked the jury: 'What is she talking about. What is the it/me she’s talking about there? Was what a mistake, and is he interested in what, you might wonder?'

It was two days later that she was back in touch, mentioning the 'Stella and weed'.

When she was first interviewed by police Goatley told them that no such sexual activity had taken place as the boys had described and that the 'it' in the Facebook conversation had related to smoking cannabis and not sex.

Yet when she was interviewed a second time, Goatley changed her account, the jury heard, and said her memory of the messages and of everything she had told police in the first interview had been affected by prescription painkillers given to her by the doctor at the police station.

She said she had not sent the messages to the boy.

'She said she didn’t remember having those exchanges and because it wasn’t her that had been sending those messages it must have been someone else, unless the boy had been going into his Facebook account and sending himself those messages,' said Mr Walsh.

Goatley denies one charge of permitting her premises to be used for smoking cannabis, one of committing an offence with the intention of committing a sexual offence, one of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and two of engaging in sexual activity with a child.

The trial, before Judge Johannah Cutts QC, at Reading Crown Court, continues.
