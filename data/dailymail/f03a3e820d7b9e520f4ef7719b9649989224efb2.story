A growing rift between Ed Miliband and his Election chief has sparked new fears that the Labour campaign is in crisis.

Labour insiders say relations between Mr Miliband and chief strategist Douglas Alexander are so bad, they are barely on speaking terms.

Miliband's allies have accused Mr Alexander of 'sulking' after Miliband put Lucy Powell in charge of day-to-day campaigning in the Election. Alexander's friends have hit back, claiming he is 'frustrated' by Miliband's 'inability to act decisively'.

With just over five months to go before the General Election on May 7, Shadow Cabinet Ministers fear the fallout could rob them of victory.

A well-placed source said: 'The tension is palpable when Miliband and Alexander are together. Alexander talks down to Ed and Ed bristles at it.

'Alexander doesn't think Ed pays enough attention to his ideas. It is madness when the polls suggest that the next Election will be such a close- run thing.'

The source added: 'They need to put egos and past squabbles to one side and work together for the sake of the party.'

When Miliband gave the Election post to Alexander it was seen as a way of healing the rift caused by Alexander's role in running David Miliband's failed bid to beat his brother to the Labour leadership in 2010.

But party sources say that, if anything, relations between the two men are even worse now. 

Although Alexander and Ed Miliband worked closely together for Gordon Brown, Alexander is seen as a 'Blairite' compared to Left-winger Miliband.

Alexander, Mr Brown's former speech writer, held several Cabinet positions in the Blair and Brown governments. 

More recently, he came under fire for Labour's lacklustre campaign during the Scottish referendum – which was rescued by Brown's 11th-hour intervention.

Alexander's General Election plan has also been challenged by Labour MPs. Some say his '35 per cent' strategy, whereby Labour sets out to win its 'core vote' but does not woo Middle England, is 'too defensive.' Similarly, his claim that Labour has little to fear from Ukip has been challenged by new evidence that Nigel Farage is eating into the party's support.

Miliband's decision last month to put Ms Powell in charge of day-to-day campaigning, with Alexander still in overall control, was seen as an attempt to sideline Alexander. But Powell herself has been accused of 'naïve' gaffes, including advising Labour MPs not to discuss immigration on the doorstep with voters.

It is not the first time Alexander has been involved in rows with senior Labour figures.

The Mail on Sunday revealed in January how he and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had to be 'dragged apart' when they almost came to blows during a blazing row.

Former Cabinet Minister Tessa Jowell was forced to intervene, saying she feared the pair were about to get into 'fisticuffs' when they clashed in a private Commons room.

In March, this newspaper revealed how another of Miliband's Election aides, Michael Dugher, told the Labour leader he wanted to resign, saying he could no longer work with 'bloody impossible' Alexander.

Mr Dugher was moved to the transport portfolio, avoiding further clashes with Alexander.

And in April, Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman and Mr Balls were caught plotting against Alexander outside Balls's Commons office.

Ms Harman told Balls: 'The trouble with Douglas is that he just isn't engaged at the moment.' The Shadow Chancellor reportedly nodded in reply.
