For Dave King, the battle for control of Rangers is all but over. The resignation of Ibrox chairman David Somers on Monday morning brought confirmation that the end of days has arrived for this reviled current plc board.

Yet, the hard work starts here as King and his backers try to revive an institution that has been more akin to a circus than a football club in the chaotic last three years since administration, then liquidation, visited Govan.

Here, Sportsmail looks at the tasks that will be taking priority in King’s packed in-tray as he embarks on a rebuilding job that he and his team believe could take up to five years.

Dave King is set to take control of Rangers after chairman Dave Somers resigned from post on Monday

1. Appoint a new executive team

With the repayment of Mike Ashley’s £5million loan, and running costs of upwards of £25m over the next two years, Rangers need a top-class executive team in place as quickly as possible to map out the club’s financial future.

After Friday’s extraordinary general meeting, King will install his allies Paul Murray and John Gilligan as directors.

The two remaining current plc directors, Derek Llambias, Rangers’ chief executive, and Barry Leach, director of finance, are not expected to tender their resignations.

But King’s first move is expected to be to sack and replace them — whatever the cost. Not surprisingly to those following this rapacious Rangers saga, Llambias and Leach have both just been awarded bumper contracts, complete with lengthy notice periods.

2. Appoint a manager

Kenny McDowall tendered his resignation in January and the uncomfortable-looking 51-year-old keeps making it plain he does not want to be the manager of Rangers a minute longer than he absolutely has to. Under his management, performances have been poor with Rangers winning just two of their last six games.

But it would take a collapse of monumental proportions for the Ibrox side to be overtaken by Falkirk and Queen of the South for a place in the play-offs.

Stuart McCall is being viewed as the favourite for the post, while fans would love to see King bring back Walter Smith, even in a short-term capacity.

But whoever the new manager is, the speedier the appointment, the more time he would have to set his players up for a push at promotion.

What is unarguable is this: the new man needs to coax better performances than managed by Ally McCoist and McDowall if Rangers are to overcome a Hibs side that has swatted them aside with ease in the Championship this season.

3. Player recruitment

There are 12 Rangers first-team players out of contract in the summer. Captain Lee McCulloch, plus Kris Boyd, Kenny Miller, Jon Daly, Bilel Mohsni, Darren McGregor, Richard Foster, Steven Smith, Sebastien Faure, Ian Black, Kyle Hutton and Steve Simonsen all see their deals run out on June 1, 2015.

The sheer volume of out-of-contract players makes it easy for the new boss to carry out a mass cull of what was described by Ibrox legend Richard Gough as ‘probably the worst ever’ team in Rangers history.

Yet from such a late starting point, the clock is ticking for the new regime to make wholesale changes. And with out-of-contract players free to speak to suitors since January 1, Rangers are already behind the eight ball in recruiting Bosman signings.

4. Mike Ashley and onerous contracts

Mike Ashley's crisis loans kept the Ibrox club afloat in recent times in exchange for security over pretty much everything bar Ibrox, not to mention an increasingly large share of retail revenues.

The contracts with Ashley’s Sports Direct are currently the biggest drain on income at Ibrox. Analysis by the Union of Fans suggests that for every £10 spent on merchandise, Rangers receive an eye-wateringly poor 75p.

The suggestions are that these onerous deals are watertight but King’s team need to find out if there is room for manoeuvre. They will also need to go through everything they find with a fine-tooth comb to ensure Ashley is not leaving behind any nasty surprises.

5. SFA fit and proper tests

Having won the war to take control at Ibrox, King now needs to convince the SFA he is a fit and proper person to become a director of Rangers.

A member of the club board under Craig Whyte that eventually saw Rangers liquidated in 2012, tax offences in South Africa saw King fork out £44m in settlement in 2013.

That raises issues because the SFA’s professional game board look at whether a proposed director has been convicted within the last 10 years of ‘(i) an offence liable to imprisonment of two years or over, (ii) corruption or (iii) fraud’.

The Hampden board also considers whether the applicant has been a director at a club within the five years preceding an insolvency event.

King’s prolonged struggle with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) has been raised repeatedly by the current plc board.

But SARS has imposed no restriction on King acting as a company director and he remains ‘confident’ of passing the SFA’s fit-and-proper-person tests.

Paul Murray, who was sacked from the Ibrox board by Whyte, must also convince the SFA he is a fit and proper person to be a director.

6. Infrastructure

Rangers fans regularly complain about the decrepit state of Ibrox.

Cash is needed to bring it back up to acceptable standard, especially with fans likely to return through the gates in numbers to support the popular new regime.

The club’s Murray Park training base at Auchenhowie, which opened 14 years ago, is also badly in need of renovation.

Furthermore, Rangers will have to fork out to appoint a team of talent spotters given that the club’s scouting network was scrapped when Neil Murray left in April 2013.

Former boss McCoist previously described the need for a scouting system at Rangers as: ‘My No 1 priority for the club moving ahead.’
