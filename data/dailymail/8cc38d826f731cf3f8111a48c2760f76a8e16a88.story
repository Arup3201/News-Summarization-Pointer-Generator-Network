The League Cup semi-final draw was met with roars of delight from both the Celtic and Rangers squads after the first Old Firm derby in three seasons was confirmed.

Celtic striker Anthony Stokes admitted his team-mates had made their feelings clear when news filtered through to their dressing room after the 1-0 Premiership win over Inverness at Parkhead.

The cries of celebration were audible from outside as the numbers of Dundee United and Aberdeen appeared first out of the hat.

There was an identical reaction to the last-four match-up from the Rangers players in the aftermath of their 1-0 victory at Dumbarton in the Scottish Cup.

Stokes’ joy at landing an ‘epic’ League Cup semi-final was clear.

The Glasgow rivals will now meet at Hampden in three months’ time, with the game scheduled for either Saturday January 31 or Sunday February 1 — the latter date looking more likely.

The news overshadowed John Guidetti’s latest winning goal for Celtic and the build-up will begin now for a fixture not played since April 2012. ‘We just watched it downstairs and there were a few cheers,’ said Stokes of the draw.

‘Being realistic, it was the draw everyone wanted — fans, ourselves. It will be a tough game. I think everyone misses the rivalry.

‘I think it will be different to any other Old Firm game because we have gone so long without it.’

Stokes’ excitement at the return of the old fixture was matched by his manager Ronny Deila, who has never experienced an Old Firm match before.

With Rangers operating a division below in the Championship, the Norwegian admits his team will go into the tie bearing the weight of expectation.

‘Right now, we are favourites,’ said Deila. ‘We have that in every game in Scotland and we will be favourites against Rangers, unless something special happens in January.’

Deila’s counterpart Ally McCoist agreed with that assessment, adding: ‘I’m delighted with the draw and, judging by the reaction from the boys in the dressing room, they are happier than me.’
