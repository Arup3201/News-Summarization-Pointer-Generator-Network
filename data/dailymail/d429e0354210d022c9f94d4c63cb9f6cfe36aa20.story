A baby boy has made a miraculous recovery after being born with a giant cyst so large that it looked like he had two heads.

Harry Barron-Edgley was born perfectly healthy apart from the 13cm cyst on the side of his neck.

The growth was so large that his concerned mother, Ellie Wellman-Smith, 20, initially believed her baby had been born with two heads.

Harry Barron-Edgley has made an amazing recovery after being born with a 13cm cyst on his neck. The growth was so big that his mother, Ellie Wellman-Smith, initially thought he had two heads

But thankfully, after five operations, doctors have finally been able to remove the growth which was causing Harry to suffer from back and neck problems.

The 15-week-old is now back at home in Corby, Northamptonshire, with his family.

‘As soon as I'd given birth to Harry I closed my eyes in relief, I was so pleased I'd got him out,’ said Ms Wellman-Smith.

‘But when I opened my eyes as they handed me to him I was so shocked - I thought he'd been born with two heads.

‘I had no idea what it was - whether it was cancer or a tumour or something he'd have forever, it was really scary.

‘I was so overwhelmed with love for him, I wasn't worried about how it looked, I just wanted my baby to be OK.

‘I just feel so lucky that the doctors were able to remove it. Harry's neck looks amazing now - you'd never have known what was there before.’

Doctors were initially concerned that Harry's growth may be something sinister, but Ms Wellman-Smith was relieved when she was told that the cyst was purely cosmetic.

Harry had been born with a lymphatic malformation - a collection of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, that result from a malformation in the lymphatic system - the system meant to drain fluid from tissues.

The sacks, which can leak causing growths to increase in size, occur when the lymph vessels fail to form correctly during the first few weeks of pregnancy.

Ms Wellman-Smith said: 'I was so overwhelmed with love for him, I wasn't worried about how it looked, I just wanted my baby to be OK'

‘As soon as the midwives saw Harry's lump they pressed a buzzer and within about 30 seconds 20 doctors were in the room,’ said Ms Wellman-Smith.

‘They were checking around the growth and putting things down his throat to see if he was breathing.

‘Then he was whisked to the special care baby unit and there was about an hour and a half when I didn't even know if he was alive.

‘He had an ultrasound scan the next morning and I was relieved when the doctors eventually told us that Harry had a lymphatic malformation and that it was just a cosmetic problem.

‘We were discharged from hospital and given an outpatient appointment three weeks later to discuss his treatment.

‘We're really lucky because if they'd have used forceps or given me a C-section they could have cut into the growth and Harry could have bled to death.’

At the outpatient's appointment, Ms Wellman-Smith was told that her son could be given an injection therapy to decrease the size of the cyst.

Disappointed with the news that it would not be removed completely, Ms Wellman-Smith received a second opinion from Mr Kuo, a consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Ms Wellman-Smith said: ‘After our first appointment I was told that the cyst would never fully go away and I was just really worried that Harry would get bullied because it was so large.

‘I felt like his future looked very bleak and that Harry's life was going to be horrible.

‘The growth was starting to bend his back and I was just so concerned.

‘But when I got in touch with Mr Kuo he was amazing. He brought Harry in for a scan and then gave us the fantastic news that the cyst could be removed.’

On the first of July Harry underwent his first surgery.

‘When Harry went for his operation it was the worst day of my life,’ said Ms Wellman-Smith.

‘Watching the doctors put him to sleep was horrible - I just felt him slipping away, I was a mess.

‘He was in surgery for five hours and then I went up to see him in ICU.

Harry had an operation to remove the cyst but it kept swelling up so he had to return to surgery four times to have it drained. He has now been able to go home

‘It was really weird at first to see him without the cyst. The cyst was part of my baby and that's how I'd carried him.

‘It was strange but it was amazing too.’

Whilst the initial surgery was a success, Harry has since had to go through four more procedures.

‘The cyst keep swelling up so he's had to go in a few more times to get it drained,’ said Ms Wellman-Smith.

‘We're back at home now though and I just couldn't be happier.

‘Everyone at Birmingham Children's hospital has been great - especially Mr Kuo.

‘Harry can finally start living his life.’

Mr Kuo, consultant ear nose and throat surgeon at Birmingham Children's Hospital, said: ‘This is a very uncommon condition and can happen anywhere in the body.

‘They vary from being very small to very large, and can either be made up of lots of small cysts or lots of large ones.

Harry's cyst was removed by Mr Kuo at Birmingham Children's Hospital on July 1

‘How you treat them varies from child to child. I always see the children together with specialist children's radiologist, Dr Simon McGuirk, so that we can discuss with the parents what the relative advantages of surgery and injection treatment are.

‘In Harry's case, the cyst was very large but it didn't obstruct the airway so he was lucky.

‘We were able to operate and I'm pleased with Harry's results. It's important when you operate to avoid the nerves that affect things like smiling and facial expressions.

‘We always leave a little bit of extra skin to allow for contraction but eventually you'll hardly see anything at all.

‘Harry has done extremely well.’
