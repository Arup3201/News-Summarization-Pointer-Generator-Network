Ahead of Argentina's World Cup 
semi-final clash with Louis van Gaal's Holland in Sao Paulo, Sportsmail 
takes a closer look at Alejandro Sabella's side.

Player of the tournament: Lionel Messi (5 games, 4 goals)

With the exception of Brazil and Neymar, no side in the competition has relied so heavily on their star player.

Four of Argentina’s five games have needed a sprinkle of Messi magic to drag Alejandro Sabella’s side back from the abyss. Without the four-time Ballon d’Or winner they probably wouldn’t have made it out of their group.

Tournament highlight: Angel di Maria's goal vs Switzerland

Argentina made it far more difficult to beat Switzerland than it should have been, after failing to convert one of their 28 chances in the 117 minutes prior to Angel Di Maria’s well-taken match-winner.

Messi, unsurprisingly, was the architect. His wonderful assist, that saw him drive at the heart of Switerland’s defence from a central position before laying the ball off to Di Maria, conjured up memories of Diego Maradona setting up Claudio Caniggia against Brazil in 1990.

Unstoppable: Angel di Maria's extra-time winner against Switzerland owed much to Messi's build-up play

Lowlight: Their over-reliance on Messi

‘Every time we recover the ball, we try to pass to him as he's the best player we have,’ said Pablo Zabaleta after their last-16 win against Switzerland. This dependence has been far too evident at times.

Despite boasting some outstanding talents in attack, the likes of Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Ezequiel Lavezzi have failed to reproduce their club form in Brazil, putting more pressure on Messi to make the difference. Fortunately for them the Barcelona man has duly obliged.

Best goal: Messi v Iran, 1-0 group stage, Estadio Mineirao, Belo Horizonte

The two-time World Cup winners were on the brink of an embarrassing draw with Iran that would have both seriously dented their confidence and put their place in the knockout stages in doubt, when up stepped Messi. Picking the ball up 30 yards from goal in the 91st minute, he drifted in from the right and curled an unstoppable left-foot strike into the far corner to make it two wins from two.

How has the boss performed?

Argentina
 are in the last four because of Messi, not Alejandro Sabella.

Throughout the tournament there have been rumours circulating that 
Sabella has little respect from the players within the Argentina camp, 
particularly following a bust-up with Messi at half-time in their 
opening match against Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Reports in Argentina and Spain
 suggest their captain ‘ordered’ Sabella to switch from a 5-3-2 to a 
4-3-3 and bring on Fernando Gago and Gonzalo Higuain for the second 
half. Argentina have played 4-3-3 in every match since.

In control? Rumours have circulated that Alejandro Sabella does not have the respect of some Argentina players

Top scorer: Lionel Messi (4 goals)

Killer stat: The four strikers that Sabella chose to support Messi in Brazil scored 83 goals between them at top clubs in Europe last season. Sergio Aguero, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Gonzalo Higuain and Rodrigo Palacios have one between them at this World Cup.
