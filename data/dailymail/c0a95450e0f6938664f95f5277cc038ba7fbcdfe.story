Is this the world’s most politically correct snack?

A Melbourne café has caused an internet sensation with their innovation, the ‘organic, vegan genderless gingerbread figure’ - their ultra-modern take on the traditional gingerbread man.

The Organic Food & Wine Deli in Melbourne’s CBD have made gingerbread men palatable for the socially adware, allergy-ridden and health conscious.

It’s understood the ginger people were named playfully by the deli owners, but the debate has surged on Social Media, with people worldwide who have taken the issue to heart speaking out. 

The Reddit post, which has ignited worldwide debate about the politically correct way to refer to baked goods

A photo of the deli’s biscuit was originally posted on Reddit before it quickly went viral.

Many were thrilled to see their concerns about the sexist term ‘gingerbread men’ had finally been addressed.

However, many took to Social Media – outraged that their own minority group had been discriminated against by the choice of wording.

‘So offensive to gingers’, wrote one person.

‘They should be called strawberry blondes,’ argued a Twitter user.

‘So offensive to amputees,’ added another.

‘Why they gotta be so white?’ 

Others were concerned by the nutritional content of the organic, vegan biscuits.

‘And it’s not even gluten-free!’ exclaimed a troubled individual.

‘Are they fair trade?’

On the store’s website, they explain The Organic Food & Wine Deli store owners explain that they are committed to using only organic and ethical products. 

Their store uses ‘biopaint’ on its walls with shelves made from low emission plantation timber.

Sugar cane fibre packaging which breaks down in 6 weeks is used for takeaway containers and their shopping bags are made from non sweat shop, non child labour villages.

They only use coffee which is fair trade and is part of the rainforest alliance.

A Reddit user joked that the new name would cause serious issues for beloved nursery rhymes.
