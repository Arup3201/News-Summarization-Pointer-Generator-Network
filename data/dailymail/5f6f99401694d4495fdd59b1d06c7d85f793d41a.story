Two men have been charged in the United States with conspiring to help overthrow the government in the tiny West African nation of Gambia, federal prosecutors said Monday.

Both men were in custody and were expected to make court appearances Monday in Baltimore and Minneapolis.

The charges stem from a Dec. 30 coup attempt in the former British colony, which came as the longtime ruler was away. 

Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, who has since returned to the country, blamed 'terrorist groups' for the coup attempt and alleged that plotters had received backing from foreign countries.

Prosecutors say the two men, Cherno Njie and Papa Faal, traveled separately from the United States to Gambia to participate in the unrest there. They later returned to the U.S. and are now in custody.

'The United States strongly condemns such conspiracies. With these serious charges, the United States is committed to holding them fully responsible for their actions,' Attorney General Eric Holder said in the statement. 

Overall, about 10 to 12 people were in Gambia to try to overthrow the government 'with the expectation that others in the country would join and assist them,' the department said. 

According to BBC News, court documents indicate Njie was a leader of the conspiracy who was set to be appointed interim leader of Gambia had the coup succeeded.

Human rights activists have long criticized the Gambian government for targeting political opponents, journalists and gays and lesbians.

Faal, 46, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Gambia who lives in Minnesota, told investigators that in August he joined a movement in the United States bent on overthrowing the government. 

He said he was motivated to be part of the group, which prosecutors said planned to ambush the president's convoy, by concerns that elections were being rigged and over 'the plight of the Gambian people,' according to court papers.

Prosecutors say he purchased semi-automatic rifles in Minnesota that were then shipped by cargo ship to Gambia.

After members of the group were defeated at the Gambian State House, Faal escaped by ferry to neighboring Senegal, where he walked into the U.S. Embassy, spoke to U.S. officials and gave the FBI permission to search his home in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, prosecutors say.

Njie, 57, is a U.S. citizen of Gambian descent who lives in Austin, Texas. He was arrested Sunday after flying into Dulles International Airport from Senegal.

It wasn't immediately clear whether the two men had lawyers.

Yahya Jammeh seized power in a 1994 coup

Gunmen attacked the capital, Banjul, in the early hours of December 30, when President Yahya Jammeh was out of the country.

Diplomats say at least four attackers were killed. On the run were several others. 

Since returning on Wednesday, Jammeh has warned he would not spare anyone involved in the attempted coup, which local media said was led by former presidential guard chief Lamin Sanneh.

Sanneh's mother and brother were amongst those arrested so far, family members said, asking not to be named.

'Nobody can also destabilize this country. So anybody who comes to attack this country; be ready because you are going to die no matter who you are and who backed you,' Jammeh said.

'We will get to the bottom of this and we will not spare anybody,' he said. 'Enough is enough. They want to destroy our country. We will destroy them,' he added.

Jammeh came to power in a coup 20 years ago and has a tight grip on the tiny nation, a slither of land on the Atlantic coast surrounded by Senegal.

A failed coup plot in 2006 led to a crackdown and some executions, according to rights groups.

Jammeh is one of Africa's most vocal anti-gay leaders and has previously threatened to behead sexual minorities found in his country. The U.S. government recently removed Gambia from a trade agreement in response to human rights abuses, including a law signed in October that imposes life imprisonment for some homosexual acts.

Jammeh also drew swift condemnation from activists in 2007 after he insisted that HIV-positive patients stop taking their antiretroviral medications, claiming he could cure them with an herbal body rub and bananas.

Soldiers loyal to Gambian President Yahya Jammeh went house-to-house in search of opponents Thursday after the longtime leader blamed 'terrorist groups' for staging a coup attempt earlier this week.

Jammeh, who was out of the country at the time of Tuesday's attack but has since returned to Banjul, the capital, alleged that the coup plotters had received backing from some foreign countries.

'I live for the Gambia and I will die fighting for the truth. No human being can do anything to me, my government or the Gambia,' Jammeh said. 'It was not a coup. It was an attack by dissidents based in the US, Germany and United Kingdom.'

After hours of fighting, forces loyal to Jammeh's regime succeeded in getting the upper hand, killing five insurgents. It was not immediately known how many casualties were suffered by the national military.

'We are all gripped by fear,' said one Banjul resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

Papa Faal said he was motivated to be part of the group, which prosecutors said planned to ambush the president's convoy, by concerns that elections were being rigged and over 'the plight of the Gambian people,' according to court papers.
