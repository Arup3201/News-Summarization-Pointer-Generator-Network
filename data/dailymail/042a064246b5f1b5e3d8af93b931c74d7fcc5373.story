China’s love-affair with the car has caused the country to suffer some of the world’s worst air quality.

But now an innovative car vending machine has been unveiled in Hangzhou, on the the south-eastern coast, that could help combat the problem.

With just the push of a button, commuters can drive away in an electric car operated by Kandi Technologies.

The tiny cars - manufactured by Volvo's owners Geely - reach a top speed of 75mph and can travel for around 50 miles per charge

In a similar way to how Boris bikes work in London, people in need of a ride can borrow a fully-charged, electric car from an automated garage.

Each of the specially designed parking lots can hold up to 300 vehicles, which can be rented on the spot by members of the car share service.

For less than £2 an hour commuters can rent one of the Chinese-made vehicles, using a membership card, which is then lowered down to them, fully-charged and ready to drive.

China’s love-affair with the car has caused the country to suffer some of the world’s worst air quality.

Around 80 million new cars expected on China’s roads by the end of the decade and these will join the 120 million already in use.

As a result, the government is limiting the number of new license plates it will issue.

China’s premier Li Keqiang recently said the government should use electric vehicles to combat pollution.

Once their journey is done, drivers just have to drop off their rented motor at the nearest station.

The tiny cars - manufactured by Volvo's owners Geely - reach a top speed of 75mph and can travel for around 50 miles per charge.

‘Kandi EV is beautiful, flexible, easy to operate, green and is a great choice for the vehicle sharing system,’ said Hong Li, director of Hangzhou's Tourism Commission.

‘Having EV sharing stations located across the city will provide more convenient transportation options for the citizens and tourists in Hangzhou.’

Since the launch last year, Kandi has opened two EV vending machines in Hangzhou, and also has plans to open another 10 this year, expanding into more populated cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.

The scheme could help combat China's smog problem, which is especially severe in winter

Kandi has outlined a five-year plan to establish a public transportation system across the city, including up to 100,000 rental cars, EV smart vertical parking and charging facilities.

They also have plans to open another 10 stations this year, expanding into China's more populated cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.

The scheme could help combat China’s on-going smog problem, which is especially severe in winter.

China’s premier Li Keqiang recently said the government should use electric vehicles to help improve pollution levels in the country’s major cities.

Earlier this month it was reported that the smog has become so thick in Beijing that the public have been flocking to huge outdoor TV screens to watch virtual sunrises.
