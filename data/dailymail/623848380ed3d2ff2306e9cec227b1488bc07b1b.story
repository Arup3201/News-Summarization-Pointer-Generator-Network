A baseball fan was last night left clutching his head in agony as he was struck by a flying bat.

Josh Hamilton’s bat slipped out of his hands as the Texas Rangers player swung and missed at a pitch in the sixth inning during game three of the American League championship series on Tuesday.

The bat sailed into the stands just behind the Rangers’ dugout and hit a Detroit Tigers male fan wearing a Justin Verlander jersey as the stadium crowd and commentators gasped in horror.

... but the bat sailed into the stands just behind the Rangers' dugout at the ballpark as fans went to grab it...

... and it hit a Detroit Tigers male fan wearing a Justin Verlander jersey as the crowd gasped in horror

Hamilton has a history of unfortunate events in games. In July a Rangers fan fell to his death in a tragic accident after reaching over a railing to try to catch a ball Hamilton tossed into the stands.

The next night, Hamilton hit a foul ball that struck a fan sitting about five rows behind the third-base dugout. He had blood on his face and needed stitches but was treated at the stadium and was OK.

Last night the blow seemed to stun the man at first, but he was evaluated by medical staff at the Comerica Park stadium and stayed in his front-row seat, holding a cold pack on the back of his head.

The bat that went into the stands was returned to the Rangers, who appeared to pass along another one to the dinged-up fan. Security stopped at least one reporter approaching him for an interview.

‘It's a tough way to get a souvenir bat and we hope that gentleman is OK,’ a Major League Baseball (MLB) television commentator said immediately after the incident on Tuesday night.

Jhonny Peralta, Victor Martinez and Miguel Cabrera all hit home runs as the Detroit Tigers clawed their way back into the AL championship series with a 5-2 win over the Texas Rangers on Tuesday.

After losing two games in Texas, the Tigers returned home to trim the Rangers' lead to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series with game four set for Wednesday at Comerica Park.

Last month, with 50,000 fans on their feet in Texas, six-year-old Cooper Stone stood and tossed a ceremonial first pitch of the baseball playoffs to his favourite player, Hamilton.

Cooper is the boy who saw his fireman father Shannon fall to his death while trying to catch a ball thrown to him by Hamilton during a Rangers game in Arlington in early July.
