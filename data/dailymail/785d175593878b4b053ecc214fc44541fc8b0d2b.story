Trainer Mick Channon believes First Class Mail will improve on his debut run when he starts for the second time at Brighton on Thursday.

The chestnut colt, which carries the blue and green colours of the Daily Mail and Mail Online Sport, has been entered for the six-furlong Bibby Financial Services Median Auction Maiden Stakes.

High expectations: Mick Channon believes First Class Mail is capable of winning Thursday's Brighton meeting

The race, scheduled to be the second race on the card, has attracted 15 entries including several who have already been placed in races.

First Class Mail made a pleasing start to his career, showing early pace until tiring in the final furlong when sixth to St Brelades Bay at Windsor on June 28.

Channon said: ‘First Class Mail has definitely improved for his first run. The Brighton race looks the right one for him – I have had it in kind for a couple of weeks – and you would hope he would go there with a decent chance.

‘The ground shouldn’t be a problem. First Class Mail’s dam Hairspray seemed better when it was fast. I probably just wouldn’t want it really testing.’

Riding plans have yet to be finalised but the mount will either be taken by Channon’s stable jockey Willy Twiston-Davies or stable apprentice Charlie Bishop.

Bishop, who has ridden First Class Mail a lot on the gallops, was on board our colt at Windsor.
