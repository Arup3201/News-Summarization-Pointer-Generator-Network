A woman was killed in a terrifying freak accident after her car hit a roundabout and then careered across the roof of a multi-storey car park before landing on the ground below.

Shocked eye-witnesses said the vehicle struck the roundabout at high speed, hurtling it 30ft onto the top floor of the car park where it hit two cars before crashing over the back wall and landing on the ground 10ft below.

Emergency services were called to the 
scene of the horrific smash at 9.15am today, on the edge of the Port of 
Dover in Kent, but were unable to save   her.

Sequence of events: The woman's car hit the roundabout and flew 30ft into the air hitting two cars on a multi-storey car park roof before crash landing on the ground below

Freak accident: The wreckage of the car that was launched into the air after a hitting a roundabout, sending it flying across a rooftop car park. The driver was thrown for the car and died at the scene

Damage: The car smashed into two other vehicles before plunging over the other side of the roof

The woman driver, who has not been identified, was seen being tended to by paramedics on the top floor of the car park after apparently being thrown   clear of the car, but she didn't survive.

The dramatic crash was witnessed by crowds of horrified port workers who were stood around 400m away.

The roundabout is on a slight hill just yards from the concrete building, which sits below it.

P&O Ferries press officer Brian Rees, who saw the crash from his office around 500 yards away, said: 'It was so extraordinary, and happened so quickly,   that for a moment I didn't believe my own eyes.'

Extensive damage: This blue Kia on the roof of the multi-storey car park was destroyed by the impact

The second vehicle damaged in the accident on the roof of the car park. Witnesses said the car was spinning so fast it looked like a propeller

He added: 'The car somehow got up enough speed to 
hit the roundabout, hurtle off the top of the car park at the business 
centre, soaring into the air   somersaulting, debris flying off, end 
over end, and thankfully I couldn't see where it came down to earth.'

'The only thing I can compare it to would be a James Bond movie - for a moment I doubted what I'd just seen.

Emergency: A helicopter hovers above the scene of the accident. Nobody else was hurt in the horror crash

'My immediate reaction was that it would be a miracle to survive such an accident and I'm hearing that it has ended in tragedy.'

Colleague Chris Laming added: 'The car when coming through the air was spinning so fast, end over end, my colleagues thought it was a propeller it was   rotating so quickly.

'Everyone here is absolutely aghast that a car could be going so quickly it could launch itself 30 feet in the air and travel for such a distance   across the car park. It was unbelievable.'

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A car travelling coast-bound on the A20 collided with the Aycliffe roundabout just before 9.15 am this morning.

'The car appears to have been thrown from the roundabout and landed in a nearby car park. The driver, a woman, was declared dead at the scene.

'Police   believe no other vehicles or people were involved.

'The A20 is currently closed coast-bound from the A260 (Courtwood roundabout) while emergency services deal with the incident.'

Police are appealing for witnesses to try and establish how the crash happened.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the moments leading up to the collision, is asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 01622   798538.
