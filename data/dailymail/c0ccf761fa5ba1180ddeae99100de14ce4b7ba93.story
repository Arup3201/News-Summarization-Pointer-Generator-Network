An 81-year-old Florida woman has been jailed indefinitely pending a mental evaluation after being caught repeatedly feeding wild animals.

Mary Musselman, a retired gym teacher from Sebring in Highlands County, will be kept behind bars for violating the terms of her probation, a judge ordered Tuesday morning, according to Fox 13.

Musselman has a history of run-ins with wildlife officers and police over feeding bears in and near her backyard.

She is accused of leaving out up to 18 bowls of dog food for one to three bears at a time.

Elderly Florida woman Mary Musselman has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation after refusing to stop feeding wild animals in her backyard, which officials say is dangerous to the community

Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission officials believe feeding bears results in the animals losing their fear of humans and actively try to stop it, ABC Action News reported.

The officials became aware that Musselman, a fierce animal lover, was feeding a single bear and claim to have 'gone the extra mile' to educate her against it.

They dropped off videos and pamphlets and would routinely call past her home.

'She told us she wasn't going to stop,' Gary Morse, FWC spokesperson told ABC Action News.

Musselman was issued a warning on November 8, but continued feeding the bear.

FWC officers went back to her property on November 19 and reported that Musselman was feeding two more bears.

They gave her more educational videos.

On December 4 she was issued with a court notice for December 6.

Wildlife officials say it is dangerous to feed wild bears because it stops their fear of humans

The judge ordered her to stop feeding all wild animals and FWC officers were ordered to check on her residence weekly.

According to FWC officers, on December 24, Musselman again appeared in court and admitted feeding two to three bears large amounts of food.

'We are talking about putting out as many as 17 or 18 bowls of dog food,' Morse explained.

A judge found her guilty of two counts of feeding wildlife and was placed on probation for one year.

On December 29, FWC officers say they found evidence Musselman was continuing to feed bears.

A judge then ordered FWC officers to arrest her.

According to Morse, when FWC officers arrested Musselman, she threatened to kill the officers and resisted.

'She didn't want to accept that fact that they'd be fine without her...they hibernate when there is no food,' Morse added.

Mary Musselman, 81, a retired gym teacher, reportedly suffers from dementia

After spending a week in jail, Musselman was released on bond and ordered to appear in court on March 3.

However on January 31, officers issued a new arrest after visiting her home and seeing that food had been left out.

Musselman's attorney, William Fletcher, said that it was bread left out for crows.

However police said that still violated Musselman's court order not to feed any wild animals.

Musselman appeared in court today looking frail.

Fletcher said a medical evaluation concluded that she suffers from Alzheimer's and dementia, and he requested that the judge place her in alternate housing, such as her brother's home in Illinois.

The judge, however, said he wanted a more complete mental evaluation and ordered Musselman to be held in a secure facility until then, so she will remain behind bars.
