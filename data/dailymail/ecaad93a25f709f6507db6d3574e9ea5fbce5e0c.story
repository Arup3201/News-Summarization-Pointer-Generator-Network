Fabio Capello claims Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is failing to get the best from summer signing Luis Suarez.

Suarez, who signed for Barca from Liverpool in a £75million deal in July, has been mainly deployed in a wide position from Enrique and has scored just two goals in 10 games for the Catalan giants.

Russia manager Capello believes the Uruguay forward would be more help to the team if playing centrally.

Barcelona star Luis Suarez is being wasted out wide, claims Russia manager Fabio Capello 

'His coach knows more than us, but the wing is not the best place for Suarez,' Capello told Onda Cero.

'He's a goalscorer and you lose 50 per cent of that on the wing.

'You need to be in the centre, not on the wing. Luis Suarez is one of the best strikers in the world and I think that Luis Enrique is trying to find a tactical solution to this.

'While I think this Barcelona team has the same desire to hoard the ball as before, they do not have the same speed as they used to.'

Capello believes Manchester City will need a fit Sergio Aguero to defeat Barcelona next year

The former England boss also declared that Barcelona should have little trouble brushing aside Manchester City in the forthcoming Champions League last 16 matches.

The only way the English champions can win is to hope Sergio Aguero is fit, thinks Capello.

He added: 'I do not think Man City will be a difficult opponent for Barcelona,' he added. 'City did not do well in qualifying because they are missing something - they lack speed and they lack desire.

'At this point, they would be easy opponents for Barca. But, in February we'll see because they will have [injured forward] Sergio Aguero back. He's one of the best players in world football.'
