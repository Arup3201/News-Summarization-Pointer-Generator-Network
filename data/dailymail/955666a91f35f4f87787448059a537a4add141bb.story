John McCain's office is denying reports that Syrian rebels the senator was pictured with were responsible for the kidnap of Lebanese Shi'ites.

According to the Lebanese press, two of the men pictured with Mr McCain had taken eleven people from Lebanon hostage.

Nine of the pilgrims are still being held a year after they were taken hostage as they returned to Beirut from a pilgrimage in Iran.

Rebel meeting: Senator John McCain has been accused of posing with members of Northern Storm

As negotiations continue for the release of the remaining hostages, the Daily Star in Beirut claims to have identified two of the men pictured with Mr McCain as being with the Northern Storm group believed to be behind the kidnapping.

Mr McCain's spokesman Brian Rogers told Buzzfeed: 'A number of the Syrians who greeted 
Senator McCain upon his arrival in Syria asked to take pictures with 
him, and as always, the Senator complied.'

He added it 'would be regrettable' if any of the men turned out to be the suspected kidnappers, Mohamed Nour and Abu Ibrahim.

The senator's spokesman added that Mr McCain did not condone 'the kidnapping of Lebanese Shia pilgrims
 or [have] any communication with those responsible'.

Secret visit: John McCain made a brief stop in Syria to meet leaders of the rebel opposition on Monday

Anwar Ibrahim, one
 of the men taken hostage by the Northern Storm group, claims he recognized
 Mohammad Nour, chief spokesman and photographer for the kidnappers, 
standing next to Mr McCain.

'I recognized him immediately. He was the photographer who was brought in to take our photos. He works with the kidnappers. He knows them very well,' Mr Ibrahim told the Daily Star.

He also claims to have recognized another man associated with the hostage-takers.

However, Mr Rogers said none of the people Mr McCain met on his brief trip to Syria on Monday shared the names of the kidnappers.

'As the Syrian Emergency Task Force has 
said: "Senator McCain did not go to Syria to meet with anyone named 
Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim. Two members of our organization were 
present in the meeting, and no one called himself by either name",' he added.

The senator's spokesman suggested the story could be part of the Assad-regime's propaganda, adding: 'It’s not surprising that the 
pro-Hezbollah forces supporting the Assad regime who originally promoted
 this distortion would seek to smear anything and anyone supporting the 
Syrian opposition.'

Mr McCain traveled to Syria to meet leaders of the rebel opposition, who have asked the U.S for weapons and airstrikes against Hezbollah and Assad's forces.

Since the civil war began after peaceful protests were met with violence about two years ago, at least 80,000 people have been killed.

Mr McCain has been critical of President Obama for not taking enough action in the crisis, according to Politico.
