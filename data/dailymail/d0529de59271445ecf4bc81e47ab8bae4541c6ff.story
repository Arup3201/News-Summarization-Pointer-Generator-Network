Minnesota Vikings linebacker Erin Henderson has been arrested again for drunk driving, just seven weeks after his previous arrest.

Henderson was booked into jail on Wednesday afternoon and was still in custody Thursday morning in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, according to Carver County online records.

He's facing four charges, three for driving while intoxicated and one for a suspended license, after allegedly crashing his car into a bunch of trees, TMZ reported.

The athlete was allegedly speeding when he lost control of his SUV and skidded through a parking lot before crashing into several trees, the website reported.

He was arrested in Chanhassen, a suburb near Vikings headquarters in Eden Prairie, and had to take a sobriety test.

Henderson was reportedly released on a $12,000 bail on Thursday afternoon.

The Vikings say they are aware of the matter, and gathering information, but have no further comment for now.

The team's statement read: 'We are aware of the matter involving Erin Henderson. We are continuing to gather informatoin and will have further comment at the appropriate time.'

Henderson was also arrested Nov. 19 in Eden Prairie on suspicion of DWI and drug possession, one of three arrests involving Vikings players that month.
