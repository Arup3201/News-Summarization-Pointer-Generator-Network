A Indiana woman's two sons were killed in separate shootings only separated by a few weeks during the holiday season.

Melissa William's 25-year-old son Dominique D. Wright was killed in a December 4 shooting. Her 19-year-old son, Vincennes University student Donnovan Williams, died New Year's Day.

Their aunt, Andrea Wright, told NWITimes.com that her sister is distraught because of her sons' deaths.

'[Donnovan] was home from college and just got caught up in a horrible incident. His mother has lost two sons,' she told the website. 

Victim: 19-year-old Donnovan Williams, pictured, died New Year's Day after a shooting that same day. His 25-year-old brother Dominique D. Wright was killed December 4 in a different shooting 

Scene: The New Year's Day shooting occurred on Wilson Place at a house party, and Donnovan Williams died at a Munster hospital

She continued 'They just buried Dominique, and he was home on break trying to console her.'

Dominique Wright was killed in a shooting that took place on Interstate 80/94 in Indiana, police told NWITimes.com. Police also said he suffered numerous gunshot wounds and prior to his death exchanged gunfire with Terrill K. Fenderson.

Fenderson's body was discovered the morning of December 5, with his death was caused by gunshot wounds suffered, police told the website.

Andrea Wright told the media outlet that Dominique worked as a factory machinist, was a father to an eight-month-old child and had been taking online classes for self-improvement. 

She said that her younger nephew Donnovan  was shot while at a Hammond house party.

College student: Donnovan Williams, pictured, went to Vincennes University and was the first family member that attended college

The shooting occurred on Wilson Place, and he died inside a Munster hospital - though no more information  has  been released by police, NWITimes.com reported. 

According to the website, Williams studied engineering and was the first family member that attended college.

Another two college students were victims in the shooting, one of whom is now out of the hospital, though the other continues to stay there, Andrea Wright told NWITimes.com.

Speaking about Donnovan, Wright said 'He's a young kid, a good kid who's never been in trouble. He was trying to get his life started. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, at a party he shouldn't have gone to.'

Wright also said that family members were very proud of Donnovan going to college and had wished for the 19-year-old to be able to escape the area. 

'He was a loving, supportive young man with a bright future ahead of him,' she also told the website. 'He was warm, funny, and affectionate. He loved to give hugs. College had always been a goal for him. He was just trying to get his life started.'

A GoFundMe page for his funeral expenses has been set up.
