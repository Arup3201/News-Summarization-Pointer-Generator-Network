Adnan Januzaj is willing to play for the Manchester United youth sides for as long as it takes to impress new manager Louis van Gaal.

The young Belgian   scored a hat-trick for  United's Under 21s on Monday but has not started a competitive game for the senior side since Van Gaal took charge.

The 19-year-old remains hopeful however that his application  will lead to him becoming a first-team regular soon.

Louis van Gaal was in the stands at Old Trafford to see the Belgian's hat-trick for United's 21s

Januzaj was only given eight minutes as a substitute against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday

Januzaj told MUTV: 'I played a lot of games last season and I'm trying to impress the manager once again and get games again this year as well.

'I tried to do my best. Obviously, even if it's reserves level, I always have to show myself and improve. I got a hat-trick but I think I worked hard defensively as well and these are the kind of things I have to do now and at first-team level.

'I don't do for it for any other people but for myself. I look after my [performance]. Even if I have to play Under 18s, I have to do it and try to improve every time I play.'

The youngster burst onto the scene last season with a stunning double away at Sunderland 

Januzaj has found his first-team opportunites limited by the arival of established stars like Angel Di Maria
