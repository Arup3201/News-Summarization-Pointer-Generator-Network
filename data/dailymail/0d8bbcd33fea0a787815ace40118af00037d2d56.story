A horror car crash victim who has undergone 22 operations has been told he can’t have the final procedure to help him walk again.

Duncan Buckley, 35, was given just a five per cent chance of survival after the car he was driving was involved in a head-on crash with a van.

The crash - in 2010 - resulted in him suffering a fractured skull, broken collarbone, hairline spinal fracture, nerve damage, elbow damage, three broken ribs, collapsed lungs, bruised heart, lacerated liver and spleen, smashed left knee, two fractured femurs and a broken ankle.

Mr Buckley's car after the horror crash: He was placed in a six week induced coma and was incredibly lucky to survive his ordeal

He was put into an induced coma for six weeks and when he came round all he could move was his eyes and tongue.

Mr Buckley is now on his way to recovery but needs one final operation to cure a problem with his left leg - which he has been denied due to an NHS postcode lottery,

His left leg is one and 3/4 inches shorter than the right - and he needs an ISKD nail to lengthen it.The nail costs £3,000 - but would enable him to walk unaided for the first time since the crash.

But South Staffordshire PTC has refused to carry out the procedure saying it is not ‘exceptional’.

Mr Buckley said: 'It’s really frustrating, I was hoping the operation would shut the door on this nightmare. I want to get my life back.

'Because one leg is shorter than the other as a result of my injuries I can’t balance at the moment. I have to walk with sticks.

'In future it could lead to hip problems and back problems. I was told because of where I live, it’s not on the list of procedures that they do. It’s a post code lottery.'

He added: 'I can’t work at the moment but I want to get back to my job as a web tutor.

'I have been through every emotion possible. I’ve suffered from depression and it’s been a complete rollercoaster. I’m disappointed with the hospital’s decision.'

After the accident near Shifnal, Shropshire, Duncan was cut out of his car and airlifted to hospital - where doctors fought for hours to save him.

Mr Buckley said: 'It was touch and go for a while. Doctors weren’t hopeful that I would live.

'When I came out of the coma, I was in hospital solid for 12 months. It was terrible and very stressful.I had lots of muscle waste and I went from 14 stone to just seven stone.

'My knee had to be rebuilt and I’ve still got metal screws in my elbow and ankle.'

His wife, Lisa-Marie, 42, said: 'We can’t complete this journey until he’s had this operation. To stop now is cruel. We were in tears when we found out.'

Tamsin Carr, spokesman for the Staffordshire Cluster of PCTs said: 'The treatment is not routinely commissioned for patients in South Staffordshire. We believe there is an alternative treatment available but that would have to be confirmed by the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.'
