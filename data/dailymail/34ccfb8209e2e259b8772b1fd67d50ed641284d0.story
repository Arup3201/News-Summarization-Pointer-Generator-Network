A designer has come up with a handy invention by creating the world's first bike that lets you pedal with your feet and arms.

The unique device called Varibike looks like a regular bicycle, with traditional foot pedals, but additionally comes with a set of cranks that the rider turns with their arms to make it easier and faster when cycling.

It was designed by 43-year-old Martin Kraiss, from Ulm in Germany and costs £4,000.

The Varibike allows the rider to use their whole body to ride the bike and the person behind the invention is confident it goes faster than regular bicycles.

Kraiss said: 'Cycling had always been too one-sided for me as the power only comes from the legs.

'The upper body is static, it gets no exercise and is completely neglected.

'Our objective was to create a bicycle which is driven by the whole body that is even faster than a conventional bicycle.'

A recent study by the New Mexico State University found that although the same heart rate is achieved with an arm- and leg-powered drive, the cyclist can achieve 31 per cent more power.

In addition, the continuous power output is higher so the overall workout is more effective.

The aluminium bike weighs 15kg, costs around £4,000 and can be bought in a one-sized frame in white, black and gold.

A recent study by the New Mexico State University found that although the same heart rate is achieved when arm cranks are added to a bicycle, like those on the Varibike, pictured, an arm- and leg-powered drive gives a cyclist 31 per cent more power

Mr Kraiss added: 'Because you have 30 per cent more power it is easier to climb hills and the rider can go faster.

'It is also easier on longer rides as you can use arm and leg drive in varying intensity, allowing individual muscle groups to relax repeatedly while riding.

'It is more fun when you can vary between different cycling styles and alternate by using your arms and legs.

'You have more drive power and you are faster, particularly when climbing hills.

'You can choose to do high intense work out, cardio training or just cruise around. Wherever you go with the Varibike you exercise your whole body.'

Our objective was to create a bicycle which is driven by the whole body that is even faster than a conventional bicycle.'

The 43-year-old designer claims the bike wasn't designed solely for pro-cyclists and can also be used by anyone during 'leisure time when cycling with friends and family'

Mr Kraiss also revealed he uses it in his spare time and the Varibike hasn't been designed solely for pro-cyclists.

'When you're riding the bike it feels amazing. It's incredible fun powering the Varibike with the whole body.

'I use it when ever I need a transportation device, or in my leisure time when cycling with friends or family.'

Kraiss has also designed an indoor version of his Varibike to 'beat the lousy weather.'

This indoor version comes with tilting technology that lets the rider lean left and right, to mimic cycling outdoors, and costs around £1600.
