There Is something romantic about one of the supreme footballers of all time passing away just as his country of birth comes to the climax of its bid to win the World Cup.

Vamos, vamos Argentina – in memory of Alfredo The Great.

There is a consoling grace about Senor Di Stefano taking his leave of we mere mortals having just celebrated his 88th birthday in his usual affectionate company of family and friends.

VIDEO Real Madrid great De Stefano dies ages 88

This gentleman lived his 88 years to the full.

There is a sense of history about the ultimate Real Madrileno bidding us farewell even as the Argentine successor to his throne in Spain is striving to join him among the top five players ever.

Arise to the occasion, Lionel Messi, destiny beckons in Brazil these coming days.

There is something uncanny, from our peculiarly English perspective, about The Maestro taking his final bow just as the Promenade Concert season is about to open at the Royal Albert Hall.

Because Di Stefano’s unique mastery of the game in all its facets may best be described as him being, not only the virtuoso, but also the composer and conductor of every football orchestra in which he played.

To watch him was to be enchanted by the creative magic he wove in midfield, to marvel at his reading and control of the game, to be astonished by his genius for scoring goals.

To see him for the first time – as did a multitude of privileged Scots among the 127,621 crowd at Hampden Park and my generation of Englishmen on black-and-white television – was to be awoken to football so alien that it might have come not from Madrid but from Mars.

That occasion, on a balmy Glasgow evening in May 1960, celebrated the fifth of the consecutive triumphs with which Real launched the European Cup into orbit.

It remains, in our memory as living witnesses, the most wondrous of all the finals in this competition, by whatever name it is known.

Di Stefano had scored in the four preceding finals. There was never a doubt he would do so again on this night and more than half a century later he is still the only man to score on five of these occasions.

Just to make sure, he ran up a hat-trick. His illustrious left-hand man Ferenc Puskas went one better as they claimed all Real’s goals between them in a 7-3 victory which also starred Gento and Del Sol.

What made it all the more impressive was that Eintrach Frankfurt were typically formidable German opponents, who actually took the lead before the avalanche.

For many of us, football changed that night.

To see Di Stefano in person, as I was fortunate to do on a trip to Madrid not long before he departed Real in 1964, was to pay homage to the master.

By then Don Alfredo had gone a mighty long way towards scoring a phenomenal 485 goals in 664  club appearancs for River Plate and Huracan in Argentina, Millonarios in Colombia, Real and finally Espanyol in Spain.

In addition to those five European Cups, he racked up a host of league and cup-winners’ medals in all three of those countries and had twice been elected European Footballer of the Year.

510 official matches played by Di Stefano for five clubs: River Plate and Huracan in Argentina, Millonarios in Colombia and Real Madrid and Espanyol in Spain.

418 goals scored in his club career.

3 countries represented. Di Stefano played for Colombia and Argentina early in his career before later moving to, and playing for, Spain.

22 club trophies won as a player, including eight league titles and five consecutive European Cups with Real Madrid between 1956 and 1960.

5 Di Stefano scored in all five of those European Cup finals with Madrid, including a hat-trick in the last one against Eintracht Frankfurt in Glasgow.12 teams managed, including Valencia, Real Madrid and fierce Argentinean rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate.

6 trophies won as a manager, including a league and cup double with Boca Juniors. He won five runners-up medals with Real Madrid but managed just one title with Los Blancos - the 1990 Spanish Super Cup

So desperately sought after was Di Stefano in Spain that his transfer from Millonarios in 1953 was a matter of huge controversy.

He had signed a first option to Barcelona but when their president questioned his value and hesitated, Real stepped in.

Issues remained with River Plate, who retained his registration in Argentina.

FIFA washed their hands of the mess and with the Spanish FA split on Barca v Madrid party lines there was much speculation that General Franco, Spain’s dictator, applied pressure for them to approve di Stefano’s signing for Real, of whom he was an avid supporter.

It is more certain that Franco rubber-stamped second citizenship for the Buenos Aires-born di Stefano so he could play for Spain.

FIFA had not recognised his four appearances for Colombia, while with Millonarios, but they refused initially to approve the Spanish request because he had played half a dozen times for Argentina.

They relented, following diplomatic entreaties from Madrid.

That complicated Di Stefano’s international career. A combination of  injuries and failures by Argentina and Spain to qualify deprived him of participation in the World Cup Finals.

That was football’s loss, also.

Even so, he scored 29 goals in his 37 official appearances for Argentina and Spain.

His exceptional football intelligence carried over into management, where he won multiple leagues and cups in Argentina and with Valencia in Spain.

However, he was cursed to come second in five competitions in one season with Real, including the 1983 European Cup Winners’ Cup Final defeat by Aberdeen which, not least because of Di Stefano’s illustrious presence in the opposite dug-out, Sir Alex Ferguson counts as one of his greatest successes.

That did not stop Real loving him. The feeling was mutual as he and Gento expressed to a few of us, Bobby Moore included, on one long, warm evening London in the 90s.

It was an education to listen to him reflecting nostalgically on the attacking spirit which had been at the founding heart of the greatest of all club  teams.

Real made him their honorary president. They gave him a permanent, rent-free home in a most pleasant apartment close by the Bernabeu, near which he was walking when the suffered his second, and this time fatal, heart attack.

The Blond Arrow, 
as he was known, has flown. He leaves to Pele’s tribute: ‘The most 
complete footballer in the history of the game.’

That
 he was, even if Pele’s mountain of goals, Diego Maradona’s dramatic 
talents and Garrincha’s magical ball skills – all World Cup-winning – 
probably out-rank him in this all-time list:

1) Pele
