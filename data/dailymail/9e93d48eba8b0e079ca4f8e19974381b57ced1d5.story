Successful: Emma Bridgewater's designs adorn the homes of middle-class families across the UK

Her distinctive designs adorn the homes of middle-class families across the country.

But Emma Bridgewater admits that her own family paid the price for that success.

The 53-year-old, famous for her polka dot patterns, said she felt ‘guilty’ at having to make her pottery business work while bringing up a young family.

The stress of running her factory in Stoke-on-Trent eventually became too much and she handed over the reins to her husband Matthew Rice six years ago.

Bridgewater, who is worth an estimated £14million, started her business in 1985 after spotting a niche in the market when she could not find a mug she liked to give to her mother.

But as her success grew, she had that feeling ‘that when you’re at home you feel guilty about work and when you’re at work you feel guilty about home’.

She
 said: ‘It was insane. My mother was quite sure that it wasn’t right 
that we all went to work when our babies were tiny, she thought we all 
should be at home looking after them.

‘Why we’ve done this to ourselves, I don’t know. Except, I am proud of Stoke, and the factory and the company.

‘When I finally said to my husband, “I think you might have to run the company for a bit”, he said: “why did you wait so long?”

She added that she felt it ‘quite harsh’ to have to hand over the reins to her husband, but then found a new love of writing books.

Bridgewater, from Oxford, made her comments during an appearance at the Hay Festival in Wales yesterday.

Her new 
book, Toast & Marmalade and Other Stories, is a memoir which 
recounts the home counties upbringing which inspired her work.

Her designs, she said, were modelled on her mother’s china, which ‘never matched’ but each piece had a special value of its own.

But in 1991, her mother Charlotte had a horse riding accident while hunting at the age of just 52, and never recovered from the brain damage.

Bridgewater said: ‘It was awful. It did make a big catastrophic hole in our lives.

‘Her horse fell on the road and she snacked her head. Extraordinarily she died several times.

‘Although 
it was a bad outlook they went ahead and operated. She was in a coma for
 three months and when she came around she was speechless.

‘But she lived another 22 years in a very strange, shadowy version. Not with us at all.’

But although looking after her infirm 
mother was difficult and heart-breaking, Bridgewater said it 
‘spurred her on’ in her career.

She added: ‘I think it’s been quite inspiring. People say that sadness is a spur. And I felt very angry about it – and I feel that it’s probably fired me along the motorway.

‘She died 
in December. We had the most fantastic funeral for her. All the bad 
stuff went away and she came rushing back. I was terrified that people 
would forget what she’d been like. 

‘It was a joyful relief that her troubles were over.’

Bridgewater said she hoped her 
company could become an inspiration for others and that the British 
manufacturing industry could be ‘revived’.

She said she ‘wasn’t prepared’ for the ‘wasteland’ she found in Stoke when she decided to bring an old Victorian factory back into life to manufacture her designs.

She added: ‘I can’t understand the idea that we might lose touch with our manufacturing.

‘We can’t do without making. We have lost confidence in ourselves. We are not happy about emblazoning “made in Britain” on things.’ 

She added that it was ‘jolly annoying’ that students in art schools were creating ‘installations to titillate Charles Saatchi’ rather than learning how to make practical products.

And she also bemoaned the breaking up of the polytechnic system, which she said may be linked to the current unemployment crisis.

Bridgewater has three shops in London, and one in Edinburgh, as well as an outlet located at the company’s factory in Stoke-on-Trent. Her designs are sold by both John Lewis and Fortnum & Mason.

In 2012, she launched a collection of Royal commemorative ware to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Her eldest daughter Elizabeth, 24, is training in circus skills at Giffords, and Kitty, 23, is studying illustration in London. 

Margaret, 17, and Michael, 14, are boarders at Bedales, where Miss Bridgewater's father and her husband both went.
