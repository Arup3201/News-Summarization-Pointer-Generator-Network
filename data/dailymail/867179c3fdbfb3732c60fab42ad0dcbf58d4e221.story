Two Premier League football clubs are advertising long internships which pay no salary, it has emerged.

Reading and Wigan have come under fire for looking to take on unpaid full-time back-room staff next season.

The revelations come as the Government looks to clamp down on companies who are using unpaid interns long term.

Cheap: The role at Reading is described as a performance analyst but as well as being unpaid it does not pay travel expenses

Both clubs are advertising the positions on the UK Sport website. The role at Reading is described as a performance analyst ‘to assist the Senior Performance Analyst in providing performance feedback (statistical and video) to Reading FC First Team’ .

However, it adds: ‘this role is unpaid and includes no travel expenses’.

Wigan are also looking to recruit three 
performance analysts whose ‘main duties will include filming of games 
and training sessions, live and post-match coding, statistical analysis 
and video creation’. The job is also unpaid.

It emerged yesterday that Employment minister Jo Swinson has passed the details of more than 100 companies to HM Revenue and Customs.

They are accused of breaking the law 
by using interns in positions which would normally be subject to 
national minimum wage rules.

According
to The Independent, in a letter to Intern Aware, she wrote: 'The list 
of employers that you provided will be treated as 
intelligence by HMRC.'

Despite paying no salary the requirements for the job at Reading are particularly demanding.

Applicants should hold or be completing a postgraduate degree in performance analysis or Sports Science.

They should also have a performance analysis background, with some previous experience of working in Professional/Semi-Pro Football.

The Wigan job is an ‘intern’ by title 
but requires the successful applicant to ‘work primarily within the 
Academy across all age groups up to Under 21 level, and will spend some 
time working alongside the First Team Analysis Department.

The role involves ‘filming of games and training sessions, live and post-match coding, statistical analysis and video creation’.

The
description claims the ‘hours of work will be flexible and will include
weekends and some evening work’ but the applicant requires a ‘high work
ethic’.

Speaking to the Independent, a spokesman for the Department of Business said: 'The law on the 
National Minimum Wage is clear.

'If somebody on a work experience 
placement or internship is a worker under NMW legislation, then they are
entitled to the minimum wage.'

Wigan Athletic have not commented
but Reading defended the internship as an important part of career 
progression for an individual.
