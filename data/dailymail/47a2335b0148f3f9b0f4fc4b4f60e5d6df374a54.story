Tyson Fury has been exchanging letters with Charles Bronson and has revealed that his beard is inspired by Britain's most violent prisoner.

Fury goes toe-to-toe with fellow Brit Dereck Chisora at London's ExCel Arena on Saturday night in a WBO world title final eliminator to set up a bout with champion Wladimir Klitschko.

And ahead of the fight 26-year-old Fury admitted to having communication with Bronson, who has spent most of the last 40 years locked up for violent crimes, and even plans on visiting him when he has the time.

'I have written to him a couple of times and he has written back to me. It was just general stuff between us. You could say I suppose the letters were one crazy man to another,' Fury told The Sun's Pat Sheehan.

'I'm really busy at the moment but I would like to go and see him when I get the time.'

The heavyweight claims Bronson's famous beard was the inspiration behind his own facial hair, which he may be forced to shave off before the fight.

Fury has admitted that his inactivity is his only weakness against Chisora

The British Boxing Board of Control  has a rule that states a boxer's chin must be visible when fighting, and Fury says he has no problems shaving the beard.

'I was originally inspired by the beard that Charles Bronson grew.'

'If Chisora's camp want me to shave it off because of some rule, then fine, I will take it off, no problem. If they want me to shave down below, I'll do that as well or maybe they want me to have a waxing... I'll do that for them too.'
