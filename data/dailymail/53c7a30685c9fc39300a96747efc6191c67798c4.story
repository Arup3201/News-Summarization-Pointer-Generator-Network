Star Wars actor Mark Hamill has arrived in the Republic of Ireland to film scenes for the upcoming Episode VII sporting his beard and greying hair.

The 62-year-old, who played Luke Skywalker in the original series, has grown the facial hair for his return to the series which is currently being filmed in County Kerry.

He was spotted in between sets outside the Butler Arms Hotel in the village of Waterville which has been taken over by sci-fi fans wanting to catch a glimpse of the cast.

The hotel is on the coast, close to the UNESCO Heritage site Skellig Michael, which has been closed to the public for the last three days for filming. 

Fishing vessels have been told not to sail the island off the coast of County Kerry, so they do not disrupt the cast and crew during production.

Hamill revealed last week that he had to grow the beard for the seventh film and described his casting as 'an unexpected gift'.

'I thought even if they did a third trilogy, we couldn't be involved because it's really about the new generation of characters,' he said.

'You know we're just there to lend our support and grow contractually obligated beards. It was certainly unexpected. 

He added: 'I already had a beginning, middle and end. I never thought we'd come back. To go on to those sets that evoked so many memories, it is just astonishing. It just seems like an unexpected gift.' 

The cast, director JJ Abrams, and the enormous crew, all arrived on the Northern Ireland coast yesterday to begin filming on location.

It is understood that at least 12 private boat operators have had their services booked up for the days of the shoot as they ferry transported cast, crew, and equipment over to Skellig in the morning and back again last night.

All B&Bs and hotels in the area have been booked out for the week as a result.

Yesterday, the team behind the shoot clashed with conservationists over their occupation of a remote island.

Heritage chiefs and environmentalists have warned about the impact on the rocky outcrop.

The steep island, which dramatically rises more than 700 feet out of the Atlantic Ocean, is home to puffins, manx shearwaters and storm petrels as well as Guillemots and Kittiwakes.

Film director JJ Adams and actor Mark Hamill - who played Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy - are among the cast and crew on the set of the latest production, Star Wars: Episode VII.

John O’Sullivan, of tourist company Skellig Experience, said on Thursday: ‘If the weather is fine, the camera work out there could be stunning. The scenery is spectacular up there. It’s a majestic and mysterious place.'

Meanwhile, Harrison Ford has been pictured
 walking unaided at Santa Monica Airport in the U.S. as he arrived on 
the tarmac to take his Cessna T182T plane for a ride.

The 
72-year-old had been using a hands-free iWalk after breaking his left 
ankle during filming for Star Wars: Episode 7 in early June.

The father-of-five appeared to be back to his best as he walked towards his small plane, however a golf buggy was seen waiting to transport him.
