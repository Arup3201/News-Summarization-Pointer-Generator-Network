Barack Obama's tricky first presidential visit to Israel has had another glitch after the President was caught on an open-mic joking to the country's prime minister that the trip had allowed him to 'get away from Congress'.

The off-the-cuff remark was made during a welcoming ceremony at Tel Aviv airport on Wednesday as Obama stood between Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

As a trumpet fanfare played, Obama can be heard saying to Netanyahu: 'It's good to get away from Congress.'

Woops! A microphone was on and picked up Barack Obama telling Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that it was 'good to get away from Congress' in Tel Aviv on Wednesday

Chuckles: Obama made the aside to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) who looked amused by the remark

Obama and Netanyahu both had a little chuckle over his remark before the U.S. President moved on to a meet and greet with Israeli officials.

House Speaker John Boehner was asked about Obama's remarks by CNN's Jake Tapper later on Wednesday to which he gave a somewhat light-hearted response.

Boehner said: 'I'd rather be heckled than ignored. Or as I like to say, you only tease the ones you love.'

Obama's on-mic gaffe is the latest hiccup for the U.S. leader on his historic first trip to the Jewish state.

First his $1.5 million armored car 
known as 'Beast' broke down in embarrassing circumstances on Wednesday 
morning and later it appeared that his Israeli hosts had dug up a 
magnolia tree he planted in the name of peace.

The
 tree was brought over from the U.S. as a gift and was planted by Obama along with Israel's veteran 
President Shimon Peres at his home in Jerusalem.

Holding a press photo-call for the joint-planting, both presidents smiled as the sapling magnolia was put into the ground.

President Obama told President Peres: 'It is an
 incredible honor to offer this tree to this beautiful garden, and to 
someone who is champion of the Israeli people and a champion of peace.'

However, The Times of Israel and
 Israeli news website Ynet reported that on the president's departure, 
the tree was unceremoniously dug up by the agricultural ministry and 
taken away to be tested for pests.

According to the Times of Israel, 'Plants cannot be brought in from abroad 'without undergoing a check' by the ministry, the report quotes the bureaucrats as saying. If this were April 1, we'd assume this was a wind-up.'

'As President of the United States Barack Obama has brought the plant with him and because agricultural products are not allowed into Israel from abroad without passing inspection - for fear diseases or pests are found on the plant itself - it will be uprooted for testing.'

The tests could, according to Ynet take months - and only if it does will it be allowed to be re-planted in the president's home.

A White House official did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment about the magnolia tree on Wednesday.

During his diplomatic visit, Obama will have to navigate several hugely contentious issues such as Iranian nuclear ambitions, Palestinian relations and future of the Arab Spring.

However, Ayelet Frish, a spokesman for Shimon Peres' office has denied that a diplomatic gaffe has occurred and said that Israel had been aware of the plans to bring the tree for months.

He is not clear if the White House was aware that the tree would be dug up.Â 

Earlier, Obama's armored limo broke down on the way to the airport. The custom General Motors Cadillac limo was relegated to a pick-up truck after the driver accidentally put gas in the engine instead of diesel.

Obama arrived in Tel Aviv on 
Wednesday afternoon local time, and earlier that morning, the limo that 
was designated to his hotel was unable to move after the driver made the
 silly mistake.

Local 
news reports allege that it was the President's limo that was shipped 
over specially from Washington that broke down so he was forced to use 
the second vehicle that they brought over from the U.S.

Big mistake: The 18-foot car has an tank that holds 6.5 liters of diesel, and does not work when given gas

The United States Secret Service put out a statement about the incident, saying that it was a situation where it pays for them to be prepared.

'One of our protective vehicles experienced mechanical problems in Israel earlier today. This is why we bring multiple vehicles and a mechanic on all trips,' said Edwin Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service.

'Situations like this are planned for extensively by our advance teams so that the President's itinerary is unaffected by these types of issues.'
