His girlfriend may not like the city very much, but Manchester United  goalkeeper David de Gea seems to be having a good enough time.

The Spanish stopper, who has been Louis van Gaal's stand-out performer this season, spent his Friday night working with children for the club's foundation.

De Gea posted photos of the event to his Twitter and Instagram account, and said he'd had a training with the kids.

'A great evening playing with the children from the @manchesterunited Foundation,' he wrote. 'We spent a fun time!'

De Gea's status at Old Trafford is under threat, with Real Madrid reportedly interested in the Spanish star whose contract runs out at the end of next season, and his girlfriend, Edurne Garcia, commenting that she doesn't care for Manchester. 

The 29-year-old was asked, on Spanish TV, 'I've been told Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge', and replied: 'It's not very nice, that's for sure. You have to hunt out specific places, the nice places.

'But even then Spain is nicer. The reason I like it is because David's there. With him being there, everything looks wonderful.'
