A worker has filed a federal lawsuit after colleagues allegedly pinned a 'Kick Me' sign to his back and then repeatedly kicked him.

Intel employee Harvey Palacio said the 'prank' left him feeling ashamed and upset him so much that he cried on the way home.

According to the lawsuit filed in Albuquerque, co-workers at the Rio Rancho Intel plant laughed hysterically as they kicked him during the stunt in August.

Mr Palacio said he went to senior staff member Randy Lehman to ask if there was something on his back but said he joined in.

'Lehman said turn around and as Palacio 
did he saw and heard (another employee) yell out "Don't read it, just do
it",' the lawsuit said.

Lehman then kicked Palacio three times in his buttocks, according court documents.

Another
employee, Chris Zeltinger, who the lawsuit said exchanged Christmas 
gifts with Palacio, kicked him twice as he was seeking help to remove 
the sign.

'Palacio decided that this could not continue and walked back in front of the group to ask someone else to remove it,' the lawsuit said.

'Palacio felt demoralized and assaulted and he began to cry during the drive home. He could not tell his wife because he was so embarrassed and ashamed.'

In addition, Palacio said co-workers would hide his work uniform and filled his work bag with trash. He claims the abuse he faced over a few months was racially motivated because he's Filipino.

The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount for damages and attorney's fees.

Lehman
and Zeltinger were later convicted of petty misdemeanor battery and 
ordered to perform 16 hours of community service. Both also lost their 
Intel jobs because of the prank.

Intel Corp. spokeswoman told The Associated Press that the company is reviewing the lawsuit and declined to comment further.

Diego Esquibel, Lehman's attorney, called the episode 'extremely unfortunate' and said Lehman and has not forgotten about the victim.

'He is truly sorry for any shame, sadness or pain the victim felt and his actions were never meant to cause any of those things,' Esquibel said.

'My client gave a heartfelt apology at sentencing and his feelings and statements have not changed.'

Zeltinger could not be contacted by The Associated Press.
