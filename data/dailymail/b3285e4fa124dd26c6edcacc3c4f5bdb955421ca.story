An apartment under construction at a luxury Manhattan high-rise is set to go on sale with the most expensive price tag in New York City history.

The 12,394-square-foot triplex penthouse at 520 Park Avenue will offer one buyer plenty of space, and some priceless views, for a very, very pricey $130 million.

The previous record for a New York City apartment was the $88 million paid by Ekaterina Rybolovlev, daughter of Russian billionaire Dmitry, for a penthouse at 15 Central Park West in 2012.

The 12,394-square-foot triplex penthouse at 520 Park Avenue will offer one buyer plenty of space, and some priceless views for $130 million.

The triplex unit also has a 1,257-square-foot terrace with views of Central Park to the north

That 6700-square-foot apartment will still hold the record for price per square foot even if the triplex gets its asking price however, with a price of a little over $13,000 a square foot as opposed to the $10,000 a square foot being charged for the residence at 520 Park Avenue.

Both 520 Park Avenue and 15 Central Park West were built by the Zeckendorf Development Company.

According to Curbed, some of the amenities being offered at 520 Park Avenue are a bi-level health and fitness center, a swimming pool room with hand-carved stone walls, a spa area, a children's playroom, a screening area, and a private wine cellar.

Sales of units in the building, which is scheduled to be completed in 2017, will begin in the first quarter of next year

The triplex unit also has a 1,257-square-foot terrace with views of Central Park to the north, according to Bloomberg News. 

The 51-story tower, designed by architect Robert A.M. Stern, sits on the corner of Park Avenue and 60th Street, just a few blocks from Central Park.

For those who can't afford the $130 million penthouse, there other options in the building,which will include seven duplexes of about 9,138 square feet each, starting at $67 million, and single-floor units of about 4,600 square feet, which will start at $16.2 million.

This is not the only pricey real estate to hit the market of recent either in the Big Apple, with celebs like Kelly Ripa and Sarah Jessica Parker unloading their luxury abodes for $20 million and $22 million respectively, and the penthouse residence in lower Manhattan’s landmark Woolworth Building, which has yet to be completed, expected to hit the market with an asking price of $110 million.

Even parking spots aren't coming cheap, with the new development 42 Crosby Street in the city's trendy Soho neighborhood asking for a cool $1 million, more than most apartments.
