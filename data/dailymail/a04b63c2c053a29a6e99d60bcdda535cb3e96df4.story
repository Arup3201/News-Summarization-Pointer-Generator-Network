A New Zealand pensioner has been rescued in California after his vehicle was stuck in the mud during his search for a lost gold mine.

Luckily the 85-year-old, who cannot be named, was saved by activating his New Zealand locator beacon on Friday morning.

He was searching for the gold mine which he first discovered as a boy.

The 85-year-old man's vehicle was stuck in the mud while looking for a California gold mine. He activated his New Zealand locator beacon to call for help on Friday morning

Mike Roberts, a senior search and rescue officer of New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre (RCCNZ), said the beacon's signal was received about 9.30am yesterday.

Mr Roberts said they were able to quickly confirm with the man's son that he was in California.

He then notified the Californian Office of Emergency Services, who found and rescued the man about 30 kilometres east of Paradise, California at 2pm.

Mr Roberts said the man escaped injury although his vehicle was firmly stuck in the mud.

He said the man resumed his search for the mine, about 120 kilometres north of Sacramento, after his vehicle was freed.

His family were notified of the successful search.

Mr Roberts said this incident showed the benefit of carrying a 406 MHz distress beacon, which is legally required to be registered.

'No matter where you are in the world, when a New Zealand-coded beacon is activated the signal will be picked up by both the RCCNZ and the rescue co-ordination agency in the region where the beacon is,' Mr Roberts said.

'As in this case, we work with the other agency to assist in the response and because the beacon was registered we were able to provide useful information about the man.'
