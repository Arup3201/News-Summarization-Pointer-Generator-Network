Prince Philip may be turning 92 years old on Monday, but he was still out in force to support his wife at the Westminster Abbey service to celebrate the 60th anniversary of her Coronation yesterday.

But after later excusing himself from the evening celebrations at Buckingham Palace, speculation has been rife about the state of the Duke of Edinburgh's health.

And now his eldest grandchild, Peter Phillips, has told the public not to be surprised if the Queen and her husband give the 'odd engagement' a miss due to their increasing age.

Speaking on ITVs Daybreak this 
morning, Phillips was asked if his grandfather was OK, after it was 
revealed the elderly Prince was feeling a bit 'under the weather' 
following the events the day before.

He
replied: 'Yes, but you also have got to remember his age, both of their
ages, you know... what they do at their age - they do a lot more than 
most other pensioners of their equivalent age so... if occasionally 
there is the odd engagement cancelled, it shouldn't come as such a 
surprise, given the workload that they do have.'

Mr Phillips, 35, said he was 'hugely 
proud' of his 87-year-old grandmother, describing her as a 'great 
inspiration' to the country.

He said the Abbey service had been 'fantastic', and imbued with a 'real sense of history.'

'She
is a great role model, she always has been. She has been an inspiration
to all of us and it is by us being able to attend these events that we 
show our support and continuing support for her, and also the Duke of 
Edinburgh for everything that they have done and everything that they 
continue to do, not only for this country but also us as a family,' he 
said.

Mr Phillips, whose mother the Princess Royal and sister Zara have both competed in the Olympics, also spoke of his work organising the Global Champions Tour four-day equestrian event starting tomorrow in London, featuring top riders from around the world.

The event, in the International Quarter, adjacent to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London, includes GB gold medalist showjumpers Nick Skelton and Ben Maher.

He said: 'It is about making showjumping more accessible and trying to show that it is one of the original arena sports.'
