Questioning: David Cameron's former communications chief, Andy Coulson, arrives at Govan Police Station in Glasgow after police detain him in London

David Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson will 'vigorously contest' perjury allegations against him if they are ever brought to trial, his lawyer said today.

Mr Coulson, 44, was arrested and 
charged by Strathclyde Police last night over allegations he lied on oath during 
the perjury trial of disgraced Scottish socialist politician Tommy 
Sheridan in 2010.

The dramatic development is acutely 
embarrassing for the Prime Minister whose controversial decision to 
bring the former News of the World editor into Downing Street has 
already raised serious questions about his judgement.

Mr Coulson was hired by Mr Cameron 
just months after he was forced to quit the News of the World in 2007 
following the jailing of the paper’s royal editor on phone hacking 
charges. Mr Cameron said he had deserved a ‘second chance’.

Strathclyde Police, which sent 
officers 400 miles to detain Mr Coulson at his South London home 
yesterday, said a report would be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal 
which will decide whether Mr Coulson is to face court proceedings.

Perjury carries a maximum life 
sentence in Scotland although a spokesman for the justice department 
yesterday said three years was a more typical tariff.

Mr Coulson, already on police bail 
after being arrested last July over phone hacking and police bribery 
allegations, was taken into custody following a 6.30am raid.

Yesterday he was 
driven to a police station in Govan, Glasgow, for questioning and then charged.

Today a Crown Office spokesman said there was no legal obligation for him to stay in Scotland, and he returned to his home today.

No date has been set for any court appearance.

Charged: Andy Coulson returns to his South London home today. His lawyer said he will 'vigorously contest' perjury allegations against him if they are ever brought to trial

Alleged perjury: Andy Coulson, right, accompanied by a police officer, was arrested last night

It was in December 2010, while Downing
Street’s top spin doctor, that Mr Coulson told the Sheridan perjury 
trial that he had no knowledge of illegal activities by reporters while 
he was editor of the News of the World.

He also claimed: ‘I don’t accept there was a culture of phone hacking at the News of the World.’

He denied knowing the Sunday red-top 
paid corrupt police officers for tip-offs but it has since been reported
that its parent company, News International, has uncovered emails 
showing payments were made during his reign.

Mr Coulson quit his role as Downing 
Street communications chief in January last year after admitting the 
escalating row over alleged criminal methods used by some News of the 
World reporters – during his time as editor – was making his job 
impossible. Weeks before he stepped down, Mr Coulson gave evidence at 
the perjury trial of former Scottish Socialist Party leader Sheridan.

Trial: Former MSP Tommy Sheridan makes a statement outside his home after the announcement that former News of the World editor Andy Coulson has been detained on suspicion of perjury

Sheridan was awarded £200,000 in 
damages from the News of the World in 2006 after it printed allegations 
he had committed adultery and visited a swingers’ club.

After the court action, the shamed 
politician and his wife Gail were charged with committing perjury during
the case. She was acquitted during the subsequent trial but Mr Sheridan
was convicted in December 2010. He has since been freed.

Mr Coulson was called to give evidence at Sheridan’s trial because he was editor of the News of the World between 2003 and 2007.

It is understood that officers in 
Strathclyde Police liaised closely with Scotland Yard, which is 
investigating Mr Coulson over the phone hacking and corruption claims, 
before detaining him yesterday.

In a bizarre twist, a smiling Mrs 
Sheridan drove past Govan police office after Mr Coulson arrived there 
and waved to photographers.

Speaking outside his home, Sheridan, who maintains his innocence,
said: 'We were led to believe by Mr Coulson and his acolytes at News 
International during my trial and the initial phone-hacking 
investigations that the problem was a rogue reporter. It’s the 
equivalent of a bad apple in the barrel.

'Well, I think we all know now that there is no bad apple in the barrel, what there is is a rotten orchard full of bad apples.

'Fortunately, given the hard work of Operation Rubicon, we now have a start to what will hopefully become criminal charges.'

'I firmly believe that today marks the first in the journey towards the quashing of my conviction, which was unsafe and unsound.'

Sheridan’s solicitor, Gordon Dangerfield, added: 'We have very strong grounds of appeal and will be lodging a full appeal in due course.

'We believe that when the whole truth comes out, the public will be given an entirely new perspective on what the Tommy Sheridan trial was really about. It is safe to say that many people will have their eyes opened for the first time.'

Controversial: Tommy Sheridan and Gail Sheridan shown leaving the Glasgow court in 2010. Sheridan was eventually jailed but his wife was acquitted

Calling for an urgent review of the 
Sheridan conviction, MP Tom Watson said: 'Tommy Sheridan was convicted 
on an 8-6 verdict of a jury in a Scottish court.

'Mr Sheridan lost his liberty and is still the subject of restrictions on his movement.

'If they knew what the police now know, it seems impossible not to conclude that Mr Sheridan would be a free man.

'His conviction should be urgently reviewed.'

Lawyer
Aamer Anwar, who was Sheridan's solicitor during the trial, said: 'In 
July last year I handed over a dossier to Strathclyde Police that 
contained allegations of criminality in relation to mobile phone hacking
and perjury at the High Court.

'At the time I said that nobody was above the law and we expected a rigorous and robust investigation.

'Under
the circumstances, everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence
and it would be inappropriate to comment on Mr Coulson's detention 
today.'

Speaking about Coulson's detention, a spokesman for Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said: 'These are matters properly for the Crown Office and the prosecution authorities.'

The spokesman recalled that Mr Salmond had spoken about the Strathclyde Police investigation into phone hacking in Holyrood earlier this month.

The First Minister told MSPs then: 'At present we have a live police inquiry in Scotland which has up to 40 officers working on it.

'That is a huge commitment of resources by Strathclyde Police.

'I know that because of the inaction in the past of the Metropolitan Police, people are sceptical about police inquiries into these matters, but there is no reason to be sceptical about the inquiry by Strathclyde Police.

'It is a live inquiry, huge resources are being devoted to it and the expectation is that the force will pursue the evidence without fear or favour and produce effective results.'

Mr Salmond also stated: 'At all times the rule of law will be upheld in Scotland.' 

In a statement today, his solicitor Jo Rickards of law firm DLA Piper said: 'Andy Coulson will vigorously contest the perjury allegations made against him yesterday by Strathclyde Police, should they ever result in a trial. We have no further comment at this stage.'
