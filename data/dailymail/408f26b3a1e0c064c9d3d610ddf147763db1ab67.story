A single mother-of-four has had three limbs amputated after a small bite from her pet Shih Tzu left her fighting for her life.

Christine Caron, 49, had both her legs and an arm amputated after her mixed breed called Buster gave her a small bite on May 22. She brushed off the injury and allowed one of her three other dogs to lick the wound.

Three days later, Ms Caron from Ottawa in Canada, went into septic shock after her wound became infected with Capnocytophaga canimorsus - a bacteria common in dog's saliva.

Injury: Shih Tzu Buster bit his owner in May which is believed to have caused her terrible illness

Ms Caron's extreme reaction to the 
bacteria left doctors fighting to save her life. The medical team at 
Ottawa Hospital were forced to put her into an induced coma for six 
weeks.

The septic shock caused blood flow to be restricted to her limbs and left doctors' with no choice but to amputate.

The 49-year-old told CBCNews: 'When I woke up my legs were black and my arm looked sort of mummified.'

Doctors are unsure if the infection spread from the bite or from a dog licking the wound.

To
 make matters worse, Ms Caron, who was a keen runner and gardener before she was 
struck down by the rare infection, does not have health insurance.

Her 
family have set up a fundraising page to help pay for her prosthetics.

The family has raised $13,000 so far - but will need around $100,000 to pay for medical bills and renovations to her home.

Ms Caron is awaiting surgery for skin grafts on her right hand which she lost movement in but is hoping will recover.

She is expected to spend another six months at the rehab center.

The 49-year-old's four dogs are believed to be being looked after by family while she is in hospital. 

The mother-of-four has shown incredible spirit following the rare infection, saying that she wants to live for her four children and that she will keep fighting because they need her.

She also warned others that if they feel unwell following a dog bite, to have it checked out by the doctor.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is common in the saliva of both dogs and cats. It is normally not seriously harmful to healthy adults.  

It has been estimated that 1million Americans are bitten by dogs every year with chance of infection from canines varying between 3 and 20 per cent.
