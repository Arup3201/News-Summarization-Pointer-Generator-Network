University of Minnesota alumnus Adam Martin proved older brother knows best when he brought his sister to a Gophers hockey game last month

Adam and his sister Maria were watching his alma mater play Michigan on Valentine's Day when they were hilariously caught on the kiss cam - a common sports tradition where couples are forced to kiss in front of the entire crowd.

A couple of weeks before the game, Adam told Maria that they could be put on kiss cam considering the romantic holiday - but Maria scoffed at the chances they'd end up at the jumbo tron.

Awkward moment: Adam Martin (left) and sister Maria (right) were caught on kiss cam at a University of Minnesota hockey game on February 14

Brother's intuition: Martin had an inking he and Maria would be chosen for kiss cam, so he printed out the sign ahead of time just in case

Still, Adam decided to play it safe and printed out the sign at work before heading over to the hockey arena.

He printed out the arrow according to which seats they would be in and then showed her the sign before the game.

'She thought I was being a  dumb older brother and there's no way we'd end up on kiss cam,' he told the Gophers.

So when the kiss cam started in the third period, Adam whipped out the piece of paper and held it in  his lap while they stared at the first two couples on the big screen.

'And then lo and behold, we were the next
 couple on there, and I lifted up the sign and opened it up and somewhat
 held a straight face for the first couple seconds and then started 
laughing,' he said.

No way: Martin printed the sign off at work and showed it to his sister before the game, but she thought he was just being a 'dumb older brother'

Getting ready: As kiss cam started, Adam whipped out the piece of paper and held it in his lap as he watched the big screen with his sister

It was a laugh shared not only by those in the crowd but everyone who watched it online as well.

Since the video was posted online, it has garned over 13 million views on YouTube.

'I thought it would blow over, and it's gone crazy,' sister Maria told People magazine.

If ever caught on the kiss cam with Adam again, Maria said she would hold up a sign that says: 'Older brothers are so embarrassing'.

Adam on the other hand, hopes he won't find himself next to his sister again.

'The goal is next year not to bring my sister to the Valentine's Day game. Hopefully I get a date out of this,' he said.

'Kiss cam' became a tradition in the early 1980s as a way to entertain the crowd during pauses in baseball games. 

It is now a tradition in a majority of major arena sports in the U.S. and Canada, where the camera 'selects' a couple in the audience who are then shown on the giant screen above the pitch - the Jumbotron.
