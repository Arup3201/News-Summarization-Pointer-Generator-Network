We may be in the middle of a sweltering summer, but industry experts have already predicted the toys that will be flying off the shelves come Christmas.

According to Argos, interactive and digital toys - including the new Furby, Teksta Dog and Disney's Sofia The First Talking Doll - have topped its Christmas list predictions.

Andrea Abbis, chief toy buyer at Argos, said: 'Technology is moving at a rapid rate and as the technological components become smaller it’s much easier for manufacturers to incorporate them into toys.

'Children are also very quick adopters of technology and embrace interactive elements within toys these days.

That said, although digital toys are 
big this year, we still believe that traditional toys have an important 
part to play, and in fact we have toys such as Lego and Monopoly on our 
predictions list this year.'
