It’s the type of encounter that can send panic through a herd, but this fearless impala refused to turn and run after a crocodile popped out of the water in front of it.

At one point the predator’s snout was just inches from the impala's nose, but the bold gazelle didn’t back down as it casually sipped from a watering hole.

Tourist Graham Hewer snapped the jaw-dropping scene as he visited Kruger National Park in South Africa.

The 29-year-old said the imapala simply walked away from the crocodile without giving it a second thought.

The crocodile was close enough to attack the impala, but its would-be prey remained calm and seemed oblivious to the fact that it was at death’s door.

Graham’s series of photos show a herd  sipping from the lake as they keep a watchful eye on a group of much larger crocodiles nearby.

His snaps then show the lone impala drinking from the watering hole, moments before its encounter with the crocodile.

The final photo shows the crocodile alone, with its razor-sharp teeth visible inside its gaping mouth.

Graham, a self-taught photographer from the South African capital of Pretoria, revealed he watched on in suspense, expecting the crocodile to kill the impala almost instantly.

But bizarrely it survived the strange meeting - which he puts down to the croc not feeling hungry.

He said: ‘I got the camera ready just in time as the impala made their way towards the water.

‘One got close to a crocodile laying in the shallow water so I was expecting a straight kill.

‘But the impala and the crocodile just had a face-to-face meeting.

‘All the people who have seen this image are amazed to hear the impala survived this face-off.

’That's what fascinates me about photographing animals - its unpredictable, you never know what they will do.’
