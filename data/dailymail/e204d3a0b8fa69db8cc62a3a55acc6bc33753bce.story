Annie Edwards (pictured) died suddenly after a house party with friends

A 'clever and beautiful' 17-year-old girl has  died in her sleep after a house party with friends.

Annie Edwards was found unconscious after partying with pals in the sleepy village of Ditchling, East Sussex. She died shortly after- just three months before her 18th birthday.

Police are treating the death as 'unexplained' after a post mortem today was unable to establish a cause of death and further tests were requested. 

Her grieving family has paid a sad tribute to their 'perfect' daughter. 

In a statement they said: 'Our wonderful, happy, loving, warm-hearted, clever, mad, beautiful daughter Annie passed away suddenly and unexpectedly on Friday morning.

'She was at a party with close and loving friends, having a wonderful time, and at the end it seems she laid down, went to sleep, and never woke up.

'We have always found it difficult to believe that someone so perfect should choose to spend their life with us.

'It is now impossible to believe we will never see her again.'

Paramedics were called to the house on Friday morning when Annie was found unconscious. Despite their best efforts, the 17-year-old was declared dead at 10.30am. 

Neighbours in the small village said the girl had been at the house for a party with a group of friends on Thursday night. 

The owners of the property were believed to have been away when the party was held. 

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'The first we knew about it was when we came out of the house this morning and there were police cars and ambulances in the road.

'We did not know what was going on and it is normally such a quiet village - you do not expect this sort of thing to happen, it is absolutely tragic.'

Another resident added: 'We did see a man come out of the property looking very distressed, he sat on the tailgate of the ambulance and had his hands behind his head.'

The talented student, from Lewes, had been predicted to get three top grades at A-level in Varndean College, and had received an unconditional offer to study English Language and Classical Literature at Birmingham University.

Annie, who attended Southover Primary and Lewes Priory schools, was a huge music fan. A keen flautist she was set to take her grade 8 flute exam later this year, and had recently begun reviewing CDs for a local music paper.

A post mortem was held today but did not establish the cause of her death.

Further tests have been requested, and an inquest date has not yet been set.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark O'Brien said: 'This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the girl's family and friends at this sad time.'

A date has not yet been set for an inquest into her death.  

Annie was three months short of her 18th birthday and in her second year of sixth form at Varndean College in Brighton, and was on track to get three A grade A-levels before her death
