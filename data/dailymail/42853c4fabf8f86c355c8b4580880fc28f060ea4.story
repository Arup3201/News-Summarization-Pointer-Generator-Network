The New Hampshire man who shot his 9-year-old son to death before taking his own life during supervised visitation at a YWCA office on Sunday had made threats to the boy and his mother before.

An adult supervisor was present when Muni Savyon, 54, of Manchester, took out a handgun and shot 9-year-old Joshua Savyon of Amherst before shooting himself around 10 am.

Muni, a software engineer, sent an email to a friend suggesting he was suicidal before the shootings, said Rabbi Levi Krinsky of Chabad Lubavitch in Manchester. Now investigators say he'd also threatened others.

Dead: Muni Sayvon shot and killed his 9-year-old son Joshua Sunday during a supervised parental visit at a YWCA in Manchester, New Hampshire

‘What would provoke him to take his 
life and his son's life? I don't think anyone can figure that out,’ said
Krinsky, who said Savyon attended synagogue occasionally. ‘My heart 
goes out to the family.’

On 
Sundays, the YWCA is open for supervised child visitation and custody 
exchanges. Krinsky said the man and the boy's mother shared custody of 
the boy after parting ways years ago. The couple's marital status wasn't
clear; Krinsky said the couple were divorced, but law enforcement 
officials said the two were separated.

'He was going through a very, very difficult battle over his son,' Krinsky said. 'He was visibly distraught, so my guess is that’s what led to this.'

Krinsky also said that Savyon was depressed following a visit to Israel for his brother's funeral.

'You can sometimes tell when people have had enough,' Krinsky told the New York Daily News. 'But it’s never justified.'

Law
enforcement officials said the relationship had been contentious at 
times and Muni Savyon had previously threatened to kill himself, his 
son's mother and their son.

According to New Hampshire State Representative Peter Sullivan, Savyon was a political hopeful in the state in years past.

‘Muni
Savyon was my opponent in the special election a few years back,’ 
Sullivan, who easily beat Savyon, wrote on his Facebook Sunday. ‘He was a gracious opponent. I am
utterly stunned at the news concerning this morning's horrific events.’

Response: Police arrived to the scene quickly and in force after 10am Sunday, forming a perimeter

Ellen
Savyon Vig, who was once married to Muni Savyon and had remained 
friends with him after their 1997 divorce, described him as a 
kind-hearted person.

She said he was especially close to his brother and
he loved his son, trying to give him varied experiences.

‘He
was nonviolent. He would try to help anyone he could. He was a really 
nice guy,’ she said from her home in North Billerica, Mass.

Police and emergency services responded at approximately 10:30 a.m. to a report of shots fired inside the YWCA in Manchester, New Hampshire

Savyon
was active in Libertarian causes, Vig said, and was a twice-defeated 
candidate for the New Hampshire Legislature, most recently in February.

Born
in Israel, Savyon was a naturalized citizen who lived in several 
Western states before coming to New England, where he worked as a 
software engineer, Vig said.

Others
were inside the YWCA building when the shots were fired partway through
the one-hour visitation. The counselor who was present at the time 
managed to escape unarmed, officials said.
