The alleged mistress of Yankees boss Brian Cashman appeared in court today facing charges of extorting thousands from the married baseball manager to stop her exposing their affair.

Louise Neathway, 36, who also goes by Meanwell, allegedly extorted $6,000 from Cashman. She claimed the father-of-two, who is facing a divorce, was having an affair with her, got her pregnant then paid for the abortion.

Neathway was also indicted on a second count by the Manhattan court for harassing an ex-boyfriend, Wall Street banker Thomas Walsh.

Harassment: Louise Neathway, 36, is accused of trying to extort thousands of dollars from Yankees boss Brian Cashman with whom she claimed she was having an affair

Mr Walsh had a protection order against Neathway after she bombarded him with text messages in the wake of their split, according to the New York Post.

She is due back in court on April 11 and is currently being held at Rikers on $200,000 bail. 

The case has revealed a long list of embarrassing claims from Neathway, who has a history of harassment, who said she had a lengthy affair with 44-year-old Cashman.

The case took another twist last week when photos emerged that allegedly show Cashman drinking at a bar with the woman he claimed is his stalker - before sneaking out of her apartment the following morning.

Surveillance photos obtained by the Daily News appeared to show the Yankees general manager leaving Louise Neathway’s New York building at 5.41am after the couple spent a night together.

Neathway claimed the pictures of the pair enjoying a meal together at a Manhattan restaurant were captured on January 19 – just twelve days before she was charged with harassing and stalking the Yankees manager.

Shamed: Yankees boss Brian Cashman's wife has filed for a divorce after he was publicly accused of the affair with Neathway

The New York Yankees team has vowed to stand by Cashman as the embarrassing 
stalking case continues to make headlines.

The trove of emails sent to Cashman 
and his lawyer by Neathway, who claims she had an affair with the father-of-two and allegedly blackmailed him for $6,000, were obtained by
the New York Daily News.

Neathway allegedly bombarded Cashman 
with emails and even attached an ultrasound scan of their alleged unborn
to one of the messages.

What Brian Cashman has done to me is 
both incomprehensible and unforgivable,' Neathway reportedly wrote in an email 
sent with the scan on January 29.

Secret meetings: This picture allegedly shows Brian Cashman meeting Louise Neathway in her hallway at 7.31pm on January 19

Having a giggle: This surveillance image seems to show Cashman and Neathway enjoying food and drinks together just twelve days before her arrest

'I am going to the press and 
informaing [sic] them of the preganacy [sic] and the abortion. And 
everything else,' she writes typo littered message, reported the Daily 
News.

'So you can have a 
little gloat at my agony here is my ultra sound picture. . . I guess its
ok for me to just push this aside right? Men!!!'

Neathway,
in a separate email sent a day later, threatened to make Cashman’s life
hell unless he paid for her 'abortion'.

Prosecutors said Neathway harassed Cashman with hundreds of 
text messages, and demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for an 
unspecified medical procedure.

Extra threat: Neathway warned Cashman in her last email that any threats against her would backfire claiming she worked for British intelligence agency MI6

Pregnancy scare: Ms Neathway emailed Mr Cashman a photo of an ultrasound, pictured, telling him to pay for her 'abortion' or she would continue to torment him

She
allegedly threatened to contact the press and his family with claims 
that would hurt his personal relationships and professional standing, 
according to a court complaint.

Cashman made two payments, one for 
$4,000 and another for $2,000. Cashman moved out of the family mansion 
after Meanwell was charged with stalking and harassing him.

Cashman is the latest in a line of men 
who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking 
and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former 
friends claim, according to the Post.

Prior accusations: Cashman is not the first man to accuse her of stalking and making threats

Second sting: Cashman's wife has since filed for divorce requesting joint custody of their two children and share in their $3.7 million Darien mansion with this latest sting being his second affair during their marriage
