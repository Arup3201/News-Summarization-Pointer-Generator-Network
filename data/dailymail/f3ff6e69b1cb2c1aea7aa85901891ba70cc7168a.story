A 65-year-old Pennsylvania woman has admitted to selling hundreds of pounds of marijuana from her home but said she needed the money to raise several grandchildren after her daughter died.

Candace Kelly, of Sarver, was originally charged last fall after authorities found 64lbs of hydroponically grown marijuana and nearly $400,000 in cash at her home in Buffalo Township.

Those charges were withdrawn because of problems with a search warrant. Kelly was charged again in January after a grand jury investigation.

On Wednesday, Mrs Kelly pleaded guilty in Butler County telling a judge she sold as much as 100lbs of marijuana a year for more than four years.

Kelly is also forfeiting $393,000 seized by the state police. 

The married mother and grandmother faces up to 10 years in prison when she is sentenced November 20.

Following her arrest on drug charges in January, a defiant Candace Kelly exited the office of a district judge in Saxonburg flashing the peace sign, CBS Pittsburgh reported.

'Legalize it, man,' Kelly declared. 'If I can make that kind of money, why can’t the rest of Pennsylvania wise up?

'I never got on Welfare, I never drew anything from the system, I raised all my kids on my own. That’s my only crime.”

At the time, the family accused police of conducting the search without a warrant and threatening Kelly's 17-year-old granddaughter with a Taser.
