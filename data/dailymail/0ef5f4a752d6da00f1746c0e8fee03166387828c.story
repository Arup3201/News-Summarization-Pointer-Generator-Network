Aston Villa starlet Jack Grealish says he is proud to be known as a homegrown talent after it transpired his club became the first in the Premier League to own an ALLOTMENT. 

The 19-year-old was posing with carrots, radishes and pumpkins on Villa's lot and was full of praise for the club with their continued efforts in encouraging younger players to make a breakthrough.

Villa have a proven pedigree of bringing through players from their academy into the first team, with Grealish just the latest of a long list to make the grade.

The club have bought an acre of land at the rear of Villa Park in order to grow vegetables for the club's chefs to then feed the players with the fresh produce.

Youngsters at the club will be given the opportunity to become chefs and - as part of their daily routines - are expected to grow vegetables.

And Grealish, who has featured on five occasions for Paul Lambert's side this season, is in full support of the new scheme.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I'm proud people think of me as home-grown talent. It's nice to see the club staying close to its roots with this project.'

Next up for Villa is a trip to QPR on Monday as they look to end their four-match losing run. A win would take Lambert's men to within three points of fourth placed West Ham.
