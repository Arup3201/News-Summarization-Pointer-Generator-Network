Dietmar Hamann believes Wayne Rooney will have to work harder and 'live like a top player' if he wants to be regarded in the same bracket football's elite players.

The former German international, who won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005, thinks that Rooney's work ethic is holding him back.

'You have to live like a top player,' Hamann told Perform. 'If you want to be the best, you have to live like the best.

Skipper: Wayne Rooney was named as Manchester United captain by Louis van Gaal

Determined: Cristiano Ronaldo's hard work has made him one of the best in the world, said Dietmar Hamann

'And if you like to party on the weekends and drink beer or a glass of wine too much that could be negative for your performance and I think that's the big difference between Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.

'Rooney always knocked on the door to be world class but never did the final step. And Ronaldo overtook him because he's obsessed. He's a real hard worker. The way he shoots his free kicks is the result of years of training. That doesn't come overnight.

'As I said, often the really talented players tend to do a little bit less because they can get away with it and the others are not as talented as they are. But if you have the talent, the morale and if work really hard just then you'll become a Ronaldo or a Messi.'

Roney was named Manchester United captain by new manager Louis van Gaal, and Hamann thinks that this is the England striker's last chance to shine.

'Van Gaal made him the captain. He knows that it's his last chance - he is 28 or 29,' Hamann said. 'Rooney needs to perform now, he has three or four years left to play at the highest level. Van Gaal is a coach who gets the best out of players - or he sends them away.

'He made him captain, the relationship seems to be good, and that is good for Manchester United and for Wayne Rooney. I am expecting a lot from him this season, but we have to wait to see whether the team is good enough.'
