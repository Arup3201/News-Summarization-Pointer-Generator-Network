Some 34 per cent of people say they suffer the most allergy symptoms in their bedrooms

It is a place for rest and relaxation, but new research suggests the bedroom is the dirtiest room in the house.

Indeed, British bedrooms are so filthy that 34 per cent of Britons say their bedroom is the room in which they suffer the most allergy symptoms.

And this is little surprise as 17 per cent of people admit to only changing their bed sheets once a month.

A survey of 2,000 Britons revealed 34 per cent sneeze most in their bedrooms, while 33 per cent say their sitting room is the most allergy-inducing room and 18 per cent say they suffer most in their kitchen.

London is the dirtiest place – in the capital 12 per cent of people only change their sheets every two months.

The survey, by Samsung Electronics UK, revealed that the most common household allergies to be triggered by dirty houses are those caused by dust mites, pet hair and mould.

And these allergies are causing 78 per cent of people to start sneezing, 73 per cent to get itchy eyes and 25 per cent to develop skin rashes.

The findings suggest the average Briton needs to undertake some serious spring cleaning as 13 per cent suffer symptoms of allergies up to three times a week while six per cent develop symptoms five times a week.

While the prevalence of household allergens is causing Britons untold trouble, many are fighting back.

Some 17 per cent of people claim to vacuum their carpets every day, while eight per cent even steam their curtains to remove dust.

A Samsung spokesperson commented: ‘With the May bank holiday weekends just around the corner, now is as good a time as any for people to give their homes a good spring clean and make sure they don’t spend any more time than necessary reaching for their tissues as their allergies take hold.

‘However, with a number of products such as vacuum cleaners now being designed with allergy sufferers in mind, it’s important that people don’t suffer in silence and are aware of the help that’s available to them.’
