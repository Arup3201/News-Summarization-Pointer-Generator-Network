Most of us have committed a fashion faux pas as teenagers that we'd rather forget. But for actress Christina Ricci, her past style disasters are plastered all over the internet.

As the child star of films including The Addams Family and Casper, she had to grow up in front of the camera and made some red carpet dress choices she now looks back on in horror.

'I was a
17-year-old fright fest!' she told net-a-porter.com's digital magazine, The Edit, referring to her outfit when she attended the Cannes Film Festival for the first time in 1997.

In style: Christina Ricci wears a Temperley London dress in the fashion shoot for net-a-porter

Former child star: The actress said she became more comfortable in her own skin in her twenties. She wears dress by Valentino and shoes by Jimmy Choo, left, and jacket and skirt by Oscar de La Renta, shoes by Christian Louboutin, right

'I'd dyed my hair blonde for a role 
and I was overweight. But then, I don't know anyone who looks back and 
says, "Oh, you should see what I looked like at 17…'"

She added that at that time she wasn't lent designer gowns to wear so instead she picked her own from Barneys.

But at the age of 33 with her acting career still going strong, she said she's found her style and now has her pick of the best dresses to wear.

In the magazine's shoot with photographer Victor Demarchelier, she models romantic pieces by Alexander McQueen, Oscar de la Renta, Temperley London, Valentino, Alberta Ferretti and Dolce & Gabbana. 

Grown up: Now, left in an Alexander McQueen dress, and in 1997 at the Cannes Film Festival in a gown she bought from Barneys

She said: 'I got smaller and more comfortable with myself. It was a gradual thing. As I got older, I became more like my mother. I began to wear what I wanted to wear.

'I'm finding I don’t want to stick to my rigid rules any more. Now I think, "Well, I’ve never worn those kind of pants before - let’s try them!"' 

Now the actress has to make her biggest style choice of all as she decides what dress to wear when she weds fiancé James Heerdegen.

White wedding: Christina is currently planning her nuptials. She wears an Alberta Ferretti dress, left,  and jacket and skirt by Dolce & Gabbana, right, but hasn't yet revealed who will design her bridal gown

The pair met on the set of TV show Pan Am and Christina said she hasn't turned into a bridezilla over their nuptials.

'I just want everyone to have a nice time and to feel happy,' she said of her wedding day. 'I could have easily gone the other way, where I was controlling every detail, but it’s so unpleasant to be like that. If the flowers aren’t exactly the right shade, then so be it.' 

She remained tight-lipped on who is designing her gown but confirmed it would be white and she hadn't had any creative input.

Fashion faux pas: The actress, with her Ice Storm co-stars, does not look back on her outfit at the Cannes Film Festival with pride

Career spanning the decades: As Wednesday in the Addams Family, left, and recently in TV show Pan Am

She said: 'A reporter asked me about it and I said I was looking at sketches. Somehow that ended up as "Christina’s designing the dress," which I have no intention of doing... My mother wore a baby-blue Betsey Johnson for her wedding. At first, I thought it would be sweet to be a bride in blue, and then I thought, no. It’s the one time, God willing, that I’ll wear a wedding dress, so I’m wearing white.' She added that once she's tied the knot she'd love to start a family.
