The Duchess of Cambridge flashes her new necklace, a gift from her sister Pippa, bearing the names of her husband and her son

It's a gift that allows the Duchess of Cambridge to keep her two Princes close to her heart.

She has been proudly wearing a new necklace that carries a disc engraved with her baby Prince George’s full name – George Alexander Louis – and a heart-shaped charm inscribed with the letter  ‘W’ for her husband William.

And though it is a precious token of love, it is hardly one of the Crown jewels.

Kate’s new necklace is a gift from her sister Pippa which sells for £89 from an online boutique.

The Duchess clearly loves it and has been seen wearing it several times over the past few weeks.

Speculation has been rife as to where it came from and who made  it, and now it has been identified  as being from online boutique  Merci Maman, based in Fulham, West London.

Boutique owner Beatrice de Montille, 37, said she recognised the necklace, which has a third charm of a little boy, as her creation.

She said: ‘After Prince George  was born, we made this gold chain especially for the Duchess and sent it to Pippa to give to her sister as a gift, and she passed it on.’

Miss de Montille, who has been running her boutique for seven years, added: ‘I was so happy to see Kate wearing it.

‘She is easily the most inspirational woman of our generation, as she is very elegant, and comes across as so modest.’

Miss de Montille revealed that Pippa, 30,
 has been a regular customer of Merci Maman for two years and has bought
 a number of bracelets from the store.

While the necklace mainly bears the name of her son in pride of place, it also has a slight addendum in the form of a small gold 'W', representing her husband

In 2012, Pippa even sent a thank-you email to Merci Maman after buying one of their creations.

Miss de Montille said the necklace was the perfect gift as charms with babies’ names are worn by new mothers to symbolise their  love for the newborn.

‘You keep the name of your  baby close to your heart, wherever you go. It is a gift to new mothers, just like a baby is a gift to new mothers.’

The necklace was an small token to the Duchess from her sister Pippa Middleton, who says the has been going to the store where she bought it as a regular for two years

She added that since it emerged that  Kate had worn one of her boutique’s necklaces, interest in the store had soared.

‘We had 25,000 hits [on the website] in just three days, which is  the equivalent of all the traffic we get in December, our busiest month,’ said Miss de Montille.

The Duchess was first spotted wearing the necklace two days after Prince George’s christening, when she went on a shopping trip to the high  street store Zara in Chelsea, West London.

Kate, 32, wore the low- key necklace on top of an every-day-looking floral-patterned white blouse and a cream cardigan.

She also wore a pair of figure-hugging dark-blue jeans and a set of suspended gold earrings that matched the dangling necklace.

The simple charm pendant is a stark contrast to the Duchess’s other recent headline-grabbing necklace choice. 

Two weeks ago at a gala dinner at the National Portrait Gallery – her first public engagement of the year – she wore a Cartier-designed chain featuring 38 diamonds supporting a double-drop diamond pendant.

The priceless piece was lent to Kate by the Queen from her ‘jewel pool’, a separate collection from  the Crown Jewels.
