Big fall: An updated version of Humpty Dumpty have been made more upbeat for children

A new campaign has been launched to save traditional British rhymes and songs amid fears they are dying out.

The push follows sanitised, more upbeat versions of classic nursery rhymes, including Humpty Dumpty, being taught to children.

In one updated version the hero didn't get bumped or bruised at all, but instead 'bungee jumped'.

In another instead of being unable to 'put Humpty together again', the new version claimed all the King's horses and all the King's men 'made Humpty happy again'.

The English Folk and Dance Society is running the new National Lottery funded campaign to save traditional rhymes and songs.

Rachel Elliott, the society's education director, told The Telegraph: 'There can be a risk of people being oversensitive and sanitising these things.

'They have to be contextualised – we don’t want to condone drunkenness by singing about the Drunken Sailor.

'But there was a lot of drunkenness at that time. And I don’t think the song is going to encourage it now.'

The original children's poem:

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.All the King's horses, And all the King's menCouldn't put Humpty together again!

A new sanitised version: 

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.He didn't get bruised,He didn't get bumped,Humpty Dumpty bungee jumped!

The society has warned that in some schools children are more likely to learn eastern European or African songs than English ones.

Some songs have been dropped because they refer to death, disease or war in ways that have been judged as no longer be suitable for children.

The society's new campaign, which has attracted a £585,400 grant, will eventually create theworld’s biggest online collection of English folk music, song and dance manuscripts.

Malcolm Taylor, the society's library director, told The Telegraph: 'The other cultures that you find in schools have more of a sense of tradition than the indigenous white children.

'So they will learn about folk songs from other cultures, from Poland, and Africa – as they should, to engage those people – but you need to correct it by increasing the resources for English songs.'

In 2009 a government funded song book changed the lyrics of What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor? to remove and reference to alcohol or punishment.

The BBC was accused of 'outrageous' political correctness 
in the same year after changing the words to a nursery rhyme on a children's show.

CBeebies programme Something Special altered the words to Humpty Dumpty and gave it a more cheerful ending.

Instead of being unable to 'put Humpty together again', the new 
version claimed all the King's horses and all the King's men 'made 
Humpty happy again'.

The Pricklie Bush about a condemned 
woman pleading for someone to save her from the hangman is among the 
songs the society hopes to revive.

The project will involve primary and secondary schools, with workshops for teachers to encourage singing. It will also provide online teaching materials, lyrics and music.

Katy Spicer, the society's chief executive, said: 'This project that will enable people from across the world to access English folk music, songs and dances.

'It will preserve the original collections for generations to come.'
