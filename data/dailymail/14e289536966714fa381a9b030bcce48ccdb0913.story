These beautiful pictures of Christmas prayers and glowing nativity scenes hide a much darker reality.

Hundreds of Iraqi Christians, who now occupy these makeshift tents in Erbil, were forced to abandon their homes to escape the wrath of Islamic State fighters.

They are safe from immediate danger in this camp built around the Mazar Mar Eillia Catholic Church in Ankawa.

But dropping temperatures pose a serious threat to those who hurriedly left their homes without their possessions or winter clothes.

Eerie: A beautifully decorated Christmas tree and nativity scene provide a centre-piece for the sadness around them

Pray: The children who inhabit this camp, built around a Catholic Church in Erbil, wish simply to return home

Innocence lost: This make-shift existence has become their reality - where they live and where they play

Safe: They are safe from immediate danger on the grounds of the Mazar Mar Eillia Catholic Church, but dropping temperatures in the camp pose a new threat

Christmas spirit: But they've refused to let danger - imminent or otherwise - dampen their festive spirit

Life goes on: Nor have they let it hinder their education. Their lessons continue in a make-shift tent on the Church grounds

Christmas prayers: At night, they gather with their families around a candle-lit shrine in their new home

Sacrifice: Almost a million of them (internally displaced Iraqis) will celebrate Christmas in these temporary camps

Temporary home: And nearly half of those will be spending the winter period in the Kurdish region of Northern Iraq

Saturated: Over 250,000 Syrian refugees had already settled in the autonomous region when Islamic State began advancing further into Iraq in June

Keeping the faith: It has massively strained the resources in the autonomous region which is, for now, safe from ISIS

New wave: But with the fighting set to continue, it could be a matter of time before the population reaches breaking point

Over 250,000 Syrian refugees had already settled in the autonomous Kurdish region in Northern Iraq when Islamic State extremist began to advance further into Iraq in June. Since then, another one and a half million displaced refugees have flocked to the area. 

Purpose-built camps have been built for many but the sheer number of evacuees means thousands of families have to settle in unfinished buildings which offer little or no warmth, and no realistic prospect of returning home.

Over three million Iraqi people have been displaced from their homes and nearly two million of them have relocated inside the country, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. 

Their movement is almost entirely a result of the fighting taking place between the Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters against Islamic State extremists.

Reality: Iraqi refugees have to queue to receive their food parcels from St Joseph's Catherdral on the outskirts of Ankawa

Hungry: The men, women and children who travel to this food distribution centre are completely reliant on the aid organisations supplying it

Queuing: Hundreds of them will wait their turn until they can finally pick up the food their families need to survive

Survival: They'll haul their food parcels back to their refugee camp in Erbil to continue their day-to-day existence

New life: These food parcels are vital in keeping these families alive but the dropping temperatures pose another serious threat

It's thought that almost half of all internally displaced Iraqi's have fled to towns in Kurdistan, which is putting huge pressure on the region.

The United Nations announced the situation there as a level-three emergency - their highest classification of a humanitarian crisis.

Nations around the world have expressed their commitment to help the refugee crisis in Iraq and Syria.

On Tuesday,the United Nations refugee agency reported that 28 nations have pledged to take in more than 100,000 people who've been uprooted by civil war in Syria.

Entertainment: They hurriedly fled from their homes to avoid capture, or worse, at the hands of Islamic State. Some pass the time through music

Lunch time: Others prepare meals for their families as they would have done back in their homes

Family portrait: Others seem happy enough to be together, despite the desperate situation they find themselves in

Accommodation: Purpose-built camps were built for thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting in Iraq and Syria

Quick fix: But the sheer number of evacuees means thousands have to settle in unfinished buildings which offer little to no warmth

Prayer: What's worse is there is no realistic prospect of them ever returning home

The United States are currently considering applications to resettle 9,000 of them. As it stands, only around 300 refugees have been housed in the country.

The humanitarian organisation, Samaritan's Purse, airlifted tens of thousands of gift packages to camps like this in Erbil on Wednesday.

People from the United States, Canada and UK combined to fill 60,000 shoe-boxes with small gifts and 'uplifting messages', according to the Christian Post.

Of the two million people displaced within Iraq, nearly half have fled to safety in Kurdistan, putting huge pressure on the region’s resources, which has led the United Nations to designate the situation as a level-three emergency, the highest classification of a humanitarian crisis.
