The way we walk is unique when compared to our closest living relatives, the ape.

But scientists are not sure when our skeleton evolved to create this distinction, which is one of the questions driving the study of human evolution today.

Now, researchers believe the answer could lie in our big toes.

Scientists have developed a new method of analysing long bones, such as the hallucal metatarsal - the shaft of the foot bone that links to the big toe - in order to study differences between the feet of humans and apes. The method shows structural differences in different colours, as shown above

An interdisciplinary team led by scientists at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, has combined visualisation techniques, engineering principles and statistical analysis into a  new way of analysing the structure of long bones.

They used it to document foot differences between humans and apes, so that variations were highlighted in a rainbow of colours.

This work will be the starting point for future studies, which could investigate how far back in our evolutionary history the modern human pattern of bone structure in the hallucal metatarsal – the shaft of the foot bone that’s connected to the big toe - emerged. 

Scientists are not sure when our skeleton evolved to create our unique walk, but they believe the answer could lie in our big toes, which we use in the propulsive phase of walking, unlike apes which use it to climb and grasp.

Podiatrist Christopher Hunt claims that the condition of our feet can indicate health problems.

They are composed of 26 major bones and joints and the way humans walk depends on the way they move in relation to each other.

Beacuse of this, flat feet can indicate curvature of the spine and distorted toes can signify rheumatoid-arthritis later in life.

'A slow pulse can signify poor circulation and, for example, rolling ankles - a condition where ankles roll inwards - can show incorrect posture, which can lead to severe back pain,' he said.

Returning red ulcers could indicate diabetes, which affects 1.4 million people in Britain, while discoloured feet could hint at circulatory problems.

As well as offering crucial evolutionary insights into the timing and appearance of modern human gait, they believe the method will advance the study of bone biology in hominin fossils.

They focused on the hallucal metatarsal in groups of modern humans, gorillas and chimpanzees, because the big toe, or hallux, plays a pivotal role during the propulsive phase of walking and running in humans.

In other living apes, the big toe is more thumb-like so it can be used for grasping and climbing.

Their method, which is described in the journal Plos One, allowed them to detect differences in the shape and size of the bone in the modern species, by creating images from CT scans to make a ‘colour map’ where different qualities and properties of the bone are shown in different colours.

Dr Kristian Carlson explained: ‘This study is an exemplar proof-of-principle analysis for a technique that can advance the general fields of bone biology and functional morphology by introducing a powerful new means of analysing long bone shafts, particularly their structural properties.

‘In our first study, we have documented exciting structural differences between humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, some of which were predictable based on their gait differences.

‘The unexpected structural differences we observed are equally intriguing. We are eager now to begin examining how far back in evolutionary time these differences can be traced.
