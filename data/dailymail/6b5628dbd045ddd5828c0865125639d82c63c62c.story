New inquiry: Shane Virmani, 28, drowned during a party at a hotel pool in Crete this summer

A man who died after drunkenly falling into a pool during a lads holiday, may have been dragged in, it was revealed today.

Shane Virmani, 26, who was not able to swim, was found drowned in a hotel swimming pool in Malia, Crete and it was first believed he had fallen in during an alcohol-fuelled party.

However CCTV footage has emerged showing the supermarket worker from Romford, Essex, being pulled off the side of the pool.

His grieving mother is now calling for justice for her son and for the Greek police to re-open the investigation into his death.

Mr Virmani and dozens of fellow holidaymakers were holding an all-night party at a hotel pool on August 6 this year.

Mr Virmani fell into the pool around 6am but his body was not spotted for a further 25 minutes.

Hotel staff desperately tried to revive him, but to no avail.

Prosecutors in Greece are currently studying the film and will decide whether to take legal action.

An inquest in Greece heard that Shane, who had been staying with a group of friends, had drunk only a 'limited quantity' of alcohol.

Three witnesses were interviewed by police after the tragedy, despite there being around 40 people in the pool are at the time of the incident.

Shane’s mother Melanie Virmani, 47, a teaching assistant from Ilford, Essex, said today:

'This feels like a bad dream. I know whoever is responsible will be going through hell, but I won’t rest until I get justice.

'I know it was an accident, but those involved have to deal with the aftermath of that. I feel so angry about what’s happened - that it could have been prevented.'

She added: 'My lawyer got hold of the 
CCTV footage from the Greek police and it is clear either the police did
not view the recording before they got statements from people or they 
did not care because no one was questioned further.'

Tragedy: Mr Virmani was on a lads' holiday in Malia, Crete at the time of the fatal accident

In the days immediately after Shane’s death, an insurance company added to the family’s grief by refusing to pay to have his body brought back to England.

Family and friends were forced to raise nearly £6,000 to have the body repatriated.

The insurance company, AA Travel Insurance, has now refunded the money after hearing about the low levels of alcohol in Shane’s body and viewing the CCTV images.
