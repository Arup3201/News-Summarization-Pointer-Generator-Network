A 19-year-old's boastful posts on Facebook and Instagram about a jewelry inheritance apparently prompted three men to target a Philadelphia home for a robbery, police say.

Detectives say three men wearing ski masks and wielding pistols kicked in the door of a residence in the Somerton neighborhood at around 2:30 a.m. Sunday.

The trio demanded jewelry and other valuables from the 19-year-old resident, detectives said.

Robbery: Police say boastful social media posts about a jewelry inheritance apparently prompted three men to target a Philadelphia home for a robbery

Escape: Police say the suspects escaped through a rear window with a Rolex watch, two gold chains and cellphones

Police say the suspects escaped through a rear window with a Rolex watch, two gold chains and cellphones.

'You just heard a big crash, it was either the gunshot or them breaking the glass,' neighbor Reign Alimenti told WPVI, 'and you heard glass shattering, and then you heard them out front scream like, "Run! Get out of the house!"'

Police say the 19-year-old and four others in the home ranging in age from 17 to 19 weren't hurt.

Neighbor Anthony Montico also spoke to WPVI, saying 'I saw two gentlemen running from an upstairs floor. They apparently jumped out of the second floor window after they held up a bunch of kids or something in the house. '

'I tried to chase 'em down,' Montico said. 'They ran so fast, two officers showed up with their tactical lights and flashed on me and I told them I had a sidearm.

'So of course I'm going to drop to the ground, I put my sidearm down, they asked me to just put my hands on my head until they verified who I was.

Roommate: Ray Farrell, who lives with the victim, has said of the crime 'I think it was a setup' 

Investigation: Police say the suspects mentioned during the robbery that they targeted the resident after seeing his social media posts

Police say the suspects mentioned during the robbery that they targeted the resident after seeing his social media posts about recently inheriting expensive jewelry. 

The robbers left two guns as well as cellphones when they took off, police told Philly.com.  

A roommate of the victim, Ray Farrell, told WPVI 'Thank God I wasn't here. God works in mysterious ways, you know? I'm just glad all my friends are okay, and uh, nobody got hurt.'

'Definitely somebody who was affiliated with him,' Farrell also said 'It had to be. It had to be either one of his friends or friends of a friend. I think it was a setup.'

The suspects remain on the lam.
