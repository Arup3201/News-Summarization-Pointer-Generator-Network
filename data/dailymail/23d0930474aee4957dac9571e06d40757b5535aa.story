A spitfire enthusiast has spent 28 years building a life-size version of the famous fighter plane from scratch.

Terry Arlow, 56, built the 'perfect' replica of a Spitfire Mk. IX, the same one flown by his friend Tony Cooper during World War Two, despite having no engineering skills, after landing on a plan for the aircraft.

He was inspired by the 1969 war film Battle of Britain when a youngster. But it took eight years alone to secure the plans from the RAF museum in Hendon.

Replica: Spitfire enthusiast Terry Arlow spent 28 years building the life-size version of the Spitfire Mk. IX

Impressive: Mr Arlow hand-crafted the plane from aluminium and spare parts from other Spitfires

Finished product: Mr Arlow said his life has 'revolved around the project' since he took it up 28 years ago

In 1990, Mr Arlow set about building the famous fighter and scoured Europe for parts.

With the help of his family, father-of-four Mr Arlow hand-crafted the plane from aluminium and spare parts salvaged from other Spitfires.

Mr Arlow, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, said: 'It was like a jigsaw puzzle. I had to make all the parts from bare materials and then piece them together.

'It has literally taken tens of thousands of hours to make. It has been non-stop really over the 28 years.

'My life has revolved around the project. You're never away from it. Even in my spare time I'd be studying books and doing research to make sure it looked perfect.'

Mr Arlow used aluminium to hand craft each individual part - including the fuselage, wings and tail - while sourcing original parts for the cockpit and detail.

Detail: Former RAF pilot Mr Cooper (right) was amazed by the level of detail on the finished article

Original: WWII pilot Tony Cooper in the Spitfire, registration number MK 805, which is what the life size replica is based on

Pilot: Mr Cooper said, 'It is wonderful to think Terry spent 28 years of his life building such a perfect replica'

The finished article - completed in 
2010 - was so spot on, friend and former RAF pilot Tony Cooper was 
amazed by the level of detail.

Mr
Cooper flew the Spitfire Mr Arlow based his model on, which had the registration number MK 805, on 38 operational missions during 
WWII.

During his time in the RAF Mr Cooper, who is now 97, served with the 64 Fighter Squadron and was stationed at Harrowbeer

The Spitfire MK 805 became the personal aeroplane of F/Lt. Cooper and inscribed 'Peter John III', as it was the third Spitfire to carry the name of his son who was born two months before it entered service on July 5, 1944.

Paint job: The wings are spray painted in Mr Arlow's workshop in Suffolk

Ongoing work: The wings are prepared to be spray painted as the aircraft is put together

Preparation: Mr Arlow said the wings were the trickiest part of the plane to build as they are elliptical

Plane parts: A section of the wing, before it was painted in its distinctive colours

Construction: The wing of the Spitfire is bolted together as the plane is pieced together

Mr Cooper flew the plane a total of 71 times, of which 38 were operational missions. The Mk. IX replaced the Mk. V from June 1942

Speaking about Mr Arlow's replica, he said: 'It is absolutely tremendous. It looks just like the real 
thing.

'It is wonderful to think Terry spent 28 years of his life 
building such a perfect replica.'

There were, however, moments when even Mr Arlow wasn't sure the build would ever be completed.

Mr Arlow, who had help from his family including son Stephen who sprayed the aircraft, added: 'There was definitely a sense of relief when I completed it after all those years.

'There were times, even two to three years before the end, that I wondered whether I would get there.

'It was only through sheer determination that I kept going.

Finished version: How the wings looked after the impressive painting effort

Streamline: The fuselage of the Spitfire is bolted together in Mr Arlow's workshop

Getting down to work: The plane really begins to look like the original Spitfire as its wings and fuselage are spray painted

Nearing completion: Mr Arlow, who had help from his family including son Stephen, who sprayed the aircraft, said there was a 'sense of relief' when he finished the project

Difficult: Mr Arlow said, 'There were times, even two to three years before the end, that I wondered whether I would get there'

'The wings were the trickiest to build 
because they are elliptical. Even though it is not a flier I still 
wanted it all to be spot on so took my time getting everything right.'

Mr Arlow now runs a business called Simply Spitfire, hiring out his eye-catching plane to war-themed movies, TV shows and events.

And he insists that you couldn't put a price on his life-size Spitfire.

Mr Arlow, who stores the plane locally to where he lives, said: 'The first question I always get asked is what it is worth - but to me its priceless.

'It is always what someone is willing to pay for it.'

In demand: Mr Arlow now hires out the finished Spitfire for movies, TV shows and events. It is pictured here on the set of a WWII-themed TV show
