An off-duty New York narcotics agent went on a week-long drinking rampage — and went on to allegedly shoot two friends during yet another boozy night, a report claims.

Victor Zambrano Jr., 49, had just left a bar on Manhattan's Upper West Side about 9 pm Friday when one of his two pals — who was concerned about his level of intoxication — asked to see his gun, the New York Daily News reported.

Zambrano, an enforcement agent at the New York State Bureau of Narcotics, handed over the .40-caliber weapon to 31-year-old friend Nichola Davidson — but quickly demanded it back, according to the Daily News.

The two allegedly began to struggle and the weapon fired off, striking Davidson on the foot and her 42-year-old boyfriend, Sydney Bernard-Whitehead, on his right calf, according to the Daily News.

Plainclothes officers quickly surrounded Zambrano and had a minutes-long standoff before one of the cops knocked the gun out of his hand and tackled him, the Daily News reported.

The shooting victims were transported to a local hospital with minor injuries and released shortly after.

A report in the New York Post claims Zambrano had been on a 'week-long bender' before the Friday shooting.

'Last week, he started to drink,' neighbor Felipe Jaramillo told the Post. 'I saw him drunk on Wednesday. He was walking by the church on 82nd Street, and I said "Hi."'

'He’s been drinking every day,' another neighbor told the Post.

Zambrano was briefly taken to a local hospital complaining of chest pains on Saturday before being arraigned  on charges of assault, criminal possession of a weapon, resisting arrest and reckless endangerment, according to CBS New York.

Police are still investigating if the shooting was accidental.

'He got drunk and did something stupid,' son Vic Zambrano III, 22, told the Daily News. 'It just escalated. It could easily have been prevented.'

'Same old s---, different day,' the son added, according to the newspaper.
