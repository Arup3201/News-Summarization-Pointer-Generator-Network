More than 80 per cent of British voters do not believe that David Cameron can handle the Iraq crisis from his holiday beach.

The Prime Minister made a flying 19-hour return visit to Downing Street following the murder of American journalist James Foley before going back to the southwest.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Wherever I am in the world I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry.’ However, he has also admitted that his phone reception in Cornwall is very poor.

However, only 18 per cent of voters in a Sunday Mirror/ComRes poll have faith that Mr Cameron can handle a crisis via smartphone.

In addition, 55 per cent of people polled believe that unless checked Islamic State will provide a direct threat to British soil.

Forty per cent of people think that Britain should intervene in foreign countries in case of humanitarian emergencies.

Earlier this week, Mr Cameron condemned the killing of Mr Foley as a 'barbaric and brutal act... without any justification'.

Just 19 hours later however Number 10 announced that the Prime Minister was on his way back to Cornwall to join his third family holiday of the year - his fifteenth since becoming Prime Minister.

Mr Cameron took to the water in a three quarter-length wet suit and on a brightly-coloured bodyboard after hiring boards from a local trader.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Wherever I am in the world I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry.’ However, he has also admitted that his phone reception in Cornwall is very poor

An onlooker said: 'He seemed pretty relaxed and having a good time by himself.

'He didn't do any real surfing - the conditions weren't really there for it - but he had a go on the body board a couple of times. 

Labour MP Ann Clwyd, the former British human rights envoy to Iraq, was equally furious about Mr Cameron's decision to return to his holiday in Britain.

She said: ‘I just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough.

'If he is serious about the threat to Britain, as he says he is and as he ought to be, then he should not be pushing off on holiday. He should be recalling MPs to Parliament so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response.'
