Plastic surgeons have developed a stem cell treatment to overcome the one remaining giveaway of a woman’s true age – her crinkly hands.

It will solve the problem of ‘Madge mitts’ – named after the singer Madonna who has otherwise held back time but whose veiny hands betray her true 55 years.

While diet, exercise and face lifts mean many women look much younger than their age, hands are still a sure giveaway.

The new treatment breaks down fat taken from the patient’s body to produce a solution of stem cells.

The liquid is then injected just below the surface of the skin and these stem cells transform into skin cells over weeks and months, thickening and smoothing the skin.

Doctors behind the treatment, which is referred to as nanofat grafting, are also using it to reduce dark circles under the eyes, caused by thinning skin, and to rejuvenate the neck and breast area.

Dr Alexis Verpaele and colleagues at the Coupure Centre in Ghent, Belgium, have carried out nanofat injections on 100 patients, of which about ten were into patients’ hands.

Dr Verpaele said: ‘Injecting nanofat improves the skin’s quality. It makes it smoother and corrects imperfections to reverse the crepey and wrinkly texture that affects women from their late 40s and 50s.’

Skin naturally thins with age, he said, making muscle, bone and veins more visible. The skin itself also becomes more textured as it loses elasticity. Hands exhibit these signs very clearly because they have little fat to begin with.

He added: ‘Hands have been a little bit overlooked for a long time by plastic surgeons. We are finding there is huge demand for this.’

Dr Verpaele’s hand treatments, which cost between £1,300 and £1,700, include nanofat as well as injections of slightly larger ‘micro fat’, to plump up lost fat volume, and lasering to get rid of small dark liver spots.

These ‘micro fat’ injections, of fat harvested from the patient’s thighs, buttocks or stomach with very fine needles, have already been used in plastic surgery for some time.

The former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, Fazel Fatah, has said there is no evidence that Dr Verpaele’s stem cell method is superior to existing  fat-injection treatments.

But leading American surgeon Dr James Stuzin said results suggested nanofat could be ‘truly regenerative’.
