Two Florida parents were arrested on Tuesday after police found them living in a criminally filthy home with their two young children, 15 pit bulls, and hundreds of feeding insects.

The children of Dutsin Deck, 28, and Katie Renner, 27, aged one and a half years and five years were placed with a relative as the Florida Department of Children and Families investigates their case.

The home on the 5600 block of Viburnum Court in Polk City showed signs of dangerous neglect as it was covered in animal feces from 15 different pit bulls and was infested with creepy crawlers.

15 pit bulls, eight of whom were puppies were taken away by Animal Control after being discovered in an unhealthy habitat

Police went to visit the home after Renner accused Deck of domestic violence earlier that day at the gas station, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

When authorities arrived at the grotesque house they saw seven adult pit bulls and eight pit bull puppies both inside and outside the home.

Dog feces festered next to children's toys and carpets in the home were soaked in urine.

Flies and cockroaches gathered around the baby's highchair to eat stale food and congregated to feast on the crumbs which were scattered over piles of dirty dishes.

Police also found marijuana and a bong sitting on a table in the living room both of which were within reach of young children.

Renner told police that she believed the condition of her home was acceptable for children and that they were 'happy.'

'She told deputies if people don't like her house then they don't need to come over,' the Polk County Sheriff's Office said in a report yesterday.

'She admitted to the marijuana being in the home and admitted to smoking marijuana, saying she believed marijuana should be legal,' continued the report.

Animal Control officers were also brought in to remove the 15 dogs since they were exposed to intense heat and didn't have access to water.

'Two pit-bull dogs were locked in a cage with no overhead cover to protect them from the direct sunlight and intense heat,'Â  the report said.

'There was no access to fresh or clean water.'

Both Deck and Renner face a laundry list of charges.

Deck was charged with child neglect, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia animal cruelty, battery on a law enforcement officer and tampering with evidence.

Renner faces charges for child neglect, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, animal cruelty,battery on a law enforcement officer and tampering with evidence.

'These two are in jail where they belong,' said Sheriff Grady Judd in a statement.

'It is one thing if you want to sit around, smoke pot, and live in nasty conditions as an adult. But it is an entirely different thing if you do those things while neglecting the basic needs of children and animals under your care,' he concluded.

The residence also housed 15 pit bulls eight of whom were puppies in extreme heat and with limited access to food and water

Not only were children's toys scattered among dirty laundry and dog feces, marijuana was also allegedly found within reach of the children living in the home

An insect infestation plagued almost every corner of the filthy Florida home
