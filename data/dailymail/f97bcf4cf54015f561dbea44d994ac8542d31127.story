Joachim Low has been told his job as manager of Germany is safe - even if Algeria cause an upset in the last 16 of the World Cup.

Germany are overwhelming favourites to see off Algeria on Monday to progress to the quarter-final, but the German Football Association opted to put Low's mind at ease.

Low extended his contract to 2016 before travelling to Brazil and no conditions were attached.

Germany, under Low, have made it to the semi-final three times and their FA expect the boss to deliver a fourth.

Anything less will be deemed a failure.

'We still have the clear intention of carrying on with him,' German FA president Wolfgang Niersbach told Germany's Stern magazine.

'There are no clauses in his contract which state that it depends on certain results.'

There aren't many that expect Algeria to progress, and a quarter-final tie with France or Nigeria will also see Germany favoured to make it to the final four.

'The way we have developed has been fantastic,' said Niersbach.

'Previously, we were getting recognition for our results while now we're getting a great degree of recognition for our style of play.'

Safe: Germany are firm favourites to beat Algeria but Low won't want to risk infuriating the FA regardless

Chase: Muller is racing for the golden boot having scored four goals - one behind Colombia's James Rodriguez

Promise: The German FA say they 'have the clear intention of carrying on with' Low
