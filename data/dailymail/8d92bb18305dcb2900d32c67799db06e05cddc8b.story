Rail passengers face inflation-busting fare rises of up to 11 per cent in the New Year, it emerged yesterday.

Commuter groups were furious that while the average rise from January 2 will be 5.9 per cent, some passengers could see fares go up by far more.

Train companies revealed the fares a day after the Office of Rail Regulation took enforcement action against Network Rail for poor and worsening punctuality, with one in eight trains (13 per cent) running late.

Costs: Commuters at Victoria Station, London. The price of train travel is set to rise by an average 5.9 per cent - higher than the Retail Price Index rate of inflation

Imminent fare rises didn't deter the Queen who alights at King's Lynn yesterday after taking the 10.45am First Capital Connect train from King's Cross to Sandringham for Christmas

The blow to passengers also comes 
amid complaints of overcrowding and just before the Christmas getaway in
which passengers face replacement bus services to cover engineering 
works.

Sophie Allain, of 
the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‘Another New Year approaches 
and yet another round of eye-watering train fare hikes looms. We still 
have the highest fares in Europe.’

Manuel
Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport union, said: ‘Once again we have 
the private train operators defying all economic logic and increasing 
the squeeze on passengers during a recession.’

The
union accused train companies of trying to ‘bury bad news’ by hiding 
big fare rises among the millions that had been announced. It said a 
return saver with Virgin from Euston to Nuneaton would rise 9.2 per cent
from £35.80 to £39.10.

Labour’s transport spokesman Maria Eagle said many tickets would see a similar percentage rise.

The
5.9 per cent average rise covers all rail fares – both regulated and 
unregulated. Regulated fares, which include season tickets and make up 
around 40 per cent of the total, will rise by an average of 6 per cent.

Condemnation: Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT, left, said rail 
operators were 'laughing all the way to the bank', while Maria Eagle, 
the shadow transport secretary, right, accused the Government - which has a policy of raising train fares - of being out of
touch with the difficulties faced by hard pressed commuters

Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said the money raised will be reinvested in the rail network

But
train companies are allowed to add another 5 per cent – making 11 per 
cent in total – provided other fares are reduced to keep the average at 6
per cent. On unregulated fares, which make up around 60 per cent of the
total, there is no limit on rises that can be made.

Even
around the average 6 per cent increase, a commuter from Swindon to 
London will still see the cost of an annual season ticket rise by £424 
to £7,448.

Those heading for London from Northampton will see annual 
season tickets go up 6.92 per cent to £4,756. Next month’s rise also 
takes the price of an annual season ticket to London above £4,000 for 
the first time at a number of towns, including Hastings, Eastbourne and 
Bedford. But the Hastings rise (4.95 per cent) and the Eastbourne 
increase (4.97 per cent) are, at least, below the national average.

The
boss of the group representing train companies denied being less than 
open about the detail of the increases. Michael Roberts, chief executive
of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘Money raised 
through fares helps pay for new trains, faster services and better 
stations.

‘Clearly we 
understand these are really difficult times financially for a lot of 
people. But actually people are voting with their feet and their wallets
increasingly to travel by train. Last year we carried an extra hundred 
million passengers.’

The 
basic 6 per cent rise in regulated fares is set by the Government and is
based on the July 2011 RPI inflation figure plus 1 per cent.

Rail union TSSA accused Atoc, which announced the rises today, of trying to 'bury bad news' by giving 'only the barest details' of the overall increase.

In the past Atoc has given details of fare rises for each train company rather than just giving an overall average figure for all tickets.

Today, Atoc in its press release merely referred those wanting to learn about individual fare rises to the National Rail Enquiries website.

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA transport union, said: 'Once again we have the private train operators defying all economic logic and increasing the squeeze n passengers during a recession.

'All other big companies, like Tesco and Sainsbury's, actually cut prices during the downturn. Even the BBC is freezing its licence fee.

'But they carry on with their inflation-plus rises, which will get even worse in 2013 and 2014 when passengers face RPI plus 3 per cent increases.' 

Passengers are suffering from a lack of healthy rivalry between bus companies, competition chiefs concluded today.

The Competition Commission said there were about 1,245 bus companies in England, Scotland and Wales, carrying 2.9 billion passengers a year.

But the five largest operators (Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach) carried 70 per cent of those passengers.

The commission also found that head-to-head competition between operators was uncommon and that, on average, the largest operator in an urban area ran 69 per cent of local bus services.

Jeremy Peat, chairman of the CC's local bus market investigation group, said competition had 'stagnated' and operators face little challenge for customers.

He went on: 'On the occasions when there are outbreaks of rivalry, they don't tend to last and passengers are quickly returned to ... the status quo.'

Ministers
had originally planned to increase this annual fare cap from RPI plus 1
per cent to RPI plus 3 per cent. But this decision was reversed by 
Chancellor George Osborne in last month’s autumn statement.

However, the Government still intends that the higher RPI plus 3 per cent formula will apply in January 2013 and January 2014.

Inflation-busting
rail fare rises were begun under Labour to switch the burden of paying 
for the railways away from the taxpayer towards the passenger.
