A painting by New York abstract artist Barnett Newman sold for a record $43.8 million at Sotheby's last night.

Onement Vi, a 8.5ft by 10ft dark blue canvas with Newman's distinctive 'zip' running through the centre, was painted in 1953.

It is the last of six pieces the artist created for his Onement series. Four of the oil on canvas paintings are now owned by museums.

The piece had been expected to sell for between $30 million and $40 million at the auction, which was held in New York.

The painting has previously been exhibited at galleries including the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.

However, it has always been owned privately. The seller had bought the piece for a private collection in 2000.

Until yesterday, Onement V held the previous auction record for Newman. It sold for $22.4 million last year.

Born in 1905, the abstract expressionist Newman was said to have influenced other artists including Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Frank Stella.

While he forged his career in the art world, Newman, who died in 1970, worked for his father's company, making men's clothes.

In its catalogue notes for the painting, Sotheby's says: 'Newman overwhelms and seduces the viewer with the totality of its sensual, cascading washes of vibrant blue coexisting with Newman’s vertical “Sign” of the human presence, his iconic and revolutionary “zip”.'

In his later years the artist, praised by Sotheby's as being 'among the most independent and courageous artists of the Twentieth Century', produced a series of steel sculptures.

According to Bloomberg, at least five people bid for Onement VI. The eventual buyer was a phone bidder.
