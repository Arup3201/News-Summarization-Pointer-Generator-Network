A cyclist was killed after he was hit by two cars within 15 minutes because both drivers were 'blinded' by the sun, a court heard.

Stan Coates, 55, was injured but alive and conscious after he was hit by Michael Elton's black Corsa on Burdon Lane in Sunderland.

He was able to speak to the emergency services about his sore wrist and knee as he sat by the roadside waiting for an ambulance in October 2012. 

Michael Elton, 25, (left) and Edward Peverley, 21, (right) both denied causing death by careless driving at Newcastle Crown Court after their cars ploughed into cyclist Stan Coates, 55, within 15 minutes of each other 

But within minutes of being struck, he was hit by a white Corsa driven by Edward Peverley and dragged along the road, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Mr Coates from West Herrington died in hospital from multiple fractures and injuries in the early hours of the following morning.

Prosecutors claim both drivers were 'blinded' by the sun when they hit Mr Coates and had not taken appropriate steps to make driving in such conditions safe.

Michael Hodson, prosecuting, said: 'The crown's case is they should have slowed down, far below the speed they continued to travel at, you may think to a crawl, with hazard lights on.

'What they should not have down was what both did.'

Investigators estimate Elton may have been travelling at up to 50mph and Peverley at less than 40mph.

Elton, 25, from Durham and Peverley, 21, from Tyne And Wear, both deny causing death by careless driving.

Both drivers stopped at the scene when they realised they had had been in accidents.

The court heard that despite Mr Coates surviving the first collision, prosecutors say both drivers are to blame for his death.

Mr Hodson told jurors: 'Elton's careless driving knocked Mr Coates down into the road, which was the reason why Peverley hit him.

'Mr Elton's careless driving has therefore contributed, in more than a minimal way, to the death of Mr Coates.

'He was driving too fast at the time when he knew he couldn't see the road ahead.

'It is obvious, the Crown say, is it not, that a fatal accident might occur in those circumstances and he is then guilty.

'Peverley was driving too fast when he couldn't see the road ahead.

'If you are sure he was driving carelessly, he has contributed more than slightly to the death and is guilty of causing death by careless driving.'

The trial continues.
