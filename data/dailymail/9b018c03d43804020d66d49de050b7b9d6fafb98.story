'Unpredictable threats': Defence Secretary Michael Fallon urged increased defence spending to ward off countries like Russia

Britain is under pressure to extend a commitment to spend at least 2 per cent of national income on defence as it demands Nato allies boost their investment.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said every member should increase military spending to deal with ‘unpredictable and uncertain threats’, particularly from Russia.

The Prime Minister said Britain was showing leadership by being one of only four of the 28 Nato states to meet the alliance’s spending target.

But critics, including senior Tories, pointed out that the Government has only pledged to maintain that level until the current spending round ends in April 2016. Pressure is growing on David Cameron to enshrine the commitment in legislation for good.

Britain and the United States will also use the Nato summit in Wales to push for a new rapid response force comprising of between 3,000 and 5,000 international troops, which could be deployed within two days if member states face military aggression. 

The organisation is proposing to beef up its presence in eastern Europe following Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea and attempts to destabilise more of Ukraine.

It is also proposing military exercises alongside Ukrainian forces as a warning to Moscow.

France was last night shamed into cancelling plans to sell a multi-billion pound warship to Russia following protests from the US and the UK.

Mr Fallon insisted Nato must ‘toughen up’ to deal with the new threats facing the West.

He said the alliance must sharpen its activities to contend with crises, including ‘almost daily atrocities’ in the Middle East.

The Defence Secretary said the West could either ‘enfeeble’ the transatlantic alliance by allowing defence spending to fall, or ‘revive its spirit’ by boosting investment.

‘Let me be very clear about the UK’s position,’ he said.

‘It’s time now to toughen up so that Nato can deal with the aggression and the threats that we face.

‘That means rapid reaction forces that are worthy of the name, that means better sharing of capability, and it means the first ever public commitment to increase defence spending.

‘That will demonstrate to all those who threaten us that the state of our transatlantic bond is strong.

‘Nato was formed on the basis that Europe would pay her way.

‘Like any insurance policy, defence only pays out when you pay in.’

Colonel Bob Stewart, a Conservative MP who was the commander of Nato forces in Bosnia, said Mr Cameron should put the two per cent spending commitment into law - rather than a separate pledge to legislate for 0.7 per cent of national income going on foreign aid.

Labour MP Thomas Docherty added: ‘It’s typical of the Tories that they are lecturing our European partners about defence when they won’t commit to adequately funding our troops beyond the next financial year.

‘Michael Fallon should be getting his own house in order before trying to tell voters what to do.’

The Government will seek to demonstrate its commitment to defence spending by unveiling a £3.5billion deal for nearly 600 new armoured vehicles, the Army’s largest single order for armoured vehicles for more than 30 years.

Mr Cameron said the UK had the second largest defence budget in Nato and was providing ‘leadership’ on spending within the alliance. Other countries, including Canada, have fiercely resisted calls to increase defence spending above two per cent of GDP.
