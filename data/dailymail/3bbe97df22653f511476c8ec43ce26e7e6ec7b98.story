Peru is undergoing its biggest effort to date in exhuming the victims of its bloody civil war, which took place from 1980 until 2000.

An estimated 70,000 died in the conflicts as local Maoist rebels called the Shining Path, fought against soldiers and paramilitary allies in the hills of the Andes.

A team of forensic anthropologists are currently working in Chungui district in the Andes and expect to remove hundreds of bodies, mostly of women and children who were killed by government troops believing they supported the rebels.

Valentin Casa, a 36-year-old farmer, 
looks on as investigators carefully remove the remains of a hand and two copper
 rings from a mass grave in the village of Huallhua in Chungui.

The
 grave contains the long-buried remains of two women and 13 children, 
and Casa believes the hand the team has just unearth is that of his mother.

Valentin was just nine years old when he was forced to watch as soldiers and 
their paramilitary allies dismembered and killed his mother and other 
women and children left behind by fleeing Shining Path rebels.

Civilians
 suspected of backing the rebels were hunted down and killed. Two weeks 
later, troops and their civilian confederates caught and killed men from
 Casa's village, including his father.

Three
 decades later, this isolated corner of Peru is witnessing the biggest 
exhumation to date of victims of the nation's 1980-2000 internal 
conflict. The worst of its carnage occurred on these hills between the 
Andes ridge and Amazon jungle.

‘Everybody here is traumatized,’ Casa says as he watches the work underway. ‘Whoever says he isn't is lying.’

Authorities
 in the Peruvian capital of Lima have been painfully slow to dispatch teams to dig up 
the dead from a brutal conflict that, according to a 2003 truth 
commission report, claimed an estimated 70,000 lives.

Just over half 
were slain by Maoist-inspired rebels, over a third by security forces, 
the commission found. Human rights activists blame politics, including 
resistance from the military, for the delay in exhuming the bodies. 
Fifty criminal investigations were only launched into the killings in 
2011, said the prosecutor in charge, Gloria Pareja.

In
 November, forensic anthropologists began their work in the Chungui 
district and expect to remove 202 bodies in all - mostly women and 
children. At least 1,384 people were killed in Chungui, an area 
slightly larger than Hong Kong geographically but has only 6,000 
inhabitants.

People there are constantly uncovering bones but very few graves have been exhumed by professionals.

The
 killing fields are an 18-hour walk from the nearest road in a region 
known as ‘Oreja de Perro,’ or Dog's Ear. It is a place where health 
care, schools, police and other state institutions barely exist. There 
are no roads, electricity or phones. The hills are still patrolled by 
Shining Path rebels, and drug traffickers flaunt the state's absence.

There are no roads, electricity or phones in nearly all of the isolated region known as 'Oreja de Perro' - 'The Dog's Ear'

Survivor: Ceferino Casafranca, said to be the oldest survivor of the conflict, rests under the shade of a tree in Huallhua, a village in Chungui, an area where health care, schools, police and other institutions barely exist and where the hills are dominated by Shining Path rebels and drug traffickers

At
 the edge of a shallow pit, Casa provides security for the forensic team
 while armed with a worn Mossberg 500 shotgun. He watches the 
technicians uncover a skull here, a swath of clothing there and finds 
himself overwhelmed by memories.

‘I drank my own urine to survive,’ Casa remembers, having fled into the forest after his mother was killed.

The exhumers gather the diminutive bones of children, 26 found so far in the district, in boxes made to hold sweet bread.

 her husband, the soldiers came for her and her mother.

Her mother was murdered after the soldiers cut her breasts off, the customary way of marking a raped woman.

No
 one has been arrested or prosecuted to date for the crimes in Chungui. The survivors are mostly on 
their own, and villagers say no one has received any mental health 
counseling

The poor conditions in the area were what prompted the poor farmers of Chungui 
to initially welcome the Shining Path before the civil war.

In 1965, other Cuban-inspired 
guerrillas had freed farmers there from grinding servitude, 
assassinating the two powerful ranchers responsible.

The
 Shining Path persuaded farmers to abandon their homes and live in 
forest camps to avoid encounters with soldiers, but their rule soon took a sinister turn.

Wary
 of being discovered, the rebels prohibited people from lighting cooking
 fires, forced women to give birth in caves and killed children who did 
not keep quiet when soldiers neared, said Edilberto Jimenez, an anthropologist who interviewed hundreds of survivors in the 1990s.

Today's
 Shining Path only numbers in the hundreds, taxes the cocaine trade and 
still has a reputation for cultivating local farmers.

Priska
 Palacios, a worker from the German government development agency GIZ, 
said little has changed for poor farmers in Chungui.

‘The
 basic conditions that generated the internal armed conflict - poverty, 
exclusion, discrimination - are exactly the same as they were in 1980,’ 
Palacios said.
