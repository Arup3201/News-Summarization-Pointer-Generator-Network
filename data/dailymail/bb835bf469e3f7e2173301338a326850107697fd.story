Hoshiyama was arrested by Honolulu Police and U.S. Marshals just after 5 a.m. on Tuesday

In October, an Arizona grand jury indicted her and an arrest warrant for Hoshiyama was issued - but she and her family had left the state in August.

Arizona U.S. marshals tracked her to Honolulu, the Marshal's Service said.

She has been booked by Honolulu police pending a court appearance and extradition hearing back to Arizona.

Just weeks ago she bragged on Facebook about getting her teaching certificate for Hawaii. 

The mother-of-two, who is originally from Abington, Massachusetts, posted a photograph of her licence and wrote: 'Yay I'm legit now!'

She also explained that had got a job at a charter school doing half resource and half interventionist. 

The Hawaii Department of Education has said that Voyager Charter School had submitted an application for Hoshiyama to start as a teacher on November 7. 

The application was on hold while the DOE checked on her. According to the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board she has been licensed in the state since October.
