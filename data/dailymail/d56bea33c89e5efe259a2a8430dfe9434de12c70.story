A Northern Territory man has invented his own unique weather-inspired twist on the hipster beard trend and it’s going down a storm in the Top End.

And that's not where his grooming talents end - he's also invented the blowtorch haircut.

'It works well... Your hair is generally shorter than it was before you had the haircut,' Glenn Watt told the Northern Territory News.

The Victorian-born fisherman has been naming and modelling his facial hair on Darwin's seasonal weather patterns, including The Cyclone and The Sou'easter stemming from the dry season’s south easterly winds, for a while and it's starting to catch on.

Fisherman Glenn Watt created this cloud design in his beard as a nod to the NT's stormy wet season

The most striking of all his designs is The Build Up. In a nod to the Territory's unpredictable wet season, he gave his beard a cloudy makeover.

On the ABC’s Tales From The Tinny Facebook page, Mr Watt wrote in response to the comments he received about his beard: ‘Thanks for the support everyone.

‘Sometimes you make sacrifices for art. The dog wouldn't come, the baby cried and the missus packed a bag for me till it was gone.

Mr Watt has also invented the blowtorch haircut - something you should not try at home

‘It's going to be a long hard road for asymmetrical man maintenance enthusiasts but I'm strong. Thanks Rob, Tim and Fadge for encouraging the arts, weather and fishing to come together. The ball is in your court now Dave Krantz.'

Mr Watt’s friend Dave Krantz became a fan of his pal’s unusual facial topiary after spotting it on social media and went on to give himself his very own cyclone inspired beard in 2013.

In an interview with the ABC, Mr Krantz said: ‘His first one was admittedly not great. So I showed him how it was done.’

Next came some cattle inspired designs: Introducing the 'cattle grid' beard

The mates are now trying to outdo each with their designs and admit the competition has been heating up.

Mr Krantz has even gone so far as to branch out from weather inspired designs, turning his skilled hand to creative creations straight out of the ranch.

He developed a three-pronged masterpiece, a nod to the cattle grid.

To create your own beard etchings you will need 10 days of growth – unless you are particularly hairy – plus a steady hand.

Meanwhile, The Bushman’s Haircut, which is in actual fact not a cut at all but involves setting the hair on fire to create a ‘freestyle’ do’ with the help of a blowtorch, is something you should definitely not try at home.

Mr Watt told the Northern Territory News he uses a can of insect repellent and a lighter to rid the head of hair.
