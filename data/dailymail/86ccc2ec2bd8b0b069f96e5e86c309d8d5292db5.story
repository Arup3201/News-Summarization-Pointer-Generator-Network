It was once the place to buy panthers, tigers and camels and even caught the fancy of Ronald Reagan, who rang up to pay for a baby elephant.

But the Harrods Pet Kingdom will soon be no more - to be replaced with a womenswear section.

The London department store's pet section opened in 1917, and rivalled London zoo with a vast array of animals which it sold for more than 50 years until most were outlawed by the 1976 Endangered Species Act.

Barmy: John Rendall paid £3,000 in today's money for Christian the lion cub, which he kept in his Chelsea flat

The playwright Noël Coward was one of its more famous customers, having an alligator bought for him for Christmas in 1951 by the Canadian actress Beatrice Lillie.

And in 1969, Australian backpackers John Rendall and Anthony Bourke bought Christian the lion cub for 250 guineas, or £3,000 in today's money.

Sadly he outlived their flat in nearby Chelsea, and had to be released into the wild in Kenya.

But the most famous purchase from the pet store came in 1967, when future American president Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, rang up to buy a baby elephant called Gertie.

Legend has it the shop worker on the other end of the phone said: 'Would that be African or Indian, sir?'

Less than a decade later, the Endangered Species Act would put a halt to most of the department's more exotic sales.

However, it maintained a good trade in hamsters, rabbits, cats and pedigree dogs until recently.

Mr Rendall told the Evening Standard: 'It was a completely different time and the world has moved on.

'After the Endangered Species Act they couldn’t have a zoo, and the pet shop was no longer a big draw so I understand they have to think of something more profitable but it’s certainly the passing of an era.'

A Harrods spokesman said: 'The Pet Kingdom department will close to make way for further exciting planned developments in our womenswear offering.

'Employees have been informed and Harrods is working with them to find alternative positions in the store where possible.'

The world-famous store was once owned by the outspoken billionaire Mohammed Al Fayed, but was bought out by the Qatari royal family's fund Qatar Holding in 2010 - becoming only the fifth owner since it was founded.
