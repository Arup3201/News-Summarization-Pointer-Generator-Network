Aston Martin will lead the British supercar charge at the Geneva Motor Show next week — just in time for the new UK '15' plate change.

If you have a spare £1.8million tucked away, then the Vulcan, a storming two-seater 'hypercar', could be just the job to blow it on.

And you'll even get special lessons on how to drive it from a professional racer at a bespoke track day.

The name smacks of Star Trek and the delta-winged bomber that once carried Britain's strategic nuclear deterrent. Indeed Aston Martin's HQ at Gaydon, Warwickshire, was formerly an RAF V-bomber base.

Just 24 Vulcans will be built, each exclusively for track use.

Powered by a massive sevenlitre, V12 engine tweaked to produce 800bhp — equivalent to eight Ford Fiestas — expect a top speed in excess of 200mph and 0-60mph in three seconds.

Aston Martin says it is 'almost infinitely flexible' in terms of colour and trim options.

The car will be sold through the firm's VIP sales programme and Q by Aston Martin bespoke personalisation service.

Chief executive Dr Andy Palmer says: 'The Vulcan is a rare and thrilling supercar. We have already received strong interest from customers.' ? 

McLaren's Geneva debut will be its new 675LT variant — a more powerful version of the 650S. The 666 bhp, twin turbo, V8-engined supercar, which accelerates from rest to 62mph in less than three seconds, will have a price tag of around £260,000.

A long-lost TV interview with Soviet spy Guy Burgess, which emerged this week, yields a hitherto unknown and fascinating fact about this louche member of the Cambridge Circle of British traitors, which includes Donald Maclean, Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt.

Exiled in Moscow after his flight from Britain, Burgess talks about his passion for cars, and subscribing to Autocar magazine since the age of nine — even while in Russia.

His choice of car? Any colour as long as it's red, no doubt.

The '15' plate, out tomorrow, is predicted to be good news for the ordinary car buyer, with discounts of up to a third being predicted.

Traditionally, March is the month with most car sales, with around one in five new registrations.

Manufacturers and industry experts are predicting lots of bargains. Motoring website HonestJohn.co.uk says consumers could save thousands as the cost of a new car falls to a four-year low spurred by lower finance, petrol and insurance costs.

Typical interest rates for car finance have dropped by more than 3 per cent over the past four years, deals from High Street lenders have increased dramatically and the cost of borrowing is at an historic low, with the base rate of 0.5 per cent filtering down to car buyers.

Daniel Powell, managing editor of HonestJohn, says: 'March is the best time to buy a new car. But consumers should shop around for the best deals.

'Some dealers will offer as much as 30 per cent off list prices.' Highlights include new models from Ford, Skoda and Volkswagen. This month will also see sales of sports utility vehicles boom with the new Fiat 500X, Land Rover Discovery Sport and Honda CR-V making their debuts.

BMW's stunning i8 plug-in hybrid sports car has been crowned UK Car of the Year for 2015. The nearest challenger was the Citroen C4 Cactus, followed by the Renault Twingo in third.

Competition organiser John Challen says: 'The automotive industry has seen many hybrid models in recent years, but nothing quite like the i8.

'The term game-changer is sometimes over-used when talking about new cars, but in the case of the i8, is totally justified.'

A sleek new 200mph baby Bentley fit for a 21st-century James Bond is roaring this way. The wraps are set to come off the company's two-seater Aston Martin rival on Monday on the eve of next week's Geneva Motor Show.

But details of the top-secret prototype coupe — with an estimated £130,000 price tag when it goes on sale within three years — have been leaked out.

Bosses believe it's just the job to tempt 007 to defect from his five decade big-screen affair with Aston Martin — and go back to his first love from the original Ian Fleming books, in which he drove a supercharged 'blowers' Bentley. Motoring magazine Autocar has produced images of how the Crewe-built car will look.

It comes as Bentley also prepares to launch its first 4x4 SUV, the Bentayga. Autocar editor-in-chief Steve Cropley says in the latest edition of the world's longest-running motoring magazine that Bentley is out to 'steal Aston Martin's lunch'.

The new car is likely to be powered initially by a specially tweaked 500bhp, four-litre, twinturbo, V8 engine introduced recently into other Bentley models. But higher-powered options are likely to match the 200mph top speed of other cars in the firm's range.

Bentley sales director Kevin Rose says: 'The advantage of a smaller car is that it would enable us to have something to go up against Aston Martin or Maserati.'
