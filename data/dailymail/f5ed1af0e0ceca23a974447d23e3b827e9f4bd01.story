Charged: Danny Sevilla, 33, was pulled out of his car Friday then charged with drunk driving in the wrong direction

A Chicago police officer has been charged with drunk driving down a freeway in the wrong direction at 6am.

Danny Sevilla, 33, was pulled out of his car by colleagues Friday morning after speeding north towards downtown Chicago in the southbound lane.

Other motorists told how they chased him and slammed down on their horns when Sevilla drove down the exit ramp on the I-57 freeway at 5.45am.

The bystanders managed to catch up with Sevilla, driving in a black Mitsubishi Outlander, open the door and cut the ignition, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Police later turned up and patted him down - finding out in the process that he had a gun.

Sevilla, driving in a black Mitsubishi Outlander, was relieved of police powers and put on admin duties instead.

Police sources say he seemed drunk when they got him out of the car. They found that he had a gun.

Jujuan Williams,42, was driving to the gym when he came across Sevilla.

He said: 'With trucks coming...he was definitely headed for a head on collision if we hadn't stopped him.'

Nobody was injured during the incident, and nothing got hit, as freeway traffic was light at that hour. Sevilla was the only one in the car.
