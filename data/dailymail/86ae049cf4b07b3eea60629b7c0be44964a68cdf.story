Rapped: Earlier this month an investment scheme used by Gary Barlow, pictured, and other members of Take That was struck down by a tribunal

Clamping down on Gary Barlow-style tax-dodging schemes led to HMRC collecting a record £23.9billion through its investigations in the last year.

This was £3.2 billion more than the previous year and £9billion up on three years ago.

The sum, which is in addition to regular tax revenues, was £1billion above the target set by George Osborne in his 2013 autumn statement.

HMRC has seen its resources bolstered, with an army of 2,500 extra tax inspectors announced 18 months ago. But critics of the tax system say corporate giants such as Amazon and Google can still get away with paying a pittance.

By funnelling money into offshore havens, large multinational companies are able to whittle down their tax bills to almost nothing in a practice that is legal but has been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs.

Earlier this month an investment scheme used by Gary Barlow and other members of Take That was struck down by a tribunal.

The ‘Icebreaker’ scheme was used by almost 1,000 people in an attempt to hide more than £300million from authorities.

It claimed to invest in the music industry, claiming legitimate tax breaks.

But a judge ruled that the setup was a wheeze used to dodge tax, and that no-body would seriously invest in it to make a profit.

Since it was ruled illegal, the Take That star has faced called to be stripped of his OBE.

Mr Barlow, who has refused to apologise, also faced criticism from David Cameron over the affair.

The Prime Minister said he was ‘opposed to all aggressive tax avoidance’ and has previously called dodging schemes used by comedian Jimmy Carr ‘morally wrong’.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said Mr Barlow ‘might want to show a bit of contrition by giving back his OBE’.

When investment schemes that claim tax relief are set up, they have to be registered with HMRC.

Tax authorities can then judge if they are legitimate investment projects, or merely a chance to try and rake in tax relief.

HMRC then tries to shut down the scheme by pursuing it through the courts, and has been successful 80 per cent of the time.

It has raked in £2.7billion by tackling such schemes in the last 12 months, HMRC said yesterday.

A further £8billion has been collected by preventing big businesses from claiming tax relief for which they were not eligible.

Another £1billion was raked in after preventing criminal tax evasion – where people or businesses simply lie about their revenues.

David Gauke, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘We set HMRC ambitious targets to increase its yield and the figures published today demonstrate that HMRC is successfully meeting these challenges.

‘It also sends a clear signal – HMRC will pursue those seeking to avoid their responsibilities and will collect the taxes that are due.’
