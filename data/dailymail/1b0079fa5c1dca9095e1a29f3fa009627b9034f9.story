David Cameron was engrossed in his daily 4pm strategy meeting with George Osborne in 10 Downing Street when an aide appeared and slipped a sheet of paper in front of him.

It was a copy of a gushing profile of Theresa May in Spectator Life magazine. The article was about to be published – deliberately timed in the days running up to the Home Secretary’s appearance last month as a castaway on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs.

Both were key elements (along with a TV interview with Andrew Marr) in what was seen as a carefully-orchestrated media blitz by Mrs May.

Theresa May is the overwhelming choice of Tory activists to be their next party leader - and No10 has been looking for the chance to punish the increasingly confident Home Secretary

Understandably, this triggered speculation that she was ‘on manoeuvres’ to position herself as the prime candidate to take over the Conservative leadership should Mr Cameron lose May’s general election and step down.

What’s more, the profile – the author of which had clearly got the co-operation of the Home Secretary’s colleagues who wanted to show a more human side of her – contained withering criticism of Mr Cameron.

The PM soon spotted a devastating quote from an unnamed friend of Mrs May, saying: ‘She doesn’t rate Cameron any more… slowly she has seen just how incompetent that operation is. How the PM will say he will do one thing, only to be drawn in another direction. She’s given up on him.’

Not surprisingly, particularly at a time when the Tories should be pulling together to fight off the dual threat of Labour and Ukip, these incendiary remarks were seen by Mr Cameron and his Downing Street team as a declaration of war by the ambitious Home Secretary, who is the overwhelming choice of Tory activists to be their next party leader.

But what also leapt from the page was a quote from Nick Timothy, Mrs May’s longest serving special adviser.

Glowingly, he said: ‘Read her speeches. They go way beyond being a mere technocrat, they have a vision what the future should be about and what politics and the party should be about.’

Such an encomium from a minister’s special adviser was unprecedented. In 25 years reporting at Westminster, I can’t recall a special adviser – a temporary civil servant employed to help a minister on matters where the work of Government and the work of the minister’s party overlap – being quoted in the media by name.

Anonymity is not merely Whitehall convention, it is a clear Civil Service rule that special advisers, who are political appointees paid for by the taxpayer, should not be named in such briefings.

The fact is that Mr Timothy, who is paid £74,000 a year and has been with the Home Secretary since 2010, must have spoken on the record with her knowledge.

The assumption, therefore, is that Mrs May authorised her staff to promote her image and vision for the future of Britain.

The co-operation of Mrs May’s advisers with Spectator Life magazine was seen by Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and Tory party chairman Grant Shapps as just the latest act of treachery from the Home Office team.

The poisonous briefing against Mr Cameron to a magazine, regarded as the in-house journal of the Tory right, is all the more remarkable considering that in June, Mrs May was left badly bruised after the traitorous behaviour of another of her special advisers, Fiona Cunningham, who was revealed to be the source for a vituperative newspaper attack on Mrs May’s Cabinet rival Michael Gove over Islamic extremism in schools.

No10 has been looking for the chance to punish the increasingly confident Mrs May. The perfect opportunity came when her most senior aide, Mr Timothy, sought selection as a candidate for a safe Tory seat. He was blocked and another of Mrs May’s team, Stephen Parkinson, has also been suspended from the party’s approved candidates list after Mr Cameron signed off a recommendation from party chairman Mr Shapps.

Ultimately, the two men’s political ambitions have been sacrificed as part of Mr Cameron’s brutal reaction to Mrs May’s campaign to succeed him.

Many Tories say that Mr Timothy’s devotion to his boss has backfired. A ministerial source told me: ‘For two years, he’s been running a thinly-disguised leadership campaign for Theresa May. He has not been playing by the rules and is very rude. Rather than stab people in the back, he’s brazen enough to stab them in the front.’

With less than five months to go before the general election, Theresa May and her team of aides are playing a potentially suicidal game – for history shows that voters punish parties that indulge in pointless and petty civil wars.
