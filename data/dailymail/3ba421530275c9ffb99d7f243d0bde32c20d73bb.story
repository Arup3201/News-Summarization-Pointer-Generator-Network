Southampton have had a £12million accepted for Hull City striker Shane Long.

Manager Ronald Koeman wants a proven Premier League performer to support Graziano Pelle and the Republic of Ireland international Long has been recommended by Southampton scouts.

Long only joined Hull last January from West Bromwich Albion in a £7million deal with Nikica Jelavic joining also from Everton.

Wanted: Shane Long could be set for a surprise £10million move to Southampton

Hull are reluctant to sell Long so soon but recognise an opportunity to make a quick profit.

They will push Southampton to raise their offer though as a replacement will not be cheap to find.

Manager Steve Bruce has an interest in Liverpool's Fabio Borini.

The Italian is the subject of a £14m bid from Sunderland but remains to be convinced it is the right move as Gus Poyet struggles to get the other players he wants in.

Bruce will struggle to match that bid and will evaluate other possibilities with the likes of Connor Wickham, Diafra Sakho and Nicklas Bendtner possibiities.

Southampton have agreed a £450,000 fee with Leeds United for striker Billy Sharp.
