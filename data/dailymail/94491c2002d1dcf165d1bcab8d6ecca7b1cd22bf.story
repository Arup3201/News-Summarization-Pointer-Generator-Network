A former soldier from Fiji has won his battle to stay in the UK after issuing a personal appeal to Prime Minister David Cameron.

Filimone Lacanivalu - who served with 
the Army for nine years - was facing deportation after he failed to fill
in the necessary forms on his discharge from the service.

But after his case was taken up in the press and by MPs, he has now been told that he can settle in Britain.

Mr Lacanivalu, who served with the 2nd
Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Northern 
Ireland, said he was a 'happy man' now that his case had been resolved.

'I have been in the forces, I've put 
in effort, sacrificed my life for this country. I just think to stay 
here will be a benefit, there's more opportunities,' he told BBC Radio 
4's Today programme.

Home Secretary Theresa May and 
immigration minister Mark Harper were reported to have personally 
reviewed his case before deciding he could remain.

Mr Lacanivalu, who spent five weeks in
a detention centre awaiting deportation to Fiji, said it had never been
explained to him that he would need to apply to remain in the UK when 
he left the Army.

'I was not aware of that because I did
not receive any instructions from the Army itself or the Ministry of 
Defence before I left the forces,' he said.

Pte Lacanivalu was held at Harmondsworth immigration detention centre, near Heathrow, awaiting deportation on Sunday. Others held at the centre include murderers, rapists and drug dealers.

Last night he said he felt ‘betrayed’ by Britain. He said: ‘It is confusing, sad and depressing.

In
his plea to Mr Cameron, he said: 'Please take account of my military 
service and what I have done for Great Britain. Release me from here and
I will continue my life as usual.’

Campaigners
for Pte Lacanivalu contrasted his case with that of foreigners who have
been allowed to stay in Britain despite awful crimes, such as Iraqi Aso
Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his 
car.

His case also appeared at odds with Mr Cameron’s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant, society’s duty of care to servicemen.

Pte Lacanivale, whose uncles served in the Army, including one who fought with the Parachute Regiment in the Falklands, signed up with 2 YORKS in 2001 after seeing photographs of ceremonial parades at Buckingham Palace.

He served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, the Falklands and deployed on two tours of fierce fighting in Afghanistan.

He left the Forces in January 2010 but several months later received documents from the Army informing him he should have applied for residency within 28 days.

The soldier claimed he was not told of this requirement while in the Army.

He hired a solicitor to issue a belated application to remain in Britain but he was informed in September he had been rejected.

On October 12 he went to a Home Office centre in Croydon, South London, hoping to resolve the situation but he was detained without being allowed to return to his flat to collect his belongings.
