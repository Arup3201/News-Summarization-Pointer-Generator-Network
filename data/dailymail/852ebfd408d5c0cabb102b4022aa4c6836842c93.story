Maldon Carnival had been hoping Beyonce would be the star attraction at this year's event - until she demanded a £50,000 fee

Organisers of a town carnival in Essex thought they had pulled off a remarkable coup after global superstar Beyonce agreed to be the headline performer - only to find out her fee would be £50,000.

Ambitious members of Maldon Carnival had been turned down by Britney Spears, Rod Stewart, Will.i.am, Jessie J, Taylor Swift, Justin Timberlake, Rita Ora and even the Queen before the singer appeared to show an interest.

Her agent sent an email saying: 'There is a possibility that Beyonce will be available and hopefully can attend your carnival event.'

But after a ten minute meeting with red-faced executives, the plans were quickly scuppered after it emerged Beyonce could not appear for free and would require a £50,000 fee.

An email confirmation of the meeting read: 'After our conversation, it is apparent there is some miscommunication.

'Beyonce will require an appearance fee to attend your carnival.

'Regrettably, it is unlikely your carnival will be able to attract the audience required or have the necessary experience to handle such a large event.'

The Maldon Carnival in August includes a procession, a bonny baby competition, spot-the-stranger and clairvoyant evening and last year made £1,200 for charity.

Tickets for Beyonce's 11 stadium shows in the UK sold out in 15 minutes earlier this week and the singer is worth an estimated £500million with her rapper husband Jay-Z.

Carnival organiser, Rob Slight, said he was disappointed but maintained that the mix up would not stop him in his bid to book a big name celebrity for the event.

He added: 'We are really trying to build it up and make it bigger and better than ever before.

'I think the carnival is so old-fashioned. We want to keep it traditional, but it needs to be modernised to attract the younger generation.'

The former Destiny's Child singer is still due to headline this summer's V Festival just ten miles 
away in Chelmsford, Essex, in front of 90,000 fans.
