It was fright night for Real Madrid in Bulgaria as minnows Ludogorets stunned the European Cup holders with a goal after six minutes and then made Carlo Ancelotti’s team toil for a hard-fought win.

Ronaldo missed one penalty and scored another, moving him to 69 Champions League goals – just two short of Raul’s record – but Wednesday  was not a night for Madrid milestones, more of narrowly avoiding embarrassment.

They started slowly, defended badly and former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez almost completed the horror show with an awful second-half miss with the score still at 1-1. He was replaced by Karim Benzema, who scored what was to be Real’s winner.

It was the Bulgarian team’s first home game in the Champions League, and they weren’t even ‘properly’ at home. With UEFA regulations meaning the club could not use its tiny 6,100-capacity Ludogorets Arena, they had had to make the 324km journey to Sofia to play the game in Bulgaria’s national stadium.

Around 5,000 of their home town Razgrad’s 33,000 population had made the five-hour road trip to watch their team and they were given a night they will never forget.

Madrid were behind inside just six minutes when they failed to defend a corner. Sergio Ramos and Gareth Bale were beaten at the near post and Marcelinho ghosted in at the back post ahead of a static Alvaro Arbeloa to head in the flick on.

Real had the chance to equalise almost immediately but Ronaldo failed to convert a penalty. Hernandez went down in the box and the Portugal superstar stepped up with a customary well-struck spot kick but keeper Vladislav Stoyanov guessed right and saved.

Ronaldo then had the ball in the net but was incorrectly flagged offside in what was turning into a nightmare first away game for the holders.

On 24 minutes Real's No 7 won his second penalty of the night with an exaggerated tumble after contact from Cosmin Moti. He put the penalty the same side and this time, despite Stoyanov going the right way again, the net bulged and Madrid were level.

Three minutes before half time Hernandez had the chance to put the visitors ahead but dragged his shot wide from Isco’s pass. The midfielder had been the away side’s best player but there was little competition with Bale and Luka Modric below par and Real missing Toni Kroos, who had been left on the bench.

Bale improved at the start of the second half and could have put Madrid ahead with a header from an Isco cross that Stoyanov did well to save.

Madrid’s next chance was not saved but missed, dreadfully, by Hernandez. The former Manchester United striker only had to tap in Isco’s centre after a classic Madrid counter-attack involving a 30-metre sprint from Bale and a pass from Ronaldo, but somehow ‘Chicharito’ spooned his effort away from goal.

Ludogorets had chances to take the lead and only a fine save from Iker Casillas prevented Marcelinho from scoring his and the Bulgarians’ second.

Ancelotti finally made a change and predictably it was Hernandez who made way for Benzema. The Frenchman immediately set up Ronaldo but his effort was cleared off the line by Yordan Minev.

Benzema then saved Madrid’s blushes with the late winner from Marcelo’s cross. The full back made an important clearance to maintain the visitors' advantage moments later and Bale brought a fine save from Stoyanov at the death.

Madrid were off the hook and go into their double-header with Liverpool on six points. But this was yet more evidence that the biggest of the big spenders have weaknesses that  Brendan Rodgers’ side will hope to expose.
