With a new season comes a new wardrobe and many fashionistas live by the motto 'out with the old and in with the new.'

The seasonal shift is often the catalyst for many to clear their summer 
wardrobes to get rid of last season's trends and make space for new garments.

But unbeknown to many, a staggering 9,513 items of clothing are disposed of every five minutes by the British public.

Marks and Spencer have joined with Oxfam to encourage women to recycle their old clothes

So, in charitable fashion, high-street giant Marks and Spencer have joined forces with Oxfam to launch a campaign which aims to end the disposal of this many clothes.

'Shwopping' is the revolutionary 
sustainable fashion initiative created by M&S and Oxfam, asking 
consumers to adopt a ‘buy one, give one’ mentality when shopping and 
encourage greater sustainability on the high street.

The campaign aims to put an end to
the one billion items currently ending up in landfill every year.

All M&S clothing stores now
accept used and unwanted items of clothing from any brand, all year 
round with items going to Oxfam to be resold, re-used or recycled.

The partners have enlisted the help of two ‘Queens of Style’ to help the British public clear out their wardrobe ahead of the new autumn season and encourage them to give their unwanted items of clothing a future life through the retailer’s shwopping initiative.

US Glamour magazine’s Fashion Editor-at-Large, Louise Roe and TV presenter Zara Martin have each given a clear step-by-step guide to consumers to give their wardrobe a diet and help the environment at the same time.

Louise Roe said: 'Be brutal, throw out anything you haven’t worn in two years or more. If you haven’t been attracted to it in that long, you never will be – but someone else might!'

Zara Martin sent a clear message to those thinking that they will one day fit into their treasured old items again: 'It doesn't fit anymore, move on.'

Past ‘on trend’ items of clothing have also been dealt a blow with Roe stating: 'Any trends that you wore the first time that they were in fashion (i.e. 70’s flares, 80’s shoulder pads) rarely work again on you decades later, unless it’s a timeless evening piece.'

Martin added: 'You tried the trend. RIP. Now, remove the remnants.'

Louise Roe gives her top tips on how to be brutal with your clothes

Spend a Sunday afternoon 
giving your wardrobe some rehab- you can't do this half-heartedly. So get the whole lot out on your bed and buy new hangers, drawer 
separators, boxes to label, it'll feel like a totally fresh start and 
you might find some hidden gems

Throw out anything you 
haven't worn in two years or more. If you haven't been attracted to it 
in that long, you never will be.

If a garment is two or more 
sizes too small or too big - chuck it. You don't need visual reminders 
of how skinny or chubby you used to be. Better to love dressing the body
you have now!

Don't be too sentimental. Of 
course, hang onto anything that makes you well up at the thought of 
losing it, but clinging onto garments because they remind you of 
ex-boyfriends or drunken nights at university, are just not worth it.

Any trends that you wore the 
first time that they were in fashion (ie. 70's flares, 80's shoulder 
pads) rarely works again on you decades later, unless it's a more 
timeless evening piece. I hate to be brutal, but if you were rocking 
bright eye shadows and neon’s in the 80's, you shouldn't be rocking them
out again now!

'If it doesn't fit anymore, move on' says Zara Martin

Stop being a hoarder:  If you have 
clothing with the labels still on it hanging in your closet, the general
rule is you're probably never going to wear it. Admit it was a mistake 
and get rid.

It doesn’t fit anymore, move 
on: We all have a pair of jeans lurking somewhere deep within our 
wardrobes that we wish we could still fit into - 'Inspiration jeans', if
you will. In reality, they serve as a constant reminder of the good 
times (before we discovered Krispy Kreme). Say bye-bye, embrace the ones
that do fit AND the booty!

Stick to what you know: You tried the Bo-Ho (insert equivalent) 'trend'. RIP. Now, remove the remnants.

Quality, not quantity: One 
well-cut jacket is infinitely better than 3-5 mediocre ones. Invest in 
quality, timeless pieces that you can enjoy wearing over and over again.

There are no seasons: We live
in the UK. Bummer for us that summer looks like winter and vice versa. 
Do you really need another pair of short-shorts?
