The parents of a stabbing victim have appealed for help in tracing the thief who stole mementos from the grave of their late daughter.

This image has been released by West Midlands Police after inquiries failed to identify who was responsible for stealing eight small ornaments from a memorial to Christina Edkins.

Christina, aged 16, was stabbed to death on a bus in Birmingham city centre in a random attack in March last year.

Her family said they were 'heartbroken' by the theft of the trinkets - which were of little financial worth, but huge sentimental value.

Police investigating the theft of tributes from a Birmingham memorial to a teenage stabbing victim have released this CCTV image of a woman they want to trace

In a statement issued by police, her father Jason Edkins said: 'We as a family are still trying to come to terms with the fact that every morning we wake up and our daughter or sister won't be there.

'All we have left is our precious memories, photos and our stories of the 16 years and two weeks she spent in our life.

'We also now have a headstone and plot where we can take flowers and little trinkets to make it look as beautiful as Christina was.

'So, you can imagine how heartbroken and shocked we were to discover that someone had taken eight things off her plot in July.

'They weren't of much value in money but they were very meaningful to us as they were brought not only by us but our extended family and Christina's schoolfriends.'

The CCTV image was taken at Birmingham Crematorium in Perry Barr on Sunday July 6 and shows a woman in a purple top walking with a white dog.

Inspector Karen Geddes, who is responsible for neighbourhood policing in the Perry Barr area of the city, said: 'Christina's family are of course devastated by what's happened because the items have a great deal of sentimental significance. 

Brutal: Christina Edkins, 16, was stabbed to death by Phillip Simelane, 23, who pleaded guilty to her manslaughter

'It's difficult to try and understand why someone would want to remove them because they have little monetary value, but our primary aim is to try and get them back so they can be returned to the memorial, where they belong.

'I would ask anyone who recognises the woman in the image to come forward and let us know who she is by giving us a call or by contacting Crimestoppers anonymously.

'If you are the person in the CCTV, then I would ask you directly to please get in touch so that we can resolve the matter.'

Paranoid schizophrenic Phillop Simelane stabbed the schoolgirl to death on a bus three months after he was released from 
prison without supervision or treatment.

Simelane, 23, had a long history of mental illness and his own mother 
had previously begged a judge to admit him to a secure hospital after he
 threatened her with a knife.

Simelane, who had been smoking cannabis before the attack, admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in October last year.

He was detained indefinitely in a secure psychiatric hospital.

Anyone with information can contact West Midlands Police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
