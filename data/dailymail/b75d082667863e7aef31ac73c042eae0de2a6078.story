Garment worker Didar Hossain spent 50 hours releasing survivors from the wreckage.

He amputated the limbs of survivors who were wedged under the ruins.

He describes how he cut off a young girl's hand and man's leg with a knife to free them from the ruins.

Workers dig mass graves during a mass burial of unidentified garment workers, who died in the collapse of the Rana Plaza building

Didar Hossain spent 50 hours releasing survivors from the wreckage. He was forced to amputate the limbs of trapped survivors

Survivors were found at the site up to five days after the building collapsed. The death toll continues to rise and rescue workers say many more are trapped under the building

He had been working in a factory opposite the Rana Plaza complex when it collapsed and rushed to help the rescue effort.

In an interview with BBC World Service, he said he helped 34 people. He performed the amputations with a knife and some anesthetic.

He spent five hours helping a young girl on the day after the collapse. Her hand was trapped under crumbled concrete.

Mr Hossain said: 'I went out again and told a doctor who was there that he
needed to cut off her hand to get her out.

'But he said: "I can't go in
there, I'm frightened. You do it." So he gave me a knife and some
anaesthetic so I could amputate her hand.

'She watched while I amputated her hand. She was screaming and I
was screaming too, and I cried when I saw her crying. I felt really bad, but
there was no other way,' he told BBC reporters.

He said that two men who were trapped beside the young girl begged him to do the same so they could escape.

Dozens of unclaimed bodies were buried in Dhaka today in the wake of the horrific accident, which claimed the lives of more than 500 workers

A crowd gathered in front of the row of graves at the traditional Muslim funeral today, following the horrific collapse that exposed the unsafe conditions plaguing Bangladesh's garment industry

Several hundred people attended the mass burial in Dhaka today, which took place amid calls for the owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, to face the death penalty

Mr Hossain said he cut off one man's leg without any anesthetic and he managed to crawl out of the ruins on his own.

Stories of miraculous rescue efforts come as the death toll rises and there is continued confusion over how many people are missing.

The death toll from
the Bangladesh factory which collapsed last week has now passed 500 
after another 29 bodies were pulled from the rubble last night.

Hundreds of workers
were inside the eight-storey building near the capital of Dhaka when it
collapsed into rubble last week, many of whom are still unaccounted 
for.

The Rana Plaza 
housed five garment factories and with the new death toll of 507, the 
disaster is now ranked the second most deadly structural failure in 
modern times after 9/11.

The collapse was caused by four 
powergenerators located on the roof, the head of a government inquiry 
into the disaster said today.

The
four generators started up when the power was cut following an 
earthquake, and this may have caused the building to fall in on itself.

The owner of the building is expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work - which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail

Rescue workers fear the death toll could rise even further after the collapse, which reduced the building filled with workers to an estimated 600 tons of rubble

The building collapse, in which over 500 people died and 2,500 were injured, was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history

Rescue workers expect the number of 
dead to rise because they believe many bodies are still buried on the 
ground level of the building.

The building's owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana has been arrested along with the engineers who designed the building.

Rana had permission to build five storeys but added three more illegally.

When huge cracks appeared in the 
building a day before its collapse, police ordered an evacuation, but 
Rana told tenants it was safe.

The next day, a bank and some shops refused to open but factory managers told their workers to go back inside.

Just hours later the building came down in a heap of concrete.

Rescuers estimate the building turned into 600 tons of rubble, of which 350 tons have been removed.
