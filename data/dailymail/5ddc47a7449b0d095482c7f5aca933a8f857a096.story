Sunderland’s £6.5million playmaker Emanuele Giaccherini will miss the rest of the season.

The former Juventus man has managed just four starts in an injury-ravaged campaign and suffered a recurrence of an ankle problem during the FA Cup win at Fulham earlier this month.

And after seeing a specialist this week it is now almost certain that 29-year-old Giaccherini will not be seen again until next season.

Black Cats boss Gus Poyet said: ‘Emanuele is going to be out for a while.

‘It is incredible that he had a big injury after the Burnley game (in September) and it took him a while to come back. Then when you think everything is good he had another knock in the same area on the same bone and now it is going to take a little bit longer.

‘He is practically going to be out right until the end of the season which is unfortunate for us, but we wish him well and I want to see a full recovery - not a quick one - so that we can count on him next year.

‘Let’s say that it is a season to forget for Giaccherini, so we just need to make sure he feels perfect for next season.’
