The students at MIT are among the smartest in the country so it comes as no surprise that they have the most ingenious beer pong table for when they need to break away from the books.

A company in Cambridge, Massachusetts has developed a beer pong table that self-cleans and has spouts to sanitize the ping pong balls mid-game.

The water will be not be added to the spillage of Keystone Light, as there is a gutter that collects all of the run-off.

Seemingly normal: This custom beer pong table was built with far more technology than immediately meets the eye

Precautions have been taken should games get really rowdy and the tables need to hold more than their triangles of Solo cups.

The custom table holds up to 215 pounds, meaning even one of the heavier co-eds would be able to jump on top without breaking it.

A final touch that showed fraternal pride was the placement of a glow-in-the-dark decoration with the Greek letters making up the group's name, Phi Beta Epsilon.

The spraying water won't damage the wood table or the well-lit sign as it has been oak stained and treated with a waterproofing sealant and covered with an additional layer of polyurethane.

In house: The beer pong table was made for an MIT frat by a local engineering company that was founded by former MIT students

Wiring: The system beneath the table (left) allows for water to be sprayed to clean the top and the balls but a gutter (right) on the sides keeps that from making a mess

Keeping it clean: Each side of the table has a spot where the players can push the balls into a tube for cleaning at the right and then it pops up (pictured) sanitized on the left side

'Reliability and innovation were two key factors in creating this table as it was likely to be used and abused for many years with minimal maintenance,' the company website boasts.

The table was constructed by Outsmarting Technologies and though it may appear as if it was outsourced away from students, the company is run by alums from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology so it was kept in the family.

Just because of their connections doesn't mean that the table came at a bargain-basement price, however, as CBS Boston reports that the table costs about $1,200. 

Final touch: The table can hold up to 215 pounds of weight in case the game gets really rowdy
