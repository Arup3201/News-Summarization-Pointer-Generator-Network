A teenager who jumped on his ex-girlfriend's head after she criticised the size of his penis has been jailed for five years.

Callan Redshaw, 19, from Hartlepool, kicked Kirsty Robinson 'like a footballer taking a penalty' and jumped on her head repeatedly, leaving her with serious injuries after they had a row outside a pub.

Teeside Crown Court heard that Miss Robinson, the mother of Redshaw's one-year-old daughter, told him: 'You can give me a f****** baby, but you can’t pay for the keep of her. You’ve got a little penis, I don’t know how you managed.'

Redshaw then kicked her legs from underneath Miss Robinson who fell to the ground 'like a sack of potatoes', Teesside Crown Court heard.

Redshaw punched and kicked her, leaving her lying motionless 'like a ragdoll' with two head fractures and bleeding in her brain.

Prosecutor Sue Jacobs said: 'He started to kick her by running up like a footballer taking a penalty, taking his leg right back and really booting her.

'They were the witness’s words. He did this about four or five times in her back. She described the victim as being like a rag doll, and said it looked like she was unconscious.

'Then she said he stamped on her head. His left foot was coming off the floor to put his full weight on his right foot, and she said her head was bouncing.

'After that he walked away. The girl was still lying there, not moving.'

Court: Judge Simon Bourne- Arton, QC, told Redshaw: 'Anyone who takes a shod foot to anybody' can expect jail

Miss Robinson and Redshaw, who have a one-year-old daughter, split up at the start of last year.

After the attack, which happened in Hartlepool, Miss Robinson was taken to hospital where a CT scan confirmed she had a fractured skull and cheekbone and some bleeding in her brain.

In a victim statement she said: 'This incident has left me totally devastated and feeling very emotional.'

Redshaw, who admitted grievous bodily harm with intent at a hearing on May 12 last year, was jailed for five years.

Recorder
 of Middlesbrough, Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, said: 'You have 
obviously got a temper. On the night of this your ex-partner was clearly
 drunk.

'She was therefore 
vulnerable because a drunk woman can’t handle herself in any way, and 
you knew she was essentially helplessly drunk.

'Worst
 of all you stamped on her head. That can very often result in very 
serious injury, if not death, and it will not be overlooked.

'Anyone who takes a shod foot to anybody, particularly a female, can only receive a substantial period of imprisonment.'
