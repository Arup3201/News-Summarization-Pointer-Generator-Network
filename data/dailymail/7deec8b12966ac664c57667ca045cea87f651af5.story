The mother of a 14-year-old boy who is already a Master's student and well on his way to earning a PhD in quantum physics, was once told her son would most likely struggle with basic everyday tasks such as tying his shoes laces.

Jacob Barnett was diagnosed with moderate to severe autism aged two, yet now has an IQ higher than Albert Einstein and has been tipped as a future Nobel Prize winner.

His mom, Kristine Barnett, has written a book – ‘The Spark: A Mother's Story of Nurturing Genius’ - about her experiences raising him and why she chose to ignore the experts when it came to treating her son's condition.

Kristine Barnett said felt ‘hopeless’ when she was first told about her son’s illness.

‘The perceived wisdom on autism was that we would be working on very basic skills for Jacob for the rest of his life,’ she told CTV’s Canada AM on Tuesday morning.

While the experts said her son needed to spend more time on special education, she chose to follow her son’s ‘spark'. Rather than focusing on what her child couldn’t do, Barnett said she decided to focus on something he enjoyed - the stars.

At night, she would take her son outside to listen to jazz and gaze at the sky.

As her young son's passion for the stars grew she looked to feed his thirst for knowledge and took him to a lecture at an observatory.

Much to her surprise when the professor asked a question about the Red Planet, ‘his little hand shot up and he knew the answer,’ she said.

Quickly it emerged that Jacob had an amazing capacity for learning. He taught himself calculus in just two weeks and began working on an original theory in astrophysics at the age of nine.

Since enrolling at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) at the age of 10, Barnett has flourished - astounding his professors, peers and family with his spectacular intelligence.

He became a paid researcher in quantum physics at the age of 12 and can recite 205 of the digits in the number pi.

For other parents feeling hopeless over their child’s autism diagnosis Barnett has a message.

'In every child, there is a spark,” she said. A movie deal is said to be in the works.
