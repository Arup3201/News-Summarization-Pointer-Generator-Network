A Russian circus trainer claims he saved two of his elephants from freezing to death by getting them to drink vodka.

The animals, named Madga and Jenny, had to be evacuated from their trailer after it caught fire in the middle of a Siberian highway outside the city of Novosibirsk yesterday.

Although the pair escaped the blaze unharmed, with temperatures plummeting to as low as -40C, trainer Leonid Labo was facing a serious problem.

His answer was to dilute 10 litres of vodka diluted in warm water and made sure they drank the whole lot.

'They roared like it was the jungle…They must have been happy,' a district official told news agency RIA Novosti.

The Indian elephants, aged 45 and 48, were part of a travelling Polish circus that was headed from Novokuznetsk to Omsk late yesterday.

The blaze started when hay in their trailer caught fire from the diesel engine heating the cargo section.

A local official said a trainer made the animals jog before giving them two cases of vodka to drink.

Emergency minister spokesman Alexander Davydov said the elephants were then delivered to a warm gym at a local community college.

They were later examined by a veterinarian who said only the tips of their ears had suffered frostbite.

Novosibisk zoo director Rostislav Shilo claimed the vodka saved the animals from frostbite and 
pneumonia, without harming or even intoxicating them.

The handler was also treated in hospital for frostbite.

Scientists say while alcohol can make you feel warmer, it actually lowers the body's core temperature and could actually increase your chances of getting hypothermia if you're stuck out in the cold.
