A Pennsylvania man accused of shooting dead his long-time girlfriend with a gun he bought at Walmart posted a photograph of the weapon and bragged to friends on Facebook the day before the alleged murder.

Gregory Twyman, 44, called 911 on Tuesday afternoon and said: 'I need the police, I just shot my girlfriend.'

He was still on the phone to police, sitting on his porch with a cigarette, when investigators arrived and found Jamica Woods, 37, the mother of his 18-year-old daughter, inside with a fatal bullet wounds to her torso, police said.

Police recovered a 12-gauge shotgun inside the Coatesville house.

On Monday, Twyman uploaded a picture of the firearm and ammunition on Facebook.

A friend immediately asked: 'What is that bro???'

'A shell fool,' Twyman responded.

'I'm calling the ATF on your ass now... LOL...,' the friend joked.

'Gon be too late,' Twyman wrote.

Another friend commented in: 'CIA FBI ATF u know snitches be lurking amongst us on here... lol.'

'Once I handle my business I don't give a f***!' Twyman responded.

Twyman told detectives he had been fighting with Woods for days. He said he purchased the shells at Walmart last week.

On Tuesday night, Twyman was arraigned on murder charges in Downingtown.

Around 25 of Woods' friends and family members, including the pair's daughter, Janaija, gathered outside the court, screaming at him as he was escorted inside by East Fallowfield police.

Twyman has prior felony convictions, police said.

Neighbors told Pottsmerc.com they were shocked by the incident, describing their community as quiet and tight-knit.

One unnamed neighbor said he was working in his yard when he heard the shots, which were fired about 10 to 15 seconds apart.
