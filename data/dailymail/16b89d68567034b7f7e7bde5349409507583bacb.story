A six-year-old schoolgirl spent more than five years with a hole in her heart before the life-threatening condition was discovered when her parents thought she had a cold.

Sophie Smith from Gateshead was only given the diagnosis of having a an atrial septal defect after she was taken to her GP by her grandmother Janice, who thought she was suffering from a common cold.

The grandmother, 55, had become concerned about Sophie when the youngster fell ill during a drama class at her school and took her to see a doctor, who discovered a murmur.

Six-year-old Sophie Smith from Gateshead with her grandmother Janice, who is recovering from open heart surgery after it was discovered she had been living with a 2.5cm hole in her heart 

The youngster, who lives with her sister Erin at her grandmother's home was then referred to Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, where it was found she was living with the serious heart defect, called atrial septal defect (ASD).

Almost immediately, she was then whisked off for life-saving open heart surgery, which involved repairing the 2.5cm hole with mesh.

Mrs Smith, an assistant medical administrator, said: 'I took Sophie to see the GP after the incident in school and he picked up a mumur.

'We were referred to the hospital but were assured it would be nothing serious but then the cardiologist said: "You do realise Sophie has a hole in her heart?"

'We couldn't believe it. The hole was quite a size and we had no idea until it was found by luck.

Sophie underwent the operation at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle after being referred there when her GP diagnosed her with a heart murmur 

'We were told that a hole in the heart usually forms at birth, so she will have been living with it her entire life.

'The hole was found in October and a month later, she was having the surgery.

'It was a bit of a whirlwind coming round to it after I thought both my granddaughters were fit and healthy.

Sophie's family first grew concerned about her health after she repeatedly suffered from colds and fell ill while at school 

Now following the operation Sophie's grandmother says she was back at school within five weeks and is as 'fit as a fiddle' 

'She seemed absolutely fine for the first five years of her life.

'Surgeons had to repair the hole by using a mesh material so the muscle would regrow to close the hole.

'They had to stop her heart at one point so it was worrying for me and her family.'

Artial septal defect is a congential heart condition that suffers are born with although the cause is unknown.

The condition usually means that there is a hole in the upper chambers of the heart, which means that the oxygen-rich and the oxygen-poor blood, instead of being kept separate, are allowed to mix and flow from the heart to the body and lungs.

Children with ASD only show mild symptoms but can be prone to more chest infections and can sometimes cause breathlessness and a heart murmur.

Some small defects just require close monitoroing as they can sometimes close on their own.

However, larger holes require surgery to correct the defect, although after surgery, most children do not need further operations, and go on to lead normal healthy lives.

A hole in the heart is a defect usually formed from birth which changes the flow of blood through the heart.

ASD is a hole in the upper chambers of the heart and allows blood to pass from one side to the other, with some oxygen-rich blood moving to the lungs instead of the entire body.

Throughout her whole life, Janice never saw any reason to be worried about Sophie's health, except that she suffered the odd cold more than usual.

She would often attribute the frequency of the colds to Sophie's pale skin and red hair.

After Sophie fell asleep in school, teachers called Mrs Smith and suggested that her granddaughter may be unwell.

She spent five days in hospital recovering from her life-saving surgery and is now back to school and living a normal life.

The 55-year-old added: 'Sophie would have runny noses and colds quite often but we thought it was just part of childhood, especially with her being at school around other children.

'She was back to school within five weeks and now she is fit as a fiddle.

'When I look at Sophie now I do see a difference in how much more energy she has.

'The unit at the Freeman hospital was fantastic. The staff were so supportive and it was an ideal place for Sophie to have the operation.

'Without them she would still be suffering with a defect that could have endangered her life, so I'll be eternally grateful to them.'
