A 28-year-old man from Los Angeles is facing two charges of animal cruelty over a video that allegedly showed him dragging a puppy down a street.

Dossey James is being held on $145,000 bail after a concerned passerby, who filmed the incident, contacted police.

The heartbreaking footage shows a tiny bull terrier type puppy being dragged along on its stomach by its leash.

Witnesses said the puppy was leaving a trail of blood behind and that the owner continued to drag it for a 'considerable distance'.

The owner dragged the dog up and down the street 'because it refused to walk' according to a police statement.

James was arrested for animal cruelty and the puppy was handed over to the Animal Cruelty Task Force.

The dog, which had several cuts on its legs and stomach, needed surgery but it is expected to make a full recovery, KTLA reported.

James had his bail set at $145,000 on January 7 because of other animal cruelty allegations made against him. He has a hearing scheduled for January 22.

Recovery: The puppy needed surgery after being pulled along and is now being cared for by an animal shelter

The case is one of several in which the public sent in video evidence using their smartphones or iPads.

'This valuable evidence has contributed greatly to the identification of suspects and criminal charges of animal cruelty being filed,' a police spokesman said.

'Witnesses come to the realization that anyone that would commit such horrific acts of violence on defenseless animals could also do the same to humans,' according to LAPD.
