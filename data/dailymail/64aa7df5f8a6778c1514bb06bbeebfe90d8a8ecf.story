England have hailed the ‘X factor’ of Ben Stokes after his recall to the squad for next week’s first Test against India at Trent Bridge.

The Durham all-rounder was the lone shining light to emerge from the disastrous  5-0 whitewash in Australia during the winter, scoring a century at Perth and grabbing six wickets in Sydney.

But he missed the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh and the recent series against  Sri Lanka after fracturing a wrist punching a dressing-room locker in frustration  during England’s tour of the Caribbean in March.

England
 insisted he had not proven his match fitness in time to take on the Sri
 Lankans, but a 10-wicket haul against Sussex last month  settled 
selectorial nerves and Stokes was on Wednesday added to the 12-man party
 who took on Sri Lanka.

With
 English cricket looking for an instant pick-up following the unexpected
 1-0 defeat by Sri Lanka, national selector James Whitaker said of 
Stokes: ‘He’s a vivacious character, he’s got some X factor and he’s 
fantastic on flat wickets.

‘He gets movement off the ball and the pitch and we’re really encouraged by Ben.’

Stokes
 could bat as low as No 8 and, with Whitaker insisting that the new-ball
 pairing of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad are ‘100 per cent fit’, he 
is likely to replace Sussex  all-rounder Chris Jordan in the starting 
XI, as well as leapfrog Warwickshire’s Chris Woakes.

It
 is a move that would lend depth to the batting and the seam bowling, 
which is sure to be stretched to its limits in an exhausting schedule.

Whitaker
 said: ‘We have five Tests in a very short space of time and one of the 
reasons to include six seamers is that we believe at some stage they’re 
all going to play.

‘We would
 like to think the four who get picked on the day play brilliantly and 
stay fit and the world’s perfect but realistically we need a group.’

Potential: Stokes was one of very few bright spots in England's unsuccessful Ashes winter

Jordan had his moments against Sri Lanka and is one for the future, but his five Test wickets have cost 54 apiece.

Whitaker
 also had words of support for Alastair Cook, whose leadership skills 
came under fire from, among others, Shane Warne and Kevin  Pietersen 
following his display in the field on the fourth day of the Headingley 
Test.

‘We believe, given he
 is a person of integrity and has scored so many runs, that he will turn
 it around and help us to be successful,’ said Whitaker.

‘He
 is creating a very good environment and culture with Peter Moores that 
enables guys coming into the team to succeed. There’s proof in the 
performances from Sam Robson, Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Joe Root and 
Liam Plunkett. Once we start winning it will be the icing on the cake.

‘Ever
 since Graeme Swann stood down we knew we had to rebalance the team, 
look at different options. Moeen Ali will help the spin department and 
so will Joe Root. It’s a different way of balancing the team.

Regret: Stokes thinks he has to be more mature and says 'I don't think punching lockers is the way forward'

‘It
 might be difficult for the public to get used to but we’ve got three or
 four youngish spinners operating in country cricket who we, as 
selectors, feel are not quite ready yet. We have faith in Moeen and 
think he’ll perform well.’

Meanwhile,
 India’s preparations for Wednesday’s first Test in Nottingham were 
boosted by a classy innings of 81 from their No 3 Cheteshwar Pujara in 
the three-day game against Derbyshire.

When
 England and India last met in a Test series at the end of 2012, Pujara 
scored 382 runs before he was dismissed. He provided a reminder of his 
adhesive qualities against an inexperienced Derbyshire attack after the 
tourists had slipped to 18 for two.

Openers
 Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan were both dismissed for six before 
Virat Kohli — Sachin Tendulkar’s heir at No 4 — was bowled for 36 by Ben
 Cotton, a 20-year-old seamer from Stoke making his first-team debut.

India
 captain MS Dhoni then bashed a quick 46 before he was bowled on the 
charge against left-arm spinner David Wainwright. Pujara promptly 
retired out on 81.
