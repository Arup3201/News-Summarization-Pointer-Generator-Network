The expectant mother of Bode Miller's unborn child says she will will fight the Olympic downhill skier for custody of her son - days after his wife suffered a miscarriage.

Sara McKenna claims that Miller originally denied the baby - who is due next month - was his, and cut ties with her while she was pregnant.

But now, Miller is fighting for joint legal and physical custody of the 
soon-to-be-born boy.

Skier Bode Miller is named in two custody suits involving two different women

reports, Olympic skier Bode Miller had a relationship with model Sara

volleyball player

McKenna reportedly became pregnant last spring, months before Miller married his professional volleyball player Morgan Beck in October.

McKenna told TMZ: 'I will be fighting this in court and will not give up my son to someone who didn't want him to begin with.'

The news comes as Beck lost their unborn baby in a tragic miscarriage.

She broke the somber news via Twitter on January 19, but that is far from the end of her husband's baby drama.

Another suit involves a woman named Chanel Johnson, the mother of Miller's 4-year-old daughter Neesyn Dacey.

Miller is similarly fighting Johnson for
joint and physical custody, as well as child support payments.

Off the slopes, however, is a far different story. He met Morgan Beck, right, May, and the two tied the knot in October

While Miller has refrained from mentioning Johnson in the past, there is a trail of Twitter exchanges between Miller and McKenna.

On the day Miller proposed to his wife, he took to Twitter, posted a picture of his wife wearing the ring and announced: 'I have found the one!!! And convinced her to marry me.'

The celebration didn't last long.

McKenna used the micro-blogging site to accuse Miller of not acknowledging his child.

McKenna,
who on Twitter describes herself as a firefighter, ex-Marine, and 
model, posted a sonogram of her baby and included Bode in her tweet.

Miller fired back: 'There should be a mental health qualification for being allowed to participate in mass media #crazy'

The New Hampshire-born Miller met 
Beck in May and married her five months later in a private ceremony on 
his boat in San Diego in October.

Miller, the 2005 and 2008 World Cup 
overall champion and a five-time Olympic medalist, says he plans to 
return to competition following a knee injury in time to represent the 
U.S. at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Miller’s knee first bothered him last
winter when he was competing on an icy hill during a 
test race for the games after having knee surgery.

He needed microfracture surgery, during which doctors also mended cartilage that’s hampered him since a crash in 2001.

McKenna responds to Miller, clearly not happy

Miller
has been out for most of this season due to an injury. Last week he 
decided he would sit out the entire season - a first for Miller.

'It
was tough for me to miss a season of ski racing, but this decision was 
easy for me when I look at my opportunity next year,' the 35-year-old 
Miller said.

'I have said many times that motivation is a key trait for me when it comes to my racing -- I am super motivated to do great things next year.'

Miller has been so successful by doing things his way, on his terms.

That gambler's mentality has served him well in his career, leading to five Olympic medals — including that elusive gold at the 2010 Vancouver Games — four world championships and 33 World Cup wins, which is an American men's record.

U.S. coach Sasha Rearick applauded Miller's decision to slow down and not rush back into action. He wants Miller healthy in a year, not skiing on the circuit just for the sake of skiing on the circuit.

'It is an incredibly smart and strategic decision by Bode,' Rearick said. 'He's become legendary for pushing the limits of what is possible on skis, but knows an additional injury to his knee could put the 2014 Olympics in jeopardy.

'At this point, he is not fully recovered to race and has turned his focus to being 100 percent fit for Sochi.'

By shutting things down early, Miller won't lose his starting position at World Cup races next season. He will still begin with the top skiers in the world, not near the bottom when the snow has been trampled and filled with ruts.

Outside of skiing, this has been a big year for Miller. He married Beck on October 7.

She announced that she was pregnant 
and expecting the couple's first child together around Christmas before 
revealing on Saturday that she had lost the child.

'Pretty hard morning. We lost the baby :( Broken hearted but getting through it together,' Beck wrote on Saturday to her 6,590 followers.

Miller has had his share of drama away from the slopes.

In December, Miller accidentally hit his wife in the eye with a golf ball. Later, on Twitter, he posted, 'Hit wife w golfball. (hashtag)worstfeelingever.'

Photos of his wife last month showed 
her left eye completely closed and badly bloodied. She ended up getting 
more than 50 stitches.

She later posted: 'I'm not feeling so hot. Line drive to the face today with a golf ball from my darling husband. I still love.'
