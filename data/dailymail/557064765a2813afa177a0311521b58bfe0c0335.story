Lionel Messi needed just two goals to reach a career total of 400, but instead he provided two brilliant assists, with Neymar the beneficiary both times as Barcelona’s South American duo put Athletic Bilbao to the sword.

The final member of what will become Barcelona’s fearsome attacking trio, Luis Suarez, watched on from the sidelines as he continues to serve his suspension, with breakthrough star Munir El Haddadi starting for the third consecutive game instead, putting in a lively display.

Luis Enrique opted to leave centre-back Gerard Pique on the bench, instead pairing Javier Mascherano, back from suspension, with Jeremy Mathieu, back from injury. Neymar, meanwhile, also began among the substitutes after his midweek exertions for Brazil.

Enrique scored a hat-trick against Athletic in a 7-0 win at the Nou Camp back in the 2000-01 season, but Barcelona are still finding their rhythm under the Asturian and we may have wait a while to see a similar demolition.

The match started at a high tempo, with Claudio Bravo being forced to swipe away a cross from the left after a smart Ander Iturraspe interception started the move. But Barcelona responded well, with Munir firing wide of the top left corner shortly afterwards, before Pedro had an effort from close range well saved by Gorka Iraizoz.

Barcelona fans sang for independence after 17 minutes and 14 seconds, as they usually do. It had more meaning today, shortly after Catalonia’s national day, with a special canvas draped down one stand of Camp Nou as a nod to it. The teams were both wearing ‘nationalist’ kits, with Barcelona’s red and yellow striped ‘senyera’ shirt representing the Catalan flag, while Athletic sported green, white and red, the colours of the Basque Country’s Ikurrina flag.

Munir had another great chance around 20 minutes in, lashing over the bar from the edge of the box, when he should have hit the target. And after 40 minutes he could have had a free run at goal, but his first touch was poor. Instead he rolled the ball to Messi, whose shot was blocked.

In between the two Barcelona chances there were two strong penalty claims for Barcelona. The first saw Munir barged into from behind by the goalkeeper Iraizoz. The ball fell to Messi on the edge of the box, but instead of giving a penalty or waving play on, referee David Fernandez Borbalan gave Athletic a free kick. The second saw veteran defender Carlos Gurpegui shove Munir to the ground and then tumble over himself. Again, Borbalan saw no infringement. 

A couple of minutes before the interval a cross from the left came all the way though the box and Ivan Rakitic thumped it at goal, but Iraizoz was equal to it. He was on hand again to deny Munir smartly from almost underneath the crossbar, before the teams went in goalless.

Mascherano was hooked at half-time after taking a boot to the head from Athletic striker Aritz Aduriz mid-way through the first half. The forward was deservedly booked for his high foot misdemeanour.

Barca came out from the break like they meant business and within a few minutes had the ball in the back of the net. Jordi Alba cut the ball across from the left as Munir burst into the box and fired home, but it was ruled out for offside. Munir was behind Alba when he played the ball, so it was the wrong decision.

The suspended Luis Suarez was watching on from the stands and would have relished some of the opportunities that Munir and Co passed up. Enrique decided enough was enough, and brought on Neymar for the youngster.

The Brazilian almost had an instant impact, but was chopped down on the edge of the box. Then he lashed wide from 25 yards and would have been set for an easy tap-in, but for a rare misjudged ball by Andres Iniesta. Neymar recovered the loose ball and tried to find Messi, but the excellent Aymeric Laporte cut it out.

Excellent that is, until his poor pass straight to Sergio Busquets, which the midfielder fed to Messi. The Argentine looked up and split Athletic’s defence, leaving Neymar just to stroke it past Iraizoz.

Athletic hadn’t been able to muster much going forward, but Iker Muniain’s splendid dribble left Pique in a tangle, but the defender recovered his balance to deny the tricky forward. It was all they could offer, before Barcelona’s South Americans combined again to put the game out of reach.

A typically brilliant solo dribble by Messi took him into the box, before the Argentine flicked the ball back to Neymar. The Brazilian took a touch to steady himself, then another to plant the ball in the bottom right corner and settle the game.

While there is still more to come from Enrique’s Barcelona side, in terms of fluidity and attacking edge, he will be delighted with his 100 per cent record so far. And the clean sheet is their third from three La Liga games this season, matching a record they last achieved in 1993 – when their third game was also against Athletic Bilbao.
