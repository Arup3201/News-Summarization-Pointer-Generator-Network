Graphic video footage showing three Royal Marines allegedly murdering a wounded prisoner in Afghanistan will not be released because it could put the lives of British troops ‘at risk’, a judge ruled yesterday.

Judge Advocate Jeff Blackett said the ‘shocking’ DVD would be a propaganda gift to extremists and endanger UK service personnel and civilians.

The Daily Mail and other media organisations had asked that images of the Marines shooting the severely wounded insurgent - already played in open court - should be made available publicly.

But the judge ruled the video clips so disturbing it could be used to ‘incite attacks’ against British troops and members of the public.

Film footage showing the blood-stained detainee being dragged across a field in Helmand Province and shot at point blank range with a 9mm pistol in September 2011 was recorded by a camera mounted on the helmet of another marine.

It was discovered by police investigating war crimes a year later.

The marines, who can only be identified as A, B and C, are accused of ‘executing’ the stricken insurgent.

A court martial in Wiltshire has been told that Marine A killed the man with a bullet to the chest and was helped and encouraged by B and C. All three deny murder.

Arguing the video clips should not be released, senior Home Office counter-terrorism expert Paul Mott told Judge Blackett the images would go viral on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube within minutes.

He said: ‘I’ve seen nothing that surpasses it in terms of radicalisation potential. It’s exceptionally worrying, There’s nothing I have seen that matches its emotional power. It is a gift in propaganda terms.

‘I am confident that if made publicly available this footage would not only be used as propaganda material by terrorist organisations in order to radicalise others but would also be exploited by terrorist organisations to incite individuals to carry out terrorist acts.

‘Releasing it would therefore present a real threat to life for members of the armed forces and the wider British public and for British interests overseas.’

The video has already been played in open court. This sketch shows members of the Bulford Court Martial Board scrutinising the video clip last week

Mr Mott said footage of incidents such as the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq or US Marines urinating on dead insurgents in Afghanistan had been exploited by jihadists as propaganda.

Clare Kissin, barrister for the media organisations, said there was no evidence releasing the footage would pose a ‘real and immediate risk to life’.

She said there was a ‘clear public interest’ in publicising the images because it involved ‘serious and important questions about the action of service personnel in conflict zones'.

But in a written judgement, Judge Blackett said the DVD would ‘generate significant feelings of anger and revenge among certain people and will incite attacks on British service personnel at home and abroad’.

He said the principle of open justice was ‘immutable’. But he added: ‘It must be subject to exemptions particularly when dealing with threats posed by terrorist organisations which repeatedly attempt to radicalise people whom they can incite to commit atrocities.

‘Releasing it for unrestricted public consumption would expose British service personnel to increased risk of harm unnecessarily.

‘I am not prepared to ignore his [Mr Mott’s] very stark warning to put the lives of British service personnel at risk.’

The court martial continues.
