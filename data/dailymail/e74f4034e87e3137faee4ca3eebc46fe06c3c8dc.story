A city branded the Shark Attack Capital of The World has seen yet another two attacks – both on the same day.

A 15-year-old boy and a 29-year-old man were bitten in two separate incidents in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, on Sunday.

The two attacks this weekend takes this year’s shark bite toll to ten, Volusia County Beach officials said Monday.

The 15-year-old, from Maitland, Florida was bitten in the foot around 11am Sunday morning as he was surfing 100 yards off the shore.

About 30 minutes later, Kevin Ross, 29, was bitten about a mile down the coast form the first incident.

Ross, of Deltona, was able to identify the shark as a black-tip shark, estimating that it was around 4ft long.

‘I never, ever, thought I'd be attacked by a shark,’ Ross told MyFoxOrlando.

‘When it grabbed me, I was like “Oh my God, I'm going to die! This shark is about to eat me in the water!”’

Shark capital: New Smyrna Beach has more shark attacks per square mile than any other beach in the world

Fortunately Ross was able to make it back to shore and was taken to hospital by Volusia County Beach Patrol where he was given 30 stitches to his left foot.

Ross, of Deltona, was able to identify the shark as a black-tip shark, estimating that it was around 4ft long.

‘We do have a lot of bites in the area,’ Capt. Aaron Jenkins of Volusia County Beach Safety told ABC News.

‘It's because there are a lot of smaller sharks here.’

Jenkins added that although does not believe the same shark was responsible for both attacks, it could be the same species attracted by an increase in bait fish in the stretch of the beach popular among surfers.

New Smyrna Beach, a city of just over 22,900 people, has more incidents involving sharks and humans per square mile than any other beach in the world.

As a result, it has been named the Shark Attack Capital of the World by International Shark Attack File (ISAF).

In fact, it is estimated that a swimmer on New Smyrna Beach is within 10ft of a shark at any one time
