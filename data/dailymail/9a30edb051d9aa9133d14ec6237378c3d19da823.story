Milan has the worst traffic congestion of any city across Europe and North America, new data shows.

Although London and Los Angeles remain frighteningly bad for congestion and are among the top 10 worst offenders, Milan, Italy, took top spot.

Traffic data organisation INRIX used archived data to create a ranking of the worst cities and countries for traffic congestion.

It also as detailed the average number of hours spent waiting in traffic at each centre.

Drivers in London waste a staggering 83.4 hours a year in traffic - the worst of the top 25 cities.

Those in Los Angeles waste a slightly less shocking  64.3.

Drivers in Milan - the city ranked overall as the worst - only lose 57 hours a year.

INRIX used a detailed formula to produce its data that involved comparing a 'free flowing' speed on a particular segment of road to real time traffic speeds taken during peak hours.

Wasted driving minutes were created by placing wasted minutes in traffic against estimated typical trip lengths and the average number of trips taken each year.

In its findings, INRIX said after seven years of only 'modest' congestion, its 2013 report showed it was the same offenders topping the list.

'Simply put, it appears that congestion acted like a magnet - where it existed, it had a tendency to attract disproportionately more of it.

'Traffic is back on the rise in 2013, even in countries showing continued declines. Traffic congestion was up in six of the 15 countries analyzed: the U.S., UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Italy.'

And it is not good news for European drivers, with traffic congestion rising for the first time in two years.

'With traffic congestion increasing at 3 times the rate of employment, 10‐day long traffic jams like we've seen in China and the 2-3 hour daily commutes that are part of daily life for people in Sao Paolo, Brazil, today could become the reality for drivers in Europe and North America in the not so distant future.'

Brussels, in Belgium, was named the second worst city in Europe and North America for its terrible traffic congestion

Antwerp, Belgium (left) and Honolulu, Hawaii (right) were placed third and fourth respectively in the list which ranked all the major cities in Europe and North America

Los Angeles and London were fifth and sixth in the traffic congestion ranking - with London drivers thought to waste 83.4 hours a year navigating traffic

San Francisco was the second worst US city in the rankings pictured here as traffic tries to navigate the famous Golden Gate Bridge

Manchester, left, came eight on the rankings, while Paris, pictured as traffic circles its famed Arc De Triomphe, finished ninth

Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, came tenth and was the only Dutch city to feature on the list

The city of Austin in Texas, left, was particularly bad, while the pictured traffic island on Maid Marian Way in Nottingham can be terrible during rush hour - helping put Nottinghamshire eleventh on the list

The illuminated cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, left, looks pretty - but the traffic trying to navigate the streets below it is less appealing. The city came thirteenth on the list. Meanwhile this aerial view of Montreal, Canada, pictured right, shows why the city came fourteenth on the rankings

Liverpool was the next UK city to make the list - the home of the Beatles is also home to terrible traffic congestion

It comes as no surprise New York is on the rankings - placed sixteenth - the grid lock traffic in downtown is synonymous with the Big Apple

Next on the list was US city Bridgeport, in Connecticut, which was seveteenth, while Stuttgart, in Germany followed closely behind it in eighteenth position

Birmingham, left, and the famous Silicon Valley's San Jose, right, rounded out the top 20 worst congested cities, placing ninteenth and twentieth respectively
