While Diego Costa has grabbed headlines aplenty with his goals and robust style since joining Chelsea, it's another summer acquisition from Spain who has helped Jose Mourinho's side really tick so far this season.

Not only did Cesc Fabregas' £30million move from Barcelona leave Arsenal fans in uproar, it also made a significant section of the Stamford Bridge faithful question their manager.

The Spaniard's talent was never an issue, but how could they welcome a player with such strong connections to their London rivals into Mourinho's tight-knit camp?

Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea) - 13

Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea) - 8

Leighton Baines (Everton) - 7

Dusan Tadic (Southampton) - 7

Stewart Downing (West Ham) - 6

Angel di Maria (Manchester United) - 6

Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) - 6

Jesus Navas (Manchester City) - 6 

Fast forward five months and any doubts about Fabregas - or his commitment - have been well and truly banished after the Blues' brilliant first half of the campaign.

Chelsea are three points clear at the top of the Premier League and have scored the joint highest amount of goals - two things Fabregas can take a huge amount of credit for.

After picking a pass to Eden Hazard for the Belgian to equalise against Southampton on Sunday, the 27-year-old now has 13 assists in the top-flight this season.

Not only is that the highest amount in the division, it's also five more than second-placed Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea.

Former Barcelona midfielder Fabregas has also created more chances than any other player this season

Cesc Fabregas - 61

Stewart Downing - 54

Alexis Sanchez - 51

Dusan Tadic - 50

Eden Hazard - 47

Raheem Sterling - 45

Christian Eriksen - 44

Gylfi Sigurdsson - 42

Santi Cazorla - 42

Jesus Navas - 41

Everton's Leighton Baines and Southampton's Dusan Tadic share third place with seven assists to their names, but both are a long way behind the Spain midfielder.

It would be easy to assume that Fabregas has more assists because he is setting up the likes of £32m man Costa, however the numbers prove otherwise.

Fabregas has created 61 chances (including assists) this season - seven more than second-placed Stewart Downing and 10 more than Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez.

He is making an average of 3.33 scoring opportunities per 90 minutes since moving to Stamford Bridge, showing a staggering consistency to his game across the opening 19 fixtures.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard managed a league high of 13 assists during the 2013-14 campaign but Fabregas has already equalled that tally and we're only halfway through the season.

One more and he'll jump into a tie for sixth on the all-time list of Premier League assist-makers alongside the likes of Ashley Young, David Beckham and Didier Drogba.

But Fabregas won't be content with that. Thierry Henry's record of 20 assists - set for Arsenal during the 2002-03 season - is well within his reach.

The Frenchman's total has stood untouched for over a decade but his former team-mate has the skill, experience and vision to smash it to pieces.

In fact, if Fabregas goes on to create goals at the same rate until May, he will end up with 26 assists for the season.

Costa can expect more goals and attention if his team-mate continues his current form, but it'll be Fabregas who goes down as Mourinho's most influential signing of last summer.
