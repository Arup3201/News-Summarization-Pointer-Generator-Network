Borussia Dortmund eased past Galatasaray to continue their 100% record in this season's Champions League group stages.

A brace from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, followed by goals from Marco Reus and Adrian Ramos, secured the points and took Dortmund three clear of Arsenal in Group D. 

The Gunners came from behind in Brussels to steal a late, vital 2-1 win against Anderlecht, with goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski. Their victory means they stay relatively close to Dortmund, but it is the Germans who look the most fearful in this group.

In Turkey, Dortmund did not have to wait long to take the lead, when Aubameyang tucked away a Marco Reus cross with ease to put the away side ahead after just six minutes.

The German's have struggled in their Bundesliga campaign, winning just two of their first eight matches, but they are having no such trouble on the European stage. 

To compound Galatasaray's misery early on, Aubameyang doubled both his tally and his side's lead with Dortmund's second after 16 minutes. 

Latching onto Lukasz Piszczek's inch-perfect cross, the Gabon international finished with relative ease to take the game further from the home side's reach.

Marco Reus continued the rout four minutes before the break, when he hammered home a wonderful strike from 25 yards out. The goalkeeping was questionable from Galatasaray stopper Fernando Muslera, but to take anything away from Reus' effort would be an injustice. 

In the second-half, Dortmund continued their impressive performance, albeit at a slower pace than the first. 

Shinji Kagawa was injured with 10 minutes to play, and was replaced by Adrian Ramos. The Columbian scored twice in Dortmund's 3-0 win over Anderlecht, and took less than a minute to get on the scoresheet again.

The fourth goal completed Dortmund's easy win, and they will be confident of progressing in first place from Group D.
