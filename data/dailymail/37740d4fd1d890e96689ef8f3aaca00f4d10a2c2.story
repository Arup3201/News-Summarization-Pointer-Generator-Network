Two boys found fatally shot in Utah basement earlier in November died in a murder-suicide, police revealed on Friday.

The autopsy in the horrific case showed that Dayton Gessell, 15, shot Taylor Wheeler, 12, once in the head before turning the gun on himself.

But police in South Jordan, Utah, still don't know whether the deaths were intentional or part of a tragic accident.

Tragic: Police think that that  Dayton Gessell, 15, right, fatally shot Taylor Wheeler, 12, left, before turning the gun on himself in South Jordan, Utah

'At this point we don't know if it 
was intentional or accidental, that's part of the investigative 
process,' said South Jordan Police Sergeant Sam Winkler, as reported by the Deseret News.

The two boys were found dead in the basement of a home on November 15 with three handguns surrounding their lifeless bodies.

Friends Wheeler and Gessell and were discovered minutes after gunshots rang out in the Daybreak suburb of South Jordan. Neither
boy lived at the residence.

Three other teenagers, including two brothers - aged 16, 14, and 14 - were in the house when the shots were fired.

Mystery: Neither Taylor, pictured, or Dayton lived in the Daybreak home, and police say the investigation is ongoing

Guns: Authorities have been unable to confirm where the three guns found near the bodies of Dayton, left, and Taylor, right, came from, who owns them and even if they were used in the shooting

Winkler said that the three had been 
fingerprinted, photographed and swabbed for DNA samples. The older boy 
has also been interviewed.

South Jordan Police emphasized that this case is still on 'ongoing' and a 'very active investigation.'

Authorities
are still awaiting the final medical examiner's report, the toxicology 
report, ballistics report and will conduct more interviews

'This
is a tragedy. The family's devastated. We really don't have any words 
to say. It's hard, very hard. These kids were so young with so much life
ahead of them,' Shawn Graham, Dayton's uncle, told the Deseret News.

An
off duty policeman driving by the home discovered the Copper Mountain 
Middle School students' bodies at around 4:30 p.m. after another boy who
was at the residence at the time ran onto the street and waved him 
down.

Scene: The boys were found dead in the basement of 4781 W. Pine Canyon Way, pictured in the Daybreak community of South Jordan, Utah. Neither boy lived at the home

Family: Taylor's mother Charle Meier and her two daughters attend a candlelight vigil on November 15 to pay respects to the boys

Authorities have been unable to confirm where the guns came from, who owns them and even if they were used in the shooting.

The boys' family and friends held a vigil for them Sunday night and more than 100 people turned out to remember the students and support their loved ones.

Dayton was described as an incredible young man who loved baseball and wanted to be an engineer.

While Taylor was a fun-loving kid who enjoyed making people laugh.

Taylor's friend Drew Francom left a dollar bill on a picnic table for his pal.

He said he was looking for change recently and asked Taylor, but at the moment the boy did not have money. Then later at lunch, Taylor found Drew again and gave him the dollar he needed.

Respects: Kendyll Stewart, left, is comforted by Tayler Nicole, as they attend a candlelight vigil on Sunday, November 17, 2013, in memory of Taylor Wheeler and Dayton Gessell

'I never got to pay him back,' Francom said. 'So I brought him a dollar.'

Graham said his nephew was clever and had an exciting future ahead of him.

'(Dayton) was amazing with math. You could throw him a math problem and he didn't have to write it down. He could just hammer it out,' he said.

Taylor's mother, Charlé Meier, told the Salt Lake Tribune the vigil was important because everyone who knew and loved her son and Dayton needed somewhere to be together and deal with the sudden loss.

Crying, and holding her two daughters close, she said: 'We're lighting candles for lights extinguished too soon. They were just boys.'

Later, Meier stood on a picnic table and passed around notebooks so people could write down messages for the boys. 'Nobody got to say goodbye,' she said.
