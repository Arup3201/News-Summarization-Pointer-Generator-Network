The early hours of November 4, 1902, and Police Constable No. 472 of the St Pancras Police Division was walking his beat in the mean streets around St Pancras station in London. He had just turned into Weirs Passage, an unlit alley off Chalton Street, when he heard a faint cry.

Flashing his torch, he realised that the noise came from a bundle of rags left on the freezing pavement. When he bent down to investigate, he saw that the bundle contained a baby boy.

That foundling grew up to be my grand-father. In old age, he wrote a vivid fragment of childhood memoir, recording everything he knew about the remarkable journey that began — and almost ended — on the London streets that cold winter night.

It was the early 20th century and Somers Town — the area around St Pancras — was a slum district, home to the rackety street life that accumulates in places where people are constantly on their way to somewhere else.

In the middle of Somers Town stood the St Pancras Workhouse, and it was there that the foundling was taken. He was arbitrarily assigned a birthday of May 1, 1902, baptised Percy Chalton after the street where he was found (his surname was later altered to Charlton) and despatched to an orphanage at Leavesden, near Watford.

That first Christmas in the orphanage was one of many lonely childhood Christmases he would spend in institutions or foster care with people who treated him unkindly, until at last his fortunes took a happier turn.

His memories of childhood began at the orphanage. The first thing he could recall was being roughly bathed by a nursemaid who threatened to fill his mouth with soap if he didn’t stop crying for his favourite nurse, Hetty. She was, he wrote later, ‘my first friend, and I often remembered her kindness in my small world of unkindness’.

When Percy was five years old, he was sent to board with foster parents in the Essex village of Hatfield Broad Oak. Back then, there were no particular qualifications for being a foster parent. Any married couple or ‘respectable widow’ could apply, as long as they were recommended by a Church of England clergyman.

A weekly payment of four shillings was a powerful incentive to foster a child at a time when a farm labourer earned around 14 shillings a week.

Percy’s first impressions of his foster mother were not encouraging. ‘The very size of her, together with her dress and appearance, was forbidding and frightening,’ he wrote. Bewildered and miserable, he sobbed as he followed this terrifying person to the cottage that was to be his new home.

The house was small, with a living room and scullery on the ground floor, two bedrooms on the first floor — where his foster mother, her meek husband and their three children, Arthur, John and Dorothy, slept — and a little attic bedroom where Percy was quartered.

The floor was bare boards, the only light came from a small latticed window on the landing, and the eaves sloped so sharply that he could reach out and touch them as he lay in bed. All his life, Percy suffered from nightmares of being crushed, which he was convinced came from being confined in this cramped room. His forebodings about his foster mother proved cruelly justified. With a reputation in the village as a shrew and a scold, she bullied her husband and children — but reserved her worst unkindness for her orphan foster son.

When he tried to dispose of the disgusting boiled-suet pudding she dished up every Monday by hiding it in his pockets, she sewed them up. She dosed him forcibly with laxatives and beat him with a stick that hung on the kitchen wall. When her husband tried to protect the child, she beat him as well.

When the couple’s eldest son, Arthur, died of pneumonia, things became even harsher. Percy’s foster mother seemed to blame him for being alive while Arthur was dead.

Percy was no longer allowed to play with his foster siblings, forbidden even to speak to them and eventually banished from the family table at mealtimes. Instead, he had to eat standing up in the pantry, using the mangle as a table.

The worst thing of all, he remembered, was being made to hand back his Scout uniform within an hour of getting it. It had been given to him by the local vicar, and Percy wore it home proudly, but his foster mother — who seemed to loathe anything that made him happy — forced him to take it off. She then bundled it into a parcel and told him to return it to the vicarage.

That final cruelty turned into one of the rare strokes of good fortune that changed the direction of my grandfather’s life.

The vicar of St Mary’s, Hatfield, was Canon Francis W. Galpin, a kind, cultivated man who was an expert in church music. Percy had a good treble voice and sang in the church choir. When he arrived, disconsolate, to return his Scout uniform, Canon Galpin decided that something must be done.

He was one of three boys in his year selected to take the scholarship exam for Bishop’s Stortford Grammar School, although he was successful it was decided that Percy's (pictured) future lay in the Royal Navy.

He arranged for Percy to move to a different foster home with Julia Burton, the village postmistress. She had married a soldier who fought in the Boer War but he was killed in an accident within a few months of the wedding and she brought up their son alone, with a succession of foster children.

She was brave, hard-working and kind, and my grandfather stayed in touch with her until the end of her long life. She is there in his wedding photos — a sweet-faced woman in a cloche hat — and I have a faint childhood memory of visiting a very old lady in a black dress, who sat very upright in a high-backed chair beneath a stained-glass window.

For the first time in his life, Percy learned what it was to be an ordinary boy in a pre-war village in rural Essex.

He went fishing for sticklebacks, keeping a sharp look-out for the big pike that was said to lurk in the stream and attack small boys. He rode the roundabouts at the village fair, where he marvelled at the strong man and the bearded lady. He carried stone gallon jars of beer to the farm-workers at harvest-time, and earned halfpennies to spend on bags of broken biscuits by helping the old man who wound the church clock.

When Percy married Ethel Rose, he gained a family at last — she was the youngest of 13 children of a London publican and his wife (pictured here on their wedding day) 

He was a bright little boy, and although his ill-treatment in his first foster home had left him with a crippling stammer, he thrived at school. He was one of three boys in his year to take the scholarship exam for Bishop’s Stortford Grammar School.

All three were successful but the Board of Guardians of St Pancras Workhouse — shadowy figures who still had the power to decide Percy’s fate — concluded that he wasn’t eligible to accept the scholarship.

Instead they decided that his future lay in the Royal Navy.

More than 50 years later, my grandfather wrote: ‘I don’t remember being very sorry for myself at the news. The fact that I was to leave the village was itself a matter of great excitement and yearning. I was perhaps conscious that there were better things elsewhere.’

In earlier moments of despair, he added, he had often thought of running away to sea. The event that really troubled him came two years later. Before joining the Navy he was required to swear his age before a local magistrate. He was given an envelope to hand to the magistrate, and when he looked at the documents inside, Percy had a huge shock.

Percy's story is one of sadness and hardship but also courage and resilience. He is pictured here with his wife Ethel and their two granddaughters

He’d always thought that his parents had given him up to an orphanage. No one had explained that he was a foundling — with no family at all.

‘I’d always hoped that one day I would be reunited with my real father and mother, and perhaps with brothers and sisters,’ he wrote. ‘I was more conscious than ever of being alone.’

It wasn’t until I had a baby of my own that I realised there was an even more poignant layer of sadness to his story.

The truth is that my grandfather wasn’t a newborn when he was found but a healthy baby of about six months. For half a year, someone had taken good care of him before some desperate circumstance forced her to conclude he would be better off lying on the cold ground in a dark alley on a winter’s night than staying with her.

But if my grandfather’s story is one of hardship, cruelty and loss, it is also one of courage, resilience and cheerfulness.

After joining the Navy as a boy sailor, he retired at the commissioned rank of Lieutenant Commander. He missed World War I by a month but served on convoys during World War II and was mentioned in despatches.

And when he married my grandmother, Ethel Rose, he gained a family at last — she was the youngest of 13 children of a London publican and his wife.

Percy and Ethel had a daughter and two granddaughters — my sister and me.

And some of my happiest childhood memories are of sitting with him at this time of year, listening to his stories of when he was a little boy — all alone in the world and dreaming of running away to sea.
