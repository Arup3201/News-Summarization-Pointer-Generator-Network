Stuart Pearce describes vacancy as 'outstanding' opportunity

Neil Warnock has backed Gianfranco Zola to take over the Nottingham Forest manager’s job - and also endorsed Stuart Pearce.

The former QPR, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United boss ruled himself out of the position after claiming there was ‘certain criteria’ he could not adhere to.

Zola is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed sacked Billy Davies and Sportsmail understands contact has been made with the Italian, who stepped down at Watford in December.

But where Warnock’s deal was believed to be on a short-term basis with the aim of getting Forest promoted to the Barclays Premier League this season, any deal for Zola would more likely be longer term.

Pearce, who spent 12 years at the club mostly as captain, is second-favourite to take the job with bookies and would be a winner with the fans. Warnock described him as an ‘ideal’ candidate on talkSPORT and Pearce himself called the job an ‘outstanding’ opportunity.

Warnock turned down the job after failing to agree terms with owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi. It is understood the Kuwaiti indicated he wanted influence on starting line-ups with particular focus on Algerian duo Rafik Djebbour and Djamel Abdoun.

Warnock told talkSPORT: ‘I am sure someone like Zola, who will come in and just coach the team, will end up there.

‘In
 my mind I knew my starting line-up, so if I can't 100 per cent go into 
it knowing that I'm not going to be able to manage as I manage then I 
can't commit myself.

‘In the end it just didn't add up to me. I thought I'd be doing it for the wrong reasons. It wasn't the financial part of it.

‘That's
 why I think Zola will be the favourite because if you remember he was 
given players [at Watford] and it worked for a while.

‘Stuart with his contacts - perhaps he would work with Zola. He is an icon at the club. Stuart, I think, would be ideal.’

Warnock
 added: ‘There was nobody you could talk to at the club English-wise 
that knew about football; that you could have a conversation about 
getting things done.

‘They've
 got to alter that issue. You've got to know the rules and regulations. 
It just seemed very difficult to get things done at the club.’

Pearce, also speaking to talkSPORT,
 said: ‘There are some really good jobs out there at times.

'Nottingham 
Forest outside the Premier League is an outstanding job for whatever 
manager wants it.’

Asked
 about the potential involvement from Al-Hasawi the former England Under
 21s manager said: ‘It depends what type of manager you are. Foreign 
owners are very prevalent around the English game now.

‘As
 a manager you have to define what you think is acceptable. I would have
 thought there are certain things any manager wouldn’t accept and that’s
 the picking of the team and players coming through the door being 
signed by somebody else that you don’t want. They are probably the two 
golden rules.

‘But some 
managers are different. It depends how desperate for a job you are. Some
 would want total control. It’s varying degrees.

‘I’m
 not sure which way they will go. That’s down to the owner. They have 
got their feelers out at the club and they will identify somebody that 
will do the job well.

'Gary Brazil has got the opportunity to showcase 
himself.’

European Cup winner Garry Birtles, meanwhile, welcomed the sacking of Davies and called on Al-Hasawi to appoint a manager who would restore the reputation of the club.

‘Billy Davies was dragging the club that Brian Clough and Peter Taylor turned into what it is into the gutter,’ said Birtles. ‘It’s a club that has got a good history and it needs propping up again.’

He would like to see Nigel Clough follow in his father’s footsteps.

‘I know from first-hand how Nigel does it. I used to go to the training ground at Derby and it was a happy place to be. He gets the place bright and vibrant and enjoying things.’

Meanwhile, former captain John McGovern has taken on an ambassadorial role with the club.
