Residents were evacuated from a unit block in Sydney's eastern suburbs after an overloaded power board which was resting on top of a pile of clothes caught fire.

Fire and rescue workers were called to the four-unit block in Randwick at 6.43pm on Tuesday night where they extinguished the blaze.

Firefighter Nicolas McGuiggan, who attended the scene, said the fire broke out in a male tenant's bedroom in Unit Four where there was a laptop, mobile phone and other personal electrical items.

The incident was cause by an overloaded power board resting on a pile of clothes which caught fire

Six people were evacuated safely from the block and one was treated for smoke inhalation by an ambulance

'The tenant had a laptop and a few other electrical devices plugged in and charging,' Mr McGuiggan said.

'There was a large amount of personal belongings in the room, clothes, so we believe he'd run a lead and piggybacked another lead and power board off that and it was resting on an external clothes wardrobe.

'We believe heat from that into the clothes has gotten the fire started.'

A NSW Fire and Rescue spokeswoman said the incident served as a warning not to overload power boards, especially in winter.

This comes after a 28-year-old woman died and a 13-year-old boy was injured by electric shocks from faulty USB chargers - sparking warnings from NSW Fair Trading about the dangerous items and the businesses that stock them.

The residents were not able to stay in the block overnight over fears the roof may collapse

Mr McGuiggan said the man whose unit burned down was home at the time.

'The resident heard some noise, didn't think it was anything and it wasn't until he went back to his lounge room and saw some smoke coming out of his ceiling and he went back to his bedroom and saw it on fire,' he said.

'He quickly closed the door to the room and notified all the other residents and they all evacuated.'

Six people were evacuated safely from the block and one was treated for smoke inhalation by an ambulance.

Unit Four's second bedroom was totally destroyed by fire, the living room suffered smoke damage and the rest of the unit suffered water damage.

There was smoke damage in Unit Three and Unit One was not damaged.

The residents were not able to stay in the block overnight over fears the roof may collapse.

'The fire had got into the common roof void area so we were worried about roof tiles and the roof collapsing into Unit Four,' Mr McGuiggan said.
