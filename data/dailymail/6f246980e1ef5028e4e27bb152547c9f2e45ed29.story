Are you someone who posts a status or photo on Facebook, then checks the site every minute to see how many likes and comments you have?

If so, chances are you're insecure in your relationships  - and you require attention from others to feel better.

That's according to a study that found people who had a fear of rejection typically spent more time 'feedback seeking' on the social network.

A study by Union College in New York found anxious and insecure people spend more time 'feedback seeking' on Facebook (stock image shown). They are more likely to post statuses and check for likes and comments. This is done in the hope of getting attention due to a fear of rejection

The study was carried out by researchers at Union College in Schenectady, New York and published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.

It suggests that people who are generally insecure in their relationships are more actively engaged on the social media site - frequently posting on walls, commenting, updating their status or 'liking' something - in the hope of getting attention.

Selfies and self-indulgent Facebook statuses suggest we are more narcissistic than ever.

But researchers have found we actually started to become increasingly self-centred more than 100 years ago.

By studying unique baby names, birth and divorce rates and the use of words like 'I' and 'me' in books, the experts said individualism began rising at the turn of the 20th century.

And this rise is blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs as people became wealthier and better educated.

Individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole. It is said to have first developed among Baby Boomers, born after WWII.

The study covered a 150-year period and was carried out by researchers from the Department of Psychology at the University of Waterloo and Arizona State University. 

In two surveys of almost 600 people aged 18 to 83, the researchers at Union College asked participants about their tendencies in close relationships, and their Facebook habits.

The results suggest there are at least two kinds of active Facebook users.

These are people who are higher in attachment anxiety, and people who are higher in extraversion.

People who were higher in attachment anxiety worry that other people don't love them as much as they want to be loved, according to the researchers, and are chronically concerned about rejection and abandonment.

They reported greater amounts of what the study refers to as 'feedback seeking' on Facebook.

Because these people need a lot of reassurance they are loved, and are very sensitive to other people's opinions about them, they turn to Facebook for feedback.

'Compared to more secure people, those higher in attachment anxiety are more feedback sensitive,' said Dr Joshua Hart, associate professor of psychology and the lead author of the study.

'They report feeling much better about themselves when they get a lot of comments, likes and other feedback on their posts and worse about themselves when their Facebook activity generates little attention.'

Do you find yourself checking the site every few minutes? In the study, anxious and insecure people reported feeling much better when others commented or liked on their Facebook activity. 'Compared to more secure people, those higher in attachment anxiety are more feedback sensitive,' said lead author Dr Joshua Hart

Anxiously attached individuals' level of feedback sensitivity correlates with how active they are on Facebook, Dr Hart said, 'and it appears that this strategy may work: they report receiving more attention than people lower in attachment anxiety.'

Dr Hart's co-authors were Dr George Bizer, professor of psychology at Union, and former students Elizabeth Nailling and Caitlyn Collins.

Previous research on the relation between personality and styles of engagement with social media is limited and has generated mixed results.

The current study is one of the first to examine the reasons people turn to Facebook and the kind of engagement they exhibit as a function of their personality style. 

'These studies are consistent with many people's intuitions that some individuals use Facebook to fulfill emotional and relationship needs that are unmet in the "real" world,' Dr Hart said.

'There is a robust debate playing out in psychological science and pop culture as to whether Facebook represents a healthy or unhealthy outlet for such needs.

'I think the jury's still out on that, but this research suggests that personality is an important factor to consider when investigating the causes and consequences of people's engagement with social media.'
