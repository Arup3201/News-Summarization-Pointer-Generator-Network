In a critical climate indicator showing an ever warming world, the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean has shrunk to an all time low.

The shocking new figures reveal the ice has halved in size since the 1980s.

'We are now in uncharted territory,' said snow and ice data center director Mark Serreze.

New images Nasa show reveal the full extent of Arctic ice shrinkage, showing a new record low compared to the average minimum extent over the past 30 years (in yellow).

'While weâ€™ve long known that as the planet warms up, changes would be 
seen first and be most pronounced in the Arctic, few of us 
were prepared for how rapidly the changes would actually occur.'

The ice cap at the North Pole measured 1.32 million square miles on Sunday, according to the new data released today.

Scientists say this is 18 percent smaller than the previous record of 1.61 million square miles set in 2007, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo.

Records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking.

'On top of that, we're smashing a record that smashed a record,' said data center scientist Walt Meier. Sea ice shrank in 2007 to levels 22 percent below the previous record of 2005.

Ice in the Arctic melts in summer and grows in winter, and it started growing again on Monday.

In the 1980s, Meier said, summer sea ice would cover an area slightly smaller than the Lower 48 states.

Now it is about half that.

Man-made global warming has melted more sea ice and made it thinner over the last couple decades with it getting much more extreme this year, surprisingly so,

'Recently the loss of summer ice has accelerated and the six lowest September ice extents have all been in the past six years,' Serreze said. 'I think that's quite remarkable.'

Serreze said except for one strong storm that contributed to the ice loss, this summer melt was more from the steady effects of day-to-day global warming.

Scattered ice floes are seen from the bridge of the RV Healy on August 20, 2012 northwest of Barrow, Alaska.

The U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center shows the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic on Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2012, at center in white, and the 1979 to 2000 average extent for the day shown, with the orange line.

But he and others say the polar regions are where the globe first sees the signs of climate change.

'Arctic sea ice is one of the most sensitive of nature's thermometers,' said Jason Box, an Ohio State University polar researcher.

What happens in the Arctic changes climate all over the rest of the world, scientists have reported in studies.

The ice in the Arctic 'essentially acts like an air conditioner by keeping things cooler,' Meier said.

'And when sea ice melts more, it's like the air conditioner isn't running efficiently,' he said.

Sea ice reflects more than 90 percent of the sun's heat off the Earth, but when it is replaced by the darker open ocean, more than half of the heat is absorbed into the water, Meier said.

Scientists at the snow and ice data center said their computer models show an Arctic that would be essentially free of ice in the summer by 2050, but they add that current trends show ice melting faster than the computers are predicting.

'Climate models have predicted a retreat of the Arctic sea ice; but the actual retreat has proven to be much more rapid than the predictions,' said Claire Parkinson, a climate scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.

'There continues to be considerable inter-annual variability in the sea ice cover, but the long-term retreat is quite apparent.'

The thickness of the ice cover is also in decline.

'The core of the ice cap is the perennial ice, which normally survived the summer because it was so thick', said Joey Comiso, senior scientist with NASA Goddard.

'But because it's been thinning year after year, it has now become vulnerable to melt.'

The disappearing older ice gets replaced in winter with thinner seasonal ice that usually melts completely in the summer.

This year, a powerful cyclone formed off the coast of Alaska and moved on Aug. 5 to the center of the Arctic Ocean, where it churned the weakened ice cover for several days.

The storm cut off a large section of sea ice north of the Chukchi Sea and pushed it south to warmer waters that made it melt entirely.

It also broke vast extensions of ice into smaller pieces more likely to melt.'The storm definitely seems to have played a role in this year's unusually large retreat of the ice", Parkinson said.

'But that exact same storm, had it occurred decades ago when the ice was thicker and more extensive, likely wouldn't have had as prominent an impact, because the ice wasn't as vulnerable then as it is now.'
