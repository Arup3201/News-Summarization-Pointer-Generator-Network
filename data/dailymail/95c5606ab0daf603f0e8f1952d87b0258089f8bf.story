The 18-year-old accused of fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death at their high school had been arrested just days before the brutal attack for allegedly making criminal threats.

Abraham Lopez, 18, repeatedly stabbed Cindi 
Santana, 17, at South East High School in South Gate, California, during a lunchtime fight after punching her and pushing her to the ground.

She died in hospital hours later.

CBS reported that Lopez was arrested on September 25 but was bailed out two days later.

It was unclear whether or not this arrest was in connection with his ex-girlfriend.

After he allegedly stabbed Cindi Santana, he caused a hospital bomb scare by saying he had hidden explosive devices there.

Shock: Friend Danielle Mendoza was with Cindi when she died and said she told her she 'wasn't ready to go'

Investigators thought he could have 
planted explosives in the vehicle of the girl's family - parked in a 
garage at the hospital where she died.

The
hospital was briefly locked down on Friday night while a sheriff's bomb
squad searched the car but they found nothing, Los Angeles Unified School District police chief Steve Zipperman said.

Friends and classmates of the 17-year-old senior gathered at the school on Saturday evening, where a memorial was growing.

A friend of Cindi's, Danielle 
Mendoza, who was with her when she died, told CBS: 'I was telling her 
just "close your eyes and pray with me". She was just like, "I’m not 
ready to go", and she was crying.

'She was saying that "it hurts so much" and he was basically screaming out, "I loved you".'

He stabbed her several times before being subdued by a school official, policeman and a student, who all suffered minor injuries, authorities said.

Chief Zipperman said a school dean tried to intervene and realised Lopez had a knife.

Response: Lopez allegedly began arguing with her during a lunch break - and later caused a bomb scare by saying he had hidden explosive devices

He was also injured.

Lopez allegedly told detectives he 
had placed explosive devices in several places. Another team searched 
the family's home and found nothing.

The girl died at a hospital in 
Lynwood, California, after surgery. Lopez is in police custody and is 
expected to appear in court on Tuesday.

‘This is our bread and butter, the safety and security of our students,’ Chief Zipperman told KCAL-TV.

‘It's difficult to understand if 
somebody gets stabbed, but then when we lose a student as a result of 
that, let's face it - there isn't anything worse.’

Lopez was taken to a hospital to 
ensure he was not injured during his arrest. He was being held on 
suspicion of murder on $1million bail.

Grief counsellors were made available
to students at the school, Los Angeles Unified School District 
Superintendent John Deasy said.
