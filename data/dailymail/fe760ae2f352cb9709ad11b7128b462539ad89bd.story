A bus driver murdered his 12-year-old stepdaughter after becoming frustrated at not being able to get out of an arranged marriage with her mother.

David Hang, 43, was yesterday convicted of stabbing Jessica Nguyen more than 40 times with a machete at the family home in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in May last year.

He had married her Vietnamese mother, Kim Vu, so that she could get U.S. citizenship, the prosecution told Montgomery County Circuit Court.

But he met another woman and wanted to end his sham marriage, a request that Vu and her relatives refused.

State attorney John McCarthy said: 
'The family would not let him out of the marriage as soon as he wanted. 
He let it be known he would get revenge.'

Hang took out his anger and frustration on Jessica, stabbing her 43 times with a small sword on May 31, 2011.

A knife case with his DNA on it was 
found beside her body in the basement of the family home. The knife was 
never found, reports MyFoxDC.com.

Mr McCarthy said: 'This was clearly 
premeditated. We'll be seeking a sentence of life without parole. We 
think he should die in prison for this crime.'

Hang had wanted to get medical insurance for his new partner but was unable to do so while married to Vu.

His lawyer told the court that he was at a doctor's appointment in Virginia with his girlfriend at the time of the murder.

Brian Shefferman suggested Jessica could have been killed by a burglar or a pervert.

He said: 'David Hang is not the right
person. He did not commit the crime. He had no reason to harm Jessica 
Nguyen. He did not harm Jessica Nguyen.'

But the court was shown mobile phone records that indicated Hang was near the murder scene at the time.

During his closing argument, prosecutor Stephen Chaikin showed the jury photographs of Jessica's mutilated body.

He told the jury: 'This was personal. Hold this monster accountable.'

Speaking outside court, Jessica's 
relative Hoa Dinh said: 'Even though it won't bring Jessica back to us, 
we are grateful to know David Hang will never get out of prison, and he 
can't hurt the community.'

Hang will be sentenced on October 29.
