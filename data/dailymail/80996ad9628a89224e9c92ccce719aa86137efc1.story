Remember learning to suck milkshake through a straw for the first time? Or when you first got the hang of blowing bubbles in the bath? The sensation is no different for a baby elephant.

An adorable two-week old elephant calf at Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, Arizona, is at that very stage now as she learns to use her trunk, with her latest trick being to playfully blow bubbles in the water.

 Reid Park Zoo can be found on Facebook and at their website.

'Like this, mummy?' The two-week-old elephant calf experiments by plunging her trunk into the water

When they are first born baby elephants don't really know what to do with their trunks - apart from swing them to and fro a bit and sometimes step on them. 

Many elephant babies suck their trunk just like human babies suck their thumb, and usually it takes until six to eight months they can use their trunks to eat and drink. So this baby girl elephant must be quite precocious. 

The video from the zoo, which is documenting every stage of the as-yet-unnamed girl's development on its website, shows her with Semba and a tub of water as she makes short work of using her trunk to suck up water and blow bubbles, her ears flapping madly as she plays.

Swirling the water and sucking it up then blowing produces some interesting results...
