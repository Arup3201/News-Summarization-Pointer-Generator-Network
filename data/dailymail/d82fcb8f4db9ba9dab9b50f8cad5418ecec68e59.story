He can go days without using his mobile phone and admits that he isn’t much of a talker. 

So imagine Robert Shadwick’s shock when he received a mobile bill for £1,046 – as his operator insisted he had been chatting on a single call for 43 hours straight.

Mobile phone company EE blocked the 65-year-old from using his phone and even tried to take the money from his bank account by direct debit.

Shock: Robert Shadwick received a mobile bill for £1,046, with his operator claiming he made a single phone call lasting nearly two days. EE then tried to take the money from his bank account

Mr Shadwick, a grandfather and retired job centre adviser, said: ‘I was absolutely shocked. When I called EE they said I had made a 43-hour phone call.

‘To do that I would have had to go without sleep for two days, which is obviously ridiculous.

‘I asked for the service to be restored but the firm refused.’

The problem was caused by a call he made with his EE phone to mobile operator 3 on May 10. 

Mr Shadwick, from Rotherham in South Yorkshire, was checking when the contract on his second phone expired and the call lasted about ten minutes. Ironically, if he had used his 3 phone to make the call it would have been free.

He believes that either he or 3 failed to hang up properly at the end of the brief chat. He didn’t use his mobile for another two days, and when he eventually tried there was a message telling him he could not continue.

Mr Shadwick, who has a £10 monthly contract which usually covers his needs, said: ‘I’m not very good with mobile phones but I couldn’t understand how there could possibly be a problem because I never get anywhere near the monthly limit on calls that I am allowed.

‘I told my son, who used to be a manager with a mobile phone company, and he called EE on my behalf. When he said I owed more than £1,000 I was shocked. '

'He disputed the amount and the company said it would be investigated. Over the next ten days or so I made several calls to ask how this could be but each time they insisted I owed the money. They said it had to be paid.’ 

Mr Shadwick checked his bank account online and saw that rather than pausing his direct debit payment while the bill was being investigated, EE was due to take the full amount out. He got the payment stopped.

‘I pay all my bills on time and I have never been in debt,’ he said. ‘I have asked so many times, “Why would I make such a long call?” Whenever I spoke to anyone I got sympathy but no action.’ 

His phone log did show a call lasting 43 hours, but he believes there should have been an automatic disconnection.

As the dispute continued he even got a text stating ‘We’re glad we’ve solved your problem’ – although his phone was still blocked.

It took ten days and the intervention of his local newspaper before EE waived the four-figure bill and reconnected his phone.

He said in the end EE ‘seemed to accept the logic that I couldn’t possibly have been on the phone for that long’.

A spokesman for EE described the case as ‘highly unusual’ and added: ‘Due to exceptional circumstances we have waived all charges for the call and reconnected the phone. The customer is happy with this resolution.’
