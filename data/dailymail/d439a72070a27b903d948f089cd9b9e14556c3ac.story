 

The U.S. military and its allies hit Islamic State forces with 15 air strikes in Iraq and Syria during a three-day period, the U.S. Central Command revealed today.

Thirteen attacks were carried out in Iraq since Wednesday and two more targeted Islamic State in Syria.

The air strikes in Syria hit an Islamic State fighting position and staging area near Kobani and a tactical unit near Aleppo, Central Command said.

In Iraq, bunkers, vehicles, a bulldozer and a fighting position were destroyed near Kirkuk and a large unit and four tactical units also were hit in five air strikes.

Near Mosul, two raids destroyed vehicles and a heavy weapon while another tactical unit was hit near Ramadi.

Islamic State vehicles, tactical units, a fighting position and a building were hit in strikes near the Iraqi cities of Ar Rutbah, Falluja, Al Qaim and Baiji, Central Command said.

The report comes after it emerged that a dozen of the United States Air Force's most feared attack aircraft were to be deployed in the battle against ISIS.

Twelve A-10 'Warthogs' are being moved from Afghanistan to Kuwait to carry out patrols. They will be joined within weeks by around six Reaper drones armed with missiles, the New York Times reported.

The new weaponry marks an increase in the options open to military planners who have struggled to strike ISIS.

A-10s, originally designed to destroy Soviet tank squadrons if the USSR had invaded the West, have proved a deadly weapon against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.

Slow-moving and equipped with a devastating 30mm cannon capable of firing almost 4,000 rounds a minute - as well as missiles and 500lb bombs - they can fly as low as 50ft and engage targets far more slowly than the bombers and fighter-bombers which have so far been deployed in Iraq and Syria.

The decision to deploy A-10s and Reapers comes after a major battle-planning conference involving more than 200 commanders from 33 countries involved in the fight against ISIS.

America remains by far the largest single country involved, but has now received backing from more Muslim countries. 

The main concern over the campaign has been the lack of targets to strike because of the nature of ISIS, which combines large groups acting like a conventional army, with insurgency tactics.

Figures published in the New York Times show that just one in four missions over the last three months actually involves dropping bombs or firing missiles.

Three-quarters of planes return to base without having deployed their armament.
