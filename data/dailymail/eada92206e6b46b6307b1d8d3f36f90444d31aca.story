A woman who admitting building makeshift pipe bombs said she did it because it was her 'passion'.

Celia Savage, 24, who said she built explosive devices at her home as a 'hobby', pleaded guilty to making and possessing two pipe bombs yesterday.

When federal agents asked Savage what there was to do where she lived in north Georgia, she replied: 'Blow things up', court documents showed.

Savage entered the plea after reaching an agreement with prosecutors, and will be sentenced at a later date.

A police raid on Savage's home in May last year discovered
 a number of guns along with the two pipe bombs, as well as illegal drug 
paraphernalia, numerous pills, and substances believed to be 
methamphetamine and marijuana, court documents said.

Savage said she had used marijuana the day before the raid, and methamphetamine around two months before, according to a statement from a federal agent.

The statement said she told police she had made between five and seven pipe bombs of different sizes, and a 'cherry bomb' - a tennis ball filled with gun powder.

Savage said she knew it was wrong or against the law to make the devices, but that it was her hobby and that she was passionate about it, a report on ajc.com said.

During the hearing yesterday, Savage attempted to tell the judge she had no malicious intent towards anybody.

District Judge Richard Story said she would have the opportunity to speak at her sentencing hearing.

Savage declined to comment after the hearing.

Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a statement: 'Making bombs out of 
heavy metal pipe, explosive powder, and fuses is a serious crime, not a 
hobby, that carries significant penalties.'

Savage is understood to have been out on bond for around a year.

The conditions of her release demanded that she reside with her grandparents and be confined to their home at all times with the exception of work, medical appointments or court appearances.

A judge last week amended the condition, imposing a curfew from 1am to 8am.

Prosecutor William McKinnon told the judge the charges against Savage carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine.

The prosecutor said after the hearing that the plea agreement indicates Savage should serve between 57 and 71 months in jail. The judge is not bound by the agreement.
