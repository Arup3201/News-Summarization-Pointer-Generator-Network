Not content with being one of the leading makers of activity trackers, leaked materials suggest Fitbit is now taking aim at the smartwatch market.  

According to The Verge, the California firm is working on a wearable device dubbed Surge, which is set to be released by the end of the year and will cost $250 (£155).

In addition to tracking calories, steps, and elevation - similar to existing Fitbit models – the Surge will have a built-in GPS tracker, heart rate monitor and show smart notifications on the wearer's wrist.

The FitbitSurge is expected to go on sale by the end of the year and cost $250 (£155). It includes GPS, heart rate monitors and a sleep tracker. The wearable will additionally track steps, calories, distance and elevation – like current models (pictured) - but leaked materials state it is designed for more serious athletes.

This means it will directly compete with the high-end sports watches, as well as low-end basic trackers, and as a result has been labelled by The Verge as a 'superwatch.'

The details were revealed in marketing materials leaked to website's Chris Welch by a ‘tipster’.

Release date: By the end of the year

Price: $250 (£155)

Colours: Black, grey and orange

Features: GPS tracking 

PurePulse heart rate monitor

Pedometer and altimeter 

Smart notifications and music controls

Sleep tracker and silent vibrating alarm

Wireless syncing to the Fitbit app   

Other features of the wristband include a more advanced sleep tracker, and a silent alarm that wakes wearers up using vibrations.

Current FitBit models track runners using the GPS on a connected phone. 

It was rumoured that the Californian firm would release a standalone heart rate monitor called PurePulse, but this technology is now expected to be built into an upcoming device.

This is expected to provide real-time workout data, and statistics - including heart rate, calories, steps, pace, elevation and distance - will sync wirelessly to a smartphone via an app.

And the leaked reports revealed the watch will be available in black, grey and orange.

FitBit is also said to be on the verge of launching two other, similar devices, called FitBit Charge and FitBit Charge HR.

These were revealed in a patent application, filed earlier this year, which detailed a wearable device called FitBit Charge that includes, among other features: ‘Pedometers; altimeters;  devices for displaying [and] measuring, time, date, steps taken, calories burned, distance travelled, floors climbed, active time, elevation, altitude, speed, pace, hours slept, quality of sleep, heart rate, routes, navigational information, and weather information.'

The application also continued that Fitbit's patented devices will link to phones to 'control volume and notify users of incoming calls or messages.'

This suggests the devices will feature ‘smart’ notifications, including call and text notifications, on the wrist, and will let wearers control music from their wrist – in a bid to take on smartwatches.
