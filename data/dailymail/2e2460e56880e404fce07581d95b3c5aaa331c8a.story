Almost 500 people will share in the largest food safety settlement in Australian history after allegedly being poisoned by soy milk brand Bonsoy.

The popular milk alternative is believed to have contained almost 50 times the recommended daily intake of iodine as a result of ingredient Kombu, a seaweed product which made the substance toxic.

Nearly 500 people came forward claiming they had become ill after consuming the soy milk, including several women who are believed to have suffered miscarriages as a result of the iodine levels.

The lead plaintiff in the case, Erin Downie, was a regular drinker of Bonsoy, and increased her intake after her doctor advised that it may help with l actation problems from giving birth to her daughter Mirayke in 2008

Bonsoy was removed from supermarket shelves in late 2009 after and was reconstituted before being released to the public again, after 10 people, including a newborn baby, suffered thyroid problems in NSW. 

Lawyers claim that this is believed to be the biggest food safety class action ever made in Australia, settling for $25 million to be shared among the plaintiffs. 

Jacob Vargese, class action principal for law firm Maurice Blackburn, told Daily Mail Australia that the dangerously high thyroid levels caused a range of severe problems including thyroid failure.

'There are nearly 500 people we're representing in this class action, and all of them have been badly affected in a variety of ways,' he said. 

'The symptoms were quite diverse, as excess of iodine effects the function of the thyroid and a persons metabolism,'

'People have claimed symptoms running from lethargy and anxiety to much more severe metabolic problems including hospitalisation and in some cases even surgery to remove the thyroid,' Mr Vargese said.

The 33-year-old, from Dandenong Ranges in Victoria, became severely ill and was rushed to hospital suffering heart palpitations and unconsciousness

'I’ve been through a lot due to drinking Bonsoy, and so have hundreds of others all over Australia,' Ms Downie said at a press conference on Monday afternoon

The lead plaintiff in the case, Erin Downie, was a regular drinker of Bonsoy, and increased her intake after her doctor advised that it may help with lactation problems from giving birth to her daughter Mirayke in 2008.

The 33-year-old, from Dandenong Ranges in Victoria, became severely ill and was rushed to hospital suffering heart palpitations and unconsciousness.

She said her hair began falling out, her gums bled, she had boils over her body, and lost muscle function. 

She spent the next two years bedridden and said it robbed her of time with her daughter in the first years of her life.

'I wasn't just a little bit sick, it actually ruined the last seven years of my life,' she told reporters.

'I lost the first years of being able to enjoy my only child’s life because of the illnesses I suffered. Instead of hundreds of precious family memories, my memories are of being severely sick,' Ms Downie said.

'I’ve been through a lot due to drinking Bonsoy, and so have hundreds of others all over Australia,' she said.

Ms Downie still suffers from chronic fatigue symptoms, is unable to carry another child, and claims she has a lower immune system as a result of her thyroid problems. 

She said she was relieved and grateful justice had prevailed, and companies had to be held to account for ingredients being put into consumable products.

'I knew someone was responsible for the damage and I made it my mission to hold someone accountable.'

'Today means a lot because we’ve been able to get a result that tells us we were right to stand up to the companies involved, despite it being a long, tough road,' she said. 

The Australian distributor, Spiral Foods, and Japanese companies Muso and Marusan-Ai Co, have been named as the three defendants in the case, but have not admitted liability.

Mr Vargese said that the $25 million settlement still has to be approved by the court, with the next hearing scheduled to take place on the 29th of January.

Once the settlement has been approved, a scheme will be developed to distribute the amount between the members of the class act and assess their claims.

'Some are claiming for pain and suffering, some are claiming for damages for lost time at work and lost income,' Mr Vargese said.

'The broader point is that this case demonstrates the power of a class act,' he said.

'No one person could have brought this claim, but by banding together it's become an economic proposition,' he said.
