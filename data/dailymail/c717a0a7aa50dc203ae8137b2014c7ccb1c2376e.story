An iconic British image known throughout the world has resumed production after being brought back from the brink by a Chinese automotive giant.

The production line of distinctive black cabs began rolling again six months after the London Taxi Company (LTC) was rescued from administration by Geely.

Once fully up and running the line will manufacture ten vehicles a day, five days a week. Geely said restarting the business had created 66 new jobs at LTC’s Coventry plant.

Geely chairman Li Shufu and Business Secretary Vince Cable watched the first vehicles rolling through the factory.

Cable said that the Chinese firm’s investment 'has secured the future of the iconic black cabs company'.

'Geely's priority will be to re-establish the manufacture, sale and servicing of new and current vehicles on broadly the same basis as existed before the business went into administration,' Mr Li  said.

'This will include the continued assembly of the TX4 at Manganese Bronze's existing Coventry plant in the West Midlands.'

The future of the Coventry-based company had previously been in doubt before the buy-out was agreed

Peter Johansen, vice president of Geely's black cab operation, said the firm intended to invest in the city with new premises.

He said: 'I've got three sites that I'm looking at at the 
moment in Coventry... so we can get started on building the new factory 
for the new company and the new vehicles.'

The business plans to sell almost 2,000 cabs in its first year, after winning export contracts to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Geely bought LTC for £11m in February.

More than 130,000 black cabs have been made at the site over the past 60 years.

It is welcome news for Coventry, once a hub of car manufacturing that now has barely any automotive industry left.

Doubts: One city analyst says he is perplexed by the deal and fears production could be moved abroad

Pete Coulson, from the union Unite, said: 'It's good for the economy, good for the city and even more so for those who were made redundant and now get the opportunity to re-engage within the skills they already know.'

London mayor Boris Johnson said he was 'delighted' with Friday's news and is keen to hear Geely's proposals for producing a 'low-emission taxi to serve London in the near future'.

However, one city analyst says he is perplexed by the deal and fears production could be moved abroad.

'I am not sure why Geely would get itself into such a deal ... the black cab is too British to win mass appeal anywhere, not even in China,' said John Zeng, Asia Pacific director for consultancy LMC Automotive.

'The best hope for Geely is to move the production line to China, cut costs and sell it back to London.'
