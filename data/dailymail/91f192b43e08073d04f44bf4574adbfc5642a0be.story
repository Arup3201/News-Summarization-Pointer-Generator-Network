Chris Christie has attacked President Obama for not doing more to stop Sony cancelling the release of The Interview after it was struck by hackers.

He said the President ought to have called Sony and pulled strings with movie distributors to ensure the running of the controversial film - despite threats of 9/11-style attacks at theaters showing it. 

The New Jersey governor, a Republican, also attacked the President's recently-announced deal with Cuba, saying that America gets too little out of it and railing against the communist regime there for harboring criminals.

Christie, speaking on local station NJTV, said Obama 'made a mistake by not being assertive' when the crisis hit.

The President said shortly after the movie was pulled that he wished Sony had called him first - but by then then all screenings had been cancelled.

Christie told host Steve Adubato: 'It seems to me that it's the obligation of the President of the United States to call them.

'Sony made a mistake by backing off, and I think, quite frankly the President made a mistake by not being assertive'.

He said Obama ought to have gathered executives from Sony, movie theater chains, and his spies, and asked them: 'O.K., what's the nature of the threat and what can we do to stop it. Is there a safe way to show this movie?'

'That's what a leader does', Christie said.

Sony pulled in film after weeks of embarrassing revelations about the company, prompted by caches of emails and other information dumped online by hacking cell Guardians of Peace.

The group - which the White House later said was a front for the North Korean government - demanded that the studio cancel the film, which ridicules Kim Jong Un, the country's Supreme Leader.

One scene the hackers deemed particularly offensive showed Kim being blown up by a missile in slow motion. Material leaked online also implied it featured him taking part in a gay orgy.

Christie also rounded on the President's decision to re-open diplomatic relations with Cuba.

He said the deal should not have been made while officials continue to grant asylum to a woman who killed a New Jersey state trooper in the 1970s - and was a poor deal for the United States to begin with.

He told the show that the move was 'unacceptable' while Joanne Chesimard, a former Black Panther member, continues to live free in the country.

He said: 'These thugs in Cuba have given her political asylum for 30 years.

'It's unacceptable to have a reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba, and unacceptable to even consider taking them off the terrorist watch list if they are harboring a convicted cop killer.

'She murdered, in cold blood, a New Jersey state trooper on the side of the road who was just doing his job.'

Christie, who sent an outraged letter to the White House on the same subject this weekend, added that Cuba will benefit far more from the new situation than the United States will.
