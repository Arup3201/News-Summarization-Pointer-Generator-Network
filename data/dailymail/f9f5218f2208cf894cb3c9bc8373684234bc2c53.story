The explosion of a nine kilogram gas bottle claimed a man's life and destroyed the lives of all other occupants as an entire unit block burnt to the ground in northern NSW. 

Firefighters could not save the five-unit building on Owen St in Ballina which went up in flames at about 7.30pm on Friday night - completely gutting three of the apartments.

The body of 47-year-old Michael Richard Karel was discovered by a fire crew near the back door of his ground-floor flat once the inferno was extinguished.

Mr Karel had recently purchased the unit and only moved up the coast from Sydney about a month ago, The Northern Star reported.

Resident Susannah Poole, who was watching TV in her unit on the second floor at the time of the explosion, lost everything in the fire within a matter of minutes of her lucky escape. 

'I don't even have any underwear. I have nothing; everything I owned was in that place,' Ms Poole told The Northern Star.

'Just to have your whole life wiped out in one night where you don't own a single thing ... I should be grateful that I'm alive; but I am in shock.' 

Next door neighbour Julie Panshon, who was sitting in her back garden at the time, compared the sound to that of a bomb. 

'The middle unit had just exploded - it took hold so quickly,' she said.

Ms Poole, who cut her feet on broken glass while running down the stairs to escape the blaze, survived with only the clothes on her back, but it was the possessions she couldn't replace that were the most distressing for her.

'My parents are both deceased, and I had items that they'd given me and that hurts more than anything,' she said.

She is eternally grateful for the support of her friends who are holding a fundraiser to help Ms Poole kickstart a new life.

Inspector Nicole Bruce said there were no suspicious circumstances linked to the cause of the blaze, which has left the building structurally unsound, but the cause of the gas bottle igniting was not yet known.

The remains of the building is expected to be demolished as asbestos is now exposed throughout the site.
