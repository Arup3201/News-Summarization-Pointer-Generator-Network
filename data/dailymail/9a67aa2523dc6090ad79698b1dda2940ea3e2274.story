Influx: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says police are preparing for extremists who could return if they start losing in Iraq and Syria

Hundreds of British extremists could return to the UK if jihadist groups start losing battles in Iraq and Syria, the country’s most senior police officer has warned.

Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said it cannot be predicted when potential terrorists might decide to return home, but police are preparing in case of an influx.

It is estimated that around 500 Britons have travelled to Syria to fight alongside extremists, half of whom are thought to be from London.

Sir Bernard said there are 'a significant number of people who run the risk of being radicalised, militarised and potentially desensitised to violence, who one day we assume will come home'.

He added: 'The biggest concern certainly I have is that none of us know which way those wars are going to go. We’ve seen some quite radical movements across whole countries. Look at Iraq, the shift in a few days. These world events were moving at pace.

'That was obviously Islamists who were progressing positively. If there were to be a reverse of that at pace, and they were to lose, there is a risk that hundreds of people would want to come home. That’s the biggest challenge.

'We can’t predict when it might happen. Should there be large numbers returning it puts great pressure on all of us to make sure that we are kept safe.

'While they are there they are not an immediate threat, but should they come back, and should they come back together, that’s a concern. We are trying our best to prepare for that. No one should underestimate the task. 

Yesterday a photograph emerged showing British rapper Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, holding a decapitated head of a Syrian soldier while standing in Raqqa's central square - the capital of ISIS' self-declared caliphate.

He uploaded the image to Twitter alongside the post: 'Chillin' with my homie or what's left of him.' 

It was also revealed earlier this week  that a former supervisor at Primark who travelled to Syria to join the extremists was killed.

Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, was one of 10 Britons from Portsmouth – all of Bangladeshi origin – who went to Syria to join the Islamic State.

Militants: Earlier this week it was revealed that Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, from Portsmouth died in fighting. He fought with Mashudur Choudhury, the first British man to be convicted of terrorist activity in Syria

Rahman flew to Turkey with five other friends, and then crossed the border by land into Syria.

In May, Mashudur Choudhury, 31, who accompanied Rahman, but returned to the UK, became the first person in the UK to be convicted of taking part in terrorist activity in Syria. 

Concerns about homegrown involvement in terrorism increased after three young Britons appeared in a propaganda video for the insurgent group.

Among them was aspiring jihadi Aseel Muthana, who told the BBC he was fighting in Syria and had no intention of returning to the UK.

His brother Nasser appeared with two other British men - 20-year-old Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, and Abdul Raqib Amin, who grew up in Aberdeen. 

In April, the Metropolitan Police issued a plea for people to come forward with information about their family members if they were concerned about them joining terrorist training camps in Syria.
