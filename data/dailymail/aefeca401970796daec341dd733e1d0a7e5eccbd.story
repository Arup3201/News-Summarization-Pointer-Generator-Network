Contradicts beliefs: A new study has revealed that daily weather variations have little impact on people's moods

It's long been the belief that rainy days have a dampening effect on people's moods.

But a new study has revealed that daily weather variations have little impact on people's happiness or sadness - meaning we're just as content with the odd downpour as we are with blue skies.

The research, which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun is shining, will come as a surprise to most weather-obsessed Brits.

The study was conducted by Franz Buscha, principal research fellow at the University of Westminster, who monitored weather records with people's happiness. 

Mr Buscha merged daily weather data from the UK Met Office with individual level wellbeing data culled from the British Household Panel Survey between 1991 and 2008 and found no evidence that the often assumed relationship between sunshine and happiness existed.

Speaking to the MailOnline today, he said: 'I found it quite surprising that nobody had done any work on this in the UK. 

'I always hear people talk about the weather and that they are happy that the day is sunny instead of cloudy. I myself am one of such people!

'I decided to take a look and my initial assumption was that there would be an effect and quite a strong one. Good weather equals better mood. 

'However, this didn't turn out to be true. There are some weak effects in a naive correlation framework  but when we go to a more complex multivariate framework (i.e. we control for certain factors such as age, sex, location, etc) all this disappears.

The research, which will be presented by the Royal Economics Society next week, searched for correlations between happiness and temperature, sunshine, rainfall and wind speed. 

The research, which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun's shining, will come as a surprise to most weather-obsessed Brits. Above, sunbathers enjoy Brighton Beach in 17.5C heat last week

He added: 'The end result is that - much to my surprise - the effect of the weather on people's well-being is non-existent.

'Perhaps this is not surprising - when somebody asks you a question such as a) how do you rate your current well-being on a scale of 1 to 10 should weather really​ influence your answer? 

Up to one in four Britons suffer from seasonal affective disorder, with seven per cent of the population having full-blown SAD.

SAD is also know as the 'winter blues' as victims feel their symptoms begin with the turn of the season into Autumn.

In diagnosed cases, the symptoms can be so severe that they can cost people their jobs and break up relationships.

The effects vary from mild - tiredness during the day and over-eating - to very serious, such as joint pains, stomach upsets, loss of libido and even aggressive behaviour.

SAD is triggered by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that rules our body's main functions, such as sleep, appetite, sex drive, temperature, mood and activity.

When the days are long, natural light passes through the eye to the retina until it reaches the hypothalamus and stimulates these natural functions.

But if there is insufficient light, they begin to slow down and gradually stop - similar to a car running out of fuel.

In recent years, however, there has been growing evidence that there are many ways to reduce the chances of developing SAD or even to prevent it.

'People's well-being is driven by life events such as income, employment, health, family, death of a loved one, winning in the lottery, etc. 

'It seems we are all smart enough not to be influenced by a bit of rain!' 

What Mr Buscha's paper did assert is that people's job satisfaction is negatively impacted on sunny days.

The paper makes a clear distinction between daily weather and seasons. Mr Buscha did find significant evidence of seasonal affective disorder (Sad) whereby individuals become markedly less happy during the winter because of a lack of light. 

SAD is also know as the 'winter blues' as victims feel their symptoms begin with the turn of the season into Autumn.

In diagnosed cases, the symptoms can be so severe that they can cost people their jobs and break up relationships.

He added: 'One other thing to keep in mind, the paper talks about and short run weather variations (i.e. 5 days of rain type stuff). There is quite strong evidence that we all feel a bit unhappier in the winter.' 

Mr Buscha's findings may be seen as unimportant but levels of well-being are becoming a focus for the Office for National Statistics.

The research fellow suggested that a future line of inquiry could be a study into extreme weather.

He added: 'The top five hottest years ever have all been in the last 10 to 15 years. 

'Quite extreme weather patterns are starting to appear. There is an interesting question about what the effect of this will be.'
