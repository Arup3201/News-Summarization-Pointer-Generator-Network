Simon Pearce was once on the brink of stardom. A former disco-dancing champion, the Welsh actor and singer was a star of West End musicals such as Cats and Starlight Express and had landed a modelling contract in New York.

Better: Simon Pearce says he hopes to hit the big time once more after recovering from his illness

He appeared on stage with Liza Minnelli and mixed with A-listers like Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davies Jnr.

But just as Simon was about to hit the big time and be offered a part in a new group that was being put together - pop band sensation Steps - it all ended.

The once-superfit star, used to jumping around on a stage for hours every night, could barely move. He felt lethargic, had no energy and could barely drag himself out of the house.

Worse still for someone in a profession which relies on looks as well as talent and personality, his hair began to fall out in huge clumps.

Well-meaning friends put it down to stress over the loss of his mother who had recently died, but Simon knew it was more than that. However  doctors were baffled.

In the meantime, Simon was desperate to restore his failing locks and went to a clinic for a hair transplant.

'I was so worried about my health and what was happening to my hair,' recalls Simon, now 47.

'But it left me with terrible scars. It affected my confidence and my career and my hair still kept coming out.'

The surgeon who carried out the operation was later struck off for carrying out liposuction surgery without proper qualifications, but Simon is philosophical.

'I didn't complain as I'm not that type of person, but I do believe in karma, and what goes around comes around,' he says. 'I just don't think the man knew what he was doing.'

Friend: Simon counted Liza Minelli among his A-list friends during his theatrical heyday

He had to turn down the chance to sign up to Steps and was unable to work any more due to his weakness.

He
 was further hit by tragedy, as his father passed away and then his brother, former 
British heavyweight boxing champion Dave Pearce, died at the age of just 
41.

It took five years for Simon to be finally diagnosed with ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome.

Now living in Newport, Wales, Simon is taking medication for his condition which has made a great difference to his health.

He has also had a second, successful hair transplant from His Hair clinic in Birmingham and is ready to hit the big time again. 

'I was doing so well when I fell ill, but now I'm determined to rekindle what I had,' says Simon.

'When it was all going downhill, I was as low as I could possibly be. I did feel like not going on, to be honest - people with chronic fatigue syndrome have committed suicide.

But I've had an inner strength and believe that good things do come out of the bad times.

'I wouldn't be the person I am today without the things that have happening to me, and now I just want to get on with my life.'

The seventh son of a seventh son, Simon believes the words of a fortune teller once visited by a family friend, who told her that someone close to her called SImon would be successful and famous, but not until later on in his life.

'Hopefully that is what is going to happen,' says Simon optimistically.

Currently single, Simon spends his time concentrating on his song-writing and contacting his old friends in the industry to let them know that he is ready for his comeback.

'It's a big step for me, but now I just want to get on with my life.' he says.
