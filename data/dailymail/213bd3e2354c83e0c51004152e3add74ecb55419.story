The man from the pools would come to the front door for your coupon every Thursday and then James Alexander Gordon would enter your home on the airwaves at tea time on Saturday.

For 40 years, the wonderful, mesmeric Gordon would deliver what was potentially jackpot news to millions listening with pens poised, with that distinctive use of inflection that meant you knew the result before he had finished.

On the BBC’s Sports Report, firstly on Radio Two and latterly on 5 Live, the way he delivered the score for the home team always offered a hint of what was to follow.

Institution: James Alexander Gordon, who read the football results for 40 years, has died aged 78

BBC radio football pundit and former England international Jimmy Armfield: ‘He really was something special. People used to mark the pools coupons with the football results. James knew that. He always gave them time to find out whether it was 1, 2 or an X for the football pools.

‘There was no satellite broadcasting, everything came down the line on the radio. He was the first point of contact for who had won.

‘James knew it all, he was the consummate professional, he seemed to pitch it just right.’

BBC match analyst Mark Lawrenson: ‘When James started out there weren’t 10 reporters at every game. You had to wait for him for the definitive result.’

BBC 5 live senior football reporter Ian Dennis: ‘For a generation of football lovers James’s voice was Saturday afternoon for the complete picture.’

He was the voice of football before Sky had 24 cameras at every game; before Twitter and talkSPORT, Jeff Stelling and the digital revolution that has given every fan a platform.

Upon his retirement in 2013 because of the cancer that finally claimed his life on Monday, fellow broadcaster Mark Pougatch perhaps best summed up a very British footballing institution.

‘Even people who don’t even really like football knew who James was, even if they didn’t realise it,’ said Pougatch. ‘Such was James’s unique style of reading the classifieds, his wonderful inflections and stresses, that even non-believers of the sport knew the result after the home team’s score.

‘Nobody else will be able to say “Wolverhampton Wanderers” with quite such mellifluous tones. But enough of this ‘‘James’’. To those of us lucky enough to work at BBC radio sport, he is ‘‘JAG’’. And JAG is an institution, a legend and a gentleman all rolled into one.’

Gordon’s unique broadcasting style was actually inspired by his father.

‘Dad used to get really irritated by football announcers when he was filling in his pools coupon, because the intonation in their voices misled him,’ he once revealed in an interview.

‘So I decided to gather all the results on a Saturday before he’d checked his coupon and I would go into a cupboard with a torch and some kid-on radio equipment and read them out in a way I thought was more realistic.

Unique: Gordon's inflection meant listeners knew the result after he had announced the home team's score

‘When I did my first broadcast, dad cried and said: “The wee bugger’s finally done it”.’

The ‘wee bugger’ kept doing it for 40 years. He had what could only be described as a difficult childhood, even if Gordon would later insist it was a happy one.

Born in Edinburgh in 1936, his mother died in childbirth and his adoptive parents had to contend with him contracting polio that left him paralysed and in and out of hospital until the age of 15. He limped for the remainder of his life.

Amazingly, he also developed a speech impediment as a child but his father’s purchase of a radio led to Gordon’s fascination with speech. He would read Dickens and listen to the BBC’s Home Service, eventually becoming such a masterful orator that students in Sweden would be made to listen to him to perfect their English.

He did not actually follow a specific football team. Opportunities to attend matches were rare, his father only taking him when he could convince a worried mother that he was well enough to go.

Long-serving: Gordon joined the BBC in 1972 and continued until 2013 when Charlotte Green took over

Instead, he focused more on his passion for music and began his working life with record label Polydor. A career in broadcasting would follow. At one stage he worked as an announcer on Eric Morecambe’s radio show and in later years, Morecambe — one of his biggest fans — would often tease him with that famous tongue-twister scoreline: ‘East Fife 4, Forfar 5’.

Gordon joined the BBC in 1972, taking over the reading of the results two years later. He was only on air for five minutes each week but what a special five minutes they were, particularly in those days before there were other means of discovering the football results.

‘In those days (before he read the results) it was funereal,’ Gordon once said. ‘So I thought I would make it more musical. I wanted to reflect the mood of results.

‘For instance, if Arsenal have lost I’m sorry for them, and if Manchester United won I’m happy for them.’

He never once missed a day because of sickness, even after retiring from the BBC 10 years ago and working every Saturday as a freelancer. He was eventually replaced by Charlotte Green in September 2013.

James Alexander Gordon died at the Duchess of Kent Hospice in Reading aged 78. He is survived by his wife Julia, son David and two granddaughters.
