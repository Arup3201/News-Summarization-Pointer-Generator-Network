After a young woman was brutally gang raped and murdered in December 2012, the endemic violence against women and girls in India became front page news across the world.

But as Ross Kemp reveals in his latest documentary, India's rape epidemic is just the tip of the iceberg.

The country is also home to a trafficking trade that involves an astonishing 100 million people - 10 per cent of the population - and sees girls as young as nine being sold into the sex trade.

Man on a mission: Ross Kemp delves into India's seedy underbelly in search of traffickers

Among them is 12-year-old Mimoni, who was taken from her West Bengal home by traffickers when she was just 10 years old.

Now back with her parents after escaping, Mimoni is one of the few to be reunited with her family - most, sadly, are ostracised, even if they were forced into prostitution against their will.

'He told me he could get me work,' she explains of the day she met the man who would make her life a misery for the next two years.

'I was at school. He promised me food 
and a nice job paying two to three thousand rupees (Â£23) a month.'

She agreed to go with him but her dream of a bright future soon turned into a nightmare.

'He would get 
drunk, fondle me and rape me everywhere,' she says, facing Kemp and the camera with almost heroic frankness.

'It was anally, vaginally and 
orally. It was twice a day for two years. If I complained I was beaten. 
In the end I escaped.'

She adds: 'They [traffickers] are bad people who make lots of girls suffer.'

Like Mimoni, the destination for most of the girls is one of India's megalopolises, with Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai among the most popular.

Mumbai, India's most populous city, is also home to its largest concentration of sex workers, housed in a red light district that is the largest in Asia.

Exploitation: Shockingly, prostitutes make as little as 23p a time from the men who use them

Here, women, many of them trafficked, are forced to work around the clock, controlled by violent pimps and policed by vicious criminal gangs.

And it's not just bandits involved in the trade - local journalists report that the police, local politicians and government officials all get a slice of the lucre.

One of the women who work in Mumbai's vice trade is Rajashri, a 27-year-old who was trafficked from village near Bangalore as a 12-year-old.

'I
 was still at school when I was brought here,' she remembers. 'I was promised a job as a 
bottle washer. I said OK but they sold me into this dirty trade.

'They 
locked me in a room and the customers started coming up and I was a sex 
worker.'

Speaking of the first 'client' she ever encountered, she says: 'They told him I was a 
virgin and he had paid lots of money for that.'

Unlike Mimoni, she cannot go home to her family. 'At home, having sex 
outside of marriage is taboo,' she explains. 'They would have killed me and thrown my 
body in the river.'

Victims: Most trafficked girls come from West Bengal, which is poor and has a reputation for beautiful women

But things are scarcely any easier for the families denuded of their daughters, many of whom live in the desperately poor West Bengal region.

Among those to have lost their children to traffickers is Johana Sadar, whose 12-year-old daughter has been missing for a 
year.

'I was working in the field, I don't know how they got her,' she says of the day her child was taken.

'She 
was at home when I left at six in the morning. When I got home at 2pm, she
 was gone. She was nowhere to be found.'

Now, Mrs Sadar fears that her daughter is in the hands of a pimp. 'I'm
 afraid she's been sold and I don't know what they are making her do,' she says as tears roll down her lined cheeks.

'I think she's been sold. What else? What else apart from the sex
 trade could it be?

'I hope she comes back. I am desperate for her to come back. 
Only God knows what is happening to her.'

With 20,000 girls trafficked from West Bengal every year alone, according to Indian government statistics, the chances of Mrs Sadar's daughter living a safe and happy life elsewhere would appear to be slim.
