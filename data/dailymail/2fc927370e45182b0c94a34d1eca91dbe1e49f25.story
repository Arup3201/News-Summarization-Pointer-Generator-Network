Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny says the Gunners' Champions League surrender against Anderlecht was down to 'stupidity'.

Arsenal threw away a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Anderlecht on Tuesday night with Aleksandar Mitrovic scoring a last-minute equaliser.

And Szczesny, speaking to Polish website laczynaspilka.pl, blamed 'stupidity and lack of experience'.

The Gunners came from behind to beat Anderlecht 2-1 away last month and Szczesny compared Tuesday night to that game.

He said: 'Then we were lucky, but what happened today, I would not call bad luck. Rather, our own stupidity.

'You can have bad luck when you lose a one-goal lead. You can have very bad luck losing two-goal lead, but to lose three goals?

'It’s stupidity and lack of experience.'

Arsenal travel to Swansea on Sunday for a 4pm kick-off.

Szczesny will be hoping to put things right when Arsenal head to the Liberty Stadium on Sunday
