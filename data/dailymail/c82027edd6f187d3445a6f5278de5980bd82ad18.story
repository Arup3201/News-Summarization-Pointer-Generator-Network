There were protests in and outside the Missouri home of the St. Louis Rams on Sunday as tensions remain high almost a week after a grand jury declined to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed Michael Brown in August.

Five St. Louis Rams players stood with their arms raised in a show of solidarity for Ferguson protesters before trotting onto the field for pregame introductions at the Edward Jones Dome.

A Rams spokesman said on Sunday that the team was not aware the gesture had been planned before the game against the Oakland Raiders.

After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, the gesture made another appearance when he and Britt raised their hands together.

Across the street from the stadium, about 75 protesters gathered in the second half as about 30 police wearing riot gear watched from a safe distance.

Protesters chanted ‘Hands up, don't shoot!’ ‘No Justice, No Football!’ ‘This is what Democracy looks like,’ and ‘We're here for Mike Brown.’

The Rams had additional security measures in place for the game, including armed personnel from the National Guard. The team has wanded fans outside entrances all season. 

Earlier in the week there had been reports that the game might be moved because of the protests. 

In the end, the game remained in St. Louis giving the Rams the opportunity to show a sign of solidarity to the hometown crowd.
