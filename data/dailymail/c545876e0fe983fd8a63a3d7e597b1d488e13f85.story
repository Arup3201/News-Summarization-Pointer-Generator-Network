He looks like your average adventurous toddler with his huge grin and playful antics, but on the inside Braxton Rayner is battling a rare and inoperable brain tumour.   

In his short life, the two-year-old from Dalby in Queensland has already undergone two brain surgeries, fallen ill to meningitis, suffered multiple seizures and had eight MRIs.

Now, his parents Kirsten Kay and Clinton Rayner have been hit with the heartbreaking news the tumour has started to grow.

Two-year-old Braxton Rayner from Dalby in Queensland is undergoing surgery for third time this week in a bid to get a biopsy for his inoperable brain tumour

Braxton's parents Kirsten Kay and Clinton Rayner were recently told their only son's tumour had started to grow after he was first diagnosed 11 months ago

Braxton was first diagnosed with the inoperable tumour 11 months ago. 

There's no way for doctors to know exactly what type of tumour he has and whether it is malignant unless they carry out a biopsy.

'He's had surgery twice to try and get a biopsy. They go in through the top of his head but they can't see the tumour so that can't do it. They can only do it if they go behind his head,' Ms Kay told Daily Mail Australia.

'If they go through there, there's a very high risk he'll lose his sight and any movement because it is growing at the top of his spinal cord.

'My son is on the go, he's always outside. He loves playing around. We can't take that away from him – it's a very hard and difficult decision for us.'

Braxton is having his third surgery to try and get a biopsy this week.

'They've always said they won't do chemotherapy until they detect growth. Unfortunately they need to treat it and they've told us it needs to be treated straight away,' Ms Kay said.

'To treat him with the right chemotherapy, they need to do a biopsy to work out what kind of tumour they're dealing with and that just can't be an option.'

Braxton, pictured here with his dad Clinton getting antibiotics in June  after catching two brain infections, has been back and forth between Brisbane Children's Hospital and his home in rural Queensland for the past 11 months

Braxton's mum Kirsten said he had been through more than most adults over the past year and had shown remarkable courage

Despite the trauma of the past 11 months, Ms Kay said Braxton had shown remarkable courage.

'He's been through a lot more than many adults would have and he's been so brave,' she said. 

'Braxton is my hero, he's so strong. 

'As soon as he wakes up from surgery and the morphine wears off, he's running around and smiling. You would know there's something that big in his head.'

The young family have been back and forth between their home in Dalby, in central Queensland, and Brisbane since October. 

'Even though he's young, he's not stupid. When we're in the elevators at the hospital and we stop on level two he reacts and doesn't want to get out. He knows that's the level surgery is done on,' Ms Kay said. 

'When he does his MRIs he will just cry lying on his back. He knows what's going to happen. It's cruel but he takes it. I just have to tell him it's okay and I love him.

'He's our first child so the whole time I try not to think of the negatives.'

His parents first realised something was wrong when he started walking in to walls and falling over in October 2013. Three weeks later, Braxton stopped walking altogether

Kirsten and Clinton had built a brand new home in Dalby just before Braxton was born. Kirsten said if they had to sell the house they would to pay for the ongoing medical costs

Braxton's parents first realised something was wrong when he started walking in to walls and falling over - three weeks later he stopped walking altogether. 

'The first doctor we went to said it was an ear infection because that can make you wobbly,' Ms Kay said. 

'After he stopped walking we went to the best GP in town and he said we needed to get an MRI immediately. We went straight to Brisbane where they told us he had a tumour.

'We were transfered Brisbane Children's Hospital and they did surgery the next day - it all started back then and hasn't stopped.'

The constant time away from home is starting to take its toll financially on the family. 

'We built a brand new home just before Braxton was born. It's our home but if we have to sell it we will,' Ms Kay said.  

'It would just be a lot easier if we knew what it was, but we don’t. I hope there’s someone or something out there that can cure Braxton.'

The Braxton Fight Foundation has been set up to raise money for the two-year-old's treatment.

Doctors won't start chemotherapy until they know what type of tumour it is, which isn't possible without a biopsy
