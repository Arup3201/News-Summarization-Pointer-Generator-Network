The Obama White House sent three officials to attend Monday's funeral of slain teenager Michael Brown in Missouri, but sent no one to represent the president when photojournalist James Foley, decapitated by a terrorist on video, was memorialized Sunday in a New Hampshire church.

Foley was held captive by militants linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) before they killed him and released footage a week ago.

Marlon Marshall, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, is the highest-level official who made the trip to attend Monday's  funeral in St. Louis.

He's a native of the Missouri city and attended high school with Brown's mother.

Worthy: Obama's White House sent three emissaries to St. Louis for Brown's funeral on Monday

Didn't make the cut: Foley's memorial mass on Sunday drew no one from the Obama administration

Obama delivered a heartfelt speech last week after Foley's death was broadcast on the Internet, and then played golf

Joining him was Heather Foster, an adviser in Marshall's office, and Broderick Johnson, who chairs President Barack Obama's 'My Brother's Keeper' task force.

Attorney General Eric Holder also made a high-profile visit last week to Ferguson, Missouri, the town where white policeman Darren Wilson shot and killed Brown, a black 18-year-old, on August 9.rimal 

He came to mug for cameras and briefly oversee the beginning of a criminal investigation into whether Wilson violated Brown's civil rights.

A criminal investigation has been launched inside the FBI into Foley's execution at the hands of ISIS terrorists. 

But no one from the Obama administration visited Rochester, New Hampshire on Sunday for the memorial mass at Our Lady of the Holy Rosary church.

Foley's remains haven't been found, leaving his family to mourn him without the funeral and interment that Roman Catholics believe is an integral part of the end of life. 

'There was nobody that represented the White House,' church office assistant Connie Hammond told CNS News.

New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan and Rep. Ann Kuster came to the mass, along with both of the state's U.S. senators, Kelly Ayotte and Jeanne Shaheen – three Democrats among them – according to the Catholic Diocese of Manchester.

Pope Francis sent a message of condolence to the Foley family in a letter read aloud during the service.

'It's pretty embarrassing,' a former White House official told MailOnline, on condition of anonymity.

'In the last two years the White House has become more and more myopic. When you don't have to face voters anymore, some politicians let it all hang out. I'm afraid this one is especially prone to that.'

'My man! You are the man!' Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general, greeted Missouri's top highway patrolman who was in charge of keeping peace on the streets of Ferguson, Mo. last week

President Obama delivered a stirring tribute last week to Foley, calling him 'a journalist, a son, a brother, and a friend.'

'He reported from difficult and dangerous places, bearing witness to the lives of people a world away.'

The president began a round of golf less than 10 minutes later. 

Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council in the White House, told CNS that Obama's statement, delivered from his Martha's Vineyard vacation, was sufficient.

'The president expressed his profound condolences to the family in his statement last week,' Price said.

'He was speaking on behalf of his Administration – as well as the American people – in offering these words to the Foley family, and he continues to keep them in his thoughts as we attempt to bring the other American hostages home.'
