Sitting in its make-shift nest nibbling away at his lunch, this hungry vole seems to be recreating a scene from the classic tale: The Wind in the Willows.

But rather than a lavish banquet laid on by Mr Toad, this chap is happy with a more modest treat.

The water vole chewed on a large piece of pond weed while surveying his surroundings, a freshwater pond in Kent.

Time for lunch! The hungry fellow nibbles on a piece of greenery while happily perching in his home

Tasty treat: The vole chomps down on his food while watching the world go by

After lunch, the peckish animal spotted a small island only a little way away that was in reaching distance of his pudding - some delicious berries.

It quickly swam over and stood on its back legs to reach the blackberries before munching on them in the water.

The vole greedily pulled down two berries at a time, leaving one by its side as it gnawed on the other.

Quite a stretch: The vole reaches up to a collection of berries from a small island in the middle of the pond in Kent

Or maybe this one! The greedy vole seems to be having trouble choosing from the collection

After enjoying its second lunch, the water vole headed back home - perhaps for a well-deserved siesta.

Mark
Bridger, 44, travelled just two miles from his home in West Malling, 
Kent, to the ponds in East Malling to capture the amazing moment.

He said: 'I travelled to my local ponds to take photographs of the vole in the water.

'I got there at 7am and was prepared to stay there all day until I captured the perfect moment.

'I was very lucky that the branch of berries was hanging over the little island so the vole could get to the fruit.

'Voles love blackberries, itâ€™s their caviar, but I had to be very quiet and not move otherwise it would have scurried away.

Yum! Looking straight into the camera, the animal looks content with his find

Down the hatch! The vole grasps his last mouthful in his tiny claws

'I was keen to get a shot of the vole in the water pipe and get a picture of it living in its home,' said Mr Bridger.

'I was looking at the pipe for four hours and finally it appeared. I spent 12 hours in the pond and eventually left at 7pm.

'It
takes a lot of patience, sometimes it can be boring, but when I saw the
pictures at home, I was delighted and it makes it all worth it.'
