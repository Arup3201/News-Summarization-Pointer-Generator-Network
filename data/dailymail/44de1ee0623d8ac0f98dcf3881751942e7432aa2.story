Prince Charles yesterday called for the quality of food in hospitals to be made a ‘clinical priority’.

He wants the NHS to see ‘food as a medicine in itself’ and claims better meals would speed up recovery times.

He also made clear that he felt the changes were long overdue and could have benefits in other areas of healthcare including malnutrition among the elderly.

Last year The Campaign for Better Hospital Food accused NHS trusts of misrepresenting patient satisfaction with meals.

It
 found that while many trusts regularly claim 98 per cent approval 
rates, patient surveys reveal nearly half are dissatisfied with the 
food.

Many hospitals spend 
just £3 a day on meals for in-patients, compared with £5 a day set aside
 for prisoners.

Regulations control the quality of food served in 
government departments, schools and prisons, but there is no such system
 in the NHS.

‘Surely 
patients … have the same right to good food as government ministers, 
school children and prisoners?’ asked the campaign’s coordinator, Alex 
Jackson, who was at yesterday’s reception.

The
 event at Clarence House was organised by Prince Charles and the 
Department of Health, for NHS commissioners.

It highlighted the Hospital
 Food Exemplar CQUIN (Commissioning for Quality and Innovation), brought
 in last month, which allows commissioners to reward hospital trusts for
 delivering high quality food.

In
 a speech Charles said it was important to ‘see food as a medicine in 
itself’.

The prince said that what patients eat ‘will feed enormously 
into improving not only people’s health but also reducing the levels of 
malnutrition amongst the elderly’.

‘You
 can imagine just how delighted I was that last month NHS England 
launched an initiative CQUIN, which for the first time actually 
encouraged commissioners to make hospital food a clinical priority,’ he 
added.

The prince pointed to Mike Duckett, former catering manager at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, as an ‘inspiration’.

Mr
 Duckett persuaded hospital authorities to let him open its shut-down 
kitchens, hire an organic chef and link up with local farmers in Kent so
 that fresh seasonal produce could be supplied to the hospital.

He
 also set up a restaurant for staff and visitors that made money and 
slashed food waste – all on the existing budget.

This kind of set-up, 
Charles said, created a ‘virtuous circle’ of sustainability, helping the
 local economy and ensuring better patient health.

Mr
 Duckett said: ‘I go for quality over cost each time. For too many years
 now hospitals have been using the meals they serve … as a means of 
cutting costs, putting pressure on outside catering companies to deliver
 cheap and frankly sub-standard food … I actually found it cheaper in 
many respects to make the food from scratch rather than buy it in.’

Nottingham
 University Hospital Trust, which also transformed its menu, was awarded
 a Food For Life mark by the Soil Association, of which Charles is 
president.

Catering manager
 John Hughes said the cost of food per head is £4 a day, adding: ‘When 
you think that we are also sourcing all our food locally and in doing so
 benefiting the local economy … it’s a very good deal.’
