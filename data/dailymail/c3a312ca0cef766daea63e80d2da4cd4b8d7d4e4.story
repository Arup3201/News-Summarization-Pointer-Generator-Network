THE OPERATION

HYSTERECTOMY – the surgical removal of the uterus and cervix, and sometimes Fallopian tubes, ovaries and pelvic lymph nodes.

Usually carried out to treat or prevent cancer, or remove benign tumours, it may involve an incision in the abdomen, but can be carried out through  the vagina or via keyhole surgery. All options involve a general anaesthetic.

THE SURGEON SAYS

Mr Demetri Panayi, consultant gynaecologist at Epsom and  St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, says: ‘The fitter you are before surgery the quicker you’ll recover. You can get abdominal and back pain after surgery so taking nurofen before the op will help.

‘Get moving as soon as you can afterwards as this speeds recovery. Start with some gentle walking. Don’t go swimming until the wound  has completely healed to avoid infection, and don’t lift anything heavier than a full kettle until you are fully recovered to give abdominal muscles time to knit.

‘Consider the layout of your home. Will the bed be within easy access of the bathroom? Can you avoid stairs?

‘Some bleeding is normal but if it goes on for a few days or  is heavy or painful, see your doctor. Use sanitary towels rather than tampons to help reduce the risk of infection.

‘Opt for showers rather than baths, and avoid fragranced soaps as they can irritate. Keeping up fluid intake and having plenty of fruit and fibre in your diet will help with bowel or bladder movements.

‘Wear loose-fitting clothes and avoid tight underwear.  If your ovaries have been removed, it may bring on menopausal hot flushes. You may be offered HRT, so discuss this with your doctor.’

THE PATIENT SAYS

Sara Murawa, 52, a special-needs teacher from Cheshire, had the operation three years ago after suffering with fibroids and anaemia. She  says: ‘I knew I was going to be immobile so before I went  into hospital I made sure everything I’d need was  within easy reach. I also had  a bikini wax – psychologically, it made me feel better.

‘I took plenty of pairs of big knickers and large sanitary towels into hospital. There was some bleeding and the only thing they give you in hospital are incontinence pads, which are depressing to wear. I also took in a V-shaped body pillow to support my lower back.

‘I was catheterised, which I don’t remember anyone telling me about, and it was a shock to discover this. The catheter can be in for up to 24 hours.

‘You can get a lot of wind  pain after the operation since it can make you constipated, and so drinking some peppermint tea was invaluable.

‘I felt unstable on my feet when I first started moving around – having comfortable supportive shoes is vital.

‘Prepare friends and family for how emotional you might feel. My two sons were 16 and 19 at the time and we had no intention of having more children, yet there was still a sense of loss which made me very emotional. You need people around you to support you through that.’
