'I said it (the laptop) had a bit of porn or something like that,' he told jury

Rebekah Brooks' husband hid a stash of lesbian porn behind some bins to avoid police finding it and leaking details of his 'smut' to the press, the phone hacking trial heard today.

Charlie Brooks told the Old Bailey he wanted to avoid a 'Jacqui Smith moment' for his wife - a reference to the former Labour Home Secretary's embarrassment when her husband watched a sex film later claimed on her expenses.

The race horse trainer, his wife and former News International head of security Mark Hanna denies conspiracy to pervert the course of justice between July 5 and 19 2011 - by allegedly trying to hide evidence of hacking at the News of the World.

Mr Brooks told the jury he 'incredibly stupidly' decided to hide a bag containing explicit DVDs and a case with a laptop inside, but claims it was not cover to up a crime.

Admission: Charlie Brooks (pictured centre today with his wife Rebekah behind) told the hacking trial he hid lesbian porn and his laptop containing 'smut' to avoid police leaking details to the press

The trial heard previously the films included Instant Lesbian, Bride of Sin, and Lesbian Psychodrama volume 2 and 3.

Brooks said he had hidden the items behind the bins of an underground car park at the couple's flat in Chelsea, west London.

Asked by his counsel Neil Saunders why Brooks acted in this way, the witness said: 'The DVDs are of an embarrassing nature.

'On the Sony Vaio, the main reason was it (the laptop) had some important book ideas that weren't backed up anywhere else, but it also had a bit of smut on it.

'When I got back to the flat, I envisaged 20 policemen coming in and emptying every drawer and looking under every nook and cranny.

'I did think about my DVDs and I had my Jacqui Smith moment - a Home Secretary who was implicated by her husband's porn.

'I didn't want the same thing to happen to Rebekah.'

Protection: Mr Brooks said he wanted to avoid a 'Jacqui Smith moment' for his wife, right. This is a reference to a former Home Secretary whose husband watched a porn film claimed on her expenses

Support: Ms Brooks arrived at the Old Bailey with her mother today, which heard about an alleged conspiracy to hide evidence of hacking

The incident happened while his wife was being interviewed by police in Lewisham. The court heard Rebekah Brooks had described her arrest that day as police making 'a PR point'.

Her husband went back to retrieve the bags later but they had gone, having been picked up by a caretaker and handed to police when the bins were emptied.

Brooks told the court his motive to hide the belongings was the result of an 'instinctive reaction' that police could 'leak this sort of material to the press'.

He told the court: 'Ever since Operation Weeting (the phone hacking investigation) had been at the buildings at News International, a lot of stuff had been leaked, particularly to the Guardian.

'A lot of stuff had been leaked and I was very aware of that.'

He said: 'Incredibly stupidly and rashly, I thought I would just put these to one side. They (police) wouldn't take it away and I wouldn't lose my material.'

Brooks told the court that his wife 'went ballistic' when he informed her he had hidden some of his belongings from police.

He said: 'I said it (the laptop) had a bit of porn or something like that.'

Brooks, wearing a dark suit and light blue shirt, spoke loudly and clearly from the witness box as he described the day of his wife's arrest.

The court heard of one text from Rebekah Brooks to her husband in which she asked him to contact News Corp chairman James Murdoch and inform him of her custody status, following her resignation from News International hours earlier.

The text from the tabloid editor to her husband on the morning of July 17 read: 'Police going to arrest me to make a PR (public relations) point before the Select Committee appearance.'

Evidence: CCTV images allegedly showing Charlie Brooks hiding evidence while wife Rebekah was being questioned by police were shown to the jury in the hacking trial in January

The pair then went from their home in Oxfordshire to London where the former tabloid boss met with lawyers and went to Lewisham police station.

Charlie Brooks said he spent the rest of the day at the couple's London flat waiting for news of his wife's arrest.

He told the court a friend, Chris Palmer, arrived and they drank wine before ordering two pizzas.

He said: 'At that point we wanted a bit of blotting paper. We had drunk six bottles of red wine that night.

'I was glued to Sky News. There was precious little information coming out of the police station.'

Brooks also described his security team - before being cut short by Judge Mr Justice Saunders - as 'incredibly bored and complete fantasists'.

The court heard that Rebekah 
Brooks returned to the flat that night, where she described her husband 
as 'several sheets to the wind'.

Her husband told the court: 'I think she was being quite charitable.

'I was pretty wobbly. It had been a stressful day and I had probably drunk more than was wise.'

The
 following morning, Brooks said he felt 'pretty rough' and thought about
 getting the bags back - which he said he believed were still in the 
garage.

Brooks
 said the garage was secure and he was 'pretty confident' that the cargo
 would be there somewhere. He said he then 'went downstairs to help the 
search party'.

But it had been handed to police.

Prosecutor Mr Edis said the Sony laptop was 'useless', having been only used to access four files in 2010, and then not once since.

One of those files was an image, named CharlieBrooks.jpg, which was a portrait of the defendant posing with his chin resting on his fist.

Brooks said, to ripples of laughter in 
the court: 'That is the photo the Telegraph used of me. That's not the 
greatest picture in the world, is it?'

Brooks, who said he was 'useless' with technology, said there had been an issue with the machine ever since it 'blew up' when he 'cleaned it with some water'.Mr Edis said the laptop was a 'really useless old machine'.

But Brooks said it was useful as it had some 'incredibly important information on it', relating to his novel ideas.

'Some of the best ideas lay dormant for years,' he said.

Brooks, 51, and his wife, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, and 50-year-old Hanna, of Buckingham,

Buckinghamshire, deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

All seven defendants deny all charges in the hacking investigation.

The trial will continue tomorrow.
