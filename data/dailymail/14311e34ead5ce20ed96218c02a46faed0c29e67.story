Under mounting pressure to speak out about the controversy that has engulfed the department store this week, the rap mogul released a lengthy statement on his website after an online petition called for him to bow out of his upcoming partnership with Barneys.

The Manhattan superstore stands accused of profiling two young black people, calling the police on both after they purchased expensive items.

The rapper has signed a contract to design an exclusive line for Barneys that will be available next month.

But Jay-Z - whose real name is Shawn Carter - defended himself, saying that he hasn't spoken about it because he's still trying to figure out exactly what happened.

'I move and speak based on facts and not emotion,' the statement said.

Speaking out: Jay-Z has faced claims of supporting Barneys in the wake of their racial profiling scandal. The rapper says he is waiting to receive all the proper information before commenting or taking action, and that he has been demonized for doing so

'I haven't made any comments because I am waiting on facts and the outcome of a meeting between community leaders and Barneys. 

'Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately?'

'I am not making a dime from this collection ... I need to make that fact crystal clear. The Shawn Carter Foundation is the beneficiary ... This money is going to help individuals facing socio-economic hardships to help further their education at institutions of higher learning.

'I am against discrimination of any kind, but if I make snap judgements, no matter who it’s towards, aren’t I committing the same sin as someone who profiles? 

'I am no stranger to being profiled and I truly empathize with anyone that has been put in that position.'

The statement came after residents of Marcy House, in Brooklyn, where Jay-Z grew up, called on the '99 Problems' rapper and husband of Beyonce to think about those who have not become as succesful as him.'Jay Z and my son grew up together,' said Effie Hardy, 74, to the New York Daily News.

'That could be his family Barneys is profiling. They would’ve done the same thing to him back in the day, before he got to where he is now. He should remember that.'

The luxury and exclusive collection that Jay-Z has lent his considerable clout to is named 'A New York Holiday,' and the cheapest item is a $70 cotton T-shirt, while a Shawn Carter watch by Hublot with alligator skin straps will cost $33,900.

Another Marcy resident, Annette Rush, 40, told the New York Daily News that as a role model, Jay-Z should think about the ramifications of the two shoppers allegations.

'My money is as good as anybody else’s money. It’s all green,' said Rush.

'From someone that came from the hood, he should know all that. He knows how hard it is. I don’t think he should sell his things there, not at a place where there’s racial profiling going on. It’s ridiculous.'

The controversy began when two black customers came forward to say that they had been stopped and detained after buying expensive items from the luxury store.

On Tuesday, Trayon Christian, 19, from Queens said that he was suing the city and Barneys after he was accosted by two undercover NYPD detectives after he had bought a $349 Ferragamo belt.

And then on Wednesday, Kayla Phillips, 21, a seven-month pregnant mother from Canarsie, Brooklyn, said that she too had been stopped.

The young mother, from Brooklyn, New York, said she experienced similarly shocking treatment from staff at the Madison Avenue store in February when she bought a $2,500 Céline handbag.

She has now filed a $5 million notice of claim with the city showing her intention to sue the NYPD.

'As I was walking into the train station, four undercover police officers attacked me,' Phillips told the New York Post.

'They were very rough,' she added to the New York Daily News. 'I didn't know what was happening.'

She explained to the cops that she had used a temporary Bank of America card to make the purchase - and they demanded to know why her name was not on it.

Complaint: Kayla Phillips, 21, says cops demanded to know how she could afford to buy a $2,500 Céline bag from Barneys in New York - in a case that echoes that of a teen accusing the store of racial profiling

Shock: She called her mother Wendy Straker (right with Kayla) who said she heard police ask her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?'

She called her mother, Wendy Straker, who said that the police officers had asked her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?'

Straker added that the police were on the phone with a Barneys employee about the transaction.

Police finally let her go after she showed them her ID and new debit card, which arrived that morning.

'Jay Z is getting ready to do a campaign with Barneys, but they’re looking at these African-American kids like they're thieves,' Straker said.

The case comes after it emerged that another shopper, Trayon Christian, was stopped and handcuffed after he bought a $350 Salvatore Ferragamo belt in the store.

Christian, 19, has now filed a lawsuit for unspecified damages against the Madison Avenue store and the NYPD who wrongly accused him of fraud.

Mr Christian, who lives with his mom in Queens, had decided to splash out on the belt after seeing one of his favorite music stars, Harlem rapper Juelz Santana, wearing the accessory.

However once he had paid for the belt and had left Barneys on April 29 this year, the fashion-loving teen was grabbed by undercover officers on the street.

According to the civil rights lawsuit, the 19-year-old was asked 'how a young black man such as himself could afford to purchase such an expensive belt'.

Mr Christian's lawyer Michael Palillo told the New York Daily News: 'He's never been arrested. His only crime was being a young black guy buying a $300 belt.'

Trayon Christian, 19, has brought a lawsuit against Barneys and the NYPD after they wrongly accused him of fraud when he purchased a designer belt

Barneys department store is facing a lawsuit after a 19-year-old black student claims he was wrongly grabbed by store detectives because of his color and accused of stealing a designer belt

A Barneys store employee had asked the 19-year-old for ID when he used his Chase debit card to buy the belt. Mr Christian showed the clerk his state ID.

The store cashier then subsequently called the police to claim that the purchase was a fraud, according to the lawsuit.

Officers took the teenager to a local precinct.

Mr Christian once again showed his ID, debit card and receipt for the belt. Officers still refused to believe the teenager.

Finally Chase bank was contacted who verified that the debit card belonged to Mr Christian. It was only then that he was allowed to go after spending two hours in a holding cell, the suit claims.

The NYPD denied this and said the student was only held for 42 minutes.

The student, who has no history of arrests, said that he will never shop at Barneys again following the incident.

A Barney's New York spokesman said: 'Barneys New York typically does not comment on pending litigation.

'In this instance, we feel compelled to note that after carefully reviewing the incident of last April, it is clear that no employee of Barneys New York was involved in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale.

'Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights.'
