Liverpool have added Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez to their list of attacking targets.

The England international is not due to play again until October following surgery on a ruptured anterior cruciate but is admired by manager Brendan Rodgers as are Swansea's Wilfried Bony and QPR striker Loic Remy.

Liverpool have £75million to spend following the sale of Luis Suarez. They have already bought Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and want defender Dejan Lovren who returned on Sunday despite threatening to strike.

Liverpool will open talks with Sevilla this week over a possible loan for striker Iago Aspas and could revive their bid for left-back Alberto Moreno as part of negotiations.
