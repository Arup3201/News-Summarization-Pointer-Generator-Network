Administrators have confirmed this morning that 66 HMV stores employing almost 1,000 members of staff will close over the next two months.

Deloitte said the shops would continue to trade but the first closures were expected in a month's time.

The 66 stores earmarked for closure employ 930 staff and make up more than a quarter of the chain's high street shops.

Cuts: Administrators Deloitte said today that they hoped the brand had a future as a 'restructured business'

The 66 stores identified for closure by HMV's administrators are:

Ashton-under-Lyne, Ballymena, Barnsley, Bayswater, Belfast Boucher Road, Belfast Forestside, Bexleyheath, Birkenhead, Birmingham Fort, Blackburn, Boston, Bournemouth Castlepoint, Bracknell, Burton-upon-Trent, Camberley, Chesterfield, Coleraine, Craigavon, Croydon Centrale, Derry, Dumfries, Durham, Edinburgh Fort, Edinburgh Gyle Centre, Edinburgh Ocean, Edinburgh Princes Street, Edinburgh St James, Falkirk, Fulham, Glasgow – Fort, Glasgow – Silverburn, Glasgow Braehead, Huddersfield, Kirkcaldy, Leamington Spa, Leeds White Rose, Lisburn, Loughborough, Luton, Manchester 90, Moorgate, Newry, Newtonabbey, Orpington, Rochdale, Scunthorpe, South Shields, Speke Park, St Albans, St Helens, Stockton-on-Tees, Tamworth, Teesside, Telford, Trocadero, Wakefield, Walsall, Walton-on-Thames, Wandsworth, Warrington, Watford, Wellingborough, Wigan, Wood Green, Workington, Wrexham

Scotland has been particularly hard hit with all five of Edinburgh's stores closing. Three stores will also close in Glasgow.

Administrator Nick Edwards said the 
shops had been identified as part of an ongoing review of the company's 
financial position and the group still hoped to secure a future for the 
restructured business.

He said: 'This step has been taken in order to enhance the prospects of securing the business' future as a going concern.

'We continue to receive strong support from staff and are extremely 
grateful to them for their commitment during an understandably difficult
period.'

'Execution': Tweets from HMV's official account slammed the firing of 60 employees in one meeting recently

The group, which currently has 220 UK stores, called in the 
administrators last month, but hopes of a rescue deal have been raised 
after restructuring firm Hilco - the group behind HMV Canada - bought 
the company's debt.

Sheila Gilmore, Scottish Labour MP for Edinburgh East, tweeted her concerns about the closure of all the city's stores. 'News that all HMV stores in Edinburgh will close is devastating for workers,' she said. 'Thoughts are with them today.'

Its demise has been widely blamed on online shopping.

Recently,
the internet caused further problems for the struggling chain – when 
staff hijacked the firm’s Twitter account to post a blow-by-blow account
of mass sackings at head office.

Angry staff gave live updates of the ‘mass execution’ at the beleaguered music firm’s London headquarters.

Around 190 workers both there and across its distribution centres were fired.

The incident triggered panic among HMV
executives who were seen marching around the office pleading for advice
on how to delete the tweets and shut down the @hmvtweets feed.

The first read: ‘We’re tweeting live 
from inside HR where we’re all being fired! Exciting!!’ One minute later
came the update: ‘There are over 60 of us being fired at once! Mass 
execution of loyal employees who love the brand.’

Final stand: The rebellious tweets went on to say the firm was being 'ruined' so they had no other choice

HMV later deleted all its tweets then added these two tweets later, saying there have been job losses but 'not in our stores'

Just looking: Supportive Twitter users praised the courage of the rogue member of staff

Another followed: 
‘Just overheard our marketing director (he’s staying folks) ask “How do I
shut down twitter?”.’

One message, spread over two posts, 
read: ‘Under usual circumstances, we’d never dare do such a thing as 
this.

However, when the company you dearly love is being ruined and 
those hard working individuals, who wanted to make HMV great again, have
mostly been fired, there seemed no other choice.’

The company managed to delete the tweets by mid-afternoon, however not before they had been re-tweeted thousands of times.

Poppy Rose Cleere, who described 
herself as HMV’s social media planner, said she was behind 
the tweets.

The 21-year-old said senior managers ‘never seemed to grasp’
the importance of social media.

‘I hope they’re finally listening,’ 
she said in a message from her personal account.

‘Since my internship 
started, I worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance 
of social media – not as a short-term commercial tool, but as a tool to 
build and strengthen the customer relationship, and to gain invaluable 
real-time feedback from the consumers that have kept us going for over 
91 years.’

Staff at HMV, which employs more than 
4,000 people, have been afraid for their future since the chain went 
into administration last month.

There are hopes that many of the 239 
shops and their staff can be saved through a sale of the business to 
Hilco, which specialises in rescuing failed brands.

Hilco has already purchased HMV’s bank debts, while it is now negotiating to take over the stores.

Its efforts are understood to have the support of a group of music labels and film studios, including Universal Music and Sony.

The industry believes it is vital to 
keep a national chain of entertainment shops on the High Street to 
provide competition to web retailers, such as Amazon, and the big 
supermarkets.

Accountants Deloitte have been appointed as administrators
and are overseeing the negotiations and the staff dismissals.

It said there have been just over 100 
redundancies at head office locations in London, Marlow and Birmingham 
and around 85 across the distribution network.

Joint administrator Nick Edwards said 
of the redundancies: ‘Although such decisions are always difficult, it 
is a necessary step in restructuring the business to enhance the 
prospects of securing its future.’
