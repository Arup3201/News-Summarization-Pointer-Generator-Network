From fish and chips at the seaside, to exploring castles and forests, or just skimming stones, they are the simple things which give us the most pleasure.

All these and many more are contained in a guide produced by England’s national tourist board which aims to provide inspiration for bank holiday outings.

Some 2,000 parents were asked to share and celebrate their favourite traditional activities, attractions and days out with VisitEngland.

Sunset: Picnicking on the shores of Windermere in the Lake District, Cumbria made the list of pleasures

Dining out: People said they really enjoy a fish supper on Blackpool Pier, Lancashire

Simple pleasures: Cornwall is one of the places Brits remember most from their childhood according to VisitEngland. Here, surfers crowd Polzeath  Beach

The result is a list of 25 excursions 
which hark back to a bygone age when the great outdoors was considered 
the ultimate place for a fantastic day out.

Enjoying
 a fish supper on Blackpool Pier tops the list, followed by afternoon 
tea in Devon and picnicking on the shores of Windermere in the Lake 
District.

Boating on the 
Norfolk Broads, fossil-hunting on the Isle of Wight, marvelling at 
Stonehenge and going blackberry picking also figure in the charming 
list.

Others like trying to make the Queen's Guard laugh at Buckingham Palace

Negotiating the maze 
at Hampton Court Palace was the only activity from London to make the 
top ten, although trying to make the Queen’s guards laugh at Buckingham 
Palace is at number 13.

The 
‘Simple Pleasures’ campaign was inspired by Winnie-the-Pooh and aims to 
encourage modern families to get outdoors. The guide features drawings 
in the style of EH Shepard, who illustrated the AA Milne books about the
 bear’s innocent adventures.

Sarah
 Bates, publishing director at Egmont, said: ‘Winnie-the-Pooh shares 
many a simple adventure with his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood so he 
is the perfect character to remind us how to enjoy the simple pleasures 
England has to offer.’

Pooh
 makes it into the list himself: number 17 is playing Pooh Sticks at the
 real Hundred Acre Wood –  Ashdown Forest in East Sussex.

Another
 activity sweet-toothed Pooh would doubtless approve of –visiting a 
honey farm – is at number 19. Rock-pooling in Cornwall, camping in the 
New Forest and riding a narrow boat through Birmingham’s canals also 
feature.

Overall, the 
South-West of England came out on top as the area that offers the best 
opportunity to enjoy life’s simple pleasures, closely followed by the 
South-East and the Midlands. Parents who took part in the study also 
highlighted just how precious quality family time is, with more than a 
third saying they enjoy at least one family outing a month.
