Romanian immigrant Simon Calin, 37, stole 54 bottles of Famous Grouse worth more than £1,000, magistrates were told

A Romanian who stole 54 bottles of 
whisky told a court it was his first mistake since he’d arrived in the 
UK – just nine days earlier.

Simon
 Calin had been lured to the UK with the promise of good job to support 
his wife and child, Furness Magistrates’ Court heard on Thursday.

The 37-year-old arrived in Britain on January 2 but by the 11th he found himself in Barrow, Cumbria, with no job or money.

He
 then loaded 54 bottles of Famous Grouse whisky, worth £1,080 in total, 
into a shopping trolley along with tissues and some bags before walking 
out of the Tesco store in Barrow without paying.

Peter
 Kelly, prosecuting, said: ‘‘He told police he was on his own and had 
been here one week, two days, his money had run out and this was the 
first mistake he had made.’

CCTV cameras caught Calin, of Leigh, Cumbria, getting into a car which drove off but was later stopped by police.

He
 pleaded guilty to theft and failing to surrender. He was given an 
eight-week curfew and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a £60 victim 
surcharge.

But in a final 
twist, the court was told he could not be sentenced to unpaid work as 
his English was not good enough to understand health and safety 
information.

Trystan Roberts, defending, said: 'What Mr Calin tells me is he arrived in the UK about one week before this incident.

The Romanian pushed a trolley loaded with bottles of whisky out of this Tesco store before police caught him

'He was coming, as people do, in order to find work and to provide for his wife and child in Romania.

'He had been told when he came over here there would be a job available for him and that work would be well paid, but the reality was very different.'

Mr Roberts told the court Calin had been cajoled into being the ‘fall guy’ by a group of others who said by stealing the whisky it would answer his money troubles.

The goods were all recovered in a re-saleable condition, and the court was told Calin now had the promise of a job in a car wash in Leigh, where he is living with his sister.

Calin was given an eight-week curfew from 7pm to 7am, and ordered to pay court costs of £85 and a £60 victim surcharge.

The court was told he could not undertake unpaid work as his English was not good enough to understand health and safety information.
