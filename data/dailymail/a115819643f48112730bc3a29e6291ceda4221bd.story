Jamaica's double Olympic sprint silver medallist Yohan Blake has been ruled out for the rest of the 2014 season after undergoing surgery on an injured hamstring.

The 24-year-old sustained the injury in the 100 metres at the Glasgow Grand Prix on July 11.

'Right now he's on crutches, he had to have an operation a couple of days ago,' coach Mills said on Tuesday.

'The injury was quite severe and the original prognosis was misdiagnosed.

'He went to Germany and when they had a good look, they realised that it was more serious and required surgery, so he'll be out for quite a long time.'

Blake, who could not defend his 100m world title in Moscow last year because of a hamstring injury, had opted against racing at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow starting on Wednesday to concentrate on his build-up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
