A mother who couldn’t cuddle her son because she was so overweight has dropped six dress sizes after undergoing gastric surgery.

Marie Briggs, 25, tipped the scales at 20st and was so large her young son, Hayden, was unable to wrap his arms around her for a hug.

Her size also affected the time she spent with Hayden as she felt unable to join him doing activities like swimming and going to the fun-fair.

As she was: Marie Briggs, 25, weighed 20 stone and was so big her son Hayden couldn't put his arms around her for a hug

She said: 'Hayden loves swimming but the idea of putting a swimming costume on was too daunting so we never went. I spent my days on the sofa, reading magazines and eating instead.

'I wanted to be the best mum I could be, but I couldn’t even take him to the fun-fair because I was scared I wouldn’t fit on the rides.'

Marie, from Amble in Northumberland, started to gain weight after splitting from Hayden’s father not long after giving birth to her son, now seven.

She started comfort eating, tucking into a large bowl of cereal and two slices of buttered toast every day for breakfast.

Slimmed down: Marie is now a dress size 14 after losing 7st following gastric surgery. She loves her new shape and how she can now fit into pretty dresses

Lunch was two Cornish pasties with crisps or a large MacDonald’s meal, all washed down with a large fizzy drink. While at dinnertime she would order a large chicken curry with chips, spring rolls and prawn crackers from her local Chinese takeaway.

Indulging her sweet tooth, Marie would often snack on crisps and chocolate between meals.

As the weight crept on, Marie’s self-confidence ebbed away. 'I used to burst into tears in changing rooms because everything looked terrible on me,' she said.

Heath risk: The mother knew she had to do something about her weight after she developed diabetes

And it wasn't just finding clothes to fit her dress size 26 that was a problem. At nearly 20st, her health deteriorated and she was diagnosed with diabetes.

'I started to worry that I would lose limbs because of my diabetes, or that I would contract heart disease. I didn’t want to jeapordise my health, I wanted to be able to run around after my little boy,' she said.

So in March this year Marie went under the knife and had gastric surgery, which reduced the size of her stomach by three-quarters and limited how much she can eat.

Just six months after the surgery she slimmed down from a size 26 to a size 14 and dropped more than a third of her body weight - losing seven stone.

Comfort eater: Marie used to binge on takeaways and pasties but knew she had to change her lifestyle so she could be a more active and healthy mum to her son

She now weighs 12st 7lbs and said she has never felt better.

She said: 'I’ve got so much more confidence and self esteem. I’ve got a million times more energy and can be the mum I’ve always wanted to be.

'I now take him swimming and we go on bike rides and for walks on the beach. Best of all I can have proper cuddles with my son now, because he can finally wrap his little arms around me. It’s the best feeling in the world.'
