Insulting: Andrew Robathan has angered the Second World War heroes

A minister yesterday likened the campaign for Arctic convoy medals to Colonel Gaddafi being ‘covered in’ honours.

Andrew Robathan angered Second World War veterans by saying Britain did not ‘throw around’ honours like the Libyan tyrant and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

The Tory defence minister said the UK only awarded medals for ‘risk and rigour’ – prompting accusations he was ‘belittling’ the sacrifice made by thousands.

Mr Robathan made the ‘sickening’ remarks as those who risked their lives on what Winston Churchill described as ‘the worst journey in the world’, took their fight for a medal to Westminster.

More than 3,000 UK sailors, who faced treacherous seas where temperatures plunged as low as -60c, died to keep the Soviet Union supplied and fighting on the Eastern Front.

Of 1,400 ships on 78 convoys, 85 merchant and 16 Royal Navy vessels perished between 1941 and 1945.

If the convoys of cargo and munitions had failed, Germany could have defeated the Red Army and turned the full might of its military machine against Britain.

Despite the Tories promising to strike an Arctic Star medal when they won power, ministers have so far snubbed those who served on the convoys.

Even Russia has awarded commemorative medals to survivors. Only around 200 veterans are still alive.

Caroline Dinenage, Tory MP for Gosport in Hampshire, used a Westminster Hall debate at Parliament to tell Mr Robathan it would be ‘utterly, utterly disgusting’ if the heroes went to their graves without being honoured.

Insisting it was an ‘insult’ ministers had not kept their promise, she added: ‘It brings shame on our country.

‘At their age they should not have to fight for justice and it appals me that people who gave up so much to ensure the freedoms we take on a daily basis for granted should have to beg for the recognition that they deserve.’

But Mr Robathan suggested the campaign was similar to notorious regimes which handed out so many medals it diminished their worth.

He said: ‘The intention post-war was not to cover everybody in medals. Medals in the UK mean something.

‘Authoritarian regimes and dictators often throw around a lot of medals.

One can look, for instance, at North Korean generals who are covered in medal ribbon, or Gaddafi, or Saddam Hussein.

‘We have taken the view in this country, traditionally, that medals will only be awarded for campaigns that show risk and rigour.

'Some regimes give out very large numbers of medals whereas we, traditionally, do not.’

Mr Robathan’s comments infuriated veterans watching the debate.

Commander Eddie Grenfell, 91, the leader of the Arctic Medal campaign, said: ‘The man is a disgrace.

Veterans are outraged that their campaign has been likened to former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's ostentatious display

‘It was absolutely disgusting to speak of us in the same breath as Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein.

'They made a promise when they were looking for our votes and now they have betrayed us.’

Miss Dinenage said: ‘It sickens me that the veterans had to listen to those comments.

'They have demonstrated levels of heroism the minister could not begin to understand.’

Late last night Mr Robathan tried to calm the row, saying: ‘There was no intention to cause any offence.

'I was making the point that we honour people for their service in a very different way to that of authoritarian regimes.’

Successive governments have rejected pleas for an Arctic medal, claiming the sailors had already been recognised with the separate Atlantic Star medal.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Government would be holding ‘a fresh review of the rules governing the award of military medals’.

Battered by waves as high as houses, the ships sailed on through the darkness, fog and appalling cold of the Arctic winter.

But the weather was as nothing compared with the fear of being attacked by German warplanes, battleships and U-boats.

A
total of 78 convoys delivered four million tons of vital cargo and 
munitions to the Soviet Union – allowing the Red Army to repel the Nazi 
invasion.

The cost in 
lives was horrific. More than 3,000 UK seamen were killed in the 
treacherous waters of the Arctic Ocean as they undertook the terrifying 
trips to keep Russia supplied and fighting on the Eastern Front.

In total, 85 merchant and 16 Royal Navy vessels perished between 1941 and 1945.

But
the cost had the Arctic convoys not succeeded would have been worse: 
Nazi Germany would very probably have won the Second World War.

Churchill proposed the convoys following Operation Barbarossa, Germany’s invasion of Russia.

Cabinet
documents reveal that Britain’s greatest prime minister promised to 
supply Stalin ‘at all costs’. He knew that if Russia fell, the full 
weight of the Nazi military machine would be targeted at the West.

Over
four years, the convoys delivered 7,000 warplanes, 5,000 tanks and 
other battlefield vehicles, ammunition, fuel, food, medicine and further
emergency supplies. Because Norway and the Baltic states had been 
captured by Germany, the only way to get the goods to Russia was through
the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel, both inside the Arctic 
Circle.

The first 
convoys set off from Iceland and Loch Ewe in the Scottish Highlands. Two
or three reached their destination unscathed. But then the Germans ‘got
wise’ to the missions, said Eric Alley, 88, who served as a radar 
operator on HMS Inglefield.

‘After
they woke up, all hell broke loose. They shifted all their most able 
Luftwaffe squadrons and U-boats to Norway and we’d be under constant 
attack from the air and sea,’ said Mr Alley, from Weymouth, Dorset.

‘You’d
hear a horrible bang and one of the ships would disappear. Once I was 
moving across the deck and there was a huge explosion. I saw a column of
smoke and fire and one of the ships start to sink. The poor blighters 
on board didn’t stand a chance. We heard ships call for help but 
couldn’t do anything about it.’

Mr Alley, who made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943, said conditions on board were ‘pretty terrible’.

He
learned the hard way about the freezing temperatures when the skin on 
his hand was ripped off as he accidentally grabbed a ladder.

The
final convoy departed from the Clyde on May 12, 1945, and arrived at 
Kola Inlet, near Murmansk, on May 20. It sailed back into Glasgow ten 
days later.

Victory in Europe had been declared on May 8 – not least thanks to the sacrifice of the heroes of the Arctic convoys.
