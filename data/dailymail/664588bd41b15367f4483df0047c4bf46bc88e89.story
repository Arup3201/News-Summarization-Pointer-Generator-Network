Oscar Pistorius appears to have enjoyed a complex love life.

His first girlfriend was his high school sweetheart Vicky Miles with whom he appears to have had an off-on relationship.

Having got together in 2006, the pair split two years later but then reunited a short while afterwards. They broke up again last year.

Throughout the whole of last year however Pistorius also dated Cape Town marketing student and part-time model Samantha Taylor.

Last October the stunning blonde, who 
was then aged 18, appeared as Pistorius' girlfriend with the sports star
 on local television show Top Billing.

The glossy lifestyle programme accompanied the pair on a glitzy holiday in the Seychelles. 

At
 around the same time of year, a New York newspaper suggested Pistorius 
was going out with leggy Russian model Anastassia Khozissova.

Pistorius
 was first seen with Reeva Steenkamp at an awards ceremony in South 
Africa last November. Initially, the model said the pair were 'just 
friends'.

But when it became clear that Pistorius and Miss Steenkamp were in fact dating, the sportsman's then ex Samantha Taylor lashed out: 'Oscar has such a way with women. She’s probably not the only one he’s got.'

Miss Taylor went on to tell South Africa's City Press newspaper that 'Oscar is certainly not what people think he is'.

'We have considered our client’s communication with you and request you to disregard it. Our client withdraws her statements,' Taylor’s lawyer wrote to the paper.

Pistorius has, at various times, also been linked to at least three other South African women: Jenna Edkins, Melissa Rom and Chanelle du Plessis.  All are young, attractive and blonde.
