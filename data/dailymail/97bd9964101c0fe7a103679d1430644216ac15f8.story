Distraught: Kacy-Jo Frasca has discovered a stranger can see every update she makes on her iPhone

A 3 Mobile customer has been left distraught after discovering that everything she puts on her iPhone can be viewed by a complete stranger.

Home care manager Kacy-Jo Frasca, 23, was contacted by a man who claimed he can see all of her photos and emails because he was resold her old handset which is still linked to her iCloud account.

Ms Frasca had bought a new iPhone back in March from the Gloucester town centre 3 Mobile store but returned it the following day after discovering it had a faulty screen.

She was promptly given a new iPhone and thought nothing more of it until she was contacted last week by the stranger who told her he can see everything she uploads on to her handset.

It appears the man from London has been resold her rejected iPhone with the faulty screen by 3 Mobile without it being properly wiped by the mobile network.

Now she believes both her new phone and the faulty one are both linked to her ‘iCloud' account, which automatically uploads pictures, video and other documents to Apple servers.

The man described personal photos and videos that he could view on the phone - some Ms Frasca has only uploaded recently and several months after she returned the handset to 3 in March this year.

Ms Frasca, from Coney Hill, Gloucester, said: 'I'm incredibly worried about it as he can access all of my personal information.

'I had an app for my bank installed on that phone and he can see all of my emails and access any data he wants.

Invasion of privacy: A man from London who Miss Frasca has never met before can see all her personal photos after he was resold her old iPhone by 3 Mobile that she claims wasn't properly wiped

'There are some very personal pictures on there that are very private. Photos of me, some of my brother who has passed away, links to my bank accounts, everything.

'I have a lot of pictures of my brother's grave after he died just a few weeks after he returned from serving in Iraq.

Linked: It appears that both her old and current handset are still linked to her iCloud account

'That isn't something I want a stranger to see.'

She said the man has promised to keep all of her information safe while 3 Mobile look into the matter.

Ms Frasca added: 'The man called saying he would be furious if this had happened to him and he wanted me to know what was happening.

'While he has promised not to do anything with the information I still can't help feeling uneasy about it.

'My phone has my entire life on it.

'I called Apple and 3 Mobile and they both said it was impossible for this to happen but I know it's not.

'Apple said it may be because the old mobile hasn't been wiped properly and my iCloud account could still be automatically updating it but they said this was down to the phone company - not them.

'I'm now just waiting for 3 Mobile to get back me. I’m just so worried and stressed out.

'It seems ridiculous this could happen and they can’t do anything about it. I want other people to know it could happen to them.'

Miss Fresca was told by iPhone manufacturer Apple to contact her network provider 3 about the complaint.

She was also advised to use the Find my iPhone application to wipe her details from the old phone remotely but she said she struggled to get the app to work.

A spokesman for 3 Mobile said: 'We're investigating the case.

'What has been described should not happen and we will work with the customer to resolve this.'
