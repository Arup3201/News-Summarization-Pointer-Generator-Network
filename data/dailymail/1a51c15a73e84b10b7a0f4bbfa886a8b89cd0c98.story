What happens when you put players as skilled as Gareth Bale, Zinedine Zidane and Lucas Moura together in David Beckham's house?

A trophy cabinet gets broken.

The four footballers, brought together by adidas for the 'all in or nothing' campaign, were filmed by esteemed Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles, best known for hit film City of God. 

Quick game? Bale and Moura play each other at FIFA 14 on the Sony Playstation

The clip begins with Lucas sniggering as he and Bale take each other on in a video game as Beckham and Zidane look on.

Seemingly bored of not being involved, Becks kicks the ball at Lucas before challenging the Brazil international to play for real.

The foursome swiftly jump to their feet, slide the furniture away and play commences.

Zidane races across the sofa to latch onto Bale's chip but volleys the ball right toward's David Beckham's precious trophy cabinet which smashes to the ground.

Mind that cabinet! Bale attempts to control the ball

The former Real Madrid and Manchester United midfielder can't believe it and asks 'What's happened?'

'22 years of hard work. Guys this is not good,' says Becks.

However, the 39-year-old isn't down for long, quickly spinning on the ball and getting the kickabout going again!

Becks give Lucas the eyes before nutmegging him to give the ball to his former Madrid team-mate 'Zizou'.

Clearly not deterred by breaking his 
friend's trophy cabinet, Zidane then thumps the ball at a large black 
chandelier which crashes to the ground.

All smiles: Bale has a laugh with the film crew backstage

'Football 
stars are so used to being filmed that they've almost become actors. I 
was amazed to see how collaborative they were,' said Meirelles.

'Now
 that Beckham is retired from playing football, he could easily move his
 career straight to acting if he wanted and I mean that. 

'That day's shoot was pure fun.'

Action! Bale and Moura prepare to shoot a scene
