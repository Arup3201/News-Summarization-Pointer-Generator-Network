Blown away: Shocked Jessica Parsons had to leave a pub when a bouncer thought she had taken cocaine

Pub staff kicked out two women who blew their noses - because they thought they were using cocaine.

Nursery worker Jessica Parsons, 23, refused to let the common cold stop her from enjoying a night out with two friends at a pub in Cheam, Surrey.

But when she and one of her friends blew their noses in the toilet, they were accused of taking Class A drugs.

A female bouncer confronted them when they left their cubicles and ordered them to leave.

Shocked Miss Parsons says she will never return to the pub, which she has been visiting since she was 18.

The incident happened on Saturday night at the Harrow Inn, where staff have defended their actions.

Miss Parsons said: 'It was about half nine and we went to the toilet. Because we both had colds we both blew our noses while we were in there. We weren’t in the same cubicle or anything like that.

'As we left, one of the female bouncers pulled us back and said "come with us".

'They said there was a drug problem and that they heard us sniffing drugs in there.

'I told them I blew my nose because I have a cold and laughed because I thought it was a joke - I don’t even smoke, let alone do cocaine!

'We both have respectable jobs and we just wanted to go out for a quiet drink. I work in a school, there is no way I would risk that.

'I asked them to call the police but they wouldn’t and they just told us to leave, so we had to go and leave a bottle of wine we’d just bought on the table.'

Miss Parsons said she has been going to the pub regularly since she was 18, but now plans never to return.

A manager at the pub, who declined to give his full name asking only to be identified as Sam, said: 'We have a high rate of drugs issues in the area and our place is one of the red alert places.

'We have three door staff who will deal with situations when there is the slightest suspicion. If, in this case, we have made a mistake then it would be the first time.

'We are a lively pub so in terms of security we can’t be too careful.'

However, the two women did not let the incident bring their evening to a halt.

After being kicked out, they continued the night at All Bar One in nearby Sutton.
