Kate Moss looks fantastic in wellies — and so does my 14-year-old niece. So why do I always resemble a flat-footed troll when I pull on my ancient black pair?

According to Sarah Longthorn, founder of fashion brand Wedge Welly, my mistake is that my welly wardrobe is woefully out of date. ‘Choosing the right pair of rubber boots is as important as finding that perfect leather pair,’ she says. ‘All of us want wellies that make us feel good, especially in a long winter.’

So wellies, it seems, are no longer just a practical choice for country walks and gardening. They can be fashionable, too.

Newly informed, here is my pick of this winter’s selection on the High Street . . .

Original tall high heel boot, £135, Hunterboots.com

A welly with a high heel. Are they mad? But that’s what Hunter has come up with this autumn. The towering rubber boots, which raise you 4in above the mud, are surprisingly flattering and make feet look tiny and almost cartoon like. That’s something your average welly never does. But I felt self-conscious in them and they’re not very comfortable because my foot slid forward. In fact, they made me totter, so I didn’t risk a dog walk. If you’re planning to stride out in these at Glastonbury next summer, let’s hope the heels don’t get stuck in the mud. 2/5

Lady Bainbridge quilted wellies, £60, Regatta.com

If, like me, you get chilly feet then this faux fur lined pair are a canny choice. Though cosy, they’re elegant and sturdy enough for a country romp. I love the chestnut brown colour and the quilted upper fits snugly. Looked great with jeans, skirts or dresses. 5/5

Floral calf wellington boots, £13, Asda.com

Bring a splash of colour to jeans or trousers. They hit mid-calf, which is not flattering with skirts, but are snug on the foot. Good value, though the rubber is quite thin and wrinkles when you walk. 4/5

Original tall wellingtons, £90, Hunterboots.com

Favoured by the fashion set, they make short legs look elongated. A little loose, but stylish. 4.5/5

Polka-dot mid-calf welly, £36.95, Joules.com

Playfully natty, they’re comfy and good for walkers. Overall, very pleasant to wear. 4/5

Aqua rain boots, £45, Havaianas-store.com

A fun colour, but don’t reach very high, so my feet looked long and my legs stumpy. 2/5

Black rider wellington boots, £40, Next.co.uk

A welly that looks like a winter boot. A smart choice for trudging to work. Fits the leg well. 4/5

Longboat wellies, £39.95, seasaltcornwall.co.uk

Flattering length, good fit and the washable red laces are stylish. They look good with a skirt. 5/5

Heeled welly, £35, Wedgewelly.co.uk

A welly with a wedge seems absurd, but I loved this shiny pair. The wedge is comfortable and acts as a bouncy shock absorber. They have an excellent grip in a muddy field. 4.5/5

Red Herring leopard-print rubber wellies, £35, Debenhams.com

The print is bang on trend and looks great with jeans. Go down a size for the best fit or wear thick socks. Wide at the top, but adjustable. 3.5/5

Biker wellies, £55, Boden.co.uk

Buckles and pink zip detail show potential, but they are not chunky enough to pass as a biker boot. They are rather dainty looking at the front with a pointed toe and the heel is too low, so I felt flat-footed. Disappointing. 2.5/5
