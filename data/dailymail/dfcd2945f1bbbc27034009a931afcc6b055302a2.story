Darren Bent is set to sign for Derby County until the end of the season to boost the Championship side’s promotion ambitions and end his time at Aston Villa.

The former England striker will meet head coach Steve McClaren on Friday and should pen his deal once the transfer window opens on Saturday.

Bent, 30, will not be able to feature in Derby’s FA Cup match against Southport as players must be registered with the FA by midday on Friday – but he would be available for the key game against Ipswich at Portman Road on January 10.

The short-term transfer should bring to an end Bent’s Aston Villa career, with his £65,000 per week contract expiring in the summer. He moved to Villa Park in January 2011 at a cost of £18million and has scored 25 goals in 72 games.

Bent spent last season on loan at Fulham and had a brief spell at Brighton this campaign, scoring twice in five matches. Brighton paid £18,000 of his wages and Derby are likely to be contributing a similar amount.

Bent is believed to have chosen Derby ahead of other clubs for football reasons. McClaren will believe he can re-invigorate a striker who could add a timely cutting edge to Derby’s bid for Premier League football. McClaren handed Bent two of his 13 England caps during his time as national manager.
