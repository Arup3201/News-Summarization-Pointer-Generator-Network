The number of complaints about postmen leaving cards to say residents weren't in when they tried to deliver packages, when in fact the householders were home, has risen by more than a third.

The cards are meant to be used by postmen if they knocked on the door to deliver a parcel and received no response from the resident.

However, it appears the cards are being increasingly misused, pre-prepared by postmen seeking to lighten their loads and save time on their rounds.

Actually, I was in: The number of complaints about postmen leaving 'Sorry, you were out cards' when residents were home has risen by a third in two years

In 2011, 32,000 people complained about being left a
P739 form, better known as a 'Sorry, you were out' card, a 14 per cent 
rise.

Between June and September last year 
alone, more than 8,500 people complained about the practice, which 
represents a 37 per cent increase in the same period in 2009.

The figures show that the practice is on the rise despite promised by Royal Mail to curb the problem.

A 2009 study found that Royal Mail staff were routinely leaving 'Sorry, you were out' cards without even knocking doors.

Some sorting office managers have allocated just 10 seconds per house on new delivery routes, the postal workers union CWU has claimed.Â 

It has led to postmen filling out the forms before they approach houses because they do not have enough time to complete their rounds.

'When we heard the allegations that 
people were not ringing the door bell, we reminded staff they have to 
ring and wait for people to answer the door, a spokesman for Royal Mail 
told the Daily Telegraph.

A spokesman for CWU acknowledged that 
pressure to finish greater deliveries and in some cases insufficient 
time built into delivery times was a factor in the increase in cards 
being left.

But she also said there had been a 
huge rise in the number of packets, largely from internet shopping, 
being delivered, which require more door knocking and therefore more 
cards being issued.

She also said over the past three 
years deliveries had been pushed back later and people were more likely 
to be out with the later delivery start times.

A
snap survey of sorting offices by the Daily Mail, taken in 
mid-December, revealed queues of customers waiting to pick up parcels.

Many left empty-handed because they were too busy to wait up to 90 minutes in the Christmas rush, while others reached the counter only to be told their item couldn't be found.

A variety of reasons were given for 
the delays. Frustrated customers said the queues could have been avoided
if Royal Mail had put on extra staff to handle the workload.

And while some parcels may have 
genuinely been too big for letterboxes, or needed to be signed for, a 
significant number of customers complained that they had been at home 
when their postman shoved a notice through their door and drove off.

North Shields, North Tyneside, saw 
waits of 20 minutes, while customers in Bristol waited for over an hour 
in temperatures of 5c. In Cambridge, the delays topped 90 minutes as 70 
people stood in line.

'You can never park here so I had to walk,' she complained.

Royal Mail apologised to customers who
have 'experienced difficulties' but stressed that it has taken steps to
improve its service, such as extending opening hours for 1,400 offices 
and carrying out deliveries that require a signature on Sundays to catch
people at home.

The company has been criticised for 
curtailing collections and deliveries while hiking prices and pursuing 
other money-spinning ventures.

It emerged this year that the firm was seeking a five-fold increase in revenue from junk mail deliveries as profits slumped.
