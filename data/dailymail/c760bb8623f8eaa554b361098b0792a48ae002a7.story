Intoxicated: Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett was arrested on Wednesday after being brought into custody for refusing to cooperate with police at Minneapolis-St. Paul airport

It has been revealed that troubled Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett was fueled by a potent cocktail of prescription drugs and vodka when he was arrested at a Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport bar on Wednesday.

Admitting to police that he had started drinking at 9am that morning, the troubled 59-year-old journalist was taken into custody at 12.39pm at the Northern Lights Grill in the airport's main terminal.

Once in jail, Jarrett, who was carrying papers indicating that he had just been released from rehab, launched into a furious and confrontational tirade at police, repeatedly screaming, 'f*** you', before officers physically restrained and cuffed him.

He remained in Hennepin County Jail until around 1:30 a.m. Thursday and was released on $300 bond.

Officers arrived at the bar after a bartender called about Jarrett, who appeared to be extremely drunk.

Jarrett had only been served one drink and was making another customer feel uncomfortable, admitting to them that he had taken medication before his flight.

The Fox News anchor appeared mentally agitated and had trouble replying to any questions asked of him with more than one word answers.

He repeatedly denied any request from officers to see his ID and was clearly swaying wildly while seated at the bar - using his arm to grab the bar to keep from falling off his stool.

Described as being in a 'fog', Jarrett's unwillingness to cooperate led officers to taken him into custody because 'he would be unable to properly care for himself.'

At this point, Jarrett was not handcuffed and while he was walked to the squad car, he was overhead mumbling 'sorry' over and over.

Admitting he had been drinking since the morning, officers searched his bag and found three pills identified as Gabapentin - which is used to treat seizures and bi-polar disorder.

Jarrett did not have any prescriptions for the drugs on him and evidence was found that revealed he had just been released from rehab.

However, once in custody, Jarrett's mood turned ugly and when he was being evaluated by medical staff he began to scream, 'This is your fault' at the arresting officer.

'His body became rigid and he leaned forward like he was going to jump up on his feet or launch himself off of the bench,' said arresting officer, Mark Dorsey.

'He yelled, 'f*** you!' and at this point, police felt that Jarrett was a danger to himself and others and went to cuff him.

He resisted this, so he had to be physically restrained by more than two officers who managed to subdue him.

Jarrett was then arrested andÂ  booked on a preliminary charge of obstructing the legal process by interfering with a peace officer, which is a misdemeanor.

His 
bond was set at $300. Records show he's due in court on June 6.

A
 representative of Fox News issued a statement Thursday morning about 
the arrest at the airport bar. The bar is shown below in a picture 
supplied by RSP Architects.

'We
 were made aware late last night that Gregg Jarrett was arrested in 
Minneapolis yesterday and charged with a misdemeanor,' the network 
spokesperson said. 'He is dealing with serious personal issues at this 
time. A date at which Gregg might return to air has yet to be 
determined.'

On
 May 12, Jarrett, who has two daughters with wife Catherine Kennedy 
Anderson, requested time off from Fox News for 'personal reasons,' 
according to TV Newser, and the network granted his request.
