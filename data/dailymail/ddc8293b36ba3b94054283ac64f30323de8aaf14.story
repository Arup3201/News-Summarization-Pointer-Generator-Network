Oscar Pistorius, nicknamed 'Blade Runner',  made history this morning by becoming the first double amputee to compete in an Olympic Games when he ran in the 400 metre heat.

Pistorius,  a four-time Paralympic champion who runs on carbon-fiber blades, circled the oval in 45.44 seconds - good enough for second place in his heat and a berth in the semifinals Sunday night.

Although it was not his personal best, Pistorius who is representing South Africa he said after the race: 'On the blocks I didn't know whether to cry or be happy.'

The 25-year-old runner was born without fibulas and his legs were amputated below the knee before he was a year old.

'I know Oscar was the protagonist in the race,' said Luguelin Santos of the Dominican Republic, who actually won the heat by .4 but went virtually unnoticed. 'But I love him. He's a good racer.'

When asked his about his success, he paid tribute to his coach and his team saying: 'It just means my coach has done a great job. We have been together for 9 years.

'I have run so many times n the Uk this crowd feels like a second home to me,' he added.

The 25-year-old had looked set to miss out on a place in the individual event after failing to run a second 'A' qualifying time to gain automatic selection.

Oscar wears the Ossur Cheetah Flex-foot Artificial Sprinting Leg

Cost approx £1,300

Made of carbon fibre, manufactured in Iceland

Each blade weighs 512g (18.1oz)

The prosthesis’ ‘J’ curve shape resembles the hind quarter of a cheetah, the fastest animal on land

He only has one pair — he trains and competes in the same blades — and he’s been using the current pair since 2003

If they were to break, he’d be scuppered... but they won’t

Spikes are taken from an ordinary Nike shoe

Knee sockets are moulded specially around Oscar’s joints, with additional soft cushioning

He fell agonisingly short at his 
final attempt in July, but was selected for his country's 4x400m relay 
team - in which he won a silver medal at the World Championships last 
year - which meant he could be selected for the individual event.

Earlier this week Pistorius delivered
a staunch defence of his participation at the Olympics, hitting back at
critics who think his prosthetic legs give him a racing advantage.

Some critics, including four-time 
Olympic champion and BBC pundit Michael Johnson, have said he should not
be racing. Pistorius calmly put the record straight.

‘I know Michael Johnson quite well 
and he and I have chatted many, many times,’ said the 25-year-old, who 
is expected to reach the semi-finals of the event.

‘I have a lot of respect for him. He 
is concerned about the development of prosthetic legs. But the ones I 
have are the same ones athletes have been using since 1996. I’ve had the
same ones since I started running in 2004.

Strong words: Some critics, including four-time Olympic champion and BBC pundit Michael Johnson, have said Pistorius should not be racing

‘And if the blades give so much of an
advantage then why aren’t other athletes who have them running as fast 
as me?'

People say I must have an advantage because my legs are lighter. 
But I’ve got less blood running through them and don’t have the tendons 
in my ankles. People don’t talk about that.

‘I’m sure they could make a 
prosthetic leg that would give people an advantage but I believe in 
fairness and I’m happy using the ones I have. And they make sure of that
because I can’t change it anyway because of the Court of Arbitration 
for Sport ruling.’

Pistorius is aiming to break the 
45-second barrier in London, something which has eluded him so far — his
best is 45.07sec — and the South Africans should excel in the relay too
having won silver at last year’s World Championships. Pistorius will be
allowed to run any leg of the relay, a change from Daegu where it was 
considered his blades might injure race rivals.

‘Any improvements since I’ve started 
have not been from any aid or any changes made. They’ve been through 
hard training and a lot of sacrifice,’ Pistorius added.

‘What I believe in is the fairness of
sport. It isn’t an advantage. In my heart, I know what’s right and I 
wouldn’t be running if I had any doubt.’
