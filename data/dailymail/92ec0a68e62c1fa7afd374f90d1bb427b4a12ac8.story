The iconic wedding dress worn by Elizabeth Taylor when she married Conrad 'Nicky' Hilton Jr smashed all estimates to sell for more than £120,000 at auction today.

Taylor wore the iconic gown, made by 
costume designer Helen Rose, when she walked down the aisle in 1950 to marry Hilton Jr, the first of her eight weddings, when she was just 18 years old.

A fierce bidding war at Christie’s auction house in London saw the dress, which Elizabeth Taylor was given by MGM after she starred in 'Father of the Bride' in 1950, sell for more than twice the highest estimate.

A round of applause rippled through the prestigious South Kensington auction house when a telephone bidder snapped up the coveted gown.

The intricately designed dress, decorated with pearls, took 15 people up to three months to create

Christie’s director Nicolette 
Tomkinson said: 'We were honoured to have been asked to handle the sale 
of this iconic wedding dress, which represents an important piece of 
Hollywood history.

'Designed
by Helen Rose, one of the most celebrated film costumiers of the time, 
as a gift from M.G.M. Studios, and inspired by the wedding dress worn by
Taylor in M.G.M.’s ‘Father of the Bride’, the dress is inextricably 
tied to the Golden Age of Hollywood, as well as to the extraordinary 
life and career of the star who wore it.

'Since
it was unveiled, it has attained global appreciation, resulting in 
competitive bidding for it today. The dress was sold for £121,875 
reflecting its significance in the history of film and fashion.'

When she married Hilton Elizabeth 
was already a veteran actress and celebrated star and was just a year 
away from her Oscar-nominated performance in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
(MGM) 1951 film A Place in the Sun.

The
Hollywood 'wedding of weddings' was the social event of the year. MGM 
boasted 'more stars than there are in heaven' attended, with the 
700 guests representing the A-list of classic Hollywood, including Greer
Garson, Gene Kelly, Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire, Esther Williams and 
Van Johnson.

The beautiful dress was itself a gift from MGM to the teenage bride, and it was so revered that photographs of it have appeared all over the world; from newspapers and tabloids to LIFE magazine.

With its twenty five yards of 
shell-white satin embellished with bugle beads and seed pearls, trailed 
by a fifteen-yards of satin train, it is exactly the kind of elegant 
design for which Helen Rose was known.

Everything about this gown was custom-designed with Elizabeth Taylor's voluptuous figure in mind; a built-in corset allowed the dress to be tightly cinched in at the waist and the veil's ten yards of shimmering silk net was carefully considered and attached to a pearl-covered Juliet cap in order to float around the bride.

The original waist measured 20 inches, but it has since been taken out to a slightly more generous 22.

The project was so extensive and was such a priority at MGM that more than fifteen people worked full-time for between two and three months straight on it.

Helen Rose was known for always achieving Louis B. Mayer's order to 'just make them look beautiful' and for treating everyone with great respect.

She had extremely good relationships 
with all of her colleagues and clients and often designed their 
off-screen wardrobes, frequently including their wedding gowns.

Perhaps
her most famous was Grace Kelly's when she became the Princess of 
Monaco, a design that recently inspired the Duchess of Cambridge‟s 
wedding dress designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.

Few wedding dresses have as deep a historical connection to both film and fashion as this; it‟s an example of a legendary designer and star working together in perfect harmony and the result is something that has made a lasting impact on fashion.

Taylor's marriage to the Hilton Hotel heir
ended in divorce after just nine months because of his ‘gambling, 
drinking and abusive behaviour.’But while her marriage may have been ill fated the dress certainly isn’t.

The actress donated the gown to an 
auction in Beverly Hills in the 1960s where it was snapped up by a woman
who gave it to her granddaughter. She wore it at her wedding in 1974 
and remains happily married to this day.

The gown had been expected by experts to reach between £30,000 and £50,000.
