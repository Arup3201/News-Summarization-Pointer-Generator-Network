New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's recent spate of scandals are troublesome enough to get in the way of his mission as chairman of the powerful Republican Governors Association, former Virginia attorney general and losing 2013 gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli said Tuesday.

The RGA controls a $150 million purse collected to help Republicans win governor's races. Christie has the group's reins for a one-year term.

Cuccinelli referred to Christie's 'Bridgegate' scandal and claims that his administration used Hurricane Sandy relief dollars as political leverage, telling CNN that it 'makes sense' for him to step down.

'I think just from the perspective of – setting aside this as an issue in other races, it makes sense for him to step aside in that role,' Cuccinelli said.

'He does not serve the goals of that 
organization by staying as chairman. And that doesn’t mean any of the 
charges, political or otherwise, are substantive or not. It doesn’t 
matter. Perception is reality.'

Ken Cuccinelli came up short in his bid to be Virginia's governor, and now he's lashing out at Chris Christie, saying the scandal-plagued New Jersey pol should resign his chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association

Christie began his second term as New Jersey's chief executive on a snowbound Tuesday, while new questions swirl around his fitness to lead the GOP's group tasked with electing more Republican governors

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe beat Cuccinelli in a squeaker. He was U.S. President Bill Clinton's fundraising leader in the 1990s

Cuccinelli lost his bid to be Virginia's governor by less than 67,000 votes after closing a 10 per cent gap in the race's last weeks, bringing insiders to carp that the election was winnable but underfunded.

The RGA spent $8 million helping Cuccinelli, but choked off ad-buy dollars down the stretch.

Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the state's new governor, spent heavily on TV ads in the closing weeks of the contest.

On election night, Republicans carped at Christie for pulling out of Virginia while the RGA continued to lavish $1.7 million more to cement Christie's landslide win.

'I heard from one Republican source who said, "Where was Chris Christie?"' reported NBC's Chuck Todd from a McAuliffe's victory party.

'Apparently some senior conservative Republicans reached out to Christie and asked him to come down to Virginia and campaign for Cuccinelli and Christie said no. ... A lot of Cuccinelli supporters are a little bit bitter right now looking at the result, thinking, "What if?"'

CROSSFIRE: Cuccinelli took the bait when liberal commentator Van Jones asked if Christie should be bounced from the RGA

Christie (center-left) is beginning his second term in Trenton, N.J. while scandals and new investigations surround him, including an accusation that he ordered his lieutenant governor to use Superstorm Sandy federal relief dollars as bargaining chips so a commercial development would go forward

Ken Cuccinelli's camp believed that Christie could have won the race for them if he had shown up in person to campaign in Virginia -- and that the RGA torpedoed them by stopping the flow of money in the race's crucial final weeks

A bitter Cuccinelli reminded CNN's audience on Tuesday that the fallout from Christie's 'Bridgegate' is just beginning to settle.

'Frankly, I think this is still relatively new and he may well step down' from the RGA,' he said. 'I have no idea what his thinking is on that. And he may get some counsel from some other governors along those lines.'

Chris Christie took over the Republican Governors Association chairmanship after the 2013 election, but Cuccinelli blames him for not showing up in person to campaign in Virginia

The RGA itself did not respond to a request for comment. But long-time Christie adviser Mike DuHaime told the Associated Press that Cuccinelli's comments were 'disappointing, given the RGA was by far the largest single donor to his losing campaign, giving more than $8 million — a significant portion of which was raised by Gov. Christie.'

The embattled New Jersey Governor is already using his position in the RGA as a platform to raise money for Republicans in states that will be critical to the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

Christie is expected to announce a run for president by the middle of next year.

In the early days of the bridge scandal, centered on Christie aides who allegedly arranged for a traffic jam leading to the George Washington Bridge as revenge against a Democratic mayor in nearby Fort Lee, N.J., the RGA issued a strong statement of support for its leader.

'Governor Christie apologized to the people of New Jersey, the people of Fort Lee and to the members of the New Jersey legislature.' the group said.

'He made it clear that members of his team exhibited unacceptable conduct and a complete lack of respect for both the role of government and the people he is trusted to serve. He believes that when mistakes are made, you own up to them. That’s what leadership is about.'
