Cherished: Rifleman Sachin Limbu died on Monday

Tributes were paid today to a 'highly cherished' Gurkha soldier who died in hospital 18 months after being injured in an explosion in Afghanistan.

Rifleman Sachin Limbu, 23, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles, died at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on Monday.

He was injured when he was caught in the blast from an improvised explosive device in June 2010.

The soldier came from Rajghat, Morang in Nepal, and followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a Gurkha soldier.

His father was a Gurkha Senior NCO and he was brought up in the life and community of 7th Gurkha Rifles and later 2nd Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles in Hong Kong and Brunei.

In a statement released through the Ministry of Defence, his father, Dillisher Limbu, said: 'My wife and I are immensely proud of our only beloved son who has sacrificed his life for the good of others.

'Sachin was our only son and we both extend our sincere thanks to all the staff at The New Queen Elizabeth hospital and Brigade of Gurkhas who have supported us all so closely.'

Lieutenant Colonel David Robinson, Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, said the Rifleman's 'sacrifice has prevented him from fulfilling a rewarding career but his inspiring determination not to succumb to his injuries for so long was in the true sprit of those Gurkhas who have gone before him.

'He was highly cherished and loved by his fellow Gurkhas and left his mark on all those that had the honour to meet him.

'As the only son of a retired Gurkha 
this will have been devastating for his family; our thoughts and prayers
are with them at this difficult time.'

He added that the soldier had shown 'remarkable tenacity' in trying to overcome the injuries he had sustained on June 24 2010.

Rfn Limbu was deployed on Operation Herrick 12 with B (Sari Bari) Company, 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles as a machine gunner.

He was involved in a number of operations to stabilise the area of Walizi Village, many of which involved intense, protracted and close quarter combat in an area known to present a high risk from IEDs, the MoD said.

On June 24 2010 he was deployed on a patrol to Walizi as part of an operation to enable local national freedom of movement and deter insurgent activity in the area.

As they reached their objective, Rfn Limbu moved into a fire position to provide protection to his comrades and was caught in an explosion from a hidden IED.

Rfn Limbu, who passed the selection 
for the Brigade of Gurkhas in 2007, was evacuated to Birmingham's Selly 
Oak Hospital via Camp Bastion before being transferred to Queen 
Elizabeth Hospital where he died.

Lieutenant Colonel Gez Strickland, 
Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles on Operation 
Herrick 12, said: 'Rifleman Sachin Limbu has touched many of our lives.

'On operations in Afghanistan he 
represented everything that is good about our Gurkha soldiers. He was 
diligent, supportive to his friends and committed to what he was doing.

'He had a firm place in his Company and was counted as one of a select few. Since his injury a year and a half ago, he was nothing short of inspirational.

'I watched this young man deal with unimaginable pain and suffering, but all the time he maintained his strength and dignity.

'One of the proudest moments of my life was when he was presented his Afghan campaign service medal on his ward in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital last year, surrounded by his family, friends, and the wonderful staff there who cared for him so well.

'In hospital, he fought against incredible odds for a very long time with more courage than I have ever seen in another human being, helped at every step by his wonderful, loving parents. He was truly a special man.'

Major Dyanprasad Rai, Gurkha Major 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, said: 'Rifleman Sachin Limbu was a courageous and highly capable soldier who was dedicated to his profession.

'He has always been sincere and devoted towards his responsibilities as a soldier, in the best tradition of the Gurkha soldier.

'He was active in all that he did, thoughtful for those around him and incredibly loyal.

'His service within 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles will never be forgotten.'

Major Kushiman Gurung, Gurkha Major 1st Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles on H12, said: 'Riflemen Sachin Limbu was a true Gurkha soldier. He was loyal, determined, and enthusiastic and was always up for a challenge with a grin on his face.

'His cheerful attitude and determination made him an inspiring member amongst his fellow soldiers, who both admired and respected him. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him but his sacrifice will not be forgotten.'
