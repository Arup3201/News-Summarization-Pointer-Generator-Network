Battle: Just one of 20 living relatives of Huguette Clark, pictured, is not suing for part of her estate

Relatives of reclusive heiress Huguette Clark are just days away from battling over her $300 million estate - but there'll be one family member absent from the courtroom.

Victoria Sujata, a grandniece of the late copper heiress, is the only one of Clark's 20 living relatives who is not suing her for a share in the massive estate - and could miss out on a small fortune.

While her family fights a will that leaves millions to Clark's staff, Sujata has said that she believes the fight over the fortune is disrespectful to her late aunt, who died in May 2011, aged 104.

'I find the prospect of challenging my Aunt Huguette's will to be disrespectful of what could be her true wishes, an impolite act not in accordance with my values,' Sujata says in a new book about Clark, the New York Post reported.

The book, Empty Mansions: The 
Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American 
Fortune by Bill Dedman and one of Clark's relatives Paul Clark Newell 
Jr., lifts the lid on the fascinating family known for staying out of 
the limelight.

Sujata, a 66-year-old author of books about Tibetan texts, is quoted in the book under the name Clare Albert, her birth name.

She
says she disagrees with her family's claims that Clark was mentally 
ill, incompetent and coerced into signing away massive sums of money to 
galleries and her staff in 2005.

Gracious: Huguette was shy, but not sad. Her friends and the few relatives who knew her describe her as cheerful, gracious, stubborn, and devoted to her art. She poses at about age 37

They are arguing over the validity of the will, which left $45 million to a philanthropic organization, $34 million to Clark's nurse and $1 million to her lawyer and accountant.Â 

Sujata's two siblings are among those fighting it.

'I do, in fact, believe that my aunt well understood how she was dividing up her wealth and that her final will represents her own intentions,' she said.

Still, Sujata has still hired a lawyer to watch over the trial. Jury selection in the trial begins on Tuesday.

Of the 19 relatives now questioning the will, 14 
admit they never met their reclusive aunt.

The heiress to a copper, timber and railroad fortune had no children and spent the last 20 years of her life living at Beth Israel Medical Center until she died in 2011 aged 104.

The new biography offers tantalizing 
details about the French-born heiress who was fixated on 
life-like dolls and building miniature castles - often splashing out 
thousands of dollars to make them.

According to the Post,
one of the few people who visited Clark at her apartments in the 1950s 
said that a long gallery was lined with dolls, each seated on its own 
sumptuous armchair.

One of Ms Clark's few outings was to attend Christian Dior fashion shows in order to find clothes to dress her dolls.

The heiress was also obsessed with building miniature models.

A
lover of Japanese culture, although she never traveled, Clark paid for 
someone to travel to Japan to photograph and note the specifications of 
the castles she wanted to build from the confines of her mansion.

While she stayed at the hospital, her
three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a 
$24million country house in Connecticut and a $100million co-op, the 
largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park.

She
inherited her wealth from her father, Montana Senator William Clark, 
and his copper mines but regarded her great wealth as 'a menace to 
happiness'.

When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the only people present at her burial were funeral home employees.
