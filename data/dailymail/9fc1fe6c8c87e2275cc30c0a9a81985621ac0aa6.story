David Jones is considering starting its Boxing Day sales one week early to boost sales in a move that could force rival Myer to follow suit.

A source in the retail industry said the department store was preparing sale stock to put in stores ahead of Christmas due to slow sales in the past few weeks, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

This comes as New South Wales Planning Minister Pru Goward has taken the step of allowing shops in business districts in the CBD, Bondi Junction and western suburbs to stay open 24/7 until Christmas in order to help retailers pick up their sales.

Both David Jones and Myer are already offering deals on certain items, with David Jones currently offering 20 per cent off a range of home appliances, 40 per cent off Christmas wrapping and dinnerware, and other discounts on items including TVs, books, kitchenware and linen.

Myer is holding a 'Super Weekend' this weekend with discounts on electrical appliances, homewares and clothing.

This also comes after consumer sentiment hit a three-year low this December, down 5.7 percent from 96.6 in November to 91.1 in December.

Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said this was a 'very disturbing result'.

'This is a particularly awkward time for respondents to feel so downbeat about purchasing major items given that it comes in the critical lead up weeks to Christmas,' Mr Evans said.

This also comes consumer sentiment hit a three-year low this December

Commonwealth Bank economist Diana Mousina said this was in line with analysis they had done about Christmas shopping, which showed spending during the festive season would be down from $18.4 billion in 2013 to $17.8 billion in 2014.

The bank's National Consumer Expenditure survey showed shoppers would spend $300 million less on Christmas gifts and $100 million less on Boxing Day sales this year.

'Based on anecdotes from retailers, and just compared to a year ago and on usual Christmas sales it's just not happening as much as they would like,' Ms Mousina said.

'It's an issue of competition in the market, there are a lot of new entrants into clothing and footwear retail at the moment.

'[Stores] are just thinking of strategies to mitigate that.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted David Jones and Myer for comment.
