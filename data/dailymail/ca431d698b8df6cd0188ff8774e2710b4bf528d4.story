Mauricio Pochettino wants to impress the Tottenham fans when he takes charge of his first competitive match at the White Hart Lane helm on Sunday.

After an impressive 18-month stay at Southampton, the former Argentina international this summer penned a five-year deal to take charge at Spurs.

QPR are the opponents for Pochettino's first competitive home match as Tottenham manager on Sunday, when they will look to build on back-to-back away wins at West Ham and AEL Limassol against former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp.

'I am looking forward to it,' Pochettino said. 'We are looking forward to it, my first official game at White Hart Lane in front of our supporters.

'We hope that would be a good game and always to win. It is important to win and play well and develop our style and improve, which is important in each game. Try to improve.

'We watch a lot of games from them and the last game they played well but in football not always when you play well, you win.

'But, yes, it is a derby, we expect a very, very tough games.'

Pochettino will be without Kyle Naughton for the Hoops' visit through suspension, although Emmanuel Adebayor, Christian Eriksen, Younes Kaboul, Aaron Lennon and Etienne Capoue are available having been rested for the energy-sapping trip to Cyprus.

A terrible pitch and temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius made the first leg of the Europa League play-off against AEL a difficult evening for Tottenham.

It was a match they looked set to lose until the introduction of Erik Lamela after 72 minutes - a switch which directly led to goals for Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane.

The former's strike was a fantastic first-time effort and particularly important given his struggles in front of goal last season, although Pochettino played down the magnitude of the goal.

'Always goals are important for Harry and for Roberto,' he said. 'The strikers always need to score and it is important he scored and Harry scored.

'In the team, when the strikers score all the people are happy.'Â
