Motorists are likely to enjoy low petrol prices for the rest of the year, the boss of Shell is expected to say today.

Chief executive Ben van Beurden will say in a speech that prices look set to remain at their six-year low because of volatility in the global oil market.

The falling price has been described as a tax cut for consumers - helping end the cost of living crisis - with RAC analysis suggesting drivers would enjoy a £4billion windfall.

But Mr van Beurden will warn that oil prices will inevitably increase again as more supplies are needed to deal with the rising demand, according to The Telegraph.

Speaking at the International Petroleum Week dinner in London this evening, Mr van Beurden is expected to say: ‘The market will remain volatile in 2015, if only because for now, Opec [Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] shows no sign of wanting to resume its role as swing supplier.’

The falling prices have been welcome news for the public.

Yet Mr van Beurden is also expected to caution that a longer-term slump in oil prices could have potentially dire economic consequences.

Since June, the collapse of global oil prices and fierce competition between supermarkets has driven down prices at the pump.

The average price of unleaded currently £1.06 per litre – down from £1.33 last summer.

The RAC Foundation recently predicted that motorists could be at least £140 better off this year than if prices had stayed similar to last summer.
