Star Trek actor William Shatner has been forced into an embarrassing apology after joking on television that the coastal town of Ilfracombe is 'laced with prostitution'.

Shatner, who had been guest hosting the BBC's satirical quiz 'Have I Got News For You' last month, singled out the Devon town as a 'haven' for sex workers, to howls of laughter from panellists and the studio audience.

The 81-year-old made the ill-judged quip despite never having visiting the town, and drew a furious response from an Ilfracombe councillor, who wrote to Shatner personally.

Ill-judged: William Shatner's remark led to a letter from former mayor of Ilfracombe Paul Crabb (right), who subsequently received an apology from the veteran actor

On an episode of the show broadcast on
 May 28, Ilfracombe had been mentioned as an Olympic torch relay venue, 
causing Shatner to comically mispronounce its name and guest Charlie 
Brooker to note that it sounded 'deeply sexual'.

This
 led Shatner to joke that the town is 'laced with prostitution', drawing
 guffaws of shocked laughter from regular panellists Ian Hislop and Paul
 Merton.

Ilfracmbe is billed on its own tourism website as a Devon town with 'curious coastal charm'.

According to Trip Advisor, the top attraction in the seaside resort is the Tunnels Beaches, a network of hand-carved tunnels 'leading to unique sheltered beaches and tidal victorian bathing pool'.

Ilfracombe Museum, meanwhile, boasts 'natural history specimens from around the world, and so much to explore about Ilfracombe's past'.

Another attraction in the coastal town is Watermouth Castle, a castle which is also a family theme park with 'eclectic treasures, nostalgic displays and curios'.

Animal lovers might be tempted by the nearby Combe Martin Wildlife and Dinosaur Park, which features African lions, wolves, meerkats, penguins and exotic birds among its residents.

A final historical suggestion for visitors to the town is Larkstone Cafe and Leisure Park - a 1920s tennis club and tearoom which boasts views of Ilfracombe Harbour and the Bristol Channel.

Straight away 
Charlie Brooker suggested: 'That will be their new slogan now', while 
Paul Merton added: ''You try and buy a stick of rock there.'

Following the remark, town councillor Paul Crabb wrote to Shatner via his agent inviting him to the coastal town.

Mr
 Crabb said: 'As Captain James T Kirk, Mr Shatner has been to places 
where no man has gone before, however, the episode of HIGNFY clearly 
shows he has never been to Ilfracombe.

'If
 he came we could show him that there is no prostitution in Ilfracombe 
and that it is a lovely coastal town with spectacular scenery and a 
close community.'

In an email sent to Mr Crabb and signed 'Bill', Shatner wrote that prostitution 'commonly means sex for something of value.

'I would be hard pressed to believe that sex was not being had in Ilfracombe for something of value, perhaps a lengthy marriage, children or a valuable career.

'In any event, my apologies for having singled out Ilfracombe as a potential haven for prostitution. With you overseeing, I am sure that will not happen.'

The incident is the second time in less than a year that Ilfracombe has come in for a public slating.

Last September, a tourist complained of the 'foul stench' of fish his family were subjected to after walking past a trawler in the working harbour.

David Copp, 46, was with his children on a trip to Devon when he contacted authorities in the port of Ilfracombe to lodge a formal complaint about 12 crates of dead fish and crabs lining the harbour wall.
