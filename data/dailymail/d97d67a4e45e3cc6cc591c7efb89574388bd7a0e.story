Health campaigners last night demanded a full-scale inquiry into the meltdown in the Labour-run Welsh NHS.

The Daily Mail has uncovered appalling cases of patients dying while on waiting lists or being forced to move to England for life-saving treatment. 

Over the next few days, our investigation will expose horrifying neglect and a political establishment in denial.

Health campaigners have demanded an investigation into the Labour-run Welsh NHS. Ed Miliband intends to place running NHS at heart of Labour's election campaign next May - despite the party's dismal record 

Despite his party’s dismal record in Wales, Ed Miliband wants to place the running of the NHS at the heart of Labour’s election campaign next May. 

Yet families whose loved ones have suffered in Welsh hospitals say the situation is even worse than the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

The British Medical Association, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru nationalists and Labour MP Ann Clwyd are all demanding an independent inquiry. And a survey out today shows that seven out of ten voters agree.

The Mail’s investigation will reveal that:

Yesterday another scandal erupted at the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, where police are investigating claims that staff used furniture to restrain dementia patients.

The British Medical Association warned last month that the NHS in Wales was facing ‘imminent meltdown’ and called for an independent investigation. Last year the College of Emergency Medicine wrote to the Welsh health minister warning that casualty units were putting patients at risk.

And Sir Bruce Keogh of NHS England wrote to his Welsh counterpart last November warning six hospitals should be probed over ‘persistently high’ mortality rates.

Today’s survey, commissioned by the Welsh Conservatives, found that a third of people with recent experience of hospital treatment had encountered problems and nearly one in five felt their concerns were not taken seriously.

It found that 71 per cent back an independent inquiry into the NHS and 60 per cent believe their health service has deteriorated over the past five years.

Respondents included a retired nurse who complained that senior managers were too afraid to act on bad practice.

An orthopaedic consultant who answered the questionnaire said Wales’s NHS was ‘on the verge of becoming a third-world health service’.

The research was based on 3,295 responses to a survey posted online and sent to 5,000 homes chosen at random.

Gareth Williams has campaigned to expose failings at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University health board in South Wales after his mother Lilian suffered neglect before her death in hospital. 

‘I believe the indifference of government ministers in Cardiff is callous,’ said the 54-year-old retired teacher.

‘They can no longer hold up the pretence that there are only isolated concerns in ABMU or Wales. In Wales we are still in denial. I think we are where England was when the Mid Staffs scandal broke.’

Hundreds of patients died through neglect at Stafford Hospital. Mr Williams said he and fellow campaigners have been contacted by seven whistleblower nurses.

Miss Clwyd has described how her husband died like a ‘battery hen’ at University Hospital Wales in October 2012.

She highlighted high mortality rates at some Welsh hospitals and long waiting times for diagnostic tests.

A spokesman for the Cardiff administration said: ‘The vast majority of people in Wales receive excellent care from our NHS, which is more open, transparent and is subjected to a higher level of scrutiny than any other health service in the UK. If issues are identified, we work quickly to put them right.’

A spokesman for the ABMU health board said: ‘The vast majority of patients receive good quality care – our complaints rate over the past year was 0.15 per cent – but we know that any poor care is unacceptable and we are determined to put things right.’
