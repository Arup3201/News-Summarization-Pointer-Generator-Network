If you want to keep your browsing history a secret, or you’re paranoid about being tracked, you can enable private mode.

But, doing so usually means having to manually enable the mode from the start.

Google is hoping to automate this process with its latest patent, which aims to switch to private browsing every time a new session starts, or when a website asks for particular information.

Google's patent (pictured) describes a system that could automatically open private browsing windows, or a user could ask that certain sites are always only opened in Incognito Mode. Alternatively, if Google detects that a site is asking for credit card details, it could switch to private browsing by default

The patent was originally filed in 2011, but was only awarded this week.

A web browser tracks a user by storing information as the user browses web pages.

In November, Firefox launched a Forget button. 

The button can be added to the browser and will automatically delete browsing history. 

Users can ask Firefox to automatically delete information from the past five minutes, two hours or 24 hours.

This means that all cookies, history, tabs and windows are deleted - and can't be recovered.

This includes browsing history, images, videos, text, and other data on these pages, as well as any files that are downloaded.

As a result, browsers offer a privacy mode so the user can browse without being tracked.

On Google’s Chrome, this is called Incognito Mode, while on Firefox it’s known as Private Browsing.

Google’s patent describes a system that could either automatically open a private browsing window each time, or a user can ask that certain websites are always only opened in Incognito Mode.

Alternatively, if Google detects that a website is asking for credit card details, or other personal information, it will switch to private browsing by default.

As the files explained: ‘[Patent] relates to equipping a web browser with the ability to automatically open web pages in a privacy mode based on content of the web pages so that a user is not required to manually activate the privacy mode.

‘The web browser is able to identify characteristics of the content provided by the web pages by analysing the web pages for content that increases the likelihood that the user may require that the web page be opened in the privacy mode.’

The news follows the launch of a Forget button for the Firefox browser.

To add the Forget button, click Menu and select Customise at the bottom of the menu panel.

Drag the Forget button  from the Additional Tools and Features panel to the toolbar. 

Users can then ask it to automatically delete browsing history from the past five minutes, two hours or 24 hours. 

Or, they can hit the Forget button manually each time they want to wipe the history. 

This means that all cookies, history, tabs and windows are permanently deleted.
