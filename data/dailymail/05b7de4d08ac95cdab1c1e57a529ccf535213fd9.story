Most teenagers of the Eighties dreamed of zooming around on their own hoverboard like Marty McFly in the Back To The Future movies.

And now they can... over water, at least. While Marty seemingly zoomed around above the ground, the new gadget uses high-powered water jet to allow the rider to hover above the water.

It was invented by French jet-ski champion Franky Zapata, who also created the Flyboard in 2011, which also uses a water jetpack to propel users into the air.

McFlyin': A new water jet powered hoverboard is available for hire in the UK using a water jetpack to propel users into the air

Boys and their toys: The gadget can reach speeds of 16mph and allows riders to perform tricks including spins and somersaults

Splash the cash: If you want to take one home it well set you back £1,577 but thrillseekers can also hire one from Aquatic Jetpacks in Poole, Dorset

This latest product features a skateboard-shaped craft that will enable the rider to perform tricks, including somersaults and spins.

The device can get up to 16mph as it 'surfs' in mid-air.

While inspired by the classic film, Zapata has in fact beaten McFly to the punch by releasing the hoverboard this summer - one year before Marty and Doc rode them in the Back To The Future sequel in 2015.

The hoverboard is perfect for tricks, but is still not quite as versatile as Marty McFly's version of the board

Just like the movie! Marty McFly rides a hoverboard in the second Back To The Future movie, which shows America in the year 2015

The gadget costs $2,675 (£1,577) but thrillseekers can now hire one from Aquatic Jetpacks in Poole, Dorset.

Riders will need professional training to get to grips with the controls but owner Ross Ceaton said it was easier than it looks.

Ross, 31, said: 'Its awesome fun. It's like flying, but mixed with boarding sports.

'It's not too tricky, just a bit of balance and you're away.'
