Victor Garcia's European Championships came to an abrupt end on Tuesday in Zurich after the Spaniard clipped his knee on the final hurdle and fell heavily in the men's 3000m steeplechase heats.

Garcia, who was speeding around the outside in fifth place approaching the hurdle, had to be taken away from the Letzigrund stadium on a cart. 

Stumble: Garcia was in fifth place going into the final hurdle  in Zurich

Disaster: Garcia then suffered a nasty fall as his European Championships came to an end

The Spaniard would have qualified from the heats if he had finished fifth, but instead crashed out

Mateusz Demczyszak of Poland qualified with the win, alongside Martin Grau (Germany), Yuri Floriani (Italy), Tarik Langat (Turkey) and Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad (France). 

Garcia has history of falling at the final hurdle. In 2012, the 29-year-old was leading the 3000m steeplechase final at the European Championships in Helsinki in 2012, before falling and recovering to claim bronze. 

Dejected: Garcia lies injured on the floor as the other runners go over the line

Agony: Garcia is helped away by staff, with Poland's Mateusz Demczyszak winning the heat
