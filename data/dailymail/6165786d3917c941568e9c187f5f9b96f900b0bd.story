A married teacher who had an affair with a pupil told police and colleagues she was in love with the schoolboy, a court has heard.

Bernadette Smith engaged in ‘sexual activity’ with the ‘vulnerable’ 16-year-old, whom she had taught and also tutored after school.

The relationship started in Smith’s classroom at Bannockburn High School, Stirling, where she confessed her feelings to the boy, before the pair went to a nearby park and had their first kiss.

Court: Bernadette Smith, 35, told police she fell in love with the pupil she was having an affair with and planned to leave her husband to be with him

However, the teenager’s grandmother found out and told the school. Smith was then suspended on September 19.

But that night, the mother-of-three visited the boy's home and the pair spent the night together in bed.

Smith, 35, later told police that she had told her pupil’s father about her feelings for his son.

Wearing a maroon dress and black cardigan, the history and English teacher appeared in the dock at Stirling Sheriff Court yesterday.

Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, admitted a single charge that between September 13 and 20 this year, while in a position of trust, she engaged in sexual activity with the pupil, kissed him and lay beside him on a bed while partially clothed.

Depute fiscal Ann Orr told the court that the pupil was ‘regarded as vulnerable’.

She said that Smith had originally denied any physical contact had occurred when she was interviewed by headmaster Tom Black on September 19.

However, she confirmed that they had met twice outside school. But when Mr Black interviewed the boy, he confirmed the pair had kissed.

The police were informed and an investigation was launched.

Mrs Orr said that in a text message to a colleague, Smith said that she was going to leave her husband and had fallen in love with the pupil. The teacher added that they wanted to be together.

Mrs Orr added that Smith was detained by police after she arrived at the pupil’s house while they were interviewing him.

The fiscal said: ‘In the course of her interview with police, she confirmed she had known the boy since he began at the school.

‘She said she knew of the problems in his family life. She said he was a caring boy who found it difficult to trust people.

‘She admitted that she met him on two occasions outside school and kissed him on the mouth and on the neck.

‘She also admitted meeting at his home and told his father about her feelings, and she stayed overnight in the boy’s bedroom and that she had been wearing her jeans and a bra.’

Mrs Orr added: ‘She said during the interview that she loved the boy and they both wanted to be together.’

The fiscal said that during the teenager’s interview, his feelings for her ‘were somewhat less clear’.

Representing Smith, Andrew Gibb, solicitor for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union, asked for psychiatric reports to be carried out before sentencing.

He added: ‘She has lost her career. She can’t any longer remain as a registered teacher. Mrs Smith for some bizarre reason had feelings for him (the boy).

'She was the one who was responsible for this. He was in no way to blame.’

Deferring sentence for a social work report, Sheriff William Gilchrist told Smith: ‘Your bail will continue, which includes the special condition of no contact with the boy.’

At his home last night, the teenager said: ‘When it all happened I couldn’t believe it. I was shocked, it was weird and I didn’t expect it.

‘I don’t know how I would feel if I saw her again, or how I felt about her at the time. Now I just want to put it all behind me.

‘It has been strange at school since. People don’t really say things to me about it but a lot of them stare. I don’t know what to think. I feel sorry for her.’

His father said: ‘I couldn’t believe it was really happening. You don’t expect things like this to land on your doorstep.’
