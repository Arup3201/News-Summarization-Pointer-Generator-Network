A young man bullied so badly at school he developed anorexia has overcome his eating disorder to become a bodybuilder.

Perry Andrews, 24, from Cardiff, dropped out of school at age 16 as daily torments from bullies drove him to stop eating.

By the age of 15 he was in the grip of anorexia and although he was 5'11" tall, his weight had plummeted to a worrying seven stone.

He decided to beat his anorexia after seeing a bodybuilder on the cover of a health and fitness magazine. Over eight years he worked hard to achieve his dream figure (pictured) 

Mr Andrews now weighs 12st 6lb after a gruelling fitness regime involving training five times a week

He lifts 100kg deadweights, 100kg on the bench press and wears a weighted vest when doing bodyweight exercises

Then one day a fit and healthy model on the cover of a fitness magazine inspired him to beat his problem and become fit and healthy.

He joined a gym and started a training regime, eventually achieving a healthy weight he is happy with, of 12st 6lb. 

Over the next few years he built up his confidence as well as his muscles, asking a girl out for the first time in his life, and ending up in a happy relationship.

This year, he hopes to compete in the Body Power Expo's 'Physique of the Week' competition, and says that 'anything is possible' with willpower and discipline.

Mr Andrews, who works as a customer services employee at BHS, said the difficult times he has faced have shaped his character today.

He told MailOnline: 'I feel amazing now.

'Life comes with bad days and good days and the bad days structure who you are.

'I'd say to my former self, never give up. Put your mind to it and do it.

'It's hard being in that position, but you will get over it.

'It's made me more understanding. I'd say to people in my previous position, it's sad, and it's not something to be ashamed of.'

He said he felt different to other children from a young age, but when he moved up to secondary school at age 11, he soon became bullied on a daily basis.

Breakfast: Two whole eggs, two egg whites, cooked in coconut oil with spinach

Porridge with chocolate protein shake from PhD Growth Factor Mass or PhD Synergy

Mid-morning: chicken, broccoli and sweet potato

12 o’clock (while training): PhD Growth Factor Mass or PhD Synergy shake

Lunch: Steak, broccoli and sweet potato

Dinner: Cod or tuna with green vegetables and wholegrain rice

Dessert: Cottage cheese with chocolate protein shake mixed in. This is sometimes put in the freezer so its like ice cream. 

Exercise: He currently trains five days a week, with Sunday as a rest day. 

He said: 'When I was in primary school, I was a typical "geek" with glasses, and was the first person to put my hand up for a question, or stay late at the end of the lesson.

'I was a target for them. They noticed I was that type of person.

'Then I went up to higher school and it all fell apart there.

'I got bullied mentally and physically. They shouted things at me, flipped pen lids, threw paper, put things on my chair.'

The bullying affected his social life and his grades at school.

He said: 'It went on, I didn't tell anyone, I didn't know what to do, I was afraid.

'I missed out on everything. I didn't socialise as much. It became a huge part of my life.

'I had a few friends, but they were in the same position with the bullies. We had to learn to stand on our own two feet.

'My grades were affected.'

Slowly, he began to deny himself food, and though at 15 he was a tall 5'11", he eventually weighed just seven stone.

He said: 'I was a healthy kid, quite chubby, but that all started to change over the years.

'I was not eating at all. When my mum wasn't looking I'd throw food in the bin.

'They did ask me if I was OK in school but I kept denying it.'

This weight put his BMI at 13 - way below the healthy range of 18.5 to 25.

At this level, doctors warn being so underweight can cause stunted growth, weakened muscles and lack of energy.

Mr Andrews said he was tired all the time, had little motivation to do anything, and suffered terrible insomnia.

'It was overpowering, I was at my lowest point. I knew I had to change or face the consequences.'

Feeling ashamed of being bullied, Mr Andrews hid both the bullying and his anorexia from his mother and brother 

Mr Andrews now eats a diet of lean meats, green vegetables, sweet potatoes and PhD Nutrition protein shakes in order to maintain his muscular physique

As a teenager, Mr Andrews said the bullying meant he rarely socialised and never had a girlfriend during school

 Mr Andrews stopped eating by the age of 15, throwing food in the bin when his mother wasn't looking. By the age of 17 (pictured), he had begun to put weight back on after reintroducing biscuits at first

After coping with the bullying and an eating disorder became too much, he dropped out of school midway through his A-levels and took a part time job.

One day he went along to Warwickshire with his brother, who was doing work experience there, and picked up a health and fitness magazine.

Seeing the cover star, with a fit and healthy body, he was inspired to get his life back on track.

He said: 'I decided things were going to have to change.

'I looked in the mirror and thought "that's how I wanted to be".

He started to introduce foods slowly, until he could eat whole meals again. 

He said: 'It started off with a rich tea biscuit and then I'd start eating more things like Twix bars; bit of sugar to keep my energy going.

'It went on from there.' 

His brother was a member of a local gym, so he joined and researched diet and nutrition plans on the internet.

Having never had a girlfriend, last year he built up the confidence to ask a girl out for the first time

Within a year, he had put on two stone, achieving a much more healthy weight.

In the years since, he has gone on to train five days a week and now eats a diet of lean meats, sweet potato, green vegetables and  protein shakes from the brand PhD nutrition.

Bodybuilding gave him so much confidence he was also able to ask someone out for the first time in his life, having never had a girlfriend because being bullied had left him with low self-esteem.

He said: 'To be honest I didn't have a girlfriend until a year and a half ago.' 

'We met in work, we'd been working together for a while.

'We clicked on that level. I asked her out and she said yes. I couldn't believe it.

'She's behind me 100 per cent, she helps motivate me on a down day, reminding me where I've been and where I'm going to.

'Now I have more confidence in myself. I'm a happier, better soul.'

A regime of lifting 180kg deadweights, 100kg on the bench press and wearing a weighted vest when doing bodyweight exercises has now put his weight at a muscly 12st 6.

Proud of his hard work, he is determined to win the Body power Expo's 'Physique of the week' competition he has entered, which was the competition that inspired him to change his life.

'I'm in the mindset that I've already won' he said.

'When I think back to before, all those problems have disappeared. I feel amazing.'
