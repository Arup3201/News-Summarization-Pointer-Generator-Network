Final bid: Cleric Abu Hamza has made yet another plea to the High Court to stay in Britain but it is likely to fail

Hate preacher Abu Hamza was accused of ‘playing the system’ last night after his  lawyers launched another legal bid to block his extradition.

The hook-handed cleric’s legal team got a court ruling preventing him from being sent to the US while the latest application is dealt with.

It is thought they will argue his physical and mental health has deteriorated so much that he is not fit to stand trial on terror charges.

Whitehall sources said Hamza’s legal team – who have already earned more than half a million pounds in legal aid from representing him – were ‘playing the system’.

A source added: ‘We’re still confident he’ll be out of the country soon.’

Home Office officials have predicted it will take two to three weeks to arrange Hamza’s removal from the country and into the custody of US marshals.

Hamza was told on Monday that his appeal to the European Court of Human Rights had failed.

He had claimed that a potential jail term of up to 50 years without parole would breach his human right to be protected from ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’.

In April the ECHR rejected that claim, but he was given a further right of appeal.

He asked the court’s highest body, the Grand Chamber, to reconsider, but that was rejected on Monday night.

He took his case to Strasbourg 
following years of delays caused by countless legal challenges in this 
country – all of which failed.

The basis of cleric Abu Hamza's latest appeal to the High Court has not yet been revealed, with the Judicial Service only confirming the preacher and one other terror suspect are 'seeking injunctions preventing their removal from the UK'.

Hamza's application has stopped the extradition process - but only very briefly - as his request for an injunction will be considered on Tuesday.

If he loses, the Government's target of getting him on a plane to the United States within two weeks will still be on track.

If he wins, then the legal process will begin again, with the Home Office sure to appeal the decision.

Whatever Hamza's taxpayer-funded legal team argues next week, they have to prove to the judge that there has been a 'new and compelling' change in the cleric's argument to stay, which crucially has not been considered in the eight years of cases that have cost the taxpayer millions and clogged up the courts since his conviction for soliciting murder and racial hatred in Britain.

Legal experts have suggested his latest act will be futile, and he is 'playing the system' and 'very unlikely' to prevent his extradition to America.

The High Court said the case for his removal was ‘unassailable’.

The US authorities want to put Hamza 
on trial for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in  Oregon.

He is
also accused of taking part in a kidnapping plot in the Yemen.

His notoriety in this country comes from his fanatical sermons delivered outside the Finsbury Park mosque in North London.

He is credited with turning dozens of young men to his radical and hate-filled ideology.

Since 2004, he has been held in the 
high-security unit at Belmarsh prison – the so-called ‘prison within a 
prison’ – at a cost to taxpayers of about £50,000 a year.

A hearing on whether the extradition 
should be blocked will be held next Tuesday, before Sir  John Thomas, 
President of the Queen’s Bench Division, and Mr Justice Ouseley.

A second terror suspect, Khaled 
Al-Fawwaz, whose case was dealt with in Strasbourg at the same time as 
Hamza’s, has also launched an appeal.

Al-Fawwaz is wanted for his alleged 
involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam 
in 1998.

He faces more than 269 counts of murder.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The European Court of Human Rights ruled there was no bar to the extradition of these men.’
