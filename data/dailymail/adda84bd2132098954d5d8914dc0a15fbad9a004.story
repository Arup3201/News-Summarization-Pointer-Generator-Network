If the chilly winter weather is getting you down, there's nothing like a little summer dreaming to brighten up the dark damp days.

Gazing at this collection of the world's most extraordinary pools, put together by Home Life, may help to warm you up and give some inspiration to start planning summer holidays abroad.

Bondi's Icebergs pool is the only Australian location to appear in the list, while Chile's San Alfonso Del Mar is the largest pool in the world capable of holding 250 million litres of water.

The luxurious lengthy pool located atop the Marine Bay Sands in Singapore is in the heart of the CBD and looks over the city skyline, while the pool at Phoenix Seagaia Resort in Japan is a makeshift beach with artificial waves and sand.

At the Holiday Inn in Shanghai the more daring divers can plunge into a glass-bottomed pool that overhangs the 24th floor of the resort, and in Greece The Perivolas Resort brags a private swimming pool carved into the rock face of the island.

From India and Jordan to Thailand and Bali, these gems - some secluded and some not so secret - are dotted across resorts and holiday locations across the globe.
