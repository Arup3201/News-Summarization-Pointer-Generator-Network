They didn't need to be asked twice.

Firefighters in eastern China jumped at the chance when they were asked to put 300 mini-skirted girls from a hostess bar through their paces.

The waitresses arrived at the fire station in Wenling, Zhejiang province, wearing stiletto heels and plenty of make-up.

Training: Firefighters in eastern China jumped at the chance when they were asked to put 300 mini-skirted girls from a hostess bar through their paces

Dressing up: The waitresses arrived at the fire station in Wenling, Zhejiang province, wearing stiletto heels and plenty of make-up

They were there for a fire safety course and were soon being instructed in how to properly use a fire extinguisher.

All
the girls - with their off-the-shoulder tops and stiletto heels - are 
assistants at a local KTV bar, a cross between a karaoke bar and a 
hostess club.

A fire 
service spokesman said: 'It is a public building and the staff have to 
go through fire safety courses to get a public entertainment licence.'

But he played down any suggestion that the firemen in any way enjoyed their day's work.

He
said: 'The girls were wearing mini-skirts and high heels because that's
what they wear at work. It was all the same to our men.'

What gentlemen: They were there for a fire safety course and were soon being instructed in how to properly use a fire extinguisher

Drill: The hostesses take part in a mock fire alarm, covering their mouths and noses with handkerchiefs so they do not inhale smoke

Pay attention: The women listen intently as the intricate details of fire safety are spelled out to them
