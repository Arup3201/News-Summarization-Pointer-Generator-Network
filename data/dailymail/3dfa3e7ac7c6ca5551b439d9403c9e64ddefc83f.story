A woman accidentally shot herself in the head with a gun bought for protection from violent protests in Ferguson, reports claim.

The 26-year-old, named in a police report as Becca Campbell, was holding the gun in her boyfriend's car when he unintentionally rear-ended another vehicle, a police report said.

It caused the gun to go off, hitting Miss Campbell, who died hours later in hospital.

Her 33-year-old partner, who was unidentified in the report read by CNN, allegedly told police they bought the firearm as they feared mass violence after the grand jury announces its verdict on the Michael Brown shooting.

Seven men and five women have been deliberating whether to indict white officer Darren Wilson for three months.

With the verdict anticipated for Monday morning, law enforcement has issued police with grenades, erected barricades around the justice center, and enlisted almost 100 FBI officers to line the streets.

According to Miss Campbell's boyfriend, the victim had been waving the gun around, joking that she was 'ready for Ferguson', CNN reported.

Ducking his head to get out of the firing line, the man claims he accidentally swerved and hit the car in front.

The police investigation into the incident is ongoing.

The incident comes amid fraught tension in Ferguson surrounding the Michael Brown grand jury hearing. 

Despite calls for calm from Michael Brown's mother and President Barack Obama, attorney Benjamin Crump has revealed the family does not trust the procedure, which could see Officer Wilson avoid trial.

'The process is completely unfair,' Crump told ABC News.

He added: 'I have no doubt if they were to indict the police officer, he would be guaranteed his full constitutional rights of innocent until proven guilty.

'He would get every benefit of the doubt.

'I don't worry about the due process for officer Wilson. I worry about the due process for the little black boy dead on the ground.'

His words come as authorities in Ferguson erect barricades around Buzz Westfall Justice Center, where the jury is expected to announce its verdict on Monday morning.

St Louis County prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch called for a jury - made up of nine white and three black people to reflect the racial make up of the county - to decide whether Officer Wilson should be charged.

Following evidence from Officer Wilson, forensic pathologists and witnesses, the panel will have to decide whether Wilson intentionally violated Brown's civil rights by fatally shooting him.

Crump said: 'I just think this is process is unlike anything I've ever seen in my 20 years of practice. We don't think it's fair.

'If this prosecutor says ... we're not going to recommend any charges, that's different from anything he's done in his past 28 years with grand juries.'

He added: 'Why can't it be equal justice? Why can't we have the same process?'

Last month, legal experts told MailOnline the charge is more complex and difficult to prove than a murder or manslaughter charge.

Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, told MailOnline the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. 

'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse.

'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder.

'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.'

As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty.

Duke University law professor James Coleman Jr told MailOnline an innocent verdict would 'totally undermine the St Louis criminal justice system'.

'If a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self-defense that simply is not plausible,' he said.

Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden has urged protesters to refrain from violence, and President Obama has called for calm.

Obama added that he has not ruled out a trip to Ferguson following the announcement of the jury's verdict.
