Foria claims to be the first sexual lubricant designed specifically to improve sex for women

A marijuana-based spray which claims to be the first sexual lubricant designed specifically to improve sex for women goes on sale in Colorado next week.

Foria contains marijuana extract and the makers claim the relaxing properties of cannabis can help women have better and more satisfying sex.

An edible coconut oil-based spray, users are advised to spritz Floria on their genitals about 30 minutes before sex to 'create the relaxation needed for sensual experience' and possibly multiple orgasms.

Aphrodite Group – the California-based medical marijuana collective that sells the potion – said the majority of women who use it won't get high, but will  feel more relaxed.

The product was launched several months ago in California, but will go on sale  in Colorado next week at an Aspen marijuana boutique just in time for the X Games, which begin on January 22.

'We definitely have patients coming in for it, requesting it specifically. ... A-list celebrities that come in specifically for it. You'd be surprised who comes in for it,' Matthew Rosen of the CannaSutra co-op in Studio City, California told USA Today. 'Most people have been giving positive feedback on it.'

A video on the company's website features women speaking openly about how they use it and its effects.

The formula was inspired by the historical use of cannabis as an aphrodisiac in traditional cultures around the world.

'For some women, it may awaken arousal and heighten sensation making orgasms more intense, fuller, or easier to access,' Foria's makers claim.

'For others, it can help promote natural lubrication, reduce pain and tension and create the relaxation necessary for sensual experience, or restorative rest.'

The mixture is not designed to be used like a standard lubricant, but is designed to be applied at least half an hour before sex.

This time allows for the active compounds of the drug to be fully activated and absorbed, the collective said.

While men can also use it, the lubricant is intended for women because the membrane of the vagina is more sensitive and absorbent.

'Introducing medicines, compounds and different drugs through the vagina is something that both modern doctors and doctors throughout history have done,' Matthew Gerson, creator of Foria told Nerve.

'Women report a sense of embodiment, a sense of dropping into a more full relationship to sexual sensations and sensations around the body.

'As you can imagine, as that builds up to orgasm - if orgasm is a part of your experience - then that can lead to intensification and a more full body experience,' he continued.

Some women who have used the product reported tingling as well as increased warmth and relaxation. Others had multiple orgasms, but some found the lubricant helped them fall asleep.

The potion costs $44 for 10ml or $88 for 30ml, but it is currently only available to residents of California who have a letter from their doctor, or a medical marijuana card.
