A pair of owls are believed to have become the oldest parents in the world after hatching a chick despite a combined age of 372.

The two love birds, Gerben and Fleur, are 33 and 29 respectively – an impressive 198 and 174 in human years.

The Tawny Frogmouths surprised keepers at a wildlife park by recently hatching Willow, nine weeks.

The couple, who live at Paultons Park near Romsey, Hampshire, are believed to be the oldest Tawny Frogmouths  in the world.

Tawny Frogmouths are an Australian cousin to the owl, but are only expected to live to up to 14 years in the wild.

Jamie Summers, assistant livestock manager at the park, said: ‘We have done lots of research and we cannot find a Tawny Frogmouth  in captivity that is older than 30.

‘We wouldn't normally calculate their ages in human years like you might do with a dog, but if you were to base it on calculations then Gerben could be almost 200 years old.

‘He has had seven or eight babies in his lifetime and although he is old he is still acting as if he was a teenager.

‘Some birds don't act any different as they get older and will carry on breeding and behaving in their natural way, however some species stop as they age.

‘He does get a bit grumpy sometimes because Fleur makes him sit on the eggs, which take between 25 and 30 days to hatch.

‘He is well past what he should have reached in age but he is still very healthy apart from a slightly broken beak.’

The Tawny Frogmouth can grow up to 21 inches long and weigh up to 1.5lbs.

Owls eat small mammals whereas Tawny Frogmouths  prey on smaller creatures such as insects and rarely hunt, instead they will wait for food to come to them.
