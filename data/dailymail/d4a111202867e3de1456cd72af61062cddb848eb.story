The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year, which marks the transition to longer daylight hours - but for some - it holds more importance than simply seeing more sunshine.

For the 20 people living on the Davis Station in Antarctica, mid-winters day is the halfway point of their stay on the continent, and they celebrate in a very unique way.

Outside temperatures average around an unimaginably cold -30 degrees at this time of the year, so what better time than to take a dip in balmy 1.8 degree water?

Jump in, the water's lovely! Staff at the Davis Station in Antarctica celebrate the winter solstice by plunging into a freezing sea 'pool'

Hard work: It took a whole day to saw through one metre thick ice when creating the pool

Celebration: In the early morning of the mid-winters day it's tradition for members at the station to take a dip

In a video released by the Australian Antarctic Division, station manager Narelle Campbell gives a fascinating insight into what life is like in one of the coldest places on earth.

Each year, to celebrate the equinox and the middle of their expedition, but also to honor those who have been down before them, members of the Davis Station dive into icy waters.

It takes the whole day prior to prepare the 'pool' as 'the sea ice here at the moment is one metre deep, so it did take a while for them to get those chunks of ice out,' Ms Campbell says.

Appropriate clothing: One of the staff can be seen preparing to jump into the 1.8 degree water in just his yellow board shorts and shoes

Warming up: The sea water is substantially warmer than the -32 degree air temperature

Then, on the morning of the solstice staff take the plunge, stripping off in sub-zero temperatures to immerse themselves in comparatively warmer waters.

Following this, they enjoy a more pleasant experience in an outdoor spa created especially for the celebrations.

A formal dinner 'toasting all those who have been down before it, and family and friends back home who we haven't seen for quite some time' concludes the evening.

Making light of the fact no one on the continent will see a ship, or any vessel for that matter, until November, Ms Campbell takes a dig at her loved ones for not making the trip to join them for the event.

'We did send an invitation out to many people to attend our party tonight, lot's of excuses why they can't get here...probably because it's impossible.'

The winter months in world's southern most continent are extremely cold and dark, and the 20 individuals who are currently working at the station will return home at the end of this year.

From mid-July onwards the days will get longer in Antarctica, 'which we're all looking forward to, even though it will only just pop its head up briefly...until it hangs around a bit longer as the year goes on,' Ms Campbell says.

Living quarters: Away from friends and family for a long time, this team will head home at the end of the year

Down time: The quarters feature a pool table and other activities

Going solo: Not a single ship nor vessel will be able to reach Antarctica until November
