A riverside cottage overlooking the pretty crossing that is said to have inspired the song 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' is up for auction.

According to local legend, Simon and Garfunkel penned their classic hit in 1969 after enjoying the breathtaking views from Bickleigh Bridge in Tiverton, Devon.

The pretty grey stone bridge of five arches over the River Exe, which was built in 1809, is overlooked by Bickleigh Cottage, which has gardens that extend right up to the bridge.

The grade two listed thatched property will go under the hammer in June as either one or two lots after its owners for the past 80 years decided to sell up.

It was built in the 17th century and extended in 1973 and has been a hotel since 2000 when it was turned into three dwellings.

Lot one includes the five-bedroom main house and two-bedroom annexe, riverside gardens, orchard, double garage and 120 yards of single bank fishing rights.

The second lot includes a smaller, adjacent property called the ‘Kingfisher Cottage’.

'One of the quirks is that the ground floor is prone to occasional flooding. Occupants are given plenty of notice of imminent high water thanks to an automatic notification from the Environment Agency.

'The ground floor of the house is designed accordingly with stone flagged floors and raised electrical sockets.

'On the opposite bank to Bickleigh Cottage is an area of about 1.2 acres of young mixed woodland.
