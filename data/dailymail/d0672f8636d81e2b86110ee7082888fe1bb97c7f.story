A retired footballer has been ordered to pay a woman more than £2,500 in damages - after she stubbed her toe on a 'keep off the grass' sign outside his house.

Former goalkeeper Malcolm White, 73, has also been hit with a £25,000 legal bill after he was successfully sued by Emma Grady.

Miss Grady, 40, injured her left toe on a homemade wooden sign the pensioner had put on a grass verge outside his home in South Hykeham, Lincolnshire.

Emma Jane Grady made a claim against Malcolm White, after she said that she had tripped over a 'Do not park on the grass' sign that he had placed there. The signs can be seen here placed in the grass, circled in red, but they have since been removed

The sign, which measured 4ins by 10in, read ‘Please do not park on the grass’ and was erected outside hisdetached property.

Mr White, who played for Lincoln City, Grimbsy Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers, put it there as a favour for villagers who were fed up with parents parking on the grass verge when they collected their children from the local primary school.

But he was taken to court after Miss Grady tore the nail off her left big toe on a rusty nail when she stumbled over the sign as she went to collect her daughter from school on November 12, 2012.

Miss Grady, who lives half-a-mile away in the neighbouring village of High Hykeham, claimed it took six months for her toe nail to grow back but has been left deformed.

Mr White, who went on to play in America for Los Angeles Wolves, has been ordered to pay Miss Grady £2,541.35 in damages and £24,874.39 in court costs.

He denied erecting the sign but his wife Valerie, 72, admitted he did put it up in a telephone conversation with Miss Grady’s solicitor Katherine Trafford.

Passing judgement at Lincoln County Court, District Judge Chris Cooper said: 'This case comes down to whether or not Mr and Mrs White or Mrs Trafford is telling the truth.

'It is clear that the claimant suffered sizable injury after the accident.

'I am satisfied that it happened in the way that she said it did and she stubbed her toe on the offending sign.

'I am also satisfied that the signs caused a public nuisance.

'A pedestrian does not have to look at their feet when going about their business.'

Mr White has now been forced to pay the cash from his own pocket because his insurance company will not cover his legal bills.

In a statement after the hearing, the couple's solicitor Patrick Tedstone said: 'It’s a sad day for Mal and Val.

'They are leaving the village this week after more than 30 very, very happy years, to be closer to family.

'They are very disappointed with the judgement and with the costs, too, but they will respect the judge’s decision.

Malcolm White played youth football for his hometown team Wolverhampton Wanderers before signing for Grimsby Town in the late 1950s.

He enjoyed a successful trial with the club and stayed with the club for five years making nearly 70 first-team appearances from 1958 to 1963.

He went on to play for Walsall, Lincoln City, Bradford City and Halifax Town before going to America to star for Los Angeles Wolves in the late 1960s.

Speaking in 2011, he told how, playing for Grimsby, he once saved a penalty from the legendary Brian Clough - who went on to win two consecutive European Cups as manager of Nottingham Forrest.

He said: 'When we were in the Second Division, we were competing with the likes of Sunderland, Newcastle, Chelsea, Leeds and Middlesbrough.

'Against Sunderland, I saved a penalty from Brian Clough in front of 46,000 - mind you, he scored a hat-trick in the same game.'

'They wish everyone in the village well.'

A friend added: 'They are gutted. It’s a barmy ruling because the sign was put on the verge to stop parents churning it up with their cars.

'The land is publicly owned but was being turned into a car park by inconsiderate parents. I feel very sorry for them. This should never have gone to court.'

Miss Grady said: 'I am relieved this is all over.

'I have been through 18 months of hell. My foot will never be the same again. I am satisfied with the result.'
