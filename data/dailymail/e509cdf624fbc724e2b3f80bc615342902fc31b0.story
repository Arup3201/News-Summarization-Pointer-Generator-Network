The secret to happiness is helping others - and setting yourself concrete goals to do so, say researchers.

They claims that achieving goals give us a far greater sense of satisfaction that abstract concepts of helping others.

The team even admit that chasing happiness without clearly defined goals could make us unhappy, resulting in 'helper burnout'.

Researchers say the key to being happy is you set goals you can achieve, rather than rely on abstract concepts

One experiment the team carried out involved bone marrow transplants focused on the whether giving those who need bone marrow transplants 'greater hope' – the abstract goal – or giving those who need bone marrow transplants a 'better chance of finding a donor' – the concrete goal – made a giver more happy.

The answer was that helping someone find a donor resulted in more happiness for the giver.

This, the researchers wrote, was driven by givers' perceptions that their actual acts better met their expectations of accomplishing their goal of helping another person.

Givers are likely to experience greater happiness if they frame acts of benevolence in concrete rather than abstract terms, according to the new study.

'Although the desire for personal happiness may be clear, the path to achieving it is indefinite,' said Jennifer Aaker at Stanford University, who led the research.

'One reason for this hazy route to happiness is that although people often think they know what leads to happiness, their predictions about what will make them happy are often inaccurate.'

The team say one path to happiness is through concrete, specific goals of benevolence – like making someone smile or increasing recycling – instead of following similar but more abstract goals – like making someone happy or saving the environment.

The reason is that when you pursue concretely framed goals, your expectations of success are more likely to be met in reality.

On the other hand, broad and abstract goals may bring about happiness' dark side – unrealistic expectations.

'Discrepancies between aspirations and reality can be critical factors that, in extreme cases, may even lead the act of helping to eventually becoming a source of unhappiness,' said Melanie Rudd, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Houston, who also worked on the research.

For example, when people pursue abstract prosocial goals and expect their relentless giving to result in tremendous and rapid change for the better and it fails to materialize they can suffer from 'helper burnout,' which can negatively impact happiness.

Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS Shoes The firm promises that if a customer buys a pair of shoes, they will deliver another pair to a child in need.

The results also have implications for the world of business, the team say.

For instance, marketing or products that claim to help consumers achieve abstractly framed goals – like making someone else happy – might not be the best business decision.

Instead, it might be wiser to reframe these promised goals in more specific, concrete terms - such as Tom's Shoes, which promises that if a customer buys a pair of shoes, they will deliver another pair to a child in need.

'Concrete initiatives such as this may be a more realistic way to accurately set consumers' expectations from the outset and leave them happier in the end,' Aaker said.

Ultimately, people seek to be happy, and one clear path toward happiness is through prosocial behaviors.

Aaker explained, 'A prosocial act can not only boost the happiness of the recipient, but it can boost the happiness of the giver as well.'
