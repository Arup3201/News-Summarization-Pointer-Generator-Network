Until this week, Gary Jones had never been to watch his daughter compete in taekwondo.The prospect of seeing his eldest child, Jade, 19, get kicked in the head for trophies was ‘too scary’ to see.

But on Thursday a very proud – and sometimes still scared – Mr Jones was feet away when she realised her Olympic dream.

In a tight final, the petite blonde from Flint, a small town in North Wales, beat the Chinese two-time world champion to become Britain’s first taekwondo gold medallist and the youngest Team GB gold medal winner of the Games so far.

‘My head is still in the clouds,’ said Mr Jones, a 40-year-old fisherman and cockle picker. ‘Proud is not the word, to see your daughter competing and win a gold medal in the Olympics, it’s unbelievable. I’m so happy for her.

‘To see Jade on that medal rostrum, I had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. I still can’t believe she pulled it off.’

Mr Jones, a father of three, admitted he had hated watching at times during her winning bout at the ExCeL arena.

‘Until now I couldn’t bear to watch her fight,’ said. ‘But she made me go and see her this time, I obviously couldn’t miss her at the Olympics.

‘At times I couldn’t look and wanted to run off, it’s scary watching your daughter getting kicked. But I watched every round, I screamed and shouted as loud as I could with the crowd, it was very tense.’

Referring to the next Olympics, in Brazil in 2016, he added: ‘I’m going to have to pick a fair few cockles to try and get myself to Rio now that I’ve broken my duck of going to watch her compete.‘She’s the best in the world now, so hopefully nobody will be knocking her out for the foreseeable future.’

MrJones had made the trip to London with Jade’s mother, Jayne Ferguson, 40, and grandfather, Martin Foulkes.

Mr Foulkes, 57 – her mother’s stepfather – introduced Jade to the sport at the age of eight to keep her ‘off the streets’.

Although they split when Jade was just nine, her parents, who live less than a quarter of a mile apart in Flint, remain on good terms and she is close to both of them.

Jade, raised in a council block with her 13-year-old brother Luke, was a pupil at Gwynedd Primary School when she got hooked on the Korean martial art.

And, as our exclusive pictures show, Jade’s talent soon began to shine. She won student of the year at her club several times and filled the trophy cabinet at her grandparents’ house with awards, including national titles.

To pursue her dream of a gold medal, at 15 she switched from International Taekwondo Federation rules to the World Taekwondo Federation code, used in the Olympics.

By that point she had outgrown her local club, so her grandfather, who works as an engineer in a factory, devoted much of his spare time to driving her the 60 miles to train at the Manchester Aces Club, four times a week after school.

‘It’s been hard, Jade’s not come from a wealthy background,’ her father said. ‘Her grandfather has done an immense amount for her, taking her to training, covering her expenses, and we’ve given her what we can along the way.’

She did well academically, passing nine GCSEs ‘with flying colours,’ but left Flint High School at 16 to take up the sport full-time.

Her former headmistress Pam McClean was among the crowd to watch her fight on Thursday. She said: ‘We all knew she was good, but we hadn’t realised just how fantastically good she was.’

Jade, nicknamed ‘The Headhunter’ because of her liking for kicking opponents in the head, said she barely slept after her win.

‘I only had one hour’s sleep, I was just lying in bed awake,’ she said. ‘It was an unbelievable day, I always went there with the aim of getting gold and I knew I could win, but I knew it was going to be hard.’

‘I just gave it my everything and ended up on top, so I’m just buzzing.’ Yesterday the streets of Flint were also ‘buzzing’ with Jade’s success.

The night before, more than 300 people had packed into the town’s sports and social club, standing on tables and cheering as they watched their girl bring home the gold.

Jade comes from a large extended family – her father has around 50 cousins – and almost all of the 12,000-strong Flint population seemed to be claiming some relation to her yesterday. Many can boast of having had a hand in her career, after they clubbed together to raise the £1,600 Jade needed to get to the 2010 Junior Olympic qualifiers in Singapore – where she won gold.

Houses, pubs, businesses and shops were decked in Union Jack bunting and Jade’s face beamed from posters in their windows.

And the butchers, where Jade’s mother works as a sales assistant, had an Olympic sausage on sale.
