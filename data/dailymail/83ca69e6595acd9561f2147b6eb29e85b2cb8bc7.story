A Texas woman recovering in hospital after being stabbed in her own home and giving birth to a baby girl has courageously spoken for the first time since her horrifying ordeal.

Rachel Poole, 31, gave birth to a daughter named Isabella at University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas by caesarean section.

Poole has been in hospital since Wednesday evening when she was brutally attacked by Corey Bernard, 19, while she was in her kitchen speaking to her husband Justin Pele Poole - who was deployed overseas but has since returned - via FaceTime.

Bravely speaking with KFOX14 via phone from her hospital bed, Poole assured well-wishers both her and her daughter are going to be alright.

'I think the recovery is going pretty well, we have an amazingly strong daughter who is absolutely gorgeous,' Rachel said.

'It means the world, just being able to see her and know that, through everything, she's doing just fine.'

'Pillar of strength': New mother Rachel Poole cannot see out of one eye, has a collapsed lung, a displaced vertebrae and is unable to hold her newborn baby, but has bravely chosen to give her first interview to assure well-wishers she is recovering. Her husband describes her as a 'pillar of strength'

Bittersweet: Justin Poole cradles his new baby girl, whose mother Rachel Poole is still in a serious condition after enduring a vicious attack in her own home. He has rightly described his wife as a 'pillar of strength'

Isabella Poole was delivered by early C-Section following the horrific stabbing of her mother, Rachel Poole. Isabella was born ill due to the strong medications that needed to be given to Rachel, but is making a good recovery

Happier times: A photo of Rachel and Justin Poole before the attack that will change their lives forever. Corey Bernard Moss, a 19-year-old Fort Bliss soldier, went to the home of 31-year-old Rachel in the 9400 block of Wichita Circle to confront her about money he owed. Poole wasn't home, so Moss allegedly broke in and hid inside the home until she returned. When Poole came home she began FaceTiming on the phone with her husband, who was stationed in Asia. Moss then attacked her from behind with a knife, beating her as well

Baby Isabella was born quite sick due to the strong doses of medication her mother had been given to stay alive.

However she has since recovered and will soon be taken out of the NICU and moved in with the other babies.

Sadly Rachel hasn't been able to see her daughter.

'I haven't personally gotten to see her yet, until I make my recovery I'm not going to be able to, but all the reports I have on her are really good,' she said.

Rachel is said to have been blinded in one eye after being stabbed in the head.

'I still haven't talked to the eye doctor, I really want to wait for any confirmation, we're very hopeful,' she said.

Justin has been reading her messages of support, which have been flooding in from the public.

'Honestly it's such an encouragement, just to see and hear the support that is being brought to my family right now, through everything, knowing that everyone's really come to stand behind us right now is really helpful for any kind of recovery,' she said.

Ambush: El Paso police say Moss went to the Pooles' home in the 9400 block of Wichita Circle, broken in and waited for Rachel to come home

The 31-year-old mother-to-be was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition and treated for stab wounds to her face and body and multiple fractures.

Poole's stepfather, Gary Jones said that doctors couldn't 'do anything with [her] injuries unless they got Isabella out.'

He
also said that Rachel Poole may need an eye socket reconstruction, that she 
suffered a collapsed lung and that one of her verebrae is out of place 
after the attack.

Poole was talking to her husband on FaceTime 
Wednesday night when a man identified as 19-year-old Corey Moss broke 
into their El Paso home and lunged at her with a knife.

According to an arrest affidavit obtained by KFOX14, she recognized her assailant as a man who owed her husband money and screamed out his name.

According to police, the wounded victim was able to call 911 and give the name of the suspect to police.

Meanwhile, Justin Poole called the 19-year-old's co-workers, who helped apprehend Moss and seized the knife allegedly used in the attack.

Following his arrest, police said Moss admitted to stabbing Rachel Poole

The teenager has been charged with criminal attempted capital murder and was held on $60,000 bond.

The bond has since been increased to $150,000.

Suspect: Cory Bernard Moss, 19, allegedly admitted to the knife attack, which was reportedly sparked by a money dispute

Neighbors
told KFOX14 that Moss owed the Pooles' money for car repairs 
because he had borrowed a vehicle from them and wrecked it.

According
to El Paso police, Moss, a soldier attached to Fort Bliss, went to the 
Pooles' home in the 9400 block of Wichita Circle to talk to Rachel Poole
about the money he owed her husband.

The woman wasn't home, so the 19-year-old allegedly forced his way into the house and lay in ambush, waiting for her to return.

When
Poole came home, she opened the Apple video chat program FaceTime on 
her phone and began talking to her husband, who was stationed in 
southwest Asia.

A short time later, police say Moss 
came out of hiding and surprised Rachel Poole from behind, repeatedly 
stabbing her with a foldout stainless steel knife and beating her.

According
to the affidavit, the victim instantly recognized Moss as her husband's
debtor and yelled out his name several times so Justin Poole could hear
it over the phone.

Following the attack, police say Moss fled and called a co-worker to pick him up and drive him to Fort Bliss.

Meanwhile, Justin Poole called Moss' colleagues to alert them of the suspect’s imminent return to the military base.

The 19-year-old's co-workers intercepted him and found the knife in the car where he was riding.

Fort Bliss spokesman Joe Buccino said that Army Pvt Poole has been deployed in southwest Asia for the past nine months, HLN-TV reported.

Justin Poole returned home to be with his wife, who he describes as a 'pillar of strength'.

He said the family will not be silent about their ordeal.

'Once my wife is out of the hospital, let the nation know she will speak up,' he said.

'She wants to be more than a number. 

'I see her as a pillar of strength for her struggle to save not only her life, but my daughter's as well.'

‘My wife is my wife til I'm no longer breathing,’ the serviceman wrote earlier in the week on Facebook.

‘No man can change that and though I was not here to protect her this time it will never happen again that's my word.’

Today he introduced the couple's daughter to Facebook friends.

'In case you are wondering Rachel Poole is fighting to beat this but here is why she is fighting so hard. We love you baby,' he wrote.

Tragically, he added that the couple's dog had died after being left alone in the house following the attack on Rachel Poole.
