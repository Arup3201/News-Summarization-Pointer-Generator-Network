A pensioner sentenced to 25 years jail for killing his wife battered his new lover to death just weeks after being released - so he could go back and enjoy 'three meals a day and a warm bed'.

Stanislaw Chmielewski, 64, told police he had struggled to survive after being released from prison in Gdansk, a city on Poland's Baltic coast.

Chmielewski then hatched a plan to return to jail and signed up with an online dating agency. He then used a hammer to beat to death the first girl they set him up with, a 25-year-old office worker.  

Police lead Stanislaw Chmielewski back to jail; the 64-year-old killed a woman he met through a dating agency, just weeks after being released over his wife's murder, so he could return to prison

Police spokesman Jurek Wysocki said the former inmate called authorities and said he had 'just murdered someone'.

When officers arrived they found the woman lying on the kitchen floor. 

Chmielewski was said to have confessed to the killing which he told police he had planned to commit. 

Mr Wysocki said: 'His reason, he said, was that he wanted to go back to jail because he had money problems and life was easier in jail than it was living on the outside.'

Chmielewski was said to have confessed to the killing and said that he had planned to do it as life was much easier in prison; the pensioner said he looked forward to returning to 'three meals a day and a warm bed'

He was then taken into custody.

When told he was likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, Chmielewski told officers, 'That suits me just fine'. 

He then added: 'Life out here is nastier and more dangerous than anything you can see in jail. I'm sorry for the girl, but I'm looking forward to three meals a day and a warm bed.'
