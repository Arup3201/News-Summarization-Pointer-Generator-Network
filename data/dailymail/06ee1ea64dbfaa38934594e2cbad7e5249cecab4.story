Luis Suarez's wife Sofia has revealed that the Barcelona star told her he didn't bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup in Brazil - before admitting the truth 10 days later.

The Uruguayan received a four-month ban for the incident and was condemned by world football but still completed a £75million move from Liverpool to the La Liga side.

His wife admits that Suarez didn't believe that he had done anything but the television replays suggested otherwise and he then owned up.

Sofia told Canal 10: 'He told me he hadn’t done it. That is what he had in his head and even I began to believe it. But the television and radio spoke only about the bite and after 10 days of us being alone he told me the truth.

'On the day of the game I phoned him and asked what he had done. He responded with ‘what?’ The same had happened in England and I insisted: ‘Again?’ He replied: ‘I haven’t done anything. Are you not happy because Uruguay qualified?'

Ever since his ban was uplifted, Suarez has shone for his new side alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, with the La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey treble still very much a possibility.
