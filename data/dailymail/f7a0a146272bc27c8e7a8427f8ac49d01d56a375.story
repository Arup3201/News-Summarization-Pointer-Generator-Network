Halloween is just around the corner and I’m mega excited to get dressed up! 

Fancy dress always makes getting ready for a night out more fun, and on Halloween you can really go crazy with your costumes.

I’ve decided on a scary yet sexy look this year, inspired by Natalie Portman in the film Black Swan. It features dramatic winged eyes and a deep vampy berry lip, and offers maximum impact with not too much effort!

So in case you’re deliberating over your October 31 ensemble, this week I thought I’d share with you how to get the look yourselves.

THE BASE

To create a spooky white base for the look, mix white face paint with a dollop of a light coverage foundation like bareMinerals BareSkin Pure Brightening Serum Foundation to make the look slightly less harsh.

Binky has used make-up rather than face paint in order to avoid looking too harsh 

Apply the mixture all over the face with a foundation brush or sponge like Real Techniques Flawless Miracle Complexion Sponge, and fix in place with a generous sweep of Vichy Dermablend Setting Powder.

Next, contour your cheekbones with a strong dark colour for a dramatic sculpted look – I used DiorShow Fusion Mono Matte Eyeshadow in Mirage, brushing the colour heavily just under my cheekbones to create the illusion of a super-structured visage.

THE EYES

Start by using a liquid eyeliner with a precise nib like DHC Liquid Eyeliner to create the outline of the haunting dark eyes. Begin from the temple and take the line all around your eyes, ending with a point towards your nose. Feel free to make the outline as big and bold as you like – if you can’t go all out on Halloween, when can you?

Binky says that Halloween is the one opportunity to go as bold as you like with makeup 

Once you’ve successfully outlined the shape, use the DHC eyeliner to add further lines and patterns into the eye socket to create the swan-wing effect. To fill the eyes in use a highly pigmented black shadow like the dark shade in the Dior 5 Couleurs Palette in Pied-de-Poule. To embellish the eyes further, fill in some sections with the deep navy and green shades from the palette.

Follow up with lashings of Guerlain Maxi Lash Mascara to give your peepers a sexily spooky flutter.

THE LIPS

Finally, for a vampy Portman-style pout, apply a deep berry or maroon coloured lippy. I’ve gone for the Clarins Rouge Eclat Lipstick in Red Wine, which is super moisturising on the lips and stays put for hours.

Binky has gone all out this October and has even tried out some spooky nail art 

And there you have it – a ghoulish yet glam Halloween look that you don’t have to be an artist to create. You can get all the products I used from online beauty boutique Escentual.com.

If you’re not big on fancy dress but still want to inject a little bit of Halloween spooky spirit to your beauty routine on October 31, why not try out some nail art? I’ve been experimenting with fun Halloween nail looks using my Binky London nail polishes.

Enjoy your Halloween celebrations, whatever you choose to dress up as!

Lots of love,
