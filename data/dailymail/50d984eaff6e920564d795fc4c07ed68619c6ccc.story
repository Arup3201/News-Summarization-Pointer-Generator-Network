A destitute elderly widow who could not afford to pay for her husband's burial has been presented with a cheque to cover the cost of the ceremony from well-wishers touched by her plight.

Elsie Smith, 91, was planning to sell everything she owned so that her beloved husband, Joe, could be buried in the same cemetery as their relatives in Snohomish, Washington.

Mrs Smith said she was 'dumbfounded' when she learned viewers who saw her story on a local news channel in Seattle had raised $12,000 to help pay for her late husband's burial.
