What a contest. What drama. And it came in the shape of the proverbial game of two halves.

Atlanta led 21-0 at the break,  but 22 unanswered points from Detroit saw the Lions clinch a stunning victory.

And what a denouement. Detroit’s season has been plagued with kicking woes, and Matt Prater looked as though he had blown it by scuffing a 43-yard field goal attempt wide of the right upright.

But with four seconds on the clock, he was handed a second chance  due to a delay of game penalty. This time, he made no mistake from 48-yards and sent the Lions to 6-2.

The preamble was all about Calvin Johnson and Detroit’s stingy defense. As it happened, neither showed up at Wembley.

But Golden Tate did, putting on 151 receiving yards and a breathtaking 59-yard touchdown to give the Lions a foothold in the third quarter. It was his fourth 110-yard plus outing in five games as the Super Bowl-winner continues to thrive in Detroit after his move from Seattle.

While Matt Ryan gave glimpses of why he is the tenth best-paid athlete on the planet in the first half, he faded badly, throwing two interceptions. Stud receiver Julio Jones also dropped a straightforward catch to hand the Lions the chance to steal the game.

Matt Stafford, missing three tight ends and his favourite target, had struggled, throwing wildly and failing to find wide open receivers.

But like last week’s come-from-behind victory against the Saints, when it mattered, Stafford produced a game-winning final drive from Detroit’s seven yard line.

The Falcons, who suffered a fifth straight defeat, will look long and hard at themselves after this shattering loss.

With a battered offensive line, there were fears that Mike Smith’s men would be eaten alive by one of the NFL’s most fearsome front sevens. After all, they had mustered just 20 points in their last two games.

But it didn’t start like that, as Ryan surgically sliced apart the Lions from the off.

A strong opening drive saw little interior pressure from the Lions’ front four. Allowed ample time in the pocket, Ryan marched up the field, connecting with Jones, White and Levine Toilolo before Devonta Freeman clutched the ball from the air one-handed for a seven-yard touchdown pass.

It was the first time the Lions conceded had a touchdown in the first half for four games.

After Stafford’s opening drive stalled, Ryan was on the move again.

Using a variety of receivers, the returning Harry Douglas made a key interception on third and eight, and the Falcons were perched in the Red Zone.

Ryan made it look easy, finding a tip-toeing Bear Pascoe wide open for his first Atlanta touchdown.

By the end of the first quarter, the crowd were stunned. Ryan was almost faultless, completing nine out of ten passes for 104 yards with two touchdowns.

The second quarter brought more misery for Detroit with Nick Fairley suffering an injury to his right knee. As the giant defensive tackle grappled with Ryan, team-mate Ndamukong Suh fell into his leg. Fairley hobbled off with a suspected MCL tear.

And the Lions slipped further behind just before the break. Steven Jackson became the 19th athlete to eclipse the 11,000-yard rushing barrier and went over on the next down to make it a three-score game.

If all the talk at half-time was of another Wembley blowout, whatever was said in the Lions locker room worked.

Using screen passes to great success, they avoided a blowout thanks to Matt Prater’s field goal, and Stafford combined with Tate with that sensational 59-yard touchdown to bring the loudest cheer of the afternoon.

On third and 35, Stafford scrambled and bought himself time before lobbing a laser to Tate, who had eluded Atlanta’s shoddy secondary. Breathtaking stuff.

It was Stafford’s 119th touchdown pass in Lions history, a franchise record.

As Atlanta continued to implode, Detroit reduced the deficit further with another Prater field goal.

And the gap was cut to two points after Stafford found Theo Riddick for a five-yard touchdown. Stafford failed to connect with Tate for the two-point conversion but they got the ball back after Jones’ costly drop.

Both teams head into a mid-season bye and while the flight home will be a jubilant one for Detroit, one imagines it will be a sombre mood on the plane to Georgia.

And while Falcons owner Arthur Blank has said he has no plans for a change of head coach, their record is a meagre one. And this defeat will hurt.
