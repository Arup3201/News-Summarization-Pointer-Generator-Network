A father has spoken of the terrifying moment his six-year-old daughter was savagely attacked by a pack of six dogs.

Maya Wicksteed was visiting a neighbour with her father, Bruce, at Baldivis, south of Perth, when she was set upon by three Arab Bullmastiffs and three other dogs.

She suffered horrific 
facial injuries in the relentless attack, but is now in a stable condition after undergoing cosmetic surgery on her face.

Recalling the ordeal on Friday afternoon, Mr Wicksteed said his daughter was 'a screaming ball of sand and blood.'

He had been fixing a vehicle near the property when he heard his daughter's screams.

Mr Wicksteed described 'a horrible feeling in my gut' when he realised what had happened.

He told how he ran over and saw the neighbour had come to Maya's aid by laying over her to shield her from the four-foot-tall, 130-pound dogs.

'I realized Maya was lying underneath him and his wife was lying down in the path of the dogs to try to shield my daughter,' Wicksteed said reported Perth Now.

'I feared for my life. I picked up a length of hose and just started whipping them.'

Mr Wicksteed said he then grabbed his daughter and ran towards the house as the vicious dogs chased after them.

'As we got closer to the door, I was just praying that it was unlocked,' he said.

'I slammed the door on them as they were jumping up.'

'Police later told me she had been dragged over a 130-foot area,' he said to Perth Now.

'I'm so grateful, they quite selflessly 
laid themselves down literally in the line of fire and formed a human 
shield to protect her,' he said to ABC.net.au.

A hospital spokeswoman at Princess Margaret Hospital said today Maya was in a stable condition and was 'doing quite well.'

Decision: The Rockingham Mayor, Barry Sammels, said a decision on the impounded dogs' future will be made once investigations are complete

The three Arab Bullmastiffs, belonging to the neighbour's son, have been voluntarily surrendered.

The owner is reported to have been visiting his father at the address where the attack occurred, which was posted with 'Beware of the dog' signs.

They are thought to have been used to control pigs on the land.

Mr Wicksteed said, 'They are a killing machine -- if a dog can't differentiate between a pig and a little girl, there's an issue.'

The City of Rockingham stated it is still trying to locate the other three dogs that were part of a pack responsible for the attack.

The Rockingham Mayor, Barry Sammels, saidÂ  a decision on the impounded dogs' future will be made once investigations into the incident are complete.

'It may be that we fine the owner of the dog, it may be that we euthanase the dogs ourselves, or it could be, and I'm not suggesting this will be the case, that the dogs may be released back to the owner,' ' he said to ABC.net.au.
