Former Everton and Birmingham forward James McFadden has revealed that he is waiting for the right offer to return to football, following his release from Motherwell in May.

The 31-year-old, who has 48 international caps for Scotland, stated that he has received plenty of offers, but has been unwilling to accept anything thus far.

'Most of the offers have been from abroad but they've not excited me too much and I'm quite indecisive so I'm holding off for something that will excite me,' McFadden told BBC Radio Scotland.

Despite opting to turn down all offers to this point, McFadden continued by clarifying that he is ready should the right deal be offered to him.

'I'm still on the look-out for a club and keeping myself fit. There's definitely a lot more football left in me and if I'm ever asked then I'm ready.'

The striker scored 13 goals for Birmingham in 67 league starts, after the Midlands club paid Everton £4.75m for his services in January 2008.

Following that, he returned to Everton for a second spell on Merseyside, before leaving for Sunderland on a free a year later.

McFadden re-signed for his boyhood club Motherwell in February 2013, until his release in May left him searching for a return to football.

The Scot admits he is taking his return to football one step at a time, and was insistent that he has to consider his family's future as well as his own.

'I'm just kind of weighing (the offers) up and seeing what the best one is for myself football-wise but also my family as well, I've got to take them into consideration.'
