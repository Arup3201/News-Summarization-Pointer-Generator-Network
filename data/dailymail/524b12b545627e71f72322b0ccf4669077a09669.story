Music and cycling fans will descend on a 16th century stately home for a four-day festival to mark the start of the Tour de France this year.

Rapha Tempest Festival, at Broughton Hall estate in the Yorkshire Dales, will host top indie acts - as well as bike races, film nights, and food markets - over the first weekend in July.

The unique event will coincide with the first leg of this year's Tour de France, which starts in Leeds on July 5 and spirals up through some of Britain's most treacherous hills.

The landscaped gardens were created in 1597 and have been preserved to this day by the Tempest family, one of England's oldest Catholic landed gentry families

Bespoke on-site camping is offered at the estate, which dates back 900 years.

Broughton Hall estate, in Skipton, near York, has been in the hands of the Tempest family since 1066, when they came over from France.

They are still one of England's oldest Catholic landed gentry families.

The current building, housed by the 32nd Tempest, was erected in 1597, and an extensive conservatory has since been built.

The estate consists of 3,000 acres of private parkland, farmland, woodland and moors.

The tracks are already being constructed for the four-day cycling festival in and around the estate

The Yorkshire Dales attract cyclists from across the world all year round to test themselves on the winding hills

Organisers assure keen cyclists there will be bike parking with 24-hour security.

Yorkshire's bid to host the Grand Depart of the 101st Tour de France was accepted in 2012 (months after Bradley Wiggins tore through Paris, pictured) in his yellow jersey

On Saturday July 5, hundreds of cyclists will set off from Leeds towards Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

From the steps of the 19th century Town Hall, the riders will head northwest out of the city centre and into the countryside.

They will pass Harewood House, home of the Lascelles family for over 250 years, before they head to Skipton, the gateway to the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

Up to this point the route is fairly flat, but once they enter the iconic Dales the terrain gets steeper as the riders race a semi-circular route across the contours of the valleys.

They head up to the north east edge of the National Park, before sweeping south through Leyburn and the cathedral city of Ripon.

The competitors will rejoin flat roads as they speed towards the pretty spa town of Harrogate.

There, the first yellow jersey wearer of the Tour will be announced.

Stage 2, out of 21, starts in nearby York.

A third stage on July 7 will start in London, which hosted the Grand Depart seven years ago.

Yorkshire's successful bid to host the start of the 101st Tour de France was announced in December 2012.

A statement from the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), whichs runs the event, said: 'After an outstanding 2012 for British cycling, marked by the historical victory of Bradley Wiggins on the Tour de France, the United Kingdom will again hold pride of place in 2014.'

Since then, organisers have been working full-time planning the route.

The Team Sky line-up has yet to be announced.

Last year, British cyclist Chris Froome, then 28, led the nine-person team into the race, starting in Corsica.
