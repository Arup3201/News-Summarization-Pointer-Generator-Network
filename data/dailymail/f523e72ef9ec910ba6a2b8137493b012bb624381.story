A 'deceitful' mother pretended to be dying of cancer so she could pocket hundreds of pounds raised for her by sympathetic workmates.

Twisted Teresa Clay told 'lie after lie' to concerned colleagues and bosses at the manufacturing firm that employed her - and was given time off on full pay for bogus hospital treatment.

The 42-year-old claimed she was suffering from throat cancer, and said she could only work mornings while undergoing radiotherapy.

Cancer scam: Chesterfield magistrates court heard how Teresa Clay, 42, of Ripley, Derbys, told lie after lie to work colleagues with one even completing a ten-mile charity run which raised £300

One friend at the company even completed a ten-mile charity run for her, raising £300, and others chipped in after Clay said she needed a dialysis machine for a fake kidney complaint.

But the deception, which included a string of other lies including a claim she was being stalked by an ex-partner, was uncovered when she left for another job.

Clay, of Ripley, Derbys, was reported to the police and admitted admitted fraud by making false claims that she was terminally ill when she appeared at Chesterfield Magistrates’ Court.

The hearing was told she was paid £3,618 she wasn’t entitled to by Storm DFX in Alfreton, Derbys. The offences took place between August 2011 and May this year.

Prosecutor Mike Treharne said: 'It’s a tale of deceit that’s really quite awful.

'The workforce were completely taken in by her deceit. Work colleagues took it upon themselves to do fund-raising.

Clay was given a six month jail term, suspended for one year and ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work (file picture not of Clay)

'One did a ten-mile run and paid £300 to her. But there was no problem with her kidneys and she did not have cancer.'

The court heard that by November last year, three months after she started her job, Clay had told bosses she could only take liquid food. She went on to claim that a former partner had thrown acid over her car, and it had blown up.

She was given time off for non-existent cancer treatment, and her kind-hearted employers even hired her a car for four weeks while she claimed hers was being fixed.

Magistrates imposed a six-month jail term, suspended for one year.

They also ordered Clay to do 200 hours unpaid work, and pay £3,618 compensation to Storm DFX and £300 to the workmate she conned.

Stacey White, defending, said Clay, who has no previous convictions, did not accept all the allegations but it was accepted it was 'a fairly despicable offence'.

She told the court that at the time of the deception, Clay had debts that had 'spiralled out of control'.

Ms White added: 'She regrets her actions every day. She feels embarrassed and ashamed. She hasn’t told her family.'

The hearing was also told Clay, who lives with her teenage son and now works as a receptionist for the National Grid, was on medication for depression.
