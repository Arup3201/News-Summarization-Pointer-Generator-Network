From the spectacular setting to the starry front row (and not to mention the covetable clothes), the Chanel show is one of the highlights of the fashion calendar.

And creative director Karl Lagerfeld pulled out all the stops to make his SS15 show Paris fashion week's most talked about spectacle.

The silver-haired design maestro called in good friends Cara Delevingne, Joan Smalls and Kendall Jenner and Georgia May Jagger, as well as the world's richest model, Gisele, to walk in his show.

That's one stylish protest! Karl Lagerfeld called in all the biggest names to walk in his SS15 show in Paris today. The model pack was headed up by Cara Delevingne, who carried a quilted megaphone

Previous seasons have seen him transform his catwalk into a giant Chanel-themed shopping mall but this time around, he created Boulevard Chanel No.5 and staged a street protest lead by Cara with a megaphone.

His model army, including Edie Campbell, Gigi Hadid and Charlotte Free, carried signs emblazoned with the words: 'Tweed is better than tweet', 'Be your own stylist' and 'History is her story.'

There's a super in the building! Brazilian model Gisele, who is the world's top-earning model, also took to the catwalk in a beige and white cardigan dress and matching boots

Model army: Karl updated Chanel's iconic tweed for SS15 by offering it in flared trousers and teamed with colourful blouses 

Cara, who has previously described Karl as a 'father figure', headed up the demo chanting 'What do we want?' into her quilted megaphone (the new IT accessory?) - all watched from the front row by Alexa Chung, Poppy Delevingne, Laura Bailey and Kris Jenner.

Tweed suits, as always, came in abundance. There were flared tweed trousers, purple hued mini skirts, cardigan dresses, and mosaic cocktail dresses in a melange of bright colours.

In keeping with the feminist theme, Karl sent a lone male model down the catwalk carrying a 'He For She' protest sign, perhaps a nod to Emma Watson's HeForShe UN campaign for gender equality?

Must-have accessory? Gisele really got into the spirit of things at the SS15 show armed with her quilted Chanel megaphone

Call to action: Cara, who lead the pack shouting 'What do we want?' was joined on the runway by best pal Georgia May Jagger

I predict a riot! Cara looked like she was enjoying her day at work as she closed the Chanel show in a wide-leg trouser suit

Follow the leader: Cara, dressed in a tweet suit and colourful floral boots, seemed to be enjoying leading the pack

Here they come! His model army carried signs emblazoned with the words: 'Tweed is better than tweet', 'Be your own stylist' and 'History is her story' down the catwalk

Making a statement: The models marched down the catwalk holding signs such as 'Boys should get pregnant too' and 'make fashion not war'

Cara's army: Miss Delevingne lead the model army down the runway in Paris today in a show that was hotly anticipated 

While she may be fashion's most famous face, Cara has been very selective in her show choices.

She opened the Topshop Unique show in London (she also currently fronts their campaign), but swapped the runway for the front row at Burberry Prorsum.

While Kendall Jenner is taking the fashion world by the storm, she has her fair share of haters.

The 18-year-old's meteoric rise as a professional runway model has sparked resentment from some of her catwalk colleagues, according to a new report.

At New York Fashion Week, Kendall was allegedly bullied by her fellow models, who even went so far as to put cigarettes out in her drink.

A source at NYFW told In Touch Weekly: 'The other models worked so hard to get a spot on the runway and didn't think it was fair that she was there.'

Say what? The models each carried a sign or banner with bold statements emblazoned in both English and French

Picking carefully: While she may be fashion's most famous face, Cara has been very selective in her show choices but as a good friend of Karl and a current face of Chanel, it made sense for her to close today's show

Independent women: Cara, who has described Karl as a fatherly figure, headed up the demo chanting 'What do we want?' into her quilted megaphone (the new IT accessory?)

And in true Mean Girls fashion, some of the models began taking their resentment out on the young reality star.

'They started acting b****y,' the insider said, 'Some even put out their cigarettes in Kendall's drink!'

Meanwhile, the model recently revealed she must 'work harder' if she wants to be taken seriously by the fashion world.

She said: "I want to be high fashion. I want to be taken seriously.

"People think that this [success] just came to me. But it didn't. What I have has almost worked against me."

Kendall also explained that her reality television roots had made it difficult for her during castings.

She added: "People didn't take me seriously as a model…I went on castings and some people weren't feeling me because of my name. But it was great when people didn't recognise me. I was like, 'Thank you. Please don't recognise me.'"
