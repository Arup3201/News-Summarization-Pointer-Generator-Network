A bipartisan group of Congressman has introduced a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their staffs from using taxpayer money to fly first class.

The 'If Our Military Has to Fly Coach Then so Should Congress Act' would place the same restrictions on the legislative branch that are already on employees of the executive branch, a press release announcing the bill states.

It is sponsored by Democratic Reps. John Barrow and Raul Ruiz and Republican Reps. Walter Jones and Paul Gosar.

'As representatives of the American people, we in Congress have a 
responsibility to wisely use the people’s money,' Jones said in a 
statement. 'Members of the House and Senate should never secure their 
own 
luxury travel at taxpayer expense, but they especially should not do so 
when our nation is buried $17 trillion deep in debt.'

The 'If Our Military Has to Fly Coach Then so Should Congress Act' would only allow members and their staff to fly first class on the taxpayer's dime if they have a disability or a major medical issue

Should taxpayers pay for Congress to fly first class?

Members
 of Congress are given a Member Representational Allowance at the start 
of each year that includes money for staff salaries, travel, office 
space, office supplies, mail and other general office expenses.

Each Representative receives between $1,183,717 to $1,356,445 each year for these expenses. The amount each office receives varies depending on how close or far away the district it serves is from the District of Columbia. The average MRA is $1,243,560.14, the Congressional Research Service estimates.

The base allowance for travel to and from their districts plus the cost of renting an office in their districts is $256,574 for members of the House. However, members can use as much or as little of their MRA for travel as they like.

Senators receive between $2,960,743 to $4,685,316, and an average allowance of $3,209,992.27. They face some restrictions on use of the money as well, but like members of the House, it is up to them to determine how much of their allowance money they spend on travel.

The 'If Our Military Has to Fly Coach Then so Should Congress' would not place any additional restrictions on travel other than disallowing members to fly first class.

'It's a very simple bill. All it does is prohibit members of Congress 
from using taxpayer funds to purchase first-class airfare,' Gosar said in a statement.

'If members of our military can't fly first class using taxpayer funds, neither should members of Congress.'

The legislation makes an exception for members and their staff who have disabilities or major medical needs.

Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth introduced legislation similar to the group's bipartisan bill earlier this month.

In
 addition to the exemptions included in the bipartisan bill, Duckworth's
 legislation would allow members to travel first class if the flight is 
five or more hours or if no coach class seats are available.

Ruiz said he was sponsoring the bipartisan bill because members of Congress 'should not receive special privileges at the expense of hard working taxpayers.'

'It’s wrong that members of Congress can purchase luxury airfare with 
taxpayer money when many families in my district and across the county 
are struggling to make ends meet,' he said in a statement.

Of the special airport privileges members of Congress would still have access to if the bill passes are their dedicated parking spaces at Reagan National Airport.

The spaces, which cost nearly a quarter million dollars a year, are paid for by the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, not taxpayers.
