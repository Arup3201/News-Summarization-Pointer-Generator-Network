Shabazz Suleman is feared to have fled to Syria to join ISIS militants 

An 18-year-old boy in the middle of A-level preparation is the latest youngster feared to have fled to Syria to join jIhadists. 

Shabazz Suleman left his home in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, earlier this year while on study leave for his exams from the town's Royal Grammar School. 

It is not yet known whether Shabazz has gone to carry out aid work or fight.  

Thames Valley Police confirmed it was working with Royal Grammar School, rated outstanding by Ofsted, since his departure.

Counter terrorism officers are reportedly planning a visit, as it was revealed a Twitter account used by Shabazz to post Islamic content has been removed.

Former pupils at the school include England rugby players Nick Beale, Matt Dawson, and Tom Rees, in addition to golfer Luke Donald and the late rugby player Nick Duncombe.

A letter sent to parents of pupils informed them the force's Prevention Team would be visiting to give youngsters a talk.

'I wish to reassure you that we are working with the relevant authorities and will continue to do so.

'We are also aware that there will be interest amongst the school and we have arranged for all pupils at the school to be spoken to by ‘The Prevent Team’ from Thames Valley Police,' head teacher Roy Page, wrote. 

'Shabazz was a pupil at the Royal Grammar School High Wycombe from September 2007 until May 2014, when he left on examination leave to take his A levels in Economics, Psychology and History.

'We have fully cooperated with the relevant authorities and will continue to do so.'

Supt Ed Mclean, Local Police Area Commander for Wycombe, said: 'Whilst I would not look to comment on any specific case I would like to say that my team have been liaising and supporting the Royal Grammar School and we continue to work with the communities of Wycombe to identify and prevent vulnerable people from travelling to Syria by highlighting the associated dangers.

'I would encourage anyone who is concerned that persons may be planning to travel to Syria to contact us or trusted community leaders. 

'Anyone who does travel to Syria will find themselves the focus of a police investigation.'

Shabazz was a pupil at The Royal Grammar School High Wycombe which is said to be working with police 

A friend of the Shabazz, who did not want to be named, said he had spoken with the youngster about the situation in Syria where extremist Islamic militants have waged a campaign of violence against civilians, military troops and rebel fighters. 

'Before leaving to go to Syria, I spoke to him at length about what he thought of the situation over there - and he expressed support for what he called the Islamic Caliphate,' he told the Tab newspaper. 

But the boy's mother insisted her son had gone to Syria to offer aid in conflict zones. 

Wycombe MP Steve Baker said he was aware someone from the community may have gone over to Iraq or Syria and strongly advised people not to travel to those areas.

Mr Baker said: 'I was aware there was a possibility a person had gone over. I’m also aware that it’s not known whether he is fighting or delivering aid.

'He has apparently previously been involved in providing aid in Syria.

'In any event it’s not advisable for anyone to travel to Iraq or Syria. I am very grateful to the whole Muslim community in denouncing IS.

'It’s absolutely clear they are denouncing ISIL and the task and responsibility of all politicians is to hold our community together so that all our people can flourish.

'Clearly the departure of people from Wycombe to Syria is a challenge for us.

'I stood up in the Commons and said that the first young man had acted disgracefully towards our community and the Prime Minister agreed.

'I am absolutely convinced that the vast majority of British Muslims just want to live their lives in peace. It’s critical that we all unite to combat extremism.'

The boy's mother has denied claims he has travelled to the Middle East for violent reasons, telling the press: 'He has gone to do aid work there'.   

It comes as the mother of 15-year-old Yusra Hussein made an emotional plea for her daughter to come home. 

The schoolgirl from Bristol is feared to have fled to Syria to either join ISIS fighters or was lured there after joining a jihadist dating website.
