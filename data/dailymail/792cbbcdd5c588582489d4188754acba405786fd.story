Microsoft’s CEO announced a broad companywide shakeup just as many tech industry analysts are proclaiming the ‘death of the PC’ amid sharply declining personal computer sales and the tepid performance of the Windows 8 operating system.

Steve Ballmer said Thursday that the changes mean the company is ‘rallying behind a single strategy’ with an aim to take the unwieldy tech giant ‘in a bold new direction.'

While it has been widely anticipated, it's too early to tell how well the reorganization—the company’s largest in five years—will help Microsoft compete with more nimble rivals like Apple and Google.

'Bold new direction': CEO Steve Ballmer announced the largest overhaul the tech giant has seen in five years

Some insiders weren’t wholly optimistic.

‘You don't make massive, sweeping changes like this unless something is wrong,’ said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial, pointing to Wednesday's reports of declining PC shipments around the world.

Worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 11 percent in the April-June period, according to data from research firms Gartner and IDC. Gartner Inc. said the PC industry is now experiencing the longest decline in its history, as shipments dropped for the fifth consecutive quarter.

Kurt DelBene, the former president of 
Microsoft Office, will retire. His departure follows that of gaming 
chief Don Mattrick, now CEO of Zynga, and Steven Sinofsky, formerly head
of the Windows unit.

Microsoft's
lackluster stock performance has amplified speculation that the company
might consider replacing Steve Ballmer, who took over when co-founder 
Bill Gates stepped down as CEO 13 years ago.

Bold: Ballmer says it will be bold, but others wonder if the changes aren't just a scramble to catch up with rivals in a stalled corner of the tech market

Analysts have blamed a massive 
consumer migration to tablets and other mobile devices for the falloff. 
But many observers also believe Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system 
-which comes installed on most new PCs- has turned consumers off.

The company's new divisions include 
engineering, marketing and business development. Microsoft named veteran
executive Julie Larson-Green head of its devices and studios 
engineering group, overseeing hardware development, games, music and 
entertainment. She had been promoted in November to lead all Windows 
software and hardware engineering after Steven Sinofsky, the president 
of its Windows and Windows Live operations, left the company shortly 
after the launch of Windows 8.

Terry Myerson will lead Microsoft's operating systems and engineering group, namely Windows. Qi Lu will head applications and services.

Ballmer stressed the company's focus on ‘one Microsoft’ in his memo. He said Microsoft will move forward operating as a cohesive company rather than a ‘collection of divisional strategies.’

‘Although we will deliver multiple devices and services to execute and monetize the strategy, the single core strategy will drive us to set shared goals for everything we do. We will see our product line holistically, not as a set of islands,’ Ballmer wrote.

The shake-up is being driven by competitive pressures as two of Microsoft's once much-smaller rivals, Apple and Google, have emerged as the technology trendsetters. In a world that increasingly revolves around mobile devices and Internet services, Microsoft has been scrambling to adapt to the upheaval. The company wants to ensure its relevance in the future while protecting the personal computer franchise that has always generated most of its revenue.

The changing of the guard has already been noted by Wall Street. Both Apple and Google boast market values higher than Microsoft, despite a surge in Microsoft's stock price during the past three months.

Outdated? Microsoft hopes to condense some of its more far flung arms into a more cohesive company dubbed by CEO Steve Ballmer 'One Microsoft' to compete with nimbler rivals Apple and Google

The reorganization could be Ballmer's attempt at placating shareholders with a dramatic overhaul that appears to borrow elements of Apple's and Google's set-ups. The winnowing of Microsoft's disparate divisions and Ballmer's rallying cry for ‘One Microsoft’ suggests the company is trying to make its products work together more seamlessly, much like Apple has been doing since the late Steve Jobs returned as that company's CEO in the late 1990s.

At the same time, Ballmer appears determined to eliminate bureaucracy in hopes of making Microsoft operate more like a nimble startup able to quickly innovate - a goal that Google CEO Larry Page set out to achieve when he took over leadership of that company two years ago.

Janney Capital Markets analyst Yun Kim said the reorganization helps align Microsoft's various divisions around its devices and services strategy, but he added that he's taking a ‘wait and see’ approach.

‘We continue to look for signs on how the company can leverage its success in the Xbox business to re-energize its current efforts in the tablet and smartphone markets,’ Kim wrote in a note to investors.

BGC Financial's Gillis noted that major reorganizations ‘can serve as a negative distraction for months before potentially offering benefits.’

Microsoft shares rose $1.01, or nearly 3 percent, to close at $35.71 on Thursday. The Redmond, Washington-based company's stock is up 32 percent since the start of the year, compared with a 17 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 index.

More woes: In addition to its industry-wide woes, Microsoft's Windows 8 is widely seen as a flop and likely added to pressures leading up to the shakeup
