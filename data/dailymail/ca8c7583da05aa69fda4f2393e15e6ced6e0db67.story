A mother advised to abort her baby daughter after scans showed her organs were on the outside of her body has spoken of her relief that she saved her.

Nine-month-old Piper Smith was given just a 25 per cent chance of survival when she was born with her bladder, intestine and liver outside her body.

Her mother Amanda Smith, 29, was told she should consider aborting her unborn child after a rare weakness of the abdominal wall was spotted at her 11 week scan.

It meant unborn Piper grew in the womb with the organs outside her body - and was not expected to survive labour.

Fighting: Nine-month-old Piper Smith (with mother Amanda) was given just a 25 per cent chance of survival when she was born with her bladder, intestine and liver outside her body

Survivor: Piper undergoing treatment in London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. Her bladder, which is outside her body, is wrapped in cling-film to keep her alive

But remarkably, she was successfully born at 35 weeks with all her organs intact and fully-functioning.

She is now being kept alive with cling film which keeps her organs in place and moist.

Mrs Smith and her husband Wayne, 23, are now waiting for surgeons to perform a six-hour operation to put Piper's organs back inside her body and then stretch muscle over her stomach.

After that, she is expected to have a good quality of life, making her mother even more relieved she chose not to have her daughter aborted.

Mrs Smith, a mother-of-two, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, said: 'The doctors offered me a termination, but I didn't feel I could have one - I wanted to give her a chance. And she has been a miracle. She is a little fighter.'

Medics diagnosed her unborn baby with two conditions - bladder exstrophy and exomphalosÂ  - after spotting unusual lumps on her scan at 11 weeks.

Doctors said the foetus was unlikely 
to survive, even if she made it through childbirth but Mr and Mrs Smith 
decided to keep her.

Mrs Smith added: 'It was really scary when Piper was born. She was very poorly. It was like she was inside out.

'It was really hard as I wasn't allowed to pick her up as she had to go straight in to the incubator.

'The doctors said she had a 50 per cent chance of survival with her intestine and liver outside the body [a condition known as exomphalos].

Doctors said Piper had a 50 per cent chance of survival with her intestine and liver outside the body. When they saw her bladder was outside, this fell to 25 per cent

In her short life Piper has already been in intensive care twice

'When they saw the bladder was outside too [bladder exstrophy] they said it went down to 25 per cent. It was terrifying thinking she might not make it.'

In the meantime, Piper's liver and intestine are still outside her body, but skin has grown over them making it look like she has a hernia.

She is also living with her bladder sitting on the outside of her stomach - wrapped in cling film to keep it moist.

Mrs Smith was due to be induced at 38 weeks, but was rushed by ambulance to specialists at University College Hospital, London, at 35 weeks, on June 26.

Piper spent four days in intensive 
care and was eventually sent home from Great Ormond Street 
Hospital after five weeks.

But at eight weeks she was rushed back to Great Ormond Street with a twist in her bowel and spent five days in intensive care.

Piper,
who also suffers from spina bifida - which her family hopes will be 
correctable - will need a colostomy bag to pass solids until she is at 
least four-years-old.

Her
mother said: 'I don't think Piper is aware of her organs being on the 
outside rather than on the inside. She is not in any pain.

'She is starting to sit up now and 
she is a very happy baby. We are really hoping that she will be able to 
walk eventually. I have to check on Piper more than a normal baby - she 
cannot roll on her side as her organs are there so we have to be very 
careful.'

Relief: Piper's mother was told she should consider aborting her unborn child after a rare weakness of the abdominal wall was spotted at her 11 week scan

After surgery Piper is expected to have a good quality of life and her parents hope that her spina bifida will be correctable

Mrs Smith has to change the 
cling-film dressing on Piper's bladder every time she changes her nappy -
about five times a day.

Cling film is used to wrap Piper's bladder as it reduces the amount of fluids and body heat lost from her abdomen.

She said: 'It is amazing that a household product like cling film is doing such an important job and keeping Piper alive.

'We have to change the cling film every time we change Piper's nappy so that is about five times a day.

'The hospital gave us industrial size cling film rolls so we have enough supplies. We keep rolls of it in our changing bag.'

Doctors have told Piper's parents it is rare to suffer from both conditions. Bladder exstrophy, a congenital birth defect, occurs in one in every 40,000 births and affects two to three times more boys than girls.

It is not known what causes bladder exstrophy, but the problem occurs somewhere between the fourth and tenth week of pregnancy when various organs, tissues and muscles begin to form layers that separate, divide and fold.

The skin over the lower abdominal wall does not form properly, so the bladder is open and exposed on the outside of the abdomen.

Exomphalos, the other condition she suffers from, affects one in every 2,500 children born each year, occurs when a child's abdominal wall does not develop fully while in the womb.
