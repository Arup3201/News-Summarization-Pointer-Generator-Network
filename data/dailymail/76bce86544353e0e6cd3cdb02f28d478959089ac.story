Two Arizona college students have been charged with alcohol-related misdemeanors in connection to the fatal fall of an Arizona State University freshman in March.

David Siegel and Matthew Farberov appeared Wednesday in Maricopa County Superior Court and entered not guilty pleas in the case of Naomi McClendon.

The 18-year-old woman from Manhattan, Kansas, plunged 10 floors to her death March 30 from an apartment complex near ASU's campus.

Tempe police said McClendon initially attended an 'all-you-can-drink' party thrown by ASU fraternity members and surveillance video showed her stumbling and intoxicated when she entered the residential building.

Siegal and Farberov, both 20, are charged with minor possession of liquor and failing to require identification.

Another defendant, 21-year-old Alex Kraus, faces the same charges but now lives in New Jersey. A judge reset his court appearance for October 16.

Meanwhile, Siegel and Farberov are due back in court September 24.

Matthew
 Farberov's LinkedIn page revealed that the 20-year-old is an ROTC cadet
 with the U.S. Army. He is expected to graduate from ASU in 2016 with a 
bachelor's degree in criminal justice and criminology.

The
 website lists his role with Alpha Epsilon Pi as academic chair and 
pursuer. The Greek organization lost its certification earlier this 
year.

Describing his 
career goals, the college student wrote that he is hoping to serve as a 
commissioned military intelligence officer on active duty. 

On the night of May 29, McClendon attended a gathering organized by the ASU fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi in a Temple apartment building.

According to authorities, the underage student was served vodka at the party; a short time later, she fell to her death from the 10th floor of another off-campus building.

A surveillance video captured the moment the inebriated 18-year-old straddled a balcony railing, then lay on top of it and slid off the metal surface to her death.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, the 
Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control conducted an 
investigation, which found that no one at the frat party was checking 
IDs to make sure that guests were 21 or older before they were served 
alcohol.

According to 
the report by the state agency released last week, and cited by The State Press, Farberov, Siegel and 
two other men were acting as security guards at the party. 

The report also stated that a friend who accompanied Ms McClendon decided to leave the Alpha Epsilon Pi party and asked a passing motorist to drive them to another location.

The driver later told police McClendon and her friend were both drunk, but the 18-year-old was slurring her words.

Upon
 reaching their destination, McClendon's friend reportedly took her up to an 
apartment on the tenth floor where another party was in progress.

While
 the other guests were inside the unit, the freshman went out onto the 
balcony, climbed the railing and tumbled to her death

Naomi McClendon had only left home to start school last year. She was part of a band, where she played keyboard, with boyfriend Noah Schmidt – he lashed out angrily online after hearing of her death.

‘You took away the most amazing person you ever created. F**k you God,’ he wrote on Facebook.
