'Considering the incredibly challenging circumstances, we are extremely grateful to the people all over the country who came out to experience The Interview on the first day of its unconventional release,' said Rory Bruer, President Worldwide Distribution for Sony Pictures, in a statement.

'The audience reaction was fantastic - the limited release, in under 10% of the amount of theaters originally planned, featured numerous sell-outs and a first-day gross over $1 million.'

This despite receiving mixed to poor reviews from most critics. 

And though Sony and Google representatives are keeping quiet about actual numbers, Then Interview has topped the most viewed list on YouTube and Google since it became available on Tuesday to rent for $5.99 or purchase for $16.99.

The film is also getting a lot of viewers who are illegally downloading the film.

After being pirated and posted online within an hour of its release, the film had downloaded 750,000 times in just the first 20 hours.

In line, online: The film is also still topping the most popular charts on YouTube and Google Play

Bad news: Sadly, the film is also being illegally downloaded a whole lot, reaching 750,000 times in just 20 hours

What's more, Deadline reports that 300,000 of these downloads come from a video sharing platform in China where the film will not be released.

China is also the biggest ally of North Korea, who many, including the FBI and President Obama, believe was behind the hacking of Sony in an attempt to stop the release of this film. 

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un denied this claim, and just this week numerous cybersecurity experts have stated they too do not feel the country was responsible, noting that it was most likely an inside job.
