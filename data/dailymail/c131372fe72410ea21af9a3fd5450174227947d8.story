A world-renowned art historian and former 
head of education at the V&A museum died in squalor after a secret 
battle with depression, an inquest heard today.

Ronald Parkinson, 67, lived a hermit-like existence from the living room of his home in Tooting, south west London, surrounded by empty takeaway wrappers and piles of dirty clothes.

Mr Parkinson was found dead, lying face down on the floor naked with some food, which had been left for him five days earlier, completely untouched.

Westminster Coroner's Court heard Parkinson, a noted author on the works of artist John Constable, drank heavily for more than 30 years and battled depression.

'He had a history of depression and alcoholism', said assistant deputy coroner Jean Harkin.

'He was referred to the community mental health team, but unfortunately the patient did not engage with this service.'

Mr Parkinson's cousin, Colin Barrett, the last person to see him alive, said the depression was not known to the academic's friends and former colleagues.

'The doctor's report said he had depression, but this is a complete mystery to those of us in his family, he was the last person to be the suffering from that kind of ailment', he said.

'He was a renowned happy individual, he had happiness around him all the time and it rubbed off on other people.

'That's why he was greatly loved by his colleagues and friends, and those who knew him.'

Mr Parkinson starting drinking heavily in the 1990s, the inquest heard.

As a result he was transferred from his role in the education department at the V&A museum to a different role where a close friend could monitor his progress.

'The situation prevailed until 1998 when the civil service gave him early retirement', said coroner's officer Deborah Plant.

'In retirement, his drinking continued, and although his cousin kept in touch regularly, he gradually was not able to come to visit or receive visitors.'

Mr Parkinson's long-term partner died in March last year, and his declining health and heavy drinking continued unabated.

'We didn't feel the condition deteriorated sharply after the death of his partner, it was an ongoing process of heavy drinking which had been going on for 30 years', said Mr Barrett.

In June last year, Mr Barrett was called to Mr Parkinson's home and was shocked by his appearance and the state of the home.

'He had lank hair which was matted and unwashed', said Ms Plant.

'His clothing was dirty, he was seriously underweight, and the flat was in disarray and appeared close to infestation.'

Mr Barrett, who had previously kept in touch by phone with Mr Parkinson, began to visit frequently to ensure he was looking after himself, but the academic was in an increasingly frail state.

'On one occasion, he had fallen down the stairs and was found unconscious lying wedged in the door way', said Ms Plant.

'His hands were permanently shaking and he was fragile, he could have fallen down the stairs at any time.'

Mr Parkinson was put on an alcohol dependency treatment course, but told workers in September last year he did not want any help.

But when Mr Barrett returned from holiday and went to visit, on November 15, he found Mr Parkinson gasping for water after days of not drinking anything at all.

'I found him in a worse condition than before, the room was in more than a shambles, there was dirt, squalor and litter everywhere', he said.

'It appeared he had been living solely in this room.

'I don't believe he had been able to get out to order alcohol, and may not have been drinking for ten days.'

-Â  Mr Parkinson's cousin

Mr Barrett said his cousin gulped down a glass of water 'like he had been in the desert for days', left him with fresh food, and reported his concerns to Mr Parkinson's GP.

But before community health workers could visit Mr Parkinson, Mr Barrett found his cousin dead on November 20 last year, barricaded into his living room with cushions and cardboard boxes.

No alcohol was in his system when he died, and Mr Barrett said it was a 'miracle' that doctors found no evidence of liver damage from his drinking.

Mr Parkinson studied art history at Clare College, Cambridge, before becoming a widely respected art author and seminal expert on Constable.

He joined the V&A in 1972, holding various roles in the education department and latterly in art conservation, and also had a four-year stint as an assistant keeper at the Tate Gallery's British collection in the mid-70s.

Mr Barrett described his cousin as a modest man who did not like to talk about his own achievements.

'He was always interested in you, and we didn't know about the extent of his publications until after his death', he said.

'His flat was filled with something in the order of 1,500 art books, ranging right across the art history spectrum. It was his passion right until he died.'

Ms Harkin recorded a verdict of death by natural causes after hearing Mr Parkinson, of Tooting, had suffered from coronary artery disease.
