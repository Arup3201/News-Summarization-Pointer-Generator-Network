Boston bombing victim Jeff Bauman Jr and Carlos Arredondo, the cowboy hat wearing hero who helped to save him have spoken out about the strong bond they have developed since that fateful day last month when they were both caught up in the unfolding tragedy.

The photograph of Arredondo, 52, in a cowboy hat, rushing alongside Bauman, 27, and pinching closed a severed artery in one of his shattered legs has become one of the most iconic images of the tragedy encapsulating the day's heroism, suffering and humanity.

Now a new image has emerged of the two, it was taken almost exactly a week after the Boston Marathon bombing and shows Arredondo visiting Bauman in his hospital bed at Boston Medical Center on April 22.

It shows the emotional face-to-face between Buaman and the man that he credits with saving his life.

'When we first saw each other we 
hugged each other and I gave him a kiss on the cheek because it was very
beautiful to see him doing very well,' Arredondo told WHDH.

'He was so happy to see me and he was so thankful. Tears were coming out of his eyes,' he said.

Because
of the amount of pain Bauman has been in, their reunion waited a week to allow him extra time toward his recovery.

Arrendondo wore a similar tan cowboy hat on his head, one he may be forever be remembered by after that now iconic photograph capturing the day's horrific events.

'"You saved my life,"' Arredondo repeated Bauman's words to him which he described as 'very strong' to hear.

'I'm glad that I got to help him,' he added while saying that Bauman will go on to do great things for others.

'When Carlos picked me up and threw me into the wheelchair, then I was like, maybe I am gonna make it,' Bauman previously told WEEI of that desperate moment. 'Before that, no way. I thought I was done.'

The two men have now meet several times at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston  since that awful April afternoon.

A strong bond has grown between them, with Arredondo saying Bauman is helping him to come to terms with what he saw that day.

‘It's constantly in my head, seeing 
the people,’ Arredondo told the Wall Street Journal. ‘I'm at the spot of
the event, seeing the young man I helped, and the young lady who died 
... It's hard to sleep.’

‘It's nice to have a friend, someone that age,’ he says. ‘I don't think this bond is going to end after the cameras go away.’

Pain and suffering are nothing new to the Costa Rican immigrant.

The 52-year-old's eldest son, 20-year-old  Lance Corporal Alexander Arredondo of the U.S. Marine Corps died in action nine years ago.

The father was dealt another devastating blow, 
when his second son Brian, 24, committed suicide just before Christmas 
2011 as the final troops withdrew from the war which killed his brother.

Brian had suffered with depression and battled drug addiction ever since Alexander's death.

He has severed as an inspirational anti-war protester ever since.

Now, he is urging those who were at the bombings to seek 
psychological counseling early, before problems arise.

Arredondo has described how, as most 
people ran for their lives when the explosions went off in Boston, he 
vaulted a fence to get to spectators, many of whom had lost limbs, and 
used his clothes and towels to stanch victims' bleeding.

'I jumped the fence after the first 
explosions and all I saw was a puddle of blood and people with lost 
limbs,' he told ABC News. 'I saw adults, much younger than myself -- 
ladies, men, pretty much everyone was knocked out.'

Mr Arredondo helped
Mr Bauman into a wheelchair that race medical staff had brought and 
said he kept talking to the man so he wouldn't lose consciousness.

'I kept talking to him. I kept saying, 
"Stay with me, stay with me,"' Mr Arredondo, who is a member of the Red 
Cross disaster team, told Maine Today.

A graphic photograph shows the hero seemingly pinching shut the femoral artery on one of Mr Bauman's part-severed legs using his hand as they rush him to ambulances.

The day he learned his elder son had been killed, which also happened to be his 44th birthday, Mr Arredondo ​locked himself in a van with five gallons of gasoline and a propane torch and set the van on fire.

Brave: Seconds after the blast Mr Arredondo was pictured attending to victims

He survived, became a peace activist, and legally changed his name to Alexander Brian Arredondo in 
tribute to his sons. In 2006 he became an American citizen.

When
the bombs went off on April 15, Mr Arredondo and his wife Melida 
Arredondo were in the VIP stands near the Boylston Street finish 
line of the marathon.

They
were waiting for the last of the National Guard runners, representing 
Run for the Fallen Maine, an organization established to honor Marines 
who have been killed since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. One of 
those runners had dedicated the race to Mr Arredondo's son.

'There was blood on the floor, blood everywhere. Then what you saw was ribs, everywhere, I mean everywhere...' Mr Arredondo said afterwards.

'The device, the IED, went down and then it went up.'

Mr Arredondo immediately sprinted into action after the bombs detonated, 
and he can be seen in a series of photos and videos of the aftermath rushing to one of the two 
bombing sites, then pulling debris and fencing away from the bloody 
victims, clearing the way for emergency personnel to tend to their 
wounds.

Bauman, from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, had been watching his 
girlfriend compete in the race when the devastating blast went off, 
changing his life forever.
