Payout: Soazig Parassols was late to work on six occasions as a result of train delays caused by SNCF

A French train commuter has won 1,500 euros in compensation after repeated rail delays saw her lose her job for arriving late to work.

Soazig Parassols worked as a secretary for a law firm in Lyon, but was fired after just a month because she repeatedly turned up late.

But Ms Parassols, 25, was awarded compensation after arguing that her trains from Amberieu in eastern France, were delayed at least six times.

During her month-long trial at the Lyon law firm the train she caught to work was delayed by anything from 10 to 75 minutes.

The law firm where she was on trial in June 2010 said that her frequent lateness was damaging to the running of the company.

A court in France has now ordered French rail company SNCF to pay Ms Parassols 1,500 euros (£1,250) in compensation.

She had originally asked for 45,000 euros (£37,500), but the court did not award her this as they ruled that she had not suffered financial loss.

The court did find, however, that the six delays to her work commute also caused Ms Parassols stress.

Ms Parassols was also awarded 1,500 euros in legal costs.

French national rail firm were told to pay out 1,500 euros, while Ms Parassols also won 1,500 euros in legal costs
