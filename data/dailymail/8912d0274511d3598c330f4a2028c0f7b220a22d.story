A woman was dragged along her driveway by five bears after catching them digging through her garbage bins in her garage.

The 45-year-old was mauled and clawed but managed to escape and ran back inside her house to her husband.

They called 911 and she was taken to hospital with wounds to her head, face, legs and torso.

The attack in Lake Mary, Florida happened just 10 miles from another bear mauling where a woman was jumped upon whilst walking her dogs home.

Wildlife officials said that at this time of year bears were more likely to be scavenging for food and that residents should be on the lookout.

In the latest incident, Seminole County Sheriff Lt. Pete Brenenstuhl said that the woman, who has not been identified, was set upon by five bears ‘of various sizes’, suggesting it was a family of the animals.

He said the bears pounced on her the moment they saw her and ‘dragged her from inside the garage out into her driveway’.

The woman was taken to South Seminole Hospital in Longwood for treatment.

Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission confirmed that it was investigating.

Dave Telesco, the head of the wildlife commission's bear management program, said: ‘Now is the time to expect bears to show up looking for food.

‘If they can't find food in your neighborhood, they'll move on.’

In December Susan Chalfant suffered serious head injuries after a bear ‘came out of nowhere’ and jumped on her as she walked with her dogs in Longwood.

Deadly: The woman was lucky to survive the attack and fled inside to get help from her husband

It was the worst bear attack ever recorded in Florida and left the 54-year-old covered in blood and with facial injuries that were so bad a neighbour hardly recognised her.

She later told wildlife investigators: ‘That bear was trying to kill me. It just kept coming’.

In January two Scottish tourists were attacked by a bear whilst on holiday in California after they walked straight past the animal oblivious to its presence.

Bob and Irene McKeown did not see the black bear as they exited their daughter’s house even though it was just 10ft away from them.

It followed them to their car where it clawed Mr McKeown who had just put his wife in the vehicle.

Wildlife officials said that the animal could have been looking for food.

Urban sprawl has meant that towns are taking up ever more of the land where bears live - and their numbers are increasing too.

In the 1970s an estimated 300 wild black bears were in Florida but that number stood at 3,000 in 2002, the most recent survey.

Researchers believe there could be as many as 5,000 now.
