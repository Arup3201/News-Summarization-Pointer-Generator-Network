The Duke of York was drawn into the royal lobbying row last night after it emerged he has held 11 private meetings with Cabinet ministers since the  general election.

Over the past three years, he has invited a string of senior politicians such as Chancellor George Osborne, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Education Secretary Michael Gove for audiences at Buckingham Palace.

He met Foreign Secretary William Hague twice and also held two meetings with Andrew Mitchell when he was International Development Secretary.

Prince Andrew met Chris Huhne when he was Energy Secretary. He has also met two Northern Ireland Secretaries, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, and met Mr Paterson again when he became Environment Secretary. He even called Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Britain’s most senior civil servant, into the Palace for a summit.

The archives of the Court Circular reveal that the Prince’s meetings with senior figures continued even after he stepped down from his controversial official role as the UK’s Special Representative for International Trade and Investment.

He was forced into a humiliating resignation from the position in mid-2011 following criticism for his perceived closeness to unsavoury regimes such as that in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. During his ten-year tenure he attracted the nickname ‘Airmiles Andy’.

Details of the Duke’s high-level summits 
comes a day after the Daily Mail revealed that Prince Charles has held 
36 private meetings with Cabinet ministers since the election – one a 
month. While Clarence House insisted that the meetings were to prepare 
him for his future role as head of state, critics accused Charles of an 
‘incontinence of lobbying’ because many of the audiences were with 
ministers covering pet issues such as climate change, alternative 
medicine and architecture.

Last night, Labour MP Paul Flynn asked why Prince Andrew needed to hold private meetings with busy ministers, when he no longer held any official role.

‘What is he talking to William Hague about?’ he asked. ‘The Duke of York has been cosy with some pretty odious regimes in the past. We want lobbyists to declare who they are seeing, and the same should be true of the Royal Family.’

But a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘The Duke meets a vast range of people in connection with his work including, on occasions, government ministers. Like all official engagements, these meetings are recorded in the Court Circular.’
