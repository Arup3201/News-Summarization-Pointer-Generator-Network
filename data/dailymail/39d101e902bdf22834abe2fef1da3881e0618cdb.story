A 20-year-old man has been stabbed to death on a Luton estate where earlier this month police
were forced to begin armed patrols in a bid to clamp down on gang shootings.

The victim, who has been named by 
residents as Jordan McGuire, was fatally injured in the terraced home 
he shares with his mother on the troubled Marsh Farm estate, which has now seen three murders and 11 shootings since September.

An ambulance crew and armed police rushed to Thrales Close at around 8.15pm on Sunday where he was was found bleeding heavily.

His mother Julie and his sister, who 
lives locally, looked on as paramedics tended to Jordan. He was taken to
the Luton and Dunstable hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly 
after his admission.

Detectives said they were keeping an 
open mind about the motive for the murder, but residents believe it is 
the latest attack in the gang war between youths from the Marsh Farm and
Lewsey Farm Estates in Luton.

Three people have been murdered since September and there have been 11 shootings since the beginning of the year.

DCI Stephen Collin, of the Beds, Herts and Cambridgeshire Major Crime Unit, is appealing for information.

He said: 'There are three key persons of interest we are seeking in the inquiry.

They have been caught on CCTV. They 
are a black male on a bike, a black male with a dog and white female, 
probably a teenager with red dyed hair in a pony tail.

It is really important that they come forward or people on Marsh Farm provide information on who they are.

'The victim would have known who his attacker or attackers were. It was a targeted attack.'

A post mortem is to be carried out later today.

Yesterday the area around the 3 bed 
terraced house was taped off as forensic officers examined the scene. 
The car park at the back of the house, which was strewn with beer and 
spirit bottles, was also cordoned off.

Resident Chris Martin, 58, said: 
'Jordan was a nice lad who got on well with people. When it happened all
his mates went up to the hospital. His mum and his sister were out 
there as the ambulance crews treated him.

'From what I understand he was 
stabbed in the side by someone who just walked past. I have no idea what
it was about. There has been all this trouble between a gang on the 
estate and Lewsey Farm.'

Jordan's father, who is believed to 
live in Stevenage, was at the scene after the killing. Family liaison 
officers from the police were supporting the family.

Another local said: 'The ambulance 
crew were working on him at the back of the house and then he was taken 
to hospital. We heard he had been stabbed in the neck.'

On May 11 a 16 year old was shot in the back in the neighbouring Thricknells Close. Police said he may never walk again.

In the past year there has been 
violence in Luton involving rival gangs from the Marsh Farm and Lewsey 
Farm Estates. Earlier this month Kyle Beckford, 22, a member of the 
Marsh Farm gang, was jailed for a minimum of 24 years from the murder of
Delaney Brown, 19, who was run over while on a push bike last 
September. Delaney was in the Lewsey Farm gang.

On 12 April Delaney's uncle Paul Foster, 46, who was known as Big Shyne, was shot dead outside a house in Brunel Road.

This weekend a man from Luton was 
charged with attempted murder and possessing a gun after shots were 
fired at a BMW by a man riding a motorbike in Culverhouse Road on 5 May 
after a peace rally in the town. Khadeem Newell, 22, of Jasmine Road, 
Luton, appeared before magistrates and was remanded in custody.

A woman who lives nearby said: 'I am 75 years old. I live here on my own. It is frightening. There is too much of it going on.'

Another man said: 'This is a disease 
spreading across the estate. It is a drug turf war. They are silly young
lads with nothing to do. It is the Marsh Farm and Lewsey Farm gangs. 
They have got to stop messing around with knives and guns.'

In recent weeks armed officers 
carrying Heckler and Koch G36C assault rifles with 5.56mm calibre 
ammunition that can pierce body armour, have been seen on patrol.

The high-powered weapons were introduced in response to 
the threat of a ‘marauding’ terror attack, like the one in Mumbai 
involving a gang of men with semi-automatic rifles.

Bedfordshire Police have also invoked
Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, allowing 
them to stop and search without suspicion.
