A jilted lover who died after setting himself and his ex’s house on fire had desperately tried to rekindle his relationship with his former partner just hours earlier.

David Potts had begged Tracy Jones to take him back via Facebook before the fire left her and her three children critically injured.

The 39-year-old left a Facebook message for Miss Jones at 1am on Monday, saying: ‘I used to be happy but now I am sad. I used to laugh, now I cry.

‘I used to be someone, now I am no one’, he added just four hours before going to her home in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, where they allegedly had an argument, the Daily Mirror reported.

After the row, he is said to have poured petrol over his body and screamed: ‘If I can’t have you, no one will’, and lit a match.

The former couple are said to have 
had a one-year on-off relationship, which began when his teenage son 
Nathan started dated her 18-year-old daughter Cailin.

Potts and Jones’s relationship was 
apparently ‘stormy’ and police had reportedly been called to the house on 
several occasions.

Potts is also said to have fallen out
with Jones’s 15-year-old son Shaun last October and wrote him a message
saying: 'Please read this before telling me to f*** off… I am sorry 
for what happened.’

He then wrote on Facebook afterwards: ‘Why is life so hard – you can’t live with them but you can’t live without them.’

After getting back together briefly, 
Potts and Jones split again in August and he posted on Facebook one 
month ago: ‘My life is s***. Lost my girlfriend and her kids.’

He added the following day: ‘Anyone with me to get my life back. Had it taken away, going to fight for it.’

The Independent Police Complaints 
Commission is investigating how the 999 calls from Tracy’s family were 
handled last month before the fire.

Fighting for their lives: Tracy Jones, left, and her daughter Cailin. Ms Jones's former lover is believed to have doused himself with petrol and turned himself into a human torch at their home

In hospital: Two of Tracy Jones's children Zach, four, and Cailin. Cailin, 18, tried to put out the fire as it ripped through their home

Tracy and her three children, who moved to the UK from South Africa ten years ago, are currently critically ill in hospital from the fire.

Potts was taken to hospital suffering from severe burns but died a 
short time after the blaze started, at around 4.50am on Monday.

A Home Office post-mortem examination found that he died from fire-related injuries..

Devastated neighbours said they heard shouting and a disturbance at the address before it went up in flames.

Tracy and eldest daughter Cailin, 18, tried to 
put out the fire but the blaze ripped through the ground floor of the 
family’s £120,000 semi-detached house.

Firefighters stormed inside the property and carried out Tracy's sons Shaun, 15, pictured, and Zach, aged four, who had been asleep in bed

the house after college student Cailin staggered outside and cried for 
help.

Firefighters stormed inside the property and carried out Tracy’s 
sons Shaun, 15, and Zach, aged four who had been asleep in bed.

The
tragedy occurred at 5am Monday morning after Mr Potts and Ms Jones 
were believed to have been talking in the living room when suddenly fire
broke out.

Police have confirmed there was 
contact with Ms Jones, believed to be over unwanted attention from Mr 
Potts, within the past month.

Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts, 
Trafford divisional commander for Greater Manchester Police, said:
'There is speculation in the media that David has gone to the house and
started the fire.

'While this is clearly a line of inquiry we are investigating, until we 
have established the exact circumstances surrounding the fire, it would 
not be appropriate for us to speculate further.

'However, at this time, we are not looking for anyone further in relation to this incident.

'A dedicated team of detectives is working closely with the fire service to establish how this fire started.

'This is an extremely serious and tragic case, which has left one person
dead and four others critically injured. Our thoughts are with the 
families of all of those involved.

'We are asking for people in the local community to come forward and 
speak to police if they have any information that may help us with our 
investigation.'

A force spokesman said that, within the last month, police had had contact with the injured woman.

Due to the previous contact, GMP's Professional Standards Branch has 
voluntarily referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission.

Neighbour Kevin Pearce, 41, a supermarket worker said: 'I woke up from hearing screaming and smashing glass.

'I looked out my bedroom window, saw 
smoke and I told my partner to call the fire brigade. I dashed out of 
the house as fast as I could and I could see the daughter was already on
the grass outside.

'The 
front door was locked but the downstairs window was open and I managed 
to pull the window off the hinges. I could see Tracy and I managed to 
tug her through the window frame.

Fire, police and forensic officers search for clues following the blaze in the early hours of Monday

'She was conscious but in obvious 
shock and was screaming and hysterical. I wasn’t thinking anything about
my own safety - it was pure adrenaline was driving me to get her out.

'I
got the mum out and ran around the back and that’s where the older son 
was, but that was locked, so I pulled the back window off but the smoke 
was too much.

'Then the 
emergency services came and I told them that someone was in the kitchen 
and the little lad was upstairs in his bedroom.

It’s such a tragedy. This is a quiet neighbourhood and they were a lovely family who always said hello.'

Anyone with information is asked to call Trafford CID on 0161 856 8314 
or by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 
555 111.
