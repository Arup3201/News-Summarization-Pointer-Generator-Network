A British ice-cream maker has invented a dessert which can help with erectile dysfunction - by flavouring the batch with Viagra.

The Arousal flavour contains around 25mg of Viagra per scoop. It was created on specific request from a celebrity customer of South Wales ice cream company, Lick Me I’m Delicious.

Inventor Charlie Harry Francis added the Viagra to the ice cream and used champagne for flavour to complete the bespoke recipe.

Viagra is available in 25 milligrams, 50 milligrams, and 100 milligrams. For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 milligrams.

Mr Francis says he was approached by an ‘A-list celebrity’ to create the very specific flavour for a party, and spent a few days perfecting the recipe.

He said: ‘It's all very secretive. We had to sign a confidentiality agreement so I can't reveal the name of the client.

‘All I'm allowed to say is it was for a party and that they were very happy with the end result and that I made “the required amount”.'

Double up: The recommended dose of Viagra is 50mg - or two scoops of the ice cream

‘Because it was for a celebrity they're being cagey about what I can say about it.’

Mr Francis, who last year succeeded in making the world’s first glow in the dark ice cream using Jellyfish luminescence protein, says that although creating the ice cream was great fun, sourcing the Viagra was ‘embarrassing’.

His team is currently working on creating the world's first flammable ice cream.

This is not the first time Viagra ice cream has made headlines, London-based The Icecreamists, famous for their Lady Gaga breast milk ice cream, have long been serving their Sex Bomb flavour, which uses a herbal erectile stimulant.
