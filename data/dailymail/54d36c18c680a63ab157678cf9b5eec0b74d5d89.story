The US ambassador to the United Nations has slammed the level of international support for countries hit by Ebola - claiming the response needs to go to 'a wholly different scale'. 

Samantha Power, a member of President Barack Obama's
cabinet, left Washington on Saturday bound for Guinea, Liberia
and Sierra Leone.

Beginning her tour of the west African countries she stated today that too many leaders were praising the efforts of others while doing little themselves.

Speaking to NBC she said: 'You have countries at the United Nations where I work every day who are signing on to resolutions and praising the good work that the United States and the United Kingdom and others are doing. 

'But they themselves haven't taken the responsibility yet to send docs, to send beds, to send the reasonable amount of money.'

Last week, she claimed   the international community 'isn't just losing the race to Ebola - we are getting lapped'. 

But today she added that the 'mere fact of going as a member of the president's cabinet [shows] that we shouldn't be afraid'.

Her message was clear: 'We need to be part of the solution and not run away from something, because it'll come to us if we don't deal with it at its source.' 

She also stressed how health workers should be 'praised as heroes' and not stigmatized when they return home.

Her comments come as three US states mandated widely-criticised quarantine laws for health workers returning from the Ebola-stricken region. 

Obama has resisted Republican calls for a
travel ban to affected countries on advice from health officials who say such a
measure would be counter-productive.  

Along with New York and New Jersey, Illinois has now imposed quarantines for anyone arriving with a risk of having contracted Ebola in West Africa.

But the first person isolated under the
new rules called her treatment a 'frenzy of disorganization.' 

Kaci Hickox, a nurse returning from Sierra Leone, arrived at
Newark airport on Friday and was questioned by protective-gear
clad officials amid what she said was a mis-diagnosis of fever,
followed by a transfer to a hospital isolation tent.

Hickox said she feared for what lies ahead for other U.S.
health workers trying to help combat the epidemic that has
killed thousands in West Africa. 

'Will they be made to feel like criminals and prisoners?' she wrote in an article published on Saturday by The Dallas
Morning News on its website.

'I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a
frenzy of disorganization, fear and, most frightening,
quarantine,' wrote Hickox, of charity Doctors Without Borders. 

More than 10,000 people have contracted the Ebola virus, with 4,922 deaths, according to the World Health Organization's most recent figures.

All but 27 of the cases have occurred inside Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. 

New York and New Jersey imposed 21-day quarantines after a
New York City doctor was diagnosed with the disease on Thursday,
days after returning home from working with patients in Guinea.

The doctor's case and the fact he was out and about in the
city in the period before his symptoms emerged set off renewed
worries in the United States about the spread of the disease.

Illinois will now also require a mandatory quarantine of
anyone who has had direct contact with Ebola patients in those
countries.

The quarantines imposed by the three states exceed
current U.S. government guidelines, although the Obama
administration is discussing similar measures.

Ebola, spread through direct contact with bodily fluids from
an infected person, is not transmitted by people who are not
showing symptoms. 

Hickox's account of her treatment echoed concerns of critics
of the mandatory quarantines who say they could discourage
Americans from going to help control the epidemic.

Ebola has killed almost half of more than 10,000 people
diagnosed with the disease - predominantly in Liberia, Sierra
Leone and Guinea - although the true toll is far higher,
according to the World Health Organization.

Doctors Without Borders has criticized Hickox's treatment.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, asked by reporters about the
nurse's complaints, said his first obligation was the safety of
the people of New Jersey.

'Inconvenience that could occur from having folks that are
symptomatic and ill out amongst the public is a much, much
greater concern of mine,' he said.
