Brendan Rodgers doesn’t deserve the blame for Liverpool’s poor start to the season, according to former Reds star Steve McManaman.

Despite earning three points against Stoke on Saturday, thanks to a late Glen Johnson goal, Liverpool, who finished second last season, are in the bottom half of the table.

But McManaman thinks Rodgers, and his much-criticised signings, who have failed to make the desired impact, deserve more time.

‘I don’t blame Rodgers to be honest,’ said McManaman, who spent a decade at Liverpool before joining Real Madrid in 1999, and will be watching their next game, against Leicester on Tuesday night, as a BT Sport pundit.

‘Last year, when the team was excellent, we didn’t really focus on Brendan, we focused on how well the team were playing.

‘The fact that the team are struggling this year, people are saying it’s all about Brendan – but I don’t think so.

‘The majority of the players who played last year are playing this year. Players who were excellent last year probably haven’t reached that level yet.

‘He’s brought new signings in to galvanise the team, a lot of the new signings haven’t worked yet.But a lot of those new signings are younger players that deserve a little bit more time.’

And McManaman says that if Liverpool can build on Saturday’s win and pick up some momentum, they can still finish in the Premier League’s top four.

‘I still think the Champions League is an opportunity.

‘Apart from Manchester City and Chelsea, the likes of Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester United, Everton, the teams that occupied those type of places last year alongside Liverpool, they’re fairly inconsistent as well.

‘So I think if anybody makes a really good run of games, and wins games on the bounce out of those teams, they’ve got an excellent chance of getting into the Champions League spots.’

For that to happen, Liverpool need to rediscover the form that saw them score over 100 goals int he league last season.

Having lost Luis Suarez to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge to injury, the goals have dried up, but McManaman believes striker Rickie Lambert should be given an extended run in the Liverpool team.

Lambert has scored just one Premier League goal since his summer move from Southampton, but has impressed in his last few games, scoring against Crystal Palace and Ludogorets before providing for Glen Johnson to score Liverpool’s winner against Stoke.

‘I think Rickie Lambert needs to play,’ said McManaman. ‘I think he needs to play games, he needs to stay in the team, he needs to know that he’s going to be playing and he needs to build on a bit of form that he’s got.

‘He’s done well recently, he’s been involved in goals and he’s scored goals, he was involved in the goal on Saturday, so I think injuries permitting he should start tomorrow.’

Lambert should get a run in the first team with Balotelli and Sturridge injured says McManaman

However, despite travelling to bottom of the table Leicester, Liverpool should not expect everything their own way on Tuesday night.

Nigel Pearson’s side scored five times when they beat Manchester United at the King Power stadium, and have also earned impressive draws with Arsenal and Everton.

And McManaman believes Liverpool could be in for a shock if they underestimate their opponents.

‘I’d have thought they’ll raise their game, like they did against Manchester United.

The Premier League's bottom side have not won since beating United, but could raise their game on Tuesday

‘I think the place, no disrespect to if they were playing Burnley at the King Power, but I think when Liverpool or Manchester United or Chelsea come around, the place will be absolutely rocking tomorrow night.

‘It’s going to be a cold Tuesday night, Liverpool will have played a lot of games in the last ten games, there’s a really good chance for them tomorrow to get at Liverpool, and I bet you that’s what Nigel Pearson will be saying to them.'
