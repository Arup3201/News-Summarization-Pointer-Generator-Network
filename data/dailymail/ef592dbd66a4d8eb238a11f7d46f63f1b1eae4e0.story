The US military is hoping to develop hawk-like drones that can not only scan dangerous locations from the air, but also fly through buildings.

It hopes its new generation of drones will be able to fly up to 45 miles per hour (20 metres per second) while navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces.

And, the military wants the drones to be able to do this without any communication from outside operators, and without relying on GPS.

The drones are being developed as part of its Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) program, which is currently writing the algorithms to improve their navigation.

According to Darpa, these drones could help military teams patrol dangerous environments, as well as help rescue teams respond to disasters such as earthquakes.

'Birds of prey and flying insects exhibit the kinds of capabilities we want for small UAVs,' said Mark Micire, Darpa program manager.

'Goshawks, for example, can fly very fast through a dense forest without smacking into a tree. Many insects, too, can dart and hover with incredible speed and precision.

'The goal of the FLA program is to explore non-traditional perception and autonomy methods that would give small UAVs the capacity to perform in a similar way, including an ability to easily navigate tight spaces at high speed and quickly recognise if it had already been in a room before.'

If successful, the algorithms developed in the program could improve unmanned system capabilities by reducing the amount of processing power, communications, and human intervention needed.

The initial focus is on UAVs, but advances made through the FLA program could potentially be applied to ground, marine and underwater systems,

This could be especially useful in environments where GPS can't be used.

'Urban and disaster relief operations would be obvious key beneficiaries, but applications for this technology could extend to a wide variety of missions using small and large unmanned systems linked together with manned platforms as a system of systems,' said Stefanie Tompkins, director of Darpa's Defense Sciences Office.

'By enabling unmanned systems to learn 'muscle memory' and perception for basic tasks like avoiding obstacles, it would relieve overload and stress on human operators so they can focus on supervising the systems and executing the larger mission.'

As well as developing the algorithms for these drones, the US Army is already testing designs.

They have even built a pair of tiny robo-wings just 0.1-inches (3mm) long.

It is a battle to send a drone supersonic - and pits China against Britain.

Experts have claimed China's drone, called Dark Sword, is under secret development.

It was unveiled in 2006 at an airshow, but has since disappeared from public view. however, it has now reappeared in a report on the the website of the country's national broadcaster CCTV.

The Dark Sword - known in Chinese as 'Anjian' -made its debut at the Zhuhai Airshow in southern China's Guangdong province. The model was subsequently exhibited at the Paris Air Show - but was then never heard of again.

Some claim the project has already been scrapped due to insufficient funding or other reasons, while others believe the development of the drone is now being kept secret as it is undergoing further research and testing.

Chinese aviation expert Fu Qianshao told CCTV that while he does not know the status of the Dark Sword project, the drone could become the world's first supersonic UAV if it proves a success.

Dr Ron Polcawich and his team at the Army Research Laboratory, known as ARL, in Adelphi, Maryland, said their wings can already fly.

'We demonstrated that we can actually create lift,' he said. 

'So we know this structure has the potential to fly.' 

The wings are made of lead zirconium titanate, referred to as PZT.

This material creates electric charge under an applied pressure or can create strain - such as motion - under an applied voltage, or electric field.

They bend and flap when voltage is applied to the PZT material.

The team have also designed sets of tiny robotic legs for a millipede-like robot that simulate crawling when voltage is applied to the PZT material. 

While the legs and wings are currently functional, Dr Polcawich said it may take another 10 to 15 years of research and development to actually produce fully-functional robotic insects.

For instance, algorithms are needed to simulate how a flying insect stabilises itself, he said.

Creating this type of artificial intelligence or 'cognitive ability' will take time, explained Dr Polcawich.

Dr Joseph Conroy, an electronics engineer at the US Army Research Laboratory, part of the Research, Development and Engineering Command, works with robotic systems that can navigate by using senses inspired by insects. 

A recently developed prototype, capable of wide-field vision, is something researchers hope to test at the manned and unmanned teaming, or MUM-T exercise at the Maneuver Center of Excellence, Fort Benning, Georgia.

This project will give us a chance to implement methods of perception such as 3D mapping and motion estimation on a robotics platform, Dr Conroy said. 

'The upcoming tests are a small example of a much larger effort,' added Brett Piekarski, collaborative alliance manager.

'The university researchers across the consortium work with the Army researchers to come up with systems that can provide Soldier/robot teaming and be transitioned to industry.'

The prototype is designed to help soldiers have tactical awareness at squad, and personal level, in a variety of environments. 

'If our prototype operates in the way it was designed to during these tests, it would be a technical win,' Dr Conroy said. 

'But I would say the real goal of this exercise is to put the technology in the hands of soldiers, gather their feedback, and gain understanding about what will make autonomous systems more useful.'
