More than 500 disabled people are starting jobs every week, according to the Government.

The move into employment will mean an end to out-of-work benefits for most and a boost to the Coalition’s drive to cut the welfare bill.

However, while they may no longer receive payments such as Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment Support Allowance or Incapacity Benefit – they could still qualify for the Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments, which take into account the higher costs many disabled people face in everyday life.

The crackdown on sickness benefits has been criticised by disability campaigners, who have accused the Government of doing little to help claimants into work.

Disabled people are still far  more likely to be unemployed than others of working age. In 2012,  only 46.3 per cent of working-age disabled people were in jobs compared to 76.4 per cent of non-disabled people.

But the Department for Work and Pensions has pointed to grants, mentors and job placement schemes it has established to help those with disabilities.

Ministers want to tackle the negative attitudes of some employers who wrongly believe that hiring someone with disabilities would be too complicated.

The Government this month launched its disability employment strategy to look at what else can be done for both employers and those with disabilities to get more people into work.

More than 78,000 disabled people have been helped into jobs through such schemes since 2011.

Mike Penning, minister for disabled people, said: ‘This Government is determined to boost the employment rate for disabled people and is helping more and more people with a disability into work. Our measures are working to help people fulfil their potential.

‘Our Disability Confident campaign is backed by the country’s biggest businesses and has started touring the country to showcase the impressive talents of Britain’s 6.9million disabled people.

‘People with disabilities account for a fifth of the workforce and are tremendously valuable to the British economy – helping us compete in the global race.’

A further 6,000 people with disabilities have set up their own businesses through a new enterprise allowance, with access to mentors and start-up grants.

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of easyJet, said: ‘Already over 100,000 disabled entrepreneurs employ an equivalent number of people in their business start-ups.

'This highlights the extraordinary strength of the entrepreneurial flair and talent amongst the disabled people of this country.’
