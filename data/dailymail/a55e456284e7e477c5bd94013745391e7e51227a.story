The White House plans to defy Congress and permanently shutter the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, setting the stage for an epic throw-down on Capitol Hill over the future home of 149 terrorists – including some of the most dangerous individuals the U.S. has ever captured.

Barack Obama signed an executive order on the first day of his presidency declaring his intention to close down 'Gitmo,' as it's called in Pentagon circles, and send its population of war-on-terror captives to domestic prisons or repatriate them.

Both Congress and the American public strongly oppose the plan. House Speaker John Boehner told MailOnline in a statement that 'even as Islamic jihadists are beheading Americans, the White House is so eager to bring these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the United States that it is examining ways to thwart Congress and unilaterally re-write the law.'

Former President George W. Bush declined comment through a spokesman. 

But a Kansas Republican lawmaker – facing the possibility of seeing Obama transfer Guantanamo's inmates to his state's Leavenworth maximum security prison – pledged Friday during a campaign event that 'if he tries it ... I will shut down the Senate!'

To close or not to close? The most hardened anti-American terrorists are housed at Gitmo, but President Obama wants to close it and transfer every detainee either to U.S. prisons or back to their countries of origin

Tough choice: Obama campaigned on a promise to close Guantanamo by the beginning of 2010, and his post-presidential legacy is beginning to weigh on him

Sen. Pat Roberts is in the political fight of his life and needs to create headlines, but Obama faces real hurdles: how to accomplish what Congress has made illegal, with money it has forbidden him to spend, and where to put the orange-jumpsuited prisoners who call Gitmo home.

'Not only is this scheme dangerous,' Boehner said, 'it is yet another example of what will be this administration’s legacy of lawlessness.'

Gallup polled Americans in June after Obama swapped five Taliban prisoners for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdal, who reportedly deserted his unit in Afghanistan before being captured.

Just 29 per cent supported closing Guantanamo, and 66 per cent were opposed.

It's clear that there's nothing resembling serious support for the idea on Capitol Hill. In May 2009, with both houses of Congress in Democratic hands, the Senate voter 90–6 against adding $80 million to the U.S. defense budget that Obama had requested to pay for his plan.

'The American people don’t want these men walking the streets of America’s neighborhoods,' South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune said at the time. 

'The American people don’t want these detainees held at a military base or federal prison in their back yard, either.'

Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe told MailOnline on Friday that Obama's zeal to close Gitmo for political gain 'is exceeded only by his willingness to bypass Congress and ignore the law in order to accomplish it.'

'With the threat of terrorism on the rise, the president should be focusing on strengthening U.S. national security,' Inhofe said, 'but instead he is attempting to check boxes before the midterm elections.'

The Wall Street Journal noted Friday that most of the facility's prisoners – there were 800 enemy combatants there at one point – were released before Obama took office.

But those who remain are a boiled-down worst-of-the-worst, the most hardened terrorists the U.S. has ever put in handcuffs.

Gloves off: House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, blasted Obama's Gitmo plan as part of a 'legacy of lawlessness'

At what cost? Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was freed from captivity in May after Obama traded him for five hardened Taliban fighters

Now former CIA Director James Woolsey says the 'Taliban Five' were released because the White House wants to shrink the Gitmo population to a size where maintaining the prison won't make economic sense

The Journal cited an unnamed senior administration official who said Obama is 'unwavering in his commitment' to closing the prison, and wants options for a coming day when he lays out his presidential legacy.

Congress bans the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. each year when it sends the National Defense Authorization Act to the president for his signature.

Obama would face a firestorm of angry lawmakers if he were to hamstring the Pentagon by vetoing the entire bill over that provision.He would also risk a slap from the Supreme Court, and a relentless public backlash – especially from Americans in states with prisons that could house transferred detainees – if he chose to ignore Congress' restraints and do it anyway.

Worst of the worst, but where to put him? Khalid Sheikh Mohammad was the top organizer of the 9/11 terror attacks

That could come via a 'signing statement,' a controversial self-administered vaccine against Congress that some presidents have used to indicate that they're enacting a law even though they think narrow parts of it are unconstitutional.

Former CIA Director James Woolsey said Friday morning that the president is desperate enough to whittle down Guantanamo's numbers that he seized the opportunity in May to clear out five captives through a prisoner swap while freeing Bergdahl.

'I think the Bergdahl trade ... was about trying to get rid of terrorists that are incarcerated in Gitmo, get them taken by somebody else or freed, so there's less and less pressure on the president to keep Gitmo going,' Woolsey said on the Fox News Channel. 

The numbers suggest Woolsey could be right.

It costs the Pentagon $2.7 million per year to keep each inmate at Gitmo. The comparable annual cost for housing a prisoner at a Supermax prison in the U.S. is just $78,000. 

'As the number becomes smaller at Guantanamo, the case for domestic transfers ... becomes that much stronger,' a senior administration official told the  Journal.

The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found in August that the White House broke federal law by spending nearly $1 million on the Bergdahl prisoner swap despite a congressional ban.

'I think it is dangerous,' Woolsey added. 'And they're down now to 149, I think, prisoners. And most of these, like Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, are really dyed-in-the-wool terrorists.'
