Broni, of Wythenshawe, has been jailed for four years after the Court of Appeal overturned his previous 'unduly lenient' community sentence for having sex with two 15-year-old girls 

A dance coach who was previously spared prison for having sex with two 15-year-old girls has been jailed for four years after a court overturned a judge's decision saying he had 'quite simply got it wrong.'

Jon Broni, 23, of Wythenshawe, 'exploited the infatuation' of two 15-year-olds to have simultaneous sexual relationships with them over a period of six months, and swap naked pictures with each of the girls, the Court of Appeal heard.  

But last year he was spared prison after a judge at Manchester Crown Court found they had given him their 'fulsome consent' and he was instead given a community service sentence. 

Lord Justice Davis, sitting at the Court of Appeal in London, said: 'Girls this age need protection against themselves. So, ostensible consent counts for little or nothing.'

Broni was described at a previous hearing as an up and coming star on Manchester's street dance scene and has mingled with celebrities including Michelle Keegan.

He was handed a community sentence last year after he admitted illicit sexual activity with the two girls. He was also put under supervision for three years and ordered to attend a sex offenders' treatment programme.

But, the 'too soft' sentence was challenged at London's Appeal Court by Solicitor General, Robert Buckland QC.

Three top judges today agreed with him that letting Broni walk free was 'unduly lenient' - and he was instead given a four-year prison sentence.

Broni's victims had become obsessed with the highly-talented street dancer, who ran his own studio in Swinton, Lord Justice Davis said.

He had sex sessions with them both and also swapped naked pictures with the youngsters who were each 'manipulated into sexual activity', added the judge.

Broni's crimes were revealed when one of the girls' mums discovered an incriminating photo on her phone.

He persisted even when friends and colleagues warned him about his behaviour. 

When the teenagers discovered he had been sleeping with them both, he said: 'You can't choose who you fall in love with'. 

Lord Justice Davis, sitting with Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Holgate, said there was an 'element of grooming' in Broni's case, although not as great as in some others.

He added: 'True, he didn't use any force or coercion; that would have been an even more significantly aggravating factor - but he didn't need to.

'They were under his influence and he exploited their infatuation.'

He said Broni should have been sentenced to at least six years in prison and added: 'Bearing in mind all these matters, the court takes the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed is a total of four years'.

Broni was ordered to surrender himself at Swinton police station to begin his sentence.

Charities had previously criticised Broni's 'lenient' sentence after his last appearance at court. 

Broni worked as a street dance coach and Court of Appeal judges said he 'manipulated' the two teenagers 

Yvonne Traynor, chief executive of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre, said: 'This was clearly a case of grooming and rape of young women and the sentence should reflect the seriousness of this heinous crime.'

And Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC's programmes tackling sexual abuse, added: 'It is not possible for someone under 16 to consent to sex legally.

'This law is there to protect children and young people who think they are old enough and believe they are in a loving relationship when actually the older person has taken advantage of them.' 

During the previous hearing Broni was described as a former up-and-coming star in Manchester's street dance scene. He organised much of his own choreography and opened his own Boulevard studios in Salford, Greater Manchester, at the age of 21.
