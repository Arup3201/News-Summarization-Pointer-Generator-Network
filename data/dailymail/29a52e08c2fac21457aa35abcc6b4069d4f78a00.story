Holding it wrong #1: In June 2010, Engadget was given this email, showing Steve Jobs's email to 'Antenna-gate'

Two years ago, iPhone users were frustrated after finding themselves with poor signals on their phone.

Steve Jobs's infamously terse reply to 'Antenna-gate' was, in a direct email to a user, that he was holding his phone wrong.

Now, users of the iPhone 5 are complaining to Apple after finding bright purple flares on their iphone images.

Apple's response? That users are once again holding their phones wrong - and that the purple haze, as seen in the images below, is 'normal behaviour'.

A customer support agent called 
'Debbie' replied: 'Dear Matt, our engineering team just gave me this 
information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the 
bright light source when taking pictures.

'The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera.'

The reply brings back memories of Steve Jobs's infamous reply to an iPhone 4 fan, who complained that his phone would lose signal when held in his hands.

Eventually, Apple backed down and offered users a free 'bumper', which would reduce the signal drop.

Research by tech experts showed that the metal casing worked as a 'Faraday Cage', which reduced the signal, particularly when the phone was also shielded by hand.

Later models incorporated a small gap in the casing, allowing stronger signal strength.

A range of tech forums, include 
XDA-Developers, AnandTech, Apple Forums and many more recount tales of 
the camera's woes, and users have taken to Twitter to show off images 
where the 'purple haze' appears.

It has been speculated that Apple will be able to fix the issue with a software fix.

Many digital cameras and camera 
phones have an element of purple hazing, but it is usually minimised by 
either careful coating of the lens or software tweaks.

Other smartphones in the past, 
including ones from HTC, have also had the problem, but it is usually 
fixed due to software updates.

Users on Twitter have posted a range of images showing the alleged fault with the iPhone 5 camera
