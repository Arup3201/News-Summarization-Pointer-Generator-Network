A Muslim woman who was allowed to wear a full-face veil in court will not have to remove it after she chose not to give evidence yesterday.

Rebekah Dawson, 22, has so far been allowed to appear at her trial for alleged witness intimidation in a niqab showing just her eyes.

Judge Peter Murphy ruled last September that she could wear the Islamic garment in court, but insisted that she would have to let the jury see her face if she chose to give evidence.

Her barrister, Susan Meek, confirmed yesterday at Blackfriars Crown Court that Miss Dawson would not be giving evidence in her own defence – despite being aware that the jury would ‘draw such inferences as might be proper’ from her decision.

Dawson, of Hackney, east London, is on trial alongside her brother, Matthias Dawson, 32, accused of intimidating a security guard at the Finsbury Park mosque in north London last June.

It is alleged they approached Daudi Yusuf at the mosque after an incident between him and Ms Dawson’s husband.

Both defendants deny a single charge of witness intimidation.

Ms Meek, for Rebekah Dawson, told the jury her client's veil had been the 'elephant in the room' during the trial but they should ignore it while deciding on their verdicts.

Summing up Dawson's defence case, Ms Meek said: 'She was given a choice by the judge - she either gave evidence with the niqab off or she remained in the dock with it on. She has remained in the dock.

'You have to try the case on the evidence you have heard in the courtroom without having heard from her.'

She added: 'This is not a trial about the niqab, the niqab is not on trial in this courtroom. This is a woman accused of a criminal offence who happens to wear a niqab.'

Ms Meek said Rebekah Dawson admitted speaking to Mr Yusuf at the mosque on the evening of June 23.

Covered up: Rebekah Dawson has not removed her niqab for any of her court hearings

Judge Peter Murphy told the jury that Rebekah Dawson was 'fully entitled' to dress how she chose to in court

The debate as to whether a burka can be worn in court centers around a conflict between The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and a necessity for jurors to see the face of someone giving evidence.

Article 9 of ECHR gives the defendant a right to manifest her religion or belief.

But in September the judge ruled she must remove the garment if she stood in the witness box.

During case management, the judge gave the following guidance:

-The defendant must comply with all directions given by the Court to enable her to be properly identified at any stage of the proceedings.

-The defendant is free to wear the niqaab during trial, except while giving evidence.

-The defendant may not give evidence wearing the niqaab.

-The defendant may give evidence from behind a screen shielding her from public view, but not from the view of the judge, the jury, and counsel; or by mean of a live TV link.

-[T]hat no drawing, sketch or other image of any kind of the defendant while her face is uncovered be made in court, or disseminated, or published outside court”

Dawson claims they discussed the original row involving her husband, on June 10.

She alleges the original row started when Yusuf asked her to remove her veil at the mosque.

Ms
 Meek said the conversation between Dawson and Yusuf at the mosque on 
June 23 may have been irritating to Mr Yusuf, but it was not 
intimidating.

People in a nearby room were shown on CCTV not being disturbed by any raised voices, the court heard.

'It was not a shouting match, there are no raised voices in any shape or fashion,' she said.

'No one is getting concerned about what is being said.'

The trial will continue tomorrow, when the jury is expected to retire to consider its verdicts.

Earlier in the trial, Judge Murphy told the jury that Dawson was 'fully entitled' to dress how she chose to in court.

He told jurors to put aside any feelings 
they might have about her appearance because they would have nothing to 
do with the case.

Muslim convert Mr Dawson admitted attending the mosque with the hood of his hoodie raised.

But he said he had been there because he had been giving his sister a lift through the area, she had wanted to pray, and he decided to do the same.

He said he heard his sister talking with a man but denied being involved himself.
