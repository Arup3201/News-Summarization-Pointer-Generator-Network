Her erotic fiction has made her millions. And it seems that E. L. James, author of the Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy, has a new passion in her life.

The 52-year-old was spotted driving her £79,000 Tesla Model S electric car during a shopping trip to John Lewis.

Miss James – whose real name is Erika Leonard – swapped her modest Mini for the battery-powered luxury sedan, which boasts a top speed of 150mph and can do 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds.

She and her husband Niall spent an hour treating themselves to some retail therapy at Brent Cross, North London, on Friday afternoon.

And they can well afford it – the former TV executive made £33 million last year, or over £90,500 a day, from sales of the trilogy, which tells the story of sadomasochistic billionaire Christian Grey and his affair with student Anastasia Steele. 

The sum is almost four times more than the reported £8.6 million earned by Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling last year.

The couple, who have two sons, live in a £2.7 million, six-bedroom property in Ealing, West London.

Since the first book’s publication in 2011, the Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and been translated into 52 languages.

The film version, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and starring Jamie Dornan, has taken £365 million since its release last month. As well as topping bestseller lists, the novels have spawned lucrative spin-off products, including two blended wines, Red Satin and White Silk.
