Police hunting for a missing teenager have found a body they believe to be him underneath a railway bridge.

Adam Pickup, 17, from Stockport, was last seen on CCTV on Oxford Street in Manchester city centre at about 3.30am on Saturday.

The teenager, who is the son of a police officer, had been on a night out with friends and left Fab Cafe on Portland Street about 10 minutes earlier.

After his body was apparently found less 
than half a mile from where he was last seen, his 'devastated' family 
took to the internet to express their grief at the news of his death.

Adam's mother Chantal said on Facebook
 yesterday: 'It is with the greatest sadness that we have to tell you 
all that our beloved son Adam was found passed away.

'We are devastated but so grateful to everybody who has helped search for Adam and given us their love and support.'

Her
 comment sparked an incredible outpouring of tributes for Adam, with 
more than 18,000 'likes' on a Facebook page set up in his memory.

Earlier,
 detectives said they could not rule out foul play in Adam's 
disappearance but it was being treated as a missing persons inquiry. 
They now say there were no suspicious circumstances.

Two men from Manchester arrested as part of the police inquiry have now been released without charge.

Greater
 Manchester Police said officers searching for the student found a body 
underneath a rail bridge near Deansgate station at about 3.30pm 
yesterday, after he had been missing for 60 hours.

The
 discovery was made at the same time as the teenager's father Chris, a 
serving GMP officer, was addressing a press conference appealing for 
clues to his son's disappearance.

Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley 
said: 'While formal identification has not taken place, we believe this 
is the body of missing Adam Pickup. His family has been informed.

'This
 is a heartbreaking time for Adam's family and our thoughts are with 
them. Our initial indication is that that there are no suspicious 
circumstances surrounding his death.

'However, speculation as to what may have happened will not give the answers Adam's family is looking for.

'We
 will now carry out a thorough investigation which includes a 
post-mortem examination. We would like to thank the media and the wider 
public for all their support during this appeal, including on social 
media.'

Hundreds of mourners took to Facebook to pay tribute to Adam and try to comfort his grieving family.

Among
 them was Melanie Lawrence, from Manchester, who wrote: 'My thoughts and
 sympathy are with you all at this sad time. No parent should have to go
 through what you are going through. The thoughts of people all over the
 UK are with you.'

Sophia
 Johnson added: 'Such a shame and a waste of such a young life. Though 
gone to a better place, thoughts are with his family and friends at this
 harrowing time.'

Sue 
Lawton said: 'Such a handsome young man. My prayers and thoughts go out 
to his family. His love and zest for life will live on in your hearts. 
Look after each other and keep strong.'

Jake
 wrote: 'Rest in peace Adam, you were truly one of the funniest, nicest 
people to grace this planet and I was fortunate enough to call you my 
friend.'

Adam was described as white, 6ft 2in tall, slim with mousey brown hair. He was wearing a maroon long-sleeved collared shirt, black jeans and black leather Nike trainers with white soles
