With the World Cup countdown under way, there was a moment when Joe Hart squared up to Kevin Nolan after the West Ham midfielder nobbled him with a reckless first-half challenge.

These are the final-day fears for any top player, the injury scares that can ruin the best-laid plans of any England manager.

On Sunday, as Hart kept his 14th clean sheet of another title-winning season for Manchester City, he came through unscathed. Roy Hodgson can breathe a sigh of relief.

Champion: Joe Hart holds aloft the Premier League title after Manchester City beat West Ham 2-0 on Sunday

Injury scare: Hart collides with Kevin Nolan (centre) during their end of season match at the Etihad Stadium

At a Vauxhall car plant in Luton on Monday, City’s first-choice keeper will be named in England’s 23-man squad for Brazil.

Hart will recall that the wheels came off for him earlier in the season, notably in defeats at Aston Villa and Chelsea.

He spent a few weeks in the cooler, taken out of the team after his costly error at Stamford Bridge.

By the time City played their next game, in the Capital One Cup at Newcastle, Costel Pantilimon had taken his place in the team. The fightback began there.

On Sunday, as Hart wrapped up his second Premier League title-winners’ medal, he appeared back to his commanding best. He was submerged by City fans as they raced on to the pitch to salute their heroes and laud Manuel Pellegrini for his first league title. 

As inept and lamentable as West Ham were, Hart was safe and secure in goal. Back in August, Hart began the season with a clean sheet as City beat Newcastle  4-0. On Sunday he finished it with another. He is in good nick, enjoying his football again after that early-season wobble.

Support: Despite his poor form, England boss Roy Hodgson insisted Hart would be his number one choice

This is all good news for Hodgson, who 
backed him throughout his difficult period. Even when Hart was unable to
 force his way back into the City team, Hodgson picked him to start a 
prestige friendly against Germany at Wembley in November.

Hodgson always said Hart would be his first choice at the World Cup and he will be in goal when England face Italy in Manaus on June 14. England - and Hart - could do without City’s trip to Abu Dhabi this week to show off the Premier League trophy and a game against Al Ain.

Hodgson has been assured Hart and James Milner, another England player in decent nick, will be rested from Thursday’s friendly.

They will return at the end of the week before travelling to the Algarve for the start of England’s World Cup preparations.
