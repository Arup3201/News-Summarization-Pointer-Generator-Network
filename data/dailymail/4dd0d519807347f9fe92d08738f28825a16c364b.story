The return of the traditional A-level was heralded yesterday in figures showing a surge in teenagers choosing to study history, geography, languages and maths.

Advance data issued ahead of A-level results next month shows that rising numbers of new entrants to sixth-forms are opting for core academic disciplines.

The number of 17-year-olds taking geography has shot up 17 per cent while demand for history has leapt 14 per cent.

The resurgence of traditional subjects follows the introduction of new-style school league tables aimed at promoting disciplines seen as valuable by universities and employers.

Schools were previously able to score well in the tables without entering pupils for many traditional academic GCSEs, prompting some to favour ‘mickey mouse’ courses to rack up points.

But former education secretary Michael Gove brought in a new ‘English Baccalaureate’ (EBacc) which rewards schools for entering pupils for six core GCSEs - English, maths, two sciences, a language and history or geography.

The impact of the initiative on A-level choices is being seen for the first time, according to figures from the Joint Council for Qualifications, representing exam boards.

The number of pupils taking AS-levels – which are halfway towards a full A-level – in history rose 14 per cent from 71,669 in 2013 to 81,843 this summer, while entrants for AS geography went up 17 per cent to 55,958 and Spanish 15 per cent to 14,089.

Maths saw an increase of 7.1 per cent in entries and physics 4.5 per cent, with smaller rises in French and German.

The JCQ said the trends may be partly down to changes to exams this year including the cancellation of the A-level resit opportunity in January, which is thought to have led to more candidates retaking in June instead.

But it added: ‘Despite this, the dramatic increases in some subjects compared with others point to a large number of candidates sitting the subjects for the first time.’

It went on: ‘Of particular interest in these data is the significant increase in AS entries for geography, history and Spanish (16.9 per cent; 14.2 per cent; 14.8 per cent).

‘French and German entries also increased with French, German and Spanish combined rising 6.1 per cent and all modern foreign languages rising 5.6 per cent.

The number of pupils taking AS-levels – which are halfway towards a full A-level – in history rose 14 per cent from 71,669 in 2013 to 81,843 this summer

‘In fact, AS entries for all EBacc subjects have increased.’

The JCQ said it believed the figures ‘point to the EBacc influencing student and centre [school and college] choices’.

Choices at AS-level usually have a strong bearing on the subjects taken to full A-level, with most pupils carrying on with their AS-level subjects.

Figures for entries to full A-level this summer – before the ‘EBacc effect’ has worked its way through - show modest increases in the numbers taking maths, further maths, chemistry, physics and geography.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said that while the trends were positive, the figures have been rising from a very low base.

In physics, A-level entrants had slumped to 27,368 in 2006 and although demand had now recovered to 36,862, it was still far below levels of 30 years ago.

‘In 1982, there were around 55,700 sitting physics. So although there has been a recovery, it has to be seen against that background,’ he said.

The figures were released amid major changes to the exam system including a crackdown on resits and the return of end-of-course exams.

The exam watchdog Ofqual last month wrote to head teachers warning them of ‘more variability’ in results in 2014 compared with previous years because of this year’s reforms.

Ofqual warned that pupils ‘who have not had the opportunity to re-sit will generally do less well’.

While headline results will be kept broadly in line with previous years, results at individual schools will vary more widely than usual. This year’s results day is Thursday August 14.

Among trends already emerging are a drop in the number of pupils collecting A-level results in English this summer.

Numbers are down 4.4 per cent, from 90,007 in 2013 to 86,036.

It follows a grading fiasco at GCSE level two years ago which stemmed from a redesign of GCSEs by the last Labour administration.

It broke courses down into modules and allowed teachers to mark large chunks of them through so-called ‘controlled assessment’. But over-generous marking by teachers led to grade boundaries in English having to be raised at the last minute.

After a High Court challenge brought by an alliance of pupils, schools and councils, judges ruled that pupils were treated unfairly but that Ofqual and the exam boards did not act unlawfully.

Malcolm Trobe, the deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘There’s quite clearly some indication of an unexpected drop in entries to A-level English, which of course coincides with the issues in 2012 to do with GCSE results in English.

‘It looks as if English entries have gone back up again for AS-level in 2014, which would indicate that there was a drop in those taking English, which would in all probability be linked to what happened in 2012.

‘Although a great deal was made at the time of the effect of the C/D grade boundary, it also impacted across the grade range.’

The figures also showed a decline of 2.4 per cent in the total number of A-levels taken this year despite a small rise in the population of 18-year-olds and an upturn in university applications.

The JCQ said it had so far only analysed ‘high level’ data and could not say whether the trend was down to teenagers opting instead for alternative qualifications such as the International Baccalaureate or simply taking fewer A-levels.
