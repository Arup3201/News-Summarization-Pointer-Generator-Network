Online: Internet retailer Amazon has made £14billion in worldwide sales in just three months - with one tenth of that coming from UK shoppers

Amazon is set to announce record Christmas trading as it continues to ‘lay waste’ to the beleaguered high street.

In just three months the internet store made £14billion in worldwide sales – with one tenth of that from UK shoppers.

But Amazon has been under attack for avoiding millions of pounds in taxes. Critics say this enables the company to slash prices and undercut rivals.

An estimated 17,500 high street jobs are at risk after 1,400 stores closed down over the Christmas period. And industry experts warn more retail failures could see one in five shops boarded up.

Household names including HMV, Jessops, Blockbuster and Comet have all collapsed into administration during the past two months.

Yet Amazon’s expected sales rise is an increase of almost a third compared with 2011.

Waterstone’s founder Tim Waterstone previously said Amazon had a ‘rude, contemptuous, arrogant and subversive’ attitude to competitors.

And John Lewis boss Andy Street has called for a ‘level playing field’ to stop it ‘out-trading’ rivals.

Amazon was also dubbed ‘immoral’ for avoiding tax by funnelling revenue to Luxembourg.

In 2011, the most recent year where figures are available, Amazon paid just £1.8million despite raking in sales of £3.35billion in the UK – a figure the firm tried to keep secret until it was exposed by MPs.

Forecasts from Morgan Stanley, one of Wall Street’s largest banks, show the company is expected to report global sales of more than £14billion between October and December, compared with £10billion the year before.

For the full 12 months Amazon is forecast to have made almost £40billion. That is projected to rise to £86billion in 2015.

‘Amazon is uniquely positioned to be a disruptive force to the traditional retail channel for years to come,’ said analyst RJ Hottovy from US brokers Morningstar.

He added: ‘Amazon has played a prominent role in the structural shift away from bricks-and-mortar retail and it may lay waste to several other retailers in the years to come.

In trouble: HMV, which is currently in administration with some 4,500 jobs at risk, was the latest in a long line of entertainment and electronics stores which have collapsed since the financial crash in 2009

‘Without the cost burden of physical retail stores, Amazon can price below traditional rivals and drive recurring traffic online.’

Since launching, Amazon has expanded from selling books to include DVDs, CDs, household appliances, garden tools and even car parts.

Sales of cheap CDs and DVDs helped hasten the decline of HMV, which is currently in administration with some 4,500 jobs at risk.

The group was the latest in a long line of entertainment and electronics stores which have collapsed since the financial crash in 2009, including Woolworths – once the UK’s biggest seller of DVDs.

A further 4,190 jobs were endangered when video rental service Blockbuster collapsed earlier this month.
