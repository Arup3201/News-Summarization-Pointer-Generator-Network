Bernhard Langer will take an eight-shot lead into the final round of the Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl.

The 56-year-old German began the third round with a seven-stroke advantage over Colin Montgomerie and England's Chris Williams and he tightened his grip with a three-under-par round of 68.

Montgomerie had been hoping to exert some pressure on his former Ryder Cup team-mate but after a three-under-par front nine of 32, he ran into trouble after the turn, carding a double bogey on the 10th followed by a bogey in the 11th, before dropping another shot on the 17th when his tee shot ran into unraked spikemarks in a bunker.

Swing: He is taking part in the Senior Open Championship

Atmospheric: Langer walks up the 18th hole during the third round

That meant a back nine of 40 and a round of 72 for the 2010 Ryder Cup captain, who is now 11 shots adrift of Langer, while Williams also lost ground on the runaway leader with a level par 71 to stay on four under par.

Instead, it was Canada's Rick Gibson, winner of the Bad Ragaz PGA Seniors Open earlier this month, who moved into second place on six under par with a round of 66.

Langer's eight-shot cushion is a new 54-hole record and it is difficult to imagine him not converting that into a second title to go alongside his victory at Carnoustie in 2010.'I am one step closer,' he said 'I still have 18 holes to go. It's nice to have an eight-shot lead but I have still got to keep my head down tomorrow and hit a lot of good golf shots and make some putts and play smart.'
