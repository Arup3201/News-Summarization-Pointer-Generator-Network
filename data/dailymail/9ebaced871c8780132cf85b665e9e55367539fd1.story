Three British grandmothers cheated death when a bullet shot at them by a masked gunman missed by inches.

The armed robber fired from close range when one woman, a grandmother of 14, tried to grab his gun when he ambushed them outside their Spanish holiday home.

One of the women said: 'The bullet was head height and hit a wall behind us. He was less than six feet away when he fired. We came very close to going home in a body bag.'

It is thought the man mistook the trio, all in their 60s, for their friend  who worked at a nearby bar in Malaga and had walked home with the night's takings.

They had spent the evening with her only hours after arriving in Spain for a week's holiday in the village of Alcaucin, Malaga.

A bar owner was shot and killed in nearby Colmar, apparently for drugs money, only an hour after the gunman fled. The dad-of-two's wallet had been stolen and £75 was missing from the bar's till. 

Spaniards Juan Montoya, 38, and Jose Mechine, 44, are being held in custody for the botched armed robbery and the murder of 56-year-old Tarek Nagib Botros. 

One of the trio, who asked not to be named, said: 'I thought at first it was someone playing a game when a man touched my friend on her shoulder and said in Spanish, "Money, money". 

'When I turned round and saw a man with a Balaclava I had this sickening realisation he wasn't playing.

'I began to shout for help, reached for the gun to push it away from us and swore at him. It must have been the adrenalin rush.

'I took a step back when the gun came free and he took a step back and fired. I think it was out of anger at being frustrated by what he'd assumed would be a soft target.

'I had the impression he was aiming at me. The bullet was head height and hit a wall behind us. He was less than six feet away when he fired.' 

'We knew there must be some connection when we heard a man had been shot dead nearby.

'We're just sorry someone had to die.'

The Spanish pair in custody for both incidents used a car that one had bought on deposit from a gypsy in Malaga a few days earlier.

Police suspect the buyer tried to frame him for the double crime by handing him the car back afterwards and telling him to keep the deposit.

The two Spaniards blamed each other for the gun crimes when questioned by police.

An investigating magistrate has remanded them in jail after quizzing them in a private court hearing and is expected to recommend formal charges after a short probe.
