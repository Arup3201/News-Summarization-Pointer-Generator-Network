She is remembered as a sombre figure who was famously ‘not amused’, but as a child Queen Victoria was – by her own admission – ‘horribly naughty’.

The revelation comes in a handwritten ‘behaviour journal’ she kept as a young girl.

The book will go on display to the public for the first time as part of a new exhibition at Buckingham Palace called Royal Childhood, which runs from July 26 until September 28.

A handwritten ‘behaviour journal’ kept by Queen Victoria as a young girl will go on display to the public for the first time as part of a new exhibition at Buckingham Palace. Above left, portrait of the queen as a young child; right, the princess in 1830 - both of which appear at the exhibition

On November 3, 1831, the Princess, then aged 12, described herself in the book as ‘very thoughtless and foolish and impertinent’. The following year she wrote: ‘Very very very very horribly naughty!!!!’

The exhibition, called Royal Childhood, covers more than 250 years of Royal history

Experts believe the behaviour book was used to teach Victoria, who was known as a strong-willed child, some self-control.

The exhibition, which covers more than 250 years of Royal history, will also feature the sailor suit worn by Prince William at the wedding of the Duke of York in 1986, the font used for the christening of Prince George last year, the robe George wore for the ceremony, and a baby rattle that was used by the future King George IV.
