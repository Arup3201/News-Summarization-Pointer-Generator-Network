Two teenagers have been arrested after a 12-year-old boy and woman were left with burns after marine flares were thrown in the middle of an A-league game in Melbourne. 

The incident happened during the second half of Melbourne Victory's clash with Brisbane Roar at Etihad stadium on Friday night. 

Victoria Police say five flares were let off during the second half of the game and they believe young fans are being led astray by older patrons.

The teenagers who have been arrested are assisting police with their inquiries.

North West Metro Commander Rick Nugent said letting off flares was dangerous and illegal and that anti-social behaviour has increased at the soccer this season despite the game's governing body, the league and authorities working tirelessly to improve community safety.

'Flares are extremely dangerous. They can burn at more than 1000 degrees Celsius and are not designed to be released in highly populated areas. 

'They are not easily extinguished, they are designed for marine distress.

'They are not designed for highly populated areas like you have at sporting arenas.

'The increased criminality we are seeing at the soccer this season is completely unacceptable.'

North West Metro Commander Rick Nugent told media on Saturday that letting off flares was dangerous and illegal

Since the first match on October 10 this season, 38 flares have been let off and about 200 chairs broken, he said.

Commander Nugent said most of the 22,000 people attending Friday night's match were well behaved, but a certain group of individuals had other motives.

He said he  believed older patrons could be leading younger supporters astray. 

'Last year we had quite a successful season in terms of significantly reduced anti-social behaviour, violence and criminality at games.

'This year, I suspect part of it is that we have young people joining the active supporter areas that are being led astray by some older and more experienced people and are now embarking upon this sort of conduct.'

The number of flares let off on Friday brings the season's total to 38 compared with eight last season, he said.

Commander Nugent added letting off flares was dangerous and illegal but many people didn't seem to realise how risky it was. 

So far this season, about 30 people have been arrested at Victorian A-League soccer matches.

The first match took place on October 10.
