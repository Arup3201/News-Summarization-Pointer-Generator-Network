Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has had a giggle at Education Minister Christopher Pyne’s expense after Today Show host Karl Stefanovic showed her the Star Wars parody video featuring Pyne’s now infamous ‘I’m a fixer' line.

Stefanovic introduced the clip called 'Star Wars: Fixed', which superimposes Pyne's head onto the body of a imperial officer and blends his recent Sky News interview with a scene from the beloved movie franchise, by asking ‘what’s going on with Christopher Pyne? He’s gone to the dark side, Mr Fix It’.

‘You may not be aware of this but he’s been hired for his specialist skills by an unlikely source,’ Stefanovic joked.

Bishop watched the parody, in which Pyne is heard pledging ‘I’m a fixer, I’ve fixed it in another way which you’ll find out in the budget', on a monitor in Canberra.

Bishop laughed: ‘I wouldn’t be the first person to think that Christopher Pyne comes straight out of a Star Wars movie.’

Today Show host Karl Stefanovic showed Foreign Minister Julie Bishop a parody video starring the Education Minister and her reaction was perfect

‘Well said Minister… may the force be with you,’ Stefanovic responded.

The parody clip, which shows Pyne in connection to the evil Empire's super weapon the Death Star, was first shown on the ABC on Sunday.

Mr Pyne's memorable lines from his recent Sky News interview, where he explained how he had 'fixed' the government's higher education reforms and gave himself the nickname of 'the fixer', are seamlessly inserted into a scene from the iconic movie.

Pyne's confident comments in the Sky interview were ahead of the government's latest attempt to pass higher education reforms, which were later shot down in the Senate for the second time in three months.

In the video, a superimposed Pyne comforts a collection of imperial officers worried about the vulnerability of their planet-destroying space station, as the ruthless, rebel-crushing Darth Vader menacingly stalks around behind him.

The video was created by Huw Parkinson, and aired during ABC's Insiders on Sunday morning.

The spoof, created by ABC producer Huw Parkinson, blends Pyne's cringe-worthy Sky News interview and a scene from the famous trilogy 

Mr Parkinson said he was inspired to make the video after watching Mr Pyne's 'bizarre' interview.

 'His delivery was so theatrical despite the fact he barely moved a muscle though out the entire interview,' Mr Parkinson said.

'I didn't really know how I was going to work it into something but I just knew it was going to work.

'I played around with a few different ideas at first but then once I started toying with this scene from Star Wars it just became clear that this was a perfect match.'

Mr Parkinson also said he was 'working on a few other' videos, but didn't want to spoil the surprise.

'I wouldn't want to promise a video that I can't finish, and there's always the possibility that another classic moment like this Fixer interview will occur in the meantime,' he said.

Labor MP Ed Husic tweeted about his enjoyment of the video, saying it was 'the best thing (he'd) seen' in a long time.

Mr Pyne's office did not have any comment on the video on Sunday morning.

However, the Minister tweeted that he is 'available for Star Wars VII if JJ Abrams wants to know' on Sunday afternoon.
