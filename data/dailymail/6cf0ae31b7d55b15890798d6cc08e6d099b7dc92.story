For years, Google has been driving around the world providing Street View images for people to explore when using Google Maps.

But a new challenger could be on the scene, as cars owned by Apple been spotted with similar camera equipment on their roofs.

While not confirmed, some think it may be that Apple is planning its own rival to Street View - or even testing self-driving car technology.

Scroll down for a video of a similar car spotted last year

A car with cameras on it (shown) was spotted driving around San Francisco. The California DMV confirmed the car was registered to Apple. Some have speculated it could be getting images for a Street View rival

The Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco.

They apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer.

The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years.

Chris Urmson says the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. 

But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly.

He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. 

But a video from last year shows a similar car, which was known to be an unmarked self-driving Dodge caravan.

The latest car seems to have some sort of camera system on the top, somewhat similar to the camera system on top of Google’s Street View car.

It could also be a camera system for a self-driving car.

According to 9to5mac, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple.

With 12 cameras on top of the car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google’s Street View.

‘Too many cameras,’ said technology analyst Rob Enderle, speaking to CBS.

‘It has cameras that are angled down at all four corners of the vehicle.’

Apple ditched Google Maps as the default navigation app on iOS devices in 2012 in favour of Apple Maps. But it has lacked a Street View function since then like Google Maps. Shown is one of their cars in Brooklyn

Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has considerably refined the technology since then (screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London shown)

The would lend itself to the self-driving car theory.

‘Unfortunately for that theory, only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles, and Apple isn’t one of them,’ said 9to5mac.

‘This brings us back to a much more likely conclusion: Apple is preparing to take on Google’s Street View with a similar offering in its own Maps software.’

They said it might features as part of the iOS 9 upgrate due later this year, although it would likely begin only with select cities such as New York and San Francisco.

This would plug a noticeable hole in Apple Maps, which has been sorely missing Street View ever since Apple made it the default maps app for iPhones.

These cars would therefore signify a move to take on Google at their own Street View game.

When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was.

Others have said the vehicle may be testing self-driving technology, again like Google has been doing (Google's self-driving car shown). Apple has so far declined to comment on the appearance of the car
