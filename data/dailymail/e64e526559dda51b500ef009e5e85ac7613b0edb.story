A teenage boy cannot stop growing, shooting up eight inches in just a year, after a tumour the size of a golf ball was removed from his brain.

Keiran Halliday was suffering severe headaches, prompting his GP to refer him to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.

There, doctors discovered the pain was being caused by an unusual growth.

Surgeons operated on the now 19-year-old, removing the tumour.

But Keiran, from Bridgend in South Wales, was then diagnosed with acromegaly - where the body produces too much growth hormone.

Keiran Halliday, 19, from Bridgend, South Wales, was diagnosed with acromegaly - a condition where the body produces too much growth hormone - after having a tumour removed from his brain. He has shot up eight inches in the last year, and now towers above his mother Caroline

Since developing acromegaly Keiran has outgrown most of his clothes and shoes, his mother Caroline said. The condition caused him to put on weight and suffer seizures 

Keiran was suffering severe headaches before his GP referred him to University Hospital of Wales where doctors discovered a tumour the size of a golf ball in his brain

Doctors believe the tumour caused the teenager's body to begin producing excess growth hormone

As a result he has grown eight inches, shooting up from 5ft 6ins to 6ft 2ins in the last year.

This has caused Keiran to suffer seizures and gain weight.

Doctors are unsure whether the teenager will stop growing, despite 12 tablets  and an injection to control his gigantism every day.

His mother Caroline, 54, said Keiran is now unable to go to college or meet up with his friends for fear of suffering a seizure.    

She said: 'He suffered with headaches really badly so we knew there was something not right.

'The next thing we were told he had a tumour in his brain the size of a golf ball - it was a devastating thing to hear.

'I felt like I'd been hit by a steamroller - it was frightening. He had the operation just before Christmas but then we noticed over the next few months that his body was changing dramatically.

'He shot up in height and he put on loads of weight - none of his clothes would fit him so I had to buy him a whole new wardrobe.

Keiran shot up eight inches in a year, from 5ft 6ins to 6ft 2ins, his feet grew from a size six to a nine and he started to gain weight

Keiran's mother Caroline said her son can no longer go to school for fear of suffering seizures, another symptom of his condition

'He was diagnosed with acromegaly earlier this year and doctors have given him 12 different pills to take every day as well as a daily injection to combat the hormones.

'But even now doctors don't know if he'll stop growing or not - it's devastating for Keiran and myself because he just wants to live a normal life like any other teenager.'

Acromegaly is caused by the body producing too much growth hormone.

It results in the growth of body tissues over time.

Typical features include:

The condition affects around six in every 100,000 adults and is extremely rare in childhood.

Acromegaly is often caused by a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour, called an adenoma.

Doctors first spotted Keiran's tumour in September last year but they thought it had burst - meaning Keiran would not need treatment.

But three months later he had to go under the knife to have it removed after doctors discovered it had returned.

However, the tumour had a devastating impact on Keiran as his body started producing too much growth hormones - which also saw his feet grow from a size six to a  nine in less than a year.

The 19-year-old has to have regular blood tests and medication on a daily basis to control the growth hormones.

He said: 'It's been really difficult for me and my mum.

'I can't go out and see my mates because I could have a seizure. 

'I'm on all sorts of medication but even with all of that doctors don't actually know if I'll stop growing or not.

'I wanted to get into media but I can't go to college because of my condition.

'I just hope one day I can get back to normal and carry on with a normal life like I had before.'
