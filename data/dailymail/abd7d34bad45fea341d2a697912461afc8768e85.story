Seven cyber hackers have been charged with stealing $45 million from 27 countries worldwide in one of the world's biggest ever bank heists.

The sophisticated cyber criminals are said to have stolen the cash from thousands of bank automated teller machines in just 10 hours.

They used hacked debit-card data to make 40,500 transactions worldwide, U.S. prosecutors said today.

Authorities said they arrested these seven U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New
 York: Jael Mejia Collado, Joan Luis Minier Lara, Evan Jose 
Peña, Jose Familia Reyes, Elvis Rafael Rodriguez, Emir Yasser Yeje and 
Chung Yu-Holguin.

The eighth defendant charged in the 
indictment, Alberto Yusi Lajud-Peña, also known as 'Prime' and 
'Albertico,' was murdered on April 27 in the Dominican Republic, 
according to prosecutors.

Lynch said it was unclear whether the murder 
was related to the cybercrime case.

Members of the global criminal 
organization hacked into two credit card processors and used stolen data
 to make the withdrawals, during two separate coordinated incidents in 
December 2012 and February 2013, the Justice Department said.

The
 government charged eight individuals in New York with participating in 
the larger scheme by withdrawing $2.8 million in thousands of ATM 
transactions, in what U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said was the 
second-biggest bank robbery in the history of New York City.

Lynch said it was likely that the 
headquarters of the global scheme was located outside the United States 
and that the current charges focused only on the New York-based cell.

Investigators were examining whether other cells were operating elsewhere in the United States, she said.

'In the place of guns and masks, this cyber crime organization used laptops and the Internet.

'Moving
 as swiftly as data over the Internet, the organization worked its way 
from the computer systems of international corporations to the streets 
of New York City, with the defendants fanning out across Manhattan to 
steal millions of dollars from hundreds of ATMs in a matter of hours,' 
said Lynch, whose office in Brooklyn, New York, brought the case.

The case demonstrates the major threat that cyber crime poses to banks around the world.

Security experts frequently identify electronic fraud as one of the key challenges facing banks today.

'Hackers only need to find one 
vulnerability to cause millions of dollars of damage,' said Mark Rasch, a
 former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, based in Bethesda, Maryland.

In
 the December attack, hackers gained access to an Indian credit card 
processor that handled prepaid Mastercard Inc debit cards for National 
Bank of Ras Al Khaimah PSC, or RAKBANK, according to a criminal 
indictment. 

In 
February, the hackers broke into the system of a U.S.-based credit card 
processor to steal account numbers for prepaid Mastercard debit cards 
issued by Bank of Muscat, the indictment said.

The second operation was far larger than the first attack, eventually totaling $40 million in losses to Bank of Muscat.

In
 late February, Bank Muscat disclosed that it would take an impairment 
charge of up to 15 million rials ($39 million) because it had been 
defrauded overseas using 12 prepaid debit cards used for travel.

That charge was equal to more than half of the 25 million rials profit it posted in its first quarter ended March 31.

The indictment does not identify the processor companies.

Bank representatives could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours.

In
 both cases, the hackers boosted the available balance for each card and
 eliminated the withdrawal limits, allowing them to take out huge sums 
of money from ATMs in what prosecutors called an 'unlimited operation.'

A
 single account number, for instance, yielded nearly $9 million in 
profits, including $2.4 million in New York City alone, prosecutors 
said.

The hackers 
distributed the account numbers to coordinated 'casher' crews stationed 
across the globe, who siphoned millions of dollars from ATMs within a 
span of hours in December 2012 and February 2013.

One of the New York defendants was caught in surveillance footage from ATMs in Manhattan during the February operation, prosecutors said.   

After the cards were shut down, cashers laundered the proceeds, often by purchasing luxury goods, and sent a portion of the money back to the organization's leaders, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and bank accounts, as well as two Rolex watches and a Mercedes SUV, from the New York defendants.

No individual bank accounts were compromised by the scheme, Lynch said.

It wasn't immediately known which lawyers were representing the defendants.
