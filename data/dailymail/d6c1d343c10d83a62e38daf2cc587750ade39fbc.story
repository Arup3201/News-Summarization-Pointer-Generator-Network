They've been attracting middle class shoppers with their cheaper food and beauty products, now Aldi want to help families go on holiday for less with the launch of skiwear.

The budget supermarket chain can kit out a family of four to hit the slopes for £154.

The 'Specialbuys' ski range will go on sale in their stores across the UK from Thursday offering ski jackets, salopettes, snowsuits and accessories at a fraction of High Street prices.

Bargain: Aldi are offering softshell ski jackets for adults for £24.99 and salopettes for £16.99

The brand hope the range will appeal to shoppers traditionally priced out of the winter travel market.

But by saving money will consumers sacrifice quality and warmth on the piste?

Not according to John Hill, editor of Britain's biggest ski magazine, Good Ski Guide, who has praised the supermarket for making skiing more accessible to all.

He said: 'Skiing is still seen by many as an exclusive pursuit for 
affluent travellers when it should be a hobby that's available to all to
 enjoy.

Ready for winter: An infant snowsuit from Aldi costs £9.99, left, while children's snow boots are £8.99

Keep warm: Base layers and thermals for men, women and children will be in the collection

'It's fantastic that 
Aldi has launched a range that offers not only great value but is also 
of comparable quality to brands on the High Street.

'I'm sure this will open up the fun, thrill-seeking world of skiing to a whole new audience, of all ages and backgrounds.'

The range includes a softshell ski jackets for adults for £24.99 and salopettes for £16.99.

In comparison, a men's Blade Jacket from ski brand KJus will set you back £1,260 from Snow and Rock.

Meanwhile, an infant snowsuit from Aldi costs £9.99 in comparison to a version at Snow and Rock for £110. They'll also essential skiing accessories including goggles and helmets and additional extras such as two way radio and camcorders at cheap prices.

Top to toe: Audio ear muffs £6.99, left, and girls ski socks come in a two pack for £1.99

Housewife Joanne Clark, 39, from Farnborough, Hants, said going skiing is now a 'real possibility' for her family of four if they can save money on kit.

She said: 'I've never been skiing before but my husband Simon used to when he was younger. We
 had talked of taking our two children and giving it a try, but buying 
or hiring all the kit on top of the cost of the trip held us back.

'Now
 it's a real possibility for us and I’m excited about learning to ski. 
So many people have said how fun it is but it was always out of our 
budget.

Skiwear isn't the only sports clothing the German-owned discounter sells.

They have also had 'specialbuys' of running clothing with trainers for £14.99 and cheap kit for cyclists.

The bid to attract bargain-hunting skiers comes after the store have been luring more middle class shoppers through their doors all year and have started opening stores in affulent areas such as Knutsford in Cheshire.

They keep their costs down by 
stocking their own products over big brands like Hellmann's or 
Kellogg's, and reduce their overheads with minimalist store interiors, 
few staff, and charged-for plastic bags.

Last month retail analysts Kantar said Aldi's total share of the grocery market has gone up from 3 per cent to 3.9 per cent - and in the past 12 weeks, a third of British households have shopped at Aldi.
