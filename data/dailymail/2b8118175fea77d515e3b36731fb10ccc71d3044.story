Channel 4’s Big Fat Quiz has been cleared of wrongdoing despite hundreds of complaints from viewers over obscene jokes about the Queen and singer Susan Boyle.

In a verdict which shocked MPs and campaigners, Ofcom yesterday said it would not investigate the show.

The programme, broadcast on December 30 last year, led to 180 complaints to the media watchdog and a further 150 to Channel 4.

Ofcom started an investigation after Jack Whitehall and James Corden made a raft of vulgar jokes on the broadcast

Comedy
star Jack Whitehall and actor James Corden seemed to be drunk and made 
crude remarks about the Queen, Barack Obama, Usain Bolt and Susan Boyle.

But today Ofcom decided not to launch an investigation into the programme.

Spokesman Rhys Hurd said: 'We assessed the complaints and decided not to investigate for a number of reasons.

'It was a post-watershed programme which started at 9pm and was preceded by a warning of strong language and adult humour.

'We considered that the issues raised
by the complainants did not warrant further investigation because the 
incidence of potentially offensive material was justified by the context
in which it was presented.'

He said the material in a programme of this nature met the expectations of its audience.

He added: 'We took account of the fact that the programme had been broadcast by Channel 4 since 2007.

'It is a well-established programme and known for its incidence of challenging comments and risque humour.'

On New Year's Eve, the day after the 
broadcast, Channel 4 issued a statement saying: 'Big Fat Quiz Of The 
Year is a well-established comedic and satirical review of the year's 
events with well-known guests and was broadcast after the watershed with
appropriate warnings.'

It is believed that Channel 4 received hundreds of complaints over the programme.

Gavin & Stacey star James Corden dismissed his role in the show as 'good fun' after the outcry.

He said : 'It was good fun, wasn't it? It was a laugh and good fun to film.'

Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits
on the House of Commons culture, media and sport committee, said Ofcom should carry out a full review of the show.

He added: ‘Decisions like these start to make the case for an organisation like Ofcom being replaced by an organisation with more gumption and sharper teeth.’

Mark Pritchard, a fellow Tory MP, said: ‘I am disappointed that Ofcom has not taken this issue seriously.

‘These comments caused gross offence and went beyond the realms of decency. I’m surprised Ofcom has decided not to investigate a matter that caused offence to hundreds of people through the country. It needs to be far more robust.’

Ofcom said it was not investigating the show, which was also repeated,  because it aired after the watershed, was preceded with a warning and was in line with ‘audience expectations’ for a satirical show. Channel 4 executives have made no comment.

The Big Fat Quiz of 2012 was far from unusual among programmes billed as 'light entertainment', in the way it revelled in smut and cruel humiliation

Whitehall, who made some of the off-colour jokes, comes from a privileged background.

His father is Michael Whitehall, 72, a former theatrical agent turned producer. His clients over the years have included Judi Dench, Colin Firth, Richard E. Grant, ­Daniel Day-Lewis and Edward Fox.

Mother Hilary, 51, is a former actress (stage name Hilary Gish) who retrained as a 'doula' — someone who assists a pregnant woman before, during and after childbirth.

Jack has a sister Molly, 23, and 20-year-old brother, Barnaby. His godfather is actor Nigel Havers, an old showbiz friend of both his parents.

Last year, the family sold their six-bedroom house overlooking Putney Common for £4.25 million and moved to another house overlooking the Thames nearby, for which they paid £2.55 million. The new property is mortgage-free.

He was privately educated at The Harrodian School in South-West London and £24,000-a-year ­Marlborough College in Wiltshire. Another pupil, the Duchess of ­Cambridge, then Kate Middleton, was five years his senior.
