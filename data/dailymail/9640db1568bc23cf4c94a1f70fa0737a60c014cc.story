Consider two brothers who are identical twins. If one goes to space and the other does not, are they still genetically identical?

That’s what Nasa will be aiming to discover in March 2015 in a ground-breaking experiment that will for the first time study the impact of space travel on the human body in real time, measuring any changes that occur between the two brothers as they happen.

Living in space is known to have effects on the human body, including decreasing bone mass and causing muscle loss.

But, as of yet, we’re not quite sure what it does to the body on a smaller scale.

For example, it could affect our DNA or alter how we age.

To test out theories, Nasa is conducting an unprecedented twin experiment.

In March 2015 Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly will join cosmonaut Mikhair Kornienko on a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

The one-year mission is in itself interesting, as it will be the first time two humans have stayed aboard the ISS continuously for this period of time with missions to date lasting just six months.

However, it is not the longevity of the mission that makes it interesting – while Scott is in space his identical twin brother Mark, a retired NASA astronaut, will remain on the ground as a ‘control’ in the experiment.

Scott will spend a year orbiting Earth at 17,000 miles (27,000 km) per hour while Mark remains on Earth.

Scott's one-year mission on the ISS with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will be the first long-duration stay on the station, with previous missions lasting only six months

‘We will be taking samples and making measurements of the twins before, during and after the one-year mission,’ says Craig Kundrot of Nasa’s Human Research Program at the Johnson Space Center.

For the first time Nasa will be able to monitor ‘two individuals who are genetically identical.’

Nasa recently announced the selection of ten research proposals to study the twins’ genetics, biochemistry, vision, cognition and more.

‘Each proposal is fascinating and could be a feature-length story of its own,’ says Kundrot.

‘We already known that the human immune system changes in space.

‘It’s not as strong as it is on the ground.

‘In one of the experiments, Mark and Scott will be given identical flu vaccines, and we will study how their immune systems react.’

Another experiment will delve into whether humans age differently in orbit.

On Earth, the loss of telomeres from human DNA has been linked to aging.

This loss might be accelerated by cosmic rays.

Comparing the twins’ telomeres will reveal if space travel is causing astronauts to age quicker.

Among the other proposals will be experiments to monitor how vision is affected by space travel, while researchers will also delve into the psychological effects of being in space.

The research, according to Nasa, could provide vital data with a view to one day sending astronauts to more distant destinations in space.

The ‘twin paradox’ is a thought experiment proposed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th Century.

It is derived from his theory of special relativity.

Einstein suggests that the faster you travel, the slower you move through time.

If one twin travelled in a spaceship near the speed of light, they would return home considerably younger than their sibling under laws of special relativity.

Known as ‘time dilation,’ this was proven in 1971 with the Hafele-Keating experiment.

Atomic clocks were set to the same time and then sent in different directions around the world in separate planes.

The clocks were found to have ticked differently, proving special relativity.
