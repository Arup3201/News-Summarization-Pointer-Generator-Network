Wales have complained to the BBC about Sonja McLaughlan’s questioning of coach Warren Gatland at Saturday’s 34-16 defeat by New Zealand.

Gatland was unhappy with questions asked by McLaughlan before and after the match at the Millennium Stadium.

She asked if he felt under pressure after 22 straight defeats by the southern hemisphere nations. Gatland was clearly irked and brushed past the cameras after saying: ‘And you are putting me under pressure as well, thanks.’

McLaughlan said it was her job to ask Gatland questions after Wales' defeat against New Zealand 

The WRU raised concerns with their broadcast partner because they felt the questioning was at odds with a positive interview with man-of-the-match Jamie Roberts.

On Monday McLaughlan, who has worked for the BBC since 1998, tweeted: ‘It is my job to ask questions and I will not be deterred from doing it.’

There was more tension at the Wales press conference at their training camp in the Vale of Glamorgan on Tuesday. McLaughlan’s question was followed up during an interview with defence coach Shaun Edwards who, despite reacting angrily, refused to dodge the issue and responded by referring to Gatland’s impressive record in the Six Nations.

Despite Gatland’s poor record against southern hemisphere teams he is understood to have the full support of the WRFU and is contracted until 2019.

But the decision to raise concerns with the BBC has been criticised on social media, while Edwards’ style of ‘fronting up’ has been applauded.
