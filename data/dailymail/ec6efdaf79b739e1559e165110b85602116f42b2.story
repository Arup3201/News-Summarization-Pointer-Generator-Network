Up to 450 Qantas workers in Victoria and Queensland will lose their jobs as the airline moves to centralise its Australian call centre operations and move just 50 jobs to Hobart.

Qantas announced on Wednesday that their Melbourne call centre, which employs about 250 full-time staff, would close by mid-2015.

Meanwhile, the airline's Brisbane call centre, which employs about 200 full-time staff, will close by 2016.

The move comes as Qantas tries to restructure operations, in attempt to save $2 billion over the next three years.

Getting through the pain together: The Australian Services Union said some call centre staff found out about losing their job through the media

Workers across both facilities will be offered redeployment to Hobart - where the airline plans to operate a single call centre facility by 2016.

The Australian Services Union (ASU), which represents workers at both call centres, said the Victorian call centre is Qantas' only 24-hour operation.

Of the employees, 70 per cent are female and most have been employed by Qantas for more than eight years.

The ASU has attacked the move, claiming it will be customer service that suffers.

ASU Queensland secretary Julie Bignell said some of the Brisbane call centre workers set to lose their jobs didn't even hear about the job cuts from the airline, but through the media.

'This is just an outrageous announcement from Qantas today,' Ms Bignell said.

'That's just an appalling lack of consideration for your loyal employees to have to run around and ask other people whether they've got a job or not.'

'We're all in shock, still all in shock,' one Brisbane worker told Nine News.

Financial assistance available, for those willing to move to Hobart: Financial assistance will be available to Brisbane and Melbourne call centre staff, as long as they are willing to relocate to Hobart

In Melbourne, the Victorian Government has come under fire for not trying to do more to keep positions in the city.

'The Tasmanian Liberal Government fought for these jobs, and our government simply did not,' Victorian Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews said.

'These are hard-working, loyal staff who have worked their guts out for this airline for many, many years,' Australian Services Union Victorian private sector branch secretary Ingrid Stitt said.

'I've been with the company 18 years and seen the decline,' one Melbourne employee told Nine News Melbourne.

'It's a very sad day.'

Affected employees in Melbourne and Brisbane will be offered redeployment to the Hobart call centre.

Financial assistance will be available to workers willing to relocate.

The move to keep the Hobart call centre came following confidential talks with the Tasmanian government.

Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman has declined to give details about how his state secured the future of Qantas' existing Hobart call centre.

Hobart call centre operations will expand from 200 to 250, with Mr Hodgman saying that his government had 'put forward an appropriate support package.'

'Operational complexity': Qantas Domestic CEO Lyell Strambi announced that the move to cease Brisbane and Melbourne call centre operations was part of the airline's attempt to cut $2 billion from it's bottom line over the next three years

Qantas Domestic CEO Lyell Strambi said operating call centres in Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania had become inefficient for the airline.

'Having call centres in three different states presents a number of challenges including property costs, duplication of management and operational complexity,' he said.

Last year, Qantas moved heavy maintenance and catering operations to Brisbane.

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman, who has come under fire for not doing more to keep call centre jobs in Brisbane as well, said he certainly expects 'Qantas will look after the families affected.'
