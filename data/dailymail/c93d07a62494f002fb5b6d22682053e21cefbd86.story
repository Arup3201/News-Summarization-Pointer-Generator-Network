No good deed goes unpunished and one man had to learn that lesson the hard way earlier this month when he was stabbed nine times after asking a man to stop catcalling his girlfriend.

Ben Schwartz, 31, of San Francisco was brutally stabbed nine times while walking home from a party with his girlfriend Miyoko Moody and another friend. He is now recovering from the attack and is in stable condition. 

Schwartz's friend, Daniela Saavedra, said that Schwartz asked a man who had been catcalling his girlfriend to stop after he made passes at her at least two times, reports The San Francisco Chronicle.

Stabbed: Ben Schwartz was brutally stabbed after he told a man to stop catcalling his girlfriend Miyoko Moody 

In recovery: The suspect stabbed Schwartz nine times in the back, face, neck and arms, puncturing a lung and just missing his spine but Schwartz is on the steady road to recovery 

'All he said was, "Can you please just stop?"' Saavedra said.

'The man then sort of trailed behind them, and that’s when he attacked,' she continued.

Schwartz was brutally stabbed in the back, face, arms neck, and even had a punctured lung.

The suspect just nearly missed Schwartz's spinal cord before jumping into a silver sedan.

Police are still on the lookout for the man who ruthlessly stabbed a Good Samaritan.

'He definitely sticks up for women, for anyone really,' Saavedra said.

'If you’re his friend, you’re his friend for life, and I’ve watched him just support many friends through many hard times. He’s just so kind-hearted, and you can see that in everything that he does.'

Helps others: Not only did Ben Schwartz defend his girlfriend, he helped to return a stolen bicycle in February

This isn't the first time Schwartz has made the news for helping someone.,

The San Francisco Chronicle did a story on Schwartz back in February when he bought a bicycle on the street he guessed was stolen then did whatever he could to get it back to its original owner.

The owner of the bike happened to be a freelance photographer for the San Francisco Chronicle.

'I’ve had friends get their cars broken into, smashed-in windows, stolen laptops, stolen cell phone — there’s nothing I can do a lot of those times' Schwartz said in February.

'But this way, it was easy. It was safe, and it got him his bike back. ... I just wanted to do somebody a solid for once.'

Those wishing to help Schwartz in his recovery can donate to his GoFundeMe page.

So far they have raised $17,000  out of their $25,000 goal.

“Street harassment is definitely more dangerous than people think it is,'Saavedra said.

'A point my fiancé brought up was you know this isn’t the first time this man has stabbed someone, or acted out in this way. To be that angry and aggressive and mentally unstable, that is just terrifying to think about.'

There are currently no leads on a suspect responsible brutal attack but those with any information are asked to call (415) 553-0123.
