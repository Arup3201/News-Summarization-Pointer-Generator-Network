Gunned down in his own rectory: Father Gilbert Dasna was shot dead in his church, police believe he may have have been killed by a gunman they shot dead minutes later

A small Canadian town was terrorized Friday by a crazed gunman who is believed to have shot dead a priest inside a church before going on a rampage before he was gunned down by police.

John Quadros, 55, of St Paul, Alberta, was killed by Royal Canadian Mounted Police after he is said by police to have likely killed Father Gilbert Dasna and then going on a high speed chase through the center of town that culminated in a crash derby-like shootout, sources said.

Dasna, 32, was shot more than once on the third anniversary of his arrival from Cameroon while inside his rectory, police told the CBC, they do not believe the murder was a random act of violence.

The mayhem began just before 6.00 p.m. as the town of about 5,400 just over 120 miles east of Edmonton was rocked by the sound of gunfire.

Officers heard shots just outside their station and ran out in pursuit of a black pickup truck being driven by Quadros.

Quadros is said by police to have sped straight for the small town’s central business district and rammed at least one squad car while firing shots at police as he went.

The force of the impact was so great that car parts were scattered across at least half a block.

‘I've seen movie scenes not as horrific as this. There's bits of pieces of vehicle all over the street a half a block away,’ Chief Supt. Randy McInnes told the CBC.

Three Mounties were injured in the fracas and one was forced to fire back in retaliation – the shot killed Quadros while he was still behind the wheel of his vehicle.

The dramatic scene unfolded in broad daylight as locals made their way to restaurants for dinner and home from work.

The smashed up wreckage of multiple vehicles sat in the middle of the town’s busiest street after people scattered to avoid the bullets flying through the air.

‘I was shaken by it to the point where I couldn't properly text a message to my commanding officer to let them know what was going on,’ McInnes added.

A woman who witnessed the chase said Quadros was driving recklessly through a busy area and even on the wrong side of the road at times.

‘The way he was driving I thought he might kill somebody,’ she told the Edmonton Journal. ‘He was just flying.’

The female officer who killed Quadros suffered serious leg injuries, said McInnes. A male officer was shot in the hand and another was hit in the face with glass shards, he added.

The female officer remains hospitalized, the two men were treated and released.

Investigators could not confirm if the priest’s murder was related to the downtown shootout, but refused to rule out the two incidents being more than a coincidence.

They happened only blocks from each other.

Quadros owned a health store that ‘advocated healthy living through herbs and natural products given to us by GOD,’ according to the Journal.

Church officials lamented Dasna’s violent death.

‘It's very disturbing. People don't know what happened,’ said diocese spokesperson Pierre Lamoureux. ‘He was well-loved. He was a man of joy, a man of peace.’

A parishioner told the Journal that Dasna was ‘a nice man [and] you couldn’t ask for a better man.‘Why would anybody kill a priest? I just can’t believe that,’ she added.

Mayor Glenn Anderson was in disbelief over the afternoon’s events.

‘A town of our size… doesn't ever expect this to happen,’ he told the CBC. ‘It's never happened in St. Paul.’

‘I'm just really shaken up by the whole incident.’An investigation into both crime scenes remains ongoing.
