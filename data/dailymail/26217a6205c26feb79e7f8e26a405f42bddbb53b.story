Patricia Burland, a benefits cheat who was caught building a swimming pool in her back garden, has been forced to sell her house to repay the £50,000 she swindled

A benefits cheat caught building a swimming pool in her back garden has been forced to sell her house to repay the £50,000 she swindled.

Mother-of-four Patricia Burland told fraud investigators she was paying for the pool with contributions from her sons.

But a judge today ordered the 53-year-old to sell her house so she could repay the taxpayer.

Burland made a valid application for income support on the basis she was a single parent, Southampton Crown Court heard.

But she failed to tell the authorities that from March 2005 her husband Adrian was again living with her full time.

She was caught after the Department for Works and Pensions launched an investigation and carried out surveillance on her home.

Surveillance confirmed her husband’s works van was parked outside early in the morning and late at night, in Southampton, Hampshire.

Initially she admitted he had been staying with her for a few nights a week but later confirmed they had been living together again.

Burland explained she was 'scared' her benefit would stop and her husband would leave her.

She was also in arrears with her mortgage.

Burland admitted two breaches of failing to declare a change of circumstance and received a 24 week suspended sentence with 12 months supervision.

Prosecutor Patrick Moran told the court the fraud amounted to £47,914.28 and her realisable assets stood at £76.569.32.

Andy Houston, defending, said Burland
lacked self confidence to stand up to her husband and was clearly 
concerned about threats he would leave her.

He confirmed Burland would have to sell her home to pay the cash back.

An earlier hearing heard she had been
paying £100 a month to clear the debt, which Mr Houston accepted was 
clearly 'a drop in the ocean'.

But she now has just six months to pay with up to 18 months in default of payment.

Judge Susan Evans told the earlier hearing the money had been taken from the public over a 'substantial period'.
