A Chicago bride found herself in quite a bind on Thursday ... and has the President of the United States to thank for it.

If weddings aren't stressful enough, Debra-Ann Robinson was en route to her own when the roads were suddenly closed.

She was stuck in the car on Lake Shaw Drive, near North Avenue Beach, waiting for the official motorcade of Barrack Obama to get its green light corridor.

'I was pretty nervous,' Robinson told Fox 32.

Officially stalled: Debra-Ann Robinson was en route to her wedding Thursday morning when Lake Shaw Drive was closed to make way for the President's motorcade

Hold up: The busy expressway was closed in both directions for about 30 minutes to make way for Obama

Eek: The groom, Robert Sanders, was nervously waiting for his bride-to-be at Cook County's Marriage Court, wondering if or when she was going to show

Obama was traveling from his home in Kenwood to Evanston, but the journey caused the busy expressway to close down in both directions.

Not only was Robinson stalled for 30 minutes, her groom, Robert Sanders, was stuck at the altar, wondering whether she was ever going to turn up.

The couple were worried they might lose their reservation.

'Of course my nerves were shot, still is a little bit, but I'm a lot better now,' Sanders told Fox 32.

The wait was so long Robinson got out of the car, so as to not crush her dress.

'We stopped and I stretched my legs and there were a bunch of people taking pictures,' she said.

Lights, camera, action: Robinson because quite a hit among the drivers who were struck in the traffic, with many taking pictures of her

The couple, who met on the train eight months ago but said it was love at first sight, were eventually married at Cook County's Marriage Court.

'I'm just happy that everything worked out.' Sanders said.

Obama spent the day discussing the economy in Chicago and Indiana before flying to Washington D.C.
