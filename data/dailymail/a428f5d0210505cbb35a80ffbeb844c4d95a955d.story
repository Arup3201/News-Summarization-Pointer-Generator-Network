One lucky buyer will soon call Australia's highest piece of real estate home: a stunning penthouse that towers almost 280 metres above Melbourne's Southbank.

The luxurious penthouse that takes up the whole 84th floor of Eureka Tower  and boasts unrivaled 360-degree views of the Victorian capital is for sale.

In June last year, the 660-square-metre apartment was listed for $18 million, The Age reported.

But if it sells for more than $20 million this time around, it will be Melbourne's most expensive apartment.

Australia's highest piece of residential real estate has never been lived in, and boasting a lush interior and 360-degree views of the Victorian capital

It's not just the exterior that's impressive. Potential owners of the penthouse, that has never been lived in before, will be greeted by a closed-off marble lobby as soon as they step out of the elevator.

It also boasts floor-to-ceiling windows, and four bedrooms with large his-and-hers dressing rooms.

The marble theme is peppered throughout the apartment, featured on bench tops in the kitchen and bathrooms.

The Eureka Tower penthouse's lush look is paired with the latest technology, where lights, heating and cooling, security and doors can all be controlled remotely by an iPad or iPhone.

The stunning apartment even boasts a private study, framed on one side by wall-length bookshelves and by floor-to-ceiling windows on the other

Hooked up to the latest technology, airconditioning and heating, blinds, lighting, doors and security can be controlled with a touch of a button from two control centers, or with an iPad or iPhone

A dream for tech nerds, the apartment also has LCD televisions and a state-of-the-art audio system installed throughout the house.

With features like this, it is right at home in the Eureka Tower complex. The only residence that comes close to rivalling the million-dollar address in height is the level-74 penthouse in the southern hemisphere’s tallest skyscraper, Q1; located on Queensland's Gold Coast.

That penthouse sits at about 217 metres high, overlooking Queensland's stunning coastline.

Melbourne-based agents Sotheby’s International Realty are behind the sale, and kept tight-lipped about the price.

The Eureka penthouse is more than twice the size of a brand-new Australian house, but if it sells for $20 million, it's also 40 times as expensive.

It is believed Sotheby is marketing the lofty apartment to international house hunters with deep pockets.
