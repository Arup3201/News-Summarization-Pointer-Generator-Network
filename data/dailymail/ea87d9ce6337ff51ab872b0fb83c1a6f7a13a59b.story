The ‘vow’ by David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, in the left-wing Daily Record newspaper yesterday, amounts to Westminster capitulating to demands made by the Scottish left-wing establishment in recent years.

Yet, despite having huge constitutional and financial implications for everybody in the UK, the three party leaders cooked them up behind closed doors without any proper debate – and with Gordon Brown at the fore.

Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines the ‘bribes’ which have been offered north of the border in a desperate attempt to sway tomorrow’s referendum.

Desperate: The Yes vote has had a strong final push and almost all polls have the two sides neck and neck

A financial sweetener that perpetuates a system by which Scotland gets £1,623 – 19 per cent – more expenditure per head than England. The Barnett formula, devised in the 1970s by then Labour Chief Secretary to the Treasury Joel Barnett, was meant as a temporary measure to solve rows in the Callaghan government over how much money should be allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

But politicians have repeatedly ducked the challenge of reforming it – mostly for fear of provoking a row with the Scots. The decision is yet another U-turn by David Cameron who said in 2008 the formula ‘cannot last forever’.

The idea of resources shared ‘equitably’ will raise a hollow laugh across the rest of the UK, given the capitulation over Barnett.

Unlike those living in England, Scots are already able to enjoy free social care for the elderly and free student tuition.

Wales claims the decision to preserve Barnett will leave the country £300million a year poorer than if money was allocated fairly.

Deal: Alex Salmond and David Cameron in 2012 signing the agreement which led to tomorrow's referendum

A counter to claims by Alex Salmond that the NHS is under threat from Westminster. The running of the health service north of the border is already the responsibility of Holyrood.

But new powers – expected to allow Holyrood to vary the income tax rate by at least 15p in the pound – would allow extra money to be raised for healthcare. With Scotland in charge of every aspect of its own NHS, there is little or no justification for allowing Scottish MPs to continue to vote on the running of the NHS in England.

A statement seemingly tossed out without consideration of the constitutional implications. The Scottish Parliament is the result of legislation enacted by Westminster, which could be repealed.

No Parliament can bind its successor – yet the leaders are promising to do exactly that. Experts say the only way to make Holyrood permanent would be to introduce the UK’s first ever written constitution – a task that could take Parliament years to achieve.

Cameron, Clegg and Miliband have no agreement among their parties to give new powers to the Scots or change the constitution.

The deal has been hatched behind closed doors, with Brown taking a lead role.

Mr Cameron can expect a rebellion by Tory MPs who want an English parliament in which Scots can not sway the vote on issues with no effect on their constituents.

What is certain is that, in the event of a No vote, the last nine months of the current Parliament will be dominated by the fallout. There is already resentment that the vow was made in a Scottish newspaper, without any warning.
