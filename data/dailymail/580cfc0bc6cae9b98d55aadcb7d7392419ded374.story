The Premier League may only be three weeks old but there have already been plenty of twists and turns. Chelsea have set their stall out early with nine points from nine while Louis van Gaal's Manchester United have stuttered. 

Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10  Premier League performers from the weekend. It's no surprise that Diego Costa tops the lead after his double at Everton but who else makes the top 10 in our Player Performance Index PPI chart?

10. Gabriel Agbonlahor, Aston Villa (PPI score: 40.2)

Aston Villa, with Roy Keane as their new assistant manager, have made a solid if unspectacular start to the Premier League season and Gabby Agbonlahor found the net in his side's win over Hull, converting one of just two shots on target.

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning Performance

2. Player's Performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Graziano Pelle, Southampton (41.1)

Southampton were expected to struggle after offloading a host of players over the summer but in Graziano Pelle the Saints look to have found a mean marksman worthy of filling Rickie Lambert's boots at St Mary's

As well as scoring against West Ham, he completed 27 passes at Upton Park. 

8. Kevin Mirallas, Everton (41.9)

He might be overlooked in favour of his more illustrious team-mate and countryman Romelu Lukaku but Kevin Mirallas has proved himself a valuable asset at Goodison Park.

He found the back of the net against Chelsea last Saturday and enjoyed a 92 per cent pass accuracy. Unfortunately his performance wasn't enough to prevent Everton losing 6-3. 

Back of the net: Kevin Mirallas was on the scoresheet as Everton lost a nine-goal thriller with Chelsea

Short lived: Mirallas ended up on the losing side as Everton failed to stem the tide at Goodison Park 

7. Nemanja Matic, Chelsea (45)

If anyone doubted why Chelsea splashed out £22million to bring Nemanja Matic BACK to Stamford Bridge, he is starting to show them.

The 26-year-old has cemented his position in what is a highly competitive midfield and he proved his worth with a goal and an assist in his side's win over Everton. 

Midfield maestro: Nemanja Matic has consolidated his position in the middle of the park for Chelsea 

6. Andreas Weimann, Aston Villa (45)

There hasn't been much to smile about down at Villa Park over the last few seasons but Andreas Weimann has proved himself a consistent performer for Paul Lambert.

He showed his versatility against Hull, scoring one, setting up another and making four successful tackles. 

Foot in: Andreas Weimann (above and below) was the heartbeat of the Villa side as they beat Hull last weekend

5. Ramires, Chelsea (45.8)

Chelsea may have added Cesc Fabregas to their already burgeoning midfield this summer but Ramires continues to quietly impress for Jose Mourinho's side.

He too managed to get on the scoresheet against Everton in what became something of a free-for-all. He also set up to others for his team-mates. 

Squeezed in: Ramires was also on the scoresheet during Chelsea's win over Everton  

4. Raheem Sterling, Liverpool (46.3)

Last season was something of a breakthrough for Raheem Sterling as LIverpool finished second in the Premier League and he jetted off to Brazil with the England squad. While he may not wish to be reminded of the failed World Cup campaign, Sterling continues to impress at Anfield.

Against Tottenham on Sunday, he scored the opener and completed three dribbles. 

Stunning start: Raheem Sterling opened the scoring for Liverpool at Tottenham on Sunday 

3. Morgan Schneiderlin, Southampton (55.6)

While Southampton bought well over summer, perhaps their biggest achievement was keeping midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin at the club amid frenzied interest from Liverpool and Tottenham.

And despite an initial outburst from the Frenchman, he appears to have put the speculation to the back of his mind. He scored twice against West Ham and  enjoyed a 91.8 per cent pass completion rate. 

Main man: Morgan Schneiderlin is still at Southampton after being linked with a move away this summer 

2. Nathan Dyer, Swansea (56.5) 

Swansea had something of a turbulent season last year but manager Gary Monk has presided over an impressive start to this campaign. He looks to be getting the best out of Nathan Dyer who had two shots on target and scored with both. He also made 21 passes in West Brom's half last weekend.

Not so Dyer: Swansea's Nathan has been integral to their side during an impressive start to the season 

1. Diego Costa, Chelsea (65.6)

As Chelsea scored six past Everton on Sunday, one player stood head and shoulders above the rest. A £32million buy from Atletico Madrid, Diego Costa had his doubters when he arrived on these shores but slowly but surely he is proving them wrong with a stunning start to the season.

At Goodison on Saturday, he scored twice from his four shots on target. 

Six of the best: Diego Costa scores Chelsea's final goal against Everton at Goodison Park 

Jumping for joy: Costa grabbed a double as he showed he needs no time to bed in to the Premier League
