When a much loved relative dies it is only natural to want to pay a lasting tribute to them.

Jersey Shore star Jenni 'JWoww' Farley decided the best way to have a tasteful reminder to her grandmother who passed away recently would be to have a tattoo put on her back in her memory.

She showed off the artwork, which seemed to show the name Oma, on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon this weekend.

Here it is: Jenni Farley shows off her tattoo in memory of her late grandmother on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon this weekend

Close-up: Jenni's tattoo appears to have the name Oma written in black ink which is the German term for grandmother

Tribute: JWoww got the tattoo during her recent trip to Florence to film the fourth season of Jersey Shore

She said she had the tattoo done during the cast's trip to Italy earlier this year.

She said:  'My grandmother's birthday, her 90th, would have been when I was out there, and I wanted to get her on me somewhere, I didn't know when and I didn't know how.

'My grandmother passed away in February and her 90th would have been in May, so I was filming there and I found a perfect Florence artist to put my grandmother on me.'

Oma is the German term for grandmother.

Slimline: Jenni Farley flaunted her new skinnier look on Jimmy Fallon's popular talk show

In another development her co-star 
Deena Cortese has revealed she went under the knife and had a nose job 
in a bid to artificially bolster her image.

The 26-year-old spoke out in support of 
fellow cast member JWoww, who caused a flurry of speculation she had 
more plastic surgery after debuting a new slimline figure.

But the reality star said she would back Jwoww if the speculation proved to be true.

She said: 'If she did, more power to you. I actually had a nose job.'

The news is sure to come as a surprise to fans, who see the brassy Italian American as a style icon.

However her unnaturally angled nose bears all the hallmarks of a surgically enhanced beak.

The speculation about Jenni was 
sparked by the show's new season premiere on August 4, in which she 
debuted her new slimline look.

Bombshell? Deena struck Marilyn Monroe's famous pose but the jury is out on whether she looked as good

She
has been very open about having breast implants, so many assumed she 
had additional work done to achieve her more slender figure.

However Jenni responded to the rumours 
on Twitter, writing, 'Flattered I'm the topic of tabloids. Funny what 
people assume when you lose weight and  tone.'

The Jersey Shore girls in the show are proving to be unlikely icons to hordes of teenagers, so the news they are happy to go under the knife to enhance their looks is sure to spark fears it could encourage more youngsters to go down a similar path.

And their outrageous hard partying behaviour has also raised concerns they are unsuitable role models.

However it seems to be paying off for the cast of the show.

The girls are featuring on the cover of this month's YRB magazine, and celebrated by attending a swanky party in New York.

Snooki and her best friend Deena attended the event to promote the publication.

And the mini pocket rocket is taking advantage of her newfound fame to rake in the cash.

The star, real name Nicole Polizzi was recently named one of the top 10 earning stars on TV, with her $100,000 per episode placing her alongside the likes of Simon Cowell and David Letterman.

She cashed in further by taking part in a book-signing to promote her tome A Shore Thing yesterday.

And while it is sure to shoot to the top of the best-seller lists, it is unlikely to be a literary achievement to rival George Orwell's 1984, JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings or even Katie Price's infamous 2006 novel Angel.
