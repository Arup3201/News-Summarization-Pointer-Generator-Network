Jessica Ennis tonight lived up to her pre-Games billing as the golden girl of British athletics by storming to gold in the Olympic heptathlon.

The 26-year-old Sheffield star earned Great Britain's twelfth gold - and Team GB's fourth of five on 'Super Saturday' - following her 1st place finish in the 800m.

Roared on by a partisan 80,000 crowd, home favourite Ennis looked overcome with emotion after becoming Olympic champion at her first ever athletics contest in London.

Ennis, the pin-up girl of British athletics, had already amassed a 188-point lead in the heptathlon going into tonight's 800m.

And in front of flag-waving fans, The 
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prime Minister David Cameron and Olympics
 supremo Lord Coe, she never looked like slipping up on the track 
tonight.

Ennis 
eventually powered to a spectacular victory in the heptathlon finale, 
dominating the field in the 800m to win the event and with it her first 
Olympic crown.

Her huge final heptathlon points total of 6995 gave Ennis a 300-point margin over her nearest rival.

Earlier, in what were widely expected 
to be two of the toughest rounds of the contest for Ennis, Britain's 
golden girl put in a 6.48m long jump, making her just one of two 
athletes to earn more than 1,000 points in the sandpit.

It came after she built up a 184 
point-lead on a phenomenal first day of action in the stadium yesterday,
 setting a British record in the 100m hurdles, a personal best in the 
200m, and a clearance of 1.86m in the high jump.

Second time lucky: She was greeted with a massive cheer as she jumped 6.40m in the second round

Relief: Ennis punched the air in jubilation when she saw the distance, smiling widely

Throughout the competition, the flag-waving home crowd had gone wild when Ennis's beaming smile was projected on the big screens.

Draped in a Union flag, Amy Richards, 28, of Stoke Newington, north London, said she felt lucky to be part of the Olympics.

'They said there were two billion applications for some of the tickets in the stadium,' she said.

'It was unbelievable. The noise, the flags, the excitement - even the sun's come out.'It's been an amazing day, absolutely amazing.'

She sent the Olympic stadium 
into raptures yesterday with Act One of a stellar heptathlon performance
 – then she got set for gold.

Ennis brought a capacity crowd to its feet with a 
sensational start to the athletics, setting a British record in the 
event for the 100-metre hurdles.

At
 one stage she was conducting applause from the track by raising her 
arms and turning 360 degrees around the vast Olympic stadium, creating 
the most electrifying atmosphere it has seen so far.

Go girl! Go Jess!’ they bellowed, chanting ‘En-nis! En-nis!’ until it reached a crescendo.

But the Sheffield-born champion was 
rendered ‘speechless’ when she saw her 12.54 second record for the 
100-metre hurdles flash up on the scoreboard – a lifetime best, and 
equal to the gold medal winning time in the women’s hurdles in Beijing.

The
 amazing performance propelled her instantly to the top of the leader 
board, precisely the kind of start she needed. And still the crowd 
cheered.

Jubilant: Ennis had been in trouble with a first round jump of 5.95m, significantly down on her rival Tatyana Chernova's 6.54m. But she managed   6.40m in the second round and 6.48m in the third

‘Show us yer 
abs!’, a lone voice demanded as she took off her tracksuit for the high 
jump. (The 2012 poster girl has come to be known as the Ab Fab pin-up 
because of her enviable six-pack abdominal muscles and torso, repeatedly
 grandstanded yesterday to the delight of front-row spectators).

Sometimes
 the crowd cranked up the volume so much it drowned out the names of the
 athletes as they were announced on loudspeakers. When they clapped and 
stamped their feet, it vibrated all through the stands.

It
 just blew me away to be honest,’ Ennis said afterwards. ‘How much they 
got behind me was amazing. You try and prepare yourself but it’s nothing
 like you can imagine. It was a great start to the day.’

The athletics were conducted in breaks between a loudspeaker soundtrack that blared out hits from the Rolling Stones and David Bowie, among others – plus Bob Marley’s Sun is Shining when it pelted with rain for a few minutes, flooding uncovered areas in the stands and drenching lower-tier spectators in their seats.

Barely a single empty seat could be spotted inside the stadium when Ennis and her team-mates were in the arena.

Her parents Vinnie Ennis and Alison Powell were here – waving a Union Flag and cheering their daughter towards victory at every stage. ‘This is her dream,’ they said – then spoke of their hopes that she will achieve her ambition to win gold in front of a home crowd.

High hopes: Jessica Ennis fell slightly behind 
in the heptathlon after a disappointing shot put, but is expected to 
claw back some ground in the 200m

She has dreamed about this for so long,’ Miss Powell said. ‘It has been a long wait, and she has worked very hard.’

Elsewhere, crowds gathered at a giant screen in the Olympic Park, the Stratford equivalent of Wimbledon’s Murray Mount.

There was another in Sheffield’s Don Valley stadium, where she first ran as a 13-year-old. Her secondary school hosted a final ‘good luck’ celebration, and the city council appeared to have contingency plans to cope with a chaotic homecoming if she returns triumphant.

On the internet, Facebook mentions of ‘Ennis’ increased 600-fold around the time she chalked up her first stunning result.

But it meant Ennis, who was absent from Beijing four years ago through injury, is now under intense pressure to come up with a gold.

Uniquely in the public mind, and possibly in her own, winning mere silver would be regarded as failure. Tony Minichiello, her coach since childhood, said she was probably the only person in the British track-and-field team who, if she fails to win gold, it would be viewed as a loss.
