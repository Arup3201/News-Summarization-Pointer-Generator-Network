Chancellor George Osborne urged people not to go to A&E if they do not need to

The A&E crisis has left patients to be treated in store cupboards because their is not enough room in clinical areas, George Osborne was warned today.

The Chancellor said the treatment was a 'matter of regret' for the whole government as he urged people not to go to A&E if they do not need to.

It comes as leaked figures show that last week every NHS trust missed the target for seeing patients in A&E within four hours. 

The soaring number of visits has been blamed on an ageing population and patients flocking to hospitals to have minor ailments treated.

The government has come under increasing pressure over the winter crisis in the NHS, with Labour vowing to make the health service a central plank of its election campaign.

Senior doctors warn that since April there have been more than 14 million visits to A&E, a rise of 446,049 on the previous year. 

NHS bosses warn it could take up to five years to tackle the problems causing backlogs in A&E departments.  

Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Mr Osborne was challenged over the story of a viewer who was looked after in a store cupboard because there was no room for him in the A&E department.

The Chancellor said: 'Every time a patient doesn't get the treatment that they deserve, that's a matter of regret. It is a matter of regret to me, it is a matter of regret to every member of the Government. First thing I'd say is the NHS staff is doing a brilliant job. 

'We've put a lot of money into the NHS, partly because we've prioritised it, partly because we have a strong and growing economy.'

He went on: 'There are more nurses, more doctors, but the truth is, I think everyone will understand this, there a rea lot more people going to A&E, more than a million more people going to A&E. 

'I think we need to make sure that people have all the information they need about where they need to go if they feel there is something wrong with and they're not feeling well. And A&E is not always the answer for people. 

'We've got to address why people aren't going to doctors surgeries, why they're not necessarily phoning the helplines that are available.'

The soaring number of visits to A&E has been blamed on an ageing population and patients flocking to hospitals to have minor ailments treated 

It comes as ministers brace themselves for the latest set of waiting times figures for January 5 and 11.

Data obtained by the Daily Mirror shows that every trust in England, excluding foundation trusts, has failed to hit the target of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients within four hours.

In some areas last week a third of people had to wait for more than four hours. 

Professor Keith Willett, who led a review of England's casualty units, yesterday insisted there was 'quick fix' to the chaos in many hospitals, which has seen the numbers visiting A&E surge by 400,000 since April as a result of the NHS 111 helpline.

More doctors and nurses need to be recruited and the funding system changed to reduce waiting times and prevent bed blocking by elderly patients waiting for social care.

Giving evidence to the health select committee, he said the entire health system needed to be overhauled to ensure changes in one area do not impact other parts of the NHS.

'We have had numerous examples over numerous years of doing one really good initiative in one part of the pathway and it doesn't have the effect we expect because the rest of the pathway is sufficiently busy to negate the advantages of that.'

A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'We know the NHS is busier than ever before, which is why we've given a record £700million this winter for 700 more doctors, nearly 4500 more nurses and 5000 more beds. 

'The NHS has ensured there are plans in every area to manage the extra demand.'
