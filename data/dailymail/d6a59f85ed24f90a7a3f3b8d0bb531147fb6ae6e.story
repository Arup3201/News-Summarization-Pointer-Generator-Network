As she showcased her toned physique on the cover of this month's Esquire, Cameron Diaz proved that 40 really is the new 20.

And the 42-year-old Hollywood actress isn't the only over-40 giving women half her age a run for their money.

Esquire has celebrated women at 42 in it's latest issue - and that includes the likes of Jennifer Garner, Sofia Vergara, Jada Pinkett Smith, Christina Applegate and Carmen Electra.

Forty IS the new twenty: Cameron Diaz, looking younger and better than ever, covers the August issue of Esquire magazine and one of its writer even dedicated an entire article in praise of 42-year-olds like her

In praise of the older woman, writer Tom Junod says in Esquire: 'Let's face it: There used to be something tragic about even the most beautiful forty-two-year-old woman.

'With half her life still ahead of her, she was deemed to be at the end of something - namely, everything society valued in her, other than her success as a mother.

'If she remained sexual, she was either predatory or desperate; if she remained beautiful, what gave her beauty force was the fact of its fading. And if she remained alone... well, then God help her.'

But with Cameron Diaz gracing its glossy cover in all her toned glory, the men's magazine believe that what's made these women figures of fantasy is their confidence.

All hail 42: Writing in praise of the older woman, like 42-year-old Sofia Vergara, writer Tom Jundod argues that there used to be something tragic about even the most beautiful forty-two-year-old woman, now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free

'A few generations ago, a woman turning forty-two was expected to voluntarily accept the shackles of biology and convention; now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free,' writes Junod.

And this seems to be backed up by recent research, which revealed that today's over 40's generally feel happier, as well as wiser and more confident than they did in their 20's.

The study found that 56 per cent of women over 40 believe they look younger than their actual age.

The research, carried out by nice 'n' easy, also found that 64 per cent of
women over 40 say if they could give one piece of advice to their 20-year-old selves, they would tell them to have confidence in themselves.

Cameron even said in a recent interview: 
‘[This] is the best time of my life. I love being this age. I can’t wait
 to be older. The most interesting parts are for women who are over 40. 
We don’t see it that way, because they’re not the sexy parts.

‘We’re not giving those women enough credit for what they’re accomplishing, which is beautiful performances.’

Junod does, however, points out: 'Of course, they have to work for their advantage; they have armored themselves with yoga and Pilates even as they joke about the spectacle.'

And right he is, Cameron is a huge yoga advocate and is often spotted working out at the gym. She even penned The Body Book: The Law of Hunger, the Science of Strength, and Other Ways to Love Your Amazing Body.

In it, Cameron passes down lessons gleaned through personal experience and as a result of her access to the top nutritionists in the world.

She writes about healthy meal choices, which she discussed during a Wednesday appearance on Dr. Oz.

Jennifer Garner is also a yoga devotee, while Sofia Vergara says working out is not her 
idea of enjoyment. ‘For me it’s punishment,’ she said recently.

However, the Modern Family star, who was
 diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 28, says she knows exercise is 
important for her health and tries to work out three times a week with 
celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson, or she does spinning and Pilates.

Peter Lloyd, journalist and author of forthcoming book Stand By Your Manhood, mused: ‘As the life expectancy goes up, the mean age for "youth" increases.

'Ever since The Golden Girls hit TV screens in the eighties - way before Sex and the City - women have redefined age on their own terms - glamour and sex are no longer the preserve of twentysomethings.

'Kylie Minogue, Kate Beckinsale and Kristin Davis are all fine examples of this. They illustrate how looking good doesn’t necessarily mean looking young.

‘Meanwhile, men like George Clooney and Jon Hamm are flying the flag for blokes. One of the best films to show sexuality across age lines is Shopgirl with Claire Danes and Steve Martin - it illustrates how, increasingly, age is nothing but a number. People are confident in showing their sexual and social duplicity throughout their entire lives.

’That said, there is still a double-standard. Older women with a sexual appetite are considered cougars, whereas guys are written off as dirty old men or creeps. Women complain about slut shaming and the like, but so many of them are guilty of it in reverse. Perhaps all this renewed confidence will help end that too.’
