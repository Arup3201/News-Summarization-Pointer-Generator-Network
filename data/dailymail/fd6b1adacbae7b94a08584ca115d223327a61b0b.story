It's one thing to try it in training, but a whole different concept to do it at the World Cup in Brazil.

Yet Sergio Ramos seems to have his 'Panenka' penalty down to a fine art - something David De Gea now knows all too well after a Spain training session.

The Real Madrid defender steps up from 12 yards, only to chip to ball down the middle and leave the Manchester United goalkeeper slightly embarrassed and visibly annoyed.

De Gea is unlikely to get a look in during the World Cup with regular first-choice 'keeper Iker Casillas picked for Brazil.

Spain are among the favourites to go far in the world's greatest tournament, having won it in 2010, and are in fine form after their pre-World Cup friendlies.

Having seen off Italy 1-0 in March and Bolivia 2-0 at the end of May, they face El Salvador on Saturday night in their final friendly before the tournament kicks off.
