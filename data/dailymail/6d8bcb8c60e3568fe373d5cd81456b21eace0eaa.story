A BBC reporter assaulted by Rolf Harris believes the shamed entertainer may have claimed many more victims.

Letitia Fitzpatrick, who was abused by her childhood hero in front of young children, says the revelations at his trial may be only ‘the tip of the iceberg’.

She was 29 when she interviewed him after he led an art class in Belfast in 1991 for youngsters aged five to 12.

‘He told me he had a grown-up daughter and I said I was a mother with two children aged two and one,’ the 52-year-old recalled.

‘We went outside and children were playing around us.

‘He was standing there with me and my cameraman went to pack up his gear.

'I was saying thank you very much for the interview, suddenly he grabbed my face with both hands, pulling me towards him and forced his tongue into my mouth.

‘Then he turned on his heel and walked away as if nothing had happened. I felt disgusted and dirty. I thought it was really perverted. I went back to the BBC and I didn’t mention it to anyone. I wanted to forget about it.’

Miss Fitzpatrick said the incident destroyed her image of a man she considered to epitomise family entertainment.

She added: ‘Growing up he was like a favourite uncle to me, he always had that avuncular appeal.

'Jimmy Savile was weird, some people found him creepy, while Rolf Harris did not appear to be.

‘What he did was opportunistic and predatory and random – he did not care that I was a journalist.

'The more I thought about it, the more I thought there is no way it was a one off.’

Miss Fitzpatrick did not contact police because she did not know it was an offence and doubted whether she would be believed.

It was not until she read that Harris had been arrested that she decided to report the matter to the police. ‘I can imagine how difficult it was for these women to make such serious allegations against Harris,’ she said.

‘I wanted to support them because I thought it was the right thing to do.’

Miss Fitzpatrick blasted Harris’s lawyers yesterday for attempting to gag the media after his arrest, saying she would not have come forward had she not heard of the other cases.

‘It’s reprehensible. I found it shocking,’ she added.

‘Some of his behaviour in court has been totally bizarre when he sang and performed.

'I just felt it must have been harrowing for his victims giving evidence against him and then to see him behaving like that, it appears he wasn’t taking them seriously. It’s astonishingly arrogant.

‘It shows contempt for the judicial process and denial that he has done anything wrong. I just found it horrifying.

‘What happened to me was not as serious as what a lot of other people suffered, but he thought he could do that to me with impunity.’
