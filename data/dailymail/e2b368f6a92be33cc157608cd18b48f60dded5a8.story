This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby has admitted that she might eat her placenta if she were to get pregnant again.

The mother of two made the revelation during a discussion with placenta specialist Lynnea Shrief on today's show.

Shrief is an advocate of new mothers eating their placenta immediately after giving birth, and even runs a company that turns the organ into capsules that the mother can keep taking in the days following childbirth.

Kim Kardashian has revealed that she wants to eat her placenta after giving birth next month and today Holly Willoughby admitted that she might try it if she had another baby

Last week Kim Kardashian revealed that she plans to eat her placenta following the birth of her first child next month.

In Sunday night's episode of her reality show the 32-year-old revealed that she was having a baby girl and then shocked viewers when she told her doctor that she hopes to eat the placenta after the birth.

'Don’t you think it makes you look younger? I really want to do it,' Kim said, much to the horror of her mother Kris Jenner.

Kim would not be the first celebrity mother to eat her placenta for its nutritious benefits.

It's
a girl! It was revealed that Kim and Kanye were having a girl on the 
season eight premiere of Keeping Up With The Kardashians on Sunday night

After the birth of her son Xander, January Jones widely spoke about how she had eaten hers, although she was unsure at first.

The actress told People Magazine: 'It's something I was very hesitant about, but we're only the only mammals who don't ingest our own placentas. It's not witch-crafty or anything! I suggest it to all moms!'

As well as reportedly helping you 'appear youthful', Chinese herbalists among others believe that re-ingesting the protective layer that connects the baby to the wall of the uterus is a great way to nourish the body following childbirth.

The placenta contains high levels of oxytocin, and as hormone levels drop after giving birth, is believed to be a good way to replace them, which can prevent postpartum depression.

On This Morning today Shrief, founder of the IPEN Placenta Network, explained why she thinks the 'afterbirth practise' is so important.

Shrief said: 'Every other mammal on the planet comsumes the placenta imediately after birth. It helps increase breast milk supply, reduces bleeding and increases iron levels and energy.

'It is a  normal, natural way to heal quicker and feel better after birth. It contains iron, hormones, minerals and has a much higher absorption rate than supplements.

Presenter Holly seemed squeamish at first when discussing the merits of eating placenta

During the early part of the discussion 
32-year-old Holly appeared to get squeamish at the thought but had come 
round to the idea by the end of the chat after listening to Shrief's 
argument.

Shrief 
advises mothers to drink a smoothie made of raw placenta immediately 
after the birth for maximum benefit and then encapsulate the rest.

She
added: 'It 
doesn't taste like liver at all, in fact you can't taste it when mixed 
with fruit in a smoothie and every new mum that I have made one for says
how delicious it is.

Also 
part of the debate was journalist Sally Windsor who is horrified by the 
thought and says that new mothers should be concentrating on their new 
babies rather than indulging in 'faddy diets'.

Windsor said: I
can't think of anything worse than doing this after birth - isn't there
enough pressure on new mums without bringing this in to it - it's like 
caveman behaviour!

'There is no proof that it works and it is just another faddy diet.'

Holly wrapped up the discussion by saying: 'The jury's out, I'm not saying I wouldn't do it.'

Co-host
Phillip Schofield then cheekily quipped: 'If you say that you'll be 
straight on the MailOnline!' before Holly said with a smile and a wave: 'Hello 
MailOnline!'.

It's only natural: January Jones is one of the celebrities to admit to eating her own placenta, will Holly be next?
