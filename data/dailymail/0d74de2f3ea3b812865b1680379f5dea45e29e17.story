From the cabbage soup to potato-only diet, there have been a whole number of single-ingredient slimming methods that promised to shed fat fast.

And now the mushroom plan is being touted as the latest weapon for savvy celeb dieters who want to shed pounds quickly but still keep some of their curves.

Dubbed the ‘M-Plan’, the new diet based on mushrooms promises to help women lose weight from their tums, bums, thighs and upper arms, but still keep their bust intact.

M plan: The mushroom diet is the latest crazy diet to be taking tinseltown by storm and Roxanne Pallett and Katy Perry swear by the power of the vegetables

The ‘M-Plan’ is a favourite among 
celebrities like Emmerdale's Roxanne Pallett who to want to drop a dress size quickly in time for red 
carpet events such as Soap Awards.

The diet promises to help women lose weight from the stubborn areas over a 14-day 
period by replacing
 just one regular lunchtime snack or dinner with a mushroom inspired 
dish.

Women’s nutritionist and health broadcaster, Jeannette Jackson, explains: 'If we eat more 
mushrooms, it’s likely that less high calorie foods will be consumed 
throughout the day over all because of the vegetable’s powerful 
nutritional values.

'The 
dietary fibre in mushrooms helps promote good bowel function leaving you
 feeling more satisfied, so you won’t be hungry again as quickly, 
preventing you from snacking.

Big fan: According to nutritionists, not only do mushrooms help with weight loss - the super vegetable can help improve your looks too and it seems to be working for super slimmer Kelly Osbourne who is a fan

'Mushrooms
 are also extremely rich in protein – an ideal nutritional food source 
yet the vegetable is low in calories which is important where weight 
loss is considered.

'There’s
 a myth that the waist is the last area of the body where women lose 
weight. In fact, it’s one of the areas of the body that we move the most
 along with bums, thighs and upper arms. 

'Not
 only do mushrooms help with weight loss – the super vegetable can help 
improve your looks too given that mushrooms are high in B vitamins, iron
 and zinc, all of which are needed to make your skin, hair and nails 
strong, healthy and shiny.'

Avid
 fans include celebrities such as Emmerdale and Waterloo Road star, 
Roxanne Pallett, plus Kelly Osbourne, who both claim to have lost dress 
sizes from eating raw mushrooms regularly.

How effective is it? According to nutritionists, you simply have to have one meal full of mushrooms, which works for healthy stir frys, but surely not for full English fry ups

Popstar Katy Perry eats a
 diet heavy in mushrooms to keep her sexy slender figure.

Jeannette added: 'We all know that feeling of losing weight everywhere but where we want, particularly if you’re a typical British pear-shape.

'But the mushroom diet, just like the fungi itself, means you keep the weight where you want it up top and shed pounds where you don’t down below!

 'Well there is no denying that mushrooms are a powerhouse of nutritional benefits'

'It’ll be of no surprise that female celebrities will be looking more svelte than normal and I can exclusively reveal that mushrooms are the reason celebrities can look so good at the very last minute.'

Lucy Wyndham-Read, the USA Pro fitness and nutrition expert, said: 'Well there is no denying that mushrooms are a powerhouse of nutritional benefits and one of their greatest assets is that they are super Low GI.

'Plus, the fact that they are so very low in calories means, as part of a diet, they can help in weight loss. Plus mushrooms are super cheap, so this is a way to save pounds and drop the pounds.

'But it's untrue that mushrooms have the power to lose fat from everywhere except the bust! I carefully advise women not to expect this to happen and too much of a good thing is actually never a good thing.

'The fact is - if we eat a healthy, well-balanced, clean, natural diet and exercise regularly, we can all lose weight.'
