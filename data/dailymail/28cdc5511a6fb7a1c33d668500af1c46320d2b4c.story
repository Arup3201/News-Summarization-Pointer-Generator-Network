The New York City taxi cab driver involved in the crash that caused a British tourist to lose her leg on Tuesday, took the unusual step of holding a press conference outside the hospital she is recovering in and pointed the finger of blame at the cyclist he had been arguing with moments before the accident.

Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon, 24, was unafraid of defending his role in the horror smash and told the gathered reporters outside Bellevue Hospital today in Manhattan's Kips Bay that 'It's not my fault, it's just accident.' (sic).

Appearing to be nervous, Himon said that the crash outside the Rockefeller Center, in which 23-year-old Sian Green lost her foot, was caused when he accelerated away from cyclist Kenneth Olivo because he was afraid that he was going to be attacked.

Solidarity: Alongside Himon was Fernando Mateo, the president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers

Alongside Himon was Fernando Mateo, the president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers.

Speaking on the same day that the Taxi and Limousine Commission suspended Himon's license for 30 days, Mateo said that the real culprit is Olivio, who has been arrested 22 times.

'We have a situation where a messenger attacked his vehicle -- attacked it from the back and attacked it from the side and then tried to pass him. He was nervous, he was afraid like any of us would be,' said Mateo.

'He's a criminal, he's been arrested 22 times, he has an arrest sheet of 22 arrests. Now, who do you believe?'

Offering his sincere condolences to the family of Green, who only arrived in New York on Monday, Himon said that he will never forget the crash.

Blame Game: Himon says that Kenneth Olivo was physically threatening him moments before the smash and that caused him to accelerate away out of fear - ultimately causing the horrific accident

'Actually I very, very sorry about that. I always pray for her and her family. If I do something, I'm going to do for her, I'm going to always pray for her. I wish her good luck,' Himon said according to Eyewitness 7 in New York.

Indeed, Olivio, the cyclist involved in the horror New York City taxi crash that saw a a British tourist’s leg severed by a cab driver's vehicle once threatened to decapitate another man, it was revealed today.

Kenneth Olivo, 40, of Manhattan, spent 10 days in jail after pleading guilty in April to menacing after accidentally kicking a dog and then telling the owner's friend that he would 'kill you and your family'.

He also has been arrested at least 24 times in the past - but has not been charged over the incident that saw driver Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon injure part-time model Sian Green, 24, on Tuesday.

The 24-year-old cabbie was not licensed to drive the cab he was using and was originally said to have been arguing with a cyclist when he tried to step on the brake but hit the accelerator instead.

However, he told the New York Post: ‘He was in my way and I got upset, so I gave him notice that I wanted to pass through. He started pounding on my car with his hands and was yelling things at me.

‘I suddenly felt like I had to get out of there. It was becoming a bad situation. So I accelerated to get in front of him. I don’t know how, but I just lost control of the car. I was in shock. 

‘When I crashed, I didn’t even see the lady. At first, I didn’t think I hit anyone, then I saw her foot by my car... I need a more suitable job. There’s too much stress when you’re driving in the city.’

Initial action has been taken by the Taxi and Limousine Commission to suspend his licence, and although he only got a summons after the accident, he could eventually be given felony charges.

On holiday: Sian Green, right, is now beginning rehab and has left the intensive care unit after her leg was severed when a taxi mounted the pavement in Manhattan, New York City, last month. She was eating a hot dog dog with friend Keshia Warren, left, on the first day of their holiday

The car mounted the pavement before careering into Miss Green - who was eating a hot dog with her best friend Keshia Warren.

Miss Warren wept as she desperately tried to stem the flow of blood from Miss Green’s legs with a passer-by’s dog leash.

A plumber, David Justino, used his belt to make a life-saving tourniquet while a pizza truck owner raced to put her severed foot on ice.

And US celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, better known as Dr Oz, rushed to help from his nearby studio when he heard the crash.

Miss Green – who said she was determined not to let the injuries ruin her life - was taken to Bellevue Hospital in New York where she is now recovering after surgery.

Mr Justino, 44, said Miss Green was a ‘strong girl, a brave girl’.

‘From the shin down, it was gone,’ he added. ‘He hit the girl, she flew up in the air.

‘Her left leg was severed, the other was mangled. So I just grabbed my belt, went over, lifted her up, put it on, held it. She was conscious the whole time, the poor thing. I wished she had passed out.’

Last night, Miss Green’s parents Jason and Sonia said their daughter was ‘being very strong’ as she started to come to terms with what had happened.

At their semi-detached family home in Leicester, locksmith Mr Green, 42, said:  ‘She is in recovery now and they have had to amputate what’s left of her foot.

They have now flown to New York along with Miss Green’s boyfriend William Lord.

His father William Donaghue revealed that Miss Green had managed to speak to her boyfriend on the phone following the accident.

‘Sian is as upbeat as you can be about this,’ he said. ‘She is determined to not let this ruin her life. It’s such a tragic thing.’

Miss Green’s aunt Hayley Bennett added: ‘It’s just so terrible. The family’s grief-stricken,’ and her sister Rebecca, a model, said: ‘It’s such a shock. We’re devastated. What happened is awful but thankfully she’s in good hands.’

Miss Green, who has a degree in fashion 
buying from De Montfort University, worked at Hugo Boss  in Leicester. 
She was also in the running to become Miss Leicester.

Last year in her application to a beauty contest, 5ft 5in Miss Green wrote in the 'talents' section: ‘I have danced since the age of 10 and joined a dancing agency at the age of 16.

'With the agency I was also taught how to stilt walk which I really enjoy. I'm also trying to set up a modelling career.’

She added: ‘I consider myself a very creative person, so my ambition is to have my own line of underwear, which I am currently designing for.'

Her manager at Hugo Boss, Paul Richards, said: ‘She’s a lovely girl and we’re all devastated here.’

Police in New York are looking into the incident but have not yet brought any formal charges.

Himon is originally from Bangladesh but now lives in the Bronx. The New York Post also revealed that the taxi driver injured a passenger in a crash in 2010, which was the first year he worked as a taxi driver in the city.

Later that year he was also fined $50 (£32), before getting nine points and $415 (£266) in fines for three violations in 2011. He ran a red light, did 65 in a 45mph zone and performed an illegal turn.
