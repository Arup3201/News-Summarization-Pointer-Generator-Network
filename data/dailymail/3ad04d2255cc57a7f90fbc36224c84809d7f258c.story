Louise Blackwell QC, defending Bill Roache (pictured), poured scorn on the idea that the actor turned from 'perfect gentleman' to a sexual predator and back again, she told the jury

The ‘spectre’ of Jimmy Savile and an unhealthy interest in sending celebrities to court for sex offences is haunting the trial of  William Roache, his defence counsel claimed yesterday.

A ‘crisis of confidence’ following the exposure of Savile’s abuse explained why the allegations against the 81-year-old actor had been brought to court over alleged sex offences regardless of ‘worrying inconsistencies’ in his accusers’ accounts, a jury was told.

But now the ‘buck stops’ with them and it is their duty to see ‘reason and fairness’ prevail and acquit Roache on all counts, his barrister argued.

The prosecution has claimed Roache – who has played Ken Barlow in Coronation Street  since its launch – should be judged as the sex-obsessed ‘heart-throb’ he was in the 1960s and early 1970s when he allegedly targeted young girls, not the ‘lovely chap’ he is today.

However Louise Blackwell, QC, representing the twice-married father-of-four, ridiculed the idea that the ‘perfect gentleman’ had once been a ‘risk-taking predator’.

‘How do you hide that and completely stop it for the next 42 years from 1972?’ she asked. ‘Well, you don’t.’

Giving her closing speech at Preston 
Crown Court yesterday, Miss Blackwell told jurors ‘the spectre of Jimmy 
Savile hangs over this case’, saying it had ‘infected’ the trial.

Roache, pictured arriving at court today with his family, is accused of using his fame and popularity to exploit 'starstruck' youngsters in the late 60s and early 70s

Roache denies all the charges and has told the jury at Preston Crown Court he has no knowledge of any of the women he is supposed to have assaulted

Ms Blackwell reminded the jury of the glowing testimonies given about the defendant by his co-stars, Ann Kirkbride, who plays his on-screen wife Deirdre Barlow, and Helen Worth, also known as Gail Platt

‘Jimmy Savile is like an elephant in the room,’ she went on. ‘You can’t ignore it.’

Miss
 Blackwell said the entire investigation into the allegations against 
Roache showed ‘an unhealthy interest in the concept of celebrity’.

‘We
 say everything in this case suggests that when allegations are made 
against a celebrity, the Jimmy Savile crisis of conscience means that a 
fair investigation does not take place.’

She
 insisted there were damning inconsistencies in the women’s accounts. 
She said the first woman to come forward and accuse Roache of raping her
 and taking her virginity was unsure how old she had been at the time.

Miss
 Blackwell said it was ‘just not possible’ for a woman not to remember 
when her first experience of sex happened when it allegedly involved a 
‘horrid’ rape by a famous actor.

‘It totally lacks sense and credibility,’ she said.

Miss
 Blackwell also highlighted Roache’s evidence that he didn’t own a 
gold-coloured Rolls-Royce – in which one of the attacks is said to have 
taken place – until almost 20 years later.

She
 said this was a ‘fundamental flaw’ in the case which showed the alleged
 victim and her sister – who is also a complainant – had ‘got their 
heads together’ before giving evidence.

Roache,
 from Wilmslow, Cheshire, denies two counts of rape and four counts of 
indecent assault against five girls aged 16 and under, saying he has no 
knowledge of any of the  alleged victims.

He has been found not guilty of a further count of indecent assault against one of the girls on the direction of the judge.

The trial continues.
