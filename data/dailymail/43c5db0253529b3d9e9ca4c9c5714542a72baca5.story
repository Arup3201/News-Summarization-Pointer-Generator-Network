A woman has admitted breaching an Asbo for keeping 100 dogs at her home - after being caught with another 45.

Police seized 80 dogs from Diana Curtis in April last year and ordered her not to keep more than 14 pets in future. 

But magistrates heard that she now has 45 at her rural home after neighbours complained about the noise from the mixed-breed pack.

Can't help herself: Diana Curtis, pictured with one of her dogs, has breached an Asbo given to her for keeping 100 canines at her Devon home

Curtis, 54, of Winscott Lawn, Peters Marland, Devon, admitted breaching her anti-social behaviour order, which had been made after Torridge District Council received complaints about the dogs barking.

The case has already cost the police £30,000 in vets' bills and kennelling fees.

Prosecutor Neil Lawson told magistrates in Barnstaple: 'Police visited the farm in March and June when only the 14 dogs were visible but by the end of the summer more noise disturbances were reported.'

When police visited at the end of the summer about 30 animals could be seen. By October, this had grown to 39 with some bitches visibly pregnant and several dogs appearing semi-feral.

Mr Lawson said: 'When the police questioned Ms Curtis about the dogs she said "I know I have too many but I just can't help myself".'

Zara Svensson, mitigating, said: 'The most important things in her life are her dogs.

'She said to me earlier: "I don't care what happens to me today, the care of the dogs is what matters."

Breach: North Devon Magistrates' Court (above) in Barnstable heard how police found dozens of dogs after being called by angry neighbours

Magistrate Robin Hagley said: 'It seems to us your concerns for animals, dogs in particular, has got you into more serious trouble.'

The court ordered all of the animals to be removed except 14, which will be left with Curtis until January 10, on the understanding that she will re-home them herself by that date. 

If they are still on the farm, police will have to remove eight of them. Curtis was also fined £150 for breaching the Asbo.

Torridge police Inspector Shaun Kenneally, who attended the hearing, said afterwards: 'We just don't have the money to spend on something like this and it is the taxpayers' money. This case has needed a lot of preparation from all agencies involved.'

At a time of year when animal charities can be overwhelmed, the dogs previously owned by Diana Curtis are costing two charities an average of £10 per day per dog.

The Dogs Trust took 32 dogs from her farm while the RSPCA took two.

The Dogs Trust has estimated, on the basis each animal will stay for an average of 38 days, it will cost the charity £365 per animal.

If this is taken as an average figure the Dogs Trust's expenditure on this one case could easily reach £12,000.

It is believed when 47 dogs were previously removed from the site last year the Dogs Trust incurred a cost of over £17,000.

A spokeswoman from the trust said: 'Some of the dogs have been taken to the trust's centre at Ilfracombe and others have been taken up to Evesham, Worcestershire.

All the dogs from the last seizure have now been re-homed by the trust.

But the trust is unable to say how well the re-homing process will go this time as many of the animals need to become used to being in a house, which can take an indefinite amount of time for the older dogs.

Speaking after her hearing Diana Curtis said: 'This is totally out of proportion - the dogs aren't that noisy.

'They may bark but not constantly.

'I've brought it on myself - but I haven't run anybody over I don't knock people about or grow cannabis.' She added she'd learned her lesson, saying 'I can't take anymore.'

Neighbour Mike Lamprey of Peters Marland parish council said enough was enough.

'Dogs should be around humans in small numbers - not in large numbers like this - then the pack instinct takes over. The law must not be made a mockery of.'
