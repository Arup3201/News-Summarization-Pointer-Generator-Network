Lord Dannatt, the ex-Chief of the General Staff, says that society could learn lessons from the military

Britain has lost its ‘moral compass’ and should look to the conduct of the Armed Forces to instill proper standards of decency, the former head of the Army argues today.

A series of scandals that have rocked the country are evidence people in the UK are struggling to differentiate between right and wrong, warns General Lord Richard Dannatt.

They include MPs shamelessly milking their 
taxpayer-funded expenses, phone hacking, bankers paying themselves 
obscene bonuses and the summer riots, he will explain.

But in a lecture tonight Lord Dannatt, the ex-Chief of the General Staff, says that society could learn lessons from the military.

He says the Armed Forces today place as much importance on teaching recruits moral and mental strength as it does on physical training.

He says: ‘In past generations, it was often assumed that young men and women coming into the Armed Forces would have absorbed an understanding of the core values and standards of behaviour required by the military from their family or from within their wider community… I would suggest such a presumption cannot be made today.

‘Given that much of our society is pretty unstructured these days, and given that the military has the unique opportunity to educate its own into the importance of a proper moral understanding, then perhaps the military community may have a wider contribution that it can make to the nation.’

Lord Dannatt’s remarks will spark controversy because the Army has recently been blasted for abusing prisoners in Iraq.

'In past generations, it was 
often assumed that young men and women coming into the Armed Forces 
would have absorbed an understanding of the core values and standards of
behaviour required by the military from their family or from within 
their wider community… I would suggest such a presumption cannot be made
today'

Sir William Gage’s inquiry into the death of hotel receptionist Baha Mousa, who suffered more than 90 injuries after he was arrested as a terror suspect by British troops in Basra in 2003, found he had been beaten and tortured.

The British Army insists the abuse was not endemic and merely a case of a handful of rogue soldiers.

Lord Dannatt, speaking at the social think-tank Theos’ Annual Lecture tonight, will call these cases 'unforgivable' and say: 'All our soldiers must know that collectively and individually, we can, and should, and will be called to account when things go wrong.'

He will say that the moral and even the spiritual dimensions are as crucial as the strategic and operational dimensions of warfare, and essential for winning wars.

Moral training can make it possible for soldiers to show loyalty and integrity, and even to 'kill and show compassion at the same time,’ he will say.

General Lord Dannatt will argue that leaders both in the army and across society need a better understanding of the moral and spiritual dimension to both war and all of life.

Elizabeth Hunter, director of Theos, said: 'Following moral scandals across politics, journalism and banking, and the shock of the summer riots, Lord Dannatt is offering a way forward for rebuilding a society based on values and virtues.'
