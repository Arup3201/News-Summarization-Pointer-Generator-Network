It used to be the heart of any family home.

But kitchens are shrinking as the appetite for eating out grows.

The average Londoner now eats out nearly four times a week, copying a trend established by New Yorkers, according to the latest Zagat survey of restaurants in the capital.

It used to be the heart of any family home. But kitchens are shrinking as the appetite for eating out grows

Today an exclusive report, from the estate agency, Marsh & Parsons reveals how the eating out trend is influencing the size of people’s kitchens, also being cut back by the crippling cost of property in the capital.

Overall, it estimates the average kitchen has shrunk by a third since the 1960s, a time when families traditionally ate at home and prepared each meal themselves from scratch.

The report says the kitchen is ‘shrinking dramatically in size and prominence’ in London homes, claiming it is ‘falling victim to the changing eating habits of modern-day Londoners.’

In fact, the kitchen accounts for a smaller proportion of the total living space in new-build developments and conversions in the capital than ever before.

Charles Holland, a director of Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘Kitchen size is no longer as important to many young professional buyers.

‘It is often at the bottom of the pile in their property wish list.’

He added: ‘Aware of the changing lifestyle of our capital’s young professionals, developers of the latest London apartment blocks are prioritising living space, bathrooms and nearly all else over kitchen size.’

It recently sold a two-bedroom flat in a development in Barnes, south-west London, with a kitchen which is roughly half the size of an average car parking space.

For some homeowners, it is because their property is so small that there is no room for anything other than a very compact kitchen.

The average size of new-build one bedroom home in the UK is just 46 square metres, the size of one Jubilee Line carriage on the London Underground, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects.

A recent investigation by the institute found many families have no space to store large supermarket shops, particularly if they bought promotions, such as buy-one-get-one-free.

One woman said: ‘I buy lots of stuff in Tesco. If it is buy-one-get-one free crisps, then we just leave it in the car.’ Others used their garage or loft, rather than their cramped kitchen.

For others with larger homes, the kitchen is no longer a separate room, but part of a larger living space, often billed by estate agents as a ‘family living area’.

One flat in Pimlico, also in south-west London, was recently sold for £895,000 with a small galley kitchen squeezed into the corner of a huge living room.

Peter Rollings, chief executive of Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘With less and less time spent preparing meals in the home, we are starting to see the kitchen completely disappear as a room in its own right.‘It is being subsumed into the wider living and dining space.

‘Looking to the future, it begs the question whether the London kitchen is about to do a disappearing act on us altogether, or whether it has already ceased to exist as a must-have space?’

Companies now sell ‘hideaway’ kitchens which look like a piece of furniture, but open up to reveal all that you need for a basic kitchen. Others are just ‘mini’ kitchens which take up a tiny amount of space.

One firm, called John Strand, sells a one-metre wide ‘hideaway kitchen’ with a sink, a drainage area, a fridge and freezer, some storage shelves and a microwave.

Calvin Reeves, managing director of John Strand, said his company’s ‘mini’ or ‘hideaway’ kitchens have become increasingly popular in recent years.

Mr Reeves said: ‘In central London, property developers are converting more and more properties into studios and one-bedroom apartments.

‘This is because the way that people are living now - it is more about getting their food conveniently, rather than having the time to prepare it themselves.’

It is not just young professional couples who find their kitchens appealing, but also parents who want to make a room in their home into a ‘self-contained’ space where their grown-up child or elderly parent can live and enjoy some independence..
