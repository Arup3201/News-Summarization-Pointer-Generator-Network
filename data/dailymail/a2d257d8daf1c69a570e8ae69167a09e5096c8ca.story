Trying desperately to salvage 
anything that remains of his personal belongings, a man hangs from the 
shattered remnants of his waterfront home in the coastal village of Navotas, north of Manila in the Philippines.

And, while it might not be immediately obvious, he is one of the lucky ones.

Typhoon Nesat totally wiped away most
of his neighbours' homes as it ravaged the northern Philippines 
yesterday, with sustained wind speeds reaching more than 120mph, and 
rain producing the worst flooding in decades.

Blown away: A Filipino man hangs from the floor of his waterfront home in Navotas, north of Manila. Typhoon Nesat destroyed homes in the coastal village, and left 35 dead and a further 45 missing across the country

Nesat left death and destruction in its wake, with 41 dead and scores more injured. A further 45 people remain missing.

Now residents of southern China are 
bracing for impact as Nesat bears down upon them and promises a rough 
ride today and tonight.

Floodwaters were receding in most 
places, and emergency services had restored electricity in many places 
that experienced power cuts. But low-lying communities
in the north remained in crisis.

Rescue: A Filipino emergency services member carries a baby to safety as a family is evacuated from their flooded home in Isabela province. Many other victims remain stranded on the roofs of their homes as rescuers struggle to reach them

Chest deep: The worst flooding in decades has brought havoc to the Philippines. The death toll has risen today from 35 to 41, and many more remain missing

Mayor Santiago Austria, of the rice-farming town of Jaen in Nueva Ecija 
province, said: 'Many people here are still on top of their houses. We don't have enough
boats to reach them and hand them food.'

In all, nearly 500,000 people were affected by the typhoon in the Philippines, of which about 170,000 were forced to flee their 
homes and were in various evacuation centres.

Meanwhile, a new tropical storm was brewing in the Pacific, Philippine 
government forecaster Bobby Javier said.

Bearing down: Palm trees show the severity of sustained winds in Sanya, in south China's Hainan province. Despite bypassing Hong Kong, the typhoon caused flight diversions, a suspension of the stock exchange and closures of schools and businesses

Storm damage: No fatalities have yet been reported in China, but high 
winds have brought down trees and power lines, causing damage 
and widespread power cuts

He added that Tropical Storm Nalgae already had 
sustained winds of 52mph and gusts up to 62mph, and 
was expected to strengthen significantly before hitting major parts of 
the country in the next few days.

The typhoon made landfall on the eastern tip of China's Hainan island, closing schools, suspending ferry services and forcing fishing boats into safe shelter.

In Hong Kong, the stock market suspended trading, and shops and businesses closed fearful that it would strike land there.

The Asian financial centre's normally bustling streets were eerily quiet, with few people venturing outside to brave the rain and fierce winds.

At Hong Kong's airport, 245 flights were delayed, 20 were cancelled and 22 diverted to other airports.

Yet the typhoon did not hit Hong Kong directly, coming within 220 miles before moving away, the Hong Kong Observatory said.

Nevertheless two people were injured when bamboo 
scaffolding was blown over and collapsed onto a taxi, while another man was 
injured by a falling tree.

A barge ripped 
free from its moorings in the rough seas and slammed into a seawall on Hong 
Kong Island, forcing some nearby apartments to be evacuated.
