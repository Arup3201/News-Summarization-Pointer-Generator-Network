A former BHP Billiton Limited steel worker has won a landmark court case against the mining giant which was ordered to pay their former employee more than $2.2 million in compensation after exposing him to asbestos dust.

Currently bed-bound and suffering from depression, Steven Dunning from Cessnock, New South Wales, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, after being exposed to the fatal substance while working at the blast furnaces at Newcastle Steelworks from the age of 19 in December 1979 until 1981.

'I cannot begin to explain the devastation we felt on the day we were told he had this terminal illness,' Mr Dunning's wife, Roma said.

After a four year court battle, BHP Billiton Limited was ordered to pay Steven Dunning (pictured) over $2.2 million dollars for negligently exposing him to asbestos dust

'We are trying to make the most of every day even though Steven is still very sick and unable to do most of the things he used to enjoy.

'It is a daily struggle knowing that I will not have my loving husband to grow old with and that he will never meet his grandchildren and his life will be cut so short. We never expected this to happen.'

The trial heard how the cancer and radiotherapy Mr Dunning received, changed him from a 'happy go lucky, try anything, take this piss out of you' man, to someone plagued with night-sweats, lacking energy and motivation and suffering from a range of physical side-effects including, burns and vomiting.

'When things remind him of the mesotheliomaâ€¦they trigger uncontrollable shaking,' The court papers state.

'When Mrs Dunning asks him what's going on in his head "He would say he wants to be here longer, to be with his family, but he is so scared that the meso is going to come back very soon and kill him, at such a young age".'

The 54-year-old was diagnosed with terminal mesothelioma as a result of his exposure between the years 1979-1981, when he worked at the company's Newcastle Steelworks

After a brutal four year court battle in which BHP argued 'every available legal point', the company was ordered to pay the 54-year-old $2,236,959.57 in damages.

'Mr Dunning was only 50 when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma and he has not been able to work since then,' Joanne Wade, a solicitor from Slater and Gordon told Daily Mail Australia.

'He had intended to work until 70-years-old, so part of the judgement includes his loss of earning capacity.'

'It's a landmark decision in New South Wales because the damages awarded are the highest ever awarded in the Dust Diseases Tribunal of NSW and the first time that BHP has been ordered by the tribunal to pay financial compensation to a former employee from Newcastle Steelworks who was exposed to asbestos.'

BHP is expected to appeal the decision which Slater and Gordon solicitor, Joanne Wade, called a 'landmark' win

The trial revealed that BHP were aware of the large quantity of asbestos at the steelworks and understood the fatal consequences it presented to its workers - even in small amounts - and yet the material continued to be used right up until 1985.

Although BHP has shown signs that they will pursue an appeal - postponing the payment date for at least 28 days - Ms Wade said that the case has set a precedent and is likely to instill confidence in other former employees who were also negligently exposed to asbestos while working at Newcastle Steelworks.

'Once the judgment came down, BHP's lawyers immediately requested a stay on paying the money and indicated they were considering an appeal,' Ms Wade said.

'We do expect more people to come forward because the average latency period for exposure to asbestos and contracting the illness is 40 years, so if they were still using asbestos products into the mid 1980s then we expect more people to come forward with illnesses right up until the 2020s.'
