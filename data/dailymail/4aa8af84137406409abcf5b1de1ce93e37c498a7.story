Death: Robert Goold, 69, pictured when he was on the Liverpool Care Pathway before his death

A hospital which put an elderly patient on a controversial end of life 'pathway' without telling his family was criticised by a coroner yesterday.

Robert Goold, 69, was taken to hospital after a fall down the stairs left him with a fractured neck, back and skull and bleeding on the brain.

The pensioner, who was diagnosed with dementia in 2009, was taken to Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertforshire, and then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

After two weeks there doctors made the decision to place him on the Liverpool Care Pathway - without informing his family.

His daughter Susan Phillips, 50, said her father was then left to slowly deteriorate for a week without food, water or oxygen before he died.

She claimed after six days on the pathway a nurse offered to reverse the programme but it was too late.

Mr Goold, from Stevenage, was in Addenbrooke's for two weeks before he was put on the LCP on February 17.

His family were told his prognosis was not good and medics wanted to remove his ventilator to see how he responded.

Susan said the family believed removing his ventilation would give her father the 'best chance' of survival.

But a day later she went to the hospital to find her father flailing about trying to breathe with 'sheer terror in his eyes' and then discovered he had been placed on LCP without her permission.

He died on February 25 without being able to say goodbye to his wife of 51 years because she was too traumatised.

Susan said doctors and nurses could not explain to her why her father had been put on the LCP because nothing had been recorded in his notes.

The inquest, at Huntingdon Coroner's Court, Cambridgeshire, heard that Mr Goold died from bronchopneumonia, a head injury from his fall and a pulmonary thromboembolism with Alzheimer's, rather than because he was on the pathway.

Coroner David Morris said Mr Goold, from Stevenage, had been given 'appropriate symptomatic relief' and the hospital was not at fault over his death.

The coroner described the decision to put Mr Goold on the LCP as a 'valid clinical decision'.

But he said the 'breakdown of liaison and engagement with his family are matters of justifiable concern.'

And he added that 'lessons should and indeed have been learnt from Mr Goold's death.'

Charlotte Skouby, a lawyer who represented the Goold family at the inquest, said the relatives are 'considering their options' over potential legal action against the hospital.

Inquest: The hearing was told staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, pictured, were justified in putting the 69-year-old on the end-of-life plan but there were concerns over the fact they did not tell his family

She said: 'This is an incredibly sad case of a family being denied the opportunity to be involved in end of life care decisions concerning a much loved husband, father and grandfather.

'The Coroner was clearly critical of the Trust for the shortcomings of their end of life care consultation process, which caused Mr Goold's family great undue distress.

'Whilst the Liverpool Care Pathway has now been phased out, NHS Trust and unit specific end of life care pathways are still in operation, meaning that this remains very much a real issue for patients and their families.'

The LCP, designed by the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's Marie Curie Hospice, aimed to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person's life.

Doctors can withdraw fluids and drugs from patients or be put on continuous sedation if they are deemed close to death.

Phased out: The hospital used the care pathway 252 times in the first seven months of last year

But the plan has been criticised by some experts and presented as a cost-cutting way to bring about the premature deaths of elderly patients.

The government decided in July last year to end the LCP but in December there were reports it was simply being rebranded and not abolished.

A Cambridge University Hospitals spokesman said: 'We recognise that although we did have discussions with the family we could have communicated more effectively, and we apologise to them for that.

'We have since changed our processes in terms of next of kin communication in these difficult situations.

'We offer our condolences to Mr Goold's family and we appreciate that this must be a very difficult and upsetting time for them.'

Addenbrooke's used the controversial pathway 252 times between January last year and July, when the government announced it would be phased out.

Since July last year it has not been used once, a hospital spokesman told MailOnline.
