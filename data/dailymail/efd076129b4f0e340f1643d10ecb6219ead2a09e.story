Kansas City Royals gold glove first baseman Eric Hosmer had a line drive go through his glove during a game this week.

Hosmer was in position during the seventh inning of Wednesday night’s game against Tampa Bay to catch the liner off the bat of Rays outfielder Kevin Kiermaier, but the ball had other ideas.

Kiermaier hit the ball so hard it went right through the webbing of the normally reliable Hosmer’s mitt, and left the first baseman dumbfounded.

Routine play: A line drive right at Hosmer is an out 99 out of 100 times

Not so much: The ball was hit so hard it went through Hosmer's glove

The play started like a normal line drive. Hosmer was there to make the easy putout – only he wasn’t.

Slow motion replay shows the screaming liner going into, through and out of the webbing of Hosmer’s glove.

Royals second baseman was backing Hosmer up, scrambled to his left to field the ball – bouncing by the time it reached him – and tossed it to Hosmer at first base for the out.

A dumbfounded Hosmer looked at his glove after the out was recorded and started tugging at the laces.

It was almost as if he expected to find a hole in the webbing.

Hosmer won the 2013 Gold Glove Award as the American League's best defensive first baseman.

Kiermaier’s scorching line drive had no effect on the outcome of the game, but the Royals still lost 4-3.
