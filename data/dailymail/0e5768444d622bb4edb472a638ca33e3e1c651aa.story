A daredevil rode his dirt bike up a ramp before base jumping to the ground in a life-threatening stunt.

Incredible footage of the feat shows the rider driving his bike off the ramp-edge into the air at a high speed,

The bike then spirals through the air before the rider pushes himself off - pulling his chute as he falls.

Brad O'Neil from Washington, USA, was in the air for several seconds before plummeting with his bike into the lake below.

The awe-inspiring trick tested the 26-year-old's nerves as he launched his bike into the sky above a lake in Franklin, Texas.

The ramp was the biggest of its kind ever built at 60ft tall and 100ft long.

The rider said: 'I came up with the idea when I was 12 or 13 - I just thought it would be cool to ride a bike high enough to base jump from.'

He added:'I was just trying to make that fantasy a reality.

'I went to all the major action sports companies but it was really hard to get them to believe in it.

'I decided I would just have to do it myself - I learned everything I could to make it happen.

'Every time I do something big there is so much tying me down - an overwhelming fear.

'I find the things that your apprehensive about are usually the things that bring you the most joy.

'I live for creating those moments.'
