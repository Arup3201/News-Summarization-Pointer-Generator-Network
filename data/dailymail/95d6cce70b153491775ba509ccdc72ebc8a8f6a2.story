A D.C. woman has been assigned a medical guardian after making thousands of calls to 911 over three decades and being its most frequent user.

Superior Court Judge Erik P. Christian approved the move on Monday for Martha Rigsby, The Washington Post reports. Christian called Rigsby's calls a 'serial, excessive and unwarranted' burden on the city's emergency services.

It is thought to be the first case in which city officials have tried to limit a 911 user.

Rigbsy, 59, was known in the 1980s as 'Metro Martha,' the paper reports, because she frequently fell at D.C. Metro stations. She usually suffered seizures or fainting spells.

A fire department official told the paper in November 2013 that Rigsby was linked to at least 226 calls to 911 and 117 ambulance trips in the past twelve months.

According to that report, Rigsby owes $61,366.33 to D.C. Fire and EMS for ambulance rides. Each trip in the past five years averaged $478.

Since then, she has taken approximately 30 ambulance trips.

Rigsby and other frequent 911 users are often nicknamed 'frequent fliers.'

Rigsby fell in a courthouse less than minute before her case was to begin in January, the paper reports. She said that she tripped on her cane.

Firefighters who responded allegedly knew Rigbsy and called her by her first name.

District witness Abayomi Jaji, a psychiatrist with the Department of Behavioral Health, said Rigsby could not care for herself because of bipolar and borderline personality disorder, plus conversion disorder.

Christian's ruling, however, noted that Rigbsy can take of herself in many ways. She pays bills, bathes and dresses herself, and is able to arrange rides to medical appointments, the paper says.

Rigsby's guardianship allows oversight for her medical decisions but not legal or financial affairs. The guardian will reportedly be able to recommend a home aid and arrange medical appointments. Private insurance will likely Rigsby's expenses.
