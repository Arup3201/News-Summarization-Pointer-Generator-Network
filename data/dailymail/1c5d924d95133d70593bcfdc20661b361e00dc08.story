His world record-breaking biceps have earned him the nickname 'the real-life Popeye' - but giant bodybuilder Moustafa Ismail is actually allergic to spinach.

Unlike the famous cartoon sailor, who gets his strength from the iron-rich plant, 'Big Mo' cannot stand the greenery.

The 24-year-old Egyptian, whose 31-inch biceps measure the same as a man's waist, says spinach is to him what kryptonite is to Superman.

Record-breaker: Unlike the cartoon sailor, 'the real-life Popeye' Moustafa Ismail is actually allergic to spinach

Weakness: The muscleman said the iron-rich plant is to him what kryptonite is to Superman

International recognition: Big Mo's incredible physique has earned him dozens of trips around the world

Mr Ismail, who entered the Guinness World Book of Records last year as the man with the world's largest biceps, added: 'I like chicken and beef - anything but spinach.'

The bodybuilder is the toast of his hometown Alexandria, which he left to move to America in 2007 to find better gym equipment.

He said he was fat as a child growing up in the Middle East but had returned home as 'the Hulk'.

Mr Ismail, who lives with his wife Carolina, 30, in the U.S., said: 'I'm the first Egyptian in the Guinness book. In Egypt they had a celebration for me and my family - they were so proud.'

Eye-catching: The bodybuilder is stopped wherever he goes by people  wanting to feel his arms

Give me strength: The Egyptian can lift 600lbs, the same weight as an average-sized grizzly bear

Critics: Some claim Mr Ismail is a fake and accuse him of using steroids, implants or synthol

His incredible physique has earned him dozens of trips to countries around the world, including the UK.

He is stopped wherever he goes by men and women wanting to feel his arms and said that some of his admirers tell him his body motivates them to workout - while others have even said he inspired them to 'get off drugs'.

However, he has had his critics too, with some claiming his muscles are fake and accusing him of using steroids, implants or synthol - a synthetic oil used by bodybuilders to fluff their muscles.

But 'Big Mo', who can lift 600lbs, the same weight as an average-sized grizzly bear, denies cheating.

He even underwent an ultrasound on Japanese TV to prove his biceps are real, and added: 'It is hurtful. I'm proud of myself.'

Growing boy: His daily diets includes 7lb of meat, 9lb of carbohydrates and three gallons of water

Hard work: The three-hour workouts centre around cardio, strength training and body sculpting

Despite the attention, Mr Ismail 
keeps his feet firmly on the ground and still works 70-hours a week as 
an assistant manager at a gas station in Milford, Massachusetts.

When he is not working he can be found in the gym sweating through a ferocious training regime.

Mr Muscles: Big Mo does plenty of bicep curls

His three-hour workouts begin at 5am and centre around cardio, strength training and body sculpting - plus lots of bicep curls.

'It's not about me lifting heavy weights,' said Mo, who worshipped Hollywood musclemen like Arnold Schwarzenegger as a teenager.

'It's about me making the right techniques, even with the light weights, but getting good results out of that.'

Mr Ismail eats 7lb of meat, 9lb of carbohydrates and three gallons of water every day, and washes it all down with three protein shakes.

The gym buff has come a long way since his youth when he was embarrassed by his body.

He said: 'Before I started working out I was fat - I was always shy to take my shirt off. Every time my mother told me to go to the swimming pool I'd wear a t-shirt'Â 

But Mr Ismail is not content with his world record. He aims to add eight more inches to his biceps - taking them to an incredible 40-ins.

He also has plans to make his shoulders even bigger than his biceps. 'I will try but I need to put in a lot more effort. You have to focus mentally and prepare yourself,' he said.

'To reach that level you have to believe in yourself. I can do it if I will just keep pushing, keep on working out. Maybe it will take a year to reach that goal.'

The Egyptian Popeye says there is only one downside: 'I will look scary.'
