The former president of The George Washington University is under fire after making controversial statements on the nature of sexual assault.

Dr Stephen Joel Trachtenberg made the comments in a Tuesday taping of the Diane Rehm Show, during a panel about Greek Life at U.S. Colleges.

When the conversation turns to the reports of sexual misconduct by fraternities, Trachtenberg blames binge-drinking.

'Without making the victims responsible for what happens, one of the groups that have to be trained not to drink in excess are women,' Trachtenberg said.

Victim blaming? Dr Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, president emeritus of The George Washington University, spoke on the Diane Rehm show on Tuesday, saying sexual assault could be prevented if women drank less

'They need to be in the position to punch the guys in the nose if they misbehave.

'And so part of the problem is that you have men who take advantage of women who drink too much and there are women who drink too much. And we need to educate our daughters and our children in that regard,' Trachtenberg said

Following the show, George Washington University students flooded Twitter expressing their outrage at Trachtenberg for seemingly blaming the victims of sexual assault.

'[I don't know] what's more concerning, the devolution of rape to "misbehaving," or the idea that women are setting themselves up,' GW student Katie Bishop tweeted.

Even one of the university's professors called out Trachtenberg for his offensive comments.

Following the show, a flood of GWU students and teachers took to Twitter to express their frustrations with Trachtenberg's comments

Trachtenberg later qualified his statements, saying they were taken 'out of context' and that he doesn't believe responsibility shifts from the predator to the victim when the victim drinks too much. Above another tweet from a GWU student

'Hey, Trachtenberg: sober women are raped, too. The ones responsible are RAPISTS,' wrote Professor Katherine Howell, of the writing department.

Trachtenberg, currently serving as the university's professor of public service, later qualified some of his statements to the school newspaper, the GW Hatchet.

He said his statements were taken 'out of context'.

'I don't believe that because a woman drinks, that shifts responsibility from a predator to her. What I'm saying is you want to have somebody you care about like your daughter, granddaughter, or girlfriend to understand her limits because she will be less likely [able] to fight off somebody who is attacking her,' he said Wednesday.

Sexual assault has become a serious issue on university campuses nation-wide, with estimates that one in five women will be the victim or attempted or completed sex-assault while in college.

The federal government has launched an effort to compile better statistics on the issue and the Education Department is also investigating how 55 schools handled sexual assault complaints.
