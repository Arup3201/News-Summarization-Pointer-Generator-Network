A disgraced university dean on trial for using her students as personal servants was the prime suspect in the execution-style murder of her first husband, it has emerged.

Dr Cecilia Chang, 57, has been accused of embezzling more than $1 million from St John's University, where she worked as dean of the Asian Studies Center, and using students as her personal servants.

But it has now emerged that her first husband accused her of being responsible for his murder as he lay dying in hospital.

Disgraced: Dr Cecilia Chang, 57, has been accused of embezzling more than $1 million from St John's University. It has now emerged her dying husband accused her of being responsible for his murder

According to the New York Daily News, Ruey Fung Tsai — known as 'Johnson' - asked for a piece of paper from detectives as he lay in the intensive care unit at  Elmurst General Hospital after being shot three times in his back.

He was unable to talk because he had a tube running down this throat.

'He wrote that his wife was responsible: "My wife did this,’” a source told the newspaper.

It is also alleged that Tsai told detectives of Chang's business dealings with Donald Manes - a former Queens Borough President who committed suicide in 1986 amid a corruption scandal.

The murder of Tsai still remains unsolved. Detectives were unable to further question him about his claims before he died on July 31 in 1990.

He was shot as he arrived at his business premises in Bushwick, Brooklyn, 11 days earlier.

According to police records, after arriving at work at about 9.30am, a young Asian man walked up to him and opened fire.

'Servant': Peiyi Gan was worried she would lose her scholarship if she didn't comply with the dean's demands

The gunman did not take anything and fled into a nearby subway station.

Following the murder, Chang - then a rising star at St John's - was questioned as the prime suspect but said she did not know anything. Her home was even placed under surveillance.

But despite the claim of her husband, police were unable to link her to the murder.

When asked to comment on the claims, Chang, who has remarried twice, said: 'My lawyer says I am not supposed to answer any questions.'

A foreign exchange student at St John's University previously told a court that she was treated like a servant by Dr Chang - and said nothing because she feared her scholarship would be taken away.

Peiyi (Tracy) Gan, a Chinese national, did laundry, cooked and cleaned for Dr Chang.

Miss Gan said that she acted as a maid for Chang and her family at their home in Jamaica 
Estates, Queens, New York and often endured verbal abuse from Chang's son Steven. 

She was also required to hand-wash the disgraced university dean's underwear. 

Under the scholarship program at St John's, students are required to give 20-hours service to the school each week.

Miss Gan, now 31, had come to the U.S. to study in 2004 - and began working for Chang seven days a week.

She continued for four years until she had completed her Master's degree.

As well as taking out the trash and mopping floors, the young woman cooked for the family - who often insulted her meals.

Miss Gan was also forced to create 
fake financial statements allowing the disgraced dean to claim thousands
of dollars from the school, according to the New York Post.

In
2010, Chang was charged with forced labor after she allegedly told 
students they would lose their scholarships unless they worked for her.

Prosecutors
at the Brooklyn court said that Chang stole from the university to pay 
off gambling debts at casinos in Atlantic City and Connecticut.
