Who owns 620 dresses, 434 pairs of shoes, 310 skirts, 248 coats and an whopping 1,116 tops?

You do. But unlike Tamara Ecclestone, Imelda Marcos, Suri Cruise and Harper Beckham, you won't possess them all at once.

The average woman will own 372 cardigans and 558 pairs of trousers during her adult life, according to new research.

The average woman will, over her adult lifetime, own 434 pairs of shoes, according to mycelebrityfashion.co.uk

A recent study from British celebrity fashion website mycelebrityfashion.co.uk revealed how many items of clothing a woman is likely to go through between the ages of 18 and 80.

Surveying women aged over 18 around the UK, the website found the average number of each item of clothing a woman buys per year, with tops coming out on, er, top with 18 per year, dresses second at ten per year, and trousers and jeans coming third, with the average woman buying nine pairs every year.

Unless you are Harper Beckham, a woman is likely to go through seven pairs of shoes every year, six cardigans or jumpers, five skirts and four coats or jackets.

When taking into consideration the 
averages revealed by the respondents, as well as the fact that a woman's
adult lifetime is, on average, 62 years from the age of 18, it appears 
that women own on average, in a lifetime, 1,116 tops, 620 dresses, 310 skirts, 372 
cardigans/ jumpers, 558 trousers orjeans, 248 coats or jackets and 434 pair 
of shoes.

Most women will own 1,117 tops in a life time - probably far fewer than the number already owned by celebrity poppets Suri Cruise, left, and Harper Beckham, right

Over a quarter of the 
respondents (27 per cent), described their clothes shopping habits as 'impulsive', while 39 per cent admitted to buying 'in bulk' during sales.

Bobbie Malpass, editor of mycelebrityfashion.co.uk, commented: 'When looking at the bigger picture, 
you certainly would not imagine owning this many clothing items in your 
lifetime!

'It doesn't seem like a lot at the time, when you buy the odd 
dress or jacket, but when it's all put together you do realise the 
amount you accumulate! It would be quite interesting to find out how 
many different clothing items men buy in their lifetime and compare it 
to women.

The website polled 1,246 women across the UK.

How many pairs of shoes do you go through every year?
