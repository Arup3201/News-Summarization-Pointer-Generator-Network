The self-styled Iranian sheikh who has taken staff and customers hostage in a Sydney chocolate shop demanded police officers bring him an ISIS flag in a chilling phone call to a local radio station.

Man Haron Monis is understood to have forced one of his hostages to call 2GB radio host Ray Hadley and demand the terror group's black banner be brought to the Martin Place cafe, as well as requesting a personal phone call with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Mr Hadley initially refused to speak to him publicly urging him to talk to police instead. A short time later, however, the radio host went off air, apparently to talk to one of the hostages being used as a spokesperson by the gunman.

Monis' request for the flag came shortly after one of the hostages inside the cafe was seen with her hands placed on one of the windows and running her thumb across her throat. The hostages may have been directed to make the gesture by Monis.

Gunman: Self-styled Iranian sheikh Man Haron Monis demanded police officers bring him an ISIS flag in a chilling phone call to a local radio station.

Born Manteghi Bourjerdi, the extremist left Iran for Australia in 1996 and adopted various names before settling on Sheik Haron

Already well-known to police, Haron is currently on bail for more than 40 sexual offences relating to his work as a so-called spiritual healer

Not long after taking the café under siege at about 9.45am, Haron forced crying women to hold a black Islamic flag up to the window with the words 'there is no God but Allah' and 'Mohammed is the messenger of God' written in white writing.

That flag is a perfectly innocent and generic Islamic slogan, although it has been incorporated into the banner used by Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. 

One of the hostage-takers has made contact with officers saying that he has 'devices all over the city' and 'wants to speak with the prime minister live on radio', according to Ray Hadley, from 2GB.

Armed police have sealed off streets around the cafe and Martin Place station is shut. Planes have been diverted away from the city centre.

Lindt Australia CEO Steve Loane estimates there are up to 50 people being held.

Officials have also evacuated the Opera House after reports of a suspicious device.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the incident as 'deeply concerning'.

'This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner,' he said in a statement. 

At least three people could be seen holding their hands up inside the establishment, and an extremist flag was hanging in the window
