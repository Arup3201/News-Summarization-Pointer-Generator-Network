She's more frequently seen sporting airtex T-shirts, sensible skirts, crisp white caps and comfortable trainers.

And she's been wearing that outfit every day on the golfing green since she was just four years old.

But America's young female golfing sensation Michelle Wie swapped her usual attire for a stunning Matthew Williamson gown at an Olympics party at London's Omega House last night.

Attending the party with fellow golfer Jeehae Lee, from South Korea, 22-year-old Wie looked sensational in the embellished red and nude floor-length sleeveless dress, which featured elaborate asymmetrical detail, a high neckline and a racy, thigh-high slit.

The golfer - who has played the sport in her native Hawaii since she was just four years old, and became the youngest player ever to qualify for a United States Golf Association (USGA) amateur championship aged 10 - excitedly tweeted about her evening at Omega House.

Posting photos of herself and Lee on the social networking site, Wie wrote: 'This is inside one of the rooms at the house. @jeehaeda and I matching colors. Ha. How do we look?'

She also remarked: 'Another amazing night @omegawatches house in Soho. #London2012 I wore the most beautiful dress by Matthew Williamson.'

The recent Stanford graduate (Wie finished her degree in March, majoring in communications) proved she has grown into quite the beauty since she was a golfing prodigy of just 14, known around the world as the 'female Tiger Woods'.

The only child of South Korean parents who settled in America in the 1980s, Wie was born in Honolulu in 1989 and has only United States citizenship.

The golfer obviously inherited her mother's genes: Bo Wie was not only South Korea's women's amateur golf champion in 1985-6, but also competed in a Miss Korea pageant.

Michelle Wie began playing golf at the age of four and at the age of 11 won both the Hawaii State Women’s Stroke Play Championship and the Jennie K. Wilson Women’s Invitational, the oldest and most prestigious women’s amateur tournament in Hawaii.

She became a professional golfer at the age of 15 and signed sponsorship contracts with Nike
and Sony reportedly worth more than $10m per year.

Though their sport is not currently 
an Olympic even, the pair are in London supporting their country's 
athletes and getting an idea of what the Olympics is all about, since 
golf is due to be reinstated at the 2016 games in Brazil.

Wie and her South Korean golfing 
friend Lee were at Omega House on Greek Street in Soho, the watchmaker’s
official residence during the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Lee also tweeted a
photograph the day before of the pair before a party inside Tower 
Bridge, saying: 'Dinner at the tower bridge with @themichellewie and @omegawatches And we are literally IN the tower bridge.'

Historically, golf did featured in 
the Summer Olympic Games official programme in 1900 and 1904, and in 
2009 the IOC decided to bring the event back.

The event will feature professional golfers, many of whom have expressed interest in being allowed to compete in the games.
