A successful businessman who died when his super car ploughed into a bus was nearly three times the drink-dive limit, speeding and not wearing a seatbelt, an inquest heard.

Father-of-three Andrew Quinn, 39, was killed instantly when his white Audi R8 smashed head-on into an Arriva bus on Great North Road, in Gosforth, Newcastle.

It is believed that Mr Quinn, who was travelling northbound towards Gosforth High Street, was returning to the home he shared with his wife, Samantha, and children at the time of the accident.

Aftermath: The Audi R8 sports car driven by father-of-three Andrew Quinn at 72mph collided head on with the bus in Gosforth, Newcastle

An inquest into his death heard that Mr Quinn’s decision to get behind the wheel of his sports car after drinking alcohol was completely out of character.

His car was reported to be travelling at a speed of 72mph when it collided with the bus.

Mr Quinn was listed as a director of AJQ Consulting Limited at the time of his death on the evening of Sunday, October 21, last year.

The inquest was told that Mr Quinn had been out drinking with a friend in Jesmond on the afternoon before the crash.

It is believed he overtook a car while travelling southbound on Great North Road, close to where the speed limit changes from 50mph to 30mph.

Mr Quinn was pronounced dead at the scene following the collision on Gosforth High Street

A police investigation concluded that Mr Quinn had been unable to move back into his lane before colliding with the Arriva bus on the northbound carriageway.

The 61-year-old bus driver was injured in the collision, which destroyed the £90,000 sports car.

The bus was out-of-service and carried no passengers.

At the time of the accident Mr Quinn’s his father, Patrick, said: 'We are all devastated at this time.

'We just want to thank everyone for their kind words, all our friends and family.'

Neighbours also paid tribute. Suki Dhaliwal, 43, said: 'I still cannot believe he is gone.

'He was such a friendly man, always laughing and joking and with such a lovely wife and family.'

Coroner Karen Dilks said the collision was down to driver error but the outcome was wholly unintended. She recorded a verdict of accidental death.
