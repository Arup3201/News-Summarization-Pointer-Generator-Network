The top rate of tax will stay at 45p until the next election because Britain faces a descent into extremism if it diverts from its austerity drive, Nick Clegg said yesterday.

Making his keynote address at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton, he said there could be ‘no question’ of further reducing the income tax charged on earnings over £150,000.

Mr Clegg said any future cuts in taxation must pass ‘one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by?’

Standing firm: Making his keynote address at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton, Nick Clegg said there could be 'no question' of further reducing the income tax charged on earnings over £150,000

His intervention will dismay the Tory Right, who believe the top rate of tax – brought down from 50p earlier this year – should be returned to 40p to encourage the rich to come or remain in Britain.

Conservatives will, however, be cheered by Mr Clegg’s steadfast backing for the Government’s attempts to rein in public spending.

Britain must accept ‘further belt-tightening’ beyond the next election as expenditure is out of control, he suggested – pointing out the country is still borrowing £1billion every three days.

The Deputy Prime Minister even suggested state spending had ‘undermined’ Britain’s prosperity, pointing to the sevenfold increase in the welfare budget over the last 50 years while the economy grew only threefold. Mr Clegg said Labour had ‘plunged Britain into austerity’ by ‘crashing the economy and racking up record debts’.

Thoughts: Mr Clegg said any future cuts in taxation must pass 'one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by?'

He singled out Shadow Chancellor Ed 
Balls for particular criticism, accusing him of inhabiting a ‘fantasy 
world where there is no boom and bust and the money never runs out’.

The Deputy Prime Minister painted an 
apocalyptic picture of the potential consequences unless the West 
responds by dealing with its debts and tackling economic weaknesses.

‘Our influence in the world, our standard of living, our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance – all are in the balance,’ he said.

‘For power would move not only away from the liberal and democratic world, but within it too; from moderates to hardliners, from internationalists to isolationists, from those committed to the politics of co-operation to those hell-bent on confrontation.

‘If history has taught us anything, it is that extremists thrive in tough times. So to those who ask, incredulously, what we – the Liberal Democrats – are doing cutting public spending, I simply say this: Who suffers most when governments go bust? When they can no longer pay salaries, benefits and pensions? Not the bankers and the hedge fund managers, that’s for sure. No, it would be the poor, the old, the infirm – those with the least to fall back on.’

Mr Clegg cheered the party faithful – and
made clear his own determination to remain leader until the next 
election in 2015 – by unveiling his predecessor Lord Ashdown as the head
of his election campaign.

And he admitted that walking out of the 
Coalition was ‘an alluring prospect in some ways’. But he insisted there
could be no return for the Lib Dems to a ‘stop the world I want to get 
off party’ – a swipe at critics who want to veer to the left.

Earlier he had told opponents in the party that if they didn’t like him they should vote Labour.

Last night Treasury sources said Mr Osborne was ‘pretty relaxed’ about Mr Clegg’s declaration on the 45p tax rate. ‘This is Nick Clegg setting out the Liberal Democrat position,’ said one. ‘It is safe to say that cutting the 45p rate is not George’s priority.’
