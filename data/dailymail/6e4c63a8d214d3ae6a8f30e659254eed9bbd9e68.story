A gang of Eastern European Roma gipsies who have been terrorising residents, tourists and shopkeepers near Marble Arch were moved along by immigration officials in the early hours of this morning – but had already returned to the area by the afternoon.

Police, council officials and Home Office immigration staff successfully raided the area outside a plush Park Lane apartment block at around 2am, resulting in 14 of the gang agreeing to return home.

The group of rough sleepers have been congregating in the area for around two years and businesses in Park Lane - one of the richest areas of Mayfair - and Marble Arch have complained the gang constantly harass customers and staff and cause sanitation problems.

Police, council officials and Home Office immigration staff raided the area at around 2am, resulting in 14 of the gang agreeing to return home. However, by 2pm many of the group had returned

Locals claim many in the group are armed with walking sticks or crutches with knives on the bottom to slash open rubbish bags to check for anything of value before leaving the contents strewn all over the floor for the council to clean up.

Makeshift camps have been set up next to Marble Arch itself and the area is used as an outside toilet.

The gang have been sleeping outside the newsagents for around two years and arrive every night at 9pm before leaving at about 6am.

Despite today’s early morning raid, at least one person could be seen back begging at the spot less than 12 hours later – although nine people in the gang were issued with immigration papers which means they have 30 days to leave the area.

Local residents claim they are too scared to use their own front door due to the intimidating group of gipsies.

One 87-year-old resident got so fed up with having to clamber over bodies to get to her front door that she wrote to the Duke of Westminster to complain about it.

Police handed out a notice, left, to businesses on Park Lane today informing them of their plans to reduce the number of rough sleepers currently in the area. Despite 14 gipsies agreeing to leave the area in the early morning raid, at least one beggar, right, had returned by the afternoon to continue to harass passers-by

The prestigious address is home to Saudi Royalty as well as a prime minister's family, with the penthouse in the apartment block costing an estimated £25,000 a week to rent.

Chauffeur Patrick O'Toole, 54, said he has seen police move on the group about 12 times within the last two years.

He said: ‘We have to phone the council all the time about them.

‘As soon as people put their rubbish bags out they are tearing all the bags open, chucking rubbish everywhere.

‘In the evening residents are too frightened to use the front door if they see them outside.’

He says that men in the group have repeatedly tried the gold ring scam on him, in which you are approached by someone saying that you have dropped a gold ring on the floor.

They then produce a cheap brass ring with hallmarks on and say you should give them money because they have 'helped you find the ring'.

‘It's just gone berserk over the last two years,’ Mr O'Toole said. ‘It's happened to me four times in one week. It just really annoys me.

Nine people in the gang were issued with immigration papers in this morning's raid which means they have 30 days to leave the area

Police say they are working to build a case against some members of the gang so they can be issued with Anti-Social Behaviour Orders

‘I see them doing it to American tourists and I get out the car to warn them then they turn round looking like they are going to stab me. It's just not on.’

Police say they are working to build a case against some members of the gang so they can be issued with ASBOs.

Arif Islam, 30, who has been working in the newsagent near where the gang sleep, says the problem is made worse by Arab tourists who give them large amounts of money.

‘The Arab people help them a lot. Only yesterday one of them bought drinks and food for all of them.

They give the whole group £5 or £10 each. These people know what they are doing,’ Mr Islam said.

‘They pretend to have a problem with their leg but you see them later walking completely normally.

‘One of my neighbours told them to move and they urinated all over his shop. I'm too frightened to tell them anything.’

One street cleaner for Westminster Council, who did not want to be named, said his job had become almost impossible over the past two years since the group arrived.

The group were the target of a police and Home Office coordinated night-time raid with 14 of them arrested and a further nine told to leave within 30 days

‘They've made my job so much harder. I get complaints all the time that I haven't done my job but as soon as I clean it, they're back,’ he said.

‘I just can't keep up with them. They have walking sticks and crutches with knives on the end of them to cut open the bags and they just turn the stuff out onto the floor.

‘They are looking for things they can get money for, clothes and stuff. When I come round in the morning all the bags are open in the roads around here, everywhere you go there are open bags.’

A Met Police spokesperson said: ‘Neighbourhood policing teams in Westminster, in partnership with Westminster City Council and other agencies, have this morning broken up encampments of eastern European rough sleepers in Park Lane.

‘There are a number of individuals believed to be rough sleeping at Marble Arch that police are building evidence against for anti-social behaviours orders (ASBOs).

‘Home Office Immigration Enforcement, rough sleeping outreach workers and street cleansing teams have also been involved in today's operation, which has seen 14 rough sleepers agree to return home, while a further nine will be issued with immigration papers requiring them to leave within 30 days.

‘Immigration officers established whether they were exercising their treaty rights and Westminster City Council will clean up and deal will any detritus and sanitation issues.

‘This is in response to local complaints received from residents and the business community.

‘This is an ongoing issue. Whilst some very good progress is being made, this issue persists and all agencies are committed to dealing with this matter in a robust and proportionate fashion.’

From 1 January any illegal European immigrant removed or who voluntarily leaves the UK having been found to be staying illegally will be unable to re-enter the UK for 12 months if there's a chance of ‘abuse’ of the system.
