Seattle Seahawk's player Richard Sherman launched a live TV rant at his San Francisco 49ers rival Michael Crabtree yesterday after his team's dramatic victory.

The cornerback was interviewed by Fox's Erin Andrews minutes after preventing a game winning touchdown and securing his team's 23-17 victory.  

But in the post game interview Sherman accused Crabtree of belittling his abilities during the game.

He said: 'Well, I'm the best corner in the game. 
When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result 
you're gonna get .... Don't you [Crabtree] ever talk about me! Don't you
 open your mouth about the best or I'm gonna shut it for you real 
quick.'

'It's a small part of who I am': Richard Sherman said adrenaline and a long-standing grudge made him launch his attack on Michael Crabtree

Apparently, Crabtree said some comments about Sherman's playing abilities earlier in the game.

Sherman even got a penalty for making a two handed choking gesture directed at Crabtree.

Crabtree responded to Sherman's rant on Twitter by saying, 'Film don't lie... @nflnetwork @espn pull up the tape of that game and show me where this guy is the best? #fake #fake #fake'

Sherman remained unruffled and wrote,' There was a lot of talk before the game.... Now I'm the bad guy lol.... Well if u judge my character on the field ....So many glass houses.'

Sherman is known for being a tough guy and a bit of a fire-starter. The La Times crowns him the king of post game rants and said that he introduced 'U mad, bro?' into the sports insult vocabulary.

USA Today writer Chris Chase defended Sherman in an article and wrote, ' Sherman is brash, loud and so self-centered he makes Kanye look like a wallflower. He’s also the best corner in the game and on his way to the Super Bowl. You don’t have to like it, Michael, but you at least need to understand it. Next time you beat Richard Sherman, you can talk all you want. Until then, begrudgingly shake the man’s hand and enjoy your offseason.'

Sherman wrote a final response that said, 'A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of a sheep.'

Despite Sherman's charged retort, Crabtree remains anything but sheepish.
