Girls Gone Wild mogul Joe Francis may have finally hit rock-bottom.

In the latest of a slew of legal issues for the spring break kingpin, Mr Francis is reportedly on the verge of losing his Bel-Air mansion. The house that spring break built is worth over $11million.

Mr Francis is said to have substantially fallen behind on his mortgage payments, according to reports.

Once worth as much as $50million from monster sales of his ‘Girls Gone Wild’ DVDs, Mr Francis earlier this year declared bankruptcy seven months ago.

Since then, he has reportedly fallen behind on mortgage payments for his $11.4million estate to the tune of $127,686.91, JPMorgan Chase Bank told TMZ.

When reached for comment, the porn peddler told the website his accountant was handling the problem.

Just last month, Mr Francis was sentenced to a minimum of 270 days in jail for assault and false imprisonment after a 2011 incident in which he grabbed a woman by the neck and slammed her head into the floor of his soon-to-be repossessed home.

Mr Francis became violent when he tried to separate one woman from a group of three that went back to his home against their will and they objected. He then tried intimidating the other two into not calling the police.

Last year, Mr Francis was ordered by a judge to pay $19million to casino magnate Steve Wynn in a defamation lawsuit.

Not all has been bad for Mr Francis, he has recently caught one break. A sex tape featuring him and his girlfriend - which he claimed was stolen from her iPad - was being shopped around before being picked up by Vivid Video head Steve Hirsch.

Mr Hirsch then made sure the video made its way to Mr Francis.
