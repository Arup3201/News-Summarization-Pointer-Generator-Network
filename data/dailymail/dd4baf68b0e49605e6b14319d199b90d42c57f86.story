On an individual level there were occasional moments of brilliance from Cristiano Ronaldo during Portugal’s draw with USA - not least his fabulous series of skills in the fourth minute and his perfect assist for Silvestre Varela's late leveller - but collectively his team suffered because of his positioning, or lack of it.

In the first half he started on the left of a forward three, but minutes in he was yards away from Nani on the right.

His unpredictable movements, perhaps in part to do with the knee injury that has been troubling him this last month, made it difficult for his team-mates to know where to play.

Out of sorts: Cristiano Ronaldo looks to the sky during a mixed display for Portugal against USA

Maybe he was moving inside to limit the distance of his sprints, or just to try and see more of the ball.

There was one passage of play that had fans of both sides on their feet in the opening minutes of the game.

After stealing the ball from Alejandro Bedoya on the left he drove forward, chopped inside a challenge from Jermaine Jones, pulled off a Cruyff turn to get away from Fabian Johnson, and then stroked the ball from one foot to the other as Jones came in for a second helping. Somehow, Ronaldo emerged with the ball on the other side, where he teed it off to Joao Moutinho.

Other than that dribble his first half was punctuated by overhit passes and hugely ambitious attempts on goal that flew way off target. On more than one occasion it was the pitch that let him down - if his dramatic gestures were anything to go by.

His tactical indiscipline left Portugal’s left side wide open, and USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann was clever enough to exploit it.

Chance after chance was created down USA's right and it was surprising the Americans were not level at the break, after Nani had lifted an effort over Tim Howard to give Portugal an early lead. 

USA threw players forward after the break and Jermaine Johnson made it 1-1 with a phenomenal swerving effort that Ronaldo would have been proud of.

Then, the inevitable happened, Klinsmann's side scored from an attack down their right.

Bruno Alves failed to clear the cross and Michael Bradley had a shot saved, before the ball was cannoned back in by Graham Zusi and Clint Dempsey was on hand to deflect it over the line.

Yet, when Paulo Bento's side were chasing a late equaliser, there was Ronaldo.

Four-and-a-half minutes into the allotted five of added time, the Real Madrid forward received the ball in space on the right and whipped an inch-perfect cross to the back post for Varela to thump a header home.
