With polo, scuba diving and fly fishing all on his sporting CV, Prince Charles certainly isn't one to shy away from a spot of vigorous exercise.

And the sporty royal certainly met his match today in the shape of Jamaican boxer Cheavon Clarke who jokingly squared up to the Prince of Wales - much to his delight.

Watched by a chuckling Duchess of Cornwall, the two indulged in a mock bout with Charles even pretending to throw a punch before shaking Clarke's hand instead.

The lighthearted moment had echoes of Prince Harry's visit to Jamaica in 2012, when the cheeky royal 'won' a race against sprinter Usain Bolt by haring off when the athlete's back was turned.

But Clarke wasn't the only boxing star to make a big impression on the royal visitors: Prince Charles looked on in awe as members of the Indian women's team engaged in a practice bout, while the Duchess of Cornwall indulged in a friendly chat with the Kenyans.

They also stopped to offer a few words of support to the Australian badminton team before posing for a group photo surrounded by green and gold.

Afterwards, Charles and Camilla, who are known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, continued their tour of the Emirates Arena in Glasgow with a visit to the Velodrome to meet Olympic star, Sir Chris Hoy.

Members of the British cycling team, which won a record seven gold medals at the London 2012, later took to Twitter to tell of their royal encounter, with Canadian cyclist Ed Veal excitedly tweeting about the experience.

'Met Prince Charles & Camilla at the velodrome today,' he wrote. 'Walked right up as I was exiting the track,shook hands said hello. Looking for pics pls.'

Team England physio Stephen Chew posted a series of photos of the event and added the caption:

Later, the royal couple are due to visit the headquarters of the Scottish Ballet, which is also located in Glasgow, before joining the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games tonight.

Also in town for the official opening are Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex, who yesterday joined competitors at the Athletes Village for a flag raising ceremony.
