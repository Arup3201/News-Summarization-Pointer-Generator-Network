A tearful Catholic mother has apologised for her ‘lone wolf’ Muslim militant son who was arrested in New York when allegedly just one hour away from completing a homemade pipe bomb.

Carmen Sosa, 56, mother of U.S. citizen Jose Pimentel, 27, who was born in the Dominican Republic and is a follower of late Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, said she is ‘disappointed’ with his actions.

She said her son - arrested on Saturday at his apartment in Manhattan - started to change 10 years ago when he began reading the Koran and she brought him from his home upstate to the city.

In court: U.S. citizen Jose Pimentel - who was born in the Dominican Republic and is a follower of late Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki - was arrested on Saturday at his apartment Manhattan, New York

Plot: Suspect Jose Pimentel had constructed three pipe bombs, and planned to test them by placing them in mailboxes, NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly said

‘I want to apologise to the city of 
New York,’ she told the New York Post and the Daily News. ‘I'm 
disappointed with what my son was doing. I want to thank the police - I 
think they handled it well.’

The Al Qaeda sympathiser allegedly 
wanted to kill American soldiers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq and
 had already shaved match heads and drilled holes in pipes when 
he was arrested.

‘I love him - I 
didn't raise him that way,' Mrs Sosa, who works with homeless people who are mentally ill, added. 'He changed. I cannot sleep... I don't know him. He dropped out of school. He's had a lot of jobs but 
he's not working now.’

Pimentel had converted to Islam and 
became a radical, authorities claimed. ‘We had to act quickly because he
 was in fact putting this bomb together,’ New York Police Commissioner 
Ray Kelly said.

Jose Pimentel, 27, is an American citizen and Islam convert originally from the Dominican Republic.

He is believed to have been inspired by radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, and further influenced by his online terror magazine, Inspire.

Pimentel spoke of changing his name to Osama Hussein in support of his two heroes, Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.

The NYPD counter-terrorism unit had been following him since May 2009, when he began speaking about violent jihad. 

Pimentel turned his talk into action after the death of Awlaki on September 30 and began building a bomb, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said.

He faces several terrorism-related charges, including first-degree criminal possession of a weapon as a crime of terrorism.

He admitted he ‘took active 
steps to build the bomb, including shaving the match heads and drilling 
holes in the pipes’ and was ‘one hour away from completing it’, court papers said.

He was under surveillance since May 
2009 and considered New York police cars, a New Jersey police station 
and U.S. post office among his potential targets, officials said.

As a reader of the online magazine 
‘Inspire’ published by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, he read 
instructions in an article ‘How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your 
Mom,’ Commissioner Kelly said.

‘We think an event that really set him
 off was the elimination of Anwar al-Awlaki,’ Mr Kelly said. ‘His 
actions became a lot more intense after September 30.’

A U.S. drone strike killed U.S. 
citizen Awlaki in Yemen in late September, ending a two-year hunt for 
the man U.S. intelligence called the ‘chief of external operations’ for 
al Qaeda's Yemen branch.

Commissioner Kelly said Pimentel 
‘talked about changing his name to Osama Hussein to celebrate his heroes
 Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein’.

A police informant recorded meetings 
with Pimentel over several months and accompanied him as he bought 
materials for the bomb - including a drill and a clock, the criminal 
complaint said.

Since 9/11, New York City has 
considered itself a prime target and has developed extensive 
intelligence and counterterrorism divisions that employ 1,000 officers 
within the police department.

'We had to act quickly because he was in fact putting this bomb together'

NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly

No suspects have yet been convicted 
under New York state anti-terrorism laws passed after the attacks. 
Pimentel, who has not been charged in federal court, faces life in 
prison if convicted.

At Pimentel's arraignment after the 
press conference, his lawyer Joseph Zablocki said his behaviour leading 
up to the arrest was not that of a conspirator trying to conceal some 
violent scheme.

'I don't believe that this case is 
nearly as strong as the people believe,’ he said. ‘He [Pimentel] has 
this very public online profile... This is not the way you go about 
committing a terrorist attack.'

Pimentel, also known as Muhammad 
Yusuf, was denied bail and remained in custody. The bearded, 
bespectacled man wore a t-shirt and drawstring trousers. He smiled at 
times during the proceeding.

'This is just another example of New York City because we are an iconic city... this is a city that people would want to take away our freedoms gravitate to and focus on'

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg

Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the Pimentel case the 14th plot against the city since 2001.

Most of these have been deemed 
‘aspirational.’ But some, such as the failed May 2010 attempt to set off
 a bomb in Times Square, were closer to being carried out.

Mayor Bloomberg said: 'This is just 
another example of New York City because we are an iconic city... this 
is a city that people would want to take away our freedoms gravitate to 
and focus on.'

Counterterrorism officials say ‘lone 
wolf’ militants are of great concern because they can become radicalised
 online and prepare for an attack without leaving traces that might draw
 attention.
