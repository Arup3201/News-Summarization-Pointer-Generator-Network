Southampton will hold a second round of talks with Ronald Koeman next week as the Dutchman emerges as the front runner for their vacant manager's position.

The Saints are on the look out for a new boss following the departure of Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham last month, Koeman is currently out of work having left Feyenoord at the end of last season and is keen to manage in the Barclays Premier League.

Members of the St Mary's hierarchy were understood to be hugely impressed by Koeman during initial talks earlier this week.

The south coast club are keeping an open mind regarding Pochettino's replacement, but the fact they want to meet with Koeman again is indicative to the ex-Holland international's chances of landing the role.

Southampton are keen to have a new manager in place by the end of next week.

The new boss' first job will be to deal with interest in the club's top players including Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Dejan Lovren from rival clubs.

Rickie Lambert has already joined Liverpool for an initial Â£4million fee.
