Andy Murray hardly needs any extra incentive when he steps out at the French Open, but he got it anyway on Monday night when Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka was humbled.

The Swiss was Murray’s scheduled last-eight opponent until he fell to a dismal 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-0 defeat to Spain’s Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, opening up that whole quarter of the draw.

Nobody has done more this season to puncture the aura of the ‘Big Four’ than Wawrinka, who followed up his  Melbourne triumph with victory at the Monte Carlo Open in April. In climbing to world No 3 he has amassed a 6-0 record against top-10 players in 2014, and that stands intact because Garcia-Lopez is ranked only 41st.

Wawrinka’s error-strewn first-round performance as the light faded emphasised how consistent Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Murray have been in winning round after round in the Grand Slams over the last 10 years.

Down and out: Stanislas Wawrinka never looked comfortable in heavy conditions in Paris

Over and out: Wawrinka's defeat by Guillermo Garcia-Lopez opened the draw up for Andy Murray

The pressure of turning up at a major 
with the expectations  created by what he did in Australia appeared to 
have withered Wawrinka, while the unseeded Spaniard showed how dangerous
 the rank-and-file can be.

For
 Murray, Tuesday afternoon will be the first time since 2011 that he 
goes into a Grand Slam  without Ivan Lendl in his corner. A good run at 
Roland Garros might yet persuade him to delay an appointment until after
 Wimbledon, lest a change cause disruption at a crucial time.

Australian
 Darren Cahill has ruled himself out of any permanent appointment and 
Californian Larry Stefanki, another name associated with the post, also 
appears to be a non-runner.

Murray
 cannot be preoccupied by such things when he takes on Andrey Golubev, 
one of several Russians who has defected to Kazakhstan due to the lure 
of extra financial support from the newly rich nation.

The world No 53 is a fan of the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and has just finished reading Crime and Punishment.

Unfamiliar: Murray enters his first grand slam since 2011 without Ivan Lendl as his coach

Nishikori crumbles

Michael Chang's return to Roland Garros 25 years after he won the title as a  17-year-old did not last long.

Chang is coaching Japanese No 9 seed Kei Nishikori, who has been struggling with back problems and went out 7-6, 6-1, 6-2 to Martin Klizan.

Congrats on the loss, Nick

In Nicolas Mahut’s press conference after his loss to Mikhail Kukushkin, an American reporter opened with ‘Congratulations’.

The Frenchman replied: ‘Are you serious, did you watch the match?’ — ‘No, I was told that you won, I’m sorry’. Reply: ‘Questions in French please.’ 

Marathon effort

Argentinian qualifier Facundo Bagnis defeated Frenchman Julien Benneteau 6-1, 6-2, 1-6,  3-6, 18-16. The 144-minute deciding set took longer than the first four put together.

Golubev
 would like to inflict the latter on Murray, and the weapon he will 
employ is his forehand which, when it runs hot, is potent enough to 
cause anyone problems.

‘I 
have to play my tennis,’ said Golubev, whose parents are both doctors. 
‘Every match you can be different with the tactics, with the small 
things, but basically I will attack. I’m not going to stay behind the 
baseline five metres just waiting for his mistakes.’

The
 glitz of the Grand Slams will have seemed remote to James Ward 
yesterday, and the closest he came to any glamour was having the brother
 of  Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna in his corner. Avid Gooner Ward, who 
is friends with the Gunners’ wavering defender, exited amid the grey and
 the drizzle to the formidable Tommy Robredo.

But
 Ward’s creditable performance in going down 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 to the 
No 17 seed at least suggested that the annual charge of the British men 
on grass this summer — which begins next week at Nottingham — might not 
boil down purely to a  27-year-old Scot.

After
 playing an excellent first set the British No 3 was slightly 
unfortunate to be forced off for rain, which did not just stop his 
momentum but made the clay slow and heavy, which better suited the 
rock-solid Spaniard.

‘Look, 
I’m 27; I’m not 32. People sometimes forget that,’ he said of his 
top-100 prospects. ‘I’ve had injuries in the past when I’ve had chances,
 but it’s not an excuse. You got to take time and work your way up.’

Brave: James Ward took the first set before being beaten by No 17 seed Tommy Robredo

Steady: The Spaniard showed his class to pull away from Ward and claim his place in the second round

Qualifier
 Heather Watson opens on Tuesday morning against Barbora Zahlavova Strycova, 
the world No 63 from the Czech Republic, against whom she will try and 
continue her eight-match  winning streak.

The
 Czech is best known for being banned last year after  testing positive 
for the banned substance sibutramine, which she claimed to have ingested
 accidentally through a weight-loss supplement. Watson has an even 
chance of progress.

Whatever
 she does, it is unlikely to be as trying a day as it will be for 
Caroline Wozniacki, who makes her first public appearance since Rory 
McIlroy broke off their engagement. She plays Yanina Wickmayer of 
Belgium this afternoon and will find it hard to match the rebounding 
that her ex-fiancee managed on the golf course on Sunday. 

Bow: Britain's Heather Watson will take on Barbora Zahlavova Strycova on Tuesday

Test: Caroline Wozniacki will play her first game since splitting from Rory McIlroy

One thing you can count on is that her post-match press conference will draw one of the bigger crowds of the day.

But he was in trouble virtually from the start on Court Philippe Chatrier and became the first Australian Open champion to lose in the first round in Paris since Petr Korda in 1998.

Wawrinka, who has struggled at times with his new status as a major favourite, made the quarter-finals in Paris last year for the first time having reached the fourth round in the previous three years.
