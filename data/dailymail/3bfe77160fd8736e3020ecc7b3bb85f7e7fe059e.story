Defence chiefs have attempted to block the production of a new film about the death of a British soldier in Afghanistan – because it portrays how the RAF botched a rescue mission.

Corporal Mark Wright died in September 2006 after becoming stranded in an unmarked minefield during a mission against Taliban fighters near the strategically important Kajaki Dam in Helmand province.

But tragedy struck when a Chinook helicopter sent to rescue Cpl Wright and other British soldiers set off mines in the area as it attempted to land, causing him fatal injuries and injuring others.

The Ministry of Defence was heavily criticised at the inquest into Cpl Wright’s death in 2009, with the coroner saying officials should ‘hang their heads in shame’ over the failure to send a properly equipped aircraft. 

Now the incident has been depicted in a new film, Kajaki: A True Story, which will be released next month.

The movie, which stars Game Of Thrones actor Mark Stanley as a medic who tries to save Cpl Wright, is backed by Help For Heroes and other military charities which will receive a percentage of the box office takings.

But the makers have told The Mail on Sunday that they were blocked in their attempts to research key parts of the story, because MoD officials refused permission to speak to any of the air crew involved.

Cpl Wright, 27 took command when two paratroopers at the front of a patrol were blown up by mines. He sent a radio request for a helicopter equipped with a winch to lift the wounded to safety.

Cpl Wright also warned the helicopter should not attempt to land in case the downdraught from its engines caused more explosions, the inquest said. 

But this instruction was ignored and instead a Chinook without a winch was sent, which led directly to his death and to more paratroopers being wounded.

Producers from Pukka Films wanted to understand every aspect of the incident, including why the Chinook crew seemingly ignored Cpl Wright’s attempts to wave it away.

Last night, Defence sources confirmed the MoD turned down repeated requests to speak to officers aboard the helicopter that day.

The film is poised to shock cinema audiences with its retelling of how Cpl Wright and his fellow paratroopers were let down by military officials.

Disabled troops who recently competed in the Invictus Games – a sporting festival set up by Prince Harry – are expected to attend the premiere on November 12.

They will meet Cpl Wright’s parents, who are fully behind the movie even though they admit they may find some of the scenes too shocking to watch.

Last night, the soldier’s father Bob Wright, 67, from Edinburgh, said he hoped makers had got over obstacles put in their path by Defence officials. 

‘They weren’t trying to bring the MoD down in any way, they’re just trying to show the bravery of the guys,’ he said. 

‘We’re excited and nervous. I’m not going to watch the whole film, but I may go in for the start. If it gets too heavy I’ll come out.’

The Mail on Sunday was given an exclusive preview of the film which portrays the events of September 6, 2006. 

On that day, Cpl Wright and colleagues from the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 Para) became trapped in a minefield which was not marked on their maps.

With his colleagues L/Cpl Stuart Hale and Sgt Stuart Pearson lying in agony after being blown up, Cpl Wright, played by David Elliot, sends an emergency radio message requesting a helicopter should be dispatched to lift them out of the minefield.

But UK commanders tell Cpl Wright no British helicopters fitted with the necessary equipment are available. Instead, they suggest he should move the casualties to an area where it would be safe for the Chinook to land.

As the soldier explains, this is not an option due to the number of mines. The film then recreates the tragic moment when a twin-rotor Chinook hovers over Cpl Wright, the wounded paratroopers and the medic, Cpl Paul ‘Tug’ Hartley. 

The Chinook produces powerful blasts of air and – just as Cpl Wright had warned – more mines explode. As the dust settles, Wright is seen lying on the ground, his gaping wounds and charred face providing a harrowing reminder of the reality of war.

Gasping for breath and in excruciating pain, he continues to issue orders to his colleagues, six of whom are now wounded. 

He insists they should not allow themselves to sleep because this will accelerate their physical decline. ‘No snoozing boys, OK?’ he croaks.

It takes commanders six hours to send US Black Hawk helicopters fitted with winches to rescue the casualties. In the film, this period is boiled down to a harrowing 45 minutes as Wright and his colleagues desperately fight their injuries.

A tear-jerking scene based on the testimony of survivors of the incident sees Cpl Wright tell ‘Tug’ Hartley he can feel himself getting colder. Fearing the onset of death, he issues a series of requests about his fiancee Gill Urquhart and family, which make for gripping viewing:

‘Tell Gill I love her. Tell her to marry someone else and to be happy. Tell my parents to have a big party with a cash-free bar. Tell them I was a good soldier, tell them I died like a good Para.’ 

Desperately, Hartley seeks to reassure Cpl Wright that he will pull through, but by the time the US helicopters arrive he is only just clinging to life.

In a selfless gesture typical of Cpl Wright, one of his last actions is to offer words of support to a casualty who is in a much better state than himself. Wright dies moments later.

At the time of his death, he was preparing to marry Ms Urquhart, his fiancee of nine years. She has followed the wishes of her former partner and has since married and is now a mother of two children.

For his actions that day, Cpl Wright was awarded a posthumous George Cross, the UK’s highest award for bravery not in the face of the enemy. 

Sgt Pearson was awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal and Tug Hartley the George Medal. At an inquest held into the causes of Cpl Wright’s death, coroner Andrew Walker made a withering attack on the MoD. 

The inquest heard the helicopter did set off the mine which killed Cpl Wright while the coroner highlighted three factors which caused his death – the downdraught from the Chinook, the lack of appropriate British helicopters fitted with winches, and the delay in sending a suitable helicopter.

Other criticisms included the failure of the officer responsible for passing updated information about the mine threat being unable to interpret the maps, and that local knowledge had been ignored. Cpl Wright’s death also led to the RAF fitting Chinook helicopters with winches.

A MoD spokesman said last night: ‘It is untrue to suggest the MoD has withdrawn its support or attempted to block the Kajaki film in any way. We agreed to provide a specific amount of support to this project and we honoured that agreement.’
