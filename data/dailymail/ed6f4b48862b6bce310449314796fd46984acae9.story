Alastair Cook’s job as England’s captain for next year’s World Cup will be rubber stamped on Tuesday morning.

The opening batsman - whose place in the one-day team has come under massive scrutiny - has been told he will lead the country for the tour to Sri Lanka in November and December.

And that means he’s certain to stay in charge for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in the New Year.

National selector James Whitaker and his panel of head coach Peter Moores, Angus Fraser and Mick Newell met yesterday to agree the strategy for the winter and decided to stick by the 29-year-old – even though England have lost five One Day series while he has been in charge.

Pundits like Geoff Boycott, Michael Vaughan and Graeme Swann have all demanded change and pointed out Cook’s poor form in ODIs – he hasn’t made 80 in a 50-over match in more than two years.

But they decided that with Eoin Morgan and Joe Root the only possible alternatives there was nothing to be gained by dumping the skipper.
