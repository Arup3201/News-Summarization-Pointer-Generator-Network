Biologists are hunting for an ivory thief who sawed off seven teeth from a dead orca who was pregnant with a full-term fetus.

The 18-year-old killer whale J-32, nicknamed Rhapsody, was found floating in the water last Thursday off Vancouver Island in Canada. 

When experts arrived Saturday to perform an autopsy on the marine mammal they were dismayed to find her carcass had been looted.

A couple of teeth had reportedly been broken off and others sawed off at the jawline.

'Someone last night, selfishly, cruelly, illegally cut off several teeth from her. 

'It’s a crime that can’t be described. It’s a crime against science,' Marcie Callewaert of the Victoria Marine Science Association told CTV News.

Jean Rowe, a resident from the city of Courtenay who had been keeping an eye on J-32 as her body lay taped off on the beach, said she was 'devastated' about the theft.

She suspected someone had taken the teeth to sell as ivory or to keep as a trophy. 

The necropsy on J-32 showed she was pregnant with a full-term fetus. 

Experts had speculated the death may have arisen from birth complications.

Happier times: J-32, seen at right, was a member of the J-pod, one of three families of southern resident killer whales that spend time in the inland waters of Washington state and Canada

Tissue samples from the mother and child will be sent to labs across North America, with results expected in four to six weeks.

The skeletons will be donated to the Royal B.C. Museum. 

Locals are appealing for the teeth to be returned so J-32 can go on display in her complete state. 

The expectant mother was a member of the J-pod, one of three families of southern resident killer whales that spend time in the inland waters of Washington state and Canada.

She was reportedly last photographed on November 26 with her family east of Victoria, 

The death leaves 77 animals in the Puget Sound orca population.

Despite a decade of research, protection and recovery efforts, the animals continue to struggle primarily due to lack of food, pollution and disturbances from marine vessels.
