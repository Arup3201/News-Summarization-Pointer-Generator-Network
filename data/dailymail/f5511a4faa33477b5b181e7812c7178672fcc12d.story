Medical attention: Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail in south-east London

Prison bosses have been accused of ‘political correctness’ for suspending five guards and calling police over an alleged attack on one of the Woolwich soldier murder suspects.

Scotland Yard is investigating after Michael Adebolajo, accused of killing Drummer Lee Rigby outside his barracks, lost two teeth in a confrontation with officers in a special high-security cell at HMP Belmarsh.

The remand prisoner’s supporters believe if he had not suffered such obvious injuries, the incident would have been hushed up by the authorities.

But the union for prison guards insists its members were following rules as they tried to restrain 28-year-old Adebolajo, who is said to have been uncooperative and threatening.

Peter McParlin, national chairman of the Prison Officers’ Association (POA), told the Mail on Sunday last night that the five suspended officers were angry and had been made scapegoats by bosses because of the suspect’s high profile.

‘They’re distraught because they feel they’ve done absolutely nothing wrong. They’ve acted along prescribed lines and they’re shocked they’ve been suspended.

‘We’re annoyed with the Ministry of Justice for letting this run that he’d been attacked, when they should have said it was the result of control and restraint incident.

‘I suspect that Ministry of Justice officials have over-reacted, they’ve tried to be politically correct. But I’m afraid that’s not doing our members, as a trade union, any good at all.

‘It’s a prisoner with notoriety. They let the media believe that prisoner had been attacked in prison. The staff felt the need to restrain him. I’m afraid on occasion that’s their job.

‘Some think we’re in a cosy Porridge world. As most sensible people know, that’s not the reality.’

Accusations: Adebolajo is accused of hacking Fusilier Rigby (left) to death together with Michael Adebowale, 22 (right, in a court drawing). The two suspects are due to stand trial on November 18

Steve Gillan, 
General Secretary of the POA, added: ‘Let us be clear this was a 
restraint of a prisoner who failed to comply with instructions and 
prison officers believed he was a threat to them.

‘My members look 
after some of the most difficult and dangerous prisoners on behalf of 
society yet there seems little protection for officers against these 
sort of allegations.

‘Suspension is wrong in this instance and sends the wrong message to prisoners.’

The Mail on Sunday 
understands that Adebolajo and his co-accused Michael Adebowale, 22, are
being held in a special unit in the centre of the Category A jail in 
south east London, just over a mile away from where they are accused of 
slaying Drummer Rigby in broad daylight in May.

Concrete cells in 
the unit, originally built to house IRA terrorists, have airlock doors 
and are home to some of the highest-risk inmates in the British penal 
system. David Bieber, the former US Marine, who shot dead PC Ian 
Broadhurst in Leeds in 2003 is also kept there.

Adebolajo has 
previously accused prison staff of mistreating him. During a bizarre 
rant when he appeared by video link at the Old Bailey, he said he was 
‘sick of’ guards demanding to inspect his genitals because of laws made 
by a ‘jobsworth’.

On Wednesday he is 
said to have refused to obey prison officers’ instructions during a cell
visit and made ‘aggressive moves’ towards them.

When they moved to restrain him, Adebolajo is said to have been badly injured.

A family source said: ‘His head was smashed against the window or wall in his cell causing serious injury.

‘If his teeth 
hadn’t been knocked out then the Governor could have covered it all up. 
But he was clearly badly injured and he complained to his family and his
lawyers. He had been expecting something like this to happen.’

Prison authorities 
called the Metropolitan Police, who are now investigating an alleged 
assault, while the inmate was treated in Belmarsh’s medical wing.

Jail: It is understood several officers were called in to help after Adebolajo began acting violently on Wednesday, and he was injured during the subsequent melee in the prison's high-security wing

The next day four 
officers, from a group of seven always on hand when Adebolajo’s cell is 
unlocked, were suspended from duty and on Friday a fifth guard was sent 
home while investigations continue.
Adebolajo and Adebowale are due to stand trial in November for the alleged murder of Drummer Rigby, 25, and firearms offences.

The Ministry of 
Justice declined to comment on the allegations that it had over-reacted 
to the prison incident. It would only confirm that five officers had 
been suspended while police investigated.

A Metropolitan 
Police spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that an allegation of assault was
passed to the Metropolitan Police Service on 17 July by Belmarsh 
Prison. An investigation has been started.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
