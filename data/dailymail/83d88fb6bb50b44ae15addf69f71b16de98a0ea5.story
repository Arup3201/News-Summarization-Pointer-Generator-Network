A University of New Mexico star football player is accused, with two other men, of raping a female student in a moving car and has been dropped from the team.

Crusoe Gongbay, 20, who was slated to be the UNM Lobos' starting running back as a senior in the fall, is being held on $50,000 bond after he turned himself in to campus police on Monday.

Gongbay and another man, Ryan Ruff, who is not a student, each face two counts of second-degree criminal sexual penetration, one count of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy, UNM Police Lt Tim Stump said.

At around 3 a.m. on April 13, a female student reported to campus police that she had been a victim of a rape.

According to a UNM report cited by the Albuquerque Journal, the victim said she was forced to engage in sexual intercourse with three subjects while inside a moving motor vehicle.

Stump told the Journal officials wouldn't release any more of the report.

Investigators say they consulted with the district attorney's office before requesting arrest warrants.

Ruff, who turned himself in on Monday night, is being held on a $100,000 bond. Officers are trying to determine the identity of a third man reported to have been involved, and are working on a  composite. Ruff and the unidentified suspect are not UNM students.

The alleged rapist on the loose is described as about 6ft tall and 180 to 200lbs with a dark complexioned and dark hair that is short on the sides and longer on top.

Investigators say the alleged victim underwent evaluation from the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner Unit and the evidence was sent to the state crime lab for processing. The results from the crime lab are not back yet.

Gongbay, who is 6ft, 205lbs, comes from from Rockville, Maryland. He was recruited to UNM by former coach Mike Locksley in 2011.

After leading the Lobos in rushing that season, Gongbay intended to follow Locksley to Maryland but his plans fell through so he asked the new coach, Bob Davie, if he could return to UNM.

Davie said he was impressed by Gongbay's good academic standing and knew his teammates liked him so welcomed him back in August 2012. He has played effectively as a backup running back the past two seasons.

Suspended from the team: In a statement Monday, Davie said he was aware of the allegations and due to the serious nature of the charges he had suspended the junior, pictured left and right, indefinitely

In a statement Monday, Davie said he was aware of the allegations and due to the serious nature of the charges he had suspended the junior indefinitely.

'Once this process is complete and all the details have emerged, we will handle the outcome appropriately,' Davie added.

UNM Dean of Students Tomas Aguirre said the University was taking the case 'very seriously.'

'The Dean of Students office has met with the survivor and her family and offered our support and any other accommodations she might need,' he said in a statement.

'We have also connected her with the various resources available to her both on and off campus, including the UNM Women’s Resource Center and the Rape Crisis Center of New Mexico. Since this is an open investigation, we are unable to provide any other details at this time.'
