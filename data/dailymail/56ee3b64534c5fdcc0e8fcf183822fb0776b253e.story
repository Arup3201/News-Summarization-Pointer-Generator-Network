Heiko Salzwedel has joined British Cycling's coaching staff for a third time as part of a restructuring led by technical director Shane Sutton.

Sutton became technical director when Sir Dave Brailsford left his role as performance director in April to focus solely on Team Sky.

German Salzwedel has been tasked with leading the men's endurance squad in the lead-up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, having worked with British Cycling for short spells post-Sydney and post-Beijing. He will begin his position on November 1.

Salzwedel must galvanise a team pursuit squad which has struggled to fire since winning Olympic gold at London 2012, finishing a dismal eighth at the 2014 Track World Championships in Colombia, but bolstered by the return of Sir Bradley Wiggins to the velodrome.

Paul Manning returns to overseeing the women's endurance squad which he led to gold in London, while Chris Newton reverts to the coaching the Olympic Academy men's endurance squad.

Sutton said: 'I'm pleased to be able to welcome Heiko back on to the Great Britain cycling team in the role of national men's endurance coach.

'He has a wealth of knowledge and experience which I believe will help drive forward the performances of the men's endurance squad.'

Sir Chris Hoy was one of the members of the extremely successful British Cycling team at London 2012

Iain Dyer, a member of the sprint coaching team, has been appointed as coach coordinator and will be responsible for the coordination of podium coach related operations, assisting in coach development planning and will be involved in major event selection panels.

Dyer will continue to coach the sprinters, alongside Jan van Eijden and New Zealander Justin Grace, who was appointed last month.

Sutton added: 'I am pleased that Iain Dyer has accepted the additional responsibility to become coach coordinator which I think will galvanise the work of the podium coaches.

'I believe that these changes, along with the recent addition of Justin Grace to the sprint squad coaching team, put us in good stead at this stage of the Olympic cycle.'
