A man suffered a fatal heart attack as he was robbing a grocery store in Maryland, police say.

Cristie Kahler, spokesman for the Harford County Sheriff's Office, said deputies found the handgun underneath his body.

No shots were fired. 

Officers attempted CPR and two AED shocks before emergency medical workers arrived, according to the Baltimore Sun.

He was pronounced dead at 10.52pm in Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air.

Evidence recovered from Clark's home connected him to two robberies in November - one an armed robbery in the same Aldi store, the other in the nearby Dollar General Store where he told staff he had a weapon.
