The private firm that decides whether benefit claimants are fit for work has a backlog of more than 700,000 people, it has emerged.

Atos has been berated by ministers as the number of people awaiting assessment has more than trebled to 712,000 in four years.

The figures are the latest in a catalogue of failures by the firm, which has been forced to end its Government contract ahead of schedule.

Not satisfied: Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning told MPs at the department's select committee yesterday that Atos Healthcare is incapable of carrying out the work capability assessments

Blasting the company, Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning said: 'I don't think Atos had the capacity to do what was asked.'

A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spokesman addressing the Work and Pensions Select Committee added that Atos 'couldn't deliver the quality at the capacity we want'.

The DWP said the total backlog stood at 712,000 people - 394,000 new claimants and 234,000 awaiting reassessments to decide whether they are still entitled to the benefit.

A further 84,000 are people still on incapacity benefit who have not yet been moved over to ESA.

Mr Penning admitted the government failed
 to meet its own deadline of moving these people onto the new benefit by
 April, and they are still awaiting assessment.

Atos Healthcare has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended for work or put through stressful medical interviews.

One third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has become a lightning rod for Left-wing critics of the Government’s welfare reforms.

Backlog: With Atos in charge, a backlog of 712,000 claimants has built up - three times more than in 2010

The company revealed it has been in discussions with officials for ‘several months’ about ending its work capability assessment contract, which was due to run until August 2015.

But speaking at the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, representatives of the firm claim they have been 'vilified' by the Government despite doing what was asked of them.

Senior vice president Lisa Coleman said Atos had become a 'lightning rod' for public anger and it was 'massively over-simplistic' to think a change of provider would change that.

Mr Penning said a decision in March to end Atos's contract early was based on the fact he had lost faith in the firm.

He said a new contractor - expected to be appointed in early 2015 - would not be chosen on cost alone but on its ability to carry out the assessments in a timely and proper fashion.

The DWP said: 'Incapacity Benefit 
reassessment has resulted in over 700,000 people looking for, or making 
steps to return to work - it is crucial that we continue this important 
process to ensure that people are not written off and we get a fair deal
 for the taxpayer.'
