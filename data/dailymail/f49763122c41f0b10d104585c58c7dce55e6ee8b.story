A Dutch airline boss found himself threatened with a one-way ticket to Siberia after relieving himself on a fence outside Vladimir Putin’s Sochi home.

Atilay Uslu, who runs Corendon Dutch Airlines, a sponsor of the Dutch Olympic speed skating team, was returning from a night out when he found himself in need of the bathroom.

Mr Uslu decided to use a fence for aim, but was soon surrounded by Russian soldiers.

The incident took place around 2am on Sunday morning after Uslyu and a friend had been out in Sochi celebrating the success of the Dutch skaters.

It emerged that the fence he was using as a ‘bathroom’ protected the villa of the Russian President in the Winter Olympics resort.

‘[They] talked of a one-way ticket to Siberia and asked me if I had not seen the security cameras or knew that it was Putin’s house,’ Mr Uslu told UPI.com.

Fortunately, Mr Uslu was released after one hour in custody, having paid a £830 fine for his ‘crime’.

 ‘I don’t really feel like trying to get it back,’ he said.

The Dutch speedskating team is having a good Olympics so far, in particular Ireen Wust, who took home a gold medal in the women's 3,000-meter speedskating race on Sunday.

She is also the first openly gay athlete to win a medal at the Winter Olympics.

Many were positively surprised when the notoriously anti-gay Putin turned up at Wust's after-party to give her a hug and congratulate her on her win.
