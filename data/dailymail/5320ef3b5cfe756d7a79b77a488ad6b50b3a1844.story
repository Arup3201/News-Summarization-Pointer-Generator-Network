A waitress who won an $11.7 million jackpot is doing the last thing anyone would expect, and returning to work after her big lottery payday.

Rhonda Meath, 51, of Bethel, Minnesota, says nothing is different now that she, and retired husband Joe, have a lot more bucks in their bank account.

'Have to still mow the grass and get mail and put grandkids on the school bus,' the incredibly sensible and down-to-earth mom of four said after her big win. 

Money won't change them: Rhonda Meath of Bethel, Minnesota may have won an $11.7 million jackpot, but she is going to keep in waiting tables

And a big part of keeping things the same for Meath is getting back to work at the Lake Elmo Inn in Lake Elmo, Minnesota.

'I actually really enjoy my job,' Meath, who may now be one of the wealthiest waiters in all the world, told KSTP-TV.

'I have great friends here and a great boss, and it’s just really a fantastic place to work, so I have no plans of leaving.'

The couple, who will actually get to keep all their winnings because Hot Lotto pays their state and federal taxes, don't even plan on any making any big purchases or splurges with their newly acquired funds, saying they will make a few charitable contributions and get a new car.

Even more impressive, the two also plan on starting a college fund for the teenage clerk who sold them the ticket.

Responsible spenders: Rhonda and Joe Meath says they will buy a car and start a college fund for the teenager who sold them the ticket, but have no pl;ans for any other big purchases

The waitress does admit, however, that while the money won't change her, there is one major perk to being a newly minted multimillionaire.

'Oh, I think the kitchen staff is going to be a little nicer to me,' she joked.

And as anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant knows, that just may be worth all the money in the world.
