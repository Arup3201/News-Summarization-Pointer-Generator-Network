Arrest: Alexandru Hossu, an illegal immigrant, has been accused of raping a 12-year-old girl

The former live-in trainer for Judge Judy's district attorney son has been accused of raping a 12-year-old girl and bragging about his connections to the family.

It has also emerged that Alexandru Hossu, who is originally from Romania, is allegedly an illegal immigrant after outstaying his visa - despite working for one of New York's top lawyers.

Adam Levy, the son of television personality 'Judge Judy' Scheindlin, has come under fire for employing Hossu, 35, and giving him accommodation at his million-dollar house in Putnam, New York.

He has vehemently denied knowing about Hossu's immigration status and has become embroiled in a public scrap over the accusations with the sheriff of the county.

Hossu was charged last week with two counts of first-degree rape after the 15-year-old daughter of a friend told a school counselor she had been sexually abused by him when she was 12.

The News Journal spoke to a relative of the girl, who said 'everybody knew' that Hossu was an illegal immigrant. They added that he told everybody he was working for the district attorney.

The relative, who has not been identified to protect the victim, said that Hossu met the girl's mother at a local gym a few years ago, and they struck up a serious relationship.

He is accused of 'forcibly and violently' raping the 12-year-old girl twice in October 2010. It did not occur at Levy's home.

While the relative asked the girl about the rape after she revealed the alleged attacks to her counselor, she simply said: 'I was told not to say anything about it.'

'I don't care if this takes down the 
D.A.,' the relative told the News Journal. 'It's heartbreaking that (the
girl) carried this all by herself and didn’t tell us.'

The revelations have also sparked a feud between Levy and Putnam County Sheriff Donald B. Smith, who has accused the D.A. of using his position to mislead the public.

'In my view, Mr. Levy’s comments and actions would seem to suggest that, if he could have his own way, Mr. Hossu would never have been brought to justice for his crime and Mr. Levy’s relationship with him would have never been brought to the light of public scrutiny,' Smith said in a statement.

Levy in turn has lambasted the sheriff for claiming Hossu lived at his home. The sheriff has countered that the address on Hossu's driving license is the same as Levy's home.

Levy offered two further addresses as
Hossu’s residence, which are both in Clocktower Commons, which is used for office space. One address was also used for a senator's political campaign.

Levy has argued that he had 'absolutely no idea whatsoever' of Hossu's immigration status, and that an investigation with show that Hossu had a valid driver's license and Social Security number.

He has asked a neighbouring county to handle the rape case because he knows the suspect.

Hossu is being held in Putnam County jail in Carmel on $50,000 cash or $100,000 bond, and he is due in court on April 2.

The charges will no doubt come as an embarrassment for Levy's family, including his television personality mother, Judge Judy Sheindlin.

Sheindlin, 70, makes $123,000 per day for a $45 million annual salary, SFGate reported. Forbes listed her net worth at $110 million in 2012.
