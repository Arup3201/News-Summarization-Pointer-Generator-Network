British families are shelling out £2,000 a year more than people in 
other countries thanks to the high cost of transport, energy and 
property costs, according to new research.

Figures have shown that the cost of living in the UK is 11per cent 
higher than the international average, and an incredible 18per cent 
higher than it is in the United States.

Among the biggest cost for British people is transport, which is a staggering 31per cent more than overseas thanks to high fuel duty, motoring costs and expensive public transport.

Expensive: British families are paying more for fuel and property as research shows that the cost of living in the UK is 18per cent higher than in the US, and 11per cent higher than the rest of the world.

Costly: Commuters such as those at Paddington Station in London are victim to some of the highest public transport prices in the world

The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) worked out how pricey life in the UK is after analysing data created by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Experts at the CEBR also came to the conclusion that if they government brought down prices to be in line with international averages over the next decade, it could boost the economy by 15per cent.

As well as high transport costs, 
British people also face paying 18per cent more for housing and 
utilities, such as water and fuel, 14per cent more on recreation and 
cultural activities, while restaurants and hotels are 12per cent more 
expensive.

However, the researchers 
calculated that if prices of housing, commercial property, energy and 
transport were brought down to average levels over the next decade, it 
would save every UK household more than £2,000 pounds a year.

Of course these cost savings could not 
be made overnight,' said CEBR chairman Douglas McWilliams at a lecture 
at Gresham College in London last month.

'But
supposing that they were phased in over 10 years, a rough and ready 
simulation suggests that they would be associated with a rise in GDP of 
around 15per cent compared with what would otherwise have happened.

'Such a boost would offset much of the growth weakness which I currently expect to see in the UK over the coming years and would bring the rate of economic growth over this period to around the historic average of 2.5per cent.'

Mr McWilliams said that car usage was heavily taxed in the UK and that public transport was among the highest in the world.

He said that other high costs reflected the price of property.

Although the OECD figures show that it is more expensive to live in Britain than it is in the USA, Spain, Germany, Italy and France, the UK is still a bargain compared to Denmark.

The cost of living in the Scandinavian country is 29per cent higher, and it is also pricier in Ireland, Canada and New Zealand.

The analysis from the CEBR comes as the Government continues to try and boost growth.

The
Treasury was believed to be blocking Liberal Democrat proposals for a 
'plan A plus' which would aim to boost the economy through 
housebuilding.

Last month 
figures released showed that the economy shrank by 0.3per cent in the 
final quarter of 2012 and had been flat for the rest of the year.

A
forecast of just 0.9per cent has been forecast by the OECD for 2013, 
and new figures set to be released on Wednesday were expected to deliver
a similarly downbeat assessment of the UK economy.

High property prices also to blame
