The Tory party has auctioned a game of tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson for £160,000 – to the wife of a former Russian government minister.

The extraordinary bid won the top prize at the Conservatives’ summer fundraising ball on Wednesday.

It was reportedly won by Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Vladimir Chernukhin, who was deputy finance minister under Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Anyone for tennis? The Tory party has auctioned a game of tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson for £160,000 - to the wife of a former Russian government minister

She is a banker whose husband has donated £5,500 to the party in the last two years.

The former head of Britain’s sleaze watchdog said yesterday that senior Tories should publish details of meetings with foreign billionaires and party donors. 

Sir Alistair Graham said: ‘It is perfectly legitimate for parties to seek donations, but it must be transparent. These events have a corrosive effect on public trust because there is no transparency.’

At the same function, a bottle of champagne signed by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher was auctioned for £40,000.

Other lots were said to include a ‘fantastic eight-gun pheasant shoot’ on the Oxfordshire estate of Syrian-born billionaire Wafic Said, which reportedly sold for £80,000. Guests are said to have dined on smoked duck and chicken rillettes, sea bass and asparagus, and chocolate orange truffle cake with chantilly cream. The exclusive venue for the event – attended by Mr Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and several other ministers – was the Hurlingham Club in Fulham, west London.

Although the party did not publish a guest list, those attending the £12,000-a-table event reportedly included hedge fund manager Sir Michael Hintze and former Barings banker James Lupton. Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire presided over the sales at the event. Selling the ‘ultimate tennis match’, he joked that the ball boys serving the Prime Minister and London mayor would be Tory campaign chief Lynton Crosby and Andrew Feldman, the party’s co-chairman. 

‘They will be picking up David’s balls and then give them to Nick Clegg, who hasn’t got any,’ Mr Swire is said to have joked.

Mrs Chernukhin’s lawyers, Carter Ruck, released a statement to the Guardian newspaper confirming her purchase of the lot.

Shadow leader of the Commons Angela Eagle accused the Tories of living in a ‘parallel universe’.
