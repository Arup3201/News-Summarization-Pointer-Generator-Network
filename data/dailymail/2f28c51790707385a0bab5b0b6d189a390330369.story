The Indianapolis Colts have released rookie safety John Boyett after he boasted to cops they couldn’t arrest him because he was a football player.

A sixth-round draft pick from the University of Oregon this past April, the defensive stand-out became belligerent with a bouncer and cops after not being allowed into an Indianapolis night club early Monday morning because he was too drunk. Mr Boyett was on the non-football injured reserve list and not expected to play in the coming weeks.

Coach Chuck Pagano declined to go into details surrounding Mr Boyett’s release while speaking Wednesday afternoon with local media.

We hardly knew ya: The Colts waved John Boyett after his arrest Monday morning, only months after drafting the standout safety

Mr Boyett, 23, was drafted by the Colts despite missing his entire senior year at Oregon after tearing the patellar tendons in both knees. The safety underwent surgery last year and has been rehabbing them ever since, according to reports.

Despite being unable to make it onto the field, the former Colt found the strength to hobble around town and down several drinks before trying to enter the club.

Bouncers at the unnamed club were forced to call police after Mr Boyett became combative when he was denied entry for being too drunk. The sauced safety then tried to talk his way out of being arrested by name-dropping his glamorous gig.

‘You can’t arrest me, I’m a Colts player,’ Mr Boyett said.

The drunk defender was then booked on charges of public intoxication, resisting law enforcement and disorderly conduct before being released on his own recognizance, an Indianapolis Police Department spokesperson told MailOnline.

No breathalyzer was administered, but Mr Boyett was determined to be drunk by the arresting officer who observed ‘bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and the strong smell of alcohol on his breath,’ the spokesperson added.

The wounded windbag was released Tuesday by the team, which declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding his release when contacted by MailOnline, but did provide a transcript of Coach Pagano’s comments to media.

‘As you know, we released John Boyett yesterday,’ Mr Pagano said Wednesday afternoon. ‘I’m not going to get into the details. Every situation is different and we’ll handle each of them accordingly.’Mr Boyett tweeted a public apology to team owner Jim Irsay, the organization and city police early Wednesday afternoon.

‘I want to apologize to Mr. Irsay @JimIrsay, the Indianapolis Colts organization @Colts and the Indianapolis police,’ Mr Boyett wrote. ‘The Colts gave me an opportunity and I blew it. My behavior didn't and doesn't represent who I am.’

‘I am deeply embarrassed and disappointed in myself. All I can do now is learn from it and never repeat it. I look forward to showing my true character in the future.’

A team spokesman did not respond to a message sent for further comment on whether Mr Boyett would have made the team had he not been arrested. The Colts’ first game is this coming Sunday, and it appears the team has already moved on.

When asked if the arrest and release of Mr Boyett would be a distraction to the team, Coach Pagano replied ‘’our total focus is on preparing for the Raiders. Period.’
