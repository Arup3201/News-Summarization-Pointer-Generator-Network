Wannabe hackers fought off a simulated attack on the BT Tower in London

Communications and television signals are shut down across London as a cyber attack takes hold of the BT Tower.

At least that was the scenario facing a select group of self-taught hackers in a simulation to find the next generation of people to defend Britain's cyber security.

The hackers were pitted against each other in a race against the clock to stop cyber terrorists taking hold of the iconic tower, with potential job offers on the line for undiscovered digital geniuses.

Six teams of four were given the fake challenge of restoring power to the BT Tower, in central London, after it was 'taken over' by a cyber attack.

The contestants were played a video message from the terrorists, who called themselves Flag Day Associates.

The competitors, who were aged 20 to 50, then battled against each other for the right to take part in a master class, with the code breakers working to reverse the staged attack.

Participants, including a welder and a ballroom dancer, worked against the clock for an hour, with one team eventually emerging victorious, CNN reported. 

Experts from National Crime Agency, BT, Raytheon and Airbus Group evaluated the performance of the code breakers. 

Paul Crichard, Raytheon cybersecurity manager, said the competition may have unearthed hidden talent: 'Well this shows how good they are, and it means it is easy for us to come and say actually this person is really talented. They just need a helping hand to get into cybersecurity

'These are some of the best talents we have that aren't in the cybersecurity business today. These are ones who are really spending their own time to be skilled, to understand what is going on in the IT world and where the risks are, and those are the people we can't find through normal recruitment because perhaps they don't think they are good enough.'

Robert Partridge, head of the BT Security Academy, added: 'We give people the skills to be able to remain on the right side of the law. 

'Of course, it is always down to the individual what path they take, but we will give them the utmost encouragement to choose the right side of the law.' 

Yesterday the government warned that a third of Britain's small and medium-sized businesses are vulnerable to cyber attacks, with many mistakenly believing they will not be targeted.
