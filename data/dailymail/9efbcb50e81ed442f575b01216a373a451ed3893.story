Marriage counselor Sheila Loven told her client his marriage was over so he would have sex with her

A marriage counselor who used therapy sessions to drive a couple to divorce so she could continue her affair with the husband told him his marriage was over to get him into bed.

Sheila Loven,
47, of Euless, Texas, had been taking John and Brenda Holliday, from Arlington, for joint 
therapy in 2009 and recommended it would be better to have individual 
sessions.

It was in these private sessions that 
Loven allegedly worked on turning the husband and wife against each 
other, persuading wife Brenda Holliday to file for a divorce and 
coercing the husband John into having an affair with her.

She has been charged with sexual assault and faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted.

The first time the husband visited Loven's apartment after they had been out drinking together the night before in June 2009, she straddled him and kissed him, the court heard yesterday.

He testified he didn't feel good about it and it made him want his wife more.

But he didn't believe there was any chance of getting her back after he sent her flowers, her favorite coffee and a muffin to her work to show her that he had been thinking about her.

Her response was to tell him to never do that again, according to the Star Telegram.

Loven also told him that his wife was through with him. Mr Holliday told the court yesterday that he believed his marriage was over because Loven told him it was.

Mark Scott, one of Loven's attorneys, asked the husband whether he knew 
he was going to have sex with his counselor when he returned to her apartment 
days later.

'You went over to Sheila's house to have sex?' Scott asked.

Mr Holliday answered: 'That's pretty accurate. No one had shown me any attention like that in months,' adding that his wife had starved him of attention and withdrawn her love.

A tearful Brenda Holliday took the stand on Wednesday and testified about her relationship with Loven, which she described as 'visiting my best friend once a week to talk'

Sheila Loven counseled a couple in 2009 and allegedly used her counseling influence to encourage the wife to file for divorce, then had an affair with her husband, according to prosecutors

Threatening and profane text messages sent from Loven were read out during her sexual assault trial on Wednesday.

After
the Hollidays reconciled, Loven is said to have sent them a number of 
cruel texts until they went to police and reported her for harassment.

One text message read: 'When are you going to figure out you are nothing without me. I made you into a man.'

A message to the man's wife read: 'And then he talks about your body so bad while he's touching every inch of mine.'

'I hope you enjoyed your lunch. Didn't see me did you?' another text said.

But
police turned the charge into sexual assault, saying the 47-year-old 
used her influence as a professional counselor to persuade the husband 
to have sex with her.

Wife Brenda Holliday tearfully testified to the court on Wednesday that Loven became like a best friend to her and she believed she had found the perfect counselor, describing their visits like 'going to talk to my best friend once a week'.

'There was nothing I did not tell her,' the wife testified. 'I thought 
that she genuinely cared about me and I told her how lucky I was to have
found her. She told me it was a God thing. She would always give me a 
big hug before I left.'

'It wasn't marriage counseling, it was divorce counseling,' Mrs Holliday said in court.

Mrs Holliday also revealed Loven told her that her husband was a 'narcissist' and had stopped coming to sessions and following her directions to save the marriage. All the while she was allegedly having an affair with him.

Loven's
attorney said it was a legitimate relationship which blossomed from 
romance and there is no evidence of emotional coercion.Â 

Adam Burny said: 'It had all the 
elements of any other romantic relationship. They went out to nightclubs
and dinner, and they spent almost every night together. What you will 
not see in this case is any evidence of manipulation.'

But the prosecution argued there was 
manipulation from the beginning - when she started to see them 
separately to 'collect their secrets' and then using these secrets to 
drive a wedge between them.

Loven advised the wife to get a divorce and then asked the husband on a date. Days later, the pair began having sex.

She
stopped office sessions with the husband but continued to have sex with
him, while continuing to counsel his wife, prosecutor Betty Arvin said.

'She was the ultimate inside trader,' 
Arvin said. 'She got information about their lives that they had never 
shared with anyone and she used it, she twisted it for her own sick 
reasons.'

The wife also revealed yesterday that after she filed for a divorce and told her husband to leave the house, he pleaded to be allowed to return home and would call constantly, saying he was suicidal.

The husband testified that he was so 
depressed after the divorce papers were filed that he went only to work 
and then returned home.

'I'd play Russian roulette with my .357,' the husband said. 'A couple of times I put it to my head and clicked it.'

The first night he was able to go out was when Loven invited him out to a club with her. The next day she invited him over to her house when he said she straddled him and kissed her.

According to the star Telegram he told the court: 'Sheila got up from the chair and 
straddled me and kissed me. It scared me. I hadn't 
kissed anyone except my wife for years and years.'

Mrs Holliday said that when Loven eventually confessed to her that she was the one having an affair withher husband, she said to her: 'For a year, you told me what a mess-up 
he is, and you're a licensed professional counselor.

'Why would you want him? She said everything that she said 
about him is what she loved about him. As she left, she hugged me and 
told me that she loved me.'

Testimony is scheduled to resume this morning in state District Judge Ruben Gonzalez's court.
