Selling Houses Australia's green-fingered design landscaper Charlie Albone is living every gardener's dream. 

Not only is he the LifeStyle channel's resident garden guru, father to two adorable boys and a thriving business owner, but now he will be representing Australia at the world famous Chelsea Flower Show in May.

Having volunteered to help build and exhibit a space for famous English garden designer Alan Titchmarsh at last year's show, this year it's Albone's time to shine and his very personal garden is sure to amaze.

The 33-year-old's garden design is heavily influenced by the tragic passing of his father Michael Albone when he was just 17-years-old.

With that in mind, his garden represents the three most important parts of his life, a way of expressing his personal milestones since his father passed away. 

‘He doesn't know that I was living in Australia or have a family or children or anything like that,' Albone told Daily Mail Australia.

'So I thought it would be nice to do a garden that celebrates his life and it would be a space that I could talk to him about my life.'

Albone said he was devastated when his beloved father passed away from cancer, but the strong bond his family shares got him through the tough time. 

‘It’s not easy when any loved one passes away. My sister was three years younger and my brother three years older and obviously it’s not nice for anything like that to happen. Luckily we’re a very close family and we support each other really well.'

Albone's brother now lives in Africa and his sister has set up home in Hong Kong. Both are them are flying to the UK along with his wife, mother and children to support the TV personality.

'They’re all coming back to see this garden so it means a lot,' he said.  

One of Albone's biggest regrets is that his father never got to meet his precious baby boys. 

‘It definitely would have been nice for my father to meet them and my mum loves them more than anything,' he said.  

Albone, who lives on the Central Coast with his wife Juliet Love and their two boys Leo, 2 and Hartford, 3 months, got involved in the world of landscaping and design by pure coincidence. 

Born in Hong Kong, Albone moved to England when he was 12-years-old. While out driving one day he spotted a drunk driver who had smashed into the gate of a huge country manor. 

The next day Albone returned to the house as he had taken the driver's number plate details. That was where he was offered his first job landscaping. 

By the age of 18, Albone had saved up enough money to travel to Australia, where he has been living ever since. 

While studying at TAFE, Albone received an email from The Australian Institute of Landscape  telling him he should try out for a place on a new show. Albone applied and he had been working for Selling Houses Australia ever since.

He now considers himself a pure Australian and is proud to be representing his adopted country. 

'I like to think that I'm representing Australia and the rest of my team are Australian, my training, my life my family are all in Australia,' he said. 

'I see myself as an Australian going over there rather than an Englishman going back,' 

Between working tirelessly on Selling Houses Australia for the past eight years and running his own successful business in Sydney, it's a wonder Albone has found the time to fit in the Chelsea Flower Show but he insists he could not imagine himself doing anything else.

'I get up at 4am and go to bed about 11pm.' he said. 

'I try to fit in a bit of family time but it's mainly work. I absolutely love what I do, it never feels like a chore.  

Albone will be one of eight designers showcasing their work over the course of the five day show in Chelsea. His garden will be judged against his own brief and he will also be up for the Best in Show category in the competition, His garden will  have the opportunity to be  previewed by members of the royal family.

'We’ve got our fingers crossed. I’ve said to all the guys working on the show I want our garden to be the best and do the best that they can do and if they can give me that and I can do the best that I can do.  We’ve got to be happy with the result we get,' he said.

This will be the 11th year an Australian has taken part in the Royal Horticultural Society's annual Show and Albone admits that the pressure is on. 

One of Alabone's garden designs titled 'The Time in Between,' which is based on an award winning design by Australian landscaper Phillip Johnson

In 2013 Australian landscaper Phillip Johnson won the Best in Show award for his collaboration with Trailfinders. The nature garden made history as an Australian team had never achieved such success at the show.    

Albone hopes to emulate Johnson's victory with his garden which he has called 'The Time in Between'. 

'There is a lot of pressure because the last Australian who was at Chelsea won it,' he said, 

'There’s the added pressure of being on television, people expect you to do well because they know you from TV and there’s the pressure that I put on myself. I've invested a lot of time and money into it and it will be pointless if I don’t do well.'

His intricate design will feature many Australian influences with sandstone he sourced from the Capricorn Sandstone Quarries and shipped to the UK. He will also use a range of rare plants worth over $200,000. At the moment, he has a person in the UK who is growing the plants specifically for the show. They have been sourced from Europe. 

‘I’m sure my mum’s garden will be really nice at the end of it because she’ll get it all when the show is finished,' he said.

Albone's garden design is split into three sections.The first is a meandering 2m path of huge sandstone with romantic planting on either side.

The path is meant to be wide enough so he can walk down it his father and his two kids. 

'The path is two metres wide so I can walk down it with my father and children hand in hand,' he said.  

The central section is based around a large water feature that is four and a half metres across. It empties within five seconds to represent the feeling of life slipping away. 

Albone was with his father when he passed away and he said the water feature symbolises the feeling of not being able to bring someone back, knowing what's happening to them and not being able to stop it.

Above this, hanging off the wall, will be a copper sculpture designed by Albone and young award-winning sculpture Luke Storrier.

The rear section is a sunken intimate courtyard that focuses around a dry stone fire pit, which represents Albone's wife as the centre and fire in his life. 

Not only is he the LifeStyle channel's resident garden guru, father to two adorable boys and a thriving business owner, but now he will be representing Australia at the world famous Chelsea Flower Show in May

He also has a bench in the space so he can sit with his father and tell him about his life.

Surrounding this sunken area are 17 hand-carved sandstone pillars that represent important people and family in his life, just so Albone does not forget anyone or anything when he talks to his father.

Alcone admits that the competition is strong, with such designers as Joe Thompson, who is designer for the major sponsors M&G at the Chelsea Flower Show. 

‘Everybody could win a gold medal or everybody could win silver or bronze. I would really love to win a gold medal.  I would be really happy with that. Best in Show really does just come down to the judges choice,' he said. 

The Chelsea Flower Show will be held from the 19-23 of May at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.
