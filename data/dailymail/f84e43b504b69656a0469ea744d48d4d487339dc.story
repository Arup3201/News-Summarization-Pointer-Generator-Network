Wealthy politician Clive Palmer is no longer part of the billionaire's club as his fortune has halved in the past 12 months.

The mining magnate and Palmer United Party leader's empire is reported to have dropped by $1.04 billion to $932 million, according to The Sunday Mail. 

Mr Palmer has fallen off the number one perch for the first time since 2008 in the publication's Queensland Top 150 Rich List.

Clive Palmer is no longer part of the billionaire's club as his fortune has halved in the past 12 months

The title of Queensland’s richest person now belongs to John Van Lieshout who established his Super A-Mart furniture chain into a retail giant, sold it and now heads a property empire. 

However, the annual Australian Top 200 rich list published by finance magazine BRW in June reported the MP still had held onto the billionaire title with a listed wealth of $1.2 billion. 

This comes as Mr Palmer’s former accountant and friend claims that the politician’s businesses were on the brink of bankruptcy during his Federal election campaign last year.

 

In an affidavit, Palmer's former top executive and campaigning partner Bill Schoch claims that while Mr Palmer was publicly claiming to be a billionaire, his companies were experiencing a cashflow crisis.

Mr Schoch alleges the companies were on the verge of corporate financial collapse and Mr Palmer was so desperate for funds that he accepted a settlement deal from the tax office just two days after the 2013 federal election.

Controversy seems to follow the outspoken businessman with the latest allegation coming from a former employee who claims that Mr Palmer demanded the worker be sacked after referring to him as 'fat ****'.

Peter Yates, a former assistance food and beverage manager at Palmer Coolum Resort in Queensland, lodged a claim with the Fair Work Commission against Mr Palmer after he was fired in June.

When questioned by Daily Mail Australia about the incident last week, Mr Palmer denied having any knowledge of the sacking. 

Mr Palmer owns Mineralogy, Waratah Coal, Palmer Industries, Queensland Nickel at Townsville, Palmer Coolum Resort on the Sunshine Coast, Palmer Sea Reef Golf Course at Port Douglas, Palmer Colonial Golf Course at Robina, and the Palmer Gold Coast Golf Course, also at Robina.

In April 2012, he announced that he had signed a memorandum of understanding with CSC Jinling Shipyard to construct a replica of RMS Titanic, the Titanic II which will be built in China and will set sail in late 2016. 

The colourful character also added over 100 animatronic dinosaurs to his resort in Coolum, creating a simulated Jurassic Park.
