The lead singer of the band As I Lay Dying has been sentenced to six years in prison for plotting to kill his wife.

U-T San Diego reports 33-year-old Timothy Lambesis was sentenced 
Friday in San Diego County. He had pleaded guilty to soliciting murder.

Authorities say Lambesis hired an undercover sheriff's detective to 
kill Meggan Lambesis last year.

Tim Lambesis, lead singer for the heavy metal band As I Lay Dying, has been sentenced to six years in prison for plotting to kill his wife

The singer said she had restricted his 
visits with their children after a separation, and he also was angry 
that his wife would get a large share of his income in a divorce 
settlement.

His attorney said Lambesis acted out of character and the behavior was sparked by steroid use.

As I Lay Dying was formed in San Diego in 2000. The metal band was nominated for a Grammy in 2008.

The rocker pled guilty in February to soliciting an undercover officer to murder her.

Meggan has also filed a $2 million civil suit against him, WTVA reports.

Lambesis's bandmates have announced a hiatus as he deals with his legal troubles

The rest of his band is on hiatus, and has recorded new material with another singer, Shane Bay, to be released under a different name.

'As I Lay Dying is sleeping rather than dead,' wrote bandmate Jordan Mancino. 'Tim has acknowledged his guilt and clearly made some bad decisions in a 
period of time where he acted contrary to the person he's been most of 
his life.

'He believes As I Lay Dying should only pick back up 
if it's in a form restored to its roots. For Tim, the potential of 
pursuing As I Lay Dying again means working on a lot of other more 
important things in his personal life first.'
