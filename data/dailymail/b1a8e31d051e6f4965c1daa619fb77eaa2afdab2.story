He dodged Nazi bullets on D-Day, then was shot in the leg and was unable to move for 48 hours before being rescued.

But despite risking his life for his country, 90-year-old Fred Cannon is left with just £10 a week from his war pension because the council takes the rest to pay for his care.

Yesterday the proud great-grandfather, who was 19 when he landed on Gold Beach in 1944, said: 'I think it stinks. I'm not being nasty and I'm not being funny, but I've got injuries, and they want to take it away from me.'

D-Day veteran Fred Cannon, 90, is left with just £10 a week from his war pension - the rest pays for his care

He is among thousands of injured former servicemen and women forced to pay for social care because they were injured on or before April 5, 2005.

Veterans on the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, which was introduced for those injured after April 6, 2005, do not have to pay towards their care.

The Royal British Legion is campaigning for an end to the 'profoundly unfair' system, and is calling on the Government to set aside funding so all injured veterans receive the social care they need.

Mr Cannon, of the 2nd Battalion, Essex Regiment, was seriously injured when he and his company came under Panzer attack two weeks into the Allied assault on occupied France after the Normandy landings.

He was left lying where he was until eventually being picked up by an Allied tank two days later – and was the only member of his platoon to return home alive. The injury left him with one leg shorter than the other, which has affected his mobility.

Twenty years ago, he was assessed as being 50 per cent disabled as a result of his service and was awarded a war pension as compensation. The pension is now worth £105 per week, plus a £54 mobility supplement. 

Outraged: Mr Cannon's family, pictured together on his 90th birthday, are campaigning for a rule change so free care applies to all injured soldiers, not just those hurt after 2005

Under current rules, veterans injured before April 6, 2005, must hand over most of their weekly war pension payments should they need social care.

This applies to veterans of the Second World War, Korea, the Falklands, Northern Ireland and the first Iraq War.

It is possible for councils to exempt the war pension from means testing for care costs – but only 12 per cent of authorities do so.

Servicemen wounded after April 2005 are entitled to keep all their payments because they are paid out of a different scheme – the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme.

Councils are instructed to fully exempt payments made under this programme from any means testing for social care.

Veterans injured in service on or before April 2005 receive a War Disablement Pension and are known as War Pensioners. An estimated 4,000 injured former servicemen and women across the UK are currently being forced to use war pensions to pay carers.

The Royal British Legion said some veterans are so concerned at losing their pensions if they need care they have considered moving to areas which will not take it. The Department of Health is looking at the policy and how it should be applied in the future.

The former caretaker then moved into a nursing home in Dartford, Kent after a series of falls. However his family and the British Legion say the council takes all but £10 of the £105 to pay for the nursing home costs.

He keeps the mobility payout and the council also leaves him £24.50 a week personal spending allowance, which comes from his other pensions.

Daughter-in-law Linda Cannon, 55, a primary school teacher from Dartford, said: 'I understand care needs to be paid for but the war pension is something we feel is compensation for how he suffered while fighting for our country.

'Although his heating and food is paid for at the home the extra money could be put towards him coming home for Sunday lunch in a taxi which caters to wheelchairs... [or] a specially adapted hotel for our yearly holiday to the Isle of Wight. He deserves one holiday a year while he still can.'

Mr Cannon's wife Lillian, a switchboard worker at an insurance company, died of cancer in 1996 at the age of 65. But his sons Paul, 58, a teacher, and Brian, 62, who is in insurance, are also angry about the money.

British Legion director general Chris Simpkins said: 'Not only is it unfair that war pensioners such as Mr Cannon are treated less favourably than a veteran injured at a later date, but it's also unfair that their compensation is seen as normal income in means tests for care.'

Last night MPs and other veterans' campaigners also called for an end to the loophole.

MP John Woodcock, a member of the defence select committee, said: 'We owe our lives and our freedom to men like Fred Cannon, and the nation must show it values that while the D-Day veterans are still with us.'

Falklands veteran Simon Weston said: 'The importance of people serving their country didn't begin in 2005. Everyone is entitled to fair play but the older generation of veterans is not getting that – they are being discriminated against.'

Brigadier (Ret'd) Robin Bacon, from The Soldiers' Charity, said: 'The Government has recognised that injured veterans will sometimes need a lifetime of care, and this should extend to protecting their war pensions.'

A Kent County Council spokesman said: 'We follow Government guidance when assessing people who receive war pensions and need social care. This includes the ability to exercise discretion based on individual circumstances. 

'While we cannot comment in detail on Mr Fred Cannon's circumstances, following representation by his family the council has exercised significant discretion in his case, with effect from January 2014.

'The claim that he is left with just £10 a week from his war pension is incorrect.'

A Government spokesman said: 'As part of the Armed Forces Covenant, this Government has committed to ensuring veterans get special treatment and are not disadvantaged by their service. We have been working with the British Legion to see how we can support all veterans.'

Kent County Council employs 21 senior managers earning more than £100,000 but does not cover the care costs of injured veterans like Fred Cannon.

Andrew Ireland, below right, the council's head of adult social care, the department raiding Mr Cannon's war pension, earns £178,166-a-year plus expenses. 

The highest paid member of staff is David Cockburn, corporate director of strategic and corporate services, who is paid £189,575 by the taxpayer.

The council was heavily criticised when its former chief executive Katherine Kerswell, below left, walked away with the £420,000 pay-off after just 20 months in charge.

She left after axing 1,000 jobs at a cost of almost £11million. The council's accounts revealed she had received a final year package of £589,165, including a £420,000 pay-off, £139,806 in salary and a £29,359 pension contribution.

Within months she was made the Cabinet Office's director-general for civil service reform on a salary of £142,000 a year – just £500 less than the Prime Minister.
