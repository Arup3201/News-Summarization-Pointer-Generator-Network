Teenagers are not supposed to do this kind of thing any more. In tennis, we hear, everyone has to wait until their early-to-mid-twenties to properly develop their talent. The ages of the top-ranked players back that argument up.

But try telling it to Nick Kyrgios, the 19-year-old painter and decorator’s son from Australia’s unfashionable capital of Canberra, after he blitzed Rafael Nadal on his Centre Court debut.

The old arena has probably not seen a statement like that since Boris Becker’s extraordinary breakthrough in 1985, when the 17-year-old terrified the life out of his elders and betters.

Upstage: Nick Kyrgios celebrates beating Rafael Nadal in the tournament's biggest shock

Adios: Nadal waves goodbye after being beaten by the younger man in the fourth round

Perhaps a more recent comparison is a 19-year-old Roger Federer beating Pete Sampras at this same fourth-round stage in 2001.

The emerging Swiss was by then already ranked 15 in the world, although Sampras’s Wimbledon pedigree was more substantial than Nadal’s.

This had a similar mark of nerveless youth, of someone unrestrained by understanding the potential scale of the achievement. It was certainly a more sensational result than its only statistical rival of the past 25 years, world No 1 Jim Courier’s 1992 ousting by the Russian journeyman Andrei Olhovskiy, who then languished at 193.

There is more of a premium these days on core strength and stamina, which is why the era of the wunderkind is meant to be over, and why so many players are enjoying their career highs in their late twenties, even early thirties.

Eyes on the prize: Kyrgios will need to show more focus than other Australian teen-wonders to succeed

Kyrgios has rendered that irrelevant with his golden arm, so quick and loose he makes that of compatriot Mitchell Johnson seem like the limb of a medium pace trundler.

Australian tennis will celebrate the arrival of Kyrgios. Once the cradle of champions, the game there in recent years has been on life support compared to the old glory days.

Bernard Tomic has been little but trouble since making the Wimbledon quarter-final at 18 in 2011, and Sam Stosur’s US Open triumph the same year has also proved to be a false dawn.

Another Aussie teenager, Thanasi Kokkinakis, is reckoned to be of a similar potential to Kyrgios.

Feeling the heat: Nadal's grass court reputation has been damaged by several upsets in recent years

Potential: Kyrgios was world junior number one before turning professional last year

As for Nadal, he will welcome the extended three-week gap next year between Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

His two grass court Grand Slam titles are becoming buried under a mound of upsets on the surface.

As he gets older and the body becomes less co-operative, his Paris exertions are proving too much to recover from.
