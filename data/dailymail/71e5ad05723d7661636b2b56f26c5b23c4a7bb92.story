A West Australian radio boss who says she keeps a jar of free condoms in the office for staff has been defended by former employees.

Southern Cross Austereo general manager Linda Wayman told a conference in Perth last week that 35 per cent of her staff were either on maternity leave or covering those on leave.

Ms Wayman said there was a big jar of condoms at work and she encouraged people to have protected sex.

Chief executive Rhys Holleran said Ms Wayman's comments were made 'tongue in cheek' while former colleagues defended her as a 'supportive boss' in the wake of widespread condom controversy.

One of Southern Cross Austereo's senior executives Linda Wayman told a conference on Thursday that 'We do have a big jar of condoms at work. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating'

It is allegedly vital for Ms Wayman to prevent pregnancies amongst her staff members. 'That is a big area of focus for me, encouraging people to have sex with condoms,' she said

'We do have a big jar of condoms at work. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating,' she said, according to Mumbrella.

'I do encourage people regularly, to have sex with condoms.That is a big area of focus for me, encouraging people to have sex with condoms.' 

To emphasise the impact on the company, Ms Wayman told the audience that one third of her 100 staff members are either on maternity leave or covering for someone who has just had a child.

She also allegedly told the Mumbrella Perth conference that she has reservations about the entitlements that new mothers receive when re-entering the workforce.

Ms Wayman also said she didn't agree with the union push that women returning from maternity leave should come back part-time automatically because it was an idealistic and anti-commercial stance, however maternity contracts played an important role in developing young talent.

The radio boss said she believed in flexible working arrangements but they were difficult to arrange in the 24-hour media industry.

'I've been in the same position myself twice and it is very, very tough,' she said.

'There's no such thing as a work/life balance, it's bulls**t - you just do it.

'You make the decision and do the best you can, and as a leader, I do the best I can to help women and men who have made those decisions as well.' 

Ms Wayman told the audience that of her 100 staff a third are either on maternity leave or covering for someone who has just had a child to emphasise the impact on the company

However, Ms Wayman's comments, which drew laughter and applause at the conference, attracted criticism after they were reported on Thursday.

Former employees jumped to her defence, describing her as a supportive boss.

Perth TV reporter Lisa Fernandez told AAP Ms Wayman was 'tremendous' when she fell pregnant at the start of her two-year contract at radio station Mix 94.5.

'She said "don't even worry, we will make this work, we will help you all we can",' Ms Fernandez said.

'She always came in to check that I was getting home OK on time to see the baby and she would always check in with me to say "is everything OK?".'

Ms Fernandez said Ms Wayman's door was always open to talk about any sort of parenting issue and she would bend over backwards to help employees, such as letting them leave early or getting them into a job-sharing role.

Fairfax Media 6PR breakfast presenter Basil Zempilas tweeted he had never seen a boss more supportive of women in the workplace than Ms Wayman.

Ms Wayman said that she has reservations about the entitlements that new mothers receive when re-entering the workforce, calling them 'idealistic and anti-commercial'

Southern Cross Austereo's CEO Rhys Holleran said that Ms Wayman's comments were not intended to be taken seriously

Southern Cross Austereo's CEO Rhys Holleran defeneded Ms Wayman, insisting that her comments were not meant to have been taken seriously.

'Clearly these remarks were made "tongue in cheek",', Mr Holleran said in the statement.

'Linda is one of our most highly recognised and awarded General Managers.

'She has an exemplary record as one of Perth's most compassionate advocates on all issues surrounding equality of women in the workforce.'

Another SCA Perth staff member, who preferred not to be named, told Daily Mail Australia that the reports are sad and not a true reflection of the General Manager's attitude towards women in the work force.

'Linda is a great advocate for women's issues so this is so unfortunate,' the SCA employee said.

'She is highly respected and wonderful in her role.'

The SCA CEO said the comments are tongue in cheek and '(Wayman) has an exemplary record as one of Perth's most compassionate advocates on all issues surrounding equality of women in the workforce'
