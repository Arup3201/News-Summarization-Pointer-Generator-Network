Alexis Sanchez will attend bi-weekly English lessons as his settling-in period at Arsenal begin in earnest.

The Chile international sealed his £30million move from Barcelona in a whirlwind two-hour stay in London on Wednesday afternoon.

The 25-year-old speaks no English and had conducted his in-house media duties through the aid of an interpreter.

But the club have organised a Spanish speaking English teacher to help Sanchez grasp the language as quickly as possible.

The South American will be expected to attend classes at least twice a week.

Spanish speaking players Mikel Arteta, Nacho Monreal and Santi Cazorla will also be asked to help Sanchez communicate with his team-mates while he learns English.

Likewise, manager Arsene Wenger also speaks Spanish which will help Sanchez overcome the language barrier during the opening months of his Arsenal career.
