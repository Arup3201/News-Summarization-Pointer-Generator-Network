Popular Channel Ten show The Project has been left in hot water over comments comedian Kitty Flanagan made on last night's show, claiming Santa Claus is not real

The segment was Kitty's final appearance on the show and she certainly bowed out in style. 

Kitty spoke on the 6:30pm show about scientists who study the big man in the red suit, claiming they must be drunk to believe Santa exists.

'How else do you explain intelligent, educated, folks studying Santa - a man that doesn't even exist,' she said. 

A gasp could be heard from the audience when Kitty made the controversial claims live on air

Carrying on with her segment, Flanagan appears unaware of the backlash that's to come, as she  digs a further hole for herself, claiming both Santa and Jesus are figments of our imagination.

‘Aw sorry spoiler alert,' she said.

'If you have kids in the room you should probably have covered their ears and gone la la la,'

The Project issued a grovelling apology to the fans on their Twitter and Facebook page

The show confirmed that they will be crossing to Santa in the North Pole on tonight's show so they can 'clear up any confusion' for their younger viewers

'My point is that if you want to study a Christmassy man that doesn't exist, surely Jesus comes in at number one'

A gasp could be heard from the audience as the comedian attempted to wrangle herself out of the sticky situation.

However the damage was done and disappointed parents made sure their feelings were known.

Taking to The Project's Facebook page, a number of outraged parents left comments aimed at Kitty, with some even calling for the comedian to be fired. 

'My youngest was just putting the angel on top of the Christmas tree when Kitty decided to spoil her Christmas. Lesson learned, I will no longer watch the project.' Ruby J Loveday said. 

Another parent Megan Howitt said her 7-year-old was distressed because 'they said on the news that Santa isn't real'.

One parent claimed Kitty had crossed the line this time. She said her 7-year-old is devastated following the show

'Don’t listen to Kitty kids. Her researchers must have failed her. Clearly there’s a Santa. No pressies for Flano though.#apologies' The Project team said on Twitter. 

'Last night’s comments by Kitty were completely unplanned and we unreservedly apologise for upsetting our family viewers,' their Facebook post said. 

'Last night was Kitty’s final performance on The Project but neither she nor our show would intentionally offend kids like this just before Christmas'

The show confirmed that they will be crossing to Santa in the North Pole on tonight's show so they can 'clear up any confusion' for their younger viewers.
