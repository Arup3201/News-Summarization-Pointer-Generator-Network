The company has agreed to rebrand its 'eco superstar' 

A major lightbulb producer has given way and agreed to stop branding old-fashioned products as ‘eco’ bulbs.

The Daily Mail revealed last month that Osram and Philips, two of the biggest manufacturers of lightbulbs, were selling basic halogen bulbs with ‘eco’ branding.

Consumer groups accused the firms of trying to ‘greenwash’ their products, encouraging people to buy them because they think they are more environmentally friendly and could save them money.

But in reality halogen bulbs are among the least energy efficient bulbs widely available today.

They have been surpassed by several technologies including LEDs and compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs - some of which will burn ten times less energy.

Now, just weeks after the Mail’s expose, Osram has agreed to rebrand its ‘Eco Superstar’ bulb as ‘Halogen Classic’.

Christian Boelling, a spokesman for the Germany-based firm said: ‘We have decided not to use the term ‘Eco’ for our halogen products any more.

‘This change will be implemented in the course of an already planned packaging change.

‘The advantages of dedicated lamp types will still be communicated in the future. This includes longer lifetime, the possibility of disposal in household waste and better light quality. The adjustment will be implemented as soon as possible.’

Previously Osram had tried to insist that Eco stood for ‘economy’ as well as ‘ecology’ - reflecting the cheaper price of the halogen bulb.

But the firm has now changed its stance. Mr Boelling said: ‘From our point of view, the term ‘Eco’ is not crucial for our customers.

‘For this reason we decided not to use it anymore.’

Philips, however, is continuing to sell its EcoClassic bulb. A spokesman said consumers are given enough information on packets to make an informed decision.

The Energy Saving Trust estimates that replacing every halogen bulb with LEDs will save a family £40 a year in electricity bills.

Philips EcoClassic bulb and Osram Classic Eco Superstar bulb each only earn an energy label grade of C or D, the third and fourth out of five efficiency bands.

The Energy Saving Trust estimates that replacing every halogen bulb with LEDs will save a family £40 a year in electricity bills.

They will last just 2000 hours and consume ten times more energy than the latest LED technology, researchers say.

Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a think tank in London, said: ‘Low-energy lightbulbs are one of the success stories of recent years, saving British households about a billion pounds per year and helping to reduce the carbon emissions that are changing our climate.

‘So it’s great that Osram has seen sense and put consumers back in charge of their energy saving. We would urge other companies still using misleading labels to follow suit and help consumers make informed choices about their energy bills and carbon emissions.’
