Mario Balotelli was reportedly dumped by Belgian model Fanny Neguesha because he objected to her sexy mag poses.

The Italian striker proposed to the 22-year-old beauty at last year's World Cup in Brazil with a £25,000 sparkler.

However, the relationship proved short lived as Fanny returned the engagement ring after he demanded she quit modelling.

Fanny revealed on Italian TV: 'He didn't want to see me in photoshoots - or singing and dancing.

'I tried to explain to him that I had a career as well. But he just wouldn't listen. Looking back maybe I was a bit too hasty.

'I should have taken a bit more time and thought about it before I accepted his proposal.

'He was a hard head and couldn't accept  I wanted my own career path as well.

'In the end I returned the engagement ring to him. He was upset but we have both moved on now.'
