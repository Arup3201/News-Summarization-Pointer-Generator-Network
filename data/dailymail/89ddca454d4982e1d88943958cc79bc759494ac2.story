Scotland Yard staff felt under pressure to find a job for the daughter of News of the World executive Neil Wallis after a top officer said he was a ‘great friend’ of the force, the police watchdog said yesterday.

In a withering assessment of the close links between the police and the newspaper, it was claimed ‘professional boundaries became blurred, imprudent decisions taken and poor judgment shown by senior police personnel’.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission said former Met Assistant Commissioner John Yates passed the CV of Mr Wallis’s daughter Amy to human resources director Martin Tiplady in January 2009.

Probe: The investigation dismissed claims former assistant commissioner John Yates, left, helped secure a job for Amy Wallis, right, the daughter of PR consultant Neil Wallis 

According to emails between the two, 
the News of the World deputy editor was viewed as a ‘great friend’ to 
the force, a ‘close adviser’ to then Met Commissioner Paul Stephenson 
and a ‘powerful opinion-former’ prior to his arrest last year on 
suspicion of phone hacking.

Although the force was making job 
cuts, Miss Wallis was employed in June 2009 without a formal interview 
and apparently without any references being taken up.

She is still 
employed by the force, although her position has not been disclosed.

The IPCC report said the email chain 
was perceived by more junior staff to be an instruction to find a job 
for Miss Wallis, and that this should have been foreseeable to both Mr 
Yates and Mr Tiplady.

Concerns: Former Met Police communications chief Dick Fedorcio, who resigned last month, was told he had a case to answer over the hiring of Neil Wallis, right. Mr Wallis's daughter Amy had no formal interview before being employed by the force in 2009

Scandal: Senior Met Police staff appeared to have been oblivious to the perception of conflict amid the phone hacking scandal, the police watchdog said

It added: ‘Whether or not it was 
“routine” for senior officers to pass on CVs it was poor judgment to do 
so, bearing in mind the appearance of favouritism.’

Months later when Neil Wallis left the News of the World he was handed a £24,000 contract to provide PR work for the force.

Concerned: Deborah Glass from the IPCC said senior people appeared to have been 'oblivious to the perception of conflict' amid the phone hacking scandal

Yesterday’s report said the decision 
to employ him between October 2009 and September 2010 breached policy 
and damaged public confidence in the police, although it found no 
evidence of corruption.

It found there was a case to answer of
misconduct in relation to the Met’s former director of public affairs, 
Dick Fedorcio, who tried to short-circuit the recruitment process and 
asked Mr Wallis to do work for the Met before a contract was agreed. Mr 
Fedorcio resigned last month.

Mr Yates resigned in July last year 
after he came under fire for his handling of the phone-hacking inquiry 
and close friendship with Mr Wallis, although the IPCC concluded there 
was no evidence of misconduct.

Scotland Yard said: ‘The Metropolitan 
Police Service has been the subject of much external scrutiny ... and 
the review recommended by the IPCC will form part of our wider 
response.’

Mr Yates said it was ‘common practice’ within the Met to 
refer friends and relatives.

Siegel, who represents 20 families of victims of the 2001 outrage.
