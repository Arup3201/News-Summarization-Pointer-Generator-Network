I'm getting to know Stuart Pearce at this World Cup while working with him for talkSPORT.

In his autobiography he confessed to not being a huge fan of the press and detailed how they had stitched him up as a player. In his coaching role with the England Under 21s the press regularly laid into him and that appears to have left its mark on Pearce.

I’m not sure if his view of the media will ever recover from the pounding it took when he left David Beckham out of the GB squad for the Olympics.

Back in the day: Stuart Pearce was in charge of the England Under 21 side for six years until 2013

So in my position, embarking on any conversation with Pearce feels like a non-starter – if you’re a member of the media you have to prove something to him before he starts to trust you. It’s hard for him I guess but he should shake off those pre-conceived notions of people just because of the industry they work in, especially when judging people he hasn’t previously met. 

It’s been hard work at times, talking to Pearce, but it’s been worth it in the end. I couldn’t care less if he likes me or not, as long as we work well together that’s my priority. I don’t need any Christmas cards off him. But I do want to learn from his vast experience. He played in semi finals of major tournaments so of course there are a million questions to ask him.

And as time has gone on, he’s eased down the drawbridge and I’ve been happy to listen to his football knowledge and ask questions. I admired Stuart greatly as a player, and now I’ve found him to be a good laugh at times. It’s fair to say I don’t always agree with him on everything though.

After watching Germany’s World Cup win this week he made a fantastic point that I’m going to throw out there, to see what you think.

Safe hands: Manuel Neuer has established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world

Defensive duties: Jerome Boateng (left) and Mats Hummels both came through the Under 21 set-up

The Germany team that beat Portugal 4-0 
featured six players who started for their Under 21 side in the European Championships final in Sweden back in 2009. Manuel Neuer, Jerome 
Boateng, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira, Mesut Ozil and Benedikt Howedes 
were all victors over Pearce’s England that night in Malmo. Others from 
that young Germany side in 2009 switched allegiance: Fabian Johnson 
played for their USA in their win over Ghana on Monday; Sebastian 
Boenisch played for Poland at Euro 2012.

So let’s get this right – eight of the 11 who started for Germany in their Euro under 21 final win over England in 2009 have gone on to play at a major, senior international tournament and six of them started for Germany against Portugal on Monday and won 4-0.

That is how it should be – the junior side feeding the talent to the senior side.

The England side from back in 2009 may have lost heavily, but at least made it to the final. Of that starting line up only James Milner is at this World Cup. Joe Hart would have started but he was suspended for the final in Sweden.

Chance: Mesut Ozil played for Real Madrid before joining Arsenal for £42million last summer

Progression: Sami Khedira (left) and Benedikt Howedes (right with Thomas Muller) also played in 2009

So what of
 the rest? Fabrice Muamba’s career ended in near-tragic circumstances. 
Scott Loach, Lee Cattermole, Mark Noble, Nedum Onouha and Martin Crainie
 never went on to play for England. Adam Johnson and Micah Richards have
 massively under-achieved in their careers so far and need to work much 
harder. Kieran Gibbs has talent, but needs to do more to convince Arsene
 Wenger he’s Arsenal’s first choice left-back. And the other was Theo 
Walcott who but for injury would have been at this World Cup. 

So
 only two England players from that Under 21 side have progressed to 
become England regulars in the starting line-up – Walcott and Hart while
 Milner is a squad regular. Compared to the German side that is 
pathetic. 

For
 Pearce, players and clubs not taking junior international football 
seriously is a major issue, and those six German players prove his 
point. Only a year ago Phil Jones and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain both 
thought they were too good for the Under 21s.

Pulling out of the Under 21s has been a feature of English football for years now; who can forget the farce in the summer of 2011 when both Andy Carroll and Jack Wilshere withdrew from Pearce’s squad. By now Wilshere should be a certain starter for England when fit, but his development has been restricted – just ask Paul Scholes. As for Carroll, well a talent that looked effective at Euro 2012 now looks like a spent force. Another one who needs to work harder.

Lone survivors: Only James Milner (left) and Joe Hart remain from England's 2009 Under 21 side

Who knows 
if a bigger commitment to the Under 21s and below would have turned 
England into more of a force at World Cups and European Championships 
over the years?

Pearce clearly believes it’s a major factor in our lack of success.

Last
 week David Bentley announced his retirement aged just 29, he even 
started crying over it. Back in 2007 Bentley thought he was too good for
 the England Under 21s and pulled out of the European Championships 
squad. An extremely talented player, but without the mental strength to 
realise how to make a success of being a top level footballer, who could
 make an impact at World Cups.

Back in 2007, Bentley said: 'We need strong characters in the England team'. He should have pointed that high-powered perception at himself.

What a waste of talent. 

Whether
 you like him or not, whether you think he’s a good manager or not, 
Stuart Pearce is absolutely right to point out how the commitment to the
 Under 21s in Germany has helped their senior side.

Not pushed on: Andy Carroll failed to make the England squad while Jack Wilshere has yet to establish himself
