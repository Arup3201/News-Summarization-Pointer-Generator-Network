Drunk driver: Dorota Wysoczanska, 36, was at more than twice the legal drink-drive limit when she took a wrong exist onto the A14 dual carriageway

A drunk nurse who drove her Mini Cooper twenty miles down a dual carriageway in the wrong direction at 3.30am has walked free from court.

Dorota Wysoczanska, 36, turned down an exit lane onto the A14 outside Newmarket, Suffolk, and continued through Bury St Edmunds at around 60mph until she was stopped by a rolling police roadblock.

Wysoczanska, who was at more than twice the drink-drive limit, had earlier driven past several patrol cars which had tried to pull her over during the incident on Boxing Day last year.

A hearing at Ipswich Crown Court heard that Wysoczanska was fleeing a violent encounter with her boyfriend at the time, and trying to get home to Ashford, Kent when she entered the main road the wrong way.

Lori Tucker, prosecuting, said passed turn-offs and lay-bys and didn't stop, and was only brought to a halt when two police cars closed the road in front of her.

Tests showed the repeat offender had 75mcgs of alcohol in 100mls of breath. The legal limit is 35mcgs.

Wysoczanska  admitted dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol. The court also heard she had a previous drink-driving conviction from 2008.

She was given a two-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and a 40-month driving ban.

Wysoczanska will also have to take an extended retest to regain her licence, and must pay £120 in costs.

Recorder Jonathan Seely said she was very fortunate that traffic had been so light at the time, and branded her driving 'highly dangerous'.

Mr Seely said he accepted she had been 'distressed' after allegedly being assaulted by her partner on Christmas Day night as they stayed with friends in King's Lynn, Norfolk.

But he said that even if she had a genuine reason for wanting to get away from him she should not have got behind the wheel after downing the amount of alcohol she had that night.

Steven Dyble, defending, said 
Wysoczanska was a nurse and had lost her job which involved driving in 
the community as a result of the terrifying incident.

Mr Dyble said she had got a new post working with dementia patients which let her use public transport.

He said she had been assaulted by her boyfriend and had fled the house where they were staying to drive after he had fallen asleep. Mr Dyble added that she had been relying on the sat nav in her car to find her way home.

He said that after missing the right turning on to the A14 she'd taken the next one which took her the wrong way on to the usually busy route.

Mr Dyble said that because Wysoczanska was travelling the wrong way there were no signs indicating lay-bys or turn offs and she had panicked.

He said that once she realised her catastrophic blunder she flashed her headlights and turned on her hazard lights in a bid to warn shocked motorists heading straight towards her.
