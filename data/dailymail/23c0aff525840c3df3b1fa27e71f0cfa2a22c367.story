A woman with cancer delayed potentially life-saving treatment for fear it would harm her chances of becoming a mother.

When Nicola Cockx did become pregnant she bravely continued to postpone chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant for the sake of her unborn child.

Instead she fought multiple myeloma – a form of bone marrow cancer which affects plasma cells – by studying nutrition and concentrating on a healthy diet.

Nicola Cockx, 35, was so desperate to have a child she delayed cancer treatment so she could have her daughter Harriet. The young mother died eight months after the child's birth

After her daughter was born, Mrs Cockx 
finally underwent intensive treatment. But she died aged 35 from an 
infection when Harriet was just eight months old.

The family of Mrs 
Cockx – described as ‘beautiful, courageous and determined’ – believe 
that if she had had chemotherapy she would have survived, but never had 
the child she longed for.

The businesswoman of Little Bollington near
 Altrincham, Cheshire, had fought a three-year battle against cancer by 
the time she became pregnant in 2011.

Mrs Cockx, a businesswoman, was first diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 2008. She sought holistic remedies rather than conventional methods as she wanted to protect her fertility

Around 4,800 cases of multiple 
myeloma are diagnosed in this country every year, representing about 1 
per cent of all cancers.

It affects places in the body where there is 
bone marrow, causing abnormal cells to build up and leading to 
infections and fractures.

Mrs Cockx was initially treated with 
radiotherapy in her hip but also sought alternative medication and 
therapy, her husband Rudy, 39, an IT consultant, told a Manchester 
inquest.

She did a course in nutrition at Manchester University and 
even talked of contacting Jamie Oliver for advice.

But she refused 
aggressive treatment in the hope of preserving her fertility and 
fulfilling her dream of becoming a mother, the inquest heard.

Dr Jim 
Cavet, her consultant at Christie Hospital in Manchester, said she 
hadn’t wanted chemotherapy even though the cancer was threatening her 
spinal cord, so she was given steroids instead.

‘Her real priority was preserving her fertility as much as possible,’ he said.

She
 also backed out of an autologous stem cell transplant – where a 
patient’s stem cells are removed and blasted with chemotherapy – for 
fear the toxins would affect her chances of becoming pregnant.

Dr Cavet 
said that despite her decisions, she fought the cancer off and went into
 a period of remission.

Mrs Cockx was overjoyed to become pregnant and continued to opt out of treatment that might harm Harriet.

The baby was born by emergency caesarean in June 2012, but tests showed the cancer was much stronger than before.

Dr
 Cavet said Mrs Cockx was still reluctant to have any chemotherapy. But 
by now she was weeks away from death, so she finally had chemotherapy 
and a full donor stem cell transplant.

Mrs Cockx pictured with husband Rudy, 39. The mother - who had an avid interest in fitness - fought off the cancer and was in remission in 2011 when she fell pregnant with her first child

‘If it wasn’t for this she would have only had a month or so to live,’ the consultant said.

‘Only because she was so young and fit did she get to the point of delivering the baby.’

While
 in hospital that October she started a blog, telling friends about a 
‘Sex and the City’ moment when she was given ice lollies to ease the 
sore mouth caused by chemotherapy like Samantha in the US sitcom when 
she had cancer.

The businesswoman gave birth to her healthy daughter Harriet in June 2012. However, during her pregnancy the disease spread - and she underwent emergency chemotherapy after the birth

She also wrote excitedly about cuddling Harriet during visits and speaking to her via Skype.

The
 transplant initially seemed to work, but Mrs Cockx started to 
experience side effects and in  February 2013 was referred to Salford 
Hospital.

She was discharged but died four days later from sepsis and a drug-related inflammation of the heart.

Recording
 a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Sara Lewis said: ‘Nicola’s main 
concern was her fertility and that she should have a child, and of 
course she did in 2012.

Following the birth of her daughter, Mrs Cockx also had a stem cell transplant. Recording a narrative verdict, a coroner said the new mother died of myocarditis - a heart condition caused by the drugs used in her treatment

'Clearly it is very tragic that the stem cell 
transplant could not provide a longer remission for her.

‘It is also 
right to say she was a very engaged and intelligent young woman who 
liked to explore all the information she could obtain to take care of 
her health.’

The family are now raising money for more research into the illness.

They
 declined to comment after the hearing, but mother Patricia Flowers said
 on a Just Giving online page: ‘Nicola’s determination to find a way to 
fight this horrible disease by natural methods was inspirational. Her 
end goal was to survive and have a family. That was all she wanted.

Mrs Cockx's family paid tribute to the 'inspirational' woman - saying they we 'so proud' of her. They are now raising money to raise awareness and fund research in to the rare form of cancer

‘She
 was a very well-informed and intelligent young woman and her journey 
led her on to an holistic route that worked for her for four years.’

According
 to Cancer Research UK, chemotherapy is considered safe during pregnancy
 except during the first 14 weeks or in the weeks leading to delivery, 
but  more research is being done on any long-term impact on the child 
following birth.

 Multiple
 myeloma is a cancer arising from plasma cells, a type of white blood 
cell made in the bone marrow.  Bone marrow is the ‘spongy’ material 
found in the centre of the larger bones in the body - and where all 
blood cells are made.

About 1
 person in 200 will develop myeloma at some time in their life (about 
5,000 people are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year in the UK). 
The most common age at which people are diagnosed with the disease is 
72.

The main types of 
treatment are chemotherapy and for patients who are otherwise fit and 
well, stem cell transplantation. Radiotherapy may also be given.

While
 myeloma is very treatable, there is currently no cure. However, 
survival of myeloma patients has improved at a faster rate than any 
other cancer in the UK in the last 10 years, mainly due to the 
availability of new drugs, according to the charity Myeloma UK.

Figures
 from the Office for National Statistics showed that around 40 per cent 
of patients in England live for at least 5 years. It was also estimated 
that between 15 – 19 per cent of patients will live for at least 10 
years.
