Following her 11-hour filibuster of a severe abortion bill in Texas, state Sen. Wendy Davis responded to Gov. Rick Perry's personal criticism of her action, saying the Republican governor 'demeaned' his office with the comments.

'I didn't have an angry response to it on behalf of myself, I think it just demonstrated the typical attitude that governor Perry has expressed toward this issue,' Davis said on CNN Friday.

Earlier last week, Davis filibustered a legislation that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks and establish new regulations on providers of abortions, limiting the amount to just five.

Conference: At an anti-abortion conference after Davis' filibuster, Texas Gov. Rick Perry questioned if the state senator had learned the right lesson about the issue from her own background

After the successful action, Perry spoke at a national 'Right to Life' conference noting Davis' personal history did not affect her stance on abortion.

'The fact is, who are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances can't grow to live successful lives?' Perry had said. 'In fact, even the woman who filibustered the Senate the other day was born into difficult circumstances.

'She was the daughter of a single woman. She was a teenage mother herself. She managed to eventually graduate from Harvard Law School and serve in the Texas senate,' Perry continued. 'It's just unfortunate that she hasn't learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to realize its full potential and that every life matters.'

Davis told Wolf Blitzer said that the comments were 'symptomatic' of Perry's perspective on women's rights. She said the governor has desire to 'see big government intrude upon those very private matters'.

Blitzer noted Perry was invited to join Davis on the program but did not come on. He asked Davis what she would say directly to Perry about his remarks.

'Governor Perry, if you truly care about women's health, let's do something to make sure that we're protecting them,' Davis said. 'Let's make sure we're preventing unplanned pregnancies and that we're committing resources to make that happen.'

She asked Perry to work for 'age appropriate' sex education in the Texas school system.

'And let's stop demonizing women who face very difficult choices in their life,' Davis said. 'Let's make sure we don't close down 37 of the 42 clinics in Texas and leave women with no where to go and put them in a situation where their health will be at risk.'

Davis cited the American College of Gynecology and Obstetrics' qualms with the bill, which was also opposed by The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, according to Salon.

'They believe it endangers women's health because it's putting us back in an era that we've been before,' Davis said.'And we know what happens when women in impoverished settings who can't access care turn to.'

Davis also said that Perry—and other lawmakers—'do know' closing abortion clinics doesn't stop them from occurring.

In explaining his actions, Perry's office told CNN he was 'praising Sen. Davis for her success despite coming from difficult circumstances, and that should be an inspiration to others'.After her filibuster of the bill, Davis come into the national spotlight this week. She was praised by pro-abortion advocates and hundreds of protestors filled the Capitol building during her filibuster Tuesday.

While Davis meant to monopolize the final 13 hours of the Texas legislature's session, she was interrupted after 10 hours and 45 minutes by Republican colleagues who said she violated the rules by going off-topic and using a back brace to keep her standing. Republicans tried to finish the vote before midnight—seemingly attempting to edit records when they were unable to do so—but the bill was eventually deemed dead.Perry called for a special session Monday in order to pass the bill, but Davis told The Huffington Post she still has hope it won't pass in the Republican-dominated legislature.'I think that there are certainly some members across the aisle that are giving this a second thought,' Davis said. 'And I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to anything I said or did. But the reaction that they're seeing—the very organic reaction that they're seeing from across the state of Texas, I think it's giving some people pause, as it should.'
