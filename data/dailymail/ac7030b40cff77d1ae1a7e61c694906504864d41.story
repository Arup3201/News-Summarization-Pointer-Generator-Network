Ms Leismann and her boyfriend Charles Cook had just picked up their 13-year-old son TJ from middle school and were on their way to pick up their younger daughter when the accident happened.

'I jumped out the car and said, "What the hell is wrong with you, you’re in a school zone, what are you thinking?"' Ms Leismann told NBC DFW.

After losing her 4-year-old son Jaylen to epilepsy last year, Leismann says she was spurred to action at the thought of another one of her children dying.

The chase started Wednesday afternoon around 3:30pm when Drecelus Hunter was carjacked at gunpoint at a convenience store by Alexander.

'I walked up to the car and he pointed the gun at me,' Hunter told WFAA of the moment Alexander stole his white Dodge Challenger.

Ms Leismann's 13-year-old son TJ was in the car at the time of the accident and they were waiting at an intersection in a school zone

Robbery suspect Alexander store the white Dodge Challenger at a convenience store and proceeded on a high speed chase for 20 minutes before coming to a stop

Police arrested Alexander and booked him in the Dallas County Jail on charged of aggravated assault and resisting arrest

He allegedly kept telling Ms Leismann to let him go while she was throwing hits at the scene of the crash  

Ms Leismann's boyfriend (in striped hoodie) mostly acted as a buffer between his girlfriend and Alexander  

Alexander then went on a 20-minute high-speed chase with police that ended at the intersection where Ms Leismann was waiting.

Alexander clearly didn't know what he was getting into when Ms Leismann came barreling out of the driver's seat to the car.

'I think he ran up against a mama bear,' an officer at the scene said.

Ms Leismann's boyfriend got out of the car as well to confront Alexander but mostly acted as a buffer between the two.

'She was yelling at the dude, "Look what you did to my car! Look what you did to my car!"' Cook said. 'And I could hear him saying, "Just let me go, let me go!" And she was like, "No, you're not going nowhere! Look what you just did to my car!"

'I was yelling all kinds of things that I may not remember... but I hope he does,' Liesmann said. 

Ms Leismann's 13-year-old son TJ (left) says he's proud of his mother. Ms Leismann's 4-year-old son Jaylen died last August after struggling with epilepsy 

ms Leismann's boyfriend Charles Cook (right) was also with her at the time of the crash 

'She's a fighter. Once she gets mad, it's over,' Mr Cook said of his girlfriend.

Ms Leismann threw Alexander to the ground one last time before police swarmed around to make an arrest.

She then went to comfort her son who appeared to be shaken up from the crash.

TJ was later taken to the hospital for evaluation. 

He told reporters he wasn't surprised at all that his mom would have jumped to his defense.

'My mom did put him in his place,' TJ said. 'I’m glad he is in jail because to be honest when I was in the car, I thought I died.'

Alexander was booked in the Dallas County Jail and is expected to be charged with aggravated robbery and evading arrest.
