Singer Cher has petitioned a court to allow a 96-year-old woman to return to her home in northern Virginia. 

Edith Hill was taken away from her new 95-year-old husband last year after a court accepted she did not have the mental capacity to enter into a marriage. 

However, the 68-year-old singer was so moved by the story of Mrs Hill and Eddie Harrison that she has pledged to help Mrs Hill return home.

A court ruled that Edith Hill, left should be removed from her home and transferred to Florida. Her husband Eddie Harrison remained at home in Virginia but later died a couple of weeks after they were split apart 

Unfortunately Mr Harrison died several weeks after his wife was taken away. 

However, Cher was inspired by the story and decided to act on behalf of Mrs Hill and see whether it was feasible to return her to her long-term home. 

A judge in McClean, Virginia has ruled that Mrs Hill should be returned home following Cher's commitment.   

Mr Harrison died in December, just weeks after Hill was taken away to Florida on the recommendation of a court-appointed guardian, but a custody dispute continued over who should care for Hill and where she should live.

Cher said she will help pay for needed upgrades to Hill's family home in Alexandria.

In a telephone interview, Cher expressed frustration that Eddie and Edith had been split up against their wishes.

She said: 'This whole thing is a travesty, what happens to old people. Once they do the repairs and she comes back home, it's going to be bittersweet because she only wanted to be with him.'

Earlier this month, after Cher offered to pay for the home improvements, a judge ordered that Hill should return to Alexandria once repairs are complete.

Mrs Hill's daughter Rebecca Wright said: 'Mom's coming home!' Mrs Hill was in favour of her mother's marriage to Mr Harrison. Mr Harrison and Mrs Hill had been companions for more than a decade before they got married. 

In December, the court ruled that Mrs Hill should be moved to Florida and later that same month, Mr Harrison died. 

Mrs Wright said: 'He actually gave his life to this effort.' 

She said Mr Harrison became depressed after Mrs Hill was taken away as he thought it was unlikely that they would ever see each other again. 

Cher became aware of the case when a TV news broadcast showed the couple dancing. 

The singer said she would pay for any repairs inside the Alexandria home and ensure it was suitable for a 96-year-old woman. She also pledged to help with her ongoing medical bills.

Cher saw a documentary about the couple when Mrs Hill was taken to Florida. She said she was impressed by how in love the pair seemed to be and was outraged over their treatment. 

She added: 'I think this is an important story. It's not right what is going on.'
