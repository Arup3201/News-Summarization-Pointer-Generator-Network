Images showing designs for an artist's potential Bill Cosby sculpture were exhibited Friday night, local media reported.

The Cory Allen Contemporary Art Gallery, located in St. Petersburg, Florida, revealed the images, according to WTVT.

Rodman Edwards' statue would be called 'Fat Albert Cries for Dr. Huxtable.'

Proposal: Rodman Edwards wants to create this sculpture of Bill Cosby, called 'Fat Albert Cries for Dr. Huxtable'

In light of sexual assault allegations against Cosby, both Edwards and Cory Allen, who is representing the 15-year-old artist, have alleged that the sculpture represents the comedian's true face.

A February 5 news release from the gallery described the project as 'A teenage artist’s protest against Bill Cosby for misrepresenting his TV characters and their messages is proposed as a nude statue of Cosby’s Dr. Cliff Huxtable from The Cosby Show to 'replace' the busts of the legendary performer displayed in front of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Halls of Fame in North Hollywood and Orlando.'

The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame Plaza in Orlando is part of Walt Disney World Resort. 

Speaking to the Huffington Post earlier this month, Edwards said that 'A small one might take six weeks. A bigger one might take a few months.' 

Though Cosby has been accused by multiple women of sexually assaulting them, he has denied the claims and has not been charged with a crime

Though multiple women have come forward and publicly accused Cosby of sexual assault, he has denied the claims, the Huffington Post noted, and has not been charged with a crime.

 Daily Mail Online has reached out to Cosby's attorney and publicist for comment, as well as the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Walt Disney World.
