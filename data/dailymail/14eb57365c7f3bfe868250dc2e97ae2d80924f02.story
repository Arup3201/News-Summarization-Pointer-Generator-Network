Her striking looks and gravelly voice may not have diminished with age.

But Mariella Frostrup has claimed she lost half of her TV work the moment she turned 50.

The presenter said the 'unwelcome' development had improved her 'work-life balance' but hit out against ageism, saying it is 'the last frontier of acceptable discrimination'.

Now aged 52, she said she believes there will soon be a 'social revolution' as the so-called 'Generation X' of post-War baby boomers seek more work.

TV presenter Mariella Frostrup, 52, said ageism is 'last frontier of acceptable discrimination'

Writing in Waitrose Weekend magazine Miss Frostrup said: 'I celebrated my 52nd birthday this week. Cue gasps of astonishment and closer scrutiny of my byline picture for visible signs of ageing or rectifying surgery.

'Midlife is certainly no picnic. I've entered the realm of cliché; tuned perfectly to Radio 4, with my only regular exercise coming from mounting forensic hunts for my glasses. It's a stereotype so pervasive it's hard not to fall for it, and yet it has nothing to do with the reality of my present life as a busy, working mother of two young children.'

Since she turned 50 in 2012, Miss Frostrup has continued to host Radio 4 literary programme Open Book and fronted last year's Channel 4 show Sex Box, although her Sky Arts programme The Book Show was axed.

She said: 'I shed half my workload the moment 50 appeared on my CV, but thankfully, unwelcome though it was, it's improved my work-life balance. There are plenty of forgotten women out there not so lucky.'

Miss Frostrup said today's over 50s are an 'affluent, active, culturally ravenous bunch'.

She added: 'Today companies may scorn and shed our skills, but soon there'll be internships for mature adults returning to the job market. Mark my words, it's nothing short of a social revolution – the veneration of youth superseded by the fiscal punch of thriving mid-lifers.'

In the past, Miss Frostrup, who has two children with her human rights lawyer husband Jason McCue, has claimed ageism is 'rife' in television and once said Radio 4's flagship current affairs programme Today is 'run by a bunch of misogynists'.

In her latest intervention, she said: 'Ageism remains the last frontier of acceptable discrimination, tolerated in almost every walk of life.

'Being 50 and above, the greatest challenge comes not from your own mind and body, but from a society where entrenched attitudes have failed to keep pace with fast-extending life spans.

'A pioneer group since we were christened Generation X, we've led the advance guard on social change from feminism to racism, sexism to civil liberties, and we won't let slumbering stereotypes lie.

'We're not in with the in-crowd – we are the in-crowd.'
