They say who you are is written all over your face - except, perhaps, when it comes to your sexuality.Â 

A new study reveals most people can't tell if a man is gay just by looking at his dial because homosexuals tend to have more 'masculine' features than straights.

Debunking the myth that all gays are effeminate, the research found homosexuals tend to have 'wider and shorter faces, smaller and shorter noses, and rather massive and more rounded jaws' compared with straight guys.

Under the gaydar: A new study shows the faces of gay men may be deemed more masculine than straight men as they generally have wider jaws, shorter noses and shorter faces

Interesting: The study found it was hard for people to determine a man's sexuality by looking at his face

Huffington Post reported researchers from the Center for Theoretical Study at Charles University, Prague, and The Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic examined the faces of gays and straights in two studies.

The first analyzed whether gay
 men have noticeably different facial features than straight men.

After reviewing the portraits of 80 men - 40 gay and 40 straight white, 
Czech men - and comparing more than 
11,000 coordinates, researchers found gay men have distinct 'morphological features' which are generally more masculine.

The second study examined whether sexual orientation could be determined based 
solely on these features.

Forty female and 40 male students were asked to rate the sexual orientation of the 66 
participants - 33 gay, 33 straight - on a scale of one to seven, with one indicating a very 
straight look and seven indicating a very gay look.

Raters were also 
asked to rank masculinity and femininity from one to seven, with one 
indicting very masculine and seven indicating very feminine.

The face shapes of gay men were rated as more masculine than those of straight men.

The respondents also couldn't correctly determine sexual orientation from the pictures.

'This shows that sexual orientation 
judgment based on stereotyped gender specific traits leads to frequent 
misjudgment,' the authors wrote.

'It's necessary to point out to possible 
misunderstandings of our results.

'The fact that we have 
found some significant morphological differences between homosexual and 
heterosexual men does not mean that any of the groups is easily 
recognizable on the street (and our Study 2 actually shows that it's not
 that easy to guess anyone's sexual orientation without knowing it), or 
that anything like that should be done (like pointing on people with our
 illustrations and guessing who is who).'
