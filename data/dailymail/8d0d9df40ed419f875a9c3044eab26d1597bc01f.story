This is the dramatic moment an armed police officer kills a crazed out-of-control dog which minutes earlier had mauled a pensioner to death.

As the bloodied body of 79-year-old Clifford Clarke lies in his back garden, a police officer takes aim at the killer dog over the fence.

With the officer training his gun on the vicious animal, other police officers nervously keep an eye on a second dog in a different back garden.

As the killer dog circles the Army 
veteran's body, the armed officer eventually gets a clear shot. Eyewitnesses 
say he fired two shots, killing the beast instantly.

Horrific: The out-of-control dog was shot dead by the police officer as the 79-year-old's bloodied body lay on the ground nearby

Billy Broomfield, speaking to the 
Daily Mirror, said: 'They fired two shots and one of the dogs was dead. 
The second shrunk back and they later caught it.'

It is thought the two dogs escaped 
through a hole in a fence before one of them mauled the pensioner, who had nipped 
into his back garden to have a break from cooking dinner.

The owners of the dog – two 
women, 27 and 28 – were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter then 
released on bail pending further inquiries.

Victim: Clifford Clarke, 79, died in his back garden in Clubmoor, Liverpool, on Saturday night after he was mauled by a dog

The family of Mr Clarke 
told of their shock and heartbreak at his death at 9pm on Saturday in the Clubmoor district of Liverpool, and called for tougher 
laws for animal owners.

The dog which killed the pensioner was a bullmastiff crossed with either a Presa Canario or a bandog.

Neighbours say one of the dogs jumped at the 
retired hospital porter as he stepped out of his back door.

The dog’s jaws clamped round one of Mr Clarke’s limbs and dragged him to the ground where he was bitten a number of times.

Neighbours heard his screams and 
rushed to the three-bedroom terraced house. One of them armed himself 
with a golf club and tried to beat the animal away from the pensioner.

After killing the dog, it took three police officers to carry its body away.

Neighbour Paul McGlynn, 46, said: ‘I heard his screams – it was horrible. He seemed in a lot of pain.

‘The neighbour tried to beat them back but it was too late.’

Speaking yesterday, a grandmother 
claimed she called dog wardens to deal with the two crazed dogs just an 
hour before the mauling took place.

However, she was told they were 'too busy' to help.

Worried Selina Hagan said she called Liverpool City council after the snarling animals tried to get into her conservatory where she was looking after her 18-month-old grandchild.

But she was told they were too busy and she would have to wait four hours before they could come out.

Mrs Hagan, 59, of Clubmoor, Liverpool, told the Daily Mirror: 'I
rang the wardens over an hour before it happened at 7.29pm on Saturday,
telling them they were going mad trying to get into our conservatory.

'My
two grandchildren were here, one is just 18 months old. They weren't 
interested. We were told it would be four hours until they arrived.

'I called again an hour later to say it was too late - they'd got a man.

'If the dog wardens had listened to what we were saying, Cliff's life could have been saved.'

Mrs Hagan says she is making a formal complaint to Liverpool City council after they contradicted her version of events.

According to a council statement the 
animal warden service received a call from a resident reporting the two 
stray dogs in her garden at 7.39pm. Mrs Hagan says she contacted them 
well before that time.

A 
spokesman said: 'This was a shocking and distressing incident and our 
thoughts are with the family and friends of Clifford Clarke at this 
difficult time.

'We 
are working with Merseyside Police to assist their investigation. The 
animal warden service received a call at 7.39pm on Saturday evening from
a resident in the area reporting two stray dogs in her garden.

'Wardens were in the process of 
making their way to the property within the two hour response period 
when they received a further call from the resident at 8.42pm to say the
animals had left.

'Police then informed the wardens they were at Richard Kelly Place dealing with a serious incident involving a dog.'

Kenny Clarke, aged 70, Clifford's 
younger brother, has now called for tougher laws for dog owners after 
the death of his beloved brother.

He also released a touching image of 
him and his older sibling, posing with a dog.

He said: 'Cliff was a very easy-going man.

'He did his own thing and made a point about helping others.

'He loved his local pub - the Farmer's Arms - and had many old friends of his there who will miss him dearly.

'He did not deserve this so please 
put your support behind new laws for dog owners because you would not 
like any of your loved ones to have this happen to them.

'Our family are heartbroken.'

Joiner Gary Dignan, 36, said: ‘The 
two huge dogs had got out a few hours before and were in people’s 
gardens. One [neighbour] was too frightened to go out but called someone
to report it.’

He added that Mr Clarke walked with a
stick and described him as ‘pretty frail’, adding that he ‘wouldn’t 
have stood a chance against such big dogs’.

The attack, at 9pm on Saturday in the
Clubmoor district of Liverpool, is the second death by dogs in the past
two months.

In March, Jade Anderson, 14, was killed by two 
Staffordshire bull terriers and two bull mastiffs at a house in 
Atherton, near Wigan.

Police say they are powerless to prosecute anyone in relation to Jade’s death, because the attack happened on private property.

But when Mr Clarke was killed, he was
on his own property where the dog was not permitted, which constitutes 
an offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act.

Mr Clarke, who joined the Army in 1954 for National Service, had celebrated his 79th birthday the day before the attack.

One friend Susan Carson, 60, who 
lives across the road in the quiet cul-de-sac, said: ‘He came round for a
cup of tea at mine just before he died. He called me afterwards to say 
he had burnt his tongue but said, “I’ll be OK”.’

She added: ‘He’s lived in that house 
all his life and told us that he had been born there. It is awful for 
him to die in such a senseless way right in his own garden.’

Police said the dog attacked the pensioner in the garden of his home in Clubmoor, Liverpool, just before 8.40pm on Saturday

She said Mr Clarke had complained about the dogs and was going to report them to the police.
‘He said they could attack somebody and was worried that the  biggest 
dog had been trying to escape and had made a hole in the fence that it 
could get through,’ she said.

‘Cliff was in a terrible state when 
they brought him out, he was a bloody mess. He was only wearing his 
underwear and one slipper.’

It is not clear whether the second dog was involved in the attack. It was not killed but put on a lead.
