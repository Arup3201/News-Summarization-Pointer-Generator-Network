For months, all eyes in the sky have pointed at the comet that's zooming toward a blisteringly close encounter with the sun.

And now NASA has released a high resolution image of the streaking comet that look like a swimming tadpole.

It was captured by the H-1 camera on board NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on November 21.

Appearance: Comet ISON entered the view of NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on Nov. 21, 2013, where it can be seen with Earth, Mercury and comet 2P/Encke

The comet ISON shows up clearly, appearing to still be intact, reported NASA.

Officially labeled as Comet C/2012 S1, ISON can be seen in these images along with Earth, Mercury and Comet 2P/Encke.

The tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles – called the solar wind – that flows out from the sun.

The moment of truth comes Thursday when the sun-grazing Comet ISON, now thought to be less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) wide, will either fry and shatter, victim of the sun's incredible power, or endure and quite possibly put on one fabulous celestial show.

Should
 it survive, ISON, pronounced EYE'-sahn, would be visible with the naked
 eye through December, at least from the Northern Hemisphere.

Discernible at times in November with ordinary binoculars and 
occasionally even just the naked eye, it already has dazzled observers 
and is considered the most scrutinized comet ever by NASA.

But the best 
is, potentially, yet to come.

Detected just over a year ago, the 
comet is passing through the inner solar system for the first time. 
Still fresh, this comet is thought to bear the pristine matter of the 
beginning of our solar system.

It's
 believed to be straight from the Oort cloud on the fringes of the solar
 system, home to countless icy bodies, most notably the frozen balls of 
dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets.

For
 whatever reason, ISON was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward 
the heart of the solar system by the sun's intense gravitational pull.

The closer the comet gets to the sun, the faster it gets.

In January, it was clocked at 40,000 mph (64,000 kph). 

A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths

By last Thursday, with just a week to go, it had accelerated to 150,000 mph (240,000 kph).

On Thursday, the comet will zip within 730,000 miles (1,175,000 kilometers) of the sun, less than the actual solar diameter. In other words, another sun wouldn't fit in the missed distance.

By the time ISON slingshots around the sun, it will be moving at a mind-boggling 828,000 mph (1,332,000 kph).

Whether it survives or is torn apart, earthlings have nothing to fear.

The place to see the ‘comet of the century’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed, such as in the countryside.

It can be seen with the naked eye, but binoculars will highlight details such as its tail, streamers and bumps in the surface.

The comet is currently close enough to the sun that, tomorrow, it will close to sunrise before its head appears on the horizon.

By the end of the November, it should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky.

On 28th of November, Ison will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface before skirting around to where

The comet will venture no closer to us than about 40 million miles (64 million kilometers), less than half the distance between Earth and the sun. That closest approach to Earth will occur Dec. 26. Then it will head away in the opposite direction forever, given its anticipated trajectory once it flies by the sun.

ISON is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012. But it officially is known as C/2012 S1, a designation indicating when it was discovered.

Take heart: The 'C' means it is not expected here again.

NASA wasted no time jumping on ISON. The space agency's Deep Impact spacecraft observed ISON back in January from a distance of about 500 million miles (800 million kilometers). Since then, the observations have stacked up.

Among NASA's space telescopes taking a look: Swift, Hubble, Spitzer, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory or SOHO, Chandra, Mercury-orbiting Messenger, and the Stereo twin spacecraft.

'Every spacecraft that has a camera, we're turning on it,' said John Grunsfeld, NASA's science mission director.

The comet, top right, has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout December and January. It could be the brightest for 100 years

The newly launched Maven spacecraft en route to Mars will gaze at ISON the second week of December, once its ultraviolet instrument is up and running.

'That's well after closest approach to the sun,' the University of Colorado's Nick Schneider, who's in charge of the instrument, said in an email. So it's not known 'whether we'll see a comet, comet bits or the last wisps of comet vapor.'

Whatever happens, it's bound to be interesting. The quip from my colleagues is, `Comets are like cats: They have tails and do whatever they want.''

Besides ISON, NASA is spying on Comet Siding Spring, another Oort cloud comet discovered in January by the Australian observatory of the same name. Siding Spring will pass within tens of thousands of miles of Mars next October, so close that scientists believe the coma of the comet - its thin but expansive atmosphere - will envelop the red planet.

'It will be blanketed in water and dust and meteorites. It moves like 50 kilometers per second, blazing through the environment,' said Jim Green, director of NASA's planetary science division. That's more than 110,000 mph, (177,000 kph) so the comet will be gone from Mars 'pretty quick.'

Siding Spring-type events have happened before, Green noted. 'We're just lucky in our lifetime' to have the right spacecraft in the right place to observe the spectacle.

The same applies to ISON.

Add small sounding rockets to the list of paparazzi chasing the comet; NASA fired up one from New Mexico on Wednesday with an ultraviolet telescope that reached 172 miles (277 kilometers) high before descending by parachute.

Consider all the ground observatories peering at the comet, as well as countless amateur astronomers and astrophotographers, and ISON has become the belle of the cosmic ball.

'Comets evolve from the time they start brightening until they go all the way around the sun, and go back out,' Green said. 'By having and leveraging these assets, it really gives us that view - that unique view - that we couldn't get otherwise.'

Some sky gazers speculated early on that ISON might become the comet of the century because of its brightness, although expectations have dimmed over the past year. Scientists expect to know ISON's fate fairly quickly. At least three spacecraft will be aiming that way in real time.

If ISON survives, 'it's going to fly right over the Northern Hemisphere,' Green said with clear excitement in his voice. It should be visible with the naked eye for 30 days. 'So it's really a holiday comet. You ought to be able to see it well past Christmas,' Green said. 'But it's got to survive it, that's the only thing about that.'
