She was born into rock ’n’ roll royalty with Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and former supermodel Jerry Hall as parents, so it is no surprise that Georgia May is heading for similar success.

The genetically blessed 20-year-old famed for her iconic gap-tooth smile made her mark when 26 million people watched her walk the catwalk of the Olympic Closing Ceremony with the world's top supermodels.

And her latest campaign is equally as glamorous: modelling quintessentially British designer (and close family friend) Vivienne Westwood's new jewellery line.

Georgia May Jagger was destined for success when she was born into a family of rock stars and models

But this isn't the first time the pair have met. In fact, Vivienne designed a custom-made dress for a seven-year-old Georgia May after she threw a tantrum when she saw her mother and sister being dressed by the Dame.

But Vivienne insists that both Georgia May and sister Lizzie are down-to-earth girls, and they have their mother to thank for that.

Georgia May has modelled for Vivienne Westwood before (L) and has also been an ambassador for Rimmel London

Speaking to Grazia magazine, Vivienne said: 'She [Jerry] brought up the children really well. They're always well-behaved.'

Georgia May, who has fronted a campaign for Hudson jeans and is set to work with designer Roberto Cavalli, follows in the footsteps of her sister Lizzie, 28, who began her catwalk career aged 14, and her mother, who recently starred on Strictly Come Dancing.

She strutted her stuff before millions of viewers worldwide at the Olympic Closing Ceremony along with Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell

But she maintains that her life isn't as glamorous as it seems.

'People think I wake up every day and have my make-up done. It's really not like that,' she told Grazia.

Instead she spends many of her days with best friend and fellow model of the moment Cara Delevingne, but wants us to know there is more to the thick eyebrowed 20-year-old than meets the eye.

Georgia May and Cara have become best friends through modelling but she maintains the Cara is just a tomboy who doesn't care about looking pretty

'Cara's a massive tomboy...And not very fabulous at all! I mean, obviously she is, but I see her in a completely different way.

'I know her as a she really is, which is funny and wearing, oh, some kind of jumpsuit. And making weird faces. She doesn't care about looking pretty.

'I shouldn't be outing her,' she said.
