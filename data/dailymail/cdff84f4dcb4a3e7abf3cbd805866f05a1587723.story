Kevin Pietersen has refuted claims that he has returned two ECB gifts to mark his 100th Test.

It was said that the 33-year-old's relationship with the board had dipped so low that he opted not to keep the silver cap and framed montage handed to him.

But Pietersen took to Twitter to quash a national newspaper report of the row on Wednesday morning, posting a picture of himself with the cap.

OK: Pietersen is playing for Surrey this summer and said it was a 'relief' to be out of the England setup

‘Next time before you print LIES, check your facts!’ he fumed.

The same report also suggested that he was ignored at the ECB's Player of the Year awards at Lord's on Monday.

Meanwhile, the former England batsman has revealed that it is a 'relief' to be well out of the international dressing room after a disastrous tour Down Under over the winter.

He says he is 'grateful' for what he had with England but has 'moved on'.

'In fact, it has been a relief to be out of the dressing room because it was not a pleasant place in Australia,' Pietersen wrote in a Daily Telegraph column.

'We were losing and in my opinion the environment was poor and I was not alone in thinking that. It is a view shared by a number of the players who have spoken their minds since coming back from the tour.'
