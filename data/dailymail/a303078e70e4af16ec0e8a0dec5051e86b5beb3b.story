Police are hunting for this armed robber who they believe is behind four shop raids in the last two months

Police are hunting an armed robber wearing a 'Chucky' mask who is thought to have raided four shops in the last two months.

Shopkeepers in Scunthorpe, North Lancashire, are fearful they could be targeted next by the man, who has terrified people by wearing the horror movie mask as he brandishes a gun.

Moves have been made by the police to reassure locals that everything possible is being done to catch the man who speaks with a foreign accent and wears a distinctive Adidas tacksuit.

However, he has remained at large since October when he carried out his first robbery and has gone on to get away with two more since, though failed on another occasion to get anything after the owner fought him off.

During the first robbery, on October 16, the man got away with cash and cigarettes after asking the female cashier to hand them over.

On November 8 he made off with more cash after threatening a man with a firearm, but failed on his third attempt a week later, when he was also armed with a handgun.

On that occasion the shop owner had been locking up at around 9pm when the armed robber tried to get into the shop. However, after a brief tussle the man managed to lock himself inside and the masked man ran off.

In the final raid, which happened on Sunday at a Sainsbury's petrol station, the man escaped again after demanding money.

Two men, aged 21 and 24, have been arrested but are on bail until December pending further investigation.

Detective inspector James Fairgrieve, of Humberside Police said: 'There are people out there who know who this person is and I am now asking those people to please come forward and speak to police as a matter of urgency.

'The man in the ‘Chucky’ mask has been 
targeting a number of commercial properties in North Lincolnshire and 
police are carrying out thorough investigations to identify him, however
we need the help of the public to please provide us with as much 
information as possible.'

The man, who brandished a gun during two of the crimes, is described as speaking in a foreign accent

'The man has got away with cash from a number of the stores and thankfully nobody was injured.

He continued: 'I want to reassure the public that police are doing all they can to identify this man and we will not stop until he is arrested and brought into police custody.'

Chucky was made famous by horror film series Child's Play which featured the soul of a serial killer trapped inside the body of a children's doll.

Anyone with information in connection with any of these offences is asked to call Humberside Police as a matter of urgency on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
