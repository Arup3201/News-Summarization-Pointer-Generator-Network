For most of us, exploring the iconic sights of London involves negotiating the thronged streets craning your neck to admire some of the city's towering buildings from below.

But one intrepid photographer decided to sightsee from a better angle, far removed from the hustle and bustle of the capital.

James Charlick scaled cranes and stood precariously close to the rooftop edges of some of London's tallest buildings, climbing up to 570ft at times to take this stunning collection of city nightscape snapshots.

The 28-year-old web designer travels Europe exploring derelict buildings to see sights that many of us will never get to see.

But he decided to spend the last year perched above the London skyline in order to capture its bright lights from the best possible angle.

He said: 'Sky scrapers and iconic buildings are wonderful things and I think it's a shame that only the office workers within are able to enjoy the views they offer - especially since they frequently bustle around their work places without ever really appreciating those views.

'Combining that with the beauty of a city after dark, lit up with millions of fluorescent lights, and you have a beautiful view and an extremely peaceful atmosphere.

'At 175m above ground you don't hear much of the city noise so you become slightly detached from the frenetic energy below, you can just relax and enjoy.'

Dangerous: James, whose feet are pictured dangling in a vertigo inducing shot from the top of a central London crane, says that he never puts his life in danger when taking his pictures

Most of the pictures in James's collection of London were captured in one night from the top of a crane in the Square Mile overlooking the UK's banking heart.

Among the iconic buildings and landmarks captured in the collection of shots is the London Eye, seen lit up in a brilliant blue, Tower bridge, the Shard, St Paul's Cathedral and the Oxo Tower.

One vertigo inducing image shows photographer James's feet dangling over the edge of a crane, the city streets seemingly miles below.

He said: 'Being high up among similar tall buildings is a different feeling to being high up with everything else 20 or more floors below you, and makes for better images in my opinion.

'I believe this selection was taken over four trips around London, usually from 9pm onwards, more often after 11pm.

'Obviously this can vary depending on the time of year, since it's easier to be sneaky after dark.

'From a photographic point of view I'd love to visit around blue hour - the time after sunset when there is still colour in the sky - but this is trickier and is something I need to work out over the summer.'

But James said that although his exploits may seem dangerous, he avoids pushing himself too close to the limit.

He added 'With roof tops, and any kind of urban exploration, it's as safe or dangerous as you make it.

'Stay within your own limitations and comfort levels and the risk is minimal.

'Remember that construction workers clamber over the same structures every day - albeit wearing high visibility jackets and hard hats - so it's not as dangerous as it seems at face value.

'Of course if you decide to drape yourself over the edge of the crane counter-weight or around the wrong side of a safety barrier then the situation changes.

'I try to avoid dying, it would put a bit of a downer on my day.'
