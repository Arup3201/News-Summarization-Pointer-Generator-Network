Charged: Former PCSO Peter Bunyan was found guilty at Taunton Crown Court of abusing his position to have affairs with five women while on duty

A married PCSO has been jailed for seven years for misconduct in public office after he engaged in sexual affairs while he was supposed to be on uniformed patrol.

Peter Bunyan, 40, would track down phone numbers and addresses of women while on duty using the database with Devon and Cornwall police.

Father-of-two Bunyan had affairs with four women before and during his policing shift - sleeping with one lover up to ten times when he was on duty.

He was found guilty of neglecting his duties after it emerged he would turn his police radio down on shifts while having sex with women, as well as encouraging one mentally ill woman to send explicit pictures of herself on email to the police station.

He even had sex with one woman at a neighbourhood policing unit as he worked a late shift on a housing estate in Cornwall in 2009.

Bunyan admitted wasting police time but insisted he had not neglected his duty because he kept his radio on during the dates while working for Devon and Cornwall police.

The former car park worker denied 12 charges of misconduct in a public office but was found guilty of eight counts at Taunton Crown Court yesterday.

He was convicted of sleeping with four women and illegally accessing data relating to three lovers on the Criminal Information System.

Bunyan, who joined Devon and Cornwall police in 2003, was also found guilty of accessing the system to look up the details of a man without reason.

The jury acquitted Bunyan of having an affair with a fifth woman and falsely borrowing money from her, as well as looking up the woman and two others on the police computer.

Bunyan, of Redruth, Cornwall, remained emotionless as the verdicts were returned at Taunton Crown Court yesterday.

His honour Judge Graham Hume Jones remanded Bunyan in custody following his convictions.

The judge said: 'I will sentence this matter on Tuesday. In the meantime you will be remanded in custody. You may go down now.'

Bunyan stated his affairs never got in the way of his duty but admitted to sleeping with one lover up to 10 when he was supposed to be on patrol.

He said his beat would take him past the address of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and he repeatedly called in to continue their affair.

Bunyan told the jury: 'I tended to see her during the day time. I was on duty a lot of the time.

'I would have been in full uniform with my radio on, I was supposed to be on foot patrol. I was not taking advantage of my position, I don’t feel I was doing that at all.

'I would not say I was abusing my position but I was not doing what I should have been doing.

'I admit I was wasting police time and being negligent and not attending to my duty.'

Bunyan admitted that over the course of the affairs, between 2006 and 2011, he failed to correctly fill in police notebooks and records - leaving some days blank.

The court heard how he researched his lovers using the Criminal Information System - one up to 17 times - to find out their mobile phone numbers and pasts.

On trial: Police community support officer Peter Bunyan (pictured, left, outside court and, right, in his uniform) was accused of using highly sensitive police data to strike up affairs with vulnerable women while on duty

Bunyan, who worked as a PCSO in 
Redruth and Camborne, Cornwall, even kept a secret mobile phone hidden 
at the police station, which he used to organise liaisons with lovers 
while on duty.

During the trial, Bunyan denied being
 in uniform while sleeping with all his lovers - who were described as 
'vulnerable' and cannot be named for legal reasons.

Devon and Cornwall police suspended Bunyan when an investigation into his conduct was launched in 2011.

During the trial his defence lawyer, Michael
 Melville-Shreeve, told the court Bunyan was a ‘rat’ – but said the 
prosecution case was ‘piffle’.

He
 said: ‘The prosecution say if he’s off duty having sex with these 
women: not misconduct. If he’s on duty, if he’d stopped off to have tea 
with them or coffee with them: not misconduct.

'But if he has sex with them, it is misconduct. Why? How is that?

‘He
 [Bunyan] is a rat. He’s a disgrace as a married man. But somehow, my 
learned friend [prosecution counsel Simon Burns] wants to turn that into
 criminal misconduct.

‘If it’s not serious crime to have tea with someone for half an hour, it is not a crime to have sex consensually with them.’

Referring
 to the four-year affair between former Prime Minister Sir John Major and ex-minister Edwina 
Currie, Mr Melville-Shreeve said: ‘What about John Major and Edwina 
Currie?

‘She’s even written
 a book about it. That was a public office. I don’t know if it was on 
duty or off duty. I don’t know whether a prime minister is ever off 
duty.’

Caught: Bunyan confessed to sleeping with a woman up to ten times while on duty

He continued: 
‘I remember people were raucous about those Conservatives. But it is not
 a crime. Nobody ever called for their prosecution.’

Bunyan,
 a father of two, denied 12 counts of misconduct in a public office, 
over a five-year period in the Camborne and Redruth areas of west 
Cornwall.

Of the five women he was accused of sleeping with, he admitted having sex with four, but said it happened in his own time.

All of the women said the sex was 
consensual. Earlier, prosecutor Mr Burns had argued that Bunyan, of 
Carharrack near Camborne, ‘was not there when the public needed him’.

He told the court: ‘He abused his position as a police officer.

‘He’s targeted vulnerable individuals
 who are either people who have suffered from mental issues or 
individuals who have been at the receiving end of violence.

‘He has conducted sexual relationships, totally and utterly inappropriately, while on duty.

‘He’s ignored police radio transmissions while on duty, while turning down the radio or turning it off.

He added: ‘He has accessed the police computer 
system without legitimate policing purpose. It is clearly a conflict of 
interest with his work.’

But Mr Melville-Shreeve described the
 prosecution case as ‘piffle’, saying: ‘The police are desperate to get 
him [Bunyan] because he is one of their own.’

He added: ‘[Bunyan] is a disgrace to the uniform. He should be publicly humiliated. But he’s not a serious criminal.’
