Boris Johnson claimed yesterday that he suffers from extremely poor eyesight and can barely see anything around the house without his glasses on.

The London Mayor - said to have his eyes firmly fixed on one day leading the Tory party - said: ‘I’m now so short-sighted, I’m blind! My eyes used to be fantastic but now…’

He was asked by an interviewer what products he used to achieve his trademark ruffled mop of hair, to which he laughingly said: ‘I have no idea’.

‘There was something in the shower this morning that I used, I cannot honestly tell you what it was. It might have been acne cream. It might have been toothpaste. I honestly couldn’t see, but I put it on and it seemed to work’, he said.

Mr Johnson, 50, who is occasionally seen with spectacles on, is now the prospective MP for Uxbridge in West London. 

He also claimed to have ‘no idea’ why he had such a popular appeal among non-Conservatives.

He eventually put it down to interacting with people while cycling around London, and to his self-deprecating appearances presenting Have I Got News for You on BBC1.

‘I’ve been able to inveigle myself under people’s natural defences’, he said.

Speaking to the Observer magazine, he also happily confessed to trying cannabis as a teenager but said ‘it didn’t do much for me’.

He revealed that at university – he read Classics at Balliol College, Oxford - he had been offered a substance ‘that was alleged to be cocaine and I made an effort to try and ingest this substance, and I failed. It was a pitiably small amount anyway’, he said.

‘It later appeared that it might not have been cocaine, but rather icing sugar.’
