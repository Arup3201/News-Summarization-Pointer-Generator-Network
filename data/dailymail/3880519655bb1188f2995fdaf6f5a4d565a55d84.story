Comedian David Walliams is set to lend his distinctive voice to a remake of a 1970s cartoon, bringing Charley the cat back to life in a new series of short cartoons.

The creature and his owner featured in TV safety campaigns to help warn households of the dangers lurking in and around their homes.

Walliams has joined forces with Electrical Safety First to bring Charley's messages to today's audiences.

Revival: Comedian David Walliams is the new voice of Charley the Cat, star of the 1970s and 1980s public safety cartoon series Charley Says

Star role: Walliams has teamed up with Electrical Safety First campaign to help promote safety in the home after it emerged around 350,000 people suffer electric shocks each year

The new venture is part of a campaign to reduce the number of accidents in the home, after figures revealed around 350,000 people suffer electric shocks each year.

The new set of short films address dangerous mishaps, including overloading electrical sockets around the home with too many devices plugged into the circuit.

The first clip shows Charley the cat stepping in to save his owner from an electric shock.

Walliams' character ends up burning his paw for his troubles, but is given a fish as a treat for his quick-thinking.

The 42-year-old, who is married to model Lara Stone, is taking on the role, which once belonged to DJ Kenny Everett, before he passed away in 1995.

The DJ and star of the Kenny Everett Video Show meowed the safety messages as Charley the cat in the original Charley Says series, which aired throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

In total six films were made, funded by 
the Government, and each tackling everyday safety issues, including 
falling in the water, dangers to be aware of in the kitchen, matches and
 the importance of not talking to strangers.

A spokesman for Electrical Safety First said while the films are fun and enjoyable for people to watch, they each contain a serious message.

He said: 'Although the message is communicated in a fun way through the cartoons, it is still a serious one.

'Overloaded sockets are a major cause of electrical fires.

'Electrical Safety First recommends that, instead of relying on adaptors, you use a registered electrician to add more sockets in your home.'

High voltage appliances like dishwashers and washing machines can also cause sockets to overheat.

When a socket does overheat there is a risk of a fire igniting and spreading throughout your home.

One of the original Charley Says films featured in the video for the Prodigy's debut single Charly, released in 1991.
