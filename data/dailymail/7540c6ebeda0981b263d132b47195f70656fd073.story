Too young: Audrey Dantzlerward, 22, was found dead in her Princeton University dorm room on Monday. School officials say foul play is not suspected 

A Princeton student was found dead on Monday in her dorm room at the Ivy League institution in New Jersey. 

It's still unknown what caused the death of 22-year-old junior Audrey Dantzlerward, though school officials say foul play is not suspected.

During her time at Princeton, Dantzlerward kept busy as a member of several campus groups including the Wildcats a cappella ensemble, the  Women's Mentorship Program, Princeton Presbyterians and Edwards Collective - a community in her dorm Edwards Hall for students with an interest in humanities and the creative arts.

Dantzlerward was an English major from Springfield, Virginia, the Daily Princetonian reported.

The school has organized a remembrance for Dantzlerward scheduled for Monday night at 7:30pm in Murray Dodge Hall. 

Following news of Dantzlerward's early passing, her Wildcats a cappella group posted a message in mourning. 

'There are things that we don't want to happen but have to accept, things we don't want to know but have to learn, and people we can't live without but have to let go. You'll be forever in our hearts, Audrey. Love always,' the group wrote. 

Winter break ended for Princeton students on January 4, and final Fall term exams were scheduled to start this week on Wednesday.  

Cause of death unknown: The junior's body was found in her dorm room located in Edwards Hall (pictured above).
