A California gym member has been charged with murder for allegedly bludgeoning a man to death with a weightlifting bar for flirting with his girlfriend.

Prosecutors say Kenneth Osako, 46, struck 43-year-old David Galindo on the head with a heavy piece of gym equipment at a Bally Total Fitness in South San Francisco last Wednesday. 

Days earlier, Galindo had asked Osako's girlfriend whether she wanted a ride on his motorcycle, according to investigators.

Crime scene: The fatal altercation took place in this Bally Total Fitness gym on El Camino Real in San Francisco last Wednesday night 

San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe says police are still trying to determine whether the off-hand remark was the motive for the September 17 attack.

Galindo suffered multiple blows to the head and later died from his injuries at San Francisco General Hospital.  

Osako appeared in court Monday on a murder charge. He declined a public defender and was then taken back into custody without bail. He is due back in court September 29 for his initial arraignment. 

According to published reports, the two men were working out at the gym on El Camino Real at around 9.30pm last Wednesday when Osako picked up an 18-inch steel bar used for tricep dips and smashed Galindo in the back of the head several times.

The 46-year-old then dropped the bar and left the scene, but was apprehended the following day.

Kenneth Osako’s girlfriend, who has not been named, told police during an interview that two days before the incident, she was approached by David Galindo who invited her to take a ride on his bike.

The woman said she declined the offer, but told Osako about her exchange with Galindo Tuesday night, San Mateo County Times reported.

According to officials, the suspect’s girlfriend was not present at the gym last Wednesday and played no part in the attack. She continues to cooperate with the investigation.

Daughter speaks: Kealani Osako (left), one of Kenneth Osako's five daughters, said her father is known for his hot temper, possibly caused by an diagnosed and untreated bi-polar disorder

Osako, a father of five, worked as a plumber in San Francisco. His daughter Kealani Osako said her dad called her shortly before his arrest, telling her that a man was trying to talk to his girlfriend.

Ms Osako went on to say she believed her hot-tempered father suffers from a bi-polar disorder, but he has never been diagnosed.

‘I've seen my dad get overtaken by anger before,’ she told ABC 7 News. ‘So I can just picture him being so angry.’

Ms Osako added that her father took exercise very seriously, and whenever he went to the gym he would ‘zone out,’ making it the worst possible time for anyone to anger him.

Kealani, a student at University of California at Santa Barbara, apologized to the victim’s family, inviting them to reach out to her in the hope of giving them some ‘peace of mind.’

‘I know he's sorry and I know he didn't want this to happen. It's really hard,’ the daughter the station KTVU.

David Galindo, an avid car and motorcycle enthusiast, worked as a butcher for 16 years at a market in San Francisco, where his stunned co-workers and regular customers described him as a cheerful man who was a kid at heart.
