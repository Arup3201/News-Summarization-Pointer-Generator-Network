The seemingly-innocent SodaStream machines that allow environmentally friendly users to carbonate their own water at home has come under fire for producing ‘blood bubbles’.

The Israeli company, which has just signed on Scarlett Johansson as their first Global Brand Ambassador, runs three factories in the occupied West Bank and many say the company is taking advantage of the Palestinian residents who have few other employment options.

SodaStream has been around in one form or another for more than a century but it became a publicly traded company in 2010 and emerged on the American market over the past five or six years.

Sipping in 'blood bubbles'? Scarlett Johansson will be featured in the company's upcoming Super Bowl ad which is reigniting controversy over the locations of their factories

Now they are re-affirming their status in the cultural mainstream with an ad starring Johansson that will air during the Super Bowl, but that decision is bringing around a new round of boycotts.

The company’s tagline- ‘Set the bubbles free’- and the good, clean feeling that comes with knowing that your carbonated beverage was also good for the environment play up the advantages, and the newly-minted spokeswoman is towing the party line.

‘My favorite thing about soda stream is that I don't feel guilty when I enjoy beverages at home. I don't feel I'm being wasteful,’ Johansson said in a behind-the-scenes video showing the making of the Super Bowl commercial.

Those declarations come as double-edged swords for the company, however, as critics say that the ‘guilt-free’ bubbles come at a truly human cost.

The Forward, one of the best-known Jewish daily newspapers in the United States, slammed the company, saying that it 'does exploit the commercial benefits of (the factory's) location, essentially profiting from occupation'.

Specifically, rental rates for land in the settlement of Mishor Adumim- where the SodaStream factory is located- can run up to 69 per cent cheaper than similar land across the West Bank border in Israel.

The controversy surrounding the product isn't new, and they are finding enemies in their target audience of left-leaning environmentally conscientious foodies.

One example comes from the  Park Slope 
Co-Op in Brooklyn which used to sell the controversial filters. Now they
 have turned against them and joined a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions
 (BDS) movement and a group of members participated in a protest against
 the company in December.

Fizzy issue: Like many environmentalists, Johansson, seen here with Daniel Birnbaum, has said that she likes how users 'don't feel guilty' because SodaStream saves the use of plastic bottles

The fizz of controversy surrounding the Super Bowl ad is not the only concern for company executives, however, as their stock has taken a hit this quarter.

They estimated lower profits than usual for this past holiday season- which ended up being on point- but they also said that the first half of 2014 would be a difficult time because of lower selling prices and high production costs that makes profit margins even more slim.

Their high came in June 2012 when the company was selling for $76-per-share. The market closed today at $38.74-per-share, marking a 20.5 per cent hit since this time last year.
