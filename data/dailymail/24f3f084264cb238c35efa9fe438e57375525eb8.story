An object you might think looks ordinary, can in fact be incredibly beautiful when you take a closer look.

Photos submitted as entries to this year’s Nikon’s Small World photography contest, now in its 39th year, show just what a transformation detail can make.

The competition aims to put a spotlight on the magnificence of our natural world by showcasing stunning photography through the eye of a microscope.

The Drosera capensis, a carnivorous plant, produces strap-like leaves that are up to 3.5 cm long and 0.5 cm wide. They are covered in brightly coloured tentacles (pictured) which secrete a sticky mucilage that traps insects

This year’s entries range from dew on a spider’s web, to a close up of a soap bubble and a deep sea amphipod.

A highlight is a microscopic view of the Drosera capensis leaf which is covered in brightly coloured tentacles.

Another image, taken by Dr James Burchfield from the Garvan Institute in Sydney, highlights the explosive dynamics of sugar transport in fat cells.

A photographer from the Netherlands, Wim van Egmond, has captured a plankton organism at 250 times magnification using a technique known as differential interference contrast. This is an optical microscopy illumination technique used to enhance the contrast in unstained, transparent samples such as plankton

Darkfield microscopy, a method where the light source is blocked off causing light to scatter as it hits the specimen, was used to take an image of a Vorticella (a single-celled organism) at 20 times magnification. 

These tiny objects only show their true beauty under the microscope, when they come alive under huge magnifications.

Darkfield microscopy, a method where the light source is blocked off causing light to scatter as it hits the specimen, was used to take an image of a Vorticella (a single-celled organism) at 20 times magnification. These single-celled organisms consist of a bell-shaped head, and a stalk that is anchored to the substrate

This image of dew on spider's web was taken by Mr Massimo Brizzi at Microcosmo Italia using five times magnification

Differential Interference Contrast was used to take this image of crystallisation of tartrazine - a dye primarily used as a food colouring. The image was taken by Frederic Labaune at Education Nationale
Auxonne, France at 40 times magnification

This year's contest drew entrants from a record 72 countries, as well as from a diverse range of academic and professional disciplines.

Contestants came from such fields as chemistry, biology, materials research, botany, and biotechnology.

According to Nikon, ‘a good photomicrograph is also an image whose structure, colour, composition, and content is an object of beauty, open to several levels of comprehension and appreciation.’

The subject matter for this year's contest was unrestricted and any type of light microscopy technique was acceptable.

Techniques could include phase contrast, polarised light, fluorescence, interference contrast, dark field, confocal and mixed techniques.

The contest has been running since 1978, and an archive of previous winners can be found here.

Results of the competition will be revealed by Nikon on Wednesday 30 October.

The subject matter for this year's contest was unrestricted and any type of light microscopy technique was acceptable. This fish egg cluster was taken using stereomicroscopy at 6.6 times magnification

These tiny objects only show their true beauty under the microscope, when they come alive under huge magnifications. Mr David Forest and Alison Sweeney UC Santa Barbara, Neuroscience Research Institute took this image of a deep sea amphipod
