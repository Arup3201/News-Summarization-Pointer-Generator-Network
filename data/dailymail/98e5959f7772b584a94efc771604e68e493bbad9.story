The body of missing Hollywood movie executive Gavin Smith has been found more than two and a half years after he disappeared and was presumed murdered, police said.

The Los Angeles Country Coroner's Office confirmed a body found in a rural area of surburban Palmdale on October 26 was that of Smith, a 20th Century Fox executive who was last seen on May 1, 2012.

A year into their investigation, police said they were treating the case as a homicide.

Missing: 20 Century Fox executive Gavin Smith was last seen on May 1, 2012. After a year investigating his disappearance, police declared Smith dead and said it was a homicide case

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said hikers stumbled across the body in the area, which includes the Angeles National Forest, on October 26, KTLA5 reported.

They were later identified as the 57-year-old husband and father of three sons. A cause of death has not yet been determined, as autopsy results were not finalised, Nishida said.

Smith was last seen in May in Ventura County in Los Angeles after leaving a friend's home.

His wife, Lisa, reported him missing the following day when he failed to pick up their eldest son, Evan, to take him to school, as he had promised to do.

In March last year, police found Smith's black Mercedes Benz 420E at a Simi Valley storage facility that belonged to John Creech.

At the time he disappeared, Smith was reportedly having an affair with John Creech's wife, Chandrika Creech, whom he met in drug rehab. John Creech is currently in prison on unrelated drug charges. 

Frustrated police said that while they had a number of leads in the investigation, they did not have enough evidence to lay charges and the absence of a body was a significant hole in the case.

Two years after going missing, in May 2014, a death certificate was issued for Smith, with the death officially recorded as May 1, 2012 - the day he disappeared.

Revelations about Smith's double life, which played out in the public eye after his disappearnce, was devastating to his wife Lisa and three sons Dylan, Evan and Austin.

Shortly after he disappeared, Lisa Smith told MailOnline last year that she felt instinctively that something bad had happened to her husband.

'I think he was murdered,' she said in the interview. 'And I am terrified that whoever did it is going to come after me and our boys.'

She said she believed her husband was in the grip of a mid-life crisis that involved drugs and sex with at least three women.

Gavin earned $180,000 a year at Fox, distributing hit movies including the Star Wars and Terminator series, Avatar and Titanic. But the couple were struggling to maintain their Hollywood lifestyle and pay the mortgage on their three-bedroom home in the Los Angeles suburb of West Hills.

Lisa, an accountant who supported her husband during the early years of their marriage while he struggled as a bit-part actor, discovered he had taken money from his pension fund and squandered his year-end Fox bonus.

She also discovered he had a second mistress, named Melanie, in addition to Mrs Creech, and he was apparently setting up a home for her and her family.

It was then - two weeks before he disappeared - that Lisa Smith threw her husband out of the house.

Mrs Smith, in the MailOnline interview, said her husband appeared to be in the grip of a mid-life crisis in the time leading up to his disappearance, talking about buying new cars for his sons and dressing to impress woman.

'In hindsight, all the signs were there. He was dressing like a 20-year-old to go to drug rehab meetings and working out like mad,' she said.

She said Fox stopped paying her husband's salary two months after he disappeared and cleared out his office. Staff left several cardboard boxes of personal items, including framed family photos and golf trophies, on Lisa’s front porch.
