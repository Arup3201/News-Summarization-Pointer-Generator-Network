The California government will pay $1.95 million to an atheist and former parolee who went back to prison after refusing to participate in a religiously-tinged inpatient treatment program.

The Record Searchlight reports Barry Hazle Jr., of Redding, and his attorney announced the settlement on Tuesday in San Francisco after a legal battle that has carried on for six years.

A federal court finally ruled last year that forced participation in a religious program had violated Hazle's constitutional rights.

The 46-year-old Hazle served a year in prison on a methamphetamine charge and, after being released in 2007, was ordered to take part in a rehab program.

Compensated: The California government  will pay  atheist Barry Hazle Jr. nearly $2 million for violating his civil rights when he was sent back to prison for refusing a religious drug-treatment program while on parole

He was told Westcare’s 12-step program was the only one available to him in Shasta County.

However the program centered on submitting one’s fate to a 'higher power' and included prayer and references to God, which Hazle took offense to because of his own beliefs.

Hazle's parole agent arrested him on parole violation after he refused to participate in the program.

After serving an additional three more months in prison, Hazle sued the state corrections department. 

A judge initially ruled that Hazle’s rights had been violated, but a jury didn’t award him any damages.

Hazle then moved for a new trial on the grounds that he was entitled to compensatory damages, but it was denied by district court, only to later be reversed, the Record Searchlight reported.

A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge then ruled in August 2013 that compensatory damages are mandatory in the case of unconstitutional imprisonment.

The settlement was then handed down this week.

The payout is meant to compensate for the violation of Hazle’s First Amendment religious rights, as well as to pay for the legal costs of the long-running court battle.

'I’m thrilled to finally have this case settled,' Hazle told the Searchlight Record.

'It sends a clear message to people in a position of authority, like my parole agent, for example, that they not mandate religious programming for their parolees, and for anyone else, for that matter.'
