A British man and his fiancée are thought to have drowned after he bravely tried to save her, Italian police said last night. 

Andrew Sturgess, 34, and his girlfriend Carmen Spiridon, 25, died despite the efforts of brave off duty lifeguards who pulled them from the sea. 

Officials said both victims were not strong swimmers and they were working on the theory that Mr Sturgess had tried to save Miss Spiridon after she got into trouble in an area of treacherous shifting sands.

Tragic: The body of Andrew Sturgess on the beach in Tre Fontane near Campobello in south west Sicily

The alarm was raised after a woman on the beach at Tre Fontane near Campobello in south west Sicily, saw the motionless body of Mr Sturgess floating in the water face down.

Her screams alerted bystanders, including the off duty lifeguards on the beach, who dived into the sea and pulled Andrew onto the sand and although they attempted to resuscitate him he was already dead.

Minutes later Miss Spiridon's body was also spotted in the water but she too was also dead. 

The couple were due to fly back to their home in Stoke on Trent today after spending a week in Italy at the home of Miss Spiridon's mother, who is from Romania.  

Mr Sturgess was believed to be the manager of a hydraulic company in Stoke while his fiancée worked as a waitress and, according to local police the pair were engaged to be married. 

Today, Italian police said they were working on the theory that Carmen had got into trouble and Andrew had tried to help her but then both had got into difficulties and drowned.

Captain Fabio Manzo said: 'The alarm was raised by passers by who spotted the man's body first and then that of the woman. 

'The area of beach is public and there are no lifeguards or watch towers but screams from a woman on the beach alerted two off duty lifeguards who dived into the water. 

'They pulled the man's body out first and then tried to revive him but there was nothing that could be a done. A doctor was also on the beach and he confirmed death as well. 

'Then a few minutes later the woman's body was spotted a short distance away and she too was pulled from the water but again she was dead as well. 

'Both had water in their lungs and died from drowning. We are working on the theory that the woman got into trouble and the man went to rescue her but then both got into difficulties. 

'We were called to the scene by passers by who had pulled the bodies from the water but a doctor of the scene confirmed they were both deceased and nothing could be done. 

'The woman's mother lived locally and they were on holiday with her for the week. I have been to see her and she is obviously very upset. She told me they were engaged and due to be married.'

He added: 'The water was not rough at the time but from what we have established neither was a strong swimmer and there are awkward currents in the area. 

'They had been spotted playing around in the water just a few minutes beforehand. That area of coastline has a strange current and the sand is also very soft there.'

Capt Manzo added that initially it had been difficult identifying the couple as they had no documents, although they did recover a medicine bottle with Andrew's name on it as well as his hometown printed on a label. 

However, it was only when Carmen's mother came into the local police station to report he daughter and her fiancé missing that the connection was made. 

The deaths were the third fatality involving Britons off the coast of Sicily this summer, with a 60-year-old man losing his life last month at Siculiana Marina on the east coast of the island. 

A Foreign Office spokesperson said they were aware of the incident and offering assistance to Mr Sturgess' family.
