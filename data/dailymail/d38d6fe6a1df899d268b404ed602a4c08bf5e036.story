A woman from upstate New York is suing a Drug Enforcement Administration agent  after discovering that he set up a fake Facebook account using her identity.

Sondra Arquiett, who then went by the surname Prince, was arrested on drug charges in 2010 for her role in a suspected drug distribution network. 

Her phone was confiscated by authorities and she claims DEA Agent Timothy Sinnigen used photographs from it to set up a fake Facebook account as a way to contact other people in the investigation.

The Justice Department confirmed on Tuesday that it is reviewing the woman's complaint, which is scheduled to go to trial in federal court in Albany.

Facebook meanwhile has removed the page.

Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement that officials are also reviewing the practice of creating a fake online profile, although in court papers the department defends it.

Arquiett said in her complaint, filed last year, that she suffered ‘fear and great emotional distress’ and was endangered because the fake page gave the impression that she was cooperating with Sinnigen's ongoing investigation.

Facebook's Community Standards say, 'Claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organization, or creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook’s terms.' 

Arquiett was initially charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in 2011.
