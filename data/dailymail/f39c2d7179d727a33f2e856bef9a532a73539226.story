Focusing on other kids: The judge ordered Scott Studer to pay a donation to Newtown victims even though he is in Ohio

A former Ohio high school basketball coach who pleaded guilty to videotaping boys in a locker room shower for years has been sentenced to 15 years in prison - and must give $5,000 to the Connecticut community where a gunman killed 26 people.

Scott Studer plead guilty Wednesday morning to an eight-count indictment.

In addition to prison, Judge Frank Forchione in Canton ordered that Studer's fine be directed to Newtown, Connecticut, scene of last week's school shooting rampage. The judge didn't specify the fund that should get the 46-year-old's fine.

At least 74 boys have been identified on the secretly recorded videotapes made over the span of eight years at Jackson High School near Canton.

The judge ordered the tapes destroyed. They were found by police when they raided the coach's house and found numerous images of naked students.

Whenever the opportunity arose, Studer had been placing hidden cameras in the locker room, focused on the shower area. Officers believe that the coach had been doing this for the last seven years. It is unclear whether Mr Studer is married or has children.

Studer was arraigned on six felony counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material.

Police Chief David Zink and School District Superintendent Chris DiLoreto held a tense press conference with over 50 angry parents.

As reported by Cantonrep.com, Zink told the room that he could not give ‘any indication of how many people are in these images’. The chief added that: 'These images, to my knowledge, were not shared with others.’

But disgusted parents now face an deeply uncomfortable wait to see if their children are identified on Studer’s videos.

Many parents are angry with how the 
situation has been handled by authorities. Mother Vicky Smith, whose son
 plays on the freshman basketball team, told Newsnet5 she was upset that the school hadn't contacted parents immediately or provided counseling.

'For them, the school, not to have psychologists in there today working with the boys through this, not having contacted the parents of the children, having to hear about it from outside sources, I'm very concerned,' Smith said.

Meanwhile, students have taken to social media discuss their anger and betrayal by a long-standing figure of trust. Many boys have recalled how Studer used to make students take a shower, even if they didn’t want to.

Other potential victims spoke of odd practices at showertime, such as Studer suggesting snowball fights or playing with a volleyball.

This morning, Studer was represented in court by attorney James Haupt . He told Cantonrep.com: ‘At this time we are maintaining his innocence in this particular case. It is too early on to say much.’
