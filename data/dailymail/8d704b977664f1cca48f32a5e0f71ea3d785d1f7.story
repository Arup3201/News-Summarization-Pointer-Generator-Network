A pregnant woman and her female friend drowned on Tuesday night when they accidentally drove down a boat ramp into the ocean just minutes after they got lost hiking but were rescued by an off-duty firefighter.

Mother-of-one Melissa Moyer, 38, a teacher from Sunbury, Pennsylvania, was visiting long-time friend Amy Stiner, 37, who was five months pregnant, in Machias, Maine when the two women went hiking at Roque Bluff State Park but got lost in the midst of a heavy downpour.

Moyer called for help as it was getting dark and the friends were no doubt relieved when nearby landowner and member of Sunrise Search & Rescue, Wayne Hansom, found them and dropped them at Stiner's 2001 blue Dodge minivan.

But as they left the parking area at 
around 9 p.m., Stiner took a right turn instead of the left turn that 
would have taken them back to town, and accidentally drove through the 
heavy fog down a boat ramp and into the ocean. The pair and their dog 
drowned in the submerged vehicle.

'The end of the road becomes the boat landing and they just weren't familiar with it,' Washington County Sheriff Donnie Smith said. 'It was foggy and rainy and they literally drove off the boat landing right into the water.'

He added: 'It's just so easy to do. When I got the call last night, I knew what had happened.'

Schoppee Point Road ends in the 
remote boat landing. There are no homes or businesses in the area and 
none of the fishing boats were occupied because of the late hour and 
wild weather, Smith told the Kennebec Journal.

Stiner, an organic farmer, was able to call 911 on a 
cellphone as the car was becoming submerged. They reached Main State 
Police barracks in Orono.

'They called on the phone that they 
were in the water and the car was filling up. Then the phone went dead,'
Smith said. 'An hour later, the deputies found the car.'

Sheriff's deputies used the GPS on the cellphone used to locate the van, which by 10 p.m. was about 175 feet from shore.

Smith said the women were found in the 
back seat, probably because the front of the vehicle would have sunk 
first, providing them a few more gasps of air.

The doors were closed 
and the windows were up.

Local fire departments, the Machias Police Department, Maine Marine Patrol and U.S. Coast Guard also helped search for the women after they called 911 from the vehicle.

Stiner was also from Pennsylvania and had lived in Machias, a town of 300 people in eastern Maine, for around two years.

Smith called the deaths a tragic accident made worse because Stiner was five months pregnant.

'This
lady lived on Kennebec Road. She wasn't far from home,' Smith said of 
Stiner. 'I suspect they were cold and wet and just made a mistake.'

Stiner's husband, Gregg, told media outside the couple's white farmhouse on Wednesday that he and Stiner were organic farmers.

He declined to talk any further about his wife or the harrowing accident.

Friends
and work colleagues of the couple, Aaron Bell and Carly DelSignore, 
described how Stiner and her husband moved to Maine to get into organic 
farming and start a family, which is what they were doing when she 
tragically died.

'Amy was fully dedicated to the local foods 
movement,' Bell told the Bangor Daily News. 'They've been working with 
us for two years.'

The Stiners, Bell said, were raising 34 young 
dairy heifers and about 1,000 chickens on leased land off Kennebec Road,
and sold their produce at local farmers markets each week.

'They were excited to get experience any way they could,' Bell said. 'This is just a tragedy. Everyone's in shock right now.'

Sheriff Smith said Moyer's family, including Moyer's 12-year-old son, Alex, were headed to Maine on Wednesday. Since her death, the boy has 
changed his Facebook profile and cover photograph to pictures of his 
mother, whom he appeared close to.

Moyer
worked for the Shikellamy School District in Pennsylvania as a personal
care aid and was stationed at the Milton Area High School, in Milton, Pennsylvania.

Superintendent
Pat Kelley told The Daily Item newspaper: 'On behalf of the Shikellamy 
School District I would like to extend my condolences to the family and 
friends of Melissa.

'It
is a sad and tragic situation. Melissa was a dedicated employee, and I 
have had the pleasure of meeting her and she was a wonderful person.'

Justin Anthony, a local fisherman, told the Bangor Daily News that he was at home on Tuesday night when several emergency vehicles drove past his house with their sirens blaring.

He said he drove a couple of miles down to the ramp to see what was going on and saw that police and divers trying to get to the submerged vehicle.

Anthony said the tide was about halfway in when the incident occurred. He said he's never heard of any vehicles accidentally driving into the water before, particularly with some a devastating outcome.

'I've been living here 35 years,' Anthony said. 'It's the first time.'
