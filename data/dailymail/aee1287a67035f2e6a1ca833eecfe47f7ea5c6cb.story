Tony Blair was able to parade a glittering line-up of star supporters from the worlds of film, music and television when he first won power – and even his successor, Gordon Brown, managed to gain the backing of Doctor Who and a supermodel.

But with fewer than three months to go until polling day, Ed Miliband – who recently advertised for a new ‘celebrity endorsement’ adviser – appears to be struggling to win the backing of the celebrities his party could once count upon.

The news comes after the previously ‘staunchly Labour’ TV presenters Ant and Dec said they could not picture him as Prime Minister.

As the Labour leader prepares to woo the ‘creative industries’ by making a major speech on the arts tomorrow, The Mail on Sunday can reveal the results of its own investigation into Ed’s celebrity problem.

We contacted ten public figures who enthused about Labour at the last Election. 

Of those, only one – the transvestite comedian and veteran Labour activist Eddie Izzard – said he would be backing Ed.

Despite persistent approaches from this newspaper, previously pro-Labour stars were conspicuously silent. 

Among them was Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, who gave £1 million to Labour in 2008 when Mr Brown was leader.

Actor Ross Kemp (left) did not offer a quote when asked for his endorsement of Mr Miliband. A spokesman for Mick Hucknall said they had ‘no idea’ whether the Simply Red singer would be voting for Mr Miliband

However, when asked about her current voting plans, her spokesman said: ‘J. K. Rowling is not planning to publicly announce who she will be supporting.’

It was a similar story with pop star Lily Allen, who said in 2010: ‘I can’t not vote Labour.’ However, when contacted last week, Ms Allen’s spokesman said: ‘No comment.’

In 2010, ex-GMTV star Fiona Phillips pledged: ‘I’m more Labour than Labour.’ This time, her spokesman said: ‘Fiona doesn’t align herself to any particular political party.’

At the last Election, Doctor Who star David Tennant said: ‘I would rather have Gordon Brown than David Cameron.’ 

But when asked if the same applied to Ed Miliband, Mr Tennant’s spokesman said: ‘We can’t reach David for a comment.’ 

Five years ago, ex-EastEnders actor Ross Kemp backed Labour. When Mr Kemp was asked last week for his endorsement of Mr Miliband, a spokesman said: ‘We may have a quote for you later.’ 

Ten minutes later, she said: ‘Sorry – no quote.’

Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson (left) failed to respond to requests for comment but transvestite comedian and veteran Labour activist Eddie Izzard (right) – said he would be backing Ed

At the last Election, Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall backed Mr Brown, but this time a spokesman said they had ‘no idea’ whether Mr Hucknall would be voting for Mr Miliband. 

A further three Labour backers in 2010 – former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, supermodel Naomi Campbell and business guru Duncan Bannatyne – failed to respond to requests for comment.

Only Mr Izzard vowed to provide public support for Mr Miliband.

Labour HQ appears to be concerned. The party has advertised for a £33,000-a-year endorsement officer ‘to forge new relationships with celebrities’. 

Yesterday, Labour said its well-known supporters included the artist Grayson Perry, the actor David Morrissey and the comic Ben Elton. 

A spokesman added: ‘We have a great spread of celebrity and high-profile figures supporting Labour.’

The Conservative Party has named footballers Sol Campbell and Frank Lampard, cricketer Darren Gough, artist Tracey Emin and Sir Michael Caine among its supporters.

 

P.S. Even the man who's paid to impersonate the Labour leader says he has a 'fake image problem' 

If there’s one thing that everyone knows, it’s that Ed Miliband has an image problem, writes impressionist and comedian MATT FORDE. 

Even Labour supporters like me know it. It dogged him before his leadership and has only grown worse over the last five years.

Lots of PR types bang on about how he needs to change his image to connect with the public, that his appearance and voice are a major barrier to people warming to him. 

He won’t change his image and neither should he, at least not in the way that some people think he should.

I hope he doesn’t, because as an impressionist, he’s an absolute gift to me and if he becomes Prime Minister he’ll keep me in work for at least another five years.

Poor political judgment is more damaging than a superficially bad image. Labour supporters who believe his problems are only skin deep need to ask themselves a simple question. 

If Ed radically overhauled his image, would it deliver a Labour majority? The answer is, of course, no.

'Absolute gift': Matt Forde as Ed Miliband

I’m not saying that Ed doesn’t have to change the way he handles himself, but there’s a difference between an image problem and not being yourself.

Ed behaves in that way that so many modern politicians do. The faux-concern, shown by a slightly ruffled brow. 

The synthetic body language, complete with the thumb-point. It’s completely fake. 

A lot of it was borrowed from Bill Clinton and most of Ed Miliband’s physical routine is a poor imitation of Tony Blair. 

Ed should chill out a bit and be more of himself.

Being nerdy in itself isn’t the problem that people think it is. There’s no merit in trying to label Ed Miliband as an underdog. 

This is politics, it’s not the 3rd round of the FA Cup. We want people who can lead and succeed.

This is where Ed Miliband has a problem. He suffers from a lack of authority, caused by the lack of a coherent policy direction and bad judgment.

Take his recent attacks on business. When Ed launched his attack on tax dodgers he should have had a host of business leaders sounded out beforehand and ready to do media rounds as part of a co-ordinated campaign to prove that Labour has successful friends who think he should be Prime Minister.

This didn’t happen for one of two reasons. Either it wasn’t planned properly – which shows bad judgment – or it wasn’t possible because not enough successful business people were willing to support him.

In terms of election manifesto, it doesn’t feel like Labour has anything really big to say. The cost of living crisis is genuine but it’s going to take more than freezing energy bills at an already high rate to reverse it.

Ed Miliband should be talking about Britain beyond the deficit, about our hopes and dreams. Labour supporters like me want to hear about the jobs of the future and not just in an empty slogan. 

I want to know what they are and how Ed would get them here.

The Coalition hasn’t made most people excited about the future, but Labour has completely failed to capitalise on this.

I long to hear Ed Miliband talk the language of ambition – even if only in his nerdy voice – but he doesn’t. 

Like many other people, I long to feel inspired about the future of Britain and want to feel like the governance of the country is in safe hands.

David Cameron or Nick Clegg don’t fit the bill. But the brutal truth is, I doubt Ed Miliband does either.
