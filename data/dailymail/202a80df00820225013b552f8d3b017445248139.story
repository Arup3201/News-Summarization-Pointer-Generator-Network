Kendall Jenner flaunts her bikini body and cozies up to Justin Bieber in a new Vogue spread, which also features Gigi Hadid, Ansel Elgort, Dylan Penn and her younger brother Hopper.

The six stars were shot by legendary photographer Mario Testino as they soaked up the California sun and modeled designer duds for the magazine's April issue. Vogue dubbed the stylish group 'Hollywood's New Brat Pack'.

Although one sultry image shows Kendall and Justin pressing their chests against each other as they stare off into the distance, the 21-year-old singer told the magazine that he is 'actually an introvert'.

She's quickly becoming one of the most sought after models in fashion, so it's no surprise that Kendall Jenner made yet another appearance in Vogue magazine's April issue along with other style mavens, Gigi Hadid and Justin Beiber.

The reality star sported a look from Givenchy's Spring collection that included a lace dress and leather leggings topped with a sleeveless striped coat made of goatskin. The showpiece included macramé lace and eyelet detailing.

In theory, the mixing of textures and patterns sounded like a clash and burn. But somehow Ricardo Tisci, the mastermind behind it all made it work.

While you can't get your hands on this one-of-a kind masterpiece, we've found some noteworthy alternatives including a similar option from the French fashion house that is a major investment. Now you can have your very own statement coat from Ming Wang, Balmain, or Kenneth Cole starting at just over $60.

'But as far as shooting fashion goes, or being on stage - me having to be on - I don't get nervous', he explained. 

Another picture features Justin in jeans and an open denim button-down shirt as he lounges poolside with his arm casually draped around a bikini-clad Kendall.

This is the 19-year-old realty TV star's fifth time modeling for the iconic glossy. For the magazine's February issue, Kendall was photographed by Patrick Demarchelier as she modeled statement pants.

But this time around, Kendall had more company. In addition to posing next to Justin, she was also snapped walking beside her friend and fellow model Gigi, as well as 21-year-old Ansel.

The two, who famously affirmed their friendship by attaching a 'love-lock' on a Paris bridge, can be see strutting down the street in one image from the spread.

Gigi modeled a white Alexander McQueen dress that was topped with a Burberry Prorsum biker jacker with shearling trim, while Kendall wore a Givenchy macrame sleeveless coat and a striped lace dress.

Kendall revealed that she used to be better friends with 19-year-old's younger sister Bella, but she and Gigi 'clicked right away' when they both ended up modeling in New York City.  

Kendall announced the upcoming spread in Vogue yesterday by sharing a snapshot of herself alongside Gigi and Mario, captioning the picture: 'Dream team.'

When Kendall took to Instagram today to post a photo of herself and Bieber from the shoot, she nearly broke the internet.

Within 30-minutes, the post had nearly 325,000 likes and more than 10,000 comments. 

But Kendall is well aware of her cult-like following.

'I like to think that I can just grab a pair of sunglasses and go anywhere - but subconsciously I'm aware when I'm at the gym that I need to save some energy so I can do a 40-yard dash, in sub-4.5 seconds, straight to the front seat of my car when I leave,' she told the magazine. 

Kendall, Justin, Ansel, and Gigi along with Cody Simpson, all posed for Mario's popular Instagram 'Towel Series' while they were on set for the Vogue photoshoot.

Kendall can be seen with a towel piled on top of her head, while Justin flaunts his ripped abs with a towel hanging off of his waist.

Ansel donned a fluffy robe and real-life couple Gigi and Cody posed topless, sharing only one towel between the two of them.
