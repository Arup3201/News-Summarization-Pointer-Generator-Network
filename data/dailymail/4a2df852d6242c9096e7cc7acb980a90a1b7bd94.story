Not stable: Doctors have ruled Morgan Geyser, 12 (pictured) incompetent to stand trial in the attempted murder case of a classmate last May

Doctors have found one of two pre-teen girls accused of stabbing a classmate to please a fictional online horror character mentally incompetent to stand trial, attorneys said Wednesday.

In reports not made public, a doctor for the state of Wisconsin and another hired by the defense agree that 12-year-old Morgan Geyser is not mentally competent.

The results were discussed during a brief court hearing Wednesday, while Geyser sat emotionless, braiding her hair.

Geyser and the other stabbing suspect Anissa Weier, also 12, entered the court room separately on Wednesday, both cuffed and wearing blue scrubs.

Weier was also composed, hiding her face behind her dark hair, the Journal Sentinel reported.

During the proceedings the court also granted the defense's request to test Geyser for mental disease or defect, which could result in a potential insanity plea.

A hearing on her mental competency will be held on August 1.Â 

Authorities say Geyser and Weier plotted for months to kill their unidentified friend to curry favor with Slender Man, a character in horror stories they read online.

They told investigators they believed Slender Man had a mansion in a Wisconsin forest and they planned to go live with him after the slaying.

For 'Slenderman': Geyser and friend Anissa Weier are accused of trying to stab to death a 12-year-old classmate in order to please the fictional 'Slender Man'. The victim being wheeled away by paramedics following the incident in May

The two girls attacked the 12-year-old
 victim in a wooded Waukesha park on May 31 after a sleepover the night 
before, a criminal complaint says.

Doctors
 later told police the victim had been stabbed 19 times and the knife 
missed a major artery near her heart by a millimeter. The child has 
since been released from a hospital and is recovering at home.

The
 victim recently thanked supporters with a message online. In a photo 
with her face out of sight, she holds up a heart-shaped car that reads 
'thank you' surrounded by messages from supporters all around the world.

Wisconsin law requires attempted 
homicide cases to start in adult court if a suspect is at least 10, but 
the girls' attorneys have said they hope to see the charges moved to 
juvenile court, where more services might be available.

Court
 proceedings typically halt once a defendant is found incompetent to 
allow time for treatment. However, Cotton had filed a motion Monday 
asking the judge to allow pretrial proceedings in his client's case to 
continue even if she is found incompetent.

One
 thing that could be addressed while she is in a hospital is a 
yet-to-be-filed request to move her case to juvenile court, Cotton said.

In court on Wednesday, parents for both of the girls appeared for support.

Geyser's dad spent most of the hearing in tears, his head hunched over in his hands while Weier's father remained stoic.
