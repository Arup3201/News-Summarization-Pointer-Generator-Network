U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Wednesday underwent a heart procedure at
a Washington hospital after reporting discomfort following
routine exercise, a court statement said.

Ginsburg, 81, was resting comfortably after having a stent
placed in her right coronary artery and is expected to be
discharged from MedStar Washington Hospital Center within 48
hours, the statement said.

previously survived serious bouts with cancer in 1999 and 2009.

1993, has resisted calls from liberal activists that she should
retire from the bench before President Barack Obama leaves
office in early 2017.
