Jennifer Pan was found guilty Saturday of hatching a fake home invasion in order to try and murder her parents in November 2010

An Ontario woman was found guilty Saturday of hatching a plan to kill her parents and then faking a home invasion that left her mother dead and her father seriously wounded.

Jennifer Pan, 28, will spend the next 25 years in prison at minimum after masterminding her mother Bich Ha Pan's murder in November 2010.

Found guilty alongside Pan were her boyfriend Daniel Wong and the two thugs she hired to help carry out her diabolical plot--Lenford Crawford and David Mylvaganam.

According to the prosecution, Pan was obsessed with Wong and snapped when her parents forbade her from seeing him.

The Toronto Sun reports that Pan spent years lying about her relationship with Wong and even lied to her parents about attending a university--to which her father paid tuition--in order to be with him.

She was actually living with Wong in a nearby town and when her parents caught wind of the deciet, they ordered her home.

That, prosecutors say, is when Pan started to hatch her murder plot.

She paid her drug dealer boyfriend's drug contact friends $10,000 to help her carry out the deed, reports the National Post.

On November 8, 2010, Pan, Wong, Crawford and Mylvaganam--and, allegedly, a third thug named Eric Carty, who will stand trial at a later date--entered Pan's parent's home.

Her mother would later be found dead of a point-blank gun shot wound. Her father was shot in the face and placed in a medically induced coma for days, reports the Toronto Star.

Hours earlier, Pan had sat at her parents' kitchen table and laughed with them as they ate dinner. 

On Saturday, Pan and three others stood in court where they were all deemed guilty of first degree murder. 

Mandatory sentencing requires they serve at least 25 years in prison before the possibility of parole.

All will receive life sentences at a formal hearing scheduled for January 23.
