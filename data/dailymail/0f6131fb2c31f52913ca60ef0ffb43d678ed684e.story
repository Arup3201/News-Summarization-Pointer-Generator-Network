Sony Pictures seems to be taking North Korea's objections to the company's upcoming Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy seriously enough to begin altering the film.

The film, titled The Interview, follows a pair of TV journalists recruited by the CIA in a plot to assassinate North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un.

The Hollywood Reporter reports the studio is altering thousands of buttons worn by characters in the film because of they depict real buttons worn by the North Korean military meant to honor both Kim Jong Un and his late father Kim Jong Il.

The nation would consider showing military decorations blasphemous.

The studio is also considering cutting a scene in which Kim Jong Un's face is melted off in slow motion.

However a source in touch with The Hollywood Reporter says the face-melting may be cut only because the filmmakers are still trying to decide whether they think it's funny, and not because of pressure from the rogue nation.

The studio insists the alterations have nothing to do with concern over political fallout, they do come not long after statements out of Pyongyang showing anger over the film.

The film's concept 'shows the desperation of the 
U.S. government and American society,' for one.

A source claims the hardware problem is made complicated by 'clearance issues' as the badges involve a living person.

An unofficial North Korean spokesperson has also asked President Barack Obama to prevent the film's release. 

Indiewire notes that political pressures have resulted in a number of changes to Hollywood films in recent years.

For fear of alienating foreign audiences, the filmmakers behind the recent Red Dawn remake changed their invading antagonists from Chinese to North Korean.

A representative has already said that Kim Jong Un will likely watch interview, to which Seth Rogen tweeted: 'I hope he likes it!'

The film is set for Christmas Day release.
