Bo Pelini, the longtime coach of college football team the Nebraska Cornhuskers, flared up about the widespread use of marijuana across the US on Friday.

The 46-year-old, who as head coach earns a yearly salary of $2.875 million, said the drug is no longer contained to high schools and colleges but is an issue affecting everyone.

'It is out of control,' he said at the Big Red Breakfast, according to Omaha.com.

'Let’s face it, it’s not OK.'

Outspoken: Nebraska Cornhuskers head coach Bo Pelini said in an interview Friday that the US has a serious issue with marijuana, and that today's youths are receiving 'bad information' about its dangers.

Pelini said he believes his generation were more aware about the dangers marijuana.

'I think everybody that’s our age, my age, hopefully understands that it’s not OK,' he said.

'It’s not good. It’s not good for you.

'And these kids do it on a daily basis and a yearly basis ... and it’s a real problem out there.'

Pelini said today's youth are not educated enough about the associated dangers.

'I think it’s something in society we need to get fixed ... but unfortunately they get bad information.'

Pelini's brother, Carl, resigned from his position as Florida Atlantic head coach last October amid allegations of both marijuana and cocaine use, Sports Illustrated reported.

However Pelini defended his sibling, saying that was not the reason for his departure.

This week Pelini was also sure to stand by his own team, where he claims there is no issue with marijuana.

Marijuana possession has been decriminalized in Nebraska.

'Fortunately for us it is not (an issue) in our program,' he said.

'But I can tell you around college football and college athletics ... serious in college.

'I guarantee you walk into dorms nowadays and it is a horrible problem.'

Widespread: Data released in July by the NCAA showed that 24 percent of college football players reported using marijuana

The NCAA reduced the penalty for an athlete testing positive for marijuana from one year to half a year in April.

In July it was revealed that 24 percent of college football players reported using marijuana, according to NCAA data.

Then this summer, Nick Marshall, quarterback for the Auburn Tigers, was cited for marijuana possession.

He has since been removed from the teams season opener against Arkansas, Sports Illustrated reported.
