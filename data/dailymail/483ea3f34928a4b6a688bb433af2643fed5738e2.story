Hollywood power-brokers vowed a ‘dialogue’ with the Obama administration concerning depictions of gun violence in American cinema following a high-profile White House meeting with Vice President Joe Biden.

Entertainment industry leaders convened for two-and-a-half hours Thursday with Biden and other Obama administration officials to hash out potential solutions to the recent spate of gun violence plaguing America.

Finding solutions: Joe Biden speaks today at a meeting with video game industry executives, in Washington, DC.

And although no earth-shattering accords were apparently reached, the two sides agreed to work more closely on the issue. 

‘The entertainment community appreciates being included in the dialogue around the administration’s efforts to confront the complex challenge of gun violence in America,’ read a joint-statement issued after the meeting by, among other groups, the Directors Guild of America.

‘This industry has a long-standing commitment to provide parents the tools necessary to make the right viewing decisions for their families.'

Meanwhile, Biden followed his summitt with Hollywood moguls with a similar gathering Friday with video game manufacturers.

All the president's men: The president appointed Biden to head a task force to look into ways to stem gun violence in America

Fact-finding: Biden conducted a run of meetings this week with movie and video game industry reps, as well as the NRA

Beating the bushes: Biden also met with advocates for sportsmen and wildlife interest groups in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C., earlier in the week

Important mission: Biden talks to the press after a meeting with Cabinet members and sportsmen's, wildlife and gun interest groups at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, DC. this week

Representatives from the companies that make 'first-person shooter' games such as 'Call of Duty,' 'Medal of Honor' and 'Grand Theft Auto' attended the meeting, in which the veep broached the possibility of utilizing existing technology to ensure that no party other than a weapon's purchaser is able to actually fire it.

President Obama has pushed gun controls to the top of his domestic agenda following last month’s school shooting.

His administration is assembling proposals that would include a ban on sales of assault weapons, limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines, a crackdown on gun fairs and universal background checks for gun buyers.

Few analysts expected Hollywood to make any sweeping attempts to curb violence in films.

Change in the air: Obama formed the Biden-led task force following last month's shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut

Due date: Biden's task force reportedly will have recommendations for Obama on the issue as early as Tuesday

Hard stance: NRA president David Keene (pictured) said this week following a meeting with the Biden-led task force that he didn't see an assault weapon ban passing Congress

But Mr. Biden, who is leading a White House task force putting together the new legislation, won a pledge from film and television industry groups that they would work closer with Washington.

America’s top gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, also met with the Vice President and told him they will attempt to block any new gun laws.

Instead of making it more difficult for Americans to own guns, the group wants to post an armed security officer in every school in the country.

‘I do not think that there's going to be a ban on so-called assault weapons passed by the Congress,’ NRA president David Keene said after the meeting.

The gun debate dominated the news in the US as details emerged about another school shooting that happened in Taft, California on Thursday morning.

A 16-year-old student armed with a shotgun shot a teenager he claimed was bullying him and fired bullets at his terrified classmates.

The confrontation could have been even worse but for a heroic teacher, Ryan Heber, who calmly told the teen to put the weapon down and give himself up.

His brave move was enough of a distraction to give 28 students time to escape their classroom at Taft Union High School near Bakersfield, police said yesterday.

The victim, who was hit in the shoulder, was in critical but stable condition yesterday and was expected to survive.
