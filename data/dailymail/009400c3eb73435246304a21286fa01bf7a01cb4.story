Earlier this week she was partying 
with Chris Brown and JLS's Aston Merrygold in Hollywood but today 
Topshop heiress Chloe Green was back to work launching her latest shoe 
collection in London.

The
22-year-old's first two collections, designed by Chloe and her team and
stocked in Selfridges, Topshop (of course) and on 
Chloe's website, defied critics to become a commercial success.

Her
roster of celebrity fans now includes Kim Kardashian, Demi Lovato and 
Nicole Ritchie and she is hoping her third shoe collection will follow 
suit.

Chloe said she has re-worked old favourites as well as introducing new styles with her latest designs

The Topshop heiress said she's excited about her latest range going on sale

Speaking following the launch in 
Selfridges this morning, Chloe told MailOnline: 'I have just come home 
from my holidays so it was great to head straight to Selfridges.

'I
am very excited to see the third collection in stores. I am super lucky
they wanted to stock it after the second collection was such a hit.

'I get brilliant feedback from 
customers who like what I'm doing and now my biggest challenge is to 
keep bringing them back each season by reworking their favourites as 
well as giving them something new.

The trademark green soles are still in the third collection and edgy spike detailling

'I love what I do and I didn't want to give it up. My ideas have come together and I have really learnt what my customers want.'

Taking
inspiration from the likes of super cool Cara Delevingne and Rita Ora, 
Chloe has introduced a trainer into her latest collection, which she has
been working on for six months.

'I think Rita would look great in a pair of my trainers,' she said.

As a petite girl growing up in the world of fashion very high heels were an early necessity for Philip Green's only daughter.

But she has now decided to expand her range by introducing flat sandals as well as lower heels.

'I
was inspired by being away in hot places so I wanted to design shoes 
for the beach as well as the club. You can pick two or three pairs from 
my range which can take you from day to night,' she said.

The first two collections that Chloe models here defied critics to become a commercial success

The new collection includes stacked platforms and mega wedges, all featuring Chloe's signature green sole

She is flattered by the great response she has received and can now count some of the world's most famous faces as fans.

'Nicole Scherzinger has 
been great. She saw my collection and loved it and wanted to wear my 
shoes. Nicole Richie has been really supportive so has Demi Lovato.'

Another famous fan is Kim Kardashian, who is known for her love of sky-scraper high heels.

'Kim Kardashian already has a pair but now she is pregnant she probably won't be wearing them but maybe after.

Chloe said: 'My biggest challenge is to keep bringing my customers back each season by reworking their favourites as well as giving them something new'

But Chloe added: 'Now I am focusing on a very different kind of customer.'

Like many other designers, she has her sights set on dressing a certain Duchess.

'Who
wouldn't want to dress the Duchess of Cambridge? It would be nice for 
an English brand to dress someone so British. Plus they are also a more 
reasonable height,' she said.

While
she is honoured that big names don her designs, she is also just 
grateful that everyday shoppers have embraced her green-soled shoes.

'Anyone wearing a green sole is great. It is so great to see my shoes on people,' she said.

While she is currently focusing on unveiling and pushing her third shoe collection, ambitious Chloe also has her sights set on other projects.

She revealed: 'I am in talks on a potential future developments with them Swarovski so that's exciting. Plus we are opening a store in Hong Kong and I after seeing so many celebrities wearing amazing Topshop couture gowns, I would love to design a range.'
