Omar Saeed Sheikh (pictured in 2002), who was convicted of the murder of reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002, has attempted to commit suicide in prison, police have said

A British man serving life imprisonment in Pakistan for the killing of American reporter Daniel Pearl has tried to commit suicide, police have said.

Omar Saeed Sheikh was convicted in 2002 of the murder of Pearl, who was the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was kidnapped and beheaded in Pakistan.

The 38-year-old reporter had been investigating militant groups when he was abducted in Karachi in January , 2002.

On February 21, 2002, a shocking video of his killing was delivered to U.S. officials in Pakistan.

His remains were found in a shallow grave on Karachi's outskirts three months later.

British-Pakistani Sheikh, who attended Forest School in Snaresbrook, east London, and three others were arrested and convicted in June 2002.

Sheikh has now tried to hang himself in prison, Senior police official Akram Naeem has told the AFP news agency.

Mr Naeem said he was rescued after he was spotted by officials.

He said: 'His condition is stable now and a case has been filed against him in the local police station.'

In January 2011, a report by the Pearl Project at Georgetown University suggested the wrong men had been convicted of the murder.

Daniel Pearl was abducted from Karachi while researching a story on militant groups - his body was found three months later

The investigation claimed the alleged mastermind behind 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, was responsible for the murder.

Days before he was abducted, Pearl had learned that his wife Mariane was expecting a baby boy.

Mariane remained in Pakistan and campaigned for her husband's release throughout his capture.

Daniel Pearl's death was confirmed on February 21, 2002. There were outpourings of grief from political and religious leaders, along with ordinary people around the world, who had campaigned for his release.

Three months later, Mariane gave birth to the couple's son Adam.

Marianne Pearl wrote a memoir entitled A Mighty Heart about her late husband's life which was adapted into a film starring Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl and Dan Futterman as the journalist.
