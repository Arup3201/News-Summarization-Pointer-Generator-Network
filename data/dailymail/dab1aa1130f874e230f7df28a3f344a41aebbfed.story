Lewis Hamilton believes his spin on lap 28 of the Brazilian Grand Prix cost him victory.

Hamilton, who was bidding to leapfrog Nico Rosberg during the second round of pit-stops, posted the fastest lap of the race, but then lost control of his Mercedes under braking at Turn 4 on the following lap – the incident cost him six seconds.

While the Briton managed to reel Rosberg back in, he was unable to pass his team-mate meaning the gap between the championship rivals now stands at 17 points ahead of the title decider in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight’s time.

Hamilton lost roughly six seconds when he spun in his Mercedes and ran off the circuit on lap 28 

1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points 

2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points 

*If Lewis Hamilton finishes second at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, he will win the title even if Nico Rosberg wins the race.

‘I think ultimately it did cost me the win,’ said Hamilton, who now must finish second at the season finale to guarantee this year's title.

‘I was much quicker up until that point and then on that lap I had gone a second quicker. I thought I was going to pit at the end of that lap so I had used up everything in the tyres and on the next lap I had nothing left.

‘I made a mistake and locked the rears into Turn 4 and without the rotation it just spun me around - the second time it has happened this weekend. It was nobody's fault but mine.’

The victory was Rosberg’s first since July, and the German was delighted to have ended his team-mate’s five-race winning streak.

'It was a great weekend all in all,' Rosberg, who saw Hamilton overtake him for the race victory last time out in Texas, said. 

‘Austin was a tough day for me, so it was important for me just to improve. I didn't do a good enough job in Austin and today I managed to do that. That I'm happy about.’
