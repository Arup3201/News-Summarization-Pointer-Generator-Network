Nick Clegg today looks to his wife Miriam to help the Lib Dems in the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power.

The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. 

Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time', as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today looked to wife Miriam for support as he warned his party has the 'fight of our lives' to survive at the next election

The Lib Dem conference in Glasgow got underway with the party on just 6 per cent in the polls.

However, Mr Clegg is adamant that he could yet hold the balance of power, if Labour and the Conservatives both fall short of an overall majority.

Embarking on a whirlwind of TV and radio interviews, Mr Clegg attacked both other parties.

He said both of the larger parties had veered away from the political centre ground since the last election, while Lib Dems wanted both a 'stronger economy and a fairer society'.

Asked by Sky News whether he would rather 'get into bed' with Mr Cameron or Mr Miliband in a hung parliament, Mr Clegg insisted: 'Miriam, every single time, if you must put it that way.'

The Cleggs are expected to make a joint appearance at a school today to promote Lib Dem policies on free school meals and childcare.

The Lib Dem leader added: 'I really do think that if either Labour or the Conservatives were to run this country on their own again, the country would go backwards. It would go backwards economically under Labour, it would go backwards socially under Conservatives.

'I'm really pleased that we are the party saying that there's a more hopeful, positive vision of the future built around a simple old-fashioned liberal concept, which is opportunity for everybody.'

Mr Clegg's visit came after a media blitz of TV and radio interviews, in which he argued the Lib Dems did not face wipeout in 2015

Nigel Farage has faced claims a vote for UKIP makes a Labour government more likely

Voters who back UKIP at the next election risk 'going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband', David Cameron warned last week

The Prime Minister said the next election would be a 'straight fight' between Labour and the Tories, and a vote for UKIP made it more likely that Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister in 2015. 

The PM warned voters toying with the idea of voting UKIP that they were really voting for Labour

He told the Conservative conference: ''Let's be clear. This is a straight fight. It doesn't matter whether Parliament is hung, drawn or quartered, there is only one real choice.

'The Conservatives or Labour. Me in Downing Street, or Ed Miliband in Downing Street.

'If you vote UKIP – that's really a vote for Labour.'

He went on: 'Here's a thought: on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband. I don't know about you but not one bit of that works for me.

David Cameron warned that a vote for UKIP would make it easier for Labour to win the next election

He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'In the same way that Labour took a very sharp turn to the left, the Conservatives took a very sharp turn to the right.

'When I went into coalition with David Cameron, the Conservatives said they cared about the environment - they clearly don't. They wanted to protect civil liberties and human rights - they now want to trash them.

'And that they cared about the most vulnerable in society. And yet George Osborne said very clearly last week that their ambition if they were in government on their own is to only balance the books by making the working-age poor make additional sacrifices.'

He said the Lib Dems were making clear 'that's not a vision we share'. 

Mr Clegg was also forced to deny there was a 'flat' atmosphere spirit at this year's conference.

'It's an incredibly lively atmosphere here. People are really up for it, they're really up for the fight. 

'We know we've got the fight of our lives on our hands, but we're incredibly proud, as I say, of what we've done and actually people are really relishing getting out there to tell our side of the story on the campaign trail in the coming months.'

He also revealed he would be reading his main conference speech from a script, and not attempting to memorise it, as Labour leader Ed Miliband tried, but forgot to mention the deficit.

Mr Clegg said: 'I won't be doing the speech from memory. I think Ed Miliband has demonstrated the perils of doing that.'

A major split has opened up between the Tories and Lib Dems over how £25billion can be raised to eradicate the deficit after the election.

Last week Tory Chancellor George Osborne made clear it should come entirely from spending cuts, including £3billion from freezing benefits. 

But Mr Clegg has insisted some of the money should come from tax rises. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Our overall approach is that we want to maintain roughly what we have done in this government, which is that the bulk of the savings come from spending reductions, about 80 per cent but about 20 per cent come from tax increases.'

On BBC Breakfast, Mr Clegg hinted that he would allow an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU if he entered a new coalition with the Tories.

'We have said in law for the first time ever, if there is a change in the rules of the European Union, the so called treaties, powers are moved from Westminster and Whitehall to Brussels, there will be a referendum. 

'I have gone even further than that, I have been saying for as long as I have been leader of this party, when that referendum takes place, the decision should be in or out. 

'Our position is clear, there will be a referendum, we have guaranteed it in law, when the rules of the game change in the European Union and new things are asked of the United Kingdom and I believe that when that is held the question on the ballot paper should be in or out.'

Appearing on Sky News Radio/IRN, Mr Clegg admitted to mistakes in the early days of the coalition, saying he disappeared into the 'boiler room' of government to make 'gory decisions' but failed to speak to the public about what he was doing.

Mr Clegg admitted that the Lib Dems 'slightly lost our voice' in the first year or so of the coalition, as he disappeared into the 'boiler room' of government to take 'gory' decisions

In an attempt to differentiate the Lib dems from both parties, Mr Clegg launched attacks on the Tories on fairness and Labour on the economy

Mr Clegg insisted that despite being at just 6 per cent in the polls, the Lib Dems are not heading for disaster in 2015

Asked what he would do differently if he found himself in a coalition administration again after next May's poll, Mr Clegg said: 'I think probably what we wouldn't need to do next time is what we had to do this time, which was, right at the beginning, I slightly disappeared into the boiler room of the Government to make sure we took all these difficult, gory and, frankly, unpopular decisions to pull the economy back from the brink where we found it and to prove to people that coalition government could work.

'I think we slightly lost our voice in the first year or so of the coalition Government and that probably was inevitable because we needed to show people that coalition government could work.

'I think now people are used to the idea that coalition is what it says on the tin - two parties with different identities - and I think we could be more relaxed about that openly from day one if we were to be in coalition again.'

Mr Clegg dismissed suggestions that his party, which has slumped to as little as 6 per cent support in the polls, is heading for disaster in the 2015 election.

'I've literally lost count of the times, with the greatest respect, that I've been asked questions saying 'Oh, isn't it going to be a disaster?

Aren't you going to be wiped out? Isn't it all going to be terrible?'.

And every time we confound the sceptics and I genuinely think we will do so next year,' he said.
