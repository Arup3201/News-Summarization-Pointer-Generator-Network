John Carver has hit back at suggestion Newcastle United deliberately fielded a weakened team in the FA Cup third round - and insists his conscience is clear.

The Magpies caretaker boss made seven changes for last Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Leicester City and has since come in for heavy criticism from supporters and former players, including Alan Shearer.

Newcastle’s hierarchy have previously gone on record in downgrading the importance of the cup competitions and fans were suspicious that Carver had been instructed to pick a team which did not include star players such as Moussa Sissoko and skipper Fabricio Coloccini.

Carver, though, says that he - on the advice of medical staff - selected the XI which performed so poorly at the Kind Power Stadium.

‘I would like to put the record straight,’ he said. ‘I have not had a conversation with Mike (Ashley, the owner). I had a conversion with Lee Charnley (managing director) late on Friday night.

‘I said to Lee “this is the team that is playing tomorrow”. That is a fact. I then told him “these are the reasons why this is the team”.

‘He was a little bit surprised, I have to be honest. I picked the strongest team I could. So I have clear conscience of that.’

And Carver - who is hoping to replace Alan Pardew on a permanent basis - says he felt sick when the fitness concerns were relayed to him.

'I took medical advice from the doctor. I actually physically felt sick when he told me about Colo, Moussa and Daryl Janmaat,’ he explained.

‘Now he is the expert in this field and I have to trust his judgement. Moussa has a tight right hamstring and we’re not going to force any player with a problem to play.

‘I went on enough about how important I think the FA Cup is. You don’t think I will harp on like that because I want to win it and then all of a sudden make the decision that these guys won’t play. I made that decision for the right reasons.’

All of those missing at Leicester, however, are expected to feature at Chelsea on Saturday.

Carver insists that there were genuine fitness concerns with a number of players before the Leicester game

And Carver has been boosted by the return to fitness of goalkeeper Tim Krul, who he rates as one of the best in the Premier League.

‘It will be a tremendous boost for everyone,’ he said with Krul having been out since November. ‘You’ve got to have confidence in the person whose behind you and we’ve conceded a lot of goals recently, so to have Tim between the sticks would be massive.

‘He’s up there with Courtois and De Gea and for me.’

Meanwhile, Shola Ameobi will not be returning to the club. The free agent has been at the training ground this week receiving treatment on an ankle injury but is targeting a move to the MLS.
