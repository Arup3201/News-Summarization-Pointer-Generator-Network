Spain is launching a crackdown on drunk tourists and is considering introducing breathalyser tests for pedestrians in a bid to make their streets safer.

The proposals, suggested by the country's Directorate General of Traffic, are intended to stop visitors to the country from staggering into the path of oncoming cars after they've been drinking.

Anybody stopped by police officers on Spanish streets could be asked to take a breathalyser or drugs test if they are believed to be implicated in a road traffic accident.

The proposals would also re-class pedestrians as road users, who have the same responsibility to keep safe as drivers.

But according to the Guardian, the plan has been criticised by several members of the Spanish government because there hasn't been a limit imposed on what constitutes as too much alcohol.

Concerns have also been raised that it would breach privacy and freedom of people in the country.

But the traffic directorate insist that police can already carry out alcohol and drugs tests on pedestrians, who are thought to have broken the law.

Maria Segui Gomes, the organisation's director, said: 'Municipal police have been carrying out these tests for months – there is nothing new here that will allow us to start sanctioning pedestrians, whether economically or with penalty points.'

Other plans by the organisation have also included imposing speed limits on joggers and the possibility of fining people who leave the house without glasses, or wearing dark clothing at night.

In a 2011 study published in the Journal of Trauma, it found that 55 per cent of walkers under the influence of alcohol ignored pedestrian crossings, compared to just 22 per cent of sober ones.

In conclusion the research also urged traffic safety and injury prevention programmes to address irresponsible alcohol use in pedestrians.

Meanwhile a study last year in the UK found that one pedestrian in seven injured on the roads in Britain is drunk at the time.

Figures from the Department of Transport reveal more than 6,000 intoxicated pedestrians have been injured since 2011.
