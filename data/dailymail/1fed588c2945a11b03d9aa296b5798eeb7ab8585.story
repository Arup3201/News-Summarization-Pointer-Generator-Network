A woman who faked death to avoid prosecution for a £39 fraud has been handed a suspended sentence.

Victoria Sully, 32, pretended to be her own mother and made a series of emotional calls to court staff to make them think she was seriously ill.

Then, in a final call, they were told that she had passed away.

The mother of two was only caught years later when she was arrested following a domestic incident involving her partner.

Victoria Sully faked her own death to avoid appearing in court over a £39 fraud, after she paid for a tanning session on a stolen credit card

When police checked her details, one officer asked her: ‘Aren’t you supposed to be dead?’

She has now been handed a six-month suspended sentence after admitting fraud by false representation and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Yesterday Sully said she wanted to put the whole matter behind her, adding: ‘It was a long time ago and it’s all been dealt with.’

She also claimed that she hadn’t made the phone call reporting her death. Speaking at her detached three-bedroom house near Ashford in Kent, she insisted: ‘I didn’t make the call to say I was dead.

‘It was another girl. I found out a week and a half later but it was too late to do anything by then.’

Sully was arrested for using a stolen credit card to pay for a tanning session at a salon in October 2008. She was due to appear before magistrates the following June but failed to attend.

Court officials began to receive calls from a woman claiming to be her mother. In the first call, it was claimed she had suffered a miscarriage. 

Sully was spared a prison term. Judge David Goodin sitting at Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) handed the mother-of-two a six month suspended sentence, ordered her to do 200 hours of unpaid work

A few days later another stated she 
had undergone a hysterectomy and was having chemotherapy for 
cancer. Prosecutor Michael Crimp said this was supported by a hospital 
letter.

He told 
Ipswich Crown Court that Sully had received a genuine letter following a
 smear test which mentioned ‘borderline’ cell changes.

By
 the time the part-time supermarket worker had finished tampering with 
it, it suggested she was receiving urgent hospital treatment.

The final call in which her death was announced led staff to end proceedings on February 25, 2010. Her file was marked ‘defendant deceased’.

Sully evaded detection until New Year’s Eve 2012 when police were called to her home following a report of a dispute with her partner.

Judge David Goodin also sentenced Sully to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

He said she must provide a medical certificate if she couldn’t make any of the sessions – and warned her not to  hand in forged documents.

Oliver Kirk, defending, told the court: ‘She had to die or face up to it. You could say the offence has come back to haunt her from her own grave.’
