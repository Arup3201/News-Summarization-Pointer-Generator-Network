Three is often a crowd but not for these koala joeys.

The trio recently moved away from their mothers but they quickly took comfort with each other and were caught snoozing and spooning together at Taronga Zoo in Sydney.

Sydney, Milli and Tucker have been tree-mates for the past month and they are often spotted eating or sleeping close together – and occasionally on top of each other.

Ultimate cuddle: Keepers at Sydney's Taronga Zoo spotted three koala joeys snoozing and spooning together in a tree

Sydney, Milli and Tucker have been tree-mates for the past month after leaving their mothers. They are often spotted eating or sleeping close together - and occasionally on top of each other

The two females, Sydney and Milli, are nearly 18 months old, while male Tucker is the youngest at 12 months old.

'Tucker is usually the poor guy on the bottom. I think he goes to sleep first and then the girls find a comfy spot on top of him,' koala keeper, Laura Jones said.

'He seems to quite like it at the moment though as it may remind him of cuddling with his mum.'

Ms Jones said the three joeys could remain together for up to a year if they continue to get along.

'Koalas quite enjoy a cuddle when they're juveniles, but as they get older they become more independent and want their own space,' she said.

'If these three start battling over places to perch we'll separate them, but at the moment they're very happy living together.'
