Classical music: Fast-food chain McDonald's hopes its response will help pacify customers

Fast-food chain McDonald's has started playing classical music in an attempt to pacify late night customers and stop drunken fights breaking out on its premises.

Yobbish behaviour has soared in Stockport town centre including in the area around McDonald's Grand Central restaurant.

To help tackle the escalating problem, the outlet hopes playing classical music from Brahms to Beethoven will have a soothing effect on revellers, who have spilled out of the nearby clubs and pubs and are looking for something to help soak up the alcohol.

Stockport council has used the tactic before.

Two years ago classical music was piped into an alleyway near Councillor Lane in Cheadle to try and disperse nuisance youths.

But it is the first time it has been used inside a business.

Cllr Philip Harding said: 'The idea is they (yobs) would disperse as it's not their scene. I believed it was successful but it's a bit of a different suggestion inside a business.

'I like classical music but I'm not sure the patrons of McDonald's do.'

McDonald's has already tried to tackle antisocial behaviour problems by joining a neighbourhood crime fighting team run by local police.

Stockport Business Watch Exclusion has around 70 members and crimes committed against one can lead to a banning order covering all.

Police have also sent letters home to the parents of antisocial youngsters caught misbehaving at the burger chain.

A McDonald's spokesman said: 'Our first priority is to ensure that our restaurants are safe and welcoming environments for both customers and staff, so we take antisocial behaviour very seriously.

'We work closely with police to prevent incidents and where necessary exclude those who repeatedly cause a nuisance.

'We have also held meetings with young people and parents to encourage good behaviour.'

A council spokesman said: 'The classical music clearly differentiates between the nightclub atmosphere that some customers have just left and the more serene family restaurant that McDonald's aims to provide.'
