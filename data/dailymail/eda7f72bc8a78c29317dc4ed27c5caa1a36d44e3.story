A Virginia man who punched and strangled his two-year-old daughter to death claiming that she was possessed by a demon has been jailed for 20 years.

Eder Guzman-Rodriguez told police that he punched Jocelyn 'over and over' after he claims he saw his daughter gesturing to him as if she wanted to fight.

Guzman-Rodriguez, 30, told police in Floyd that his daughter was possessed and that he had tried to exorcise her.

He claimed that the demon 'used' his body to kill the child.

In a plea bargain, Guzman-Rodriguez did not contest a first-degree murder charge and was sentenced to 20 years and 11 months in prison.

Originally from Mexico, Guzman-Rodriguez will be deported once he has served his sentence.

Floyd County Court heard that police were called to reports of the death of a child on November 23 2011.

The first deputy who arrived on the scene said that he saw 'several Hispanics holding Bibles' standing on the deck of a mobile home.

Police found Guzman-Rodriguez's wife Carmen Nolazco crying with visible injuries to her head, face and chest.

The court heard that she could not have prevented Jocelyn's death because she had been beaten unconscious before Guzman-Rodriguez attacked the two-year-old.

Jocelyn was found by officers wrapped in a blanket with no pulse.

Attorney Stephanie Shortt said that Guzman Rodriguez told police: 'I know I am the one who hit her, I was the only one there.

'The demon used my body to kill her.'

Jocelyn suffered a catalogue of horrific injuries - which included fractured ribs, abrasions and hemorrhages.

The cause of death was manual asphyxiation, Shortt said.
