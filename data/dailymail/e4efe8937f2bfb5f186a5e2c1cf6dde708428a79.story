It's not often fans get a look at what Premier League players get up to in the changing room - never mind the bathroom.

But with the Premier League throwing its backing behind a new cancer campaign, players including Jay Rodriguez, Georgios Samaras and Carlton Cole are all bizarrely posing in toilets to raise awareness among supporters.

It's all part of the 'Blood in Pee' campaign which aims to gets fans aware that men face a higher risk of developing and dying from bladder and kidney cancer than women.

Posters and stickers are going up in toilets at grounds across the country with fans urged to tell their doctor if they notice blood in their urine.

Liverpool, West Ham, West Brom and Southampton are all involved -  raising awareness that despite only 1 in 3 people surviving bladder or kidney cancer beyond 12 months if diagnosed at a late stage, 43% of people would wait until they saw blood in their pee at least a second time before they contacted their GP.

'As a footballer I am always keeping an eye on my health and we want our fans and their loved ones to do the same,' said Southampton striker Rodriguez.

'If you notice something unusual, like blood in pee, you should always go straight to your doctor. That’s why I’m supporting the Be Clear on Cancer campaign, to raise awareness amongst fans of the signs of bladder and kidney cancer.' 

Davidson holds up the slogan, to appear in toilets, while his team-mate's relieve themselves

Cole wasn't snapped using the toilet, but still threw his backing behind the Be Clear on Cancer campaign

Simon Morgan, the Premier League's Head of Community Development, said: 'The Premier League is proud to be supporting the Be Clear on Cancer ‘Blood in Pee’ campaign.

'The health of football fans across the country is a serious issue, with men more at risk of developing and dying from bladder and kidney cancer than women. This campaign, being delivered with the help of Premier League clubs, is hugely important in raising awareness of a key sign of these cancers.' 

The posters and stickers will greet fans visiting the toilets at Liverpool's Anfield ground in the coming weeks
