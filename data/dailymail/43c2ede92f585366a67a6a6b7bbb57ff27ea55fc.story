Being able to help yourself to drinks in a pub sounds like an idyllic dream, but one pub owner in Swansea is attempting to bring this slice of utopia to reality.

Mark Lingwood has spent more than £20,000 to open Britain's first state-of-the-art iPub, The Westbourne in Swansea.

Customers who visit the establishment can now pull their own perfect pint after they place an order on an iPad.

Self-service: Customers at The Westbourne in Swansea can serve their own drinks

With screens scattered throughout the unusual public house, customers will be able to pay for their drinks in advance.

Or they can open a tab so they can be given a special card, which is scanned with a sensor at the iPad on their table. for drinkers which are markedly different than traditional practices. 

Mr Lingwood said a similar pub is opening in Edinburgh and he is confident the ambitious idea could be adopted throughout the country. 

First: The Westbourne in Swansea is Britain's first state of the art iPub

iPad: Customers have an iPad at each table where they can place their orders

Positive: Publican Mark Lingwood said his customers are very happy with the new initiative

The publican said his customers seem to be very happy about the novel idea.

Mr Lingwood said, 'Fingers crossed it'll spread throughout the country. I think it's great for our customers to try something new, to have that little bit of extra fun in the evening.' 

However, not all of the customers are completely behind the initiative.

Customer Leon Bartoszewicz raised his concerns about the possibility of children accessing alcoholic drinks with the new ordering technology and asked, 'How does that machine know your age?'

Mr Bartoszewicz said he believed there was nothing to stop a child using the machine.
