Pictured for the first time, these are the 11 men and women who have admitted carrying out a sustained campaign of neglect, abuse and torture aimed at the vulnerable patients they were meant to care for.

BBC's Panorama caught them attacking disabled patients, with shocking footage showing victims being slapped, kicked, sat on and drenched with water at Winterbourne View care home in Bristol.

And now a year on from those disturbing revelations these workers have admitted cruelty charges, and will be sentenced later this year.

The final and now 11th former worker 
arrested, Michael Ezenagu, 28, pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court 
today to the ill treatment of patients.

Wayne
Rogers, 31, Graham Doyle, 25, Allison Dove, 24, Jason Gardiner, 
42, Charlotte Cotterell, 21, Holly Draper, 22, all admitted similar 
offences. While Kelvin Fore, 32, Sookalingun Appoo, 58, and Danny Brake,
26, and Neil Ferguson, 28, have also previously admitted neglect.

A five-week undercover investigation, screened last June, filmed abuse at the privately-owned, purpose-built, 24-bed facility, on the outskirts of Bristol.

Following today's case Avon and Somerset Police released mugshots of the 11 defendants for the first time.

Detective Chief Superintendent Louisa Rolfe said: 'I wish to acknowledge the support and patience of the victims and their families throughout our inquiry.

Inquiry: Panorama filmed residents at Winterbourne View being assaulted and bullied. This poor woman was dragged across the floor

'We were shocked by the Panorama programme as many people were. The voice of the victim has been central to our investigation into this case.

'The investigation has always been about the criminal actions of eleven individuals working at Winterbourne View.

'The 11 individuals abused the trust of victims and that of their relatives and friends.

'They have all pleaded guilty to criminal offences of ill treatment and neglect as detailed within the Mental Health Act.

'Had it not been for the actions of individuals who raised concerns about the neglect and cruelty suffered by the victims at Winterbourne View, this wholly unacceptable behaviour would have continued unchecked.

'We now await sentencing which will bring the criminal justice process to a final conclusion.'

Police launched an inquiry after being shown footage of disabled adults being violated at Winterbourne View care home - run by Castlebeck Care.

Whistle-blower Terry Bryan, a former senior nurse at Winterbourne, tipped off the BBC after his repeated approaches to authorities appeared to fall on deaf ears.

Panorama journalist Joe Casey wore a secret camera to film apparent shocking scenes of abuse on patients by staff - who were meant to be looking after them.

The reporter captured footage of some of the hospital's most vulnerable patients, who suffer from autism and learning difficulties, being repeatedly pinned down. Some were slapped and dragged into showers while fully clothed, others were taunted and teased.

Mr Casey told the BBC documentary: 'On a near-daily basis, I watched as some of the very people entrusted with the care of society's most vulnerable targeted patients - often, it seemed, for their own amusement.

'They are scenes of torment that are not easily forgotten.'

Andrew McDonnell, a leading expert in working with adults with mental disabilities, labelled some of the examples captured on film 'torture'.

Mr McDonnell, a clinical psychologist, said he was shocked by the treatment of vulnerable patients at the hands of those charged with their care.

Castlebeck Care - which has 24 locations across the country - closed Winterbourne View on June 24, after transferring all patients to alternative services.

The controversial care home was found to have 'systematically failed' to protect patients from abuse, a damning report ruled in July.

Ann Redropp, head of the CPS Complex Case Team, said: 'Safety and security, and the ability to live free from fear and harassment, are fundamental human rights.

'The kind of offending that took place at Winterbourne View undermined these rights in an appalling and systematically brutal way.

'The CPS has treated these as Disability Hate Crimes, which we regard as particularly serious.

'Disability Hate Crimes are based on ignorance, prejudice and hate.

'Disabled people can be victims of crime due to their perceived vulnerability, particularly where there is an unequal relationship, such as where the perpetrator is the victim's carer.

'At Winterbourne View, people who should have been able to trust their carers had that trust cruelly and repeatedly abused.'

A Serious Case Review in the Winterbourne Care Home scandal will be published tomorrow.
