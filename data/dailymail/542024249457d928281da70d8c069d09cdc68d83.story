The mother of both boys and Bluntson's girlfriend, Brandy Cerny was also found dead in a shed 200 miles away in the family's hometown of El Campo, Texas.

The investigation into her death continues but she was believed to have gunshot wounds. 

Bluntson was also charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against a public servant and one count of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury. He was being held without bond.

The father was arrested  at the Holiday Inn-Civic Center in Laredo. Police had gone to the hotel at midday on Tuesday after receiving a call from colleagues in El Campo concerned for Bluntson's son and his girlfriend's son.

Police began an investigation on Monday when Miss Cerny's father Lloyd filed a missing person's report when she did not show up to work. Authorities followed several leads which led them to the Laredo hotel.

When officers knocked the door of the room on the 14th floor, they identified themselves as 
police and then heard several shots. One bullet came 
through the room door and narrowly missed two officers.

Police cleared the building, which was full of guests because of a convention, then entered the room and arrested Bluntson.

The boys' mother had not checked into the hotel, it was confirmed. She was discovered by a neighbor at a property where Bluntson used to keep dogs but not where the family lived. 

Pro8News reported that Bluntson had checked into the hotel with the young boys using his girlfriend's credit card.

Holiday Inn management refused to comment on this allegation to MailOnline.
