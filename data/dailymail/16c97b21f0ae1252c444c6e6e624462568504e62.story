RBS must be split into a ‘good’ and ‘bad’ bank and returned to the private sector sooner rather than later, Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King urged today.

In a surprisingly outspoken criticism of how RBS has been run, the outgoing governor said the Government had failed to take decisive action to overhaul RBS and called the current system a ‘nonsense’.

He said the bank must undergo a radical restructure within a year to create a healthy lender. Taxpayers will have to bear the costs of reprivatisation, he said, warning that RBS is currently holding the wider economy back.

Outspoken: Sir Mervyn King called for RBS to be reprivatised

'The whole idea of a bank being 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer, run at arms' length from the government, is a nonsense. It cannot make any sense,' he told a parliamentary committee.

'The arguments for restructuring sooner rather than later are powerful ones.'

He added it was 'not beyond the wit of man' to split RBS into a 'good' and 'bad' bank to ensure the cleaned-up group could support lending and boost economic recovery efforts.

'The lessons of history is that we 
should face up to it - it's worth less than we thought and we should 
accept that and get back to finding a way to create a new RBS that could
be a major lender to the UK economy,' he said.

Sir
Mervyn's comments will come as a blow after RBS boss Stephen Hester 
last week insisted the bank's return to the private sector was on track 
and could be completed within two years.

They also come just days after Chancellor George Osborne appeared to rule out a split and reprivatisation of the bank. 

The Chancellor told Commission on 
Banking Standards last week that the process could take up to three 
years and cost between £8billion and £10billion to buy out minority 
shareholders in RBS.

‘The obstacles to your approach [splitting and reprivatising the bank] are very considerable ... One has to ask whether the benefits of that two or three-year process would greatly outweigh the benefits of the current strategy,’ he argued.

Sir Mervyn King today said he had discussed his view with the Chancellor, but acknowledged that it would be difficult to push through reforms from a 'presentational' point of view because they would increase levels of national debt.

Shares in RBS fell after King's comments and were trading at 312p in mid-morning trading, down 0.8 per cent on the day.

King said it should not take more than a year to a carry out a much more decisive restructuring of RBS than efforts to date.

The Bank has taken an increasingly tough line on the amount of capital banks hold and the government has chosen Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, a leader of the global push for stronger banking regulation, to succeed King at the Bank in July.

RBS last week claimed improvements in the core bank would see it return to financial health next year as it reported underlying group operating profits nearly doubling to £3.5 billion in 2012 from £1.8 billion in 2011.

But bottom-line figures revealed the fifth year of losses since its £45.5 billion government bailout in 2008, plunging into the red by £5.2 billion in 2012.

The Bank also hit out at European Union plans to impose a cap on banker bonuses, warning they will fail to rein in excessive pay and will only force up fixed salaries that cannot be clawed back.

Proposals revealed last week to limit bonuses to a maximum of a year's salary or double that if explicitly backed by shareholders, will act as a ‘distraction’ to efforts to change the culture of pay within the banking industry, according to Sir Mervyn.

Andrew Bailey, incoming deputy governor at the Bank and chief executive designate of the new Prudential Regulation Authority, added it could set back recent progress made to reduce overall bonus pools, defer awards and introduce clawbacks of past bonuses.

‘My concern is that in setting this limit, it runs the risk of pushing up fixed remuneration - that's cash out of the door and it's much harder to get that back if needed,’ said Mr Bailey.
