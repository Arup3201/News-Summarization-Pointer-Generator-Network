The 'common sense' guide has been issued to minimise the risk of contamination of Ebola in the event the virus reaches the UK

Staff at GP practices across the country have been provided with a ‘common sense’ guide to dealing with patients suspected of having Ebola.

The step-by-step advice, provided by the Royal College of General Practitioners, has been designed to minimise the risk of the infection spreading in the event it reaches the UK. 

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the country to expect a 'handful' of cases by Christmas. 

The guidance, presented in the form of an index card, has been designed to ensure that patients receive the best and fastest care possible whilst protecting practice teams from possible contamination. 

It is tailored to individual members of GP practice teams, including receptionists and telephone call handlers, practice managers, and duty doctors.

Each 'Ebola Action Card' outlines their specific duties and responsibilities if a patient arrives with Ebola-type symptoms or rings the surgery for advice.

Patient advice is also included, with recommendations for what to do if they are in a GP practice or at home.

Any patient who arrives with a potential case of Ebola will be told to go to an isolation room and will then be assessed by the duty doctor over an internal phone system. 

If Ebola is a serious possibility, doctors are asked to alert an infectious-disease specialist at the nearest hospital. 

Compiled by Dr Simon Stockley, a GP from Stockton-On-Tees, the cards provide a practical and common-sense approach to the current crisis, as well as much-needed reassurance for staff and patients in general practice.

RCGP Chair Dr Maureen Baker said: 'The threat of Ebola to the UK remains low but GPs and practice staff are on the front line of dealing with contagious diseases and they need to be fully aware of what steps to take in order to protect patients and themselves, should an incident or potential incident arise.

'Dr Stockley has an impressive background in emergency preparedness and we are delighted to be working with him on such an important initiative. 

'His guidance takes a calm, measured and common sense approach to the current situation – exactly what general practice needs.

'It will reassure all members of the GP practice team and should make all frontline health professionals feel more prepared and confident about handling any potential incident.'

The college has set up a dedicated Ebola page on its website, bringing together the latest information on the virus. 

Last month, Public Health England warned GP surgeries and walk-in centres they would have to be temporarily closed if patients with bleeding, vomiting or diarrhoea are suspected of having Ebola.

Ebola is a viral infection currently present in West Africa. It is infectious and potentially fatal. Where possible it is important that patients are assessed where they present least risk to health workers. Anyone with features of Ebola who has travelled from West Africa should be kept at home and phoned back by the duty doctor. They should not be brought to the surgery or listed for home visiting.

All patients phoning with symptoms of fever, headache, muscle or joint pains, weakness, diarrhoea, vomiting or abnormal bleeding should be asked:

1) Have you been abroad in the last 21 days?

2) Have you been to West Africa, particularly which country?

IF YES ASK THE PATIENT TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE

3) What number can we call you back on?

4) What is your current address?

Actions:

· Contact the duty doctor, as a matter of urgency

· Alert the Senior practice administrator on duty as to the nature of the call 

Ebola is a viral infection currently present in West Africa. It is infectious and potentially fatal. Where possible it is important that patients are assessed where they present least risk to health workers. Anyone with features of Ebola who has travelled from West Africa should be kept at home and phoned back by the duty doctor. They should not be brought to the surgery or listed for home visiting.

All patients presenting with symptoms of fever, headache, muscle or joint pains, weakness, diarrhoea, vomiting or abnormal bleeding should be asked:

1) Have you been abroad in the last 21 days?

2) Have you been to West Africa, particularly which country?

IF YES ASK TAKE THE PATIENT DIRECTLY TO THE ISOLATION ROOM

3) Ask them to take a seat and wait for the doctor to telephone them?

4) Ask them to remain in the room and to call reception on xxx if they have any concerns

Actions:

· Contact the duty doctor, as a matter of urgency

· Alert the senior practice administrator on duty that you have placed a patient in the isolation room.

In the event of a patient either reporting symptoms or concerns about Ebola to a telephone receptionist, the front of house receptionist or a member of the medical team you will be contacted.

Your role will be to coordinate the use of staff to minimise exposure of patients and staff to contamination from the virus.

If the patient is not in the building:

1) Ensure that they are being telephoned by the duty doctor

2) Alert reception staff to the possibility of people presenting concerned about Ebola

If the patient has presented to the practice:

· Ensure that the patient is within the Isolation Room and that the duty doctor is aware of their presence.

· Ensure no member of staff has physical contact with the patient.

· Await Duty Doctor’s assessment and any discussions with hospital

If the patient is to be assessed as a possible Ebola case:

· Restrict access to areas of the premises as guided by Local Health Protection Team.

· Do not attempt to clear any gross contamination, (vomit, blood or faeces) until results are known and situation discussed with local health protection team.

· Consider what business continuity arrangements may need to be made

Be aware that it may take 12 hours to get a definitive test result

In the event of a patient either reporting symptoms or concerns regarding their having Ebola to yourself during a consultation you should consider the following.

1. Assess the patient’s history of exposure risk and fever using the current algorithm

2. Avoid physical contact with them if they merit further assessment according to the algorithm.

3. Consider whether it is more appropriate to keep them in the consultation room (i.e. already contaminated with vomit, blood or faeces) or to place them in the pre-planned isolation room (i.e. no gross contamination present)

4. Inform the Duty Doctor and Senior Administrative team member

5. Agree who will contact hospital team for further advice

6. Consider restricting further clinical contacts with other patients until assessment process has determined if further tests to exclude Ebola are required. Seek guidance from Local Health Protection Team if required.

7. Similarly consider if consultation room should be closed until assessment process has been completed.

Any inadvertent contamination should be reported and soap and water used to clean skin splashes.

In the event of a patient either reporting symptoms or concerns to a telephone receptionist, the front of house receptionist or a member of the medical team you will be contacted.Your role will be to carry out the initial verbal assessment of the patient

If the patient is not in the building:

1) Ensure that they are telephoned back as a matter of priority

2) Assess the patient using the current algorithm

3) If Ebola is a potential risk alert your local microbiologist/virologist/infectious diseases consultant and take their advice as to further assessment of your patient

4) DO NOT VISIT or INVITE THE PATIENT TO SURGERY until you are sure there is no potential risk

If the patient has presented to the practice

· Ensure that the patient is within the Isolation Room

· Talk to the patient on the internal telephone, or from outside the room. Internal Telephone No XXX

· Do not enter the room or carry out a physical examination

· If Ebola is a potential risk alert your local microbiologist/virologist/infectious diseases consultant and take their advice as to further assessment of your patient

· Liaise with Practice Manager / Senior Administrative Team Leader to ensure safety of staff and other patients

Be aware if the patient is assessed as a possible Ebola case it may take 12 hours to get a definitive test result

Dear Patient,

Because of your recent ill health and travel history we have taken the precaution of placing you in our isolation room. This is to ensure that you can be cared for safely and any possible infection is not spread further.

· One of our doctors will call you very shortly on the telephone, please pick up the receiver when it rings.

· They will want to know about your symptoms, when they started, and how they have changed.

· They will also want to know where you have travelled from, when you were there, and if you had contact with anyone who was unwell whilst there.

· In the room you will find a thermometer, please use it to take your temperature by pressing the button by the small display screen, placing the silver end in your mouth for 90 seconds and reading the number on the screen

If you need to contact us PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE THE ROOM but phone reception on XXX.

Should you need to use a toilet please use the toilet directly opposite this room.

The doctor who calls you will explain what will happen after they have talked with you and decided if you are potentially infectious. If the doctor decides you need to go to the hospital, they will arrange appropriate transport to get you there.
