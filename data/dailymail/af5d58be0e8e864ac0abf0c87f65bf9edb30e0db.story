Valerie Trierweiler has blamed 'low blows', 'betrayals' and 'back-stabbing' for her break-up from Francois Hollande last weekend.

Speaking in India, where she is currently touring children's hospitals, Trierweiler claimed that she had no desire to become First Lady and that she would have dated Hollande even if he had not won the election.

She added that the ambition to become elected was Hollande's alone, and that she now feels 'liberated' from a life in power and is looking forward to returning to a normal existence.

Representing France: Trierweiler speaks to a mother in the slum while holding a young child during her charity trip to India

'I used to date a president': The journalist, whose relationship with the French president ended over the weekend, still went through with the India visit

It has been reported that Ms Trierweiler is looking to forge a new career as a goodwill ambassador following the breakdown of her relationship

All good: Ms Trierweiler has ensured the press that she is on good terms with President Hollande after their breakup and speaks to him 'every day'

According to The Telegraph,
 Trierweiler, 48, says she has spoken to Hollande on the phone every day
 since he announced he was ending their 'shared life together.'

Hollande
 apparently called her on the first day of her trip to Mumbai, where she
 launched a charity in defiance of Elysee staff, and again after a press
 conference yesterday when she stressed their relationship would not be 
rekindled.

Trierweiler has 
also confirmed that she will not be returning to the 'cynicism' of 
political journalism following the split, and instead plans to launch a 
career as a humanitarian campaigner.

Yesterday she visited sick children at the Sion children's hospital in Mumbai in a
 visit that echoed much of the humanitarian work that earned Princess 
Diana the nickname 'Queen of Hearts' following her divorce from Prince 
Charles in 1996.

Ambition: Valerie Trierweiler has said she never wanted to become First Lady and that she would have dated Francois Hollande whether he had become president or not

Humanitarian: She says she has no desire to return to the 'cynical' world of political journalism and will instead become a humanitarian campaigner

Treacherous: Trierweiler also blamed 'backstabbing' and 'betrayals' for her split from president Hollande

On speaking terms: Hollande has apparently phoned Trierweiler every day since he announced their split

Love rivals: Ms Trierweiler, left, has herself just spent eight days in a Paris hospital suffering from the stress of finding out Mr Hollande, 59, was having an affair with the actress Julie Gayet, 41, pictured, right, at the Dauphin jewellery launch in Paris - her first official engagement following revelations of the affair

Asked if she was particularly proud of
 anything during her relatively short time as first lady, Ms Trierweiler
 said: ‘I don't know if it's for me to judge, or for you.

‘I
 was there for 19 months. I was able to meet people I didn’t know 
before. I understood that you can be useful, and in being useful to 
others you can be useful to yourself.’

‘It
 is very touching to see these babies weighing less than a kilogramme 
and with very limited life chances,’ said Ms Trierweiler.

‘It’s an 
injustice because even if everything is done to make them better, they 
don’t have the same facilities as in our hospitals.’

Back to business: Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande met with Turkish President Abdullah Gul in Ankara, Turkey, on Monday during a two day visit to an economic forum bringing the two countries together

Timing: President Hollande visit coincided with a political crisis plaguing the Turkish government and turmoil in his own private life

Proud: Earlier in the day she refused to answer questions about her turbulent private life and, dressed in a navy blue jacket and skirt, looked distinctly calm and unemotional

Fired: Mr Hollande officially 'fired' Ms Trierweiler on Saturday – signalling the end of her 10 months as a first lady in a curt 18 word statement. When asked today what she would do now, she said she didn't know but told journalists: 'Don't worry about me'

Ms Trierweiler 
has herself just spent eight days in a Paris hospital suffering from the
 extreme stress of finding out that Mr Hollande, 59, was having an 
affair with the actress Julie Gayet, 41.

Looking distinctly calm and unemotional, 
Mrs Trierweiler denied claims that her trip was an unnecessary strain on
 French tax payers’ money, saying: ‘You see, you can’t say I’m wasting 
public money, I’ve only got a bodyguard’.

In fact, Patrice Biancone,
 her ex chief of staff, is also on the trip, and she said of Ms 
Trierweiler: ‘She has not become an ordinary citizen, she is an ex first
 lady, which gives her a different status.’

Mr Hollande officially 
‘fired’ Ms Trierweiler on Saturday – signalling the end of her time as  
first lady in a curt 18 word statement.

The Paris Match magazine 
journalist’s charity trip to India will certainly be the last she enjoys
 with all the trappings of a VIP dignitary.

'Queen of Hearts': Determined to portray herself as a Gallic 'Queen of Hearts' in the tradition of the late Princess Diana, Ms Trierweiler posed for pictures with patients at the Sion children's hospital in Mumbai

Raising awareness: Ms Trierweiler is in India for a two-day trip to raise awareness about child malnutrition

Mr Hollande has made it 
clear that he wants her to return to ordinary life, staying away from 
the Elysee Palace and living in the modest flat they once shared in 
Paris’s unfashionable 15th arrondissement.

Friends have indicated 
that she wants financial compensation from the President, who fears that
 she will turn into a loose cannon who could damage him.

Mr
 Hollande, who had never married, is now expected to remain a ‘bachelor 
president’ for a while, while continuing with his relationship with Ms 
Gayet outside the Elysee.

Ms Gayet has not spoken since the pictures 
were published of Mr Hollande leaving their Paris love nest on the back 
of a moped, while using a crash helmet as a poor disguise.
