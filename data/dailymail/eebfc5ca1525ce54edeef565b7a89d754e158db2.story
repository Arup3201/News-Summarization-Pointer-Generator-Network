Peering at rows of engagement rings to find the perfect design may soon be a thing of the past.

3D printing group, MakerBot, has released a new app that will allow anyone to print a customised engagement ring to the perfect size and shape.

The Brooklyn-based company said the app is so simple to use, even people without technical knowledge can easily design jewellery in 3D.

3D printing group, MakerBot, has released an app that will allow anyone 
to print a customised engagement ring to the perfect size and shape on any of its printers - including the Replicator Mini (pictured). The
 Brooklyn-based company said the app lets users without technical 
knowledge to design a ring in 3D

That design is then sent wirelessly to a MakerBot 3D printer, such as the £999 ($1,700) Replicator Mini, according to a report by Pocket Lint.

The 3D printer builds up the ring, or any design, using layers of material.

Like a traditional inkjet printer, the material - usually plastic - is laid down on a base. Further layers are printed on top, gradually revealing the end product.

The
 design menu on the app (pictured) prints a two-part model - which can 
be an engagement ring or any other shape - that lets the users choose 
they you want on the top. Crucially, the free app also lets anyone 
change the finger size of rings to fit their future fiancée perfectly

3D printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file.

They work in an extremely simple way, by building up a 3D object from layers of material.

Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually plastic, is laid down on a base.

Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually revealing a 3D object.

The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace.

Shoes, jewellery and even dresses have been created, with designs often sold online.  

Crucially, the free app also lets anyone change the finger size to fit their future fiancée perfectly.

But
 unless you want to give your intended a plastic ring, the design will 
then have to be taken to a jewellers to be transformed into its diamond 
equivalent.

It’s
 the latest move by the 3D-printing community to make the technology, 
also known as rapid prototyping, available in the home.

Many believe
 it could even lead to 'mini factories' for living rooms allowing 
consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet. to a 
replacement part for a broken household appliance.

As
 well as rings and other jewellery, the software lets users create 
hundreds of other objects from their own designs, or from designs 
created by other users.

Open-source
 software tool, Thingverse, for instance, can be used by designers to 
share their creations with anyone on the internet.

Makerbot said the app will be available via the iTunes stores in the near future.
