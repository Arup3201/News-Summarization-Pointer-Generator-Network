A sister has received offers from dozens of from potential suitors... after her brother decided to place a 'commercial' pleading for a date for her on Facebook, Gumtree and the Free Ads website.

Adam Clarke, 26, decided it was about time his older sibling Natalie got a boyfriend, so he posted a video about his sister online.

'She hasn't had a boyfriend for a long while,' he says in the home-made clip, filmed in his car. 'Don't know whether it's because she's infertile, she's too old, whatever.'

'I'm not going to go into that because she'll kick off.'  

Adam and older sister Natalie are close, working together running media company Suave Productions

Adam recorded a video of his sister which he posted online alongside an advert for a date with her 

Although she admits she was originally cross with her brother, Natalie now is enjoying sifting through the responses from men hoping to date her - having whittled it down to between five and eight suitors 

'We need to get her a boyfriend because she's doing my head in!'

His unwitting sister then gets into the car, looking a tad taken aback when he explains what he's doing.  

He then continues: 'If anyone's interested, she's 33, she's got her own car, runs her own business, she's... I've run out of things to say about you. Anyway, if you're interested, add her on Facebook.' 

Adam put the video on Facebook without his sister's knowledge and then shared it on different sites such as Free Ads and Gumtree. 

When Natalie found out about the video she said 'at first I was shocked and kicked off but then I began to see the funny side and now I'm thankful'. 

The fact it was an an instant success and sparked multiple responses in just 24 hours may have helped.

'My laptop has not stopped beeping since,' says Natalie.  

Natalie scours the profiles of men who respond to the video, checking out their appearance and whether they can 'have a laugh' like her 

'It was not until we got home when he told me he shared it on his Facebook.'

Adam says the video has been watched over 8,000 times so far and Natalie has had around 70 messages.

She says she's whittled potential suitors down to between five and eight and may even be heading out on a date this week.

Adam apparently was prompted to place the adverts when he found a girlfriend himself and wanted Natalie (right) to also find a special someone for 'balance'  

Adam and Natalie work together running media company Suave Productions, based in Cardiff.

But after Adam found himself a girlfriend he felt 'it would be nice for her to have some balance, and get her head out of her laptop'. 

Asked what she looks for in a man, she said: 'I'll admit it's a little shallow but... looks. I'll look at their profile and through their timeline to see if they stand out, to see if they can have a laugh like me.'
