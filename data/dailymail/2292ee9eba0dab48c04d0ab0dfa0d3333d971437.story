Francesco Totti celebrated scoring an equaliser against rivals Lazio by grabbing a phone before taking a selfie in front of his side's supporters.

The Roma captain, who became the all-time top scorer in the history of the Rome derby by scoring in the 48th minute, fired home a brace to ensure his side came away from their  match against Lazio with a point.

Lazio paid tribute to the innocent victims of the Paris terrorists attacks by having the words 'Je suis Charlie' printed on to their shirts for their dramatic derby draw against Roma.

The 38-year-old became the all-time scorer in history of the Rome derbies by scoring in the 48th minute 

Stefano Mauri opened the lead for Lazio in the 25th minute when his left-footed strike nestled into the bottom corner of Morgan De Sanctis' goal.

Lazio, who were technically the away side despite sharing the Stadio Olimpico with their local rivals, doubled the lead just four minutes after the opening goal.

Felipe Anderson managed to get himself on the scoresheet after good work from team-mate Mauri to open up a two-goal lead for side.

However Roma got themselves back in the game when Totti got on the end of a cross by Kevin Strootman.

And Totti, who has now scored 11 goals in 40 games against Lazio, levelled the scoring when he scored from an acute angle before celebrating in unique fashion.
