Justin Bieber had YouTube to launch his platinum-selling career, and now a new teen Canadian heartthrob is using a fresh online tactic to dominate the charts. 

This Sunday, Toronto's Shawn Mendes took the No. 1 spot on iTunes with his debut album, capitalizing on the success of his massive following on Vine, where the 15-year-old old has spent years cultivating a base with of 2.9 million followers with short clips of his falsetto.

The Daily Dot reports it only took 37 minutes for The Shawn Mendes EP to top the charts, as his 1.47 million Twitter followers tweeted #shawntonumber1.

15-year-old Toronto singer Shawn Mendes has taken the top spot on iTunes sales charts with the help of his massive online following

Mendes has built a loyal audience over the last few years, posting regular clips of his falsetto to Vine and cultivating a Twitter following of millions

His debut single, 'Life of the Party,' has already been viewed more than 2.5 milion times on YouTube.

'I posted a six-second clip of me singing 'As Long As You Love Me' by 
Justin Bieber in August and it was an overnight sort of explosion,' he told Mashable. 'When I woke 
up and I had 10,000 likes on that video, I was like, ‘What is going on?’
 Social media is taking off. It’s an entire new world out there.'

Like any teen idol or online sensation, he's drawing his share of think pieces and criticism. At The New York Times, Jon Caramanica called Mendes an 'emotional do-gooder' with a debut single that is 'depressing and dull.'

'Taken together, these videos reveal him as the teenager he is, a 
not-quite-formed talent who thinks vibrato makes him sound serious and 
falsetto makes him sound irresistible,' Caramanica writes.

'But earnestness is just about the
 worst thing you can carry with you into a pop music career — earnest 
attitude is one thing, earnest presentation and production something 
else entirely. That misunderstanding hovers over “The Shawn Mendes EP” 
(Island), Mr. Mendes’s first release on a major label, and his 
highest-profile attempt at putting his tender voice to work on 
originals, not covers.'

Another Canadian teen pop idol, Justin Bieber, got his start with clips on YouTube

But whether any of that actually matters is debatable, as Jezebel writer Dodai Stewart argues in a post titled 'Teen Vine Star Is Number 1 on iTunes Thanks to Teen Girls.'

'Neither Mashable, the Times nor Business Insider note
 that Shawn's audience is mainly young women,' Stewart writes. 'A group that keeps on 
proving itself a force to be reckoned with, whether it's Twilight/Divergent/Hunger Games
 movie tickets, the One Direction juggernaut, or the fact that the album
 from 5 Seconds of Summer debuted at number 2 on the Billboard charts. 
Don't underestimate the power of a passionate pack of teenage girls.'
