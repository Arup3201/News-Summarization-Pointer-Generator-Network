With the festive party season now in full swing, Brits across the UK are glamming up in preparation for their Christmas parties.

And while budgets are tight we are heading to our local supermarkets to stock up on beauty buys at the same time as a pint of milk.

Savvy shoppers have been scouting out affordable fashion buys at the big supermarkets for years and now female shoppers can add cosmetics to their weekly shopping lists.

And demand is already so high that Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Asda have reported stocking up in the thousands.

With the party season in full swing, supermarkets are stocking up on beauty products in preparations

Morrisons is preparing by stocking its shelves with 3,500 sets of false eyelashes, 22,000 units of fake tan, as well as 62,000 units of hair dye and over 85,000 bottles of nail varnish in the weeks leading up to 25th December.

A Morrisons spokesperson said: 'The 
office Christmas party is an opportunity to let your hair down, enjoy an
evening with colleagues and end the work year on a bang.

'For many, it’s an occasion that requires a new outfit, lippie and a sun kissed glow.

'For
shoppers looking to make an extra effort at this year’s get together, 
we’ve ensured that our shelves are fully stocked with items that will 
leave you looking and feeling great on the night.'

Asda expects false eyelash sales to be up 60 per cent and mascara up a staggering 80 per cent.

Gemma Goldstraw, Asda's beauty expert said: 'The party season is upon us and we are stocking up to ensure our customers are fully prepped to take them from desk to dance floor without spending a fortune.

'Our beauty products guarantee to add
extra sparkle for less, including our best-selling Shimmer Me bronzers 
and Cheeky Tint for a sophisticated seasonal glow.

'Over the next couple of weeks we are
expecting sales of fake tan, lip gloss and Andrew Barton's S.O.S Last 
Another Day Dry Shampoo to rocket as our customers glam up and celebrate
over the holiday season.'

As for Sainsbury's it's hair styling products that are set to be a sell-out.

Asda are expecting to see between a 40-60 per cent increase in beauty product sales over the Christmas party season

Robert Cooke, Sainsbury’s Head of 
Buying for Electrical Goods, said: 'Electrical beauty product sales are 
rocketing as we approach party season, indicating that women are 
becoming increasingly savvy about achieving that sleek salon look at 
home and by-passing the cost of a salon visit.

'We expect sales to double over the coming weeks.

'Our best selling range this year is our exclusive Salon Collection hair care range from celebrity hair stylist, Phil Smith.

'Key products for the season are 
those that support the trend for “Big Hair”, the most popular will be 
the Multi Styler, Curling Wand and our Salon Collection Hair Dryer, all 
of which offer Salon performance at great value prices.'

A new £20 beauty pack dubbed ‘the supermarket facial’ is set to become the surprise hit of Christmas after 20,000 of them sold out within its first week of launch.

Now Sainsbury’s is ordering extra supplies to cope with the sudden demand for the pack to avoid shortages on the shelves in light of the sudden demand.

The Ultimate Pamper Kit, a tote bag containing a range of ‘pamper’ treatments, was launched exclusively by the supermarket a week ago but has already sold out, said the retail giant.

Makers Nip + Fab say the pack of facial scrub, hydrating mark, moisturiser, body wash, hand and eye cream replicate the effects of spa treatments costing around £200.

And in these budget conscious times, they are becoming this year’s ‘Tracy Island’ as the unexpected festive gift for this year.

Every year throws up a surprise best seller, such as Heston Blumenthal’s ‘hidden orange’ last year and, perhaps most famously, the Thunderbirds toy Tracy Island in 2000.

A spokeswoman for Nip + Fab said the pamper kit had been designed by beauty experts with ‘20 years experience’ but at a price that was within the range of most British women.

She said: 'Our customers are more beauty aware than ever before and we have seen a great response to the Nip + Fab pamper kit.

'While time savvy women want to look their best, it’s unrealistic due to pressures of families and work for them to spare a whole day at a spa for treatments such as facials.

'This treatment can be done in the luxury of your home and takes just 20 minutes. Women are more conscious than ever about looking after their skin but with facial treatments costing up to £200 it’s a luxury that most simply cannot justify.'

Celebrity beauty therapist Nuz Sugaa added: 'The premium ingredients in the Nip + Fab products will give the same desired results as many professional facials.

'The key elements of exfoliation, cleanse, hydration and protection are all covered in this clever kit.'

A spokeswoman for Sainsbury’s said: 'Our customers are more beauty aware than ever before and we have seen a great response to the what has been dubbed, ‘the supermarket facial.'
