A Utah dad fed up with his daughter’s preference for very short shorts decided to teach her a lesson by donning some Daisy Dukes of his own.

Scott Mackintosh was about to go on a family night out, but when he asked his daughter to kindly change into longer shorts and she refused, he took some scissors to an old pair of his own jeans.

The result was a revealing pair of cut-offs designed to show his daughter her shorts aren’t ‘as cute as she thinks.’

'In our family we have modesty guidelines': Scott Mackintosh's daughter wouldn't change out of her short shorts before a family outing, so the Utah dad slipped into a pair of his own

‘In our family we have pretty definite modesty guidelines,’ writes Mackintosh on his wife Becky’s blog.

One of those guidelines happens to be no short-shorts.

‘I’m a firm believer that the way we dress sends messages about us, and it influences the way we and others act,’ he writes.

Every  Monday, the Mackintoshes do something together ‘in an effort to try to spend time with just the family.’

Last Monday, they decided to go out to eat.

But as they were about to leave, Mackintosh’s teen daughter was resolute—she would not change out of her Daisy Dukes.

At first, the kids had their heads buried in their phones, Mackintosh said, and didn’t notice his revealing attire.

‘Why are you dressed like that?’ his daughter eventually asked when they were nearly at the restaurant. ‘Oh well, I don’t care.’

Dinner came and went without Mackintosh’s daughter breaking a sweat, so he decided to take things to the next level.

‘OK, let’s go miniature golfing,’ he said.

Again, the daughter wouldn’t let her embarrassment show.

Then, when they arrived at a local ice cream shop, she cracked.

‘As I pulled into a stall, my daughter said, “Uh, no! We are not going in!” I said “Let's go through the drive up.”’

Mackintosh, his wife, and their son went inside, but their daughter stayed in the car.

He’s not sure if the lesson sunk in, but Mackintosh said he’s comfortable with that.

‘There was no “Dad I get it,”’ he said. ‘But no matter if social media gets the story mixed up and twisted, my daughter will always know that her dad loves her and cares about her enough to make a fool out of himself.’
