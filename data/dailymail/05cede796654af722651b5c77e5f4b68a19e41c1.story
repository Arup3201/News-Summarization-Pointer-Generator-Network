The 6-year-old boy at the center of an international custody battle may soon be on his way back to the United States to live with his mother.

Jack Redmond, 6, went to live with his father Derek Redmond in Ireland nearly a year and a half ago after a court there ordered that his parents split custody in the country.

But mother Mary Redmond was forced to stay behind in the States since she violated the Irish courts original order to bring the child to Ireland and faced jail time for being in contempt of court.

At first, the U.S. court system ruled that Miss Redmond abide by the Irish decision, but on Wednesday overruled that and ordered Jack back to the states to live with his mother - for the time being.

Miss Redmond told the Chicago Tribune she cannot wait to get Jack 'back in my arms again' after their year and a half apart.

Miss
Redmond, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Orland Park, was told by 
U.S. State Department officials that the judge's order would be 
'immediately enforceable' and that they are working to expedite a U.S. 
passport for Jack.

She spoke to her son on Wednesday, the day the decision was made public, but hasn't told him about the good news yet.

'I wanted to say something, but he's only 6,' she said. 'A few days feels like an eternity to him.'

Forced to stay behind: Mary Redmond wasn't able to join her son in Ireland, since she would have been arrested for being in contempt of court

Jack was born in Illinois, but moved with his parents to Ireland when he was just 11 days old - making him a dual citizen and subject to Irish laws.

Though his parents never married, Derek Redmond filed for joint custody after their split.

Jack boarded a flight form O'Hare Airport to Ireland on July 10, after spending the day saying good bye to his mother - neither knowing when they were going to see each other again. Up until then, Jack had spent most of his life living with his mother in the United States.

'I'm shattered. I'm shattered. This is our home, and I don't want him to go,' Miss Redmond told CBS Chicago.

Miss Redmond became embroiled in the legal battle when she decided to leave her boyfriend, whom she described as mentally and physically abusive.

When Derek Redmond filed for joint custody of his son, Miss Redmond had initially accepted the Irish’s court ruling, but instead brought her son back to the U.S.

However, the judge’s order was for Mary Redmond to settle her affairs in Illinois and return to Ireland to live in the tiny village of Ballymurphy, and have her son attend a two-room schoolhouse.

Under the ruling, the custodial parent would change nightly. In other words, Jack was supposed to live with his mother one night, his father the next.

Because Miss Redmond defied the judge’s order by refusing to return to Ireland with her son, she was held in contempt, which means that Miss Redmond can be arrested the moment she sets foot on Irish soil.

That is why Jack’s grandmother, Peggy Redmond, accompanied him to Ireland instead.

Mary Redmond tearfully said she told her son, ‘He has to go to Ireland for a while. Grandma will be with him, and I told him if things don’t work out, I’m just going to have to go over there. I can’t be away from him.’

Derek Redmond’s attorney, David Schaffer, said that Mary Redmond brought this on herself by unlawfully keeping the child in the U.S.

‘He is so loved and so taken care of, and he belongs home in America, and I don't know why America isn't keeping him home,’ Peggy Redmond told NBC Chicago, before taking Jack - dressed in an American flag t-shirt and hat - through security.
