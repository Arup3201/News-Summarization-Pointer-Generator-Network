Immigration officers at a busy ferry terminal on an Indonesian island have issued a directive that is loud and clear – remain silent or else you will be kicked out of the country.

The new rule is putting foreign visitors at risk of being deported for talking or using a mobile phone in the immigration queue at the Batam Center International Ferry Terminal on the island of Batam.

Even speaking in a whisper could lead to passengers being turned around and put on the next ferry back to Singapore or Malaysia, according to a report in The Straits Times. 

Quiet: Visitors risk being deported if they make noise in the immigration queue at a Batam ferry terminal

The order went into effect this month when workers put up signs showing an image of a raised finger over a pair of lips.

Shushed visitors stand in silence as the quiet is broken only by the repeated thumping of passports or the odd passenger who strikes up a conversation without known the consequences. 

Guo Kai told The Straits Times he and a friend went to Batam, located off the south coast of Singapore, for a weekend getaway, but they were sent back to Singapore for speaking in the queue. 

He said an immigration officer had warned them to stop talking, but he had ‘no idea the penalty was going to be so harsh’.

‘I was there for a holiday – why couldn’t I open my mouth? I was just chit-chatting with my friend.’

About 50 Singaporeans have been turned back every week, according to a report on a website called The Real Singapore.

The one-hour ferry ride from Singapore to Batam is popular with day trippers or visitors on weekend breaks, costing about £24.

Batam Center Immigration Office chief Irwanto Suhaili defended the tactic, saying his officers need quiet to maintain order.

He said tourists would not be able to hear their names being called if visitors were allowed to make noise.

Ferry operators told the newspaper the same rules are in place at Sekupang, a city on Batam, but they are not strictly enforced.
