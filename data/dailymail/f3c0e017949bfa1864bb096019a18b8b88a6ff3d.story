Fake? Ikrom Yakubov has been caught with a clumsily forged driving licence

The credibility of a ‘KGB defector’ was in the spotlight last night after he was caught using a clumsily forged driving licence.

Ikrom Yakubov, 30, claimed asylum when he arrived in the UK in 2008, and later appeared on the BBC’s Newsnight as the first agent to defect from the Uzbekistan KGB.

But he now faces deportation, after a jury at Kingston Crown Court in London dismissed his elaborate story of obtaining a Portuguese licence legitimately during a top-secret mission.

Police checks with MI5 and MI6 failed to back up his claims.

Yakubov, who is unemployed, told the BBC’s Newsnight that  his grandfather founded the Uzbekistan KGB. He said he was in danger after criticising Islam Karimov, the country’s president, and that he had been tortured.

In the August 2009 interview, he claimed agents had broken his fingers, and he had been left with intestinal injuries after being badly beaten.

Yakubov, who lives in Tottenham, North London, told the Home Office he had worked for Uzbekistan’s national security agency the SNB – formerly the KGB – for a decade. He claimed he obtained the driving licence after being sent to Lisbon on an SNB mission, where he took lessons.

But when police pulled him over, they saw the hologram was incorrect, the typeface was not straight and the licence was issued before he took the test.

Claiming he had been convicted of treason in Uzbekistan, he told the jury: ‘This is a matter of life and death for me. I want to live in this country under a clear name.’

But they found him guilty of possessing a false identity document with intent, and he was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment, suspended for a year.
