Taxpayers have been landed with a £67,000 legal aid bill by paedophile Stuart Hazell – who put the family of Tia Sharp through a murder trial before eventually admitting the crime.

Despite overwhelming evidence, he initially denied killing the 12-year-old, but he changed his plea five days into the Old Bailey trial in May.

Hazell, the 37-year-old boyfriend of Tia's grandmother, Christine Bicknell, was jailed for a minimum of 38 years.

Details of his legal bill are likely to deepen the row surrounding taxpayer-funded defence costs. Last month it emerged that Mark Bridger, who murdered April Jones, received £150,000 from the taxpayer while dragging her distraught family through the courts.

The former slaughterman, 48, who kept child pornography and pictures of dead youngsters on his laptop, abducted and murdered five-year-old April in October 2012 before butchering and disposing of her body.

Two months earlier Hazell smothered Tia in the early hours after being left alone to babysit her while Miss Bicknell worked overnight at a care home.

He photographed the schoolgirl's naked dead body before wrapping it in sheets and bin liners and hiding it in the loft, where it was found a week later during the fourth police search of the house in New Addington, South London.

After the murder, he told Miss Bicknell that Tia had gone shopping in Croydon and had left without her phone. He later claimed she had died in an accident.

But Hazell's DNA was found on her clothes and her blood was found on his belt, leading the prosecution to accuse him of sexually assaulting Tia before her death.

In the weeks before the murder, he had repeatedly photographed and filmed the 12-year-old as she slept. Evidence of his obsession with child porn also undermined his story. Despite the mass of evidence, Hazell insisted he was innocent, forcing the case all the way to the Old Bailey and exposing Tia's family to the appalling details of what happened to her.

Following a Freedom of Information request, the Ministry of Justice revealed that Hazell's attempt to dodge justice had cost £67,341 in legal aid.

The ministry said anyone could apply for legal aid but it was 'determined' to bring down costs.

A spokesman added: 'At a time when everyone has to tighten their belts, we can't ignore the fact that legal aid is costing hardworking taxpayers too much. We are determined to tackle this.'
