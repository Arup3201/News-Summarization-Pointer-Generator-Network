Clothing sizes don’t always seem to make sense; a large in one shop can be a medium in another, but what if you could get a 3D-printed sweater that fits perfectly?

Appalatch, based in North Carolina, already makes woollen and cotton clothes and has now set up a Kickstarter campaign to buy a Stoll knitting machine - dubbed a ‘3D printer for clothes’ - that can knit custom-made clothes with minimal waste. 

It is a modern-day version of a traditional knitting loom or flat knitting machine and 'prints' clothes by reading measurements from software.

Clothing company Appalatch has set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund mass production of 100 per cent woollen sweaters made on a 3D printer. Its founders want the money to buy a Stoll knitting machine, pictured, that can take a customer's exact measurements to produce custom-made clothes

The Stoll knitting machine is dubbed a ‘3D printer for clothes’.

It is a modern-day version of a 
traditional knitting loom or flat knitting machine and 'prints' clothes 
by reading measurements from software.

To make a sweater, a customer sends the measurements to Appalatch online.

These are entered into the machine, which knits the custom-made clothes using wool.

The pieces are then sewn together and the finished item is posted.

Appalatch founders Mariano deGuzman and Grace Gouin said: ‘We’ve all been there. We shop only to be frustrated and disappointed.

'The sleeves are too short, the length is too long, or the body is too tight.

'Additionally, standard clothing fits one way for one brand and a completely different way for another brand.’

They want Appalatch to be the first company in the world to make 'custom-fit sweaters on a mass scale.'

The pair is asking for $50,000 (£31,000) to buy a Stoll Fully Fashion knitting machine. 

The sweaters will be sold in natural, navy, charcoal and camel, pictured top left to bottom right. They are made from Rambouillet wool. Appalatch's current range of sweaters start at $80 (£50). The 3D-printed designs are expected to cost a similar amount and should be shipped after the campaign closes on 6 December

Customers will then be able to send Appalatch their measurements online, including sleeve length, torso length, chest and waist circumference.

These measurements will be put into the Stoll machine and the device will ‘print’ a sweater based on the precise dimensions. The pieces will then be sewn together.

‘It’s a total game changer when it comes to making clothing’, said deGuzman.

‘Stoll's knitting machine is essentially a 3D printer for garments allowing us to create any knitted garment in any dimension imaginable.’

The machine can also reduce the amount of waste wool that traditional knitting machines and looms can create.

Appalatch is also working on cotton t-shirts for women, pictured left, and men, pictured right, that can also be 'printed' using the Stoll machine. The company claims the garments will be 'long lasting'

The sweaters will be sold in natural, navy, charcoal and camel for both men and women. They are made from 100 per cent fine 21.5 Micron Rambouillet wool from Montana sheep.

Appalatch is also working on cotton sweaters using materials from Texas and claims all of the garments are ‘long lasting.’

‘Ultimately we want you to buy less’ said Gouin, ‘but we want you to wear it for longer.’

Appalatch's current range of T-shirts start at around $60 (£37) and sweaters start at $80 (£50). The 3D-printed designs are expected to cost a similar amount, although larger sizes may cost extra.

Appalatch will also ship to the U.S, UK and other countries after the campaign ends on 6 December.
