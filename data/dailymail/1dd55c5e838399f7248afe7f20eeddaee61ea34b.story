Accused: Brian Regan, who played Terry Sullivan in Brookside, denies murder

A former star of Brookside was a getaway driver for a gang who shot a father-of-one dead, a court heard.

Brian Regan, 53, who played Terry Sullivan in Channel 4's Brookside for 14 years, is accused of driving alleged gunman Edward Heffey to and from the murder scene.

Nightclub bouncer Bahman Faraji, 44, was gunned down at close range outside a pub in Liverpool.

Former actor Regan told police after he had been arrested in connection with the murder: 'I done nothing wrong and I didn't do anything willingly.'

He also apparently added: 'I want to help you but I'll be shot.'

Regan claims he did not know Heffey was carrying a weapon when he drove him to the Aigburth suburb.

Mr Faraji, an Iranian known as Ben, was lured to the pub where he was shot in the face on February 24 this year by a series of phone calls, Liverpool Crown Court was told.

Regan is standing trial alongside Heffey, 40, Lee Dodson, 42, and Simon Smart, 32.

Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, told the jury: 'Edward Heffey was the gunman who 
actually shot the victim, and Brian Regan, by arrangement with Lee 
Dodson, drove Heffey to and from the scene of the shooting, fully aware 
of the purpose of Heffey's trip.'

A man approached Mr Faraji and asked: 'Are you Ben?', the prosecutor said.

He added: 'Mr Faraji nodded and the 
man raised what appeared to be a shortened double-barrelled shotgun and 
fired it directly into Mr Faraji's face.

'There was a cloud of smoke and Mr 
Faraji fell to the ground. The gunman fled the scene on foot and 
witnesses saw him carrying a gun under his arm.

'He then got into a waiting vehicle driven by Brian Regan.'

Mr Faraji died instantly, a post mortem examination found.

Detectives launched a murder investigation and began a hunt for the getaway car.

The following day police stop-checked
a Ford Escort estate in Liverpool city centre and inside the vehicle 
were Regan and his girlfriend Christine Line.

Regan gave a witness statement saying the car belonged to a friend but he had the use of it, Mr Cummings said.

'He said he'd been using the car the 
previous evening but he had not been in the area where the murder took 
place,' the prosecutor added.

'Christine Line's witness statement said broadly the same thing but there were some significant differences,' he added.

Police became suspicious and both were arrested.

Liverpool-based Brookside began on Channel 4's launch night in November 1982 and ran for 21 years until November 2003.

Regan joined the soap from episode 
six and his Terry Sullivan character was at the centre of some of 
Brookside Close's most dramatic storylines until his final appearance in
1997.

The soap opera, noted for confronting
gritty issues, turned scores of actors into household names, including 
Sue Johnson, Amanda Burton and Anna Friel.

All the men deny murder. Regan and his girlfriend also deny perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues today.
