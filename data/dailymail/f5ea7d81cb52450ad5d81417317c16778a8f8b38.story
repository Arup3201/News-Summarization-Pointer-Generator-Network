Andros Townsend scored one and set up the other as Tottenham cruised to victory in Greece.

The Spurs star celebrated another England call-up with the opening goal from the penalty spot after he was brought down in the box.

Townsend turned provider just before the break when his teasing cross was nodded in by goal machine Harry Kane to give them breathing space.

Jeronimo Barrales pulled one back from the spot late on to ensure a nervy finish after Federico Fazio saw red for brining down the Asteras substitute.

Tottenham Hotspur (4-2-3-1)

Micel Vorm 6

Gave Tottenham the occasional scare and relied on the post, but showed potential. Unlucky to concede the penalty.

Eric Dier 6

When Asteras threatened, Dier was there to diffuse the situation. Kept busy by the opposition.

Federico Fazio 5 

A bit too shaky in the second half as Asteras threatened to get into the game. Unlucky to be sent off in the dying moments for foul in the area.

Jan Vertonghen 6

 Captained the side well for the majority of the match but his Tottenham team looked unorganised during a hectic second half.

Ben Davies 5

A mistake almost punished Tottenham in the first half, and looked a little erratic at times when the opposition ran at him. 

Benjamin Stambouli 6 

Not the most convincing of displays but helped Tottenham start attacks and tracked back when needed.

Moussa Dembele 6

Cool and composed in possession while trying to calm Tottenham down when Asteras attacked. 

Erik Lamela 6  

Substituted at half time after a tame swerving shot and with Stoke match in mind. Not bad but not impressive enough for a £30m player.

Andros Townsend 8

Plenty of energy and had a point to prove. Did so with a cool penalty and a sublime cross for Kane’s headed goal.

Christian Eriksen 6

Did well in attack but was substituted in the second half.

Harry Kane 7

Another goal after another start. A constant threat making runs, and in the right place at the right time for his header.

MOTM - Townsend 8

Soldado 6, 46

Came on with 45 minutes to prove why he’s preferred to Kane, but little went his way.

Mason 6, 63

The game was settled when he was introduced but helped Tottenham see out the win.

Paulinho N/A, 77

Mauricio Pochettino 6

Sealed the win the first half but Asteras looked far too dangerous against Tottenham in the second. 

Asteras Tripolis (4-2-3-1): Kosicky 5; Lluy 5, Sankare 6, Panteliadis 5, Zisopoulos 6; Usero 6, Munafo 5 (Gianniotas 6, 81); Mazza 6, Rolle 5, Tsokanis 6 (Badibanga 6, 60); Parra 6 (Barrales, 84). 

Referee: Javier Estrada (ESP) 6 

Finally bowed to pressure from home crowd at the end but overall let the game flow.
