The devastated family of a 29-year-old Australian woman who died after undergoing ‘simple’ cosmetic surgery in Mexico are desperately trying to find what happened to their ‘beautiful and gracious’ loved one.

Evita Nicole Sarmonikas was admitted to a hospital in Mexicali, the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California, on March 20 while on holiday with her boyfriend. She died on the same day, after reportedly suffering a heart attack.

Her distraught family are at a loss to understand why she could not be saved. They highlight how Australian Medical advice shows that ‘even in the case of cardiac arrest a healthy young body can often be brought back to life when surrounded by a fully equipped hospital and a competent medical team’.

Ms Sarmonikas’s family has set up a Facebook page in tribute to the ‘perfect and whole soul’ and to also help fundraise up to $20,000, which is needed to bring her body back home to Australia.

They have also urged other woman not to 'risk death to improve on perfection'.

Gold Coast woman Evita Nicole Sarmonikas has died in a Mexican hospital after undergoing surgery 

‘The autopsy showed Eva went into cardiac arrest following surgery. The hospitals' only response was to cling to their waiver, removing themselves from any liability,’ a family member wrote on the Facebook group.

‘There have been no answers and their only offer of “cooperation” was an urgency to return her to us in the form of ashes. The Australian Embassy has strongly advised we do not allow this to happen.’

Ms Sarmonikas’s family have been advised to travel to Mexico as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy – not carried out by the hospital where she died – and to bring her home.

They say she 'did not have travel insurance and we were never prepared for a situation of this magnitude'.

‘Evita as we knew her on earth would be devastated at the amount of attention she is receiving at the moment, as she was extremely private and worked very hard to never be a burden on anybody,’ her family wrote.

‘However the abundance of love that we all hold for her is propelling the action that needs to be taken before she be laid to rest, and she deserves that.’

A Facebook tribute page has been set up for Evita to share advice and support and to help fundraise to bring her body home to Australia 

One friend on Facebook described Eva as a 'shining light in the dark and unforgiving world' 

Her family are also asking for help in gaining legal and medical representation as advised by The Australian Embassy.

Ms Sarmonikas’s family have not said what procedure Evita was undergoing before she died but they explained: ‘As beautiful as Evita was inside and out. She was still filled with certain inadequacies. As almost every woman on earth does.’

‘Her perfect and whole soul was not strong enough in light of a world that constantly bombarded her with an urgency to demand more from herself and her body,’ they explained.

‘She never demanded anything from anybody, but was always out giving her people. These near perfect graphic comparisons our young women are bombarded with from get go are too much for innocent hearts to battle, and the consequences are fatal when not conducted by adequate professionals.

‘These doctors promised her more perfection to fill an emptiness that began developing early in our childhood. This emptiness further expanded with traumatic experiences in her adult life and the constant social boarding of a false beauty illusion,’ they Facebook post continued.

Her sister Andrea has urged others not too risk their lives in the pursuit of what they perceive as beauty.

‘This was not the way to go home, no woman should risk death to improve on perfection,’ they said.

‘Tomorrow morning when you look in the mirror say to yourself "I am enough, I am worthy, I am perfect just the way I am".

‘Don't listen to a world that is hungry to fill your insecurities with poison. Stop feeding an industry that hates humans, especially women in the natural state and their perfect birth bodies. Do it for Eva, do it for you.’ 

Tributes have poured in for the 29-year-old. One friend wrote 'she was such a gorgeous girl physically and emotionally' 

Friends have promised to help bring Evita,  'a truly beautiful soul', home anyway they can 

There has been an outpouring of love and messages of condolences on the page set up to remember Ms Sarmonikas.

Ashleigh Carvell said: 'So sad she was such a gorgeous girl physically and emotionally. She seemed to be so confident in herself. Such a sad thing to happen my heart aches for u all. My deepest condolences.'

Sugah Kimba wrote: 'She is a beautiful soul!!! Eva is the type of person to make the world a little more beautiful!!!! That's just who she was!!!'

Sasha RPaki said: 'How do you improve on perfection? Eva was perfect, just as God made her and no man should ever have adulterated His masterpiece. The world is poorer for having lost her.'

'This news is devastating! All my memories of Eva, Sarah and I as little girls playing in the street have flooded back! I remember bumping into her a few years back and was amazed by her beauty.. Inside and out! I'm so sorry for your loss, it's always the good ones that are taken too soon!,' Elise O'Donnell wrote.

Helen Pearce added: 'Eva was a shining light in this dark and unforgiving world. Beautiful inside and out, gracious, sensitive, caring and giving, who lived by her moto of laugh, live, love. Eva you will be so sadly missed.'
