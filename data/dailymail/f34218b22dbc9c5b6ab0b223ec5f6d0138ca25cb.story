A student has been told he can keep a £3,600 haul of goods from Amazon including a television and tablet computer after he was sent them because of a computer glitch.

Christmas came early for Robert Quinn, 22, when he started receiving parcels which appeared to have been destined to be returned to the online retailer, only to arrive at his family home in Bromley, south London.

In total 51 packages addressed to Mr Quinn have been sent to his parents' house ranging from a £150 baby buggy to a £50 portable heater - and they keep coming.

The packages started arriving a week ago, and the most recent arrivals yesterday included a £165 computer processor. 

He also received a book on neurological physiotherapy, a pirate outfit and an £18.98 Lego fire truck, as well as the £889 55-inch Samsung 3D television and the 12 inch Galaxy Pro, which retails on the site for £338.

Other parcels contained larger items such as a single bed, a bookcase and a chest of drawers. 

And there has been a £120 laptop, a baby buggy, a Sony PSP console, a £90 Waterman pen, a £170 electric wine cooler, a Lotus car user manual, CDs, DVDs and books.

Mr Quinn, 22, who is currently away at the University of Liverpool where he studies engineering, believes a computer glitch meant the goods were sent to him, instead of a returns depot as the items had been packaged up with returns labels.

His haul remains at his family home but sensibly, he took the pen back to Liverpool for his studies.

He said: 'At first I phoned up Amazon and they said that people must be "gifting" them to me, but there’s no way that’s happening because I don’t know any of these people.

'I was worried that people were losing out on their stuff so I phone Amazon again and said I’m happy to accept these gifts if they are footing the cost, but I’m not happy if these people are going to lose out. But Amazon said "it’s on us". 

'I don’t think they’ve rectified the problem because I’m still getting more stuff.'

Some of the gifts he plans to give as presents to his family, but may sell the £340 tablet despite his father having a keen eye on it.

'My brother wants the Dolce and Gabbana aftershave and my dad wants the Galaxy tablet,' he said.

'My brother can get the aftershave but I’m not sure my dad can have that tablet for free.

'My mum wants the leaf blower, she can have that. The rest I might sell back on Amazon.'

The keen inventor is planning to give some of the items away to charity and sell the rest to fund an 'innovative' new cannabis grinder he is designing.

He said: 'I should have about £1,600 to play with this summer and I might take my girlfriend to Bruges.

'And at the moment I’m working on an electrical cannabis grinder. I’m thinking about getting a patent on it.'  

Lucky: The goods include a 55-inch Samsung television, similar to this model, and a tablet computer

A spokesman for Amazon told MailOnline: 'This matter has now been resolved and I can confirm that on this occasion the customer has been informed that he can keep the items that were delivered.' 

Amazon.co.uk, and many of the sellers who run their businesses through the website, offer returns for most items within 30 days of receipt of delivery, although this has been extended for the Christmas period. 

Many buyers are given a label to print and fix to their item before posting it back to the retailer. 

Last week the retailer experienced a record-breaking Black Friday when it sold 5.5million items at a rate of 64 purchases a second. 

It has also hired 13,000 extra staff to deal with pre-Christmas demand.
