The vegan strip club where Cory Booker's Twitter friend works has jumped on their new-found publicity by adding a new sandwich to their menu.

Casa Diablo has added the veggie 'Booker Burger' to their menu of meat-free offerings, noting how they add extra mayo to the sandwich 'since he's the 'mayo'-r of Newark'.

The newfound connection between Booker, who is running to fill New Jersey's empty Senate seat, and the unique strip club on the other side of the country in Portland, Oregon was revealed when Buzzfeed released the private conversation between the 44-year-old Democrat and a stripper.

The woman, Lynsie Lee, sent the site a screen grab of their virtual flirtations on Wednesday and both parties have been downplaying their relationship as innocent.

That hasn't stopped the strip club from seizing the opportunity to cash in on the publicity.

The New York Post reports that the dinner special listed outside the club on Thursday read 'Booker Burger, with a side of Lynsie Lee thighs!'

The vegan approach to adult entertainment means that the performers and patrons are asked not to wear fur, leather, or any animal products inside or on stage.

The rest of their menu is similarly tongue-in-cheek as they sell 'drunk bread' which is described as 'whatever bread we have toasted into Garlic Bread because you're drunk & need cheap food'.

Unique: Johnny Diablo Zukle is the owner of the vegan strip club where Lee works

Rules: Though Lee is not a vegan herself, the strip club takes an ethical stance against animal abuse

Johnny Diablo, the owner of the strip club, was not the only one who knew that business would be booming following the political publicity.

'If you come to see me at @CasaDiablo tonight, bring your wallets. I'm prime meat for the next couple of days! ;)' she wrote to her thousands of new Twitter followers.

She has given a number of interviews since releasing the screen shot, each time defending the Newark mayor and admitting that she has a crush on him.

''I flirted with him publically, as I do with a lot of people,' Lee said about Booker.

'There was nothing secret or sexy about it,' she told The Associated Press, calling their exchange G-rated.

The two started conversing online after they both appeared in a documentary about Twitter- the social media site that Booker has been using actively for much of his career to communicate with constituents and fans like Lee.

She sent him a public message saying that the West Coast loved the New Jersey politician, and he responded in a private message, writing: 'and the East Coast love you and by the East Coast, I mean me.'

'Well now I'm blushing :),' she wrote.

'Itâ€™s only fair,' Booker responded.

After dismissing the exchange during a press conference on Thursday, Booker said that the unusual food choices at the strip club is the real root of the public fascination over the story.

'I really think it's because the press corps is obsessed with vegan living,' he said.
