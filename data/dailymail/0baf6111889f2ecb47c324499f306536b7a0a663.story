After eight laborious rounds, Tyson Fury belted out his own unique rendition of Walking in Memphis, a performance that proved more entertaining than the preceding action in the same ring.

Fury was far from his best during a stoppage victory over Germany-based Romanian Christian Hammer who was pulled out by his corner two thirds of the way through the scheduled 12 rounds.

As workman-like a performance as it was, Fury remains on course for a shot at the world’s finest heavyweight Wladimir Klitschko later this year.

Fury's singing provided more entertainment than the eight rounds he spent fighting Hammer

The 6ft 9in giant risked his mandatory challenger status by taking on Hammer at London’s O2 Arena but never looked troubled by the smaller man.

Having boxed beautifully for 10 rounds against Dereck Chisora last November, Fury delivered only in spells on Saturday night.

When he kept Hammer at range, the visitor was left bewildered and with only a looping, inaccurate overhand right in response.

Tyson made reasonably light work of Hammer, but adopted a cautious approach throughout

With so much on the line, Fury was not going to be caught with a lucky punch and his cautious style hardly made this a barnstormer.

He did have Hammer on the canvas in the fifth session but the visitor managed to see out another three sessions before his corner took mercy.

Fury must now wait to see if Klitschko can overcome Bryant Jennings in New York next month before the fight he craves can be made.
