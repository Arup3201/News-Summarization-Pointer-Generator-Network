Mark Bridger, 48, demanded thousands of pounds in compensation after he was attacked by a fellow prisoner, but has now been told he will get nothing

The killer of schoolgirl April Jones was today refused compensation after being slashed across the face by another prisoner.

Paedophile Mark Bridger, 48, was also told that his request to move to another jail following the attack has also been rejected.

Bridger is serving life at for kidnapping and murdering April, five, and has complained of threats and attacks by inmates at the maximum security prison where he is being held.

He was slashed across the face with a blade by fellow murderer in July last year which left him needing hospital treatment and caused a scar across his face.

Bridger claimed he was fearing for his life and demanded a move from HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, and thousands of pounds in compensation for the attack.

But the family of murdered schoolgirl April Jones were today told his demands had been refused by the Ministry of Justice and he would not be receiving any money.

In a short statement April’s parents Coral and Paul Jones said: 'Mark Bridger is not moving to a new jail. He is not getting any money for his cut on his face.'

Father-of-six Bridger snatched April near her home in Machynlleth, Powys, in October 2012 and was given a whole-life sentence following a murder trial at Mold Crown Court in May last year.

The five-year-old’s body has never been found - despite the largest search in British police history.

Bridger was sent to the notorious HMP Wakefield, which has been nicknamed 'Monster Mansion', which is believed to house the likes of Stuart Hazell, who murdered schoolgirl Tia Sharpe, and Charles Bronson.

Bridger was attacked and slashed across the face by Juvinai Ferreira, 22, an inmate who is serving a life sentence for murder.

Bridger needed hospital treatment for a face wound but was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched up.

April’s mother Coral said at the time: 'I hope he’s threatened every day for the rest of his life. Every day I’m suffering - I’ve got a lifetime of hell to live through.

'Him wanting to be moved is disgusting. He did the crime, now he’s got to do the time.'

In January, Bridger abandoned an appeal against his sentence just 11 days before the hearing.

He will now die behind bars after judges rejected a European ruling that no-parole terms breached human rights.

HMP Wakefield, also known as Monster Mansion, is home to some of Britain's most notorious inmates, and is thought to contain Stuart Hazell, the killer of Tia Sharpe, and Charles Bronson
