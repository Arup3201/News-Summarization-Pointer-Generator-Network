Cases of lung cancer in Beijing have doubled in the past decade with Chinese officials blaming the rise on smoking.

However the number of smokers in Beijing has fallen in recent years while air pollution soared by 30 per cent in the first few months of 2013, raising fears that the increase could be due to the smog.

Wang Huiyao, who heads the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalisation think tank, said: 'How shocking! This number doesn’t even include the floating population.

Rates of lung cancer have doubled in Beijing in the last decade, and while officials blame smoking, many fear that the city's smog is to blame

'We must keep our environment from getting worse–no matter what. In the past 10 years, the number of smokers and smoking areas have decreased; why have lung cancer rates increased so much?'

Users of Chinese social networking site Weibo agreed. One user, Jingyan_melody commented: 'The spike in lung cancer is clearly due to environmental pollution, yet they blame it on smoking.

'The number of people who smoke has decreased, especially while in public.'

The figures from the official Xinhua news
 agency showed the number of lung cancer patients per 100,000 people 
went from 39.56 in 2002 to 63.09 by 2011.

The news comes a week after an 
eight-year-old girl was diagnosed with lung cancer which doctors blamed 
on the country's dire air quality.

The World Health Organisation estimates that around 200,000 people died last year as a result of cancer caused by bad air, and that around half of cases were in China or East Asia.

Pollution in the developing nation has become so bad thanks to China having the world's largest manufacturing sector coupled with the world's largest population.

Around 100million people in China are employed in factories of some kind, more than 10 times the number in the US, and China accounts for roughly 20 per cent of the world's industrial output.

China's huge industrial sector, which employs around 100million people, has gone unregulated for years as the country drives for growth meaning the air has become polluted

Decades of industrial growth have been fuelled by weak government regulation which has allowed factories to be built quickly, cheaply, and with little concern for the environmental impact.

As a result smog levels in Beijing are now so bad that experts have warned of a national security threat because CCTV cameras are unable to see through the haze.

Measures are being being passed to tackle the problem as new government officials fear a backlash from the wealthy middle-class, but past laws have simply been ignored as the country pursues growth at all costs.

China's population now stands at 1.4billion, up from just 563million in the mid-1950s, and accounts for roughly one in five people on the planet.

That surge has meant huge demand for concrete, glass and steel to build new cities with. These very heavy industries are among the most polluting.

China's population boom, rising from 563million in 1950s to 1.4billion this year, means the country is the world's largest consumer of coal which fuels its power stations

China is also the world's biggest consumer of coal, and around half of all coal used next year is expected to be burned in the country either in power stations or by people heating their homes.

The government said pollution levels would be cut by slowing the growth of coal consumption so that its share of China's energy sources fell to 65 percent by 2017.

Last month, choking smog forced Chinese authorities to shut down one of the country's largest cities.

The dense pollution in Harbin - a city of more than 10 million people – meant that visibility was reduced to less than 10 metres.

The smog forced schools to suspend classes, caused snarling traffic and closed the airport, in what was the country's first major air pollution crisis of the winter.

The cold weather typically brings the worst air pollution to northern China because of a combination of weather conditions and an increase in the burning of coal for homes and municipal heating systems.

While smoking in China is still a huge problem, with 320million people thought to be addicted, it has actually declined in recent years while air pollution has soared

China is also the world's largest consumer of cigarettes, with an estimated 320million people lighting up every year,  more than than the entire population of the United States, and accounting for one in four of the world's smokers.

A million people are thought to die every year from tobacco-related illnesses in China, with most of them being from lung infections including tuberculosis and lung cancer.

However, in the last 14 years smoking in China has actually fallen from 63 per cent in 1996, to 54 per cent in 2010.

The vast majority of those are elderly men, with just 2 per cent of Chinese women being addicted.

In Beijing, which has some of the worst air quality in the country, just 15 per cent of people smoke.

While 320million Chinese smoke, the rate has fallen steadily since 1996
