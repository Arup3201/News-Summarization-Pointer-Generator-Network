A day after he was heckled by new New York Police Department officers at an academy graduation ceremony, the city's mayor sat down with union heads in a bid to clear the air between the two sides.

Mayor Bill de Blasio was joined by Police Commissioner William Bratton on Tuesday afternoon at the Police Academy in Queens for the private meeting with union heads.

De Blasio had requested the meeting with the heads of all five police unions following several displays of disrespect against him by officers in the wake of the shooting deaths of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

A day after he was heckled by new New York Police Department officers at an academy graduation ceremony, Mayor de Blasio sat down with union heads in a bid to clear the air between the two sides

A rift between de Blasio and much of the NYPD's rank and file has widened recently following the two murders on December 20 and City Hall's response to protests over police conduct.

Union leaders have blamed the mayor for fostering an anti-NYPD atmosphere and said it contributed to the officers' deaths.

Present was one of the mayor's harshest critics Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association chief Pat Lynch whose son, Kevin, graduated from the academy on Monday.

He has accused de Blasio of having 'blood on his hands' over the two deaths at the hands of Ismaaiyl Brinsley.

The Democratic mayor was elected last year on promises of keeping crime low while reforming the NYPD. Meanwhile, police unions have been seeking new contracts.

Another union leader, Captains Endowment Association President Roy Richter, has informed officers not to turn their backs on the mayor at the upcoming funeral of Officer Liu.

'In this forum the appropriate protest is not a sign or turning away from mourners, or people the family has asked to speak, but rather cold, steely silence,' he wrote in a memo to his membership on Tuesday.

Three days ago, dozens of police officers showed their disdain for de Blasio byturning their backs to a video monitor as the Mayor spoke at the funeral of Liu's partner, Rafael Ramos.

Richter says there can be no repeat of this at Liu's wake and funeral this weekend, reports the New York Daily News.

'In the coming days and weeks you will be looked upon by many for guidance, leadership and advice at a time when many of our peers and officers under our care are deeply angry,' he wrote.

'Unfortunately, but understandably, this anger provided visual displays of back-turning at the funeral of Police Officer Ramos that caused pain for his loved ones.'

NYPD officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department

De Blasio angered police by expressing sympathy for protesters demonstrating against a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to prosecute a white cop for killing Eric Garner with a chokehold. 

NYPD officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department.

An unnamed supervisor told the New York Post on Monday that his officers are writing significantly fewer summonses and 'probably only making arrests when they have to - like when a store catches a shoplifter.'

'I'm not writing any summonses. Do you think I'm going to stand there so someone can shoot me or hit me in the head with an ax?' one cop told the Post. 

'I'm concerned about my safety. I want to go to home to my wife and kids.'

A union mandate requiring that two patrol cars respond to all police calls – introduced following the shootings of Officers Ramos and Liu – has also contributed to slower response times to non-emergencies.

The PBA's directive is creating a manpower shortage that is delaying response times to crimes such as burglaries and car crashes to as much as four hours, according to the paper. 

Mayor de Blasio was booed on Monday by the newest members of the NYPD as he delivered a speech at the academy graduation ceremony.

Several boos could be heard at Madison Square Garden as de Blasio took the podium in front of 884 newly-minted cops.

Mayor de Blasio ignored the boos and thanked the new recruits for their service to the city of New York

At least one cadet could be heard shouting 'traitor!'

Then, when de Blasio remarked that the new officers would be confronted with problems they didn't make, someone from the crowd shouted, 'You created them!' The heckler was met with applause and cheering. 

The incident shows that mistrust has taken hold even among the NYPD's newest officers.

On Saturday, hundreds of cops turned their backs on de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, one of two NYPD cops gunned down by a fanatic who was enraged about recent police brutality cases - including the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner. 

The Mayor has come in for sharp criticism from the police union after expressing sympathy for protesters who took to the streets in the wake of a grand jury's failure to indict the NYPD cop who allegedly put Garner in a chokehold.

In a speech following the grand jury decision, de Blasio, whose children are half-black, recounted how he told his teenage son Dante how to deal with the police and that he might be discriminated against by the NYPD.  

Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said de Blasio had 'blood on his hands' in the death of Ramos and his partner Officer Wenjian Liu, who were assassinated on December 20 as they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn.

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said on Sunday that the strife between de Blasio and the rank-and-file officers is likely to last 'for some time.'

City Hall and the Patrolman's Benevolent Association are in the midst of rancorous contract negotiations that are set to go to arbitration - further exacerbating the strife. 

The Mayor and Lynch - his most outspoken critic - came face-to-face on Monday when they posed together for a photo for an award that the PBA gives out for the top squad sergeant from the graduating class. 

Lynch's son Kevin is among the graduating class.
