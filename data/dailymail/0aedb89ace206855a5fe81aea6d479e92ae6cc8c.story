Simone Barton-Shaw, 12, was banned from wearing her leopard skin coat by Ash Green School, Coventry

A father pulled his two daughters out of school after one was told she wasn't allowed to wear a leopard print coat.

Simon Denulder, 35, bought the jacket so his daughter, Simone Barton-Shaw, would be easily seen by cars as she walked home on dark evenings.

But the 12-year-old was told off when she arrived at Ash Green School, in Coventry, and was warned she could only return in black or grey clothes.

The father-of-two immediately withdrew Simone and her 15-year-old sister, Kelsey, from the school which is rated as satisfactory by Oftsed.

Mr Denulder said: 'My daughter has got a leopard print coat that keeps her dry and warm.

'The
school want all the pupils to have a dark coloured coat, but when 
children are walking home from school in the dark, it would be better 
for them to wear more visible clothing.

'Simone's coat isn't brightly
coloured, it just makes her easier for drivers to spot in the evenings.
It's just the same as any other coat - it's just that it's leopard 
print.

'What's the difference? It's not offensive.'

The school, which caters for 620 pupils aged between 11 and 16, claims the coat 'did not conform' to it's 'strict dress code'.

Principal Andrew Clay insists its uniform rules are an important aspect of school life, adding: 'The code is agreed by the Governing Body of the school.

Simon Denulder banned his daughters Kelsey, 15, and Simone, 12, (pictured with their mother Kelly Shaw) from school after the latter was told she couldn't wear the coat

'All parents and students were informed of the code in the summer.

Was father right to pull both daughters out of school after one was banned from wearing leopard print coat?

'AGS students wear their uniform with pride and it is integral to the strong work ethic and successful ethos of the school.

'Mr Denulder was informed recently that a coat worn to school was inappropriate. This is because it did not conform to the school dress code.

'After a meeting arranged to hear his concerns and to make the school's position clear Mr Denulder removed both of his children from the school of his own volition.

'His children have not been excluded from school or informally asked to stay away. Neither would be an appropriate response.

Simone was told she must return to school in black or grey clothes which are in keeping with school rules

Ash Green School in Coventry said the coat was 'inappropriate' and 'did not conform to the school's strict dress code'

'We would hope that Mr Denulder will decide to send his children back to a highly successful school.'

After discussing the matter last week Mr Denulder agreed to return older daughter Kelsey to school ahead of her GCSEs, but not until after half term.Â 

He added: 'I'm still trying to find somewhere else for Simone to go.

'Kelsey is going back after half term - we don't want to move her at the moment because she's in the middle of her GCSEs.'
