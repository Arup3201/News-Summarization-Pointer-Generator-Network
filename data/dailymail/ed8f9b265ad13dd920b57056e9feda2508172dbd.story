Former  Red Sox and  Phillies player Curt Schilling on Tuesday explained why he had exposed cyber bullies who posted sexually-explicit comments about his daughter on Twitter.

The 48-year-old ESPN analyst told GMA that the vile tweets about 17-year-old Gabby were 'a conscious decision to say evil stuff'.

The baseball legend had shared a proud tweet last week about his only daughter joining as a pitcher for Salve Regina University's softball team - but it was met with crude, sexual remarks.

Schilling named two of the culprits including Adam Nagel, a student and DJ at Brookdale Community College in New Jersey, who since has been suspended from school and faces a conduct hearing, according to Boston.com.

Nagel had all but wiped his online presence on Tuesday after he was revealed as one of the culprits of the trolling.

However a still-active Tumblr account belonging to Nagel revealed a stream of graphic sexual photos, pictures of marijuana and racist images.

The second troll that Schilling named is Sean MacDonald, a part-time, ticket-seller for the New York Yankees and former vice president of the Theta Xi fraternity at Montclair State University, who recently graduated from the school.

He was fired from his job with the Yankees, which he held since January, according to NJ.com.

Nagel also shared these images on his Tumblr account - but had vanished online on Tuesday after it was revealed he had been trolling a 17-year-old girl 

Schilling wrote a blog post commenting on the astounding ignorance and lack of morals following the incident, and also shared the vile tweets by the trolls. 

He said on Tuesday: 'I'll do everything not to embarrass her but I'll never not protect her.' 

His daughter Gabby, who appeared with her father in the interview, added: 'No one should be able to get away with saying those things to a father about his daughter.'  

In what was meant to be an incredibly proud day for the family, quickly went sour on February 25 with vile responses to the baseball legend's original tweet.

Schilling wrote on his blog post: 'And tweets with the word rape, bloody underwear and pretty much every other vulgar and defiling word you could likely fathom began to follow.'

Mr Schilling told GMA on Tuesday: 'Anybody that reads those tweets and says it's just a joke, they are not fathers of kids.'

He continued: 'I grew up in a locker room and never in my life have I uttered the words these guys were using.'

MacDonald who went by Twitter handle @primetime227 along with Nagel, user @Nagels_Bagels, were among those who shared offensive tweets. Both of their social media accounts have since been deleted (above Schilling names MacDonald and Nagel in his 38 Pitches blog post)

Tweets initially came from some people wanting to date Gabby once she was on campus, but soon turned offensive with many sexually-crude comments about the 17-year-old's body.

MacDonald, who went by Twitter handle @primetime227, along with Nagel, user @Nagels_Bagels, were among those who shared offensive tweets.

Both of their social media accounts have since been deleted.

Brookdale Community College released a statement giving their sincerest apologies to Gabby and said the Twitter comments posted by the student were unacceptable.

The school, said: '[The Twitter comments] clearly violate the standards of conduct that are expected of all Brookdale students.

'The student has been summarily suspended and will be scheduled for a conduct hearing where further disciplinary action will be taken. The Brookdale Police are actively investigating this matter.'

Schilling said that once the tweets started being posted, Gabby came to him 'beyond upset' after she started to receive personal messages from guys. He responded saying it is never okay for a man to talk about a woman in that way.

'If I was a deranged protective dad I could have been face to face with any of these people in less than four hours,' wrote Schilling. 

'I know every one of their names, their parents, where they go to school, what they do, what team they are on, their positions, stats, all of it.'

He said that the guys behind the bullying are not thugs or 'kids who had it rough', but they are 'pretty much' all white, affluent, college-attending children.

Following the incident, he said a few of the other trolls wrote to him apologizing after they were suspended from their college sports' teams, and two others have since deleted their Twitter accounts.

One Twitter user, Mike Kelly from Utah, wrote to Schilling asking if he felt good to have gotten kids 'kicked off' their sports teams.

Schilling responded: 'Not sure I can tell you how good. Being able to defend my daughter. Someday when you understand honor, integrity, you'll get it.' 

In his protective-father mode, he also wrote as a reminder to those who went after his daughter that 'the real world has consequences' and that 'we're at a point now where you better be sure who you're going after'.

At the end of his post he said that he apologized to Gabby, who he said might be embarrassed by it all, but  like any dad, he just wants her to head to college knowing how much he loves her.

He wrote: 'I love you more than life itself and there is nothing I would not do to protect you.'
