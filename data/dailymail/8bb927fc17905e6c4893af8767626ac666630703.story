U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy presented her credentials to Japan's emperor this morning, traveling by horse-drawn carriage into the Imperial Palace in downtown Tokyo.

Hundreds of onlookers snapped pictures and waved as Kennedy, the 55-year-old daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy, waved back from inside the carriage.

In an unusual move, national broadcaster NHK showed Kennedy's arrival at the Imperial Palace live, following the entourage from the air once it entered the palace gates.

Renowned: Caroline Kennedy had made a late start to a political career for which her family is renowned

It is customary for a newly arrived ambassador to meet with Emperor Akihito to present credentials.

The procession was accompanied by palace officials in European-style ceremonial costumes, including a footman in breaches, led by a horseman astride a white horse.

Kennedy was appointed ambassador after helping President Barack Obama's re-election campaign.

She is the first woman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan, the United States' fourth-largest trading partner and home to the Navy's 7th Fleet and 50,000 American troops.

Her close ties to Obama come from playing a pivotal role during the Democratic presidential primaries in 2008 by endorsing him when Hillary Clinton was the lead candidate

Kennedy arrived in Tokyo on Friday to take up the position bringing one important strength: She has the ear of the American president.

'I bring greetings from President Obama,' she said in a short statement after getting off the plane with her husband Edwin Schlossberg at Narita airport on Friday.

Japan she will work closely with Barack Obama to tackle some urgent U.S.-Japan matters, analysts said.

Her close ties to Obama come from playing a pivotal role during the Democratic presidential primaries in 2008 by endorsing him when Hillary Clinton was the lead candidate.

'What's important here is her strong pipeline with Obama and an ability to be able to pick up the phone and speak with Obama directly in the middle of the night for consultation on urgent matters,' said Ryuichi Teshima, professor of diplomacy at Keio University in Tokyo.

As
the first woman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan, Kennedy may also 
be a role model in a country that traditionally has restricted the role 
of women, said Toshihiro Nakayama, professor of international politics 
at Aoyama Gakuin University.

'I am also proud to carry forward my 
father's legacy of public service,' Kennedy said. 'He had hoped to be 
the first U.S. president to visit Japan.

So it is a special honor for me to be able to work to strengthen the close ties between our two great countries.'

U.S.-Japan
relations are generally on an even keel, but Obama and Japanese Prime 
Minister Shinzo Abe are not as close as some would like.

'The chemistry is off, possibly because Obama does not support the right-wing views Abe holds,' Teshima said.

Major
bilateral issues include the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, the
relocation of a U.S. military base on Okinawa and a revamp of defense 
cooperation guidelines between the two countries.

In
Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the warm 
welcome Kennedy received on arrival in Tokyo 'is a wonderful display of 
the strong relationship between the United States and Japan.'

Asked
about Kennedy's lack of diplomatic experience, Psaki told reporters: 'I
think she's displayed her commitment to working closely with Japan and 
working through all of the issues that we work together on.

'And she comes from a long line of public service. And we have no doubt she'll do an incredible job on the ground there.'

U.S. ambassadors to Japan can be grouped into three categories, Nakayama said. They are big political names, Japan experts and those with close ties to the president.

Former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale and former Senator Mike Mansfield fall into the first type. Edwin Reischauer, President Kennedy's envoy, would be the second.

Nakayama puts Caroline Kennedy, an attorney and author, in the third group, along with her predecessor, John Roos, a Silicon Valley lawyer and Obama fundraiser, and Tom Schieffer, who was George W. Bush's business partner in the Texas Rangers baseball team.
