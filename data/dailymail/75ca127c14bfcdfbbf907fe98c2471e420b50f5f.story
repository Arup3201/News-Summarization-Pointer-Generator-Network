It was the handheld plastic digital toy that was so addictive it was banned in some schools – and now it’s back.

The Tamagotchi is being updated by Japanese maker Bandai for the 21st century and will be released as Tamagotchi Friends.

And those who remember the basic graphics with fondness needn’t worry, because the new version will have the same simplistic look - it'll be set apart by its interactive functions.

Tamagotchi games were launched in 1996, with an incredible 80million units sold worldwide by 2010.

There were over 35 of the digital pets to choose from. They lived on a keychain device and had to be nurtured by the owner, from an egg to adult life. Owners had to give them medicine when they were poorly and clean up after they'd been to the loo.

The state of the creatures’ happiness and hunger levels were indicated by meters, which had to be monitored frequently.

The early versions didn't have a pause option and owners had to press a button every 30 minutes to feed them, otherwise they would starve to death.

Update: The new version launches in the UK in December 2014 and will feature short-range communication ability

This led to pupils the world over being distracted in class as they frantically tried to keep their Tamagotchi’s alive. It was a big enough problem for teachers in some schools that the toys were banned.

The new version launches in the UK on Boxing Day this year and is available for pre-order from The Entertainer and Amazon.co.uk priced £24.99.

It will feature a short-range communication function that will enable owners to ‘bump’ other Tamagotchi devices so their creatures can play together, send text messages, exchange gifts and even go on a date.

Apparently, the more they 'bump' the more points and rewards will be earned, with the totals reflected in a 'best friend meter'. It also includes new characters, five games - and crucially for teachers - a pause function and on-off sound function.

Bandai said: ‘Part fashion, part friendship, part community and all fun, the new Tamagotchi Friends combines the nurturing features and simple play pattern of the beloved handheld virtual pet, with exciting new entertainment that we believe will really resonate with Tamagotchi fans.

‘And now, with the new bump feature, similar to what’s found in today’s smartphones, these lovable, whimsical friends can connect with each other for massively increased levels of interaction.’

The Tamagotchi are actually aliens from the planet Tamagotchi. It’s said that they crash-landed on Earth and were placed in egg-shapped cases by The Professor and his assistant, Mikachu.

The rest is hand-held history.
