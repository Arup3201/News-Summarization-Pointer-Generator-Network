Celtic face an anxious wait to discover if their Champions League play-off clash with Maribor will go ahead next week after it emerged the Court for Arbitration for Sport will now hear Legia Warsaw’s case on Monday.

The Poles were thrown out of the competition – despite beating the SPFL champions 6-1 on aggregate – having played the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski in their 2-0 win over the Scots at Murrayfield.

Having failed in their appeal to UEFA this week, Legia feared their case with CAS would be time-barred but the Swiss court confirmed it will deal with it as a matter of urgency.

Reprieve:  Callum McGregor and his Celtic team-mates were reinstated to the Champions League 

Legia are seeking ‘urgent provisional measures’ to be put in place which would effectively see them reinstated in the competition and facing Maribor rather than travelling to Kazakhstan to face Aktobe in the Europa League.

In a statement on their website, CAS said: ‘The Court of Arbitration for Sport registered today at 17:30 a statement of appeal filed by the Polish club Legia Warsaw against the decision of the UEFA Appeals Body confirming the result 3-0 (forfeit) in favour of Celtic FC against Legia in the second leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League.

‘UEFA considered that Legia had fielded an ineligible player (Bartosz Bereszynski) during the match.

‘Legia requests urgent provisional measures from CAS allowing the Polish club to participate in the play-offs of the Champions League (20 & 26 August 2014). More generally, the club requests that the UEFA decision be set aside and that all sanctions against the club and the player Bereszynski be annulled.

‘The CAS has immediately initiated an arbitration procedure and the Respondents UEFA and Celtic FC have been invited to file written observations. A decision on request for provisional measures is likely to be issued on Monday 18 August around 18:00 (Swiss time).’

Outspoken: Legia Warsaw owner Dariusz Mioduski has slammed the decision not to reinstate his side

Meanwhile, Derk Boerrigter’s hopes of resurrecting his Celtic career were hit with a hammer blow last night when the SFA charged him with diving in the midweek win over St Johnstone.

With his side leading by a goal at Perth with 14 minutes remaining, the Dutchman crashed to the ground under seemingly minimal contact from Saints captain Dave Mackay.

Mackay’s anger at the penalty award – converted by Nir Biton – was compounded by a red card being shown by referee John Beaton. Celtic eventually won the game 3-0.

Having reviewed the incident, the SFA’s compliance officer offered Boerrigter a two-game suspension – or the prospect of taking his chances at a fast-track hearing next Thursday.

The winger, who has struggled to make an impact since joining from Ajax a year ago, has until Monday at 3pm to arrive at a decision.

Boerrigter has allegedly breached Rule 201 - causing a match official to make an incorrect decision by committing an act of simulation. 

 

The agony and the ecstasy: It looked like Legia were through and Celtic were out but the situation has changed

Mackay, meanwhile, will have a claim for wrongful dismissal dealt with at Thursday’s hearing.

Saints boss Tommy Wright was aggrieved not only at the penalty Celtic did get but one his side didn’t when his captain went down under a challenge by Virgil van Dijk.

He said: ‘My view is that one was a penalty and one wasn’t.’

Celtic manager Ronny Deila has vowed to hold showdown talks with his player if TV evidence proved he dived.
