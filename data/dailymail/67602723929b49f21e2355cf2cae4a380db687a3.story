A multimillionaire poker star has been dubbed Instagram's playboy king after chronicling blow-by-blow his extravagant, machismo-fueled life of near-naked women, sportscars and guns.

Los Angeles-based Dan Bilzerian describes himself as an 'actor/astronaut/a**hole' to his more than 100,000 Instagram followers who appear to live vicariously through the beefy, bearded 32-year-old, regularly begging in comments to trade his lavish life for theirs.

Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100 million, making the bulk of his cash as a 
high-stakes gambler having developed his skills as a student at the 
University of South Florida. However, his risky lifestyle has resulted in some serious repercussions, including a double heart attack and a pulmonary embolism, according to the Daily Dot.

Cars: His expensive vehicles, pictured, are adorned with personalized plates that read 'SUCK IT' and 'MR GOAT' - his other moniker

Bilzerian's Instagram feed includes a recent picture 
of a seal and a topless blonde woman in a swimming pool, with the caption: 'My
 buddy actually had a seal brought to the house and put in the pool 
haha.'

Another photo shows two luxury 
cars in the garage of his LA mansion with the comment: 'While I'm 
more of a t*t guy, I do appreciate a nice a**...' The vehicles are 
adorned with personalized plates that read 'SUCK IT' and 'MR GOAT' - his
 other favored moniker.

Another picture of more than a dozen semi-automatic weapons on a table has the caption: 'My greatest fear is that someone will break in & I won't be able to decide what #gun to shoot them with.'

The Tamba Bay native who does some acting on the side said his life has always been 
high-risk.

His father, Paul Bilzerian, a former corporate takeover 
artist, was sentenced to four years in jail and given a $1.5 million 
fine in 1989.

'I didn't get to enjoy much of it,' Bilzerian said of his childhood.

He
said he wasn't 'super-cool' in high school and went to both a 
military boarding school and to Utah to live with Mormons for a year.

In senior year, he ended up in jail for having a machine gun in the trunk of his car. But he managed to get his GED.

The gun-rights advocate then joined 
the military and made it 99 per cent through Navy SEAL training, he 
said. But two days before graduation he was thrown out for calling an 
officer a 'p****.'

'When he did my peer eval, (the officer) said I was only out for myself,' he said.

Bilzerian said he loved his time at the University of South Florida, which is where he started playing poker.

'I
 went broke after sophomore year, gambled away all my money, sold some 
guns, turned $750 into $10,000, flew to Vegas, turned 10 thou into 
$187,000, went back to school, played better,' he explained to The Daily
 Dot.

High-stakes: Bilzerian, pictured, made his millions as a high-stakes gambler, and he says betting on everything in life as his essential condition

Parties: The poker player posted a picture of a party at his mansion stating that it is 'starting to get interesting'

Crash: He crashed this Ferrari he said while he was on a date

Girls: Belzerian is almost always surrounded by girls in his posts

He said the turning point was losing everything.

'I respected the money. You have to go broke to respect the money.'

He has since won multiple tournaments, his most successful being the 2009 World Series of Poker. He is also co-founder of online poker room, Victory Poker.

Bilzerian described betting on everything in life as his essential condition but 
he hasn't always won. His health, in particular has suffered as a result
 of his high-flying lifestyle.

When
 he was 25, Bilzerian went on a 'four-day, very active snowboarding trip
 - traveling, not sleeping, hanging with friends, doing all kinds of 
...' his PR representative Steve Honig told the website, trailing off. It ended in a 
double heart attack.

'If you're familiar with his 
lifestyle, he's a bit of a daredevil. His body was absolutely overloaded
 after four days, and the heart condition happened.'

In
 August 2011, Bilzerian flew between Maui and Las Vegas twice in a 
three-day period to play around-the-clock poker and his heart gave out 
again. It turned out to be a pulmonary embolism not a heart attack, however.

July Fourth: This post from July 4th was littered with comments like 'That's a good lifestyle bro'

Private planes: The multimillionaire is regularly seen outside his private jet

Gun enthusiast: He wrote: 'Bought these sexy twins for the duck hunt in December #onesnotenough'

Now, Honig
 said Bilzerian is in perfect health while seemingly continuing to make 
the mega-bucks and enjoy spending them. Though he said the tournaments are harder to win these days, because amateur 
players put in a lot more hours and are perform better than they used to.

But Bilzerian said he wants to tidy up his badboy image, and is attempting to rebrand himself as 'the gentleman of poker.'

His efforts have involved giving away $100,000 of the money he's won in what he's calling the Robin Hood Project. So far he's helped Typhoon Haiyan victims, a couple who adopted four sick, underprivileged kids and a third woman who lost all her limbs.

But the Instagram pictures and the over-the-top lifestyle they represent continue, pleasing the fans who genuinely think of the money man as a king.

'I've seen a lot of people showing the good life on instagram but you sir are king,' Bilzerian follower danny_raf commented on a recent post.
