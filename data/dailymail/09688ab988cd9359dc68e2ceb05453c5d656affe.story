It's certainly a novel way to improve the interaction between man and bird.

A new sport has been launched which gives paragliders the opportunity to interact with vultures as they glide above the land: Parahawking.

Invented by avian expert Scott Mason to highlight the plight of Asia's endangered vultures, the sport combines ancient falconry methods with the modern techniques of paragliding, where both parties use rising currents of warm air to glide high above the land.

Way to go! The vulture comes in for a tasty morsel mid-air

'Birds of prey are able to gain height and fly long distances without flapping their wings,' explains Mason.

'We as paragliders harness their natural ability to conserve energy by following them as we fly.'

During the flight paragliders place small morsels of meat onto their gloved hands and the birds gently land to take the food, then fly gracefully away to find the next thermal.

'It's a perfect symbiotic relationship,' Mason said.

'Parahawking has gone from a personal experiment to a global phenomenon whereby several hundred people each year are taken on a tandem flight and given the unique opportunity to fly and interact with a bird of prey in its own environment.'

Vultures are often misunderstood and have a rather unsavory image, says Mason

Asia's vultures are virtually on the brink of extinction due to a drug called Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug commonly administered to sick and dying livestock across Asia which is poisonous to vultures.  

When the birds feed from animal carcasses that have been treated with Diclofenac, it causes renal failure and death.

The White Backed Vulture, The Slender Billed Vulture and the Long Billed Vulture have declined 99.9 per cent in the last 15 years, meaning 40 million birds have died.

'Vultures are often misunderstood and have a rather unsavory image,' says Mason.

'By using vultures for Parahawking we hope to change our perceptions of them. Parahawking is our unique and innovative contribution to help prevent the potential extinction of this important species.'

'By interacting and connecting with these majestic birds of prey we intend to raise awareness of the vultures' plight.'

If you're wondering why all the fuss about vultures, they play a vital role by disposing of dead matter that would otherwise pose a risk of disease, explains Mason.

Due to their decline there there has been a dramatic increase in feral dog numbers, which pose a risk to human health.

Parahawking is not just a joyride. It's an education in bird of prey behaviour and conservation as a whole.

Parahawking supports vulture conservation by donating 1000 rupees from every Parahawking tandem experience to selected vulture conservation projects in Nepal.

The parahawking season, based in Pokhara, Nepal, runs from around October to April. To try your hand at the sport, the price for is around £225 including two night's accommodation. 

It seems the sport is gaining in popularity: The Parahawking Project recently celebrated the sport's number one ranking as the top activity in Pokhara on TripAdvisor.
