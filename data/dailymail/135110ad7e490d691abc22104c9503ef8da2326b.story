We can all be forgiven for feeling a little peckish from time-to-time while on the job.

But for two policemen the urge proved unbearable - as they were pictured parking their van on double-yellow lines before popping into a supermarket.

The pair were left embarrassed when a member of the public captured both the illegally-parked van and the officers as they picked up sandwiches at a Sainsbury's in Newport, Isle of Wight.

The photographer, a 38-year-old company 
director who asked to remain anonymous, said that police should not abuse their position as law enforcers.

He said: 'I thought they might be going to 
investigate a report of a shoplifter, but when I went inside I could see
they were just buying their lunch.'

'Police should command respect and to do 
that they need to abide by the same rules that we all have to follow. 
They shouldn't use their position to their own advantage.

Senior officers have been informed of the incident and said the two officers involved would be spoken to.

Hampshire Constabulary's Chief Inspector Nick Heelan said: 'I have spoken to the member of the public and am grateful to him for reporting the incident.Â 

'The two officers involved have been 
identified and will be spoken to by me in regard to professional 
standards expected by Hampshire Constabulary.'
