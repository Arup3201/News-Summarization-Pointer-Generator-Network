Roxy is taken for a walk by wildlife sanctuary assistant manager Rosie Clinton

Foxes and hounds are usually enemies, but Roxy has lived for 13 years alongside dogs, going for 'walkies', playing fetch and chewing bones.

She was rescued by staff at Nuneaton and Warwickshire Wildlife Sanctuary, after being found almost strangled hanging off a bridge from rope around her neck.

But as volunteers at the sanctuary nursed the red fox back to health, they noticed she had canine tendencies and was used to human interaction.

When Roxy had recovered enough to be released back into the wild, staff were worried she had become too domesticated to survive - and were forced to let her stay at the sanctuary full time.

Lucky Roxy now enjoys a dog's life - playing with squeaky dog toys, chasing balls, and chewing on bones in the sanctuary's gardens.

She enjoys a daily walk with the centre's dogs, and walks to heel on the lead.

She even snuggles up to staff for tummy tickles and wags her tail in appreciation.

Geoff Grewcock, who runs the sanctuary, said: 'We found Roxy dangling from a bridge, caught in a rope. She was very lethargic, and obviously very ill.

'She seemed to be used to human interaction, so we believe someone had tried to hand rear her for a time.

'As we nursed her back to health, we realised she was far too tame to ever survive in the wild, so she made her home here.

Roxy became too domesticated to be released into the wild

'She's ever so friendly, and loves playing with all the dogs we have here.

'We have six foxes at the sanctuary, and although Roxy will occasionally have a sniff as she walks past them, she much prefers playing with the other dogs.

'But she seems to love human interaction most of all. She's very spoilt but she's such a lovely girl she deserves it.

'She's a bit of a diva - she turns her nose up at raw meat, and will only eat cooked chicken.

'We do get a lot of funny looks walking her around Nuneaton town centre on a lead with the other dogs - people tend to do a double take.

'She might not be your average fox, but she'll have a home for life here, and she's a delight to be around.'

The RSPCA advises against hand rearing foxes unless absolutely necessary, because they become 'imprinted'  and lose the ability to fend for themselves.
