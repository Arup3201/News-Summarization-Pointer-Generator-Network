Margaret Thatcher tried to stop a senior British diplomat linked to a paedophile scandal being named despite knowing of his 'unnatural' behaviour, it was claimed today.

A secret file prepared for the then Prime Minister revealed that Sir Peter Hayman had been engaged in ‘sexual perversion’ for decades and was vulnerable to blackmail by foreign powers.

Fears of a cover-up of VIP paedophile abuse intensified last night as the file which has remained secret for 35 years was published showing the extent to which Mrs Thatcher knew about the behaviour of Hayman.

The file detailing official investigations into the top diplomat, who was named in Parliament as a paedophile by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, shows how Hayman had been engaging in ‘sexual perversion’ as far back as 1966 and possibly even earlier.

Yet the depraved mandarin continued to enjoy a glittering career with his final posting being High Commissioner to Canada.

The Guardian reports that at one point, Mrs Thatcher amended part of the memo in such a way that it indicated that she did not believe Hayman should be named anywhere.

The memo, in a reference to Hayman, said: 'It is the policy of the law officers that persons who have been investigated by the police but not prosecuted should not be named in the House [of Commons], as to do so is to cast an unnecessary slur on the person without his having the opportunity to clear his name before a court.'

The Guardian says that at this point, Mrs Thatcher had crossed out 'in the House' - suggesting she did not believe the diplomat should be named.

The Stowe and Oxford-educated former Rifle Brigade officer who died in 1992, was a Home and Foreign Office mandarin, working closely with the intelligence services at the height of the Cold War occupying the post of Minister in West Berlin from 1964 to 1966.

He was only exposed in October 1980 when Private Eye magazine linked Hayman with the activities of Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children. 

Documents: Papers kept secret until they were released to the National Archives today  show reveal Mrs Thatcher was fully aware of the allegation aimed at Hayman

File: Hayman was let off with a caution because the Director of Public Prosecutions deemed the paedophile material sent through the post by Sir Peter and his friends had not been ‘unsolicited’

A secret file detailing official investigations into Hayman publicly released by the National Archives shows how the article sent Downing Street officials into a frenzied panic, amid fears that Hayman’s ‘sexual perversion’ made him vulnerable to blackmail from enemy states. 

There was also concern that his security vetting never revealed his depraved fantasies about children, which were referred to as a ‘character defect’. 

The newly released private papers were prepared for the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (pictured) in October 1980

The Private Eye revelations stemmed from the discovery of a package addressed to a Mr Henderson – a pseudonym used by Hayman – at Hayman’s Notting Hill flat, that was left on a London bus.

A police raid on the flat in 1978 uncovered a huge trove of pornographic materials and letters from members of the Paedophile Information Exchange.

Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors.

There was also substantial correspondence with other PIE members in which they shared their otherwise secret desires and other graphic paedophile material.

A total of seven men-including Hayman - and two women were named as ‘possible defendants’ in the report submitted by Scotland Yard to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

One of the accused was carrying correspondence by a tenth unnamed person who had an ‘obsession about the systematic killing by sexual torture of young people and children’.

However, Sir Peter was not prosecuted, leading to claims that his offences were covered up due to his diplomatic role and alleged connections with MI6.

He was let off with a caution as the Director of Public Prosecutions deemed that as the paedophile material sent through the post by Sir Peter and his friends had not been ‘unsolicited’ nor traded for profit, no offence had taken place worthy of prosecution.

But the newly released private papers prepared for the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1980 reveal that astonishingly no one in the Cabinet Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office nor the Security Services knew about the 1978 investigation until the article was published.

Lady Thatcher was so concerned about the affair that she wrote to the Attorney General saying: ‘So that there shall be no doubt, I leave it to your judgement whether or not you are interviewed on radio or TV about the Hayman matter. Margaret.’

Papers prepared for her in 1980 show that: ‘The police report showed that Sir Peter Hayman kept explicit and detailed records of his sexual activities and fantasies and that he was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange.

‘But the only activities which could be shown to have occurred were with consenting adults.

‘The material in the records relating to children appeared all to be fantasy.’

According to minutes by Sir Robert Armstrong, then Secretary of the Cabinet: ‘He (Hayman) had access to highly confidential and sensitive material.’

The files show how Sir Peter Hayman (pictured with wife Lady Hayman) had been engaging in ‘sexual perversion’ as far back as 1966 and possibly even earlier

But the report went on: ‘He has been, to all appearances, a health normal and happily married man.’

It said: ‘It is clear that Sir Peter Hayman was already engaging in sexual perversion in 1966 when he returned from Berlin to the Foreign Office and it must be presumed that he was doing so before that time.

‘He would of course have been especially vulnerable in Berlin.

‘While Sir Peter Hayman was High Commissioner in Ottawa there was a problem of obscene correspondence addressed to a fictitious female name at the High Commission, apparently as a result of advertisements placed in a pornographic magazine.

‘At the time this was laid at the door of a member of the domestic staff, the latest report raises the question whether it should have been laid at Sir Peter’ s door.’

It went on: ‘There must clearly be a full investigation, with a view to discovering whether anything more is known or suspected about Sir Peter Hayman’ s activities while he was serving in the Diplomatic Service and whether there is any reason to suppose that security was compromised.

New allegations have recently surfaced from an alleged victim named Nick who claims Hayman abused him at Dolphin Square (pictured)

‘This investigation is being undertaken by the Security Service.’

The Security Services interviewed 14 Foreign Office officials who identified two incidents during his period in Baghdad from 1959-1960 and his time in Ottawa between 1971 and 1974 as being a concern, although colleagues ‘had no cause to suspect that he might be engaged in irregular sexual activities’.

‘One of these will relate to his time in Berlin when he would have been particularly vulnerable if he had been involved in these activities,’ the report said.

‘Nothing has so far come to light from interviews which have been conducted to suggest Hayman’s vulnerability to blackmail came to the attention of hostile intelligence services at the time.’

The review later concluded that there had been no ‘prejudice to security’.

However, questions are sure to be asked about how rigorous the police and security services investigation was into his sordid past as new allegations have recently surfaced from an alleged victim named Nick who claims Hayman abused him at Dolphin Square.

The file is likely to be of significant interest to campaigners pushing for justice for the victims of historic sex abuse, and may be considered by the current child sex abuse inquiry commissioned by home secretary Theresa May.

The paper had remained hidden for 35 years and was only discovered by chance by an academic who stumbled upon the document title while researching secret Thatcher files at the National Archives in Kew.

But the Cabinet Office decided to publish its contents.

John Mann, a Labour MP who has campaigned on the issue, said: ‘All of these files that have been classified need to be opened up.

‘This one is of great importance.’ 

Diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile, was named by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1981 using Parliamentary privilege.

The new document, revealed today by Sky News, was written about the same period. 

Hayman was member ‘330’ of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children.

He rented a flat at 95 Linden Gardens, Notting Hill Gate, London under the name of Peter Henderson to store PIE literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles.

But Sir Peter made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a London bus. 

It was addressed to Mr Henderson at Linden Gardens in Notting Hill.Soon afterwards, in November 1978, police raided the Linden Gardens flat.

What they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography.

Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors. 

Even the hardened police of the Obscene Publications Squad were ‘revolted’ by the Linden Gardens haul.

He sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined. And yet he wasn't. 

Much to the anger and disbelief of the Obscene Publications Squad he was only given a caution.  He died in 1992 aged 77.

Geoffrey Dickens also said that an unnamed senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from Whitehall.

The MP claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children.

He said at the time: 'I'm concerned about the cover-up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised. He is a security risk'.
