Matthew Dillon, who found love and fathered two children during more than four years on the run

An escaped prisoner fathered two children with a woman who didn't know he was a wanted man before police caught up with him.

Matthew Dillon, 34, fled from Sudbury open prison in 2009, after he became 'fed-up' with his daily routine.

After staging the simple escape, Dillon found love and was living with his unwitting partner - who had no idea he was on the run - and their two children when police finally tracked him down.

Dillon left the open prison, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, in August 2009 as he neared the end of a 10 year eight month jail term for robbery.

But police did not track him down until September, even though he was living in Perton, West Midlands, just 40 miles away.

He was returned to jail on Friday after admitting one charge of escape from lawful custody at Stafford Crown Court.

Imprisoning him for the rest of his sentence, plus a further six months, Recorder Adam Feest said: 'It's a great shame you chose to walk out, you would have been released fairly soon afterwards.

'You have since shown you can live a law-abiding life.'

David Bennett, prosecuting, said police officers who arrested him asked Dillon why he had absconded from Sudbury and his reply was that he was 'fed up' with the prison's regime.

Mr Bennett said: 'He said he wanted to hand himself in, but he had met a partner, they'd had children together and he did not want to return to prison. His partner had no idea he had absconded from prison.'

The court heard that Dillon was sentenced in September 2004 for conspiracy to rob and was due for release after serving two-thirds of the jail term.

Mr Darron Whitehead, defending, said Dillon was only 24 when he got into serious trouble for 'a number of robberies'.

He served most of his sentence at Dovegate before being moved to Sudbury ahead of his scheduled release date.

Mr Whitehead added: 'He couldn't adjust to the new regime, he walked out and didn't come back.'The irony is that had he applied for parole he would probably have got it.'
