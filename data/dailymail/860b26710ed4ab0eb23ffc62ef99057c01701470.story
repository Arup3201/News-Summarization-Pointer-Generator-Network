The boss of an insurance firm has told how an ambulance smashed into his office just seconds after he had got up from his desk.

David Rose, 62, had just walked from his desk by the window of his office in Southfields, south London, yesterday, to the other side of the room when an emergency vehicle - which was responding to a serious incident - spun off the road and through his window.

The ambulance, driven by a female paramedic, ploughed through two steel bollards and the glazed shopfront before coming to a stop just eight feet away from where father of one Mr Rose stood.  Astonishingly, no-one was seriously hurt.

An ambulance smashed through the windows of the Rose Insurance offices in Southfields, London, yesterday

The ambulance is believed to have collided with the red car before spinning into the Rose Insurance office

Today Mr Rose, who has run his Rose Insurance firm from the office on Merton Road for 25 years, said: 'I would have been decapitated if I hadn't got up 20 seconds before to talk to a colleague and client on the other side of the room, as the ambulance went right over my chair and desk.'

But he insisted that despite his knowledge of the insurance world, he would not chase London Ambulance Service for compensation, saying: 'I detest that sort of thing.  I'm old school and I'm just going to tidy up and get on with it.'

The ambulance car collided with another car before it smashed through the building's frontage just after 5pm yesterday as Mr Rose and his office manager, Steve Terry, were talking to a client at the office counter.

Mr Rose said: 'We were talking to a client when he heard an awful noise and I turned round to see blue lights and I thought "They're getting a bit close" and suddenly it was in our office.'

He said he believed the ambulance was coming down the wrong side of the road when a car in the line of traffic on the other side turned right, into the ambulance's path.

Mr Terry, 53, said: 'When I heard the crash I just thought the ambulance had hit a car but it carried on going and the car ended up where Dave's seat was.

Crash scene: Mr Rose said he was not planning to sue because he 'detested all that' and was 'old school'

'Luckily nobody was hurt - it could have been a whole lot worse. My daughter works in Wimbledon Park and her mate went past on the bus and told her a car had gone through her dad's office.

'She was quite worried and came down in her car. She was relieved to find I was OK.'

Mr Rose, who said another ambulance crashed into his shopfront nine years ago, but caused less damage, added: 'The ambulance driver seemed OK and I haven't seen her since.

'Everyone was remarkably calm and all the locals came to help me clear up, which was lovely.'

He said the fire brigade helped winch the ambulance out and made his office secure with acrow props.

Lucky escape: Twenty seconds earlier, David Rose had been sitting at his desk beside the window

A spokeswoman for the London Ambulance Service would not elaborate on the nature of the emergency the car was heading to, but said: 'We can confirm one of our cars was involved in a road traffic collision at around 5pm, with another car near Merton Road, SW18. This car was on its way to a serious incident nearby.

'We sent a single responder, two duty officers, an advanced paramedic and an ambulance crew to the scene.

'We treated one patient for minor injuries and took her to St George's Hospital - but not as a priority.

'The medic, although shaken up, did not need to go to hospital.'

A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said: 'We were called just after 5pm to reports of two cars in a collision, one of which had entered a shopfront.

'No-one was reported trapped and our officers made the area safe.'
