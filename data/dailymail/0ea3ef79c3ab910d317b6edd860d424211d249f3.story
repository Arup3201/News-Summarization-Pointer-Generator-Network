Read Pietersen's forthright views on Andy Flower and his team of 'Boy Scouts'

Kevin Pietersen reserves some of the most stinging criticism in his autobiography for Matt Prior, and refers to him constantly as ‘Cheese’, as in ‘The Big Cheese’, a nickname Pietersen claims Prior called himself when he first broke into the England team. 

He also labels him ‘the schoolyard bully who is also the teacher’s pet.’

Pietersen accuses Prior - to whom he gave the 'Big Cheese' moniker because the keeper was 'a Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie' - of being the main cause of resentment towards him in the England dressing room and says he does not know why Andy Flower made him vice-captain of the team, a role Pietersen clearly coveted.

‘It was a sad time,’ says Pietersen in the book about the time he fell out with Prior during the tour of New Zealand last year. ‘I had been friends with Cheese. Now he was slowly losing any sense of himself as he turned up the volume and made himself the main man of the dressing room. 

'Our Cheese was out there, growing runny in the heat. A Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie.’

Pietersen also reveals that coach Andy Flower organised a one-on-one meeting after the New Zealand tour refereed by psychologist Mark Bawden to thrash out their problems and it was there the batsman accused Prior of being a ‘classroom bully.’

‘I said he wasn’t captaincy material or even vice-captaincy material,’ writes Pietersen of Prior. ‘I didn’t like the way he spoke about people behind their backs. How he belittled younger players. 

'How he was always complaining about Duncan Fletcher, who was and is a friend of mine. Too often he is to me an empty vessel making a lot of noise.’

Pietersen also accuses Prior of being part of the dominant clique in the dressing toom along with Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad. ‘And although Jimmy Anderson ran with them he wasn’t in the same league because at heart Jimmy is the nicest bloke in the world.’

There was also trouble between Pietersen and Prior in India after his ‘reintegration’ in 2012 when, Pietersen writes, he summoned Prior to his room in Nagpur and complained to him about his behaviour towards younger England players on the field. 

‘Being vice-captain seemed to go to his head,’ writes Pietersen of Prior after Stuart Broad had returned home injured. ‘Sad, especially when he isn’t really vice-captaincy material at all.’ 

Pietersen also ridiculed Prior for taking his own bike on the 2013 tour to New Zealand and mocked his cycling kit, saying he'd get into his Team Sky uniform 'looking like Clark Kent'.
