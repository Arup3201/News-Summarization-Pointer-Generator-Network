Japanese officials today said they are
 ready to provide an anti-flu drug as a potential treatment to fight the
 rapidly expanding ebola outbreak.

Chief
 cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan may respond to emergency 
individual requests for the favipiravir tablet, before any official 
decision by the World Health Organisation.

The
 drug, developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm Holdings to treat novel and
 re-emerging influenza viruses, was approved by the Japanese health 
ministry in March.

It is available at any time, at the request of WHO, officials said today.

It
 comes as a the first British victim of the outbreak, nurse William 
Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly 
virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone.

Despite
 the grave dangers, he had selflessly volunteered to serve in a 
makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too 
scared to come into work.

Mr Pooley last night arrived back to London in an isolation sack for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.  

Last night the NHS started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus.

ZMapp,
 an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients, has shown 
promising results, apparently aiding the recovery of two U.S. 
missionaries who contracted the virus.

But Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the American company behind it, says stocks are exhausted.

A
 source at the Department of Health said: 'We are working with our 
international partners to source remaining doses for the patient.'

The WHO said earlier this month that it is ethical to use untested drugs on ebola patients given the magnitude of the outbreak.

Fujifilm
 spokesman Takao Aoki said ebola and influenza viruses are the same type
 and theoretically similar effects can be expected on Ebola.

He said the drug has also proved effective in lab experiments on mice. Fujifilm said it has favipiravir stock for more than 20,000 patients.

The company is also in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on clinical testing of the drug in treating Ebola.

Favipiravir is one of only a few drugs that may work on ebola. Several drugs are 
being developed for ebola treatment.

But they are still in early stages 
and there is no proven treatment or vaccine for the highly fatal 
disease, and Fujifilm's drug is one of only a few new drugs that may 
work on ebola.

Favipiravir
 inhibits viral gene replication within infected cells to prevent 
propagation, while conventional ones are designed to inhibit the release
 of new viral particles to prevent the spread of infection, the company 
said.

Recently, two 
Americans, Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol, have been treated with another experimental drug called ZMapp,
 developed by San Diego Mapp Biopharmaceutical.

The drug had never been tested on humans, although an early version had been found to work in some ebola-infected monkeys.

It is aimed at boosting the immune system's efforts to fight the disease.

Mr
 Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola 
outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when 
scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with
 the virus.

Health officials
 last night said Mr Pooley was 'not seriously unwell' – a factor which 
will significantly boost his chance of survival. Most patients die of 
ebola because of dehydration, when their blood vessels break down and 
their major organs fail.

But
 fit, young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly 
improved chance of survival. If they are hydrated and the bleeding 
controlled, their immune systems can in some cases kick in, and defeat 
the virus.

Pictures have emerged of the moment a British charity worker was evacuated back to the UK on board a Royal Air Force jet

Experimental serum ZMapp was created from a combination of antibodies in January.

Until the drug was given to the American Ebola sufferers, it had only been tested on monkeys.

It is unclear exactly how it works but both Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol recovered from Ebola after receiving the serum.

It is only available in limited supplies as larger scale human testing is needed to prove it safe and effective. 

The companies behind the drug, ZMapp and Kentucky BioProcessing are currently working to have the product approved and the production accelerated.

The companies said in a statement: 'It is important to note that the emergency use of an experimental medicine is a highly unusual situation.

'As a consequence global high-level discussions concerning the policy, ethical, and medical implications of this exceptional situation have been initiated.'

The WHO has put the number of people infected with the deadly ebola virus at 2,615.

Some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March, before spreading to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.

Rigorous
 quarantine measures are used to stop the spread of ebola, as well as 
high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with 
sufferers.

Symptoms of the virus appear as a sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat.

This
 is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver 
function and, in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

The effects of the disease normally appear between two and 21 days after infection.

It is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through person-to-person transmission.

The
 WHO said the disease can be passed between people by direct contact - 
through broken skin or mucous membranes - with the blood, secretions, 
organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and indirect contact 
with environments contaminated with such fluids.

Treatment: The hospital is the only centre in the UK equipped to treat ebola and prevent the disease from spreading

U.S. doctor Kent Brantly is pictured saying goodbye to the team that saved him at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia after he was successfully treated for ebola using the experimental drug Zmapp

Aid worker Nancy Writebol, pictured with her husband David, was also treated at the Atlanta hospital using Zmapp. Manufacturers of the drug say stocks of the drug are exhausted

The
 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued updated travel advice last
 week which urged people to carefully assess their need to travel to 
Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

'General
 medical facilities throughout Sierra Leone are currently under severe 
strain due to the Ebola outbreak, and unable to provide the same 
standard of healthcare as in the UK.

'Dedicated healthcare facilities for Ebola are overwhelmed,' the FCO warned.

The
 Sierra Leone parliament has voted to pass a new law which means anyone 
caught hiding an Ebola patient can receive prison terms of up to two 
years.

Some 910 cases have 
been recorded in the country - and 392 deaths - but the WHO believes the
 magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are 
hiding infected friends and family in their homes.

The
 WHO reported that corpses are being buried in rural villages without 
notifying health officials and with no investigation of the cause of 
death.

In
 some instances epidemiologists have travelled to villages and counted 
the number of fresh graves as a rough estimate of suspected cases.
