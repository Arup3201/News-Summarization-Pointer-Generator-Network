It was almost thrown back into the furnace as a worthless piece of metal when it was cast in 1919.

But now a 'dud' one penny piece accidentally could sell for more than £2,500 - 600,000 its original value.

The sterling penny, made from a blend of copper and nickel instead of bronze, is the only one of its kind.

Valuable: The sterling penny made from copper and nickel could be the only one of its kind in the world

It was cast 1919 after the Royal Mint in London subcontracted work to a factory in Kings Norton, Birmingham, because was preoccupied with striking war medals.

At the time, the Kings Norton Metal Company was making British West Africa pennies for use in the colonies of Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leonne and the Gambia.

During a production run of standard pennies two blanks for British West Africa pennies made it into the batch.

When the mistake was realised, one was thrown back into the furnace and the other was kept by the engineer.

The copper-nickel coin was then passed to Francis Edward Brown, a local industrialist, and has remained in his family ever since.

Accompanying the coin is a letter from Mr Brown in which he describes it as a 'nickel penny - the only one in the world'.

Paperwork proving the coin's history will be included in the auction.

Unique: A letter written by the coin's former owner, industrialist Francis Edward Brown, highlights its special value

In 1919 there were 240 pennies in a pound.

Daniel Fearon, coin specialist at auctioneers Woolley and Wallis, said that the Royal Mint had verified the coin as original.

He said: 'This coin has no official status because it never entered circulation.

'Following the war the Royal Mint were very busy striking war medals so they subcontracted a lot of work to the Kings Norton Metal Company near Birmingham.

'Since then it has been passed on down through his family including through the hands of his son David Brown, who gave his initials to the famous DB line of Aston Martin cars.

'The coin may have little face value but it is unique - there is nothing else like this.

'As with all auctions provenance is everything, and this coin's provenance is fantastic - it can be traced right the way back to its production in 1919.

'Our estimate is up to £2,500 but it could go for quite a bit more.'
