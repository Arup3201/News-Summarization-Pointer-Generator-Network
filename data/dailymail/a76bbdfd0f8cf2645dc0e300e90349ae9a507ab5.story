A new book written by a panel of men seeks to advise women on the 'do's and don'ts' of dating from a brutally honest male perspective.

Written by seven New York-based men who are both in and out of relationships, Single Man, Married Man argues that 'every man want to get married' and poses a blunt question to its female readers: 'So why not with you?' 

'No matter where a woman was in life, she should always be able to cater to her man’s needs,' one single author writes in an extract published by DNAinfo, while a divorced co-author advises: 'When he gets his ego stroked, he will be more inclined to love you more.'

You're doing it wrong: Written by seven New York-based men who are both in and out of relationships, Single Man, Married Man argues that 'all men' want to get hitched and poses, 'so why not with you?'

Single Man, Married Man was compiled by childhood friends Jean Alerte, a 33-year-old married businessman who owns a Brooklyn yogurt shop, and Frank Gateau, a 32-year-old 'serial dater' who works in PR.

Other co-authors include entrepreneur Jickael Bazin, blogger Rae Holliday, life coach Pervis Taylor III, writer Zangba Thomson and musicians DJ Fadelf and Kel Spencer.

'Where exactly did the romance go now that Prince Charming barely pays attention to you anymore?' the book's website reads.

'It takes a lot to hold their attention, and men tend to lose interest in romantic partners when they stop being, well... interesting.'

Mr Alerte and Mr Gateau - who claim that when men say they don't want to get married, they're 'lying' - spent three years surveying more than 300 male subjects online and in person to arrive at their conclusions.

One contributor described as single mentions the song 'Cater 2 U' by Destiny's Child as being an anthem that 'should be on every woman’s playlist and kept on repeat.'

He advises: 'Prepare his meals, draw him a bath and massage his feet every now and then.'

Another author, this time married, claims that if a man doesn't want to argue with you, it does not mean he is 'weak.'

He suggests: 'It possibly alludes to the exact opposite, that he possesses an inner strength to make the intelligent decision to exit the situation.'

On a chapter which deals with 'why men lie', a single man suggests that telling the truth is 'risky' and that lies are perpetuated 'to get our women to listen to us.'

And then there's the million-dollar question. Why do men cheat?

One man, again single, joked that while a man can 'cheat on his woman' and still 'sleep like a baby' in the same bed, switching his barber will make him feel 'bad.' Said gentleman described this foible as 'hilariously funny and true.'

He also warned that for men, a new career can often trigger temptation to cheat.

'We are exposed to a new supply of women who weren’t previously available, so we feel the need to explore these potential new mates that are now accessible,' he states.

A divorced contributor put cheating down to man being a 'natural predator' who will only stop 'stalking his prey' when a woman either 'gives in' or 'ignores his every advance.'

The Single Man, Married Man website lists a selection of reviews of the book, almost all from women.

'I'm sure ladies will appreciate this book', wrote Natasha, from San Francisco, California, dubbing it 'very refreshing.'

'I found myself agreeing and caught myself saying "yes, yes",' wrote Cindy from Atlanta, Georgia.

Single Man Married Man is available for pre-order online and hits bookstores February 10. Just in time for Valentine's Day.
