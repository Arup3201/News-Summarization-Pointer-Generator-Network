The Obama administration is poised to entertain a flood of new clemency applications from thousands of federal prisoners who were given harsh sentences under mandatory-minimum laws following drug convictions, Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday.

Holder said in a short videotaped statement that he wants to shrink the federal prison population by a modest amount while ensuring 'that those who have paid their debts have a chance to become productive citizens.'

At the center of the move is a set of old sentencing rules that punished crack-cocaine offenders with more time behind bars than users or traffickers of powder cocaine. Civil rights groups have claimed the practice amounted to racial bias since crack – a solid, smokable form of the highly addictive drug, has been more popular in African-America, inner-city communities since its introduction to the U.S. in the early 1980s.

The announcement is part of an ongoing Obama administration push to re-evaluate sentences for drug crimes that officials believe were unduly harsh and were imposed under old federal guidelines that treated convictions for crack cocaine offenses more punitively than those involving the powder form of the drug.

Big move: Attorney General Eric Holder announced that his Department of Justice will start presenting far more clemency requests from drug offenders to the president for his consideration

Cocaine has more than a century's worth of history in the United States, reaching its apex in the 1960s and '70s during a period of social permissiveness that embraced drug use and sexual promiscuity

Clarence Aaron of Mobile, Alabama was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for possession with intent to distribute cocaine; President Obama commuted his sentence in December

But the new rules will also embrace sentencing disparities of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine users and low-level dealers. The GOP-led 'War on Drugs' era included dramatic increases of some mandatory sentences, a move designed to crush networks of narcotics dealers and sweep the streets clean.

Holder suggested Monday that the move hadn't achieved its goal, and had left thousands languishing in custody unfairly.

'There are still too many people in federal prison who were sentenced under the old regime – and who, as a result, will have to spend far more time in prison than they would if sentenced today for exactly the same crime,' he explained in his video.

'This is simply not right.'

Reactions were partisan and swift. 'What you see is a moral imperative being seized on by the White House,' a Democratic strategist in Michigan told MailOnline. 'This is the stuff of legacy building.'

A Republican election consultant, also in Michigan, countered that President Barack Obama's timing was suspect.

'Isn't it an election year?' He asked. 'Oh, yes. That's right. It is. Anything to distract his base from the miserable failure of Obamacare.'

In December Obama announced that he had commuted the sentences of eight federal drug convicts, including six who were handed life sentences.

'Each of them has served more than 15 years in prison,' the president noted at the time.

'In several cases, the sentencing judges expressed frustration that the law at the time did not allow them to issue punishments that more appropriately fit the crime.'

A month later the Justice Department issued guidance encouraging U.S. defense lawyers to help drug offenders with no history of violence to start the process of appealing to the White House for clemency.

In the 1980s the advent of cheaper 'crack' cocaine rocks brought the drug a wider market, and it quickly became a drug of choice in the black community in the U.S.

Ezell Gilbert of Tampa, Florida (L) was given a 292 month sentence in 1997 for possession with intent to deliver cocaine base and marijuana, and Stephanie Yvette George of Pensacola, (R) got a life sentence the same year for conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute; Obama freed them both in December

International: Drug trafficking is a trillion-dollar business worldwide, with much of the narcotics smuggled into the U.S. and other nations through increasingly ingenious methods like this cache stowed inside heavy machinery

The Obama administration has begun to add dozens of lawyers to the legal staff assigned to handle such applications. Historically, very few have been approved. But that could change soon, now that Holder has opened the door for a new criterion: the difference between an existing sentence and oen that would be handed down today in similar circumstances.

'The Justice Department is committed to recommending as many qualified applicants as possible for reduced sentences,' Holder said.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Monday that he couldn't estimate how many felons would be released. 

'In terms of how many deserving candidates are out there, I couldn't begin to speculate,' he said.

Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Associated Press that he was excited by the prospect of a sudden break from the past inertia in clemency applications.

'What you see is some focused attention on the part of the administration to deal with this in a serious way,' he told the AP.

Members of Congress quizzed Holder this month in a Capitol Hill hearing, with Virginia Republican Rep. Randy Forbes asking why broader groups of clemency applications from Americans convicted of 'white-collar crime or campaign finance laws or a host of other areas that have been over-criminalized, all who also do the [prison] overcrowding that we’re very concerned with, but have a much lower recidivism rate.'

'We’re dealing with a particular problem,' Holder replied, 'and that is that I think the pendulum swung a little too far in the ’80s' with drug enforcement.
