The National Security Agency has been sharing information likely to contain details of phone calls and emails of U.S citizens with Israel, according to secret documents.

A memorandum of understanding provided to the Guardian newspaper by whistleblower Edward Snowden reportedly shows that the NSA has been handing intercepted communications over to its Israeli counterpart without screening out information about its own citizens first.

Although the memorandum stresses that the Israelis should not deliberately target Americans, there is no legal obligation to comply by U.S. demands.

Despite previous assurances from Barack Obama that a so-called 'minimisation' process safeguards the privacy of U.S. citizens, the five page memorandum reportedly makes it clear that information is shared in its raw, pre-'minimisation' state.

It discloses that Israel is entitled to 'raw signant' or signal intelligence adding: 'Raw signant includes, but is not limited to, unevaluated and unminimised transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content.'

According to the Guardian, while the NSA said that any information supplied to Israel is given via procedures designed to protect privacy rights, it did not deny that unvetted communications were being shared.

It also refused to comment when questioned whether permission to hand over such information had been sought from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (Fisa) court.

Under the agreement between the two countries, which is said to have been reached in 2009, Israel is allowed to retain information identifying U.S. citizens for up to a year.

Israeli's have to inform an NSA liason adviser when such files are found and any files containing government communications must be destroyed, according to the memo.

Although the NSA should have a warrant to target citizens of its own country, it is allowed to collect details of communications with a foreign target without a warrant.

Israeli intelligence can disseminate the information given to it by the U.S. as long as it doesn't identify the American in question.

Israel can however release U.S. identities to 'outside parties' with written U.S. permission, according to the Guardian.

An NSA statement said: 'Whenever we share intelligence information, we comply with all applicable rules to protect U.S. person information.'
