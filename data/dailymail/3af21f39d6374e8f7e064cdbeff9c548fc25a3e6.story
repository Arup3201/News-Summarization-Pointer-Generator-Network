The body of a teenager who disappeared after a music festival in the United States at the weekend has been recovered from a lake six days after he was last seen.

Wynter Levi Emerson, from Nelson on New Zealand's South Island, was travelling in the U.S when he went missing after the Bumbershoot music and arts festival held in Seattle every Labor Day weekend.

Seattle Police confirmed on Monday morning the body pulled from Lake Union, just a few kilometres from where the festival was held at the Seattle Centre,  belonged to Wynter Emerson.

'We do not suspect foul play at this point,' officer Patrick Michaud told Stuff.co.nz, before adding that their investigation supported that.

The teenager, who had been travelling around Canada and the United States on a gap year, was last seen on September 1 at the close of the festival. 

He was reported missing the next day by a friend, and his passport and wallet were reportedly handed in to police.

Messages of support flowed in for Wynter's family both during their search for him and after his body was found.

A social media campaign to try and locate Wynter began on Monday after his family was told he had not been seen for a number of days following Bumbershoot.

According to a Facebook page set up by his brother - Help Us Find Wynter Emerson - family and friends suspected the 18-year-old may have got into some trouble after the festival.

The 18-year-old went missing after Bumbershoot music and arts festival which finished on September 1

His body was found in Lake Union, very close to where the Labor Day festival was held 

'Wynter has been reported missing now for almost a week. The last time anyone heard from him was at the Bumbershoot Festival. It was reported that he may have been slipped drugs,' a post on the page read.

'His wallet was found at a construction site near 6th & Bell. He is alone and has no idea where he is. His cellphone is not working and likely does not have any money. PLEASE if you have seen him in Seattle, send for help. 

'He is from New Zealand and is not aware of his surroundings. Take the five seconds to share this post. It might just save his life. Praying that he is still okay...' the post concluded.

The teenager's family were notified of the 18-year-old's death early on Tuesday morning.

'Hey everybody thanks for the support. We have just been informed that they found his body, will no longer need to find Wynter. R.I.P', Wynter's brother wrote on the page.

A member in another group - Where is Wynter Emerson - also penned a post about the New Zealander's passing.

'It is with sadness that I post that earlier this morning Wynter's family was notified that Wynter has passed away,' Susan Schuler wrote.

'Our hearts and prayers are with his family and friends at this tragic time. Thank you to everyone who made efforts to try and find Wynter. RIP Wynter Emerson...you are loved.' 

The teenager had taken a gap year and was travelling around Canada and the US before returning home to study at the end of the year

He was discovered in Lake Union, just a few kilometres from where Bumbershoot festival was held in the Seattle Centre

On Monday the teenager's parents Shon and Ally Emerson described the ordeal of having their son go missing overseas as 'the worst day of our lives'.

'Obviously we are heart sick with worry and just want our boy to be safe, we love him so much', Ally wrote on Facebook.

A fund has now been created to help Wynter's family bring him home to New Zealand. 

'We're so devastated at the loss of our beloved Wynter. His body was found at Lake Union, Seattle this morning. Please take a moment to remember him and his family and donate even a penny to help his family bring Wynter home. Even the slightest amount helps. You can donate via debit/credit if you do not have a PayPal. We love you Wynter. R.I.P,' his brother wrote on Facebook.
