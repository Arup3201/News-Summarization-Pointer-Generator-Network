Be still our beating hearts, this midi length suede skirt is the stuff of dreams...

It's not actually available until April, but it is already whipping the fashion world into a frenzy. And not just for the fact that style icons Alexa Chung and Olivia Palermo both wore it in the space of one week. But also because it's from Marks and Spencer. Yes, you read that right - good old M&S!

It's from their Autograph collection, and if you'd like to stock up on some of their current season styles (as modelled by supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, no less), then click (right) now.

We're counting down the days until it lands online and in store. We love the A-line shape, strokable texture, tan shade and retro Seventies style of this skirt, which Alexa teamed with ankle boots and a black shirt tucked in. Plus, with those stitched pocket details, it wouldn't look out of place on a catwalk at London Fashion Week!

Retail chain Debenhams has seen the most popular size of the average handbag sold shrink by almost 200 per cent, according to a recent sales analysis with styles such as H! Henry Holland iridescent 'milk carton' bag and Bailey and Quinn's mini tote bag leading new trend.

Two years ago the average handbag size was 12' wide x 8.5'high x 5'depth, which due to the tapering shape of most larger bags, plus lining fabric and compartments, would create an average of 350 cubic inches of internal space.

But now the average size of bags purchased this year, has dropped to 8'wide x 5'high x 3' depth, with approximately 120 cubic inches of space inside - almost three times smaller than the previous most popular bag size.

One in three female shoppers already own or are planning to buy a smaller bag thanks following in the footsteps of celebrities such as Alexa Chung 

Both Taylor Swift and Lily Aldridge have been spotted recently carrying the new bijou tote 

The trend for a bijou bag may have been helped along by a strong celebrity following with famous faces such as Taylor Swift, Alexa Chung and even the Duchess of Cambridge downsizing their arm-candy.

An additional survey for the retailer found that the trend was set to increase among the public with one in three female customers (32 per cent) either owning, or were intending to buy a smaller handbag within the next four months.

Recent designer brands to launch mini and even micro bags include Moschino, with one of the smallest at 2.4' x 3.5', Valentino, Mulberry, and Dolce and Gabbana with one of the largest at 5' x 6.7'.  

For most women a slightly larger bag is needed for everyday accessories, but many are jumping on the downsizer bandwagon and using it as an excuse for a personal-possession detox, according to the Debenhams study.

The most popular item which women said they would dump to make room for essentials in a smaller bag was, old receipts, closely followed by 'old/used-up' make-up, with extra pairs of tights, umbrella, knickers and even spare shoes, getting a mention.

Head of Accessories Natelle Baddeley said: 'For years women have filled holdall size handbags with everything from make-up and hair straighteners to laptops, ipads and even a change of clothes on occasion.

'So it's not surprising that this latest fashion for a lighter load on our arms has taken off. 

'The designs are gorgeous, but the size means women have no choice but to be ruthless about the items they carry around with them.

'There is something very appealing about stripping back possessions to the bare essentials and realising that all those 'just in case items' were weighing us down physically and maybe mentally too.'
