Moody moggie: Ginny Murphie says her cat Teddy Bear can be moody but is generally very docile and sweet-natured with humans

Meet Ginny Murphie the owner of the 'Essex lion' who this week revealed her less-than ferocious feline is actually just a pussycat.

Her three-year-old cat Teddy Bear sparked Britain's biggest safari hunt earlier this week when terrified holidaymakers thought they'd seen a lion - but it was in fact Teddy on an evening stroll through a stubble field.

Today, former fitness instructor Mrs Murphie said her 3ft long Maine Coon isn't like a lion at all - just very docile and loves nothing more being doted on.

She said: 'He's the boss of the 
dog but he's quite docile and sweet-natured with humans.'

Mrs Murphie was away in Liverpool when the story about the 'Essex lion' broke on Sunday evening.

The 50-year-old watch the drama unfold on television - but as she watched the police 
cars racing to the scene near her home in St Osyth, Clacton on Sea, Essex, she had a sneaking feeling that her very own 'big cat' was behind the saga.

Mrs Murphie said Teddy Bear's five minutes
of fame hadn't gone to his head - although he has been happily posing for photos.

She said: 'He's been 
sleeping and he's been very tired but he's out at the moment.

'He was superb with the film crew yesterday and he loved having his photo taken. He absolutely loved all the attention, but it's not gone to his head.'

When Mrs Murphie bought her cat three years ago she hoped he'd stay indoors and keep her company after she was diagnosed with liver cancer.

But she was in for a shock as Teddy Bear discovered a passion for the outdoors - possibly triggered by Mrs Murphie's dog Billy who she says relentlessly insists on playing with him.

Roaming round gardens and paths near her home she soon realised he loved nothing more than stalking for prey and took a shine to one particular field.

She said: 'He likes 
that field, it's his field, and he goes hunting for hares all the time.

'Sometimes he disappears for 
two or three days, but he always comes back, but he spends a lot of time
out. He's a bit of a sulky cat because the dog gets all the attention. 
Sometimes he does get in a strop.'

She added: 'He's only 
lion-like with the dog, he hisses at him and the dog irritates him 
immensely as he always wants to play with him.'

On the prowl: Teddy stalks through a stubble field yesterday just days after he was mistaken for the Essex lion 

Mrs Murphie said she knew straight 
away Teddy was responsible for the safari hunt when she saw the blurry 
photo of the 'lion' taken by witnesses.

The Maine Coon, also known as American Longhair, is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America.

They are renowned for their size and are known as the 'gentle giants' of the feline world, and have a rectangular body shape and a long flowing coat.

They can weigh up to 25lbs and are not considered fully grown until they are four or five years old.

They have a beard around their necks which can look like a lion's mane and long hair around their legs and chest.

Unusually for cats they also enjoy playing with water.

She said he's been mistaken for a fox before, adding: ‘All my friends were joking
that it must be Teddy. When I saw the photo I recognised him straight 
away. The way his ears were and his head. It's definitely him.’

Armed officers and two police 
helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to 
run, were scrambled in a bid to track down the wild animal following Sunday's reports.

Workers
from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the 
fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were 
temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre.

Mrs Murphie, married to engineer Dave, 51,
said she realises now how Teddy, with his ginger mane, could have been 
mistaken for a lion.

She said: 'I've just looked across the field now and I can see a white cat and it looks huge. It's a question of perspective.'

The mother-of-three added: ‘We thought it had to be 
Ted as he’s the only big gingery thing around there and he does tend to 
wander into that field.’

'As we were away he probably went into the field to sulk.

Here, kitty kitty: Mrs Murphie, who is battling liver cancer, says this is definitely her cat Teddy and she knew it was him as soon as she saw the picture. She said from a distance he can look quite big

‘From a distance, because he has a light coloured mane he does look a little lion like. I can see why someone would think that.'

Teddy is a Maine Coon which is the biggest breed of domestic cat and can grow up to 25lbs.

Mrs Murphie is waiting for an important update on her cancer this week and might have to 
raise £50,000 for a new treatment called immunotheraphy which is 
available in Germany and could help fight her disease.

Roar! The feline likes to boss dogs around but is very sweet-natured with humans and enjoys hunting hares

She said: 
‘I got him because I wanted some comfort and he has been brilliant. 
What’s happened has really cheered me up, it is quite amusing.'

Despite Mrs Murphie’s certainty as to 
the culprit in Operation Pussycat, however, there remain several 
witnesses who remain equally convinced that the creature they saw was 
much more than just a little kitty.

First to spot the animal was Denise 
Martin, 52, a warehouse worker from Canvey Island, on holiday at Earls 
Hall Farm with her husband Bob.

Big cat? Teddy Bear is so large and ginger that he's been mistaken for a fox before - but never a lion

Playtime: Teddy Bear is a three ft long Maine Coon - the largest domestic cat - and Mrs Murphie said she can understand why people might think he was a lion from a distance. She said she enjoys playing in this field

‘There
was some smoke from a bonfire, but it cleared I could see this shape in
the field, so I got the binoculars out,’ she said yesterday.

‘I said to my husband, “What do you make of that?” He said, “That’s a lion.” We weren’t scared at all – it was excitement.

‘You
don’t often see something like that in the wild. At one point time it 
sat up and looked at us and we could see its ears twitching. It knew we 
were there and it sat down and started cleaning itself.’
