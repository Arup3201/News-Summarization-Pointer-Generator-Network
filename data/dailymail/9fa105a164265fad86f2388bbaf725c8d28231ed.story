A Baltimore man convicted of dousing his unsuspecting roommate with boiling water after accusing him of eating all of his breakfast sausages has been sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Prosecutors say 39-year-old Donte Frye was found guilty of assault for luring his roommate to the top of the basement stairs and throwing a pot of boiling salt water on his face in April 2013. 

The victim tumbled down the stairs and hit his head on the door. The attack left the man with second-degree burns and severe scarring, which required months of treatment.

Prosecutors say Frye was mad because he mistakenly thought his roommate had eaten his breakfast treats. 

Describing Frye as a 'violent repeat offender,' the State's Attorney's Office said jail records indicate that he felt no remorse for the attack and even bragged about stabbing another roommate.

According to officials, the 39-year-old poked fun at the man disfigured by burns saying that the boiling water 'ain't an actual weapon' and that 'the dude wasn't even bleeding,' reported WBAL-TV.

According to the Baltimore Sun, Frye's attorney, Stephen Beatty, has attempted to play down the April 11, 2013, incident saying that his client and the victim were both to blame for the scuffle, and that the prosecution had exaggerated the extent of the man's injuries.

Donte Frye was sentenced Monday to 25 years without the possibility of parole.

The hefty prison term follows two prior convictions for attempted murder. Prosecutors say Frye stabbed two roommates in separate incidents in 1993 and 2004.

Frye's criminal record also includes multiple drug and firearm charges.
