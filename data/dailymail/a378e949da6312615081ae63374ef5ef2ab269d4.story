Almost £90,000 worth of goods has been stolen from Parliament buildings since 2010, official figures reveal.

Expensive electronic gadgets including iPads, laptops and cameras have been regularly targeted by Parliamentary thieves.

But House of Commons documents reveal that MPs and their staff have reported a host of other bizarre thefts – including of a teddy bear, some champagne and even a dental mould.

Other items which have been reported stolen include an 'orchid', 'beer casks', a 'pedal bikes', 'six boxes of mints' and some 'floral arrangements'.

Some £900 in cash, £450 worth of knives and a £1,700 Rolex watch have also been stolen.

The thefts comes despite armed police and sniffer dogs patrolling the Palace of Westminster 365 days a year.

Just under £11,500 worth of goods were stolen from Parliament this year, official  figures show. This is more than double the £4,200 worth of items which went missing last year.

In 2012, goods valued at £17,500 went missing - down from a whopping £43,600 worth of laptops, iPads and other gadgets which were stolen in 2011. In the first year of the Coalition, goods worth £10,500 were stolen.

Tory MP Keith Simpson said: 'It's worrying people working here may be stealing.'

Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner was one of the most high-profile victims of the Parliamentary crime spree when his bike was stolen.

The 82-year-old MP discovered the theft of his 18-gear hybrid bike when he turned up to collect mail before a meeting of Labour's National Executive Committee.

He said: 'It was parked 20 yards from a police box - but they can't keep an eye on my bike all day long.'

Mr Skinner says he used the bike for exercise, completing three or four laps of Hyde Park on fine days in the Spring and Summer.

He said: 'I have always cycled and then I had a heart bypass. I have always walked and so on and kept pretty fit.'

The Palace of Westminster is not the only public building seen as an easy target for thieves.

The Ministry of Defence has come under heavy fire for the amount of military kit it has mislaid.

Figures released by the MoD show alleged thefts have totalled more than £7 million over the last seven years.

The figures were made public by the MoD in response to a written parliamentary question from Nick de Bois, a Conservative MP.

Tthe stolen items include £5,800 worth of anti-impotence Viagra pills, also used for conditions including blood pressure, and equipment from nuclear submarines from RAF Marham in Norfolk.

In the past year 100 bayonets, thousands of rounds of live and blank ammunition, a Bedford truck and an industrial washing machine have all been stolen from MoD sites across the country.

Lead flashing and roofing, copper piping, electrical cables and radiators have also been stolen by metal thieves, as well a £25,000 silver statue from the Household Cavalry barracks in Knightsbridge and £7,000 worth of silver cutlery from Redford Cavalry and Infantry Barracks near Edinburgh.

Dr Andrew Murrison, defence minister, said: 'The Ministry of Defence takes detecting and deterring fraud and theft seriously and set up a new counter fraud and loss department last year to improve the way fraud and theft is managed across defence.

'The aim being to minimise the losses from the defence budget from fraud, misappropriation and theft and thereby maximise the amount spent on our armed forces.'
