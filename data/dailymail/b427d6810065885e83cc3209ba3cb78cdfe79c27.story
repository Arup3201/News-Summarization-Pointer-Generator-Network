Sam Burgess is still at least six weeks away from kick-starting his Bath career, according to head coach Mike Ford.

Burgess' arrival in Bath could now be delayed by a month, after the England rugby league international's successful surgery to repair a shattered cheekbone and eye socket.

The 25-year-old suffered the nasty injury in the opening exchange of South Sydney Rabbitohs' first NRL Grand Final victory in 43 years.

Burgess played through the pain in his last rugby league clash before joining Bath, to lead South Sydney to 30-6 victory over the Canterbury Bulldogs.

Bath told Burgess to take as long as he needs recuperating in Sydney after surgery, but now Ford expects him to arrive in the west country in the next month.

"He's had the operation and we're now figuring out a time for him to come over," said Ford, after Bath's 29-22 Aviva Premiership defeat at Wasps.

"So it will be two to four weeks for his arrival, and yes probably six weeks roughly for a playing return."

Bath's big-money capture Burgess was aiming to arrive in the city on October 15 on order to get acclimatised period to rugby union.

The line-breaking talent is still viewed as a wildcard option for England's Rugby World Cup 2015 bid, with head coach Stuart Lancaster keeping tabs on his progress.

Bath will aim to throw Burgess into initial action in the centres, with England viewing his game-breaking talents as best suited to midfield too.

Bath boss Ford wants to employ Burgess in the back-row in the long-run however, and his conversion to union continues to attract many observers with vested interests.

Bath are adamant they will not rush Burgess' conversion, but Ford already admitting his cheekbone injury could prove a blessing in disguise.
