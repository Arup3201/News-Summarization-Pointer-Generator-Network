Judge: Constance Briscoe is to be charged with two counts of intending to pervert the course of justice

One of Britain’s best known woman judges was charged with perverting the course of justice yesterday over the Chris Huhne speeding affair.

Constance Briscoe, 56, is accused of lying in statements to Essex Police. The barrister and part-time judge was a friend and neighbour of Vicky Pryce, the disgraced Lib Dem politician’s ex-wife.

Prosecutors accuse Briscoe of misleading police by falsely claiming she had no dealings with the Press. She faces charges of providing inaccurate statements to detectives and altering a copy of a witness statement before claiming it was correct.

Briscoe, who has been suspended from the judiciary pending the investigation, vowed to clear her name.

In a statement, she said: ‘I am deeply distressed at the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service to charge me today. I have not committed the offences alleged and I will fight the allegations in court.

'There is a great deal more I would like to say but I have been advised that I should not do so at this stage.’

She is  due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London on June 24.

Both Pryce and former Energy Secretary  Huhne received eight-month sentences after it emerged that she had taken speeding points for her former husband a decade ago.

Huhne pleaded guilty on the first day of a planned joint trial in February, and economist Pryce was later convicted by a jury.

The barrister, who hit the headlines in 2008 when her mother sued her over claims made in her 'misery memoir' Ugly, was arrested on October 2012 and suspended by the Office of Judicial Complaints.

The first count alleges that, between May
2011 and last October, she provided police with two statements that 
were inaccurate. The
second alleges that on October 6 she produced a copy of her witness 
statement that had been altered and maintained that it was the correct 
version.

Crown Prosecution Service senior lawyer Deborah Walsh said: ‘We have today authorised the Kent and Essex Police serious crime directorate to charge Constance Briscoe with two counts of intending to pervert the course of public justice.

‘The first allegation is that, between 
May 16 2011 and October 6 2012, Constance Briscoe provided Essex Police 
with two statements which were inaccurate.

'We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction'

‘The second allegation, dated October 6 
2012, is that Constance Briscoe produced a copy of a witness statement 
that had been altered and that she maintained was the correct version.

‘This decision was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that these charges are in the public interest. Constance Briscoe will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on June 24.'

A judicial press office spokesman 
said: 'The Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor have suspended 
Constance Briscoe from the judiciary pending the outcome of the police 
investigation into the allegations against her.'
