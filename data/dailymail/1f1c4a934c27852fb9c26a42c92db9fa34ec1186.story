Now that recreational pot-smoking has been legalized in Colorado, a sushi restaurant there has decided to pair marijuana with meals in the same way that more traditional establishments will match food to wine.

The suggestions appear on a menu that will be used for an advertising campaign for the Hapa Sushi chain, which has four outlets in Colorado.

It suggests that Pakistani Kush should be enjoyed with pakalolo shrimp and that Purple Rain is perhaps best suited to poke don.

Lovers of honey miso salmon, it proposes, might like to inhale some sour og in between mouthfuls.Katsu curry, meanwhile, goes with blue dream.

The menu was dreamt up with the help of advertising agency TDA Boulder.

Colorado and Washington are the first two states with legalized recreational marijuana, and Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon will allow medical cannabis shops to open in 2014.

Washington's recreational weed will go on sale later this year.

Pot promises to be such big business that advocates are planning voter initiatives for legalizing recreational use in several other states by 2016.

As Colorado comes close to the end of its first week of legally selling recreational marijuana stores under revolutionary new state laws, official sales figures and profit margins have started rolling in.

'Adult use' pot is projected to be a $208 million industry in Colorado this year - on top of the $250 million projected to be spent on medical marijuana, Betty Aldworth, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CNN.

One business alone, the Lodo Wellness Center in Denver, which is described as a 'boutique' marijuana store that is cash-only, recorded $10,000 in sales in the first few hours of Wednesday.Â
