Alan Pardew revealed he quit Newcastle United because of the financial constraints placed on him by owner Mike Ashley.

Pardew said: ‘Newcastle is a big club, it’s difficult because it is run on a tight financial margin. We had to work hard on transfers, the funds for a club that size makes it difficult to understand that we had to build slowly.

‘I am under no illusions - the football community and there was a concern about it. It was the right time for Newcastle but this was my decision.

‘Steve Parish met the clause in my contract and I hope this is the right decision.

‘Four years under that monetary situation, along with the history, made it difficult. I have left it with a good base of players.

‘I want to thank all Geordies. My resilience and character has grown because of the nature of the club.’

Pardew is now Palace manager and he insists success this season will be judged on keeping the team in the Barclays Premier League.

He added: ‘The most important welcome was from the staff and the players. They have told me what the need and that information is important.

‘The players have a tremendous attitude. We have a tough challenge, we are in the bottom three with 18 games to go.

‘Our home form is not good and we have to change that. The players need a lift, maybe a signing or two could do that.

‘Realistically one place above relegation would be success. We need between 35-40 points to stay up.

‘There is a feeling among the players that they can do it. We need that belief to start with.

‘The chairman and the board are keen to bring a player or two and they are working hard towards that. It is complicated in the Premier League, especially to sign a striker.

'We need funding and he gave me some assurances that it would be there.'

Palace next face in form Tottenham, who are currently fifth in the Premier League, but Pardew is hoping a raucous Selhurst Park can help: ‘When you are fighting relegation you don’t want to play teams in red hot form. They are. The place will be jumping and we need to exploit that.’

Pardew joined Palace with the club in the relegation zone and is adamant he can turn it around: 'I had one year of it at Charlton and we struggled one year at Newcastle because we were in the Europa League.

‘I am going to try to change our style a little bit, but it won’t happen quickly.

‘I don't think any Palace fan would stop me dreaming of a club where I thought we could win trophies with a difficult situation and a difficult agenda.

‘I want to prove that I am a top manager in this division. It would have been easier to stay at Newcastle and get a top ten finish. I have decided to take this challenge.

'I don’t think any Newcastle can hold it against me - some thought we had an opinion that we did well with what we had.

‘What I know is that on day one I have 99.9 per cent of the Palace fans but it won’t last long if we do not serve up the best possible football we can. That is what I am going to try to do.

‘I won’t do a lap of honour to try to get the fans going, but I want to see something different.'

Pardew has spoken to Palace winger Jason Puncheon regarding an incident at the PDC World Darts Championships at Alexandra Palace at the weekend, revealed by Sportsmail columnist Charles Sale, when Barry Bannan had to restrain his team mate from a confrontation with fans. 

'We have had an incident this week with Jason Puncheon and I have reminded him that he has a responsibility as a Crystal Palace player. 

'His behaviour was inappropriate and I have told him that. We have some fantastic role models in the Premier League.'

With the transfer window open, many clubs could be interested in Palace winger Yannick Bolasie who has been in fine form for the Eagles this season but Pardew dismissed any move: 'It would take an extraordinary bid to take him away from this football club given the situation we are currently in.'
