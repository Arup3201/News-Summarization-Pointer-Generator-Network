Police say one suspect is in custody, but they are currently searching for a second, who is described as armed and dangerous.

Residents in parts of South Central Los Angles have been warned to stay indoors, while a manhunt involving about 100 officers takes place.

According to CNN, the two officers returned returned fire and were not injured. Police have since recovered two weapons, including a rifle.

In a separate incident in Pasco County, Florida, a suspect fired three bullets toward two sheriff's deputies as they were sitting in their cars on Sunday morning.

'Both deputies reported hearing the whizzing sound of each projectile as they flew by,' the sheriff's office said. 'Deputies did not see the suspect or the vehicle from which the shots were fired.

'Area residents also heard the three gunshots and reported seeing a small, dark-colored vehicle with tinted windows in the area at the time of the shooting.' 

The incidents come just over a week after two NYPD officers were shot dead in Brooklyn while sitting in their patrol car by a man who said he was avenging the killing of unarmed black men by police. 

Pasco County Sheriff's Office have  asked for help from the public in connection with a graffiti message painted on a road barrier that read: 'Shoot MP Cop'

Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were killed in broad daylight by gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, who then turned his weapon on himself.

In the days after their deaths graffiti reading 'kill the cops' was found on the streets of Brooklyn as cops searched for suspects threatening police safety. 

Pasco County Sheriff's Office have also asked for help from the public  in connection with a graffiti message - painted on a road barrier in a subdivision called Meadow Point - that read: 'Shoot MP Cop'.

Sheriff Chris Nocco told Bay News 9: 'Our deputies deserve to be safe and our family members deserve to have their loved ones come home at the end of the shift.

'We're going to come out in force and we are not going to apologize.

'We are not going to be politically correct. We are going to do what is right.'
