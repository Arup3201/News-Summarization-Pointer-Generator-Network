David Cameron today admitted he will have to apologise to the Queen again for claiming she 'purred' when Scots rejected independence.

He also revealed he 'contemplated' having to quit as Prime Minister if people in Scotland had voted Yes.

In an interview he said he watched the results of the historic referendum with his son Ewen on his lap wearing tartan pyjamas, feeling 'saddened' about the prospect of separation. 

Prime Minister David Cameron today admitted that he will have to apologise to the Queen (left, pictured today outside Crathie Kirk in Aberdeenshire) again for revealing details of his conversations over the Scotland result

Mr Cameron was left red-faced after being caught on camera revealing details of his conversations with the Queen. 

On a visit to New York last week, the PM was filmed boasting to former mayor Michael Bloomberg about the call he made to the Queen at Balmoral.

As the Prime Minister and Mr Bloomberg arrived for a press photo-opportunity, Mr Cameron smiled broadly as he recalled how he was able to tell the Queen it was 'all right' after the referendum resulted in a victory for the No camp.

'The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying 'Your Majesty, it is all right, it's okay',' Mr Cameron said.

'That was something. She purred down the line.'

Today Mr Cameron vowed 'never again' to discuss his conversations with the Queen after being challenged whether he was ashamed to have been overheard saying she had 'purred' when told the result of the Scottish independence referendum. 

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: '(It is) one of those moments when you look back and kick yourself very hard.

'It was not a conversation I should have had, I am extremely sorry and very embarrassed about it.

'I have made my apologies and I think I'll probably be making some more.'

In an extraordinary sequence, David Cameron was today heard talking about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the vote

Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state

In the video recording, David Cameron can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: 

'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something....

'She purred down the line...

'But it should never have been that close.

'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt…

'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through.

'It was very nervous moments.'

Asked if he felt ashamed, the Prime Minister added: 'I'm very sorry about it... I'm not going to ever discuss my conversations with the Palace ever again.'

Downing Street has already contacted Buckingham Palace to offer the Prime Minister's apologies and it is understood that Mr Cameron will say sorry in person when he next meets Her Majesty for one of his regular audiences. 

After a bitter two-year campaign, 55 per cent of people in Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom.

It mean that First Minister Alex Salmond resigned, announcing hours after the result was declared that he would be stepping down in November.

In the run-up to the vote Mr Cameron repeatedly denied he would not resign if voters backed independence, insisting they should not use the result as a chance to 'give the effing Tories a kick'.

However, in an interview on the eve of the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron revealed he did have doubts about whether he could remain in office if he was the PM who oversaw the break-up of the UK. 

He told the Sun on Sunday, said he would have been 'heartbroken' by the break-up of the UK and first considered his position when polls put the Yes campaign ahead just days before the referendum.

The extraordinary remarks were picked up as Mr Cameron went on a walkabout at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York, with the city's former mayor Michael Bloomberg

Mr Cameron also vowed to 'sue' polling companies who suggested the Yes campaign was ahead in the referendum campaign, claiming the worry had given him 'stomach ulcers'

Mr Cameron said: 'I thought about resigning because I care so passionately about this issue. If the vote had been for Scotland to have left the UK, I genuinely would have been heartbroken. I would have felt winded and wounded.

'Emotionally, one would have thought, 'I'm so saddened by this. I find it difficult to go on'.'

'Of course, I contemplated having to go. I thought, 'What's the right thing to do?' In many ways the easiest thing would be to say, 'I feel wounded by this' and walk away. I'm sure it would have been absolutely awful.

'In the end I came to the conclusion that would not have been the right thing to do.

Since the referendum he has faced calls to honour pledges for more devolution to Scotland and also consider allowing only English MPs to vote on English legislation.
