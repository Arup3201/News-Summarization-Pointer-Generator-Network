A Jewish couple have created a Hanukkah-based alternative to popular Christmas tradition, the Elf on the Shelf, calling their version The Mensch on the Bench.

Neal and Erin Hoffman, from Cincinnati, Ohio, came up with the idea after seeing how envious their son Jacob was of all his friends who were able to partake in the the increasingly-popular Elf on the Shelf customs. 

Eager to create a Jewish alternative to the festive toy based around their own religious traditions, the couple designed Moshe the Mensch.

Embracing tradition: The couple wanted to teach their son more about his own religion, while embracing their own unique Hanukkah traditions

'ELF ENVY. That is what started this whole thing,' Neal wrote on the couple's Kickstarter page, through which they managed to raise more than $22,000 to fund the project.

'Our son Jacob wanted to be like many of his friends and get an Elf on a Shelf, but being Jewish, the answer was no. That got us thinking. 

'The Elf on a Shelf is a new tradition... So why couldn't we, as Jews, add a new tradition to our holiday to add some more Funukkah to Hanukkah.

'We created the story of Moshe the Mensch. Moshe was at the Temple when the Maccabees returned victorious from the war. Judah Maccabee was exhausted from the fighting and he wanted to go to bed.

The best of friends: Many Elf on the Shelf fans have already added a Mensch on the Bench to their collection and are documenting the characters' friendship on Instagram

'But, with only enough oil left for one night, Judah was worried the lights would go out in the middle of the night. Moshe volunteered to sit on the bench of the Temple and tell everyone if the lights went out. What a Mensch sitting on that Bench.'

Since reaching their funding goal in May last year, the Neal, a former Hasbro Toys employee, and Erin have already expanded The Mensch on a Bench range, which now includes a limited edition Moshe doll and a five foot stuffed Moshe, which has surprisingly  proved to be fairly popular with customers.

Unlike Santa's scout elves, who return to the North Pole every night in order to report back on their children's behavior, the Mensch remains with the family in order to watch over their Menorah throughout the night to ensure that the flames keep burning bright.

Each Mensch comes complete with a book documenting the story of Moshe the Mensch, and a set of eight rules for the family to follow in the weeks leading up to their Hanukkah celebration.

Enjoying some festive fun: Just like the Elf on the Shelf, Moshe the Mensch enjoys capturing his nighttime antics on camera so that he can share them with the family come morning

Midnight mission: Unlike Santa's scout elves, Moshe the Mensch remains in the house all night in order to watch over the family's Menorah and ensure it keeps burning until morning

'Every day of Hanukkah, make sure you give your Mensch a Shamash candle to hold... and every night use that candle to light your Menorah,' one rule reads, while another adds: 'One night of Hanukkah don't open presents yourself, instead buy presents and give them to people in need. 

'Remember that a true Mensch is one who puts smiles on other people's faces.'

Much like fans of the Elf on the Shelf, the Mensch's followers are also encouraged to document their doll's various escapades around the house and then share the images on Instagram using the hashtag #menschonabench.

Thus far, the Mensch has been captured in a number of hilarious positions, from sledding down a makeshift mountain with his Christmas counterpart, the Elf on the Shelf, to enjoying a potato sack race against computer game heroes Mario and Luigi. 

In one image, the religious figure is even seen enjoying a bottle of red wine.

Naughty or nice? Some of the images of Moshe the Mensch are slightly more mischievous than others

And it's not just Jewish families who Neal and Erin hope will enjoy the new Hanukkah tradition. #

'The product is designed for young Jewish families, but is a great introduction to Hanukkah for those not of the Jewish faith,' the couple wrote on their Kickstarter page.

'In the end our goal is to increase active participation in Hanukkah and make the celebration of the holiday even more fun than it is today. 

'We also want to teach kids what it is to be a true Mensch and teach them to strive to make a positive difference in the world around them.
