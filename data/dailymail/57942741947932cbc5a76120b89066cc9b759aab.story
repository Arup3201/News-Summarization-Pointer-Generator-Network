A prolific actor throughout his illustrious career, Robin Williams had a number of movie projects at different stages of development at the time of his tragic suicide on Monday.

The 63-year-old actor had recently completed several films, including a third movie in the Night At The Museum series, which will undoubtedly now have heightened interest in them following his sad demise.

Other projects, such as a mooted sequel to the 1993 hit comedy Mrs Doubtfire, were in the early stages of development and ‘most likely won’t go ahead,’ reports Variety.
