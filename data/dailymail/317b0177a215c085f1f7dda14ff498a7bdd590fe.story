A Russian man caught trying to smuggle two exotic birds from China to Singapore in his trousers claimed he was trying to protect them from the smog.

Nahum Pokrovskii, 43, was caught boarding a plane at Guangzhou airport with the birds in his trousers.

He was arrested after customs officials spotted a bulge and discovered two birds hidden behind white cloth sewn into the lining of his trousers.

China has become renowned for suffering from air pollution following a huge surge in industrial activity in recent years, as well as poor 
pollution controls.

Authorities have invested in various projects to fight pollution, but none has worked so far.

In
 Shanghai the smog has been so severe recently that flights have been 
diverted, schools closed and authorities left mulling whether to 
distribute gas masks to the mega-cityâ€™s residents.

The news comes after it was reported last week that a man was arrested in Cuba for attempting to board a flight to America with 66 birds sewn inside his trousers.

He was seized at Ignacio Agramonte International Airport in the Cuban city of Camaguay and was picked up because of the curious bulges in his trousers.

After being stopped by customs, the man claimed he was concealing a pigeon as a gift for his grandson.

China's huge surge in industrial activity in recent years, as well as poor pollution controls, has led to many areas being affected by air pollution. Picture shows tourists wearing masks in Beijing

But
 after he was forced to remove his trousers, officers found dozens of 
'frightened little finches and hummingbirds' - some with their beaks 
sealed shut so they would not be heard singing.

All the birds were rare species and had probably been stolen to order for the equivalent of thousands of pounds, police said.

The trade in endangered species worldwide is climbing.

Two weeks ago in Germany, a man was stopped at Frankfurt Airport en-route to Spain with 99 rare tortoises, lizards and snakes wrapped in sticky tape in his suitcase.
