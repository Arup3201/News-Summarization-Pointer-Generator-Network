John Moffatt, 85, was found guilty of sexual assault on two teenage staff at Tesco

An 85-year-old shopper repeatedly hugged and groped the breasts of two female Tesco workers while asking where he could find groceries.

John Moffatt, who was found guilty of sexual assault, claimed although he 'caressed' his victims' breasts his behaviour was not sexual.

But a judge told the former sheet metal worker: 'Touching a breast is not something you do to strangers.'

Moffatt had targeted two teenage employees, one who he sexually assaulted three times and her colleague, who he sexually assaulted once at the Tesco in Rossendale, Lancashire.

Burnley Magistrates Court heard Moffatt had asked the first worker for a hug and had then groped her, before following her around the store. He then waited at the door when she went into the office to try and get away from him.

He persisted, returning to the shop the next day and touching another woman on her waist, after putting his hand inside her unzipped jacket. He had asked her: 'Was it you I was talking to yesterday?'

Moffatt, who had been filmed in the store on its CCTV, was caught just over a week later, when he went back into the shop.

The hearing was told Moffatt, who is now suffering from prostate cancer, accepted he had touched the victims, but insisted it was not sexual.

He claimed he was 'more or less being friendly'.

The defendant, of Newchurch, Rossendale, denied four counts of sexual assault on a female on November 21 and 22, but was found guilty by District Judge David Scanlon, who adjourned the case for pre- sentence reports.Â 

The judge, who said Moffatt would not face a prison term, said: 'I don't want this to be the start of something.'

Moffatt had no previous convictions.

Giving evidence, the first victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was filling shelves when Moffatt asked where the long-life milk was.

She said she took him to another aisle and as they crossed the bakery section, he asked for a hug and touched her left breast.

The teenager said: 'I was quite scared and shocked. I didn't know what had happened really. I was just panicked by it. I just carried on walking him to where the milk was, because I was in shock.

'I said I was going back to my department and he said: "Wait, I will walk back with you." I just waited for him because I didn't know what to do.'

She said Moffatt then started to put his arm around her waist and moved her arm to put it around him.

When the defendant said he needed another product, the victim said she couldn't help him and went into the office. Moffatt waited at the door for her.

When she returned to the shop floor, Moffatt appeared again, went to hug her and stroked her breast again. She said: 'Obviously, I was more scared then.'

The court heard the store's duty manager reported the incident to the police.

The victim said: 'I had no physical injuries, but it's made me extremely wary around people. It affected my work at first and I'm just a quite paranoid person now.'

The court heard that the fourth sexual assault happened the following day.

Kristian Cavanagh, for Moffatt, said the defendant accepted he hugged the first woman, was embarrassed about it and accepted he should not have done so.

Moffatt told the court he accepted touching her breast, but said it was 'more of a caress'.

He said: 'There was no intention of any sex whatsoever. It never crept into my mind at all. I was more or less being friendly.'

District Judge Scanlon said of the victims: 'I believe them both implicitly, both in terms of what they say you did and the way it made them feel.'

He said he had been struck by the defendant's use of the word caress. He said: 'Caress, to me, is a word that automatically has a sexual connotation.

'Touching a breast is something that people do who have an intimate relationship with each other, or potentially would like an intimate relationship with each other, not to strangers.

'I don't want there to be a repetition of this.'
