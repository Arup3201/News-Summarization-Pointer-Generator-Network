A Brooklyn tailor who survived the Holocaust has revealed how he came inches away from assassinating a senior Nazi's wife - but his conscience saved him from stooping to the level of the SS.

Martin Greenfield, 84, is a New York-based tailor to the rich and famous who has been altering suits for decades, with a host of celebrity clients from the music, sports and political arenas.

It was a life he never saw coming seven decades ago, when he was locked up in Buchenwald prison camp, doubting he would make it past the age of 16.

And in his new memoir Measure Of A Man, Greenfield describes the harrowing day that he was freed - and debated seeking bloody revenge on his torturers.

Faced with firing a bullet at the mayor of Weimar's wife, who ordered for him to be beaten, Greenfield could not pull the trigger.

Instead, he leapt in her black Mercedes, invited two German girls to join him, and drove gleefully through the gates of the defunct camp under the then ironic sign: 'To each what he deserves'.

Months before, he had been doing repairs at Buchenwald when he came across a broken chicken pen, and to his surprise found a pair of rabbits still alive quivering inside.

Next to them, a starving Greenfield noticed some browning lettuce the two pets had left.

He started to eat it - and was caught by the mayor or Weimar's wife, who ordered for him to be beaten.

Survivor: He was released from Buchenwald aged 16 and headed straight to the home of the mayor's wife

'I couldn't do it': He pointed the gun at the woman's chest as she held a baby but his conscience kicked in

Instead, he took her Mercedes and drove it - with two German girls - through the gates of Buchenwald 

Her cruelty struck a nerve.

He writes: 'How could a woman carrying her own child find a walking skeleton saving her pets and have him beaten for nibbling on rotten animal food? I thought.

'In that moment, my numbness to death melted. In its place rose an alien blood lust, a hunger for vengeance unlike any I had ever known. The surge of adrenaline and rush of rage felt good inside my withered frame.

'Then and there I made a vow to myself: If I survived Buchenwald, I would return and kill the mayor’s wife.'

At 3.15pm on April 11, 1945, he set out to fulfill his vow.

He grabbed machine guns and two sidekicks and headed straight for the mayor's home.

They crept inside.

'The beautiful blond woman turned the corner and let out a screech. She had the baby in her arms again,' Greenfield recounts in an exclusive extract published by the New York Post.

'I aimed the machine gun at her chest. The baby wailed. My finger hovered above the trigger.'

But when the moment came, he couldn't.

'That was the moment I became human again. All the old teachings came rushing back. I had been raised to believe that life was a precious gift from God, that women and children must be protected.'

He added: 'My moral upbringing would not allow me to become an honorary member of the SS.'

Instead, clad in uniform, he grabbed the car, two girls, and carted into his former prison. 

It was a moment that allowed Greenfield to reconquer his life and move to the States, he explains.

The first shirt he ever touched with a needle and thread belonged to an SS guard who had given it to him to wash.

Honing his sewing skills and fixing the attire to fit him properly, Mr Greenfield used the shirt as a status symbol, wearing it in place of his prison garb.

He had been moved to the Buchenwald camp before he was freed by Allied forces. 

When freed, he was alongside another young prisoner, writer Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel.

Mr Greenfield was 19 years old when he arrived in the U.S. in 1947. Today, he is showing few signs that he is ready to retire.

The Post reported that suits at Greenfield’s Brooklyn headquarters cost anywhere from $1,800 to $2,700.

In the past, Mr Greenfield’s prowess as a tailor has been sought out by some of America’s biggest names, including Paul Newman and Michael Jackson.

But perhaps no name is bigger than the president of the United States.

As a young tailor in the 50s, his bosses gave him the privilege to measure Dwight D. Eisenhower, the same man who shook his hand as a general outside the liberated Buchenwald camp years earlier.

Eisenhower may have been Mr Greenfield’s first president, but he wouldn’t be the last, as Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton also bought suits from him, according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

He had an appointment with President George W. Bush at the White House on September 11, 2001 - a meeting that had to be rescheduled after the terror attacks.

President Obama is likely among Mr Greenfield’s clientele as well, but the humble tailor will not say so, citing a personal policy not to speak about a client unless that client has first spoken of him.

Other clients include other key political figures as Gen Colin Powell, Sen Bob Dole and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
