A father was stunned when he returned to find his car scratched and an abusive note on his windscreen telling him not to park in a 'parents only' space outside a shopping centre.

Adam Scarlett returned to his Toyota Hilux dual-cab ute outside Woolworths in Mona Vale, on Sydney's Northern Beaches, with his three year-old son Willo on Sunday to discover the scrawled letter, lambasting him for not being a 'parent with a pram'.

Although he didn't use a pram, Mr Scarlett held his son's hand and put him in a nearby trolley - enough for him to feel the wrath of a fellow shopper.

Adam Scarlett was shocked to receive this note on his car when he came back from shopping at Woolworths, in Mona Vale, on Sunday

‘You are not a "parent with pram" you lazy f****** t****r,' the note said.

'I have just let your tyres down and scratched your ute. Have a nice day and remember p***!!!'

Mr Scarlett's wife Philippa was so horrified by the incident she decided to post the note on a Facebook page called Northern Beaches Mums Facebook.

‘It left a bitter taste in my mouth,’ she told the MailOnline. ‘I hoped that the woman saw it on the page and felt ashamed.'

Ms Scarlett said her husband believed it was a woman who was waiting to park in the ‘parent with pram space’ next to him and shook her head for having to wait until he got his son out of the car.

'My husband took my son by the hand and walked him over to put him in a trolley,' she said. 'There's no way he would walk around the supermarket for a full grocery shop.’

Even though the tyres were not slashed, Ms Scarlett described the reaction as 'overkill'.

'It doesn't matter whether they had a bad day or not - they must have had nothing better to do' she said.

'We are completely in the right to park there, as far as I’ve been told the parking sign doesn’t mean you have to have a pram in the car - it means you have small children so it's OK to park there to carry them in or put them in a trolley.'

Abusive notes being left on cars parked in ‘parent with pram’ spaces has been an ongoing  problem across Sydney’s northern beaches, she said.

'The issue has come up at least four times this year on the mums' page,' she said.

Two mothers replied to Ms Scarlett’s post saying they had experienced similar experiences.

‘Sounds like the nut job that abused me in Frenchs Forest on Friday. Report her!’  Theresa Amos said.

While Honie Farrington said ‘same thing happen to me but they snapped one of my windscreen wipers off’.
