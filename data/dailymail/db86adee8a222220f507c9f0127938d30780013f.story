A cardiac nurse was shocked into losing 7st in just four months after seeing overweight patients his age admitted to hospital after having heart attacks.

Peter Sariwee, 42, from Lancaster, realised he needed to change his ways after seeing first-hand the health problems an unhealthy diet and lifestyle can cause.

As a result, he dropped from 17st to just 9st 7lbs by revolutionising his diet and taking up running.

Peter Sariwee, a nurse, lost 7st in just four months after being shocked to see patients his age and size being brought to hospital after suffering heart attacks

Mr Sariwee dropped from 17st to 9st 7lbs and lost 10ins from his waist. He went from a size XXL to a small

To lose weight Mr Sariwee took up running and completely revolutionised his diet

Mr Sariwee told MailOnline: ‘When I saw these people being brought in it was upsetting to think it could be me.

‘I missed so much of my life being a couch potato – now I want to make up for it as I finally have my life back.’

Before he went on a diet, Mr Sariwee had been piling on the pounds gradually.

He took no exercise and says he could not even run 100 meters.

He also suffered breathlessness, lethargy and was constantly tired.

He would eat a full English breakfast, two sandwiches and a bag of crisps for lunch and then pizza for dinner.

He also snacked on three or four Mars bars a day as well as crisps and biscuits and drank at least two litres of Coca Cola every day.

Mr Sariwee was also fond of a pint and would have 10 per night on Friday, Saturday and Sunday each week.

BEFORE:

Breakfast: A full English breakfast

Lunch: Two sandwiches and a bag of crisps

Dinner: Pizza

Snacks: Four Mars bars a day, crisps and biscuits

Drinks: Up to 10 pints of beer and two litres of Coca Cola a day

AFTER:

Breakfast: A bowl of bran flakes

Lunch: Just fruit

Dinner: Chicken with salad

Snacks: Dried fruit and nuts

Drinks: Water and only an occasional beer

He eventually decided he had to change his lifestyle after being shocked to see patients the same age and size as him being brought into his hospital with heart problems.

He explained that, as a nurse, he would take their details, including how much they ate, drank and weighed, and realised there were too many parallels between their lives and his.

As a result, in 2010, Mr Sariwee decided to make some drastic changes.

He took up running and has since run 31 marathons, including once running five marathons in five days.

He also gave up chocolate and alcohol completely and started eating healthily.

In just four months he lost 7st to drop to 9st 7lbs.

He also dropped from a 36in waist to a 26in waist and fell from an XXL shirt to a small.

Amazingly, he then decided he had actually gone too far as he started to look gaunt and noticed his cheekbones were protruding.

So, he decided to put a stone back on – he is now happy weighing 10st 7lbs.

Mr Sariwee, who met his wife Lisa during his diet, now has a bowl of bran flakes for breakfast, just fruit for lunch and a jacket potato with baked beans, or chicken with salad for dinner.

Since his weight loss Mr Sariwee has started running marathons and has run 31 to date

Before he lost weight, Mr Sariwee says he could not even run 100m

He snacks on fruit and nuts and just allows himself the occasional chocolate bar or beer.

He says that he initially found his new diet very difficult to stick to as he craved alcohol and chocolate.

However, he says it quickly became easier and that running continues to help him keep the weight off.

He also explained he thinks the key to successful dieting is not to entirely deny oneself anything.

He told MailOnline: ‘My wife has been my rock, she has supported me though everything and she is looking fantastic as she has also lost 2st.

Mr Sariwee says he now feels much fitter and healthier and that he also has more confidence

Mr Sariwee never used to exercise at all but he says he now loves it and is almost addicted

‘I now love running – especially after a stressful shift at work. It helps me clear my head.

‘It has become my stress-reliever. Words can’t explain what it is like to be out watching the sunrise on the fells when no one else is about.’

He added: ‘I feel a lot fitter now and I need much less sleep.

‘I can do all of the things I missed out on before – I feel like I’ve got my life back and I am much more confident.

‘I can now buy the clothes I want and I have the confidence to sit on a beach in just shorts without worrying.’

Mr Sariwee is soon to take part in a 69 mile ultra marathon along Hadrian's Wall

Mr Sariwee says he now hopes to stay at his current weight and intends to avoid weight gain by running

Mr Sariwee says people’s reactions to his sudden weight loss were inspiring.

He explained: ‘I lost the weight so quickly that people have had to do a double take to check it’s really me.’

He added: ‘The best thing about the whole experience has been meeting new running friends – it makes me feel really good and the running is like an addiction now.’

On June 21 Mr Sariwee will be taking part in a 69 mile, 24 hour run along Hadrian’s Wall.

The event is Rat Race’s The Wall Ultra Marathon.
