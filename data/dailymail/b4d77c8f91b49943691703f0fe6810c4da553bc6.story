As a public display of dissension in the ranks, it couldn't have been clearer.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop shook her head, rolled her eyes and finished off with a face palm as Treasurer Joe Hockey gave a bellicose defence of the late Malcolm Fraser's 'great initiative', the Expenditure Review Committee, otherwise known as the expenditure razor gang.

He homed in on the former prime minister's initiative of the ERC, much to the disgust of his front-bench colleague and the mirth of others, including Education Minister Christopher Pyne.

'And of course he was the great initiator of, and we will be forever thankful, the expenditure review committee and that committee has endured much to the chagrin of my colleagues and it is one of his many last legacies,' Mr Hockey announced.

But there was no hiding the Foreign Minister's disbelief.

In just 13 seconds, Ms Bishop rolled her eyes, puffed out her cheeks, threw her head back and then shook her head. She then muttered a word before putting her head in her hand, shaking her head once more before finally raising her eyebrows.

As she recoiled from Mr Hockey's speech, there was a mixed response from Coalition MPs - some laughed, others looked on incredulously - no doubt reacting to further angst in the ranks over proposed budget cuts.

The federal Treasurer was praising Mr Fraser for being the 'great initiator' of what is commonly referred to as the government's razor gang.

The cabinet committee is in charge of finding budget cuts across the government and has in the past taken a blade to the foreign aid budget.

There are reports Ms Bishop is furious at plans by Mr Hockey to announce further cuts to the foreign aid budget in a bid to balance the books.

Ms Bishop earlier said she was not aware of any more cuts and would take the matter up with Mr Hockey.

'I believe we have it about right,' she told reporters in Canberra on Monday.

There have also been reports of concerns among some in the Liberal Party that cabinet members have been deliberately leaking against Ms Bishop to head off her leadership prospects.

There are suggestions there will be a small cut to foreign aid in the May budget on top of the $140 million allotted to "InnovationXchange", a new project focusing on how Australia provides funds to disadvantaged countries, announced by the Foreign Minister.

Treasurer Joe Hockey is set for a showdown with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop over proposed cuts to foreign aid in the May Budget

Of the late Malcolm Fraser, pictured in 1977 on the White House lawns, Joe Hockey stated: 'He was the great initiator of the expenditure review committee and that committee has endured much to the chagrin of my colleagues and it is one of his many last legacies'

The foreign minister said she was not aware of any more budget cuts to foreign aid and would take the matter up with Mr Hockey.

Ms Bishop said while the government's razor gang had not yet considered the $4 billion aid budget, she did not believe there was room for more savings.

'I believe we have it about right,' she told reporters in Canberra.

Ms Bishop challenged opposition MPs to 'look into their hearts' and support the $5 billion in other budget cuts Labor had proposed in government but were now resisting.
