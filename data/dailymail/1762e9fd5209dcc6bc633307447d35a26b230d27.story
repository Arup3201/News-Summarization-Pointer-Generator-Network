Margaret Thatcher has been hailed by Conservatives as Britain’s greatest peacetime Prime Minister.

So it seems a little odd that the Tories are paying tribute to the Iron Lady by selling off an extraordinary array of tat, including mugs, baby grows and tea towels.

The bizarre collection of Tory-branded goods went on sale at the party’s conference in Manchester, ahead of an official tribute to the late leader as part of what has been dubbed ‘Thatcher Day’.

Tribute: Iron Baby baby grows are on sale at the Our Maggie shop during the Tory party conference in Manchester

Baroness Thatcher died in April at the age of 87, sparking a wave of tributes from senior Conservatives.

A 10-minute tribute to the former Prime Minister opened the conference today, followed by a speech from party chairman Grant Shapps drawing heavily on her upbringing as the daughter of a grocer.

But outside the conference hall the spirit of enterprise is alive and well, with the Iron Lady’s image, name and slogans used to sell a wide range of memorabilia.

It includes an ‘Iron Baby’ baby grow costing £15, a £8 bib and t-shirts costing £12 featuring the words: ‘The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of people’s money.

There is also a £7 tea towel with the slogan: ‘You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it.’

However a £25 ironing board cover paying homage to the Iron Lady was mysteriously withdrawn from sale.

David Cameron lead the eulogies in the
10-minute video, called Our Maggie, which featured comments from 
leading Conservative politicians past and present.

On
the weekend Baroness Thatcher's ashes were buried, Mr Cameron said the 
former premier's greatest legacy had been to ‘save our country’.

Delegates
all joined in a prolonged standing ovation at the end of the film which
touched on key Thatcherite policies of encouraging home ownership, 
privatisation and the "export of freedom" in the choice to stand against
the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

The Falklands war was also the focus of a major section of tributes.

Baroness Thatcher died in April and received a Ceremonial Funeral at St Paul's Cathedral, attended by the Queen.

In the film, Mr Cameron said: ‘She was a conviction politician... she did not believe in accepting the consensus.

‘She was a great Conservative because she put Conservative principles into action.

‘She knew it was not enough to debate, to think, to talk - you need to act.

‘That's what she did - she reshaped Britain in a new Conservative mould... she saved our country, that is her true legacy.’

Featured in the film were Chancellor George Osborne, Baroness Thatcher's close friend Conor Burns MP and Conservative MP Priti Patel.

No mug: There is almost no item which has not been branded by the Our Maggie shop, including these £7 mugs

Taking notes: Several Tory politicians have sought to echo Lady Thatcher during their speeches in the main conference hall

Lady Thatcher became MP for Finchley in 1959 and was Conservative prime minister between 1979 and 1990.

Mr Shapps used his speech opening the conference to draw inspiration from Baroness Thatcher’s upbringing.

He told delegates: ‘We’ve been busy making Britain the most attractive place to set up shop. Because make no mistake – it’s this party – once led by a grocer’s daughter – which is and always will be the party of small business.’

Mr Shapps said Baroness Thatcher 
inspired him to set up his own print business. ‘I’ll never forget lying 
awake at night worrying about paying the bills.

‘Or
going to the cinema with friends, only to find out later that I’d 
missed the best bits of the film because I’d been so deep in thought 
worrying about cash flow. There was a constant pressure to bring in 
enough print work to pay the wages at the end of the month. 

‘But
we survived. And as we grew, we took on more employees. Margaret 
Thatcher inspired me and millions of others to set up shop.

‘She never forgot the hard-working people of this country.’

Inspiration: Tory party chairman Grant Shapps, pictured with wife Belinda, used a speech opening the conference to Baroness Thatcher inspired him to start his own print business

Bitter: The Labour party has also been targeted by the Tory party props department, with a range of satirically-labelled beer bottles including Leftie Blond and Extra Strong Union Ale

He went on: 'What a remarkable woman. An exceptional leader. A true Conservative.

'I'm enormously proud to be the Chairman of a party once led by Margaret Thatcher.

'It's a pride in her that we all share in this hall. Shared by the tens-of-thousands who lined the streets of London back in April to show their respect to Britain's first female Prime Minister.

'We're the oldest democratic party in world. We've had many great leaders- we've got one now, and we'll have many more.

'But my friends, I know you'll agree with me when I say there will only ever be one Margaret Thatcher.'
