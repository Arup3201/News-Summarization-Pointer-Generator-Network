Death: Officers visited the home of Amar Khosah, 52, in Southampton when he was reported missing - but simply posted a note through his door

Police failed to find a missing man who was lying dead in his bed for up to 12 days after overdosing on prescription painkillers, an inquest has heard.

Officers visited the home of Amar Khosah, 52, in Southampton when he was reported missing - but simply posted a note through his door. The body was only found when his sister broke in herself.

A coroner said it was possible the man could have been saved had Hampshire Constabulary officers investigated properly, adding: ‘The property could have been entered at any time.’

Police have apologised, saying the officers involved had received ‘refresher training’ but should have checked the flat. They added that the probe was ‘confused’ and ‘limited’ but nobody was disciplined.

Mr Khosah was reported missing on July 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments. Police called at his home several times and posted notes through his door - but never tried to get in.

Family friend Fabian Nicholas told the inquest that Mr Khosah’s sister Simbo had given officers permission to force their way in. But police said there was no record of permission being granted.

The body was discovered on August 4 by his other sister, Amar Sameja, who had returned to her Southampton home from India on July 31. She broke into his flat and found him on his bed.

The inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court comes less than two weeks after the same force apologised for failing deaf pensioner Marion Jones, 89, who dialled 999 after falling at home.

An officer from Hampshire Constabulary visited her home and simply left when she failed to answer the door. She was found dead inside five days later.

'We do have a situation where if the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed'

Coroner Keith Wiseman

Pathologist Dr Sanjay Jogai said Mr Khosah had died from an overdose of prescription painkiller tramadol. He believed the time of death was three to five days before the body was found.

Coroner Keith Wiseman recorded an open verdict, saying it was unclear whether Mr Khosah had taken his own life intentionally or by mistake.

He was critical of the police investigation, saying: ‘The property could have been entered at any time from July 23 onwards.

‘This becomes intriguing because if he 
had not in fact died at that stage then we do have a situation where if 
the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed.’

Hearing: The inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court (pictured) in Hampshire was told that Amar Khosah, 52, was reported missing on July 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments

The Investigations Standards Team and Hampshire Constabulary’s Professional Standards Department reviewed how the case was handled. Both concluded there was ‘confusion among officers’ about the status of Mr Khosah’s disappearance.

'It was clear officers had not applied the force's missing person policy correctly, that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching Mr Khosa’s property earlier'

Superintendent James Fulton, Hampshire Constabulary

The reviews said: ‘Officers did not 
exercise enough urgency. The investigation needed greater continuity and
control. The concerns of the mental health worker should have made 
officers increase the risk factor.’

Superintendent
James Fulton of Hampshire Constabulary said: ‘Once again I wish to 
extend our sympathies to Mr Khosah’s family. I recognise this has been a
very difficult time for them and that they have lost a much-loved 
member of their family.

‘While it cannot be concluded that the investigation, if managed differently, would have led to a different outcome, there is evidence that the investigation could have been concluded sooner if it had been graded appropriately.

Concerns: A coroner said it was possible the 52-year-old could have been saved if officers from Hampshire Constabulary (whose headquarters in Winchester are pictured) had investigated properly

‘It was clear officers had not applied the force’s missing person policy correctly, that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching Mr Khosa’s property earlier.

‘The Professional Standards Department (PSD) investigation concluded that no individual officer or police staff member had a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct.

‘However, following the coroner’s comments, PSD will review further what individual and organisational learning should follow.

‘We have also assured Mr Khosah’s family that all officers involved in this investigation are being spoken to and given refresher training on the problem areas highlighted.

‘The force is reviewing policy to establish clearer guidance on the levels of risk and the correct categories of missing people, establishing clear standards of investigation for attending officers

‘Force training will support the roll-out of the amended policy. The force is determined to learn the lessons of this case and we will incorporate the coroner’s findings into the review of how we deal with missing people in future.’
