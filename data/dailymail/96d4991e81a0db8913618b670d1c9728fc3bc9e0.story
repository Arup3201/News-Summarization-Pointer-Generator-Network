The wife of a steward on board missing flight MH370 found joy today with the birth of a baby boy - an event which has led to congratulations from around the world.

Friends in Malaysia said that while 34-year-old Intan Maizura Othman was sad that her husband was not around to welcome his baby son into the world, the child had brought great happiness to her after weeks of grief.

Her husband, Mohammad Hazrin Hasnan has been missing for 73 days, along with a total of 239 passengers and crew who were on board the Boeing 777 jet which vanished on March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Baby Mohammad was born in Putrajaya Hospital in Malaysiam to Intan Maizura Othman, the wife of a steward who was on board the missing Malaysia airlines flight. She has named the baby Mohammad after her husband

The child had brought great happiness to his 34-year-old mother who is still grieving for her missing husband, Mohammad Hazrin Hasnan who has been unheard of for 73 days

The baby, named Mohammad after his father, was born in Putrajaya Hospital and is the couple's second child.

The delighted mother posted a photo of the baby on Facebook, resulting in an enormous response of 63,000 'likes' in the first three hours.

Earlier, Intan had posted a photo of herself on Instagram as she waited to give birth in the hospital, the New Straits Times reported today.

The baby was the second child for the couple, though it is almost certain that Mohammad Hazrin Hasnan will never meet his young son

As the couple's second child, he received over 63,000 'likes' in the first three hours of his mother posting a photo of him on Facebook

In a moving earlier tribute to her husband after she had accepted that he was not coming back, Intan said on social media that 'my love for you will stay for ever.'

She wrote that 'all that happened is so mysteriously insane, but who am I to question Allah the Almighty.'

Intan said that she would gradually tell Iman, their daughter, that she has 'lost her papa' and their baby will 'be my pillar to move on.'

Their children, she added, would not let him down.

'Remember, I told you I want to be leader of all the Angels in heaven? I'm so jealous now that u r now with them, but never mind, I will join u someday. You are the best husband and papa I could ever ask for.'

Intan paid tribute to her husband on social media, saying that she would gradually tell their daughter that she had 'lost her papa' and that their baby will 'be my pillar to move on'

The happy news came after the brother-in-law of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah broke his silence over allegations the MH370 pilot was in no fit state to fly after his wife left him.

Mr Asuad Khan appeared on ABC's Four Corners to deny rumours that Captain Zaharie had practiced dangerous maneuvers on his home flight simulator.

The 53-year-old pilot has been under intense scrutiny since flight MH370 disappeared March 8, with rumours swirling that his personal life and his political leanings had led to him taking the plane and its unwitting passengers on a suicide mission.

Mr Khan said Zaharie's wife Faisa had not left him, he had not plotted to take the aircraft down and he was not a political activist who had attended a court hearing of an opposition leader who'd been sentenced to prison.

Malaysia said it will publicly release satellite data used to narrow down the search for the missing jetliner to the southern Indian Ocean on Tuesday.

The Civil Aviation Department and British company Inmarsat in a joint statement said they would do this 'in line with our commitment to greater transparency'.

The news comes after some family members of the 239 people on the plane demanded raw satellite data to be made public for independent analysis.

The government says calculations using Inmarsat data showed Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 veered off course and ended in the Indian Ocean after it went missing on March 8.

No wreckage has been found and Australia continues to lead the underwater hunt.

Authorities believe the plane was flown deliberately off course but are still investigating the cause of the disappearance.

'In moving forward, it is imperative for us to provide helpful information to the next of kin and general public, which will include the data communication logs as well as relevant explanation to enable the reader to understand the data provided,' the statement said.

It stressed the data was just one of many elements in the investigation but didn't say when or how it will be released.

Malaysia has been criticized for its handling of the crisis, especially by relatives of Chinese passengers who make up the majority on board the plane.

Earlier this month, family members urged Malaysia, China and Australia to review Inmarsat data for its accuracy.

In a letter to the countries' leaders, which is also posted on their Facebook page, the relatives said the data did not 'support a definitive conclusion that no other flight path was possible'.

'We feel that it is necessary that the data be subject to independent third-party review. It is our hope that with out of box thinking, the whole world can help to look for the plane,' the letter said.

The search has moved into a new phase, with a Chinese navy survey ship to start mapping the seabed off the west Australian coast this week.

Meanwhile, it was also revealed yesterday that the audio recordings of the 'ping' signals believed to

have come from the black box of Flight MH370 will now not be released as doubt grows over whether they are connected with the missing plane.

The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) headed by Angus Houston told the Herald Sun that the search group's original confidence the four accoustic 'ping' signals were from the plane had waned and the recordings would not be made public.

'The recordings of the detections will not be released at this point in time,' the JACC said.

'We continue to pursue this lead to either discount or confirm the area of the detections as the final resting place of MH370.'

Asuad Khan, brother of the MH370 pilot Captain Zaharie said the accusations that his brother-in-law had crashed the plane on purpose were unjustified
