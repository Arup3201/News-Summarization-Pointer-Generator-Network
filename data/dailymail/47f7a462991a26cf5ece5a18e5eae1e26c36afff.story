Most people couldn't recall what row they were sitting in on a plane they boarded three years ago but a Brisbane couple have very good reason to remember every detail of the flight.

Holly and Tim Moffitt sat next to each other in row 4 on a Virgin flight from Brisbane to Canberra on April 7 in 2011.

During the two-hour trip, the strangers talked endlessly and exchanged contact details to meet again and the rest, as they say, is history.

Holly's stepfather, Dean White, thought it would be a fitting gesture to ask Virgin Australia to write a letter congratulating them on their wedding day on October 25 this year - but the airline company went above and beyond this special request.

A thoughtful video was produced with staff members from all departments getting involved to congratulate the Brisbane couple.

Staff members, Louise and Sarah, start the string of touching messages with Sarah saying: 

'Who would’ve thought all of those years ago when you sat in row 4 as complete strangers that it was meant to be – have a great day.' 

Then the video goes into the cockpit of the plane with Captain Chris Hartley who was joined by Officer Daniel Lloyd.

'We hope the fastened seat belt isn’t switched on or too often for any turbulence throughout your relationship – we wish you a smooth and enjoyable ride,' Officer Lloyd said.

Baggage handlers, Andrew and Nathan, gave their own piece of advice: 'Whilst we deal with baggage every day - to avoid that baggage make sure you clearly communicate to one another and have a fantastic and loving and long marriage.'

The video ends with Louise and Sarah toasting their glasses of bubbles to the happy couple.

They couldn't have known stepping onto the plane all those years ago that their lives would be changed forever

Mr White said the footage received an rousing response at the wedding reception at Tweed Heads in Northern NSW - particularly from the overwhelmed couple.

'They were blown away, and really appreciated the efforts of those involved,' he said. 'Everyone at the reception cheered and applauded.' 

Even though Mr white had discussed the video with Virgin in the week and a half leading up to the wedding, he did no expect great footage,

'We were really impressed by the extra distance mile that Virgin Australia had gone to, especially as it started out as a reasonably small request for a congratulation letter to read out at the reception,' he said.

'When we watched it we knew that everyone would love it.'

The couple could never have known stepping onto that plane all those years ago - when Holly was jetting off to visit her parents while Tim was heading to a family wedding - that their lives would be changed forever.

Mr White said when his daughter arrived in Canberra she was clearly smitten with the stranger she had been chatting to for the past couple of hours.

'She could not stop telling us about the great guy she had met on the flight,' he said.

The couple's starkly different personalities made them a compatible match.  

'Let’s just say they were keen on each other from the start,' Mr White said. 'They are polar opposites which completely complement each other.

But the fairytale doesn't end there - the couple will return from their honeymoon in India to be told Virgin has offered them return flights to anywhere in Australia.
