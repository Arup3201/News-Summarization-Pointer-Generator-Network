The victim's head was brutally cut off and shown resting on the back of the severed neck. Their bodies were left unburied somewhere near Raqqa.

It is unclear when the men were executed but it is thought that the atrocity was carried out earlier this week. 

The photos show a large group of Islamic State militants, dressed in military fatigues and carrying weapons, standing in a circle.

Forced into the middle of the circle by one of the fighters, the victims are shown blindfolded with their hands tied behind their back.

Two IS fighters are shown holding up a large black banner, adorned with the Islamic State logo. 

Unusually, no local residents can be seen watching the executions, suggesting the savage execution was carried out secretly, away from the main city.

Forced to kneel in the arid dirt, the two alleged spies are shown being shot in the back of the head by an IS fighter, wearing a black balaclava.

A closeup action shot of the gunshot was also released, highlighting Islamic State's keenness to boast about its war crimes. 

The final photo shows one of the bodies of the deceased lying on top of a mount of earth, possibly a freshly filled grave.

The accused punishment was read out over a megaphone by a local IS fighter, informing the crowd that all Muslims are forbidden from drinking alcohol.

The punishment was carried out in the Syrian city of Deir ez-Zor, renamed by Islamic State as al-Kheir.

Islamic State has also continued to enforce its barbaric region in eastern city of Deir-ezzor. The Islamist group published photos showing a man being publicly whipped for drinking wine.

The punishment was carried out in front of a large crowd of local men and children. Few IS fighters appear to be witnessing the event, which was carried out in the centre of the city.

Islamic State has become well known for its cruel punishment for anyone who refuses to adhere to their radical interpretation of Shariah law.
