The scene of the crime: A man was carjacked in broad daylight yesterday morning on Christopher street between Bleecker and Hudson in Manhattan's West Village

The New York Daily News reports that the carjacker threatened the man with his revolver and yelled, 'Back up!' before getting into the truck.  

The suspect drove off without firing a shot towards the West Side Highway three blocks away, reported The New York Times.

Gothamist reports that the suspect was wearing a brown jacket, black pants, and a red hat.

CBS spoke to Scott Smith, a man whose salon window faces the crime scene. He reports that he didn't hear anything.

'We keep the doors locked. I was sitting in here counting money, ironically enough,' Scott Smith said.

'That’s incredibly concerning,' said Christopher Street resident Adam Masry to CBS. 'Even in the harshest of weather, I guess people are brazen,' he continued.

Police were not yet able to find the suspect or the stolen car. The snowy weather has made getting around the city more difficult than usual.
