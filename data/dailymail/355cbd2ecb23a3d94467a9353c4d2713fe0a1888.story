A schoolboy has landed a catch of a lifetime - a monstrous 8ft catfish  weighing the same as a champion boxer.

The carnivorous catfish had snatched the live bait from 14-year-old Sam Lee's line who was on a fishing holiday in Spain with his father Peter.

Weighing in at 208lb, similar to that of boxing champion David Haye, it was never going to be an easy battle to pull him in.

The giant catfish, which weighs a staggering 208lb and is 2.6 metres long, dwarfs Sam  after he caught the monster on a fishing holiday in Spain

The giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream, but Sam, from Chester, hung on. And finally, after a 35 minute battle, Sam finally landed the 15 stone, 2.5 metre-long fish.

In time honoured tradition, he then posed for the traditional photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia.

His father Peter: 'Sam certainly hit the jackpot with that monster! He was exhausted but ecstatic after the fish was eventually landed, weighed and photographed. It was safely returned to the river and swam away in good health.'

Sam fought for more than half an hour to land the fish after it snatched the live bait on the end of his line but was eventually able to catch it and pose for a traditional photo

Sam, who attends Upton High School, has loved fishing for years and his latest catch is the biggest yet. He landed a 133lb catfish on the same stretch of river during a holiday last year and never expected to beat that. 

But he quickly hooked a 133lb fish this time before feeling the tug of the 208lb fish on the end of his line later on.

Peter, who hooked a rare albino catfish weighing 116lb, said they had 'an amazing few days' fishing.

'This was his third trip to the Ebro in search of giant catfish.

'The big one took 35 minutes to land and Sam had to be taken out in a boat by the guide from the swim to play and land it as it stripped 100m of line on its first big run. Sam did brilliantly to land it.'

Earlier this year an eight foot 260lb Wels catfish was caught in Italy by angler Dino Ferrari on the River Po in Italy. But the European catch to beat is the Guinness World Record of 297lbs, 9 oz.

But the biggest on record is the Mekong catfish, found in Southeast Asia, which was recorded as  8ft 9in long and just a sliver under 646 pounds.
