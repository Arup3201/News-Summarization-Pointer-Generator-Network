 Sherm is a joint or cigarette dipped in liquid PCP, a hallucinatory substance. 

A detective told the court that Dorsey had accelerated in his white pick-up truck when he saw the young woman walking across the parking lot. 

Dorsey had hit three cars on the interstate before driving into the parking lot, according to KATV.

Surveillance showed that he entered the parking lot at the same speed he was driving on the interstate. 

Sgt Todd Crowson told the station: 'It's a horrific video, and you just hate to see what this young lady went through.'

A Target employee called 911 on seeing the horrific hit-and-run, before following the truck to  apartments nearby. Dorsey was arrested soon afterwards.

Dorsey appeared in court on Thursday morning where he was held on $1million bail. 

Two days before the hit-and-run, Dorsey was arrested for public intoxication but released.  

The family of Miss Baker, a graduate of Mount Vernon–Enola High School, will hold her funeral next Friday, according to a Facebook memorial page.
