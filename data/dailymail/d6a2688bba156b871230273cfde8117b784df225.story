A bizarre garbage truck accident has left a man dead and a woman seriously injured after it emptied a dumpster and began its rounds - while the couple slept inside.

Franshon Barr, 46, and his unidentified sleeping partner had bedded down for the night inside the steel container, in Terre Haute, Indiana, wrapping themselves in its rubbish to keep warm.

But when morning came, a dustman arrived to begin his shift and poured the contents of the giant trash can into his truck without realising there were people inside.

Scroll down for video.

He made three stops, each time piling yet more detritus into the truck before he finally heard banging and screams echoing from within.

Police and emergency crews arrived and pulled the woman to safety but Mr Barr was not so lucky.

Terre Haute Police Chief John Plasse told the channel that while such deaths are rare, it is not uncommon for rough sleepers to seek shelter in dumpsters.

'In talking with the driver, he said that it’s not uncommon when they
go to pick up a dumpster … they’ve had those (dumpster) doors flip open
before and whoever’s inside come out,' Plasse said.
