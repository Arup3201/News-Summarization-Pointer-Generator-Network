Women who shave their bikini lines risk complications such as infections, burns, severe itching, rashes or cuts, a new study has warned. 

U.S. researchers found that 87 per cent of women currently remove all or some of their pubic hair, with the majority using a razor, while the rest admitted to getting a bikini wax at least once in their life.

Almost two thirds (60 per cent) of the women also reported experiencing at least one health-related complication, which also included invisible cuts to the skin called epidermal abrasions, ingrown hairs, bruises or allergies.

U.S. researchers found that almost two thirds of women surveyed experienced at least one health complication as a result of removing their public hair, such as infections, burns, severe itching, rashes or cuts

Overweight and obese women were found to be twice as likely to experience a complication than their slimmer counterparts and three times more likely if they removed all of their pubic hair rather than just some of it.

For the new research, women who received care from April to June 2012 at two publicly funded clinics in the Texas Gulf Coast region were asked questions about their pubic hair removal via a questionnaire. 

In total, the data of 333 women was used, and they were all aged 16- 40 years old and of differing ethnicities.

Researchers found only 4 per cent of all the women had ever seen a health care provider for a complication related to their pubic hair removal, and only 4 per cent had discussed how to safely remove their hair with a professional.

Previous studies have found that waxing a bikini line increases the risk of contracting an STD

Black and Hispanic women were less likely than white women to report complications, the study found.

Despite the complications, only 44 of the women surveyed said they used to remove their hair but had stopped.

The most common reason cited by 41 per cent of these women was disliking the side effects, which included stubble, bumps, rashes, or ingrown hairs.

Other reasons were too much of a hassle (25 per cent), lack of sexual activity (11.4 per cent), liking the look of pubic hair (7.1 per cent), and their partner wanted them to stop (2.4 per cent).

Becoming pregnant was the reason 14 women said they had stopped.

In the report, lead researcher Andrea DeMaria, lead researcher from the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Women's Health at the University of Texas Medical Branch concluded women should seek professional advice about safe hair removal.

She said: ‘Minor complications commonly occur as a result of pubic hair removal. 

'Gynecological visits could provide a safe environment for women to discuss pubic hair removal practices.’

The study was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.  

Previous research has found that bikini waxing could increase the risk of contracting an STI because removing the public hair can cause 'deficits in the mucocutaneous barrier' - the membrane of the skin - allowing viruses or bacteria to enter the body.

The study found self-waxing kits also led to burns that required split skin grafting.

However, a past Australian study found waxing has helped to eradicate pubic lice.

Doctors said that as pubic hair disappeared, so did the crab-shaped insects that had made homes in human groins since man first appeared. 

Andrea DeMaria, from the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Women's Health, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at the University of Texas Medical Branch gave the following advice on safe bikini-line shaving.
