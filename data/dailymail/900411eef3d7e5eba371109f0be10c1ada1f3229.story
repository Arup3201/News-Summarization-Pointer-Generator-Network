Established in honour of Sportsmail legend Ian Wooldridge, who died almost eight years ago, his annual award is voted for by you. 

It celebrates the sporting genius and Corinthian spirit so beloved of ‘Woolers’. This year you picked Manchester United’s Darren Fletcher — now we invite you to nominate a sportsperson for next year.

Here are some suggestions from our writers...

Ian Wooldridge began writing for the Daily Mail in 1960 and worked for them for nearly 50 years

PAUL NEWMAN - Moeen Ali

I would like to nominate a very modern and very proud Englishman in Moeen Ali because I think Ian would like the cut of his jib. 

Not only would Woolers, who loved his cricket, appreciate the almost Gower-esque, left-handed strokeplay and off-spin bowling, but he would like Moeen the man. 

Above all, I think Ian would value how Moeen is a fantastic role model for British Muslims at a time when there are such atrocities going on in Iraq and Syria in the name of Islam.

JEFF POWELL - Carl Froch

Carl Froch, for the courage to go again after a tough fight with George Groves, not hide behind the first win. 

That gave our public a spectacular event in front of a record-breaking crowd at Wembley Stadium and one of the most phenomenal knock-outs in the history of the prize-ring. 

All on the 40th anniversary year of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman rumbling in the jungle, which Woolers was so delighted to cover — and did so with customary panache.

LAURA WILLIAMSON - Lynsey Sharp

Lynsey Sharp defied serious illness and injury to win an emotional 800 metres Commonwealth silver medal on home turf in Glasgow — 28 years after her sprinter father, Cameron, collected the last of his five Commonwealth honours.

The Scot then added European silver in Zurich and also broke the two-minute barrier for the first time in 2014.

At a time when British female middle- distance running is thriving, Sharp has stood out — competing with style, heart and conviction. It’s amazing what you can achieve with a hole in your foot.

DEREK LAWRENSON - Paul McGinley

I remember Woolers once describing the Ryder Cup as the best sporting show on earth, and how he would have loved this year’s contest at Gleneagles and having conversations with Europe’s captain, Paul McGinley. 

It would have been a mutual love-in, for the Dubliner enjoys picking the brains of sports writers. 

I can picture the pair jabbering away on all sporting topics, with a European Tour press officer in the background looking at his watch, wondering how on earth he was going to get McGinley to his next assignment on time.

MIKE DICKSON - Caroline Wozniacki

Having been cursorily dumped by fiance Rory McIlroy in a phone call lasting a few minutes, Caroline Wozniacki could easily have collapsed in a heap. 

Her response was quite the opposite, renewing her commitment to tennis to the extent that she arrested her career slump and reached the final of the US Open. She also entered the New York Marathon when she was due to be married, raising money for charity. 

And all the time she managed to stay classy about her one-time partner, despite the enormous hurt. Ian would have been much impressed by the dignity and determination she showed, inside and out of the sporting arena.

RIATH AL-SAMARRAI - Roger Federer

During 2013 it was ludicrously suggested by some that Roger Federer was tarnishing his legacy by not retiring and avoiding what had become quite frequent defeats against lesser men.

Those views showed no regard or respect for Federer’s deep love of his sport. Of course he’s a determined competitor, but that’s only ever been part of the story.

Therefore, to see him retain that smile and joy this season while simultaneously going so close to regaining the world No 1 spot has been special. No-one should be wishing away his career because there might not be another one like him.

MARTHA KELNER - Jo Pavey

Sometimes major breakthroughs take a while and it makes them all the more spectacular when they do happen. Jo Pavey was 40 and had been running competitively for 24 years when she won her first major title — 10,000m gold at the European Championships this summer. 

Just weeks earlier this mother from Devon fought the might of the Kenyan distance runners to clinch 5,000m bronze at the Commonwealth Games, having given birth to her second child Emily just 10 months beforehand. Jo’s story is not only inspiring to people who love running but it gives encouragement to ordinary mothers that they can achieve amazing feats. 

Not that Jo would think of herself in those terms — she is so humble. Jo and husband Gavin, also her coach, are targeting a fifth Olympics in Rio, with no lottery funding. You wouldn’t bet against her.
