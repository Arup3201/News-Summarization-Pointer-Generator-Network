Steve Bruce has hailed the ‘exciting’ capture of £9.5million club-record signing Abel Hernandez.

The Uruguay striker - a deadline-day arrival from Serie A side Palermo, where he scored 33 times from 111 appearances – has penned a three-year deal at the KC Stadium with the option of a fourth.

And Tigers boss Bruce said: ‘Abel is a fantastic signing and highlights just how far the club has come in such a short space of time.

On the move: Hull have completed a deal for Palermo's Abel Hernandez for £9.5million

Through the door: George Boyd penned a deal with Premier League new boys Burnley earlier in the day

‘He is an exciting talent and like myself, I’m sure the supporters can’t wait to see him in action.’ 

Hernandez was part of Uruguay’s World Cup squad in Brazil and he has seven goals from 14 outings for his country. 

The 24-year-old has been on Humberside since last week but Hull had to wait for a work permit to be granted. He should make his debut when City entertain West Ham on September 15.
