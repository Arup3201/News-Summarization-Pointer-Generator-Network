One of David Cameron’s only ally in his battle over handing out Brussels top jobs has announced he wants to abandon liberal democracy.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was the only other EU leader to back Mr Cameron in trying to block Jean-Claude Junker from becoming European Commission President.

But he has stunned opposition groups in Hungary after declaring he wants to ‘build an illiberal new state’ like Russia, China and Turkey.

Mr Cameron went into battle with the rest of the EU last month over the decision to hand the top Brussels job to Mr Juncker.

He warned the move would mark a ‘sad moment’ which the EU would ‘live to regret’.

After insisting on pushing the decision to a vote in Brussels, Mr Cameron was left isolated – with the exception of Mr Orban.

But this could be an alliance Mr Cameron will seek to play down.

In a speech retreat of ethnic Hungarian leaders in Baile Tusnad, Romania, Mr Orban said claimed the 2008 global financial crash was proof ‘liberal democratic states can’t remain globally competitive’, Bloomberg reported.

He added: ‘I don’t think that our European Union membership precludes us from building an illiberal new state based on national foundations.

He pointed to Singapore, China and Russia as ‘successful’ role models, adding: ‘We want to build a workfare society ... which is willing to bear the odium to declare that it is not liberal in character.’

Since his election in 2010, Mr Orban has courted controversy by centralising executive power, weakening democratic checks and balances and increasing the role of the state.

He added: ‘The Hungarian nation is not a mere pile of individuals but a community which needs to be organized, strengthened and built.’

After losing the vote and warning the EU could come to regret it, Mr Cameron was pictured doing an awkward high-five with Mr Juncker

Mr Orban claimed that his attempts to reform Hungary were being held back by conflicts with the EU and by 'paid political activists' in civic groups financed from abroad.

Paul Ivan, an analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre, said: ‘Orban’s comments are very controversial and closer to what we’re used to hearing from President Putin of Russia than from a leader of a European democracy.

‘It’s also an extremely bad moment to cite Russia and Turkey as examples, with Russia becoming much more imperialistic and nationalistic and with serious attacks on the freedom of speech in Turkey.’

And Viktor Szigetvari, co-chairman of the E14-PM opposition alliance, warned of the 'constantly deteriorating quality of Hungarian democracy’.

'Serious and active means are needed to put an end to the demolition of Hungarian democracy,' Mr Szigetvari said.
