David Foley enjoyed a man-of-the-match debut for Ireland in Dublin on Sunday, but the Munster lock believes the challenges are just beginning with the World Cup next year.

After a scrappy first half which saw Ireland lead 9-0, Felix Jones claimed a brace and Dave Kilcoyne, Richardt Strauss, Simon Zebo and Stuart Olding crossed for tries, with Giorgi Nemsadze responding for Georgia.

Foley was one of 13 changes to the side that beat South Africa the previous weekend and took his chance in style.

‘It was incredible,’ he said. ‘I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a kid but I won’t be getting carried away. We’ve got a massive task next week against Australia.

‘But there’s great confidence in the squad. The provinces are going well and we are trying to build for the World Cup. We’ve got strength in depth and fellas are hungry to play.’

Ireland had been limited by a number of mistakes in the first half but were more clinical after the break.

The slow start did not surprise coach Joe Schmidt given the number of changes made, but he was pleased with the way the players responded.

‘It’s always a bit of a banana skin when it’s Georgia and you’ve made 13 changes,’ Schmidt said. ‘

We were a little bit static in the first half but we kept the structure and knew the ruck penalties they were accumulating were an opportunity for us.’
