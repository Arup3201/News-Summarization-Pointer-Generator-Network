Thierry Henry believes Manchester United will miss out on a spot in next season's Champions League because Louis van Gaal's side are 'some way off from gelling'. 

Manchester United face stiff competition from the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool to finish inside the top four - with just 10 Barclays Premier League games to go before the end of the season. 

The Red Devils go into their match against Tottenham with a two-point lead over fifth-placed Liverpool, however Henry insists United will miss out a top-four spot for the second year running.

Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup on Monday as Arsenal ran out 2-1 winners at Old Trafford 

United are currently fourth in the Premier League 

Speaking exclusively to The Sun, Henry said: 'People keep telling me that this Manchester United team is about to click, 

'After 28 Premier League games, I'm still waiting. And time is now running out for everything to fall into place for Louis van Gaal. 

'This United side looks as though it is still some way off from gelling as the players seem to struggle with the tactics and system of playing. 

'The problem is the Dutchman, although an excellent manager with a proven track record, does not seem to know his best team. 

'At the start of this season, I had no doubt that United would finish in the top four and return to the Champions League.

'It now looks as though the four will be Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool.' 

Manchester United will be hoping to bounce back from Monday's FA Cup defeat by Arsenal and open up a five-point lead over Liverpool.
