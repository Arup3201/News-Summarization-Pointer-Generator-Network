A breast cancer patient whose arrest prompted an outcry has been released from jail just a week before surgery which could save her life.

Ruth Alvarez walked free in tears yesterday from Lower Buckeye Jail in Pheonix, Arizona, to be greeted by family members including her 18-year-old daughter.

The Mexican national was first arrested in September over claims she used another person's identity to gain work. The case was dropped but prosecutors relaunched it and detained her on April 1.

By that time she had stage three breast cancer and was just three weeks from a planned mastectomy on April 23.

She wept as she told Fox News while trapped in jail: 'It's so hard going to treatments, seeing how your body, your whole life changes.

'I know I was wrong but at the time I only used it to get a job.

'If they want to come back and get me that's fine. I just want to be out there with my family on those days.'

Alvarez agreed a plea bargain with the Maricopa County Attorney on Wednesday which saw her admit a misdemeanor. She will serve a year of unsupervised probation.

The cancer has spread to nearby lymph 
nodes but has not invaded distant organs, meaning the surgery could give
 her a fighting chance.

Alvarez had already received 
chemotherapy before her arrest and the tumor had shrunk significantly, and they are 
hopeful about the mastectomy.

She will return home before entering hospital to prepare for the surgery next week.

Alvarez,
 who had been living in the country illegally, wept again as she hugged 
her 18-year-old daughter Indira Alvarado outside the jail surrounded by 
several supporters.

'I'm very happy and very thankful,' she said. I never expected this much support...I prayed for this moment.'

She
 praised county attorney Bill Montgomery, saying: 'I feel he's a very 
good person. He is like one of my angels to give me a chance to fight 
for my life.'

Waiting game: The cancer is at stage three meaning it has spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not invaded distant organs, meaning the surgery next week to remove breast tissue could give her a fighting chance

Alvarez's daughter, who has a four-year-old brother, said she could not cope with watching her mother trying to struggle through in hail.

She said: 'It was heartbreaking to see her battling a potentially terminal illness behind bars without proper care or proper hygiene'

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said they had agreed to not detain her or pursue criminal action for the moment.

If they do pursue a case in future, she could be eligible to remain under a law for those who have lived in the U.S. more than 10 years and whose removal would cause 'exceptional hardship' for their families.
