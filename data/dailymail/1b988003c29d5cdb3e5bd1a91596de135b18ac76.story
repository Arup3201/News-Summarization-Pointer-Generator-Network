After posting his first tweet, it was followed by 'Oh! Now I get it. Big Bird here, live on Twitter!'.

Once he got the hang of things, he also reached out to his friend Cookie Monster, who joined Twitter in September 2014, and was enjoying art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, according to CNN.

He wrote: 'Hi @MeCookieMonster! Have fun at @MuseumModernArt! Can you send me some pictures of bird art, please!'

But Big Bird and Cookie Monster are not the only members of Sesame Street sharing their thoughts on Twitter.

Elmo also has been an active member on Twitter since November 2012 but shared a first tweet last September.

The cast of the longtime television favorite children's show celebrated it's 45th year on air last November. It also celebrated the man behind the show, Caroll Spinney (right), 81, who has played both Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch for the past 45 years since the show's first episode on November 10, 1969

For Sesame Street television specials, Spinney has traveled to Japan, Australia, China, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (above Big Bird with 

Spinney said he had no idea the show would become as big as it is back in 1969 when it 'seemed very slow and dull.' But Sesame Street is the longest-running children's show in television history (above the cast in 2004)
