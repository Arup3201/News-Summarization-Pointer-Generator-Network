From skyscrapers and bridges to markets and houses, modern buildings can transform the skyline and mood of a city.

And in order to create new landmarks and public forums, structural engineers have to marry cutting-edge architectural design and making a building stand up.

Now, some of the best new structures around the world – from a new Apple store in Istanbul to a bridge modelled on a Maori fishhook – have been shortlisted for The Structural Awards 2014.

Some of the best new structures around the world - from a new Apple store in Istanbul to a bridge modelled on a Maori fishhook - have been shortlisted for The Structural Awards 2014. This is the new Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London

The prestigious competition, run by The Institution of Structural Engineers in London, celebrates innovative designs and materials in all types of buildings and structures.

Shortlisted structures include everything from wood-clad eco houses to metallic futuristic market places, shops that look like glass cuboids, bridges with opening parts and a bulbous stock exchange that appears to defy gravity.

Certain projects, such as a footbridge in the Rocky Mountains, Canada, had not only to fit into a beautiful location, but to add to the landscape.

This is the new lightweight-concrete staircase with a steel core at the Grade I listed Somerset House in London, designed to last for 120 years

Certain projects, such as this footbridge in the Rocky Mountains, Canada, had not only to fit into a beautiful location, but add to the landscape. Structural engineers created a 'minimal' footbridge clad with wood that is designed to absorb the vibrations of walkers and joggers trampling across it.The judges of the competition noted that not only is it practical, bit it 'respects the beautiful natural setting'

The judges of the competition noted that not only is it practical, but it ‘respects the beautiful natural setting’.

Some projects shoehorned incredibly modern features such as dramatic metal staircases, into classical older buildings.

There are only five elements to this new Apple 'lantern' building - four sheets of glass and a single panel of metal. The only thing holding them together is silicone.'Only engineering excellence and attention to detail can produce a result of such simplicity and purity of expression,' the judges said

The Lower Hatea Crossing (pictured) is part of a plan to reduce traffic congestion around the city of Whangarei, New Zealand. The architectural appearance was inspired by a traditional Maori fish hook.The judges said: 'The client aspired for the bridge to be a public landmark that would reflect the art and culture of the Maori people. The innovative design of the bridge has delivered that aspiration.'

And other shortlisted entries pushed the boundaries when it came to the use of materials. Engineers from Arup designed the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in Shenzhen, China.

It has a 836ft (255metre) high tower that supports a three storey ‘podium’ 118ft (36 metres) above ground level. The effect is dramatic and also includes a glass façade that changes appearance in different lighting conditions.

Entries came from New Zealand, Turkey, China, Germany, Canada, as well as many from the UK and the winners will be announced in London on November 14, 2014.

Red Bridge House is set within a remote area of ancient woodland in East Sussex. The vision was to create a bespoke three-storey residential structure, worthy of its unique setting. The judges said: 'Elegant design and detailing combine to give this daringly-conceived project a light, open feeling. The outcome is a delightful residence'

Slipstream (pictured) is a giant sculpture in the new Heathrow Terminal 2 building, expressing the movement of a stunt plane flying through the entrance space. It is the longest permanent sculpture in Europe, made from around 32,000 unique parts. The judges said: 'It is a great example of creative art and engineering coming together.'

‘We hold the Structural Awards each year to recognise outstanding work by structural engineers and to raise awareness about the vital global role they play creating innovative design solutions,’ said Martin Powell, Chief Executive of The Institution of Structural Engineers.

‘From skyscraper and bridge construction to heritage and home projects, the awards showcase the full range of chartered structural engineers’ abilities - as trusted professionals, problem solvers, and the guardians of public safety.’

The new bridge at Schönebeck, Germany, (pictured) is the largest cable-stayed bridge in the region, constructed to relieve the City of Schönebeck from a considerable increase of through traffic.  The judges were impressed by the elegant simplicity of the bridge, which has been thoughtfully detailed to fit perfectly into the surrounding landscape

The Kew House project  (pictured) brings a refreshingly different and highly-engineered approach to the archetypal problem of creating attractive, useable space on a tightly-constrained site, the judges said
