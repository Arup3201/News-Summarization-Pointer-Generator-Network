A 51-year-old lawyer has moved back in with his mother - after giving up his Los Angeles home to a family of strangers for a year.

Tony Tolbert looked for a family in need after his father, an entertainment lawyer, set a glowing example when he was growing up by always welcoming people to stay in their spare room.

'You don't have to be Bill Gates or 
Warren Buffet or Oprah,' Tolbert told CBS. 'We can do it wherever we are, 
with whatever we have, and for me, I have a home that I can make 
available.'

His mother, Marie Tolbert, added: 'He is so giving, and he's always been that way.'

Tolbert went to Alexandria House, a shelter for homeless women and children, and came across Felicia Dukes, who lived in a single bedroom with three of her children.

Her family had been separated as the shelter was just for children and her eldest son was unable to join them. Tolbert told staff he wanted to bring the family back together, and offered his home.

'They had a young man that wanted to 
donate their house to you for a year,' Dukes recounted staff telling her. 'And I'm looking
at her, like, what? Like - Are you serious?'

The family has now moved into the three-bedroom, two-bathroom home - with Duke's oldest son in tow. It is worth nearly $400,000, according to online estimates.

'My heart just fills up and stuff,' Dukes said, as she wiped away the tears. 'I'm just really happy.'

Tolbert said he is just happy to help with the lessons he learned from his father, Jimmy Tolbert, who is now suffering from Alzheimer's Disease.

'Kindness creates kindness,' he told CBS. 'Generosity creates generosity. Love creates love.

'I think if we can share some of that and have more stories about people
doing nice things for other people, and fewer stories about people 
doing horrible things to other people, that's a better world.'

Reunion: She moved into the home with her kids including her oldest son, who was not allowed in the shelter

The heartwarming story comes after reports that 10-year-old Gracie McNulty, from England, served Christmas dinners to 50 homeless people, achieving her father's last Christmas wish.

Her father Craig, 38, was a regular charity volunteer who had served breakfast to the homeless on Boxing Day in the past, and he had promised to open the  family’s cafe on Christmas Day this year.

But Mr McNulty, a roofer, suffered 
serious head injuries when he fell while working. He was taken to 
hospital by air ambulance but died soon after the accident in August.

'It's
been the best Christmas ever,' Gracie said. 'I was just at school 
feeling sad about my dad so decided I wanted to do something to make him
proud and this felt like the perfect thing.'
