Tyson Fury claims he would have an easy night's work against Wladimir Klitschko as he and Christian Hammer had to be pulled apart during a heated weigh-in. 

Fury is the mandatory challenger world heavyweight champion Klitschko but must avoid a slip-up against Hammer at the O2 in London on Saturday night. 

And the 26-year-old would rather face the Ukrainian than recently-crowned champion Deontay Wilder.

'To be honest I'm the man in the division to beat,' Fury said. 'Everyone wants to fight me because they know I generate interest. People are interested in me probably for the wrong reasons, or the right reasons, but they're still interested - that's why people want to fight.

'They want to come to the UK to fight me. [Deontay Wilder's] the world champion but he's the guy who first said he wants to fight Tyson Fury after winning the title. So I must be doing something right, I must be on the right track.

'I would like to fight Wladimir [Klitschko] first because No 1 he's my mandatory, No 2 he's the best in the division and No 3 because he is an easy fight. Then I'll fight Wilder. I won't be taking any interim fights I'll unify straight away.'

The Fury camp has been given a boost with the recent release from prison of Tyson's dad John Fury after five-years away.

The imposing heavyweight believes that the return of his father will be a major plus for him going forward.

'It's definitely [a boost] to have my dad back, he's been away for a long time, so having him back in the gym and seeing his face every day is very good – it's happy days at Team Fury,' he said.

'He gets to the gym at seven in the morning and doesn't leave till 10 at night; he's definitely putting his misspent time back into practice in the gym. It is nice having him around and seeing his face back in the gym and the smile on it when you're doing good things in boxing.

'Anybody would be proud of what their sons achievements are - whatever they do. You don't have to be so successful but as long as you've got somebody who tries their best in something that they're doing then I think that any father should be proud of their son.

'You don't have to be a world champion, you don't have to be a millionaire but I believe every father should be proud of his own son,'

Chris Eubank Jnr also weighed in ahead of his fight with Dimtry Chudinov on Saturday

Despite talk of a world title fight in the summer, former British and Commonwealth champion Fury is well aware that he cannot overlook 27-year-old Hammer, who has 17 wins from his 20 fights.

'At this level in boxing you're fighting top five opponents and in Hammer the No 3 ranked WBO heavyweight in the world so nobody is going to be easy, they're all hard fights,' he added.

'You can say I'm in touching distance of a world title but in hindsight I may as well be five million miles away because I'm not fighting Klitschko, I'm not in the ring with him and that fight's not happening in my mind.

'Until I'm in the ring in the opposite corner it's not on so it's just another fight for me, another day in the office. I'm going to go in there and box, move around and win and get out of there.'
