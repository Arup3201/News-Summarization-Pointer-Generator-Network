The 73-year-old ex-husband of a young trophy wife has been charged with stalking her months after she allegedly stabbed him in their kitchen with a knife.

Brygida Schefler, 28, told police her ex-husband, Maciej Nowicki, hid tracking devices in her SUV and frequently spied on her outside her home in Volusia County, Florida following their violent fight in July.

After Maciej accused Schefler of cheating on him that month, prompting Schefler to allegedly plunge a kitchen knife into his left arm, she filed an injunction for protection against him.

Still got the spark: Brygida Schefler, 28, has accused her ex-husband Maciej Nowicki, 73, of stalking her months after filing an injunction against him following a fight that left him with a 6-inch knife in his arm

On Thursday Schefler accused him of violating that injection for domestic violence as well as bragging about the tracking devices installed, according to a police affidavit obtained by the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

While visiting a friend on Thursday Schefler told police she saw Nowicki parked across the street watching her, leading to his arrest.

Schefller told police she doesn't want her ex-husband arrested, just for him to leave her alone.

Nowicki, who denied intentionally following Schefler to deputies, is being held without set bail in Volusia County.

An obviously passionate couple in their own ways, after Nowicki accused his then-wife in July of having an affair over the last year Scheffler allegedly attacked him with a 6-inch knife, plunging it into the septuagenarian’s left forearm.

Scheffler was arrested and charged with aggravated battery on a person older than 65.

Nowicki had raised his arm to protect himself when he suffered the blow, the police report states.

Investigators said the 72-year-old had grabbed a gold club to defend himself, reported The Daytona Beach News Journal.

Scheffler,
a waitress who is originally from Poland, then threatened Nowicki that 
if he called police it would be the last thing he’d do as her friends 
would come ‘do him in’, officials said.

Nowicki ignored the threats and called 911.

Responding deputies found Nowicki with large amounts of blood pouring from his arm.

There was blood and a small amount of flesh on the knife, said investigators.

Scheffler told the News Journal that  all the charges against her were false.

'Everything that the man said and all the charges they put on me are false,' she said.
