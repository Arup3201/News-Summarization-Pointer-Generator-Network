Less than a week after a  video seemingly showing men trying to take advantage of a drunken woman on Hollywood Boulevard was revealed to be a hoax, the actress who took part in the marketing ploy issued an apology.

Jennifer Box, a 24-year-old Los Angeles-based actress and model, took to YouTube Tuesday saying that she had been led to believe that she will be taking part in a 'light-hearted prank' when she was hired to portray a drunk girl.

'Had I known the damaging outcome of this video, I never would have participated,’ Box said.

Contrite: Actress Jennifer Box, 24, uploaded a video online apologizing for her participation in the now-infamous 'Drunk Girl in Public' video, which went viral last week before being revealed as a hoax 

In the video, the actress (pictured) pretends to be drunk and approaches five different men on Hollywood Boulevard in order to ask for directions to her bus stop in what was marketed as a type of social experiment

Miss Box, who goes by the nickname ‘Jennifo,’ concluded her videotaped mea culpa by pointing out that all the men who pretended to prey on her were 'perfect gentlemen.'

‘So, from the bottom of my heart, I am very, very sorry for my participation in this production and any harm it may have caused,’ the striking brunette said into the camera.

The 'Drunk Girl in Public' video was posted on YouTube November 11 and quickly became a hit with people across the internet expressing outrage at the several sober men who came up to the actress - who was pretending to be intoxicated while staggering down Hollywood Boulevard - and tried to coax her back to their homes. 

Just two days later, one of the men who appeared in the video came forward to reveal that the whole thing was staged by a viral marketing company and they were just following prompts from directors Stephen Zhang, 20, and Seth Leach.

And when one of those men posted on Facebook to express his anger that he had been portrayed as a predator, one of the filmmakers tried to silence him with free drinks and the promise of future work.

The real 'Drunk Girl': The woman in the video is a 24-year-old LA-based actress and model, who goes by the nickname 'Jennifo' 

Setting the record straight: Box said that she was hired to take part in what she had been told was a 'light-hearted' prank

Truth comes out: The striking brunette said that all the men featured in the video were 'perfect gentlemen' 

The video follows 24-year-old model Jennifer Box as she pretends to be seriously intoxicated, walking down Hollywood Boulevard and asking men for directions to the bus stop that will get her to Culver City.

Shockingly, of the five men featured, only one actually offers her assistance, while the rest attempt to lure her back to their homes - despite her obviously drunken state. 

Two sources told The Smoking Gun that men in the video were approached on the street and asked to participate in a 'comedic, hidden camera' video.

One man who decided not to appear in the video, says he was told it was a 'student video' and that it appeared they had no releases or paperwork to sign.

Mike  Koshak is one of the men who agreed to participate in the video and is filmed in a blue tank top, telling the tipsy woman: 'You're in no shape to be walking around like this' before leading her in the direction of his home where there is 'more beer'.

Mike Koshak, pictured right, said he was asked to participate in what he thought was a student video, in which he followed the direction of its creators

In the video, he is interrupted talking to the woman by another man who also then tries to take advantage of her

But both Mr Koshak and his boss deny the film's authenticity, saying he was just trying to help the student filmmakers out.

Christine Peters is the owner of LA Epic, a company which arranges nightclub crawls, and she said Mr Koshak worked selling tickets to tourists.

He was wearing a tank-top advertising the business when he was approached by the video's creators on the street to 'say a couple of lines for a comedy sketch.'

'They made it seem like he was trying to take the girl home,' she said, adding that her business does not  'condone such behavior.'

Mr Koshak has also spoken out about the video on Facebook, writing that it 'was all staged and all of the people in it were acting'.

The first man  (pictured) tries to lure Jennifer back to his apartment with the promise of a water bed. But the authenticity of the film has now been called into question after those who appeared in it say they were told they were acting in a student video

The video 'does not portray myself or any of the other people in it correctly,' he said, adding that it's a 'false a** portrayal and I was lied to about what the video even was. Faulty a*** shit.'

After publishing the post, he says he received a private Facebook message from Mr Leach who tried to convince him to keep quiet.

'The important thing to consider is that this video is going to get you well known and have a future with us and our company,' he allegedly wrote.

'We are going to be huge and you are part of it,' Mr Leach also said, before inviting him out for a night of free drinks. 'Just go with it dude, you are in our team now and we will take care of you.'

Mr Leach himself appears unconcerned about the latest claims. Last Tuesday, he boasted on Facebook about the video's success and to say he was leaving LA for a few days and will be 'creating some more viral videos for your viewing and learning pleasure'.

'I just want to help you': The video showed another man trying to get the young woman into his car
