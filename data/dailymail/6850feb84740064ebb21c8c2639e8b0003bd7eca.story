Waitorse has apologised to a customer after a member of staff refused to fillet a trout because it was deemed 'too slippery'.

The bizarre decision was branded the latest example of health and safety rules being misused.

The unnamed female customer was visiting her local branch of the upmarket chain to buy a filleted trout.

Apology: A member of staff working behind the fish counter at Waitrose refused to fillet a trout because it was 'too slippery'

None were available pre-packed so she asked the assistant behind the fresh fish counter if he could fillet some from a whole fish.

He agreed, but his supervisor stepped in and refused on the grounds of health and safety because the fish are 'too slippery'.

On its website Waitrose says 'just ask if you'd like your fish skinned or filleted'.

In another case, London publishing company owner Stuart Rock said that a butcher had refused to bone a leg of lamb for him.

He said the assistant had said he was 'competent to do the job', but was not permitted on health and safety ground.

The woman who was unable to have a trout filleted complained to the Health and Safety Executive and yesterday the watchdog's Myth Buster Panel ruled that she was in the right.

In a statement the panel said: 'Whilst fish filleting requires the 
person to know how to use knives safely, it is reasonable to expect this
service to be available at a fishmonger's counter in a supermarket 
especially when the website advertises the service.

'Slippery fish are a 
fact of life!' it added.

Slippery customer: The Health and Safety Executive ruled Waitrose was in the wrong for refusing to fillet a trout

Judith Hackitt, Chair of the Health and 
Safety Executive said: 'I'm glad the customer didn't fall for this red 
herring. This is just another case of poor customer service and nothing to do 
with health and safety.'

Waitrose apologised for the inconvenience to its customers.

A spokesman said: 'I'm afraid we don't 
know which branch this refers to so we are unable to comment in detail. 
However, we do offer a full filleting service and we're very sorry that 
we got it wrong on this occasion.'
