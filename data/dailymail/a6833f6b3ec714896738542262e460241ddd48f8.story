The Harvard Business School instructor who blasted a Boston-area Chinese restaurant for overcharging him by $4 on a takeout order has apologized.

Associate professor Benjamin Edelman complained to the owners the of Sichuan Garden in Brookline after he was charged $1 more on each of the four items he ordered for takeout recently.

Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owner, acknowledged the prices listed on its website were out of date and promised to update them soon.

Angry emailer: Ben Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard, has unleashed a string of angry and threatening emails to Sichuan Garden, claiming they overcharged him $4 and it was illegal

But Edelman demanded a $12 refund, citing state law. He also contacted local officials to demand the restaurant compensate all other customers who might have been affected.

On Tuesday, Edelman posted a message on his personal website admitting that his lengthy emails with Duan were 'out of line' and that he has reached out to the restaurant to apologize.

'Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it’s clear that I was very much out of line,' wrote Edelman on his website.

'I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future.'

EdeIman said he had also reached out to the owner to apologize to him personally as well.

Duan said he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from people as far afield as Australia offering donations and support with his website and legal advice.

Apologetic: Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owners who manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, responded to Edelman in a courteous way

'I just want to make clear that we are not a business in financial distress. We have been blessed with the support of our amazing community and hospitality family that has understood the value of a hard working family. Your support and kind words are more then enough,' he wrote.

Duan said he had also increased an increase in business as a result of the publicity that the story had generated and that he had received 'overwhelming' support from Harvard graduates and the student body. 

'I believe that one man’s actions should not be the burden of another. I just want to apologize to Harvard for all the negative association they have been linked with this ordeal. I also believe that something good can come out of all this situation,' he wrote.

Duan manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, a Chinese restaurant founded by his parents and appeared in a recent issue of GQ hailed as 'America's Most Imaginative Bartender'.

The incident began on Friday when Edelman ordered $53.53 worth of takeout from the restaurant and was shocked when the bill was $4 more than he had added up using the online menu.

He emailed the restaurant, who admitted that their website was 'out of date' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $1, causing the Harvard Business School professor to send a barrage of threatening emails that were made public by Boston.com.

'Under Massachusetts law it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price,' Edelman wrote.

'I urge you to cease this practice immediately.

'In the interim, I suggest that Sichuan Garden refund me three times the amount of the overcharge.

'The tripling reflects the approach provided under the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL 93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations.

'Please refund the $12 to my credit card. Or you could mail a check for $12 to my home.'

Edelman recieved an apologetic reply about an hour later from Duan.

'We are a mom and pop restaurant and we pride ourselves on hard work and authentic Sichuan cuisine,' Duan wrote.

'I will honor the website price and honor you the $3.00.'

However this only seemed to infuriate Edelman further.

Not happy: After initally going to great lengths to get the restaurant to credit him $12 over the so-called mishap, Edelman has now apologized profusely for his bullying behavior 

'It strikes me that merely providing a refund to a single customer would be an extremely light sanction for the violation that has occurred,' Edelman wrote back.

'To wit, your restaurant overcharged all customers who viewed the website and placed a telephone order – the standard and typical way to order takeout. 

'You did so knowingly, knowing that your website was out of date.

'You don't seem to recognize that this is a legal matter and calls for a more thoughtful and far-reaching resolution. 

'Nor do you recognize the principle, well established in applicable laws, that when a business intentionally overcharges a customer, the business should suffer a penalty larger than the amount of the overcharge.'

Duan responded with an obvious question: 'You seem like a smart man. But is this really worth your time?'

Again, Edelman came back firing. 

'You're right that I have better things to do,' Edelman's replied.

'If you had responded appropriately to my initial message – providing the refund I requested with a genuine and forthright apology – that could have been the end of it.

'The more you try to claim your restaurant was not at fault, the more determined I am to seek a greater sanction against you.'

Edelman 'passed the matter on to the authorities' in Brookline.

Duan wrote back: 'Once again thank you for bringing it to my attention, I will wait for proper authorities to direct me on how to resolve this situation.

'Once they direct me on how to resolve this situation with you, we will be able to honor the price that they advise me on.

'I will make a note that you seek out 50 percent off your total meal bill.

'I have no issues with honoring 50 percent off your total bill if the authorities see fit.

'I hope you understand I want to go through the proper channels so we can resolve this properly.

'I will keep you updated as soon as they contact me.'

According to Boston.com, besides Harvard, Edelman also operates a consulting practice that works at 'preventing and detecting online fraud (especially advertising fraud)'.

His clients include Microsoft, the NFL, the New York Times, and Universal Music.

Edelman sent a statement to Business Insider saying he believes how he handled the situation with Sichuan Garden was helping other people as well.

'We all rely on trust in our daily lives, that when sales tax is added, it actually applies and equals the specified amount; that the meter in a taxi shows the correct amount provided by law and correctly measures the actual distance; that when you order takeout, the price you see online matches the amount you pay in the restaurant,' he told the website.

'We all take most of this for granted.'
