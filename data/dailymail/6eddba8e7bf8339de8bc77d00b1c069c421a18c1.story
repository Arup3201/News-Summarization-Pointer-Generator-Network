A retired pensioner has been hit with a tax bill for £4.7billion after Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs sent him a letter demanding £950million a month.

Doug Yeomans, 78, from Shardlow in Derbyshire, is fighting tax officials to have the error corrected after he was told he owed £4,742,354,255 in unpaid income tax.

The former Grenadier Guardsman, who worked until he was 73, opened the letter on Saturday and was shocked to find the tax office would take the huge sum through a direct debit over five months.

Shocked: Doug Yeomans, 78, received a bill from HMRC saying he owed £4,742,354,255 in unpaid income tax

He immediately called staff at HMRC, who told him it 'might have been error'. 

Mr Yeomans, who spent most of his life working as a builder, said: 'I opened the letter and saw the amount and thought to myself, "I'd better start cutting down on the food bill then".

'They must think I'm a footballer or something, but I don't even think that Russian bloke who owns Chelsea could afford that amount.' 

He added: 'I think I can probably just about afford the £255, but I think the rest might be pushing it a bit.

'I live off a state pension, topped up with what I put aside as a pension after a lifetime of working in the building trade.

'When I phoned the customs people up to tell them about the tax demand the girl on the other end of the phone said to me "yes, I think in this case there might have been an error". I think she might just be right.

Extortionate: The letter said that the money would be a direct debit of £950million a month for five months

'She said I needed to speak to a different department and gave me a number which I rang and rang. 

'But it seems it is easier to get an audience with the Pope than speak to the right person at Revenue and Customs.

'It's laughable really, comical in fact, but I have recovered a lot of bills and demands from them over the past few months so it does worry me sometimes.'

He said he will continue to try and speak to the right person and get the mistake corrected.  

A spokesman for HMRC apologised and said the government department aimed to correct errors as quickly as possible.

Mr Yeomans, who retired aged 73, spent most of his life working in the building trade and helped build the M1

He said: 'We are very sorry to hear of the problems our customer has had and are very sorry about our error.

'We don't talk about individual cases but when we make mistakes we aim to put them right fast and apologise.'

During his working life, the father-of-two, whose wife, Mary, died in 2001, helped build the M1 motorway, East Midlands Airport and Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station.

He worked initially as a bricklayer and then a civil engineer and was still doing odd jobs as a maintenance man to the age of 73 when he finally retired.

His national service in the 1950s saw him serve in the British Army with the Grenadier Guards, stationed at Windsor Castle and in Cyprus.
