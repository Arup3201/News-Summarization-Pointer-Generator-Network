Nick Gordon sent a string of threatening tweets to Bobbi Kristina Brown's family as he fought with them over Whitney Houston's wealth, they claimed to police.

Bobbi Kristina's purported husband was turning her against the family of her mother as he allegedly tried to get his hands on her money, documents obtained by DailyMail.com reveal. 

At the start of last year, he posted a series of 'terrorist threats', which Marion 'Pat' Houston, who is married to Whitney's brother Gary, believed were directed at her, she told police.

Messages that could be the ones referenced in the police report are still visible on his Twitter feed, including: 'I got guns bigger then you. Watch them react to this.'

Family spat: Nick Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown were not happy with Whitney Houston's sister-in-law controlling the late singer's estate and were fighting for more money, according to police documents

Family fallout: Houston's sister-in-law Pat Houston (pictured in 2012) is the executor of Bobbi Kristina's trust fund - but told police she was threatened repeatedly after she refused to increase her allowance

The police report, compiled by Detective Braithwaite, details how Mrs Houston went to her local police department headquarters in Alpharetta, on 21 March, accompanied by her attorney Mark Trigg to complain about the messages.

The police report describes a number of 'social network listings of guns and foul language' alleged posted on Twitter by Mr Gordon, which Mrs Houston claimed were direct threats to her.

Some messages from the start of the year on his Twitter feed apparently name Pat Houston.

'Everybody got so f****** fake after Mom passed away. Specially Pat,' another read. 'F*** that pat b****' 

Others, which he wrote after she went to the police station, include: 'Now crawl your head in that noose' and 'It makes you sick when we are happy and I love it'.

Mrs Houston, who is the executor of the trust fund Whitney Houston set up to care for her daughter, claimed she was threatened repeatedly after she refused to increase Bobbi's monthly allowance.

The police statement read: 'Mr Gordon and Ms Brown are not pleased with Marion controlling Whitney Houston's estate.

Fears: Pat Houston went to police just days after Gordon wrote this message on his Twitter page

'Threats': Gordon wrote these messages around the time Pat Houston secured a protective order against him

Not letting it go: The following month he wrote another message apparently hinting at family trouble

'Marion informed me that Mr Gordon wants Ms Brown's monthly allowance increased. Marion refused to relinquish the money.

'Marion stated that Mr Gordon has turned Krissy against the family and in the process has said threatening statements to Marion and other family members.'

The police statement continued that Bobbi Kristina would be given full access to her mother's $12 million fortune only when she is 35. 

But the detective dismissed the allegations of 'terrorist threats' and told Bobbi Kristina's aunt that he 'did not see anything on the lines of terrorist threats'. 

After reviewing Gordon's Twitter posts Detective Braithwaite refused to mount a criminal investigation into Mrs Houston's allegations.

His report concludes: 'It was discovered that Mr Gordon has not made any threats of violence towards Marion. Alpharetta Police Detectives will not further investigate this matter.'

Still, Pat Houston obtained a court order banning Gordon, 25, from 'approaching within 200 yards' of her, her family, her home or work, calling or sending her letters and 'any other form of contact' from a Fulton County Superior Court judge on April 14th last year.

Battle: Bobbi Kristina's husband has turned her against members of her late mother's family, police said. The singer is pictured with her daughter, who is currently battling for her life in hospital, in February 2011

The 'Default Stalking Twelve-Month Protective Order' - banning Gordon from close contact with Whitney Houston's most trusted family members - is still in effect. It expires on April 13th 2015.

This means Nick Gordon cannot be at Bobbi Kristina's bedside at the same time as many of her closest relatives as they visit her at Emory University Hospital.

Bobbi Kristina Brown and Nick Gordon claimed they tied the knot in January last year - although her father has since come out to say the couple were never married.  

'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' said Bobby Brown's lawyer, Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC, in a statement on Tuesday. 

Their reported union had raised eyebrows as they were brought up together as brother and sister in the same house after Whitney Houston took the troubled boy under her wing when he was 12. 

However, the pair dismissed this criticism insisting they are not blood related and that Gordon was never adopted by Whitney Houston, although he described her as his mother. 

Gordon has previously been accused of becoming romantically involved with Bobbi Kristina to get closer to Whitney Houston's wealth.

But DailyMail.com has learned that it was Bobbi Kristina who pushed the relationship forward.

Whitney Houston's troubled daughter has even been accused of 'buying' Nick Gordon's affections, by a close relative.

Married? The couple claim they married last year - but Bobbi Kristina's father claims they never wed

'I told Krissy, "you can't buy his love",' Ella Mae Watson, Marion 'Pat' Houston's mother, told DailyMail.com

The 82-year-old explained the troubled young woman had cried on her shoulder about her unrequited love to foster brother Nick Gordon following her mother's death in Los Angeles in 2012.

Mrs Watson told DailyMail.com: 'The baby girl was crying on my shoulder about the boy. She said he told her that he loved her as a sister and that was all.

'I told her it didn't matter how many things she gave him she could not buy his love. That was after her mother died.'

Mrs Watson was staying with her daughter Pat Houston in Georgia when Bobbi 'Krissy' Brown was discovered unconscious in the bath at her home in Roswell, Georgia, on Saturday morning.

She added: 'My daughter (Marion 'Pat' Houston) is up at the hospital. She is with Kristy as is her husband Gary. Everyone is very worried.'

Mrs Watson also cast doubt on whether the young couple had formalized their relationship.

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina have refused to give details of when and where they married.

Vigil: Gordon is pictured outside the Atlanta area hospital where Bobbi Kristina was being treated on Sunday. The 21-year-old was rushed to hospital after Gordon and a friend found her face-down in a bathtub

She said: 'I heard that they got married and then I heard that they had not after all.'

The revelations come as it has emerged that police are looking into the possibility that eye-witnesses may have fled the scene after Bobbi Kristina was found face-down in a bathtub on Saturday.

Roswell Police Detectives are investigating whether people fled before officers arrived and have been asking local businesses if they saw anything suspicious that morning, E! News reported.  

Nearby bank employees told detectives they saw nothing but police have requested surveillance footage, sources told the website.

Bobbi Kristina is now being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after being moved from North Fulton Hospital earlier this week. She remains in a coma.
