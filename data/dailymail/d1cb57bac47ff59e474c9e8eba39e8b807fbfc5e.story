Residents and passers-by on a Manhattan street were terrified on Thursday afternoon when a manhole exploded sending flames shooting several feet into the air.

The incident, which the New York Fire Department believe was a transformer fire, occurred on 25th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenue, near Madison Square Park.

There were no evacuations and no one was injured, but the street was temporarily shut down while firefighters were called to deal with the blaze.

The fire is believed to have been caused by electrical wires under the manhole and ConEd are investigating.
