A 50-year-old father who let his son's friends party at their Connecticut property has been charged with reckless endangerment after a teenager died in a car crash as she made her way home.

Paige Houston, 17, died after the pick up truck she was a passenger in crashed as a group of teenagers left a party on August 6.

Paul Sibiga appeared in court today after police claimed he had let minors gather in woodland at his home and drink alcohol.

Teenagers regularly gathered in the family's woodland, where they would have a campfire and drink, it has been claimed.

According to an arrest warrant, seen by the Hartford Courant, those who attended the parties had to leave their car keys at Mr Sibiga's house and stay over if they planned to drink.

'Anyone who was 
drinking at the property was not allowed to drive home and either camped
out at the White House or in the basement of the Sibiga house,' the warrant said.

However, on August 6 a 17-year-old, who was over the drink-drive limit, lost control of his pick up truck and hit a tree.

Paige, a cheerleader and honors student, was thrown from the backseat and died of her injuries.

Two other teenagers in the car fled the scene and were later found by police in the Sibiga woodland.

When police questioned the driver, who has not been named, he told them he had been at a party at the Sibiga property, and had consumed one and a half beers.

A blood test revealed his blood alcohol content was .11 per cent. The legal limit for under 21s is .02 per cent.

He was charged on Thursday with first-degree manslaughter, drink driving, three counts of reckless endangerment and making a false statement to police.

When police went to Mr Sibiga's property they found at least 10 cars in the drive, but when they knocked on the door he said no one else was in the house.

He admitted his son had been having a party and later led police to the 34-acre woodland, across the road from the house.

Police identified and interviewed 28 teenagers who were at the party.

One of the teenagers claimed to have been told by Mr Sibiga's son that 'keys had to be left at the house and 'It is a rule at these parties that if you are 
drinking, you have to stay over'.

None of the teenagers said they had seen Mr Sibiga at the woodland party area until he arrived with police in the early hours of August 6, after the crash.

Mr Sibiga was charged on Thursday with 28 counts of reckless endangerment and 28 counts of permitting minors to possess alcohol.

His attorney, Paul Melocowski, 
told FoxCT: 'Something happens in your own property, that’s one thing, 
but if something’s alleged to have happened deep in the woods somewhere,
it goes to what you were able to see, not see, what you have knowledge 
of.'

Under the conditions of his release, Mr Sibiga is not allowed to let youngsters on to his property unless they are members of his family.
