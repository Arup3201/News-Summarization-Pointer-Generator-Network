A man is on the run after allegedly beating his girlfriend’s four-year-old godson to death just a mile from the scene of the notorious Amityville Horror killings of 1974.

Adonis Reed was found unconscious in his pyjamas at 4pm on Wednesday by detectives on Long Island, New York.

He was pronounced dead in hospital two hours later.

Adonis lived with his six-year-old sister and his godmother Lakisha Pitt whose boyfriend, Jonathan Thompson, is a suspect.

According to her father Willie Pitt, 
Ms Pitt received a phone call from Thompson who had taken the day off 
work to care for a sick Adonis in the Amityville apartment the couple 
rented.

Lakisha Pitt ordered Thompson to call the police and left her workplace to check on her godson, the New York Post reports.

When police arrived at the scene they discovered Adonis lying unconscious on a 
couch in the living room and Thompson had vanished.

Mr Pitt told the New York Post that Adonis was a 'smiling, happy child' who dreamed of becoming a police office.

'He was just a happy little kid,' he said. 'The boyfriend seemed to take good care of him. This makes no sense.'

The child had visible signs of trauma. The Medical Examiner will determine his cause of death. The autopsy will be performed on Thursday, reports ABC.

The child was 'a victim of violence,'
said Suffolk police Det. Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick, confirming there were 
signs of harm, including bruises.

He said the children was a student at a local school, which he would not identify, but they did not attend class Wednesday.

According to Ms Pitt's father, the 
biological mother of Adonis and his sister ran into financial 
difficulties and handed over the care of her children to his daughter, Adonis' 
godmother.

The boy's 6-year-old sister, who was at school at the time of the incident, was yesterday placed in the care of Social Services.

An autopsy is planned for Thursday at the Suffolk County medical examiner's office.

No further information was immediately available.

Suffolk police said that they believe that 911 emergency call reporting the child was made from the home, but they declined to disclose any details for the caller.

Det. Lt. Fitzpatrick said that the caller is incredibly important to their investigations and added that police were trying to contact family members and friends of the child's parents.

The neighborhood is described as a quiet residential street made up of single-family homes.

The 4-year-old was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip, where the child was pronounced dead, police said

Amityville is best known as the setting 
of the novel The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson, which was published in 
1977 and had been adapted into a series of films made between 1979 and 
2011.

The book was based on a true story, in December 1975, George and Kathy Lutz and Kathy's three children moved into 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch Colonial house in Amityville - which is 15 minutes walking distance away from the scene of yesterday's crime.

Thirteen months before the Lutzes moved in, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. had shot and killed six members of his family at the house. After 28 days, the Lutzes left the house, claiming to have been terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there.

The Amityville Horror: A True Story is a multi-million selling book by Jay Anson first published in September 1977.It is reported to be based on the real-life paranormal experiences of the Lutz family at 122 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch Colonial house in the Long Island town of Amityville, New York.The story is supposedly about the horrifying events the Lutz family endured over a period of 28 days after moving into a home where Ronald DeFeo Jr. had shot and killed six members of his family inside the home 13 months prior to their purchase.In December, 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the home one year and one month after the DeFeo murders for what they considered to be a bargain price of $80,000.They moved into the six bedroom home with their three children, Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and Melissa, 5 and their Malamute/Labrador cross called Harry.Because of the terrible past of the home, the Lutz's arranged for the home to be blessed and when the Catholic priest flicked holy water across the room, he heard a male voice deman that he 'get out'.After that and for the next 28 days, the Lutz's experienced many different and frightening episodes all linked to the paranormal.George would wake up around 3:15 every morning and would go out to check the boathouse. Later he would learn that this was the estimated time of the DeFeo killings.Kathy had vivid nightmares about the murders and discovered the order in which they occurred and the rooms where they took place.While tending to the fire, George and Kathy saw the image of a demon with half his head blown out. It was burned into the soot in the back of the fireplace.George would wake up to the sound of the front door slamming. He would race downstairs to find the dog sleeping soundly at the front door. Nobody else heard the sound although it was loud enough to wake the house.Kathy would feel a sensation as if 'being embraced' in a loving manner, by an unseen force.The book was written after Tam Mossman, an editor at the publishing house Prentice Hall, introduced George and Kathy Lutz to Jay Anson.However, soon after its publication, the Lutz's version of events came to be quesioned and speculation was rife that the entire novel was a work of fiction.George Lutz maintained that events in the book were 'mostly true' and denied any suggestion of dishonesty on his part. In June 1979, George and Kathy Lutz took a lie detector test relating to their experiences at the house, which they both passed.In May 2010, the house was placed on the market with an asking price of $1.15 million. In August 2010, the house was sold to a local resident for $950,000
