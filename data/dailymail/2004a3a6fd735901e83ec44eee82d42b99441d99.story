Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said he will not interfere in court rulings, a day after three Al-Jazeera journalists were sentenced to seven years in prison in a verdict that prompted an international outcry.

The ruling, on terrorism-related charges, stunned their families and brought a landslide of condemnation and calls for el-Sissi to intervene.

According to Egypt's constitution, the president has the right to issue a pardon or commute the sentences. U.S., Australian and other officials have urged el-Sissi to use this right to immediately release the journalists.

Defiant: Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has said he won't interfere in the court ruling of Al-Jazeera journalists

The trio were accused of supporting Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which the authorities have declared a terrorist organisation

Rights groups have described the trial as a politically motivated sham reflecting the tense relations between Egypt and the Qatar-owned station. Qatar has been a strong supporter of Islamists in the region and in particular Egypt's former president, Mohammed Morsi, overthrown by the military last summer.

Sounding a defiant tone, however, el-Sissi said he had always said he will not interfere in judicial affairs, and would respect the courts' independence.

He said he called the justice minister late Monday to repeat that sentiment, despite what he described as debate over the rulings against the journalists.

'I told him one word: We will not interfere in judicial matters because the Egyptian judiciary is an independent and exalted judiciary,' he told a military graduation ceremony in a nationally televised speech.

He also urged people to stop commenting or criticizing court rulings.

Repeating it again, he said: 'We will not interfere in court verdicts.'

El-Sissi said to ensure respect for state institutions, there should be no interference in their affairs.

'If we desire (strong) state institutions we must respect court rulings and not comment on them even if others don't understand these rulings,' he said.

El-Sissi's comments came at the end of a speech mostly devoted to economic affairs. 

David Cameron said that he was ‘completely appalled’ by the verdicts against former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, while Foreign Secretary William Hague summoned the Egyptian ambassador in London for crisis talks. 

The three were arrested in December as part of a sweeping crackdown on Islamist supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi.

The trio were accused of supporting Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which the authorities have declared a terrorist organisation.

They also faced charges of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's national security and make it appear the country was facing civil war.

The prosecution offered little evidence to back up the charges against them.

The journalists and their supporters have said they were simply doing their jobs, covering the wave of protests led by the Brotherhood against the military-backed government installed after Morsi was ousted on July 3 by then-army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who is now the president.

The police crackdown on the protests has killed hundreds and put thousands more in prison.

'I swear they will pay for this,' Fahmy shouted angrily from the defendants' cage after the sentences were announced. Greste raised his fists in the air.

'They just ruined a family,' said Fahmy's brother Adel, who was attending the session.

He said they would appeal against the verdict but added that he had little faith in the system. 'Everything is corrupt,' he said.

The judge also handed 10-year sentences to two British journalists and a Dutch journalist who were not in Egypt and were being tried in absentia.

Two defendants among 14 others on trial in the case were acquitted, including the son of Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood.

British ambassador James Watt, who was in court, said he was 'very disappointed' by the verdict.

'Freedom of expression is fundamental to any democracy,' he said.

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, speaking on a visit to Cairo, described the sentencing as ‘chilling and draconian’.

Conservative MPs called for an urgent review of UK and EU aid payments to Egypt. There were similar calls in the US, which has just handed Cairo a huge slice of foreign aid.

Tory Peter Bone said: ‘It’s fundamentally wrong to give taxpayers’ money to corrupt foreign governments that are imprisoning people for reporting facts. The Arab Spring is turning into a disaster.’

The other defendants were mainly students, arrested separately, accused of providing the Al Jazeera journalists with footage along with a variety of other charges, including belonging to the Brotherhood.

The latest official figures show that the UK gave £8.4 million to Egypt in 2012, mostly through the Foreign Office.

But Britain also contributes to a £4.2 billion EU aid package that was agreed in 2012

However, MPs also warned that, following the Leveson Inquiry, proposals for a form of state regulation of the British press made it more difficult for this country to lecture others about media freedoms.
