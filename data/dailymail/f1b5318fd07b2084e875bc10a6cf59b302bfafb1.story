Jordan Belfort, the real-life Wolf Of Wall Street who scammed investors out of $110 million in the 1990s, is shopping a reality TV show in which he helps people who've hit rock bottom.

The 'uplifting' show sees Belfort, 51, using his 'unique set of business skills' to help people get their lives on track and reach redemption, like he believes he has.

Belfort worked on the show with Electus  CEO Chris Grant who approached the former financier after reading his outrageous 2007 memoir, The Wolf Of Wall Street.

Grant runs the Ben Silverman-founded studio behind Fashion Star and Mob Wives.

'I knew without even seeing a picture of
 him that he could be a talent  both behind and in front of the camera,' Grant told The Hollywood Reporter.

Smitten by Belfort's drug-taking and hard-partying past, Grant tracked down the convicted fraudster.

After serving 22 months for his crimes, Belfort now works as a motivational speaker based out  of Manhattan 
Beach, California.

The pair then worked together to devise a pitch which Grant said has attracted a lot of interest.

Grant describes the reaction of several execs to Belfort’s made-for-reality personality: 'He was described to  us after leaving the room as ‘TV gold'.'
