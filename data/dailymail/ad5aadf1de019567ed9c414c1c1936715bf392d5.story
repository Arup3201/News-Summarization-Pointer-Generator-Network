The Africa Cup of Nations is scheduled to begin on January 17 despite fears surrounding the threat of Ebola.

Morocco, who will host the 2015 tournament, had asked for the bi-annual competition to be pushed back in order to protect the lives of supporters.

The Ebola virus has already taken the life of 5,000 people in West Africa and host nation Morocco were fearful that the tournament could put more people in danger.

The Africa Cup of Nations will go ahead as planned despite the recent Ebola outbreak

Nigeria won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations which was held in South Africa

However following discussions between Moroccan officials and the Confederation of African Football (CAF), it has been revealed that the tournament will take place as originally planned.

Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) media director Junior Binyam said: 'CAF confirms the dates of the tournament.

'Any change of dates would be to the detriment of the CAF calendar, which must follow FIFA's international calendar.'
