One of the victims of the Asiana Airlines crash left a poignant final message on her microblogging account before she joined her classmates on Flight 214 to San Francisco.

Wang Linjia, 16, was among a group of injured passengers who were not found by rescuers until 14 minutes after the crash nine days ago.

Her final online posting read: 'Give yourself some affirmation, you're stronger than you 
think. It's only called youth because it's painful. I always feel like 
there's not enough time, yet I have no idea where my time goes.'

Tragic: Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, are two of the three Chinese students killed the crash landing

The three schoolgirls who died following the crash have been described as star students by those back home in Zhejiang province in eastern China.

They were on their way to a Christian summer camp in California where they planned to practice their English and improve their chances of getting into an American college.

Wang, described by neighbours as quiet, courteous and hardwarking, excelled in physics and calligraphy.

Her father proudly displayed her calligraphy and artwork on his office walls, AP reports.

Confident and popular, she worked as a student reporter and served as a class monitor for three years.

Liu Yipeng, 15, died on Friday after six days in intensive care

Wang and her close friend Ye Mengyuan, also 16, died on the day of the crash at San Francisco International Airport.

The girls had been 'inseparable' since middle school, with photographs posted online showing them smiling and mugging for the camera while dressed in their school tracksuits.

Ye was a champion 
athlete who excelled at literature, playing the piano, singing and 
public speaking.

She had recently won a national aerobics competition, local media said, and routinely received honors at the school's annual speech contests.

After her death, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV released footage showing Ye playing the piano at an event earlier this year.

Her given name means 'wish come true' in Chinese.

Ye had been badly injured in the 
crash and was lying on the runway when she was hit by a fire truck on its way to help rescue efforts.

She was hidden under flame-retardant foam that had been sprayed over the runway.

It is not yet clear if Ye survived the crash and died from her injuries from being hit by the fire truck.

The third victim Liu Yipeng, 15, died on Friday after six days in intensive care.

She was rescued from her seat on the Boeing 777 jetliner and was hospitalized with severe head and abdominal injuries.

She has been described as a standout student in math, physics and essay writing as well as a fan of video games.

Friends have posted pictures of her holding a microphone and speaking to camera on the school's television station.

The three girls were students at the Jiangshan Middle School in the 
relatively wealthy eastern province of Zhejiang and had been traveling 
to the U.S. to attend a summer camp, visit college campuses and do some 
sightseeing.

Charred: Asiana Flight 214 burst into flames after crash landing July 6 at San Francisco International Airport

Such tours are well beyond the means of 
most Chinese, but have become popular among the newly emerging middle 
class as a way of improving their children's English and preparing them 
for possible enrollment in an American college.

Their parents were flown to San Francisco after their deaths where the Chinese consulate was caring for them.

The crash-landing occurred after the airliner collided with a rocky seawall just short of the runway.

Dozens of passengers were hurt. There were 182 survivors taken to hospitals, though most suffered only minor injuries.

So
 far, an investigation indicates the pilots, a trainee and his 
instructor, failed to realize until too late that the aircraft was 
dangerously low and flying too slow.

Asiana Airlines said today that it would enhance training for pilots seeking to convert to flying new aircraft, part of a series of measures it is undertaking after the fatal crash of an Boeing 777 plane in San Francisco.

Miracle: Despite the cabin bursting into flames, only three people have so far been identified as dead

Nothing
 disclosed so far by the National Transportation Safety Board 
investigators indicates any problems with the Boeing 777's engines, 
computers or automated systems.Â 

The pilot in charge of landing the plane was in training on the 777, while seated next to him was a co-pilot on his first flight as an instructor.

Both were experienced pilots, although they had not flown together before, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said.

Currently Asiana pilots have to fly 10 flights and a total of 60 hours on a 777 to complete its training programme.

Pilot Lee Kang-kuk, a veteran who had nearly 10,000 hours of total flying experience, had completed eight flights and 43 hours on the Boeing 777, a spokesman said.

He had flown Airbus planes before switching to the Boeing 777.

The new measures will include enhancing training for visual approach and automated flight and conducting flight inspection on airports which are 'vulnerable to safety.'

Panic: As fire trucks rushed to the scene, one may have hit and killed Liu Yipeng, 15, in the chaotic aftermath

The pilots aboard the Boeing 777 made a visual approach to San Francisco airport, and relied on automatic equipment to maintain airspeed.

Asiana said it will also seek to improve communications skills among crew members, and introduce a system to manage 'fatigue risk.'

Other measures include setting up separate maintenance teams for Boeing and Airbus planes, and enhancing safety management systems.

Meanwhile, the carrier said on Monday that it planned to sue U.S. television station KTVU for reporting racially offensive fake names for the pilots of the Asiana flight.

'The KTVU report that not only disparaged Asians in general through the use of racially charged epithets, but also severely damaged the reputation of Asiana Airlines,' it said.
