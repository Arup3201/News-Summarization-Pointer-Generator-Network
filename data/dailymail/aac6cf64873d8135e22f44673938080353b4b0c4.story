Maurice Blackburn lawyer Andrew Watson is fighting for customers to get the difference between charges for credit card late fees and the true cost to the bank

A multimillion-dollar payout could be handed to customers hit with excessive credit card fees in the biggest class action in Australian history.

The class action to claw back excessive late payment charges of up to $35 could potentially impact hundreds of thousands of customers of Australia's biggest banks.

Law firm Maurice Blackburn is filing lawsuits against ANZ, Westpac and Citibank in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

The action is set to take in Westpac subsidiaries St George and BankSA.

It is expected similar lawsuits against NAB, American Express, the Commonwealth Bank and subsidiary BankWest will follow, bringing the number of affected banks to nine.

The action against the banks will see all of their customers who have been slugged with excessive late fees automatically included in the claim.

This makes it hard to predict the potential payout amount although if successful it is expected to be in the hundreds of millions.

There is no time limit on how far back claimants can go to recoup their fees, yet ANZ will ask the court to impose a limit next week.

Maurice Blackburn lawyer Andrew Watson said bank customers should not be subjected to the excessive credit card late fees, which vary from $5 for NAB customers to $20 at the Commonwealth Bank, reported Yahoo!7.

'We'll be alleging as we have in our earlier case against the ANZ that the late payment fees are penalties and excessive, and customers should get the difference between what they were charged and the true cost to the bank,' he said.

Unlike previous bank class actions which were 'closed classes' and meant victims needed to register to be involved, the current action is an 'open class'.

More than 180,000 customers have already registered, which could result in a $223 million payout.

Maurice Blackburn has previously had a partial victory  against ANZ in a Federal Court case running for about four years and has filed similar class actions the Commonwealth Bank, NAB, Westpac and Citibank.

The class action is the biggest in Australian history and aims to claw back excessive credit card late fees of up to $35

In February, Justice Michelle Gordon found ANZ's credit card late fees of up to $35 were 'extravagant and unconscionable' as the cost to the bank was a low as 50 cents and that the fee was a penalty.

She also waived the standard six-year time limit for legal action so there were no constraints on claiming late fees beyond this period as customers did not know the bank's fees were unlawful until the lawsuit was filed in 2010.

Yet she did throw out claims against the bank that overlimit and dishonour fees were excessive.

Exception fees net the banks billions of dollars, with late credit card fees making up about 25 per cent of this amount.

In 2012, the High Court ruled as part of the bank fee action that it was possible for bank fees to be penalties.

ANZ and Maurice Blackburn will challenge the original credit card late fee ruling in the Federal Court on Monday.

Although the exact amount of victims is not known, if successful the payout could be in the hundreds of millions

If the law firm is successful and the court strikes down additional bank fees, it is expected the firm will lodge more class action suits and this could see the payout amount increase.

Yet if ANZ wins, the lawsuit filed today would be quashed.

In a third possible scenario, if the decision previously made to waive the usual six-year limit is overturned,  the amount claimed by victims could be cut.

New lawsuits by Maurice Blackburn will be financed by litigation funder Bentham IMF, which will take 22.5 per cent of any winnings, pending court approval.

Without the funding, a source close to the lawsuit said it would have been impossible to run the bank fee cases because each victim's losses total a few thousand dollars in most cases.

This amount is too small warrant costly individual court cases against the banks, which are some of the biggest companies in the country.
