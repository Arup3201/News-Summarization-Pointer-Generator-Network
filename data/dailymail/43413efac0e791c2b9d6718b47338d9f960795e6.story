In your social circles, there will likely be friends you love spending time with, those who calm you down, and others that you know are a bad influence.

And now an app can reveal exactly how these different people make you feel, including which friends you should cut out of your life for good.

Called pplkpr, pronounced 'people keeper', it syncs with a heart rate monitor to track and log subtle changes in emotional state when you’re around these people.

The pplkpr app (right) syncs with a Bluetooth heart rate monitor (left) to track emotions. When the monitor spots a change in heart rate, the app alerts the user. It asks the wearer to explain how they're feeling and who they're with, and over time, an algorithm learns the difference between the varying heart rates

And in doing so, it can even tell you which friends could be damaging your health.

The free iOS app was created by Brooklyn-based artists Kyle McDonald and Lauren McCarthy, and was recently tested on a group of students at Carnegie Mellon University.

Pplkpr pairs up with any Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitor, although the students were given Mio devices during the test.

From this list, the free iOS app ranks friendships based on different emotions (left). The app can then reveal which friends should be avoided during times of stress, it can block people who make the wearer anxious (right), or send text messages to people who make the wearer happy or calm

Using GPS, the app also notifies wearers when they change locations, to ask if they’ve just left, or are about to meet someone. The measurements are based on a metric called ‘heart rate variability’ (example pictured), where subtle changes in heart rhythm signal changes in an emotional state. This is fed into an algorithm

Called pplkpr, or People Keeper, it syncs with a heart rate monitor to track subtle changes in emotional state.

Pplkpr notifies the wearer when it detects heightened emotion, and asks them to report how they’re feeling.

Using GPS, it also notifies them when they change locations, to ask if they’ve just left, or are about to meet someone.

The measurements are based on a metric called ‘heart rate variability’, where subtle changes in heart rhythm signal changes in an emotional state.

Pplkpr knows when the wearer is experiencing a strong emotion, but lets them decide what that emotion is.

Once established, pplkpr can write text messages, invite people to hang out, or block or delete contacts. 

All of these actions are shown on the home screen before they take place.

It tracks and logs changes in heart rate and, when it notices a shift, asks the user to explain how they’re feeling, where they are and who they’re with.

Over time, an algorithm built into the app can then learn which emotions the subtle changes in heart rate relate to.

From this list, the app tracks which people make the wearer happy, who calms them down, and the people who cause the most fear or stress.

This has a number of benefits, according to the developers. 

It can reveal which friends should be avoided during times of stress, for example.

It can also block or unfriend people who make the wearer anxious or bored, or will message those who make them happy, or calm.

‘Pplkpr uses GPS and a heart rate wristband to keep track of when you're coming and going, and when you're feeling emotional,’ said the developers.

‘[It] implements a complex metric called “heart rate variability" that uses subtle changes in heart rhythm to determine your emotional state.

'This data is correlated with the people you interact with to determine who should be auto-scheduled into your life and who should be removed.’

Ms McCarthy and Mr McDonald came up with the app to explore quantified living in relationships, and how people interact.

And for people who don’t have a heart rate monitor, the app also lets them add manual emotional readings.
