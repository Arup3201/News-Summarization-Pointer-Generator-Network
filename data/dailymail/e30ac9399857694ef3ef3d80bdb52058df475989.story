Victim: Amanullah Aman was shot down by the Taliban in Kunduz, north Afghanistan, at 8.45am (5.15am GMT) today

The Taliban has shot down a senior Afghan official - before bragging about the shooting on Twitter.

Two gunmen riding on motorcycles assassinated Amanullah Aman, the head of a provincial election commission in Kunduz, north Afghanistan, at 8.45am (5.15am GMT) today, according to police.

Just an hour later, Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, took to Twitter to publicise the attack.

'At 9am this morning, engineer Mohammad Aman, head of Kunduz Independent Election Commission, was killed by our Majahedeen in Takharistan area of Kunduz city', the Tweet read.

The shooting is believed to be the first insurgent attack on an official of the Independent Election Commission in recent years.

It came as Afghanistan's campaign season started this week, with authorities accepting candidate nominations for presidential and provincial elections next spring.

Mr Aman, who has run the commission's Kunduz office since 2003, had been collecting rent from shopkeepers in a Kunduz city bazaar, where he owns property, when he was shot three times in the chest by the passing gunmen.

He was taken to hospital, but later died, according to Hamidullah Daneshi, the deputy governor of Kunduz province.

Responsibility: An hour after the attack, Zabiullah Mujahid tweeted: 'At 9am this morning, engineer Mohammad Aman, head of Kunduz Independent Election Commission, was killed by our Majahedeen in Takharistan area of Kunduz city'

Mr Aman is believed to be the 
highest-ranking election official to be killed in the country since the 
Taliban government was ousted in 2001.

In a phone call, Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the shooting. However, a spokesman for the commission in Kabul said it was too early to conclude who was behind Mr Aman's death.

'We will wait until the investigation is completed by the security organs and then say who was behind this attack,' spokesman Noor Ahmad Noor told the New York Times.

Today, Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, saying it would not dampen the determination of the Afghan people to vote.

'The Taliban commit such acts to prevent
our people from becoming empowered and developed, so that the 
foreigners can determine our destiny,' he said.

The Taliban often target Afghan government officials in their bid to return to power since being toppled by U.S.-led forces.

'It's a big loss for us,' said Sareer Ahmad Barmak, a member of the national election commission, referring to Mr Aman's killing.

The election for president, as well as for provincial council members, is not until April 5 - however, candidates have been able to declare themselves for president since Monday.

It is considered a key test for Afghanistan and its ability to maintain 
its democracy as the U.S.-led international coalition finishes 
withdrawing its troops next year.
