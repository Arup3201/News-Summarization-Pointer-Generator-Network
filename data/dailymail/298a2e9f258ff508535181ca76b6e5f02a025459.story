Christians are frightened to reveal their religious beliefs to colleagues at work, equality chiefs admit.

When they do declare their Christianity, whether in the office or on the shop floor, they are often mocked or treated like bigots – and their children are even ridiculed at school.

Christians also think their faith is being pushed out of its role as a cornerstone of life in Britain, according to a major study by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

And ironically, many feel they are being persecuted by the same anti-discrimination and equality laws supported by the equality watchdog.

Persecuted: The study of 2,500 people found many of the Christians who took part felt they needed to hide their faith at work or at school, for fear of being called bigots or being mocked

Nearly 2,500 people of all faiths were quizzed about religion at work for the nationwide study. It follows years of conflict over Christians’ right to act in accordance with their religious beliefs.

A series of high-profile court battles have left many feeling that the law is tilted against them and that gay rights trump their own.

Many of the major test cases have been backed by the equality commission itself, including the successful Supreme Court case brought by a gay couple against hoteliers Peter and Hazelmary Bull, who declined to rent them a room because they were not married.

The commission is currently backing a legal claim against a Belfast-based Christian-run bakery that wouldn’t bake a cake bearing a slogan that supported gay marriage.

Of those who responded to the commission’s survey, 1,030 said they were Christian. The next largest group –188 – were atheist. People of other faiths made up the rest.

The commission’s report said: ‘A recurring theme among some employees was the pressure they felt they were under to keep their religion hidden at work and feeling discriminated against when it came to wearing religious symbols or expressing their beliefs. This was particularly felt by Christians.

‘People reported being mocked for their beliefs, including Christians, who said their colleagues assumed they were bigoted. Some Christian-run services or businesses said they felt in turmoil about behaving in ways that they feared might breach the Equality Act 2010, which protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in access to goods and services.’ 

There were also protests from some humanists and atheists, the report said, including complaints there were no humanist chaplains at hospitals. Several atheists felt left out if they worked for companies that staged events in churches.

Commission chief executive Mark Hammond said of the survey: ‘What came out strongly was the widespread confusion about the law, leading to some resentment and tensions between groups, and anxiety for employers who fear falling foul of what they see as complicated equality and human rights legislation.’

He said that the commission would produce new guidance to ‘help everyone address some of the issues’. 

Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute – a think tank that has supported opponents of the commission in court – said: ‘It is a relief that the commission is beginning to realise there is a problem.’

But he added: ‘It would help if it admitted that it may have been part of the problem. In many cases the commission has aggressively promoted cases against innocent Christians like Peter and Hazelmary Bull.

‘There was an appalling case a few years ago when a commission lawyer referred to the spread of Christian views using the word “infected”. It is going to have to do an awful lot of work to rebuild confidence among Christians and persuade them that it does not regard secularism as the solution to all problems.’
