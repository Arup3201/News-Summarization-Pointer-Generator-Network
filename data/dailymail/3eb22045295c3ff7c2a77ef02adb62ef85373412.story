A brother and sister who were separated into different Chicago foster homes as
children in 1948 have met for the first time, thanks to the detective work of a
friendly 7-year-old neighbor

Betty Billadeau, of St Louis, Missouri, and Clifford Boyson, of Davenport, Iowa, were introduced after 65 years apart yesterday, AbcNews reports.

The pair were put into separate foster homes at age five and three 
respectively and spent decades trying to find each other to no avail.

Delighted: Betty Billadeau and Clifford Boyson have been reunited after spending 65 years apart. The siblings were put in touch with one another after a 7-year-old neighbor used Facebook

Separated: The brother and sister who now live miles apart were put into separate foster homes in Chicago as children

But with the help of Mr Boyson's tech-savvy neighbour, Eddie Hanzelin, 7, and his 
enterprising plan to track Ms Billadeau using his mother's Facebook account they are now a 
family again.

'Nobody would help me until I came and met little Eddie,' Mr Boyson told AbcNews.

'One thing he said is that he has someone to send a Christmas card to now,' Ms Billadeau said of her brother.

Their reunion was all thanks to Eddie, whose father Glenn Hanzelin, is 
Mr Boyson's landlord. Mr Boyson told Eddie the story of his sister so he 
decided to try Facebook.

'I went on Facebook and I typed in Boyson,' he said. 'There were a whole
bunch of pictures that showed up. One of them kind of looked like 
Clifford and I zoomed in on it and it started to really look like 
Clifford, [so] I showed it to my mom and dad.'

Tech-savvy: Eddie Hanzelin, 7, was the mastermind behind the family reunion. He found Ms Billadeau by searching for her maiden name and tracking down relatives

New friends: Betty Billadeau and Clifford Boyson were so grateful for the help of Eddie Hanzelin. They now plan to meet up on a regular basis

His parents made contact with Ms Billadeau's daughter and so the plan for a reunion was born.

The siblings chatted online before their first face-to-face introduction.

At the meeting in Iowa yesterday, Mr Boyson presented his sister, who traveled 
with her daughter and granddaughter, with flowers and was overcome with 
emotion.

'You’re about the same height mom was', he said tearfully to his older sibling.

7-year-old sleuth: Eddie Hanzelin used his mother's Facebook account to reunite the siblings. He said 'family is important'

Social network: Boyson's 7-year-old neighbor found Ms Billadeau on Facebook after a week of searching and found her by using her maiden name

Ms Billadeau said that finding her brother repaired a hole in her heart.

The two now plan to continue meeting up - with Ms Billadeau set to introduce her brother to his extended family in Missouri.

Eddie is hopeful Mr Boyson will still have time for their friendship though.

'He’s never been on vacation,' he said. 'And I want him to go on vacation to Disney World with me.'

And the moral of the story according to the 7 year old detective.

'Family is important,' he told the broadcaster.
