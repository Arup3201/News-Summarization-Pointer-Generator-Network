A teenage boy has died after stumbling out of bed, falling into a sunbed and severing his jugular vein on one of its glass tubes.

Grant Adams, 17, died in hospital last night after the freak accident in which the smashed tubes cut his neck in two places at his home in South Shields, Tyne and Wear.

Today his mother, Amanda Smedley, 39, described how she found her son - whose girlfriend is due to have their baby in a fortnight - at the bottom of the loft stairs with blood pumping out of his throat.

She said: 'He stumbled out of bed, tripped, and the bottom of the sunbed tubes went into his neck.

'He's pulled it out of his neck, he's stumbled down the loft stairs, [and] I found him in a pool of blood.'

Miss Smedley's boyfriend tried to staunch the blood pouring from Grant's neck while she called for help for her son.

Much-loved son: Grant was described by his mother, Amanda Stedley, 39, as 'good at everything he ever did'

Paramedics arrived and the young bricklayer was airlifted to hospital and put in an induced coma, but despite medics working on him in theatre for five hours, Grant could not be saved and was pronounced dead last night.

His mother said: 'It's his 18th birthday in two weeks' time, he had just bought a car, he has got a baby on the way - he had everything to live for, everything.'

She said her son's pregnant girlfriend had left the house shortly before the accident on Sunday, and said she was 'a mess' after learning of the tragedy.

Miss Smedley added: 'The only thing I have got left of him is his baby.  That's it.

'He was a happy, go-lucky fun loving lad, and all he did was work, sleep, work, sleep.  He was good at everything he ever did - I cannot believe he is gone.'

Grant's aunt, Michelle Kelly, 33, who described him as a 'big healthy lad' who loved cars and motorbikes, told how she rushed to help him from her home nearby.

She said: 'I got a knock on the door and I dashed over to help. 

'Grant had pulled a bit of the glass tube out of his neck already and I held my hand over his neck to try and stop the flow of blood.

'The ambulance came and took him to hospital where they took him into surgery to close the wounds up and put him into an induced coma as he wasn't able to breathe.'

Friends of Grant, a keen amateur boxer, paid tribute to him on Facebook.

One, Danny Lythgoe, wrote: 'Absolutely devastated, man, known you since we were four years old.  Went to nursery with you and had so many memories.

'Been my longest and most trustworthy mate I've had, could depend on you for anything.'

Michael Elliot wrote: 'RIP Grant Adams, such a nice lad.  Thoughts are with your friends and family and everyone who knew you.'

And Glenn Fyall wrote: 'I think you’ve shown everyone how precious life is and that the meaning of it is not something to brush off, we need to appreciate life and make it the best we can

'I think its fair to say every single one of your friends and family is heartbroken that you’re not here, but hopefully we will all see you again one day.'
