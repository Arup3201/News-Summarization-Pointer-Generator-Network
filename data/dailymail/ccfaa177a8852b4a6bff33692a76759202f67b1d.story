Jill Kelley, the woman made famous for triggering the investigation that ended with General David Petraeus' resignation as head of the CIA, is taking small steps back into public life.

The Florida socialite and her husband Scott helped pass out Thanksgiving meals for their charity Heart for the Homeless Thursday, after being forced to skip the event last year due to the public attention involving the scandal.

Last year, Kelley complained to a contact at the FBI about cyber-stalking which revealed an affair between Petraeus and his biographer, Paula Broadwell.

'We could not leave the house in light of the scandal. We had to take a year off. It was sad that these people suffered,' Kelley told the New York Post's Page Six.

Back in public life: Socialite Jill Kelley handed out Thanksgiving dinners to homeless vets on Thursday as part of her re-entry to the Tampa social scene

'Many of these homeless men are young vets who just got back from Afghanistan. They are living in their cars . . . The homeless population has changed dramatically. One [man] had been a fighter pilot,' Kelley added

Kelley's return to the Tampa social scene coincides with her recent lawsuit against top US officials, accusing them of a 'smear campaign'.

Kelley and her husband originally filed a lawsuit last June on the grounds that the FBI and Department of Defense violated the federal privacy act by leaking their personal information to the press.

News breaker: Kelley became a part of the news last year when her reports of cyber-stalking revealed an affair between General David Petraeus and author Paula Broadwell, which brought his career as CIA chief to an end

But in this new lawsuit, the Kelleys claim that their names, emails and personal information were leaked to the press following Petraeus' resignation on November 9, 2012.

Among those named are Deputy FBI Director Sean Joyce, former bureau director Robert Mueller, Attorney General Eric Holder and other top officials who Kelley claims made decisions on the investigation into the Petraeus scandal 'based on the timing of the 2012 presidential election', NBC reported.

Jill Kelley was under intense media scrutiny at the time of Petraeus' resignation due to her reputation for throwing parties for military and intelligence big wigs at her Tampa home near MacDill Air Force Base - headquarters of U.S. Central Command.

Fighting back: Kelley and her husband Scott recently filed a lawsuit against top US officials accusing them of releasing their private information to the press following Petraeus' resignation

The leaks placed the socialite in the middle of an avalanche of unfavorable publicity and as a result, she shouldered the blame as the villain in the downfall of Petraeus and General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit reads: '[T]he government was not legally entitled to treat the Kelleys’ like criminals, pry into and disclose their personal communications, violate their privacy, and disseminate confidential records as well as false information about them.'

In September, the Obama administration sought to dismiss the lawsuit. The Justice Department declined to comment to NBC on Friday about the amended lawsuit. 

The suit claims the leaks violated the Privacy Act, which was enacted in 1974 after revelations of illegal surveillance by federal agencies in the Watergate scandal.

The Justice Department said in a court filing that Kelley has failed to present any facts suggesting that the FBI and the Pentagon flagrantly disregarded her privacy rights.

In an act that triggered the criminal probe resulting in Petraeus' forced resignation, Kelley told the FBI in May 2012 that she and several U.S. top military officers had been the recipients of anonymous harassing emails.

Kelley and her husband 'sought to do the right thing by reporting the facts' to the FBI, the lawsuit says.

But 'rather than protect the Kelleys' privacy interests as the law and their duty required, defendants instead willfully and maliciously thrust the Kelleys into the maw of public scrutiny concerning one of the most widely reported sex scandals to rock the United States government'.

Some of the anonymous emails ultimately traced to Paula Broadwell were sent to Allen.

Allegations: The suit says the FBI did not provide Kelley the security protection a victim is entitled to because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the upcoming presidential election

The messages included notes on the general's plans to see Kelley in Washington the following week.

Allen was concerned about how anyone else would know about his personal plans.

One email mentioned Petraeus and an upcoming social event and military and intelligence meeting with NATO leaders in Washington.

The emails to the generals claimed Kelley was up to no good and impugned her motives for befriending the military leaders.

The lawsuit says the U.S. government 'unforgivably transformed Mrs Kelley's reputation from that of a respected business and community leader'.

According to the lawsuit, the FBI Washington cyber division and FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce directed agents in the Tampa Field office to treat the Kelleys' case differently than normal criminal investigations.

For example, the suit says, the FBI did not provide Kelley with security protection to which a victim is entitled because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the upcoming presidential election.

The lawsuit also says the FBI in Washington directed investigating agents not to proceed with a scheduled effort to interview Broadwell once the agents had determined she was the stalker.

Government officials violated the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches in its review of Kelley's emails, the suit claims.

It alleges they have suffered financial losses because of the government's actions. They are seeking monetary damages and an apology, among other things.

In the fallout from the scandal, Kelley was stripped of her role as a honorary consul for South Korea.

She was forced to return her vanity car registration plates and banned from MacDill Airforce Base.
