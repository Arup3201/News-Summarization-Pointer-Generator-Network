The TSA has been accused of rudely failing to help a mute stroke victim, meaning she had to take a an eight-hour bus ride.

Heidi Wright, who has been unable to speak for ten years, had been due to fly from LAX to Phoenix on Wednesday last week but was stopped by an agent who allegedly asked her to say her name.

The family claim that a TSA official demanded that the disabled woman say her name as he sought additional ID because she had only a photocopy of an expired driver's license.

However TSA officials insist that Miss Wright was not allowed to board the flight because she did not have valid ID - having provided only a poor photocopy of an expired driving license - and not because she as unable to say her name.

Barred: Heidi Wright, who was left unable to speak after a stroke, was prevented from boarding a flight

Ms Wright's sister Sherry claimed the official was rude and insensitive, and said she was left distraught by their experience

'I was just standing there, tears were coming out and I was like, "Are you serious? We can’t get her to talk",' Sherry Wright told ABC 7.

She claimed the confrontation happened after she presented the official with additional ID because of the expired driver's license.

'I showed her ID, her social and her DMV papers,' Ms Wright said, adding: 'He just wanted me to make my sister talk, and I couldn't believe it.'

The family claim they had contacted the airline before the flight to check what documents Heidi would need, and to alert the airport that a disabled passenger would be traveling.

Another of the stroke victim's sisters had been waiting in Phoenix to collect her, and take over as the woman's primary carer.

However, a spokesman for the airport, which processes 1.8 million passengers a day, of all abilities, says they were not given advance notice that the disabled passenger would need help.

An official with knowledge of the incident told Mail Online: 'The traveler was not denied access to the sterile area because the passenger couldn’t speak. Valid photo ID is required.'

The source said Ms Wright had presented staff with a photocopy of her social security card and photocopy of an expired California state ID that had expired in 2012.

'The photo on the California ID photocopy was so dark the face was indistinguishable,' the official said.

If the family had been able to provide a
 valid ID - even if that meant going home to fetch one and catching a 
later flight - then Ms Wright would have been allowed to board a plane.

The TSA website states clearly what ID is required for travelers, and LAX airport staff are experienced in helping passengers of all abilities.

It also has a dedicated service to help passengers with disabilities, though the TSA says that this service was not requested by the Wright family.
