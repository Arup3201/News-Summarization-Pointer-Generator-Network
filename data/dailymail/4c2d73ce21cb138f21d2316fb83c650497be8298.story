Ms Jordan, left, was the first black presenter of BBC's Blue Peter when she joined John Leslie, centre and Anthea Turner, right, on the long-running children's television show where she remained for six years 

According to The Sun, Justine told her estranged husband and his girlfriend to leave the house and Ms Jordan turned up where there was allegedly a row. 

Her alleged victim said: 'Diane was being very aggressive, poking and pushing me. She was in my face saying you're scum, you're scum.

'I felt threatened and called police. She grabbed my wrist and twisted it round. She pushed me into a cupboard to get the phone out of my hand. Then she grabbed it off me and told the police I was lying.' 

Ms Jordan said: 'I want to categorically state that the allegations made by the woman are manifestly untrue. Due to ongoing court proceedings involving my daughter, I am unable to make much further comment.' 

Ms Jordan adopted her daughter, who was originally her niece when she was aged two, when Ms Jordan's sister died suddenly. 

Ms Jordan became the first ever black presenter on BBC's flagship children's programme Blue Peter in 1990. 

She remained on the show for six years and after she left she was asked by the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown to sit on the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Committee. 

She later became the regular presenter on BBC Radio 2's The Sunday Hour show as well as regularly appearing on Songs of Praise. 

When she took over The Sunday Hour role, she said: 'I feel both privileged and excited about being invited to present such an established and much-loved BBC gem.'

Peter Duncan was a popular presenter during the 1980s performing daring stunts on screen 

Peter Duncan was the presenter who put the 'blue' into Blue Peter after details of his early career as a soft-porn actor emerged in 1984. 

Almost a decade earlier, as a 21-year-old, Mr Duncan starred in a low-budget porn film called 'The Lifetaker'. 

When copies of the movie surfaced, Mr Duncan quit the show, before filming 'Duncan Dares'. He later returned to Blue Peter for a further year.   

Michael Sundin presented the show in the 1980s until a video of him  as a nightclub stripper emerged

Michael Sundin joined Blue Peter after Peter Duncan left and was a noted acrobat and former World Trampoline champion. 

However, Sundin only lasted nine months on the show after a video, filmed in the Hippodrome Night Club in London showed him removing all his clothes during a raunchy on-stage performance. 

Sundin danced on a Rick Astley pop video in 1989 and died later that year of an Aids-related illness.

As the scandal emerged, Bacon was forced out and the head of children's TV programming said 'he has not only let himself and the team down, but he has let you all down'. 

He has since rebuilt his career and reputation and is a regular radio presenter.  

John Leslie was presenting This Morning when a rival TV channel named him in connection with the rape of  Ulrika Jonsson who claimed she was attacked by a fellow celebrity who she refused to name in her book

John Leslie was dropped by ITV's This Morning when an allegation linking him to the alleged rape of Ulrika Jonsson after she had written about an attack involving an unnamed celebrity in her book. 

His name circulated widely in media circles as the alleged attacker and was then blurted out live on air by Matthew Wright on his morning talk show. 

Leslie never faced any charges in connection with this allegation. However he was later charged with two indecent assaults against a 23-year-old woman.

He was found not guilty following a trial and left the court 'without a stain on his reputation'.  

While appearing on Blue Peter during the 1990s Anthea Turner had a squeaky clean image 

Anthea Turner presented the show between 1992 and 1994 before going on to present The National Lottery. 

At the time she was widely viewed as a 'sweetheart' to the nation. But the gloss from her pristine reputation was tarnished after she sold the rights to her marriage to Grant Bovey to a chocolate company which used the event as an advertisement. 

The sponsorship deal, which featured cheesy photographs of the ceremony. The couple later split over claims that Bovey had an extra-marital affair.
