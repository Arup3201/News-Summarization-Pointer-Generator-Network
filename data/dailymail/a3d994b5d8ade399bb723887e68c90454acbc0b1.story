An Elvis super-fan was left all shook up after her dream trip to Graceland ended in a horror fall and a disastrous cock-up by her personal injury lawyers. 

Shaunna Baynes, 42, claims she suffered a broken nose and hip damage after stumbling over a sleeping British Airways worker in the business class section of her flight back home.

The mother-of-one had been returning from a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, USA, as part of a 40th birthday trip paid for by kind-hearted hubby of 10 years Mark Baynes, 54, a train technician.

Mrs Baynes, who lives in Dagenham, Essex, fell just hours from landing at London Heathrow as she walked down the gangway to the toilets. 

She said: 'A few hours before we landed I got up to go to the toilet. I was walking down the aisle when I fell face first over the steward.

'I think in business class they have sleeping compartments but he was lying right across the aisle.

'I just wasn't expecting him to be there - who would be?

'An old lady, bless her, helped me up. She was the only person that did and I saw him there laying on the floor asleep. He didn't even wake up.

'Apparently he was asleep because he was disorientated but at the end of the day if that's the case then why was he up in the air?

'It had been a fantastic holiday until I hit the floor. I doubt I'll ever fly again.'

'I just worry what would have happened if it had been her or a pregnant woman.

'I feel lucky really as I could have done myself a lot more harm. It put a real dampener on what had been an amazing experience out in Graceland.

'I'm just relieved it didn't happen on the way there.'

Mrs Baynes claims she suffered a broken nose, ligament damage in her right arm and soft tissue damage on her hip following the fall, which left her in a mobility scooter for six weeks.

She had been on the final leg of her return from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Heathrow on November 3, 2012, when the accident happened.

Two days after she got home from the trip, she contacted Peter Cornish at specialist personal injury solicitors Amwells in Islington, north London, in order to claim compensation from BA.

But the specialists failed to lodge a lawsuit in time, meaning Shaunna was awarded a £2,000 payout from them instead of receiving compensation from the airline. 

Mr Cornish believed he had three years to take action, as in normal personal injury claims, but was unaware that there is a two-year limitation with cases in the air.

The solicitor, who has dealt with personal injury claims for 13 years, admitted his mistake and his company paid her instead.

He said: 'She's a nice lady and I made an error as a lawyer, which I wouldn't usually do.

'It was because of the two-year limitation period, so I said we're happy to pay up for this.'

Mrs Baynes, a former school dinner lady, had to retire early due to crippling osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.

She said: 'It's never been about the money for me - I just want British Airways to accept what they did and apologise.

'A supervisor apologised to me at the time but I said to her "It's not your place to say sorry, the guy who was sleeping there should be apologising".

'I've not had any correspondence from BA since the accident - not an apology, not anything.

'I know it was a freak accident but it could have easily been avoided. I just don't want anyone to have to go through the same thing.'

Mrs Baynes is a huge fan of the entertainer known as The King.

She said: 'I've been brought up with Elvis all my life.

'I've got more than a thousand different Elvis bits - from t-shirts to belts, films, teddy bears, everything really.

'Going to Graceland was a childhood dream come true. I cried when I got there as I couldn't believe it was actually happening.

'Even with everything that happened on the flight home it was still an amazing trip.'

A spokesman for British Airways said: 'We are sorry that Ms Baynes hurt herself during one of our flights.

'We investigated the claims and could not find any evidence to support them.'
