Jailed: Forrest was told he had 'ignored the cardinal rule of teaching'

The schoolgirl lover of jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest has been left ‘devastated’ after she was banned from making contact with him until she reaches adulthood.

The girl, who was 15 when she fled to France with Forrest, vowed to wait for him ‘for ever’ when he was jailed in June and has made several attempts to contact him in prison.

But now, as part of an ongoing serious case review, it has been decided there should be no contact between the couple until she is at least 18.

The ruling was made by a team including social worker Sarah Spain, currently in a relationship with one of the investigating officers in the case, Graeme Pawson. The schoolgirl and the father of Forrest said the link raised questions over her impartiality.

The girl is now unlikely to be able to visit, write to or talk to the former maths teacher until his expected release in 2015.

Forrest’s father Jim, a retired IT director, said he felt it was inappropriate for the social worker to be making decisions about the case while in her current relationship.

Mr Forrest, 60, who lives in Orpington, Kent, added: ‘It would seem fair and proper that a completely impartial and fresh view is taken.’

The ruling has left the girl, now 16, ‘devastated and distraught’ – and Forrest is said to be considering a legal challenge.

A source close to the schoolgirl said: ‘She is devastated. She has been in tears and feels it is really unfair as at 16 she is now an adult and feels she should be able to make her own decisions.

‘She is also concerned that her social worker is in a relationship with an investigating officer from the case and thinks it could influence her opinion.’

Forrest, 31, who was married at the time of his affair with the schoolgirl, was jailed for five-and-a-half years after being convicted of abduction at Lewes Crown Court and admitting a further five counts of sexual activity with a child.

The maths teacher at Bishop Bell School, Eastbourne, who had prompted an international police hunt after he and the teenager went on the run in France, was said by the judge in the case to have ‘ignored the cardinal rule of teaching’.

His behaviour had subjected the girl’s family to ‘appalling  distress’ and driven a wedge between the girl and her family, the judge added.

The girl wrote to Forrest’s parents to declare her love for their son and apologise for ‘any upset’.

She has also written to the  governors of Lewes prison, East Sussex, where Forrest began  his sentence, and Ashfield, near Bristol, where he is currently detained, to try to get in touch with him and gain visitor rights. All her requests were rejected, however.

An East Sussex County Council spokesman said: ‘The conditions which have been put in place are not the decision of any one individual but are the result  of a multi-agency approach with involvement at senior management level.

‘Our staff have acted appropriately and have followed strict safeguarding procedures. Our primary concern is, as it has been all along, the safety and well-being of this vulnerable teenager.’

They refused to comment on any  relationships the girl’s social worker may have.

Lucy Duckworth, of child protection campaign group See Changes, felt the ban was entirely justified. She said: ‘It is extremely sensible and long overdue.’

Forrest’s solicitor, Phil Smith, said:  ‘We are exploring all options in relation to this.’
