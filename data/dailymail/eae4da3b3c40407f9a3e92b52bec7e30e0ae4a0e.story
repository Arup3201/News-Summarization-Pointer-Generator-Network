The investigation began in June when a former student, who is now an adult, reported forceful sexual abuse by Barton when he was enrolled in the school, said police Lt. Marc Reno.

Barton, an Oceanside resident, is scheduled to appear in Vista Superior Court on Tuesday. His bail is set at $6 million, reported CBS8.com. 

'Protecting children is the police department's highest priority,' said City of Carlsbad Police Chief Gary Morrison, in a statement to media.

'We are equally outraged by the possibility of such a crime occurring in our community. We take any report of this nature very seriously, and we are using every available resource in our investigation,'Morrison continued.

The police statement did not mention the name of the victims or whether or not the events occurred on or off campus.
