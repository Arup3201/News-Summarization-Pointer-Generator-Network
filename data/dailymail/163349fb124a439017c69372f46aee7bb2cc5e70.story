Ever 'had to go' while swimming in the ocean but felt guilty about polluting the water?

Well, feel guilty no more - according to the American Chemical Society (ACS) peeing in the ocean is not only harmless, it is actually good for marine life.

In a video, it says the components of urine pose no threat to life in the ocean, and if anything they can be beneficial - but they add peeing in enclosed areas like pools is a big no.

We shouldn't feel guilty about going to the loo in the ocean, say experts from the American Chemical Society. With a similar composition to sea water, urine will not dramatically alter it

A lot of people will no doubt have encountered the problem of going for a swim in the sea before realising they need to go to the toilet.

Researchers have warned that urinating in swimming pools could lead to health problems.

Scientists found that compounds in urine mixed with chlorine can cause chemicals that have been linked to respiratory effects in swimmers to form.

They warned swimmers to stop the common practice after analysing samples.

'If swimmers avoided urinating in pools, then air and water quality would likely improve independent of other changes in water treatment or air circulation,' the scientists from China Agricultural University and Purdue University wrote in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. 

But rather than facing the daunting trek back to a bathroom on land, they choose to relieve themselves in the water unbeknown to others.

The ACS says it is ‘absolutely okay’ to go in the ocean in a video on Youtube for the channel Reactions.  

The first reason for this is that urine is mostly water, with the average human’s urine composed of 95 per cent water, while also containing sodium and chloride ions.

By comparison, sea water is about 96.5 per cent water and also contains sodium and chloride, albeit in a higher concentration.

Both also contain potassium, so all in all urine won’t dramatically alter sea water in its vicinity.

The video explains urea in urine can actually be beneficial as it creates ammonium that feeds ocean plant life, so going to the loo when you're down at the seaside (Bournemouth beach during the Air Festival 2013 shown) is fine. But they add that peeing in enclosed areas like swimming pools is not encouraged

Another factor at play is urea, which is the main waste product in urine.

‘As our bodies break down proteins in food urea is the leftover compound that gets rid of the excess nitrogen in our bodies.’

But the amount of urea released, especially in proportion to an entire ocean, is tiny.

For example, the volume of the Atlantic Ocean is 350 quintillion (18 zeroes) litres.

Apparently even if everyone went to the toilet in the ocean, there would still be a miniscule 60 parts per trillion of urea in the water.

In addition, urea contains a lot of nitrogen, which combines with water to produce ammonium.

Ammonium, in turn, feeds ocean plant life - meaning it is actually beneficial.

And finally, the video points out that every animal in the ocean also pees in the water; a whale, for example, can let out 970 litres of urine per day.

‘So if they’re not harming things, you certainly aren’t as well,’ the video says.

They add, however: ‘Don’t pee in protected areas like reefs or smaller bodies of water, especially swimming pools.’
