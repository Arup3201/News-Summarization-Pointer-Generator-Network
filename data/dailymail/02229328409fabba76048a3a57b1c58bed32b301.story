Three teenagers accused of beating and robbing a disabled Army veteran on an Ohio bus while shouting racial slurs have been arrested.

Police apprehended Kenneth Matthews, Ronald Reid Williams and an unnamed 16-year-old girl who allegedly filmed last Friday's daytime attack on her cellphone, as they tried to flee.

The trio were among up to eight teenagers who allegedly mobbed Matthew Robinson on the RTA Healthline in Cleveland.

When the college student got off the bus near 6th Street and Euclid Avenue, the group allegedly followed him before stealing his belongings while yelling, 'Knock that white boy out!' Bystanders in the Public Square refused to help him.

'What they were saying was, ‘Knock that 
boy out!’ ‘White boy.’ ‘Cracker'. They were saying, ‘Knock that white boy out',' a visibly shaken Matthews told 19 Action News.

'The whole time I'm just thinking, pretty much protect myself and don't let anybody in behind you. No-one stepped in to help, so I thought it was a shame.

'No-one should have to deal with that kind of racism or ridicule.

'I think there should be jail time for assaults. Who's to say that your mother or sister couldn't be on the bus, and the same thing could happen to them.'
