Doubts were swirling last night about the future of the head of the civil service, following rumours that David Cameron and Britain’s top mandarin want him out.

Sir Bob Kerslake is taking the flak for the perceived failure of mandarins to modernise and their continued refusal to obey many instructions from ministers.

The civil service chief is understood to have lost the confidence of the Prime Minister and Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary.

This week a progress report on the Government’s civil service reform plan found that only seven of 18 targets had been met since it was unveiled last year.

There are rumours Mr Cameron has asked Sir Jeremy to move Sir Bob aside amid fears he was not pushing the agenda hard enough.

Sir Bob has two jobs – he is head of the civil service but also permanent secretary of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

It has led to concerns that he does not have enough time to devote to both tasks.

Downing Street denied the rumours last night, and said Sir Bob had Mr Cameron’s full support.

But other sources said that, although Sir Bob is safe for now, he could be given the chop as civil service head late on – while keeping his local government department position.

One source said: ‘There is some disappointment about the progress that has been made on civil service reform. 

‘Progress has been slow and some have questioned whether the right leadership is in place.’
