It was the final minute of a one-sided game and Everton winger Christian Atsu set off on one last attack. Sprinting in front of him was Ross Barkley and Atsu wasted no time sending the England man clear.

As Tim Krul raced out, Barkley danced around him, the ball never leaving his feet and - with the goal at his mercy - he gracefully applied the finishing touch. Goodison Park, at long last, was exultant and all around this old stadium, fans punched the air in celebration.

On the touchline, Roberto Martinez was a little more reserved but there is no doubt a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. This was a big day for the manager and his team, but they came through it with panache. In the end they beat Newcastle 3-0 but that score might have been six.

Everton move six points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with what turned out to be a comfortable win for the home side in the end. The Toffees took the lead through James McCarthy before Romelu Lukaku added a second from the penalty spot. Everton's day was made easier when Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for a dangerous lunging tackle on Aaron Lennon before Ross Barkley added a third in the closing stages of the match.

Substitute Ross Barkley shows Kone how it is done by rounding Krul before placing the ball into an empty net. 

Kone rounds Krul after dodging several challenges from Newcastle's defenders but he runs out of space to score. He probably should have squared the ball to a team-mate but his goalscoring instinct saw him try to score a goal of his own.

Atsu comes on for the final five minutes of this afternoon's match at Goodison Park. 

Sissoko, who is captaining Newcastle following Coloccini's sending off, made Howard make his first real save of the afternoon with a powerful shot at goal. Howard made a good save to his left before shouting at his defenders.

Osman, who has been in impressive form, just tested Krul with an effort but the Dutchman was able to palm the ball to safety. 

The Toffees are not exactly pushing for a third goal but I suppose they are content with their two-goal advantage. Newcastle, on the other hand, are starting to tire due to their numerical disadvantage. 

Gutierrez replaces Riviere as 10-man Newcastle attempt to close up shop. They know they are out of the game now so it's just a case of keeping the scoreline down to as low as possible.

Newcastle's day has been made even worse as their captain has been sent off for a disgusting challenge - if you can call it that - on Lennon. He was incredibly late and his studs were raised as he made a lazy attempt to win back possession for his side. 

Carver throws on Cabella for Ameobi immediately after Everton's second.

Lukaku adds a crucial second goal by converting the penalty from 12 yards. He slots the ball past Krul before running away in celebration. 

Gouffran is penalised for a clumsy tackle on Aaron Lennon.

Kone is being given the time and space to dictate play in the middle of the park but his final pass leaves a lot to be desired. 

Ayoze Perez came on at half-time in place of Obertan. A positive move by John Carver, who will feel his side can get something out of today's game.

Just to recap, here's how McCarthy scored his first goal of the season for Everton. That strike could be pivotal in terms of the Toffees' hopes of staying in the Premier League.

A nervous Everton side go into the interval with a 1-0 lead. McCarthy's goal was somewhat fortunate as Krul should have done a lot better but the Toffees will take any kind of fortune given this position in the league.

The home crowd are starting to vent their frustrations at Everton despite still being in the lead. Toffees fans will be desperate for their side to open up a two-goal lead in order to ensure they take all three points.

The Toffees have grown in confidence since taking the lead through McCarthy. Kone appears to be enjoying a free role just behind Lukaku, while the Belgium international is holding the ball up well. 

Baines is starting to have some joy down the left. Janmaat is struggling to deal with Baines' runs from deeps. The England left back could have some joy today.

Nice moment at Goodison Park. Jonas Gutierrez has just started warming up, running alongside the Family Enclosure towards the Gwladys Street end, both of which are the domain of home supporters.

As he made his way to the corner flag on his short shuttle sprint, there was spontaneous applause from Evertonians, a mark of respect for what he has been through.

Everton are starting to get a real grip on this game. Ryan Taylor received a yellow card for bringing down the marauding Lennon. 

Good atmosphere inside Goodison Park, none of the tension that made the first 30 minutes of the Europa League contest with Dynamo Kiev so uncomfortable.

Everton have had the better of the play so far and look fresher, thanks to Roberto Martinez making five changes from that 2-1 win on Thursday. It’s a big game for Everton and they look primed to get the result they need particularly now that James McCarthy has given them the lead.

Lukaku holds the ball up before laying it on to McCarthy who scores his first goal of the season with a driven shot at goal. Krul committed himself to diving to his right, however McCarthy sent the ball in the opposite corner.

Both sides have failed to really trouble the opposing goalkeeper in the first 17 minutes of the match. Newcastle are just shading the possession stats.

Martinez will also need help from his goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has not been in the best of form this season. The former Manchester United man will surely take confidence in his early save.

Everton's last home win in the Premier League came back in December when Martinez's side beat QPR 3-1. The Toffees will surely have to improve their home form if they cant to climb the table and ensure they are not involved in a relegation scrap.

Lukaku, who found the back of the net against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday, stings Krul's gloves with a powerful shot at goal. He will be desperate to live up to his price-tag and help Everton pull away from the relegation zone.

Newcastle have started the match extremely brightly. Obertan tested Howard with a powerful effort before Williamson's shot was cleared off the line. 

Everton: Howard; Baines, Jagielka, Alcaraz, Coleman; McCarthy, Gibson, Lennon, Osman; Kone, Lukaku

Newcastle: Krul; Janmaat, Coloccini, Williamson, R.Taylor; Colback, Sissoko; Obertan, Gouffran, Ameobi; Riviere

The attention switches from the top half of the table to the bottom half where Everton are in desperate need of a win. Roberto Martinez's side are currently just three points away from the Barcalys Premier League drop zone. Newcastle, on the other hand, are sitting comfortably in mid-table. 

Everton will look to pull clear of the relegation zone in the Premier League with three points against mid-table Newcastle at Goodison Park.

Roberto Martinez's side have struggled this season - a surprise given their impressive fifth-placed finish last year - and are currently only three points away from the bottom three.

Newcastle, on the other hand, have been secure in mid-table for the majority of this season. They have dropped away from the clubs towards the top of the league, but still find themselves 10 points away from the relegation zone. Three points against Everton would almost certainly secure their Premier League status for another season.
