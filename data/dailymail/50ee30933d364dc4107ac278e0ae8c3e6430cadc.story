Death sentence: Ronald Clinton Lott, pictured, is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday, December 10, 2013 for brutally killing two elderly women more than a quarter-century ago

An Oklahoma man convicted of raping and murdering two elderly women in the 1980s was executed Tuesday night, after a last meal of fish, fries and hush puppies with tartar sauce and ketchup from Long John Silver's.

Ronald Clinton Lott, 53, made no final statement before he received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.

Lott, the fifth Oklahoma death row inmate to be executed this year, was pronounced dead at 6:06 p.m., officials confirmed.

As the curtains opened, Lott looked over at his brother, who raised his fist and nodded. Lott made no final statement. He again looked at his brother in the first row of the viewing room as the drugs were pumped into his body, then Lott's eyes closed. He started breathing heavily and gasped for air three times.

Following the pronouncement of death, corrections workers tried to close the curtains, but one wouldn't despite repeated attempts.

They ended up hanging a white sheet over the window.

An Oklahoma County jury convicted Lott of two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Anna Laura Fowler, 83, in September 1986 and Zelma Cutler, 93, in January 1987. He was also convicted of raping the women. State and federal courts denied Lott's appeals.

No members of the victims' families were in attendance, but an attorney for Lott was.

Fowler lived alone in Oklahoma City when Lott broke into her home through the back screen door and attacked her on September 2, 1986. Authorities said Fowler was raped and a knotted cloth was used to bind her hands.

She had multiple injuries, including rib fractures and bruising on her wrists, hands, eyes, lips and cheeks. She died from asphyxiation, and her grandson found her dead on her bed the next morning.

Cutler's home was across the street from Fowler and she also lived alone. Police found her dead on her bed on January 11, 1987. The electricity to Cutler's home had been shut off at the breaker box and the phone wire had been cut. She had been raped and had multiple rib fractures and bruising.

In November, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 to deny commuting Lott's death sentence to life in prison.

At the clemency hearing, Lott apologized to the victims' families and asked for their forgiveness.

'I'm so sorry for what I've done. And I'd ask them to forgive me,' Lott told board members, victims' family members and others during a teleconference from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester. 'I caused them so much hurt and pain.'

Lott initially told members of the Pardon and Parole Board that he wanted to waive his clemency hearing, but made a statement after his attorney pleaded with him to do so. He refused to ask the board to spare his life, though, despite his attorney's pleas.

Jim Fowler, the son of Anna Fowler, urged the board to spare Lott's life 'and let him rot in that damn cell.'

Another man, Robert Lee Miller Jr., originally was convicted of the heinous crimes after he confessed to police in 1987. Miller spent 11 years in prison before DNA evidence finally linked Lott to the slayings. Miller was released in 1998 after seven years on death row. Lott has been on death row since 2001.

Stay: Missouri death row inmate Allen Nicklasson, pictured in 2011, has had his execution stayed a little more than a day before he was set to die for killing businessman Richard Drummond in 1994

Murder: Nicklasson, pictured left in 2008, was convicted of killing a man who stopped on a highway to help him and two other men whose car had broken down

In January, the U.S. 10th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Denver rejected Lott's appeal. He claimed he 
received ineffective counsel during the sentencing phase of the trial. 
He also argued there was prosecutorial misconduct and insufficient 
evidence in his case.

The execution in Oklahoma comes after a federal appeals court panel stayed a Missouri execution planned for hours later.

Missouri
appealed the 2-1 ruling by the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals 
panel to stay the execution of Allen Nicklasson, 41, who was found 
guilty of killing a stranger who offered him roadside assistance. 
Nicklasson has raised claims that his trial and appeals counsel were 
ineffective.

Nicklasson's execution was set for 12.01 a.m. Wednesday at a Missouri prison.

In the Missouri case, Nicklasson was found guilty of murder for the August 1994 shooting of motorist Richard Drummond, who stopped on a highway to help Nicklasson and two other men whose car had broken down.

The men had burglarized a home where they stole guns and ammunition before their vehicle broke down. When Drummond stopped to offer a ride, the men abducted him, took him to a wooded area and shot him in the head, according to court records.

One of the men, Dennis Skillicorn, was executed in 2009. The other man, Tim DeGraffenreid, was 17 at the time. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and received a reduced sentence.

Nicklasson and Skillicorn were also convicted of killing an Arizona couple while they were on the run after killing Drummond. Nicklasson would be the second person executed in Missouri this year.
