Police have released this image of the suspected gunman, who is believed to have shot a teenage boy twice in the head after opening fire on a Brooklyn street

A 13-year-old boy was shot through the eye when he was hit by two stray bullets after a gunman opened fire in a street in New York.

Gama Droiville was with his aunt outside a Brooklyn pizzeria when the gunman opened fire yesterday afternoon, police have said.

The teenager was hit twice in the head, with one of the bullets going through his eye.

He was rushed to hospital where he was described as being in a serious but stable condition.

The boy's aunt Laurieuse Droiville, 37, told the New York Daily News she heard the shots before trying to run away from the area with Gama and his cousin.

She said: 'Next thing I know he was on the floor. He was saying he can't see.'

Rufino Salazar, manager of the pizzeria, said the teenager's aunt screamed 'My boy is dying' as  he was brought into the restaurant.

Gama was taken to Kings County Hospital, where doctors said he could lose the wounded eye, his family have said.

A 24-year-old man, who police believe was the intended target, was hit once in the leg and attended the same hospital for treatment, according to the New York Post.

He has also been questioned by detectives, according to the report. 

Police have released security camera 
images of a man, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and believed to be in his 
20s, with a gun in his right hand running down the street.

He can then later be seen going in the opposite direction with his hood over his head.

Detectives have so far made no arrests in connection with the shooting.

The
 shooting follows another firearm-related incident in New York, a couple
 of days earlier, on Saturday, when a uniformed officer shot and killed 
an 86-year-old man after he refused to drop his gun.

A 24-year-old man, who police believe was the intended target, was hit once in the leg after the gunman opened fire. Police have released surveillance footage of the suspected gunman

They say the gunman, later identified as Jack Calvello, may have shot a woman before police arrived at the scene in Astoria, Queens.

Police say a 911 call came in at 11:16am, and the caller said he had shot his daughter.

Officers found a man armed with a gun and the man refused an order to drop his weapon, then pointed his gun at the officers; one of the officers then shot him.

The 86-year-old gunman Calvello, who was also deaf, was pronounced dead at a hospital.
