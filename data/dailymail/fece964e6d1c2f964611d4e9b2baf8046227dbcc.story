Mario Gotze and Franck Ribery goals ensured Bayern Munich kept up their unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season. 

World Cup winning goalscorer Gotze gave Bayern the lead from the edge of the penalty area just before the half hour mark before Ribery sealed the three points in the last five minutes.

But Bayern's victory was marred by a knee injury to defender Holger Badstuber.

Off the mark: Mario Gotze looks to the heavens after scoring for Bayern Munich 

Finish: Gotze fires Bayern into the lead from the edge of the penalty area 

Good job: L-r Gotze is congratulated by Xabi Alonso and Jerome Boateng 

The 25-year-old has twice injured his anterior cruciate ligament in less than two years.  

The Stuttgart clash was only his third appearance since December 2012 and the Bavarians will be hoping lightning hasn't struck for a third time. 

One bit of good news for Pep Guardiola's team was the return from injury of Ribery - the winger came on to replace goalscorer Gotze for the last 20 minutes. 

And it didn't take him long to make an impact on his return to the Allianz Arena, slipping the ball past Stuttgart goalkeeper Sven Ulrich from a tight angle to kill off any hopes they away side had of snatching a point.   

Instant impact: Franck Ribery came off the bench to clinch the points for Bayern 

Injured: Defender Holger Badstuber is down with yet another injury 

Substitution: Badstuber trudges past Pep Guardiola as he is taken off 

On the head: Bayern new boy Alonso beats Christian Gentner in the air 

Champions Bayern started the season with a 1-1 draw at Schalke after beating Wolfsburg 2-1 on the opening weekend of the season. 

And they will now go into Wednesday's big Champions League opener against Man City full of confidence but Stuttgart are still seeking their first win of the season and stay third from bottom on a solitary point.

Embrace: Managers Guardiola and Armin Veh share a joke before the game
