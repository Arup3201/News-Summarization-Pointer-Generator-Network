They emerged as a novel way for the rich and famous to expand their homes, but now 'mega basements' are set to be outlawed in one of Britain's wealthiest areas.

The London borough of Kensington and Chelsea has become the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on controversial subterranean developments.

Basement extensions several storeys below the ground have become increasingly popular in some of the capital's most expensive neighbourhoods as home-owners attempt to increase their living space without infringing strict planning controls.

They have led to the creation of what are known as 'iceberg homes', with the extra space earmarked to accommodate private cinemas, spas and swimming pools.

Jon Hunt, founder of the estate agents Foxtons, and Hans Rausing, heir to the Tetra Pak fortune, were said to be among those to have sought permission for basement extensions in the capital in recent years.

The trend has gathered pace in the last decade.

The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicole Kidman and Roman Abramovich have all extended underground. However, doing so comes at a premium.

Last August, millionaire hedge fund boss Reade Griffith was order to pay £800,000 to create a huge two-storey underground basement below his two adjoining Kensington townhouses.

He received the unprecedented levy from Kensington and Chelsea Council when he was granted planning permission for the extension, which houses a swimming pool, spa and 'treatment area'.

In 2001 there were just 46 planning applications for basement developments in Kensington and Chelsea, rising to 450 last year.

The council said they have also increased in size, with two and three-storey basements 'not uncommon'.

They have drawn repeated complaints from neighbouring residents about noise and dust.

Now after a two-year process, Kensington and Chelsea council has announced that a Government planning inspector has given the green light to its proposals to curb the scale of subterranean development.

Basement extensions will still be permitted but the new rules will restrict how far they can stretch under a garden, limit them to a single storey in most cases and ban developments under listed buildings altogether.

Council cabinet member for planning policy Tim Coleridge said:'Basements have been the single greatest planning concern our residents have expressed to us in living memory.

'Many have experienced years of misery from noise, vibration, dust and construction traffic.

'Two years ago we started drafting a policy to try and strike the right balance between addressing our residents' concerns and the genuine need for people to expand their homes.

'It hasn't been easy and basement developers have aggressively opposed us every step of the way. We are delighted that the inspector agrees that we have got it right while at the same time praising us for our extensive public consultation.

'This ruling is a victory not only for the council but also our residents who have been overwhelmingly supportive of what we have been trying to do.'

The new guidelines are set to be formally adopted at the next full council meeting in January.

Actress Joan Collins expressed the outrage of many earlier this year, hitting out at her new neighbours in upmarket Belgravia - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes.

The Dynasty actress, 80, told a residents' magazine: 'It's really sad. I find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year.'

Queen guitarist Brian May also took umbrage at building work near his Kensington home. Writing online last month he said: 'Kensington used to be a nice quiet decent place to live... now it's becoming a hellhole'.

Well-heeled residents have started to hit back - in June of last year Pamela, Countess Listowel, joined 57 other resident in Camden in lodging an official objection to basement plans on her Victorian street.
