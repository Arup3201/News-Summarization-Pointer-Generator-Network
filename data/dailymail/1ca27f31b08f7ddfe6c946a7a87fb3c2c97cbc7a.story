James Edward Maxwell, 41, has been jailed after admitting 17 counts of fraud - he promised clients meetings with celebrities and luxury holidays

A conman who lured people into handing over tens of thousands of pounds for bogus meetings with famous people has been jailed for fraud.

James Edward Maxwell, 41, from Sittingbourne, Kent, swindled clients out of £750,000 by offering them deals where they could attend high-profile sporting events and meet their heroes.

A gambling addict, he tricked dozens of customers into paying for 'dream encounters' with celebrities, as well as luxury holidays and investment deals, but none of the promises ever came to fruition.

Maxwell, who helped run The Autograph Store and Sports Idols, based in Sittingbourne, and also set up Premier Signings and Hospitality Ltd, was jailed on Friday after admitting 17 counts of fraud.

Maidstone Crown Court heard that when customers complained, Maxwell spun even more lies, claiming his young son had a rare form of bone cancer and saying he himself had testicular cancer.

Detective Constable Steve Payne said Maxwell spun a 'staggering 
web of lies' in an attempt to pay for his gambling habit.

He said: 'He betrayed dozens of people with his fraud when it emerged the deals he was offering were simply too good to be true.'

Maxwell's offers included flights and 
five star hotels, packages for the Monaco and British Grand Prix, and accommodation on a super-yacht 
owned by motorsport tycoon Eddie Jordan.

He
 falsely claimed he could offer bargains at cost price because he had 
‘connections’ with celebrities, telling them: 'It’s not what you know in
 this business, it’s who.'

Customers
 would be told days before that the yacht had been double-booked or the 
deal had been cancelled, only for Maxwell to promise to invest their 
money into another package.

The swindler made up other aliases to protect his own reputation, and manipulated friends and customers into investing into his businesses by
 saying he had ‘cash flow’ troubles.

Court: Maxwell was jailed for three years, four months at Maidstone Crown Court after admitting fraud

He
 then spent the money on his gambling habit or luxury holidays for his family.

Clients grew suspicious after Maxwell made repeated excuses, or got his aliases muddled up, the court was told, but when
 challenged, he would seek his clients' sympathies by telling them his father had just died, or spinning lies about cancer.

Detectives, who were alerted by some of Maxwell's clients, discovered he had a gambling problem and had been spending up to £1,000 of his victims’ money feeding his habit in a single day.

Maxwell was jailed for three years and four months, and was also disqualified from holding any limited company position for ten years.
