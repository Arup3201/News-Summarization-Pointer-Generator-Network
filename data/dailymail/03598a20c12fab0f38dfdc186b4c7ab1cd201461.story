The father of Taliban shooting victim Malala Yousufzai today told how he feared his brave daughter would die - and even contacted a family member to start making funeral preparations.

Speaking at a press conference at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, an emotional Ziauddin Yousufzai said it was 'a miracle' that his daughter was still alive.

He said: 'I think that it is a miracle for us because when I saw my daughter 
after she had been operated on, her whole body was swollen and she was in
 a very bad condition.

'I talked to my brother-in-law that we should make preparations for her funeral. I am thankful to God.'

He said: 'An attacker, who could be called the agent of Satan, he 
attacked, but after that I found angels on my side, everywhere, all 
around me, until this time and this place.'

He said: 'The person who attacked her wanted to kill her. She fell temporarily but she will rise again.

'When she fell Pakistan stood. This is a turning point and that is 
why I am thankful to all the people all over the world, indifferent to
 caste, creed, religion, faith, age, sex.

'Everyone across the world, they condemned the attack in strong words and prayed for my daughter. She is not only my daughter, she is the daughter of everybody. The sister of everybody.

Victim: Malala, 15, was shot by the Taliban on October 9 for speaking out against the militants and promoting education for girls

'In Pakistan for the first time we saw that all political parties, the government, children and women, elders, they were crying and praying to God. 

'Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, indifferent to caste, colour and creed, they prayed for my daughter. I think God kept the honour of people's prayers because those prayers and good wishes from all over the world meant that everything was done in a proper way, a good way. '

The 15-year-old is being treated in the hospital after she was flown to the UK for 
treatment after being shot on October 9.

She was targeted by Taliban gunmen for speaking out against the militants and promoting education for girls.

Support: Malala was flown from Pakistan to be treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham

Prayers: Indian students participate in a prayer ceremony in support of the schoolgirl

Mr Yousufzai, who was accompanied by 
Malala's 12-year-old brother Khushal Khan also thanked hospital staff 
and members of the public for their help and support for his daughter. 

Mr Yousufzai said the family had 
received regular updates from Dr David Rosser, who is treating Malala at
 the hospital, while they were in Pakistan.

He said: 'She got the right treatment, at the right place, at the right time.'

He added: 'She is recovering at an encouraging speed and we are very happy.'

He said her mother, Toorpekai, was too camera-shy to attend today's briefing. He also thanked the Pakistan and UK Government for their help and support.

When asked how he felt when he and his family saw Malala last night, he said: 'I love her and last night when we met her there were tears in our eyes out of happiness.

'We all cried a little bit.'

He said she had also asked her father on the phone to bring her schoolbooks so she could study for her exams.

Malala, was shot in the head and neck at point-blank range as she returned home from school in the Swat Valle

She had been demanding education rights for women in Pakistan and the attack has provoked uproar around the world.

The Taliban have vowed to kill Malala, raising questions about whether it would be safe for her to return

Al-Qaeda are furious that Malala is being hailed a heroine around the world, it was reported earlier this week.

Dr David Rosser, who is treating the teenager, said Malala was continuing to make very good progress clinically.

He said she was walking with very little help, eating well and talking. He said both her short and long term memory seemed to be fine.

'We’re very much in a phase of her care that is about her recovery, both physical and psychological.'She’s very tired but she managed a big smile for her mum and dad and her brothers.'

He said she would have reconstructive surgery on her skull when she was strong enough, which he said could be 'within weeks'.

The reconstruction will involve either reinserting bone or using a titanium plate. When asked about her long term recovery, Dr Rosser said: 'She’s likely to make a full recovery.'

Child rights organisation Plan International today called for more girls to be allowed access to education in Pakistan.

Rashid Javed, director of Plan International in Pakistan, said: 'Malala’s father is right. This can be a pivotal moment for Pakistan. We cannot allow girls here or elsewhere in the world to be denied their fundamental right to education. Malala has bravely stood up and we should all stand up alongside her in this fight.

'There’s an urgent need for girls to have safe, quality schooling in Pakistan. While the importance of education for all - boys and girls - is recognised by the Government, it needs serious political attention, commitment and more financial investment.

'The current barriers keeping girls out of school - child marriage, discrimination, poverty and violence - must be removed if girls are to reach their true potential.'
