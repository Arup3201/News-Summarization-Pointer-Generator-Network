Holy cash-in Batman! A one-off Nissan Juke inspired by the Dark Knight Detective is being given away in a competition run by the Japanese car giant.

Timed to coincide with the DVD release of the movie The Dark Knight Rises, the Juke Nismo has a host of Batman-themed extras.

Looking like something the masked avenger might use to nip down to Sainsbury's on a rare quiet night in Gotham City, the car has matte black paint reminiscent of the 'Tumbler' Batmobile seen in director Christopher Nolan's trilogy.

Downsizing, Batman?: Nissan is giving away a one-off Batman-themed Juke to celebrate the DVD release of The Dark Knight Rises

Vigilante vehicle: As well as a matte black exterior like the film's 'Tumbler' Batmobile, the Juke features bat symbols throughout the exterior and interior

It also has unique ’bat’ detailing, including a 'shark fin' antenna and aluminium bat badges on the front grille and tailgate, kick plates and the suede sports seats.

No word yet on whether it has explosive cannons, the ability to jump across huge gaps using a jet engine, a motorcycle 'Batpod' escape vehicle or bulletproof plating.

However, the Caped Crusader might approve of the the nippy 1.6 litre turbo-charged engine and the puddle lamps mounted in the undersides of the door mirrors that project the superhero’s iconic bat symbol down on to the road.

Prize: The Japanese car manufacturer is giving away the car to one competition winner

The real thing: The 'Batmobile' driven by the superhero  in Batman Begins. The car cost several million dollars to design and build

The special Juke Nismo was designed by 
Nissan Design Europe in London’s Paddington to celebrate the company’s 
relationship with film studio Warner Bros.

Nissan's Juke was released two years ago and has won praise from both motoring journalists and drivers. The 2013 model is available from March, with orders being taken from January.

The Dark Knight Rises had a box office of more than £1billion and featured British actors Christian Bale as the superhero and his alter-ego Bruce Wayne and Tom Hardy as the villainous Bane.
