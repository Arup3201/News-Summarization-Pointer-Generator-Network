A young woman has documented the moment an annoying pothole in her street grew so large within an hour that she could climb into it.

Taking local road maintenance into her own hands, trainee paramedic Krystal Chapman live-tweeted hilarious pictures of her body sinking into the tarmac hole outside her home in North Curl Curl, in Sydney’s northern beaches.

Dressed in a coral top, blue trousers and sunglasses, Ms Chapman at first tentatively just stuck her ankles into the pothole.

‘Sink hole in north curl curl, pitt road!,’ she tweeted to her local newspaper the Manly Daily and her local council in Warringah.

The collapsed part of the road was marked by three orange cones but Ms Chapman demanded immediate action from authorities.

In her next photo on Twitter, Ms Chapman’s leg is submerged in the hole right up to her knee.

‘It's getting worse by the minute!,’ she joked.

'It's getting worse by the minute!,' she joked as her legs were submerged right up to her waist 

Her whole legs, up to her waist, are stuck in the final shocking photo as she uses her hands to stop herself from falling further into the crevice.

‘I don't think council understand the extent of the rapidly worsening problem here!,’ she wrote on Twitter.

When Warringah Council responded to her tweets asking where the pothole was, she told them: ‘@warringah was on pitt road in curl curl! Filled in overnight!’

‘A water pipe broke under the road just outside the house,’ she explained while speaking to Manly Daily.
