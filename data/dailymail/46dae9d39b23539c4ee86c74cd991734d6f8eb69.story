Juventus scored twice in a minute as they came from behind to clinch a dramatic 3-2 Group A win over Olympiacos after Andrea Pirlo had celebrated his 100th Champions League appearance by scoring from a trademark free-kick.

Juve were in real trouble when Delvin N'Dinga gave the Greek champions a 2-1 lead in the 61st minute.

But the Serie A champions levelled when Fernando Llorente's header hit the post and went in off Roberto's foot in the 65th minute. Paul Pogba struck the winner one minute later.

Arturo Vidal missed a chance for a fourth when his stoppage time penalty was saved by Roberto.

Pirlo curled in a free kick to put Juve ahead in the 21st minute and Alberto Botia headed Olympiacos level three minutes later. The result left both teams with six points from four games in Group A.

Juventus should have been ahead at halftime but missed a flurry of chances before the break.

Alvaro Morata was sent clear but rolled the ball wide of Roberto's goal and Pogba then side-footed wide from the edge of the area after the ball deflected into his path.

Olympiacos, 1-0 winners two weeks ago, stunned the Juventus stadium when the home defence only partially cleared a free kick, Giannis Maniatis swung the ball back in from the right and Congo midfielder N'Dinga headed into the top corner.

Olympiacos were ahead for only four minutes before Juve's equaliser which was credited as an own goal by Roberto, the Olympiacos hero in the previous match.

One minute later, Llorente's cross found Pogba and although Botia nearly managed to dispossess him, the ball fell to the Frenchman who slotted home from the edge of the box.
