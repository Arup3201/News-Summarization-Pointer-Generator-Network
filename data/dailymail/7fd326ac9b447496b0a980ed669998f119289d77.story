Her husband Michael Douglas was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2010, and the couple have a nine-year-old daughter called Carys.

So Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones' visit to a Cardiff children's hospital where she met a nine-year-old cancer patient was one with a very personal relevance.

The Hollywood star took a short break 
from filming Red 2 with Bruce Willis and Sir Anthony Hopkins in London 
to spend a day at the Children's Hospital For Wales in Cardiff, to 
officially unveil its new name: The Noah's Ark Children's Hospital For 
Wales.

The mum-of-two - who won a best 
supporting actress Oscar in 2003 for her role in Chicago - met with 
little Phoebe Taylor, nine, and other patients at the hospital.

She and her husband have 
played an integral role in helping to raise the £64 needed to build the centre.

Wearing
a tight-fitting black skirt suit with a poppy on her lapel, the 
43-year-old A-lister chatted with Phoebe and Phoebe's mother, Zoe.

Mrs Taylor said: 'It was a lovely 
surprise. We had no idea this was happening today. We thought she'd be 
in bed waiting for an operation - not meeting a Hollywood actress!'

The
Swansea-born actress is a patron of The Noah's Ark Appeal, set up to 
raise funds for the building, and she officially opened the hospital in 
2006.

'The appeal has already donated £12m to the hospital and is on 
course to raise an additional £8m by 2015.

The Ocean's Twelve actress and her husband, actor Michael Douglas, donated a five-figure sum to The Noah’s Ark Appeal in 2005.

The hospital treats around 25,000 young people and 75,000 outpatients 
each year. It provides life-saving treatment to critically ill 
youngsters as well as expert skills for those with conditions requiring 
specialist care.

Bosses hope having the Noah's Ark name in its title will boost donations
further, with its latest target being £8 million for an intensive care 
unit for ill youngsters as well as a hydrotherapy pool.

Asked
about the challenge to raise the capital, Zeta-Jones said: 'I truly 
believe that the human nature of giving is unrelenting - even in dark 
financial times people are still donating money to this wonderful 
hospital.'

She continued: 'The bravery of children and their 
parents who come here really hits home. Coming here today, you cannot 
help but be moved by some of the stories and battles children are going 
through.

'I often talk about it to friends of mine back in the States - it's something I'm very passionate about. It's
great to see the new construction work going on. I feel like I've been 
here since it’s conception. I really feel like family here.'

Scores of parents at the hospital 
today said they were stunned when they discovered they would be coming 
face to face with Hollywood royalty.

Zeta-Jones was visiting.

'I've
been a fan of hers since The Darling Buds Of May,' said Mrs Davies. 'I 
don't at first think Demi knew who she was, but when she realised she 
was meeting a movie star she was over the moon.

'Catherine
Zeta-Jones's visit means a lot because to everyone here because she is 
doing so much to help raise the profile of the hospital.'

That sentiment was 
shared by 38-year-old Caerphilly mother Claire Curtis, whose 
three-year-old daughter Maisie has a rare genetic condition called 
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type two.

Sufferers are born with a severely underdeveloped cerebellum - the part of the brain that co-ordinates movement.

Miss
Curtis said: 'Maisie is the only child in Wales with this condition and
I don't know what we'd do without the help we get from the hospital.

'It's
not just about the excellent treatment she gets, but also the support 
we've had as a family. You can feel so powerless as a parent when your 
child is so seriously ill.'
