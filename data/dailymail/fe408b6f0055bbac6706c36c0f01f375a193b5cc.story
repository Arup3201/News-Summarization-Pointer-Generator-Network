Jimmy Anderson admitted he never thought he would be able to score a Test half-century.

But he reached 50 for the first time in 131 Tests, setting a new world record for a last-wicket stand with Joe Root, and said: ‘I never thought I would be capable of getting a score like that, but I did think last night that if I was to ever get a 50 it would be on a wicket like this because there are only so many types of pitches I could get one on.’

His 81 in a remarkable partnership of 198 with century-maker Root helped rescue England.

Heroic: James Anderson set a world record on Saturday as he and Joe Root formed a final wicket partnership of 198 to rescue England on the fourth day of the first Test with India at Trent Bridge in Nottingham

‘There were only certain balls that could get me out and I didn’t think the short ball would be dangerous because it was so slow and you could stand up and play it,’ he added. ‘We just had a gameplan and stuck to it.’

Anderson, who fell 19 runs short of becoming the first No11 to score a Test hundred, had never reached 50 in any form of cricket but said wryly that he would reserve judgment on whether his unbeaten 49 for Burnley against Todmorden 13 years ago was still his most significant innings.

‘That was a match-winning 49 not out so we’ll wait and see tomorrow if this trumps it,’ said Anderson. ‘Of course, to build a partnership like that with Joe is a brilliant feeling and we enjoyed every minute of it.

‘We knew this morning we had a job to do and we just wanted to eat into as much time as possible while chipping away at their lead and see where we ended up. We didn’t expect to get as far as we did but we’re delighted.

'I thought we had a really good plan and when we came together on Friday he was taking most of the strike. Today we did the same thing and once I’d got myself in we started rotating it more regularly and then obviously got in front. I thought we did it really well.

Game changer: Joe Root's unbeaten 154 turned the match in England's favour though they were unable to turn the screw further with the ball later on

'There were a couple of mix-ups where I set off for a run and got sent back, but I thought on the whole we did it well.

‘Joe is a young lad but he did that with great experience. He talked me through every ball of my innings and I talked him through most of his as well. I’m disappointed not to get a hundred.

'I probably should have left that one that got me out but I gave it the kitchen sink and got an edge. Joe got all the luck today because he played and missed four or five times. I would imagine that’s as good as it will get for me. You never know but I don’t think I’ll ever surpass that.’

Anderson, who scored his 81 off 130 balls, had suffered heartache at Headingley where he faced 55 balls without scoring in England’s excruciating loss to Sri Lanka and he admitted he wasn’t sure how to celebrate his landmark.

‘Joe came down the wicket and said milk it,’ said Anderson. ‘I didn’t know what that meant so I just did the round with the bat. I’ve seen people point at the dressing room so I did that, too.

‘I’ve had to do certain jobs for the team. It was disappointing at Headingley but it makes you cherish moments like these even more.’
