President Barack Obama on Wednesday scrapped part of long-planned trip to Asia and left the remainder of the trip in doubt as a U.S. government shutdown entered a second day with no end in sight to the funding battle in Congress that triggered it.

Obama scuttled two stops on a planned four-country tour and left visits to two other countries up in the air, according to White House statements.

The president told his counterparts in Malaysia and the Philippines he would not be able to meet them as planned and a White House official said the president is weighing whether to attend diplomatic summits in Indonesia and Brunei.

No reassurances: Barack Obama warned world bankers that they should not take for granted that lawmakers will agree to raise the debt ceiling in time to avoid a default

'We will continue to evaluate those 
trips based on how events develop throughout the course of the week,' 
National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

Obama was originally due to leave the United States on Saturday and return a week later.

Not
 only must the president deal with the budget impasse and its effects, 
but he faces an even bigger crunch in Congress, which will put the 
United States at risk of defaulting on its debts if it does not raise 
the U.S. public debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said the 
United States will exhaust its borrowing authority no later than October
 17.

The fight between 
Obama's Democrats and the Republicans over the government's borrowing 
power is rapidly merging with the standoff over every day funding, which
 has forced the first government shutdown in 17 years and forced 
hundreds of thousands of federal employees to take unpaid leave.

The
 White House announcements about the Asia trip followed a fruitless day 
on Capitol Hill, with congressional Democrats and Republicans coming no 
closer to resolving their differences.

Obama
 accused Republicans of taking the government hostage to sabotage his 
signature healthcare law, the most ambitious U.S. social program in five
 decades, passed three years ago.

Republicans
 in the House of Representatives view the Affordable Care Act as a 
dangerous extension of government power, and have coupled their efforts 
to undermine it with continued efforts to block government funding. The 
Democratic-controlled Senate has repeatedly rejected those efforts.

The
 standoff has raised new concerns about Congress's ability to perform 
its most basic duties and threatens to hamper a still fragile economic 
recovery.

'This is a mess. A royal screw-up,' said Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter of New York.

As
 police cordoned off landmarks such as the Lincoln Memorial, and 
government agencies stopped functions ranging from cancer treatments to 
trade negotiations, Republicans in the House sought to restore funding 
to national parks, veterans' care and the District of Columbia, the 
capital.

An effort to pass
 the three bills fell short on Tuesday evening, but Republicans plan to 
try again on Wednesday. They are likely to be defeated by the 
Democratic-controlled Senate.

'That's
 important - a park? How about the kids who need daycare?' said 
Democratic Representative Sander Levin of Michigan. 'You have to let all
 the hostages go. Every single one of them.'

The
 setback to the Asia trip, designed to reinforce U.S. commitment to the 
region, is the first obvious international consequence of the troubles 
in Washington.

'They've
 shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable
 health insurance to millions of Americans,' Obama said on Tuesday.

Republicans
 said Obama could not complain about the impact of the shutdown while 
refusing to negotiate. 'The White House position is unsustainably 
hypocritical,' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John 
Boehner.

A Reuters/Ipsos 
poll indicated that 24 percent of Americans blamed Republicans, while 19
 percent blamed Obama or Democrats. Another 46 percent said everyone was
 to blame.
