In what is possibly his last interview before his execution on Wednesday in Missouri, serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin has admitted to killing 22 people - 17 more murders than he has been convicted of.

The self-confessed neo-Nazi, who had a pathological hatred of blacks, Jews and interracial couples is scheduled to die by lethal injection at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre.

Confirming that he was responsible for the cold-blooded execution-style deaths of 'approximately' 22 people, Franklin showed sparse remorse as he attempted to justify his killings - which famously included an attempt on the life of Hustler porn supremo Larry Flynt - who incredibly has tried to stop his shooters execution.

Murderer: Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday and showed no remorse in what could be his last interview

Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday for the sniper killing of 42-year-old Gerald Gordon outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue in 1977.

Following his arrest in 1980, Franklin told detectives that he selected the St Louis synagogue from the Yellow Pages of the telephone directory because he wanted to 'find a Jew and kill him'

Franklin was also convicted of killing an interracial couple in Madison, Wisconsin in 1977, two black joggers in Salt Lake City in 1980, a two teenage black boys and bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977.

'I felt like I was at war. The survival of the white race was at stake,' said Franklin to Kyung Lah of CNN.

'I consider it my mission, my three-year mission. Same length of time Jesus was on his mission, from the time he was 30 to 33.'

Investigators believe Franklin, fueled by a hatred of blacks and Jews, committed many more crimes in several states. He has reportedly confessed to at least 22 killings, 16 bank robberies and other crimes during the late 1970s until he was caught after the Salt Lake City killings in 1980.

Among his alleged crimes were two high-profile shootings — of civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1980, and the man he calls his 'old pal' - porn baron Larry Flynt in Lawrenceville, Georgia, in 1978. Both men survived.

Franklin believed that he was going to start a race war and his preferred method to kill his victims was to stalk them and set up a sniper's nest from which he would shoot his victim's from distance.

Born James Clayton Vaughn in Mobile, Alabama, Franklin attempted to blame his upbringing for his murderous cruelty.

'My momma didn't care about us,' he said as he complained he wasn't fed properly and not allowed to play with other children.

Finding another family in the white supremacist groups in the American South in the 1960s, Franklin was moved to action after he read Adolf Hitler's political manifesto, 'Mein Kampf'.

'I've never felt that way about any other book that I read. It was something weird about that book.'

At 26, he changed his name to Joseph Paul Franklin. Joseph Paul to honor  Paul Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, and Franklin after Benjamin Franklin.

He even attempted to link himself to infamous serial killer Charles Manson by having the words 'Helter Skelter' tattooed on his arm in reference to Manson's inspiration provided by The Beatles 'White Album'.

However, the tattoo artist refused.

As he began his killings, Franklin said he hoped his murders would prove to act as an example.

'I figured once I started doing it and showed them how, other white supremacists would do the same thing.'

In one incredulous claim, Franklin said that the communities he targeted now have members who love him.

'When you commit a crime against a certain group of people, a bonding takes place. It seems like you belong to them,' he said.

In addition to the murder of Gordon outside a a bar mitzvah, Franklin was convicted of killing Alphonse Manning and Toni Schwean in Madison, Wisconsin, because they were an interracial couple.

He also confessed to shooting dead college student Rebecca Bergstrom, all because she told him in passing that she dated a Jamaican man.

His most shocking murder was that of 13-year-old Dante Evans and his cousin 14-year-old Darrell Lane in Cincinnati -  two African Americans jogging with white female friends.

Joseph Deters, who prosecuted that Cincinnati case said, 'He's just a creep. There's no other way to describe him. And what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible.'

Victim: Larry Flynt says he doesn't to see the man who shot him put to death

Hustler chief Flynt was standing trial on an obscenity charge in Georgia in 1978 when he was wounded by a sniper's bullet. No one was arrested at the time.

Franklin was housed in federal prison in Marion, Ill., in the mid-1990s when he confessed to shooting Flynt. Gwinnett County, Ga., District Attorney Danny Porter said he is convinced Franklin shot Flynt because Franklin provided information only the shooter would know — details about the shooting location, the type of weapon used, even the maker of the gun.

Franklin said he shot the pornographer because of a magazine front cover showing an interracial couple.

'I saw that interracial couple he had, photographed there, having sex,' said Franklin to CNN, referring to the December 1975 issue of Hustler

'It just made me sick. I think whites marry with whites, blacks with blacks, Indians with Indians. Orientals with orientals. I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.'

However, Porter said opted against filing charges because Franklin had already been convicted of multiple killings and said it didn't make sense to bring him back to Georgia to face trial for shooting Flynt.

Incredibly, Flynt has become an unlikely supporter of Franklin's - in so much as he doesn't want him to face the death penalty.

He would rather he spent the rest of his life behind bars.

'The government has no business at all being in the business of killing people,' said Flynt.

'(It's) much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection.'

As for Franklin, he claims he has cured himself of mental illness through education and is hoping not to be executed.

'Well I'm hoping to get a stay. It might not happen, but if it does, I'm willing to accept the will of the Lord.'
