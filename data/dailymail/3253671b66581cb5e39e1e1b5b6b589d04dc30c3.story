A 26-year-old woman shopping with her newborn baby at a Walmart in Columbus, Indiana was accidentally shot Saturday evening when a man dropped his handgun.

The .22-calibur pistol belonging to Tony E Ward, 56, fell out of his holster inside the Walmart at 2025 Merchants Mile and fired - just missing Virginia Thompson's newborn baby in the shopping cart.

The bullet instead hit a bottle of soda and ricocheted, hitting Ms Thompson in the upper arm.

Local Police Chief Jon Rohde just happened to be in the store at the time of the shooting and called paramedics.

Ms Thompson was treated on the scene, but asked not to be taken to the hospital.

Mr Ward had a permit for the weapon, and police officials say he will not be charged in the incident.

This is the second accidental shooting in a Walmart this month. On May 17, a man accidentally shot himself in the leg at a Phoenix, Arizona location.Â
