Firebrand U.S. talkshow host Glenn Beck has accused the Associated Press news agency of 'raping' Bill Crosby after it published an interview in which it asks him about claims he sexually assaulted more than a dozen women.

The AP published the interview on Wednesday in which the comedian refuses to comment on the allegations. But he is later recorded asking the reporter to 'scuttle' that part of the interview.

And today, Conservative loudmouth and former Fox News host Beck, 49, defended the comedian in a 15-minute rant on his eponymous radio show, declaring, 'You want to talk about rape? That's media rape right there.'

Referring to the AP's question, he went on: 'You said you would not [ask] that. Since when does your 'no' mean 'yes'? Do you know the definition of 'no,' sir? You've just raped Bill Cosby. You said you wouldn't do it. You just did it and then you blamed it on him. My gosh, maybe we should have a lesson on rape.'

At the end of the interview, on November 6, Cosby tells the interviewer: 'We thought, because it was AP, that it wouldn't be necessary to go over that question with you.

'Tell your boss the reason why we didn't say that upfront was because we thought ... the AP had the integrity to not ask.'

First response: On Wednesday, the AP published an interview in which a reporter asked Cosby to respond to allegations that he's raped more than a dozen women

'Scuttled': Appearing alongside wife Camille, the comedian refused to comment on the allegations, but is later recorded asking the reporter to 'scuttle' that part of the interview

But the AP concluded by saying: 'The interview was on record. The AP made no agreement to avoid questions about the allegations or to withhold publishing any of his comments at any time.'

The interview took place on November 6 following a string of allegations by women claiming he had drugged and raped them.

Five women have come forward in the past month and claimed that they were drugged and raped by Cosby, four of them when they were teenagers.

One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her.

The other four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them.

Talking about rape: Conservative loudmouth and former Fox News host Beck, 49, defended the comedian in a 15-minute rant on his eponymous radio show, declaring, 'You want to talk about rape? That's media rape right there.'

Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredibly Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her at a part at his house in 1967.

What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room.

When asked to speak about these claims in an AP interview, Cosby said he had 'no response' and 'no comment.'

These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star.

Cosby has also had scheduled appearances on talk shows including The Queen Latifah Show and Late Night With David Letterman cancelled in the wake of these allegations.

TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network.
