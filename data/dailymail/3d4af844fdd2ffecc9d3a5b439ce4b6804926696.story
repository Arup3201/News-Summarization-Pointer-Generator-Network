An empty bag of potato chips and the suspect's poor credit rating helped law enforcement rescue a nurse three days after she had been kidnapped.

Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, 22, was abducted from a street in Philadelphia on Sunday night and found 120 miles away in Jessup, Maryland, on Wednesday.

She was discovered alongside her suspected kidnapper Delvin Barnes who has been taken into custody and is facing multiple federal charges. 

Police have said she managed to stay alive because of her resistance and 'fighting spirit', but small pieces of evidence and tips from the public also led law enforcement to her location.

A citizen found a receipt from an Acme, a broken key chain, smashed glass, a zip tie and an empty Herr's potato chip bag, and called police after hearing news reports of the abduction.

Rescued: Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, 22, (left) was abducted from a street in Philadelphia on Sunday night and found 120 miles away in Jessup, Maryland, on Wednesday with her suspected kidnapper Delvin Barnes 

Violent: She was abducted in what police say was a random attack. Authorities were able to track her down following tips from the public - including the discovery of an empty bag of potato chips and a receipt 

Joy: The nurses mother Keisha Gather smiles, surrounded by family and friends, after a police press conference that revealed her daughter had been rescued 

The receipt led officers to the Acme store Barnes had visited after allegedly kidnapping Freeland-Gather where they were able to obtain clearer CCTV images of the suspect.

According to News One, after the nurse was captured, Barnes is said to have bought a bag of chips using her ATM card. He was also caught on camera taking money out using the same card.

As the information authorities had on Barnes continued to grow, they were able to use the GPS tracker on his Ford Taurus to pick up his location. It was installed because he had such a poor credit history, according to NBC Philadelphia.  

Ed Hanko, the special agent in charge of the Philadelphia FBI field office, said the tips allowed authorities to 'identify this individual, identify his car and track it into Maryland'. 

Freeland-Gaither is now resting at home in Philadelphia after law enforcement agents rescued her Wednesday outside Baltimore and arrested suspect Delvin Barnes.

He says detectives are giving her time to settle down before completing interviews. 

Assistance; A GPS tracker that had been installed in Barnes' car because of his poor credit rating also helped lead law enforcement to the abducted nurse 

Visit: Friends and family of Carlesha Freeland-Gaither are escorted by police into Howard County General Hospital to meet her. Police say she sustained some minor injuries during the abduction 

Police say Freeland-Gaither, who disappeared Sunday night, had some injuries but was generally doing OK.

Barnes is being held on an unrelated Virginia warrant alleging attempted murder, assault and malicious injury with acid, explosives or fire. 

Carlesha's mother, Keisha Gaither, thanked the Philadelphia police, the FBI, the public, and her family and friends for helping find her daughter.

'Thank you so much for having us in your prayers. Thank you for keeping me up. Thanking for being there for us. I'm taking my baby home. Thank you. Thank you so much.' Gaither said.

The mother added that she got a chance to speak to Carlesha over the phone, saying that she was very upset, crying and asking for her.

Authorities were able to get a clearer CCTV image of Barnes after a member of the public called in, saying they had found a recepit from a store he had visited after allegedly kidnapping Freeland-Gaither

Commissioner Ramsey and Keisha Gaither made sure to single out Detective James Sloan for his role in Freeland-Gaither's rescue.

'He said in my kitchen in front of me, "I'm bringing your daughter home," and he brought my daughter home,' Ms Gaither said and embraced the detective. 

Delvin Barnes has a lengthy criminal record, which includes a laundry-list of charges ranging from indecent exposure and false imprisonment to rape, burglary and terrorist threats.

The 37-year-old is now expected to face federal charges in connection to the kidnapping. 

Relieved: Police officials surround Keisha Gaither, who thanked Philadelphia police for bringing her 22-year-old daughter home
