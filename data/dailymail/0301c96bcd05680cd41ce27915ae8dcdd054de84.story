A girl of eight has been excluded from a primary school after attacking another girl with a knife.

The year three youngster poked nine-year-old Molly Heffernan with the blunt blade during lunch break at Archbishop Courtenay Primary School, Maidstone, Kent.

Molly told her mother, Krystle Arnold, 28, she managed to stop the girl on her first attempt but the rounded end caught her spine when she tried for a second time.

Miss Arnold said she kept her daughter away from the school for five days after the incident because she was too scared to return and had suffered from nightmares.

The youngster, believed to be eight-years-old, was told not to return for four days.

Miss Arnold, from Maidstone, said: 'I have no idea why Molly was attacked. She said hadn’t had any problems with the girl.

'The school said there wasn’t any marks or blood on Molly and that it wasn’t serious, but the fact another child tried to stab my daughter is very serious to me.

 'Threatening, abusive or bullying behaviour will not be tolerated at this school and we responded immediately, excluding the pupil in question for the rest of the week'

Headteacher Justine Brown

'Regardless of whether the knife was blunt or not, it shouldn’t have happened and I don’t think the punishment was harsh enough.'

Headteacher Justine Brown said immediate action was taken after the pupil behaved in a 'threatening' way and staff spoke to both girls’ parents.

She said: 'An incident took place at school last week in which one pupil behaved in a threatening way towards another during the lunchtime break.

'Threatening, abusive or bullying behaviour will not be tolerated at this school and we responded immediately, excluding the pupil in question for the rest of the week.

'High standards of behaviour are expected at all times and we will be taking this opportunity to reinforce the expectations we have of pupils’ behaviour.'
