Just a month after Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by Oscar Pistorius her parents are being forced to leave their rented house.

Their home in the southern coastal city of Port Elizabeth has been their bolthole since news of their daughter's Valentine's Day killing emerged.

They now face finding a new home to reside in before they have even scattered their daughter's ashes.

Just a month after Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by Oscar Pistorius her parents June and Barry Steenkamp are being forced to leave their rented house

'They have been given notice on their 
home by the owners,' Reeva's uncle Michael Steenkamp told AFP.

'They are
going to be vacating that house soon.'

Michael Steenkamp said the reason for their eviction was unclear, but said the owner may want to sell the suburban home.

Reeva Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and law graduate, was known to help her parents out with money before her death.

'Reeva did help her parents financially, that is true,' said Michael.

The Daily Star reported that Barry Steenkamp, 69, quit his job after falling ill, relying on earnings from the blonde model's career to help them out.

Reeva's mother, June, 66, said that the day
before she died her daughter had paid for their cable TV to be 
reconnected so they could watch her new reality show, according to the 
newspaper.

There was later confusion about the 
Steenkamp's housing arrangements as later advocate PJ De Bruyn said the 
couple had not been evicted from their house.

He added that owner of the
house wants the Steenkamps to move back, IOL News reports.

The Daily Mirror reported that yesterday Reeva's father, revealed he wanted to meet Pistorius to understand how his daughter died.

He said he does not know what he will say to Pistorius , 26, but said: 'I just feel it’s necessary. For closure.'

Miss Steenkamp's father Barry wept as he said he and his wife June were at 'a complete loss'

He said that the Steenkamps were given two months notice by their landlady as provided for in their written contract.

Michael Steenkamp also confirmed that
the family were planning to scatter Reeva's ashes at Bloubergstrand, a 
beach outside Cape Town, according to the Australian.

'That is what Reeva's wishes were,' he said, adding that her grandfather's ashes were also scattered there.

Pistorius says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot her through a locked bathroom door.

Lawyers have confirmed the family is considering a civil claim against the Paralympic sprint star.

Meanwhile Pistorius is selling up property and shares in his race horses in a bid to pay his spiralling legal costs.

A close friend of the athlete said he
is selling off 'all his property and everything' as he tries to raise 
money to fight the charges of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 
29.

He has already 
racked up a £200,000 legal bill and his selling shares in one of his 
race horses, Tiger Canyon, and trying to sell other property.

His
friend Mike Azzi, who Pistorius calls Uncle Mike, was quoted in the 
Sunday People as saying: 'We spoke about one or two of the horses. He's 
asked me to try to get people to buy them for him because he has no form
of income any longer.

Final goodbye: Michael Steenkamp also confirmed that the family were planning to scatter Reeva's ashes at Bloubergstrand, a beach outside Cape Town

'He's selling off all his property and everything because of the legal costs.'

A new BBC documentary Oscar Pistorius: What Really Happened has also made a number of other claims.

One of the revelations made in the programme is that when the 26-year-old athlete was arrested he told police: 'I'll survive. I always win', reports the Sunday People.

He was replying to a senior officer who told him: 'You could go to jail for a very long time, Oscar.'

Pistorius was released on strict bail conditions two weeks ago. He was ordered to pay a bond of £73,000 and forbidden from returning to his house, the scene of the crime.

His legal costs are mounting and once the trial begins they will soar further.

Lawyers have confirmed the family is considering a civil claim against the Paralympic sprint star after the shooting at his upscale Pretoria mansion on February 14

Pistorius' lucrative sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike and Oakley have been suspended, ending one of his income streams.

Police have confirmed that a witness who lives 150 metres from Pistorius' home in the Silver Woods estate in Pretoria has come forward.

They claim to have heard screams and shots on the night Steenkamp died.

Police have now revealed that the door opens inwards and are investigating the possibility she was using her body to stop the athlete from coming in when she died.

They are also working their way through the 'massive' number of texts on Steenkamp's mobile phone and are continuing to examine the 9mm pistol used and Pistorius' phone.

Investigators have also confirmed that two dogs were at the property at the time.
