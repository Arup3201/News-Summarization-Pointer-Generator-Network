'A wonderful vicar': John Suddards, who was found dead in his home

A 43-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of the Reverend John Suddards.

The vicar was found with multiple stab wounds at a vicarage in Thornbury, Gloucestershire on Monday.

The body of the 59-year-old was discovered by builders who were carrying out work at his vicarage the day after he had held his regular Sunday service.

The Cambridge-educated vicar, who lived alone, was a former lawyer who had taken on his parish less than a year ago. Friends said he had settled well into the community.

Police and paramedics were called to the old stone vicarage at 10.20am on Monday and Mr Suddards was declared dead at the scene.

Avon and Somerset Police launched an investigation into the death – which they described as ‘suspicious’ – and a cordon was set up as officers searched for clues.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Crisp, who is leading the investigation, said: 'I am in a position to confirm now that body found yesterday in the vicarage was Reverend John Suddards.

'He suffered multiple stab wounds, and therefore this is now a murder investigation.

'A 43-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.'

Officers confirmed that the builders, on a planned job, had obtained a key from a caretaker before they walked into the vicarage and made the grim discovery.

Mr Suddards, a clergyman for 22 years, is understood to have never married, and had only started working in the town in July last year after transferring from a parish in Witham, Essex.

He took over the running of St Mary’s Church in Thornbury, as well as St Arilda in Oldbury and Shepperdine Chapel, also in south Gloucestershire.

Shirley Holloway, 69, of South Gloucestershire Council, said Mr Suddards was a ‘wonderful’ vicar.

‘It just doesn’t seem possible. He led our service on Sunday, I shook hands with him in the church,’ she said. ‘He was a very personable man. You would absolutely not expect this sort of thing to happen here.

‘He is such a well-known figure and to hear that it might be a suspicious death is just so hard to comprehend. He has made the most tremendous impression on the town.

‘He has fitted in exceptionally well in the parish and taken part in so much during his short time here. People here are so horrified.’

At the time of his appointment last year, Mr Suddards revealed that a serious car crash led to his dramatic career change.

He said: ‘I was a barrister in London
and I had a major road accident when I was 31. As a result of that 
accident, and a series of events that happened, it led me to believe 
that I should go into the church.

‘Lawyers
can do two things, they can separate people and they can transfer 
money, but not much more than that, and I felt I would like to do much 
more than that.’

Councillor Neil Halsall, 67, deputy mayor of Thornbury, said the suspected murder was ‘most out of keeping’ with the quiet market town.

Forensic teams were called in after Mr Suddards was found soon after 10am on Monday

He said: ‘It is a wonderful place to live. I think if you try to find a murder in the history of Thornbury you would have to go 200 years back.’

Mr Suddards had served at St Nicolas 
Church in Witham, Essex, since 2001. Before that he served Great Yeldham
parish, 20 miles away, having been ordained in 1989.

Rev Simon Garwood, vicar at St Nicolas, said: 'He had served in the area for 10 years and was much loved.

'He was absolutely devoted to the church and worked extremely hard. He gave a lot of himself for the church.

'Many people in the parish are in shock and are trying to digest the news.'

John Goodman, Mayor of Witham, said he and his wife had attended the church on special occasions like Christmas.

Mr Goodman said: 'He was a very quiet
man who kept himself to himself, but he was devoted to the church and 
was a very well-liked rector.

'I’m extremely sad and shocked to hear of his death. The news is gradually trickling through the community and I’m sure many people will feel the same.'

When
he took up the post at St Nicolas’, Mr Suddards, originally from 
Yorkshire, spoke of how he joined the priesthood after an accident.

He told the Braintree and Witham Times: 'I used to be a barrister and I had a fairly major road accident and was paraplegic for nine months.

'I was thinking after that and felt strongly that God wanted me to become a priest.'

Mr Suddards presided over the marriage of the daughter of Braintree councillor Phil Barlow a week before he left for his new parish.

Mr Barlow told the Colchester Gazette: 'I am very saddened. He will be missed by my whole family and everyone who knew him. It is a tragedy.'

The Bishop of Gloucester, the Rt Rev Michael Perham, and the Bishop of Tewkesbury, the Rt Rev John Went, issued a joint statement today.

'We were shocked and saddened to hear the news that a man's body has been found in Thornbury Vicarage,' they said.

'The Diocese of Gloucester will do everything it can to assist the police in their investigations.

'We are continuing to hold the community in our prayers.'

The Bishop of Tewkesbury, the Rightt Reverend 
John Went, spoke at a eucharist 
service at St Paul's Church in Thornbury today, where he reminded 
parishioners they were 'part of a fallen humanity where tragic events 
happen'.

'It's good to come and share with you this morning in the eucharist as we come to terms with tragedy,' he said.

'Our
hearts very much go out to you as a church community and a wider 
community that will be stunned at this time and will have so much to 
come to terms with over the coming months and indeed years.'

He told journalists outside the church: 'I was deeply shocked as
the Bishop of Tewkesbury and deeply saddened to hear about John's death
in such tragic circumstances.'

Detectives have been carrying out house-to-house enquiries and have also examined CCTV images taken from the nearby Royal George pub

Mr Went said he had been due to meet Mr 
Suddards this morning to review his ministry after the first few months 
of his time in this diocese.

The tiny church in a country lane on the edge of the town was packed with people, with the service having been moved from the larger St Mary's Church, which remains behind the police cordon.

Curate Bruce Goodwin gave a prayer, saying: 'We come to you (God) in shock and grief and confusion of heart.'

Mr Went added in his statement this afternoon: 'As a diocese we are very keen to be here to support the church community.

'So I was thrilled that I was able to be with the church community this morning for a short act of worship and our concern as a diocese is very much to support the church community but also the wider community of Thornbury as they seek to come to terms with this terrible tragedy.

'Our hearts, of course, go out to John's immediate family and his close friends and we shall want as a church to offer all the support and love that they will need as they come to terms with their personal loss over the coming months.'
