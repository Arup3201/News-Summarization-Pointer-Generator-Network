U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has landed in China to seek its help in reining in its ally North Korea, which has threatened thermonuclear war on South Korea and America.

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for peace, dialogue and denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula during today's talks, according to the country's state-run news agency Xinhua.

Mr Kerry arrived in Beijing today to persuade Chinese leaders to exert pressure on North Korea to scale back 
its belligerent rhetoric and, eventually, return to nuclear talks.

Travelling
to Beijing for the first time as secretary of state, Mr Kerry made no 
secret of his desire to see China take a more activist stance towards 
North Korea, which in recent weeks has threatened nuclear war against 
the United States and South Korea.

As
the North's main trading partner, financial backer and the closest 
thing it has to a diplomatic ally, China has a unique ability to use its
leverage against the impoverished, isolated state, Mr Kerry said in the
South Korean capital, Seoul, yesterday before leaving for Beijing.

'Mr.
President, this is obviously a critical time with some very challenging
issues - issues on the Korean peninsula, the challenge of Iran and 
nuclear weapons, Syria and the Middle East, and economies around the 
world that are in need of a boost,' Mr Kerry told Chinese President Xi 
Jinping at the Great Hall of the People.

Mr
Kerry said after the meeting that his talks with Xi were 'constructive 
and forward-leaning', though he did not elaborate further.

Chinese state television quoted 
Premier Li Keqiang as telling Mr Kerry that rising tensions on the 
Korean peninsula were in nobody's interests. Foreign Minister Wang Yi 
called for peace, dialogue and denuclearisation of the peninsula, the 
official Xinhua news agency reported.

'All
sides must bear responsibility for maintaining regional peace and 
stability and be responsible for the consequences,' the television 
report paraphrased Li as saying.

'Disturbances and provocation on the peninsula and regionally will harm the interests of all sides, which is like lifting a rock only to drop it on one's feet.'

China had a testy relationship with Mr Kerry's predecessor, Hillary Clinton, believing her to be too abrasive in their disagreements over everything from human rights to territorial disputes like the South China Sea.

Threats: The U.S. Secretary of State arrived in China today to seek the country's help in reigning in a belligerent North Korea

'Clinton added fuel to the mistrust during her four-year term. We hope Kerry can pull it in the other direction,' China's widely read and influential Global Times tabloid said in an editorial.

Mr Kerry's visit to Asia, which will include a stop in Tokyo tomorrow, takes place after weeks of shrill North Korean threats of war since the imposition of new UN sanctions in response to its third nuclear test in February.

North Korea has repeatedly said it will not abandon nuclear weapons which it said on Friday were its 'treasured' guarantor of security.

North Korean television made no mention of the U.S. politician's visit today and devoted most of its reports to preparations for Monday's celebrations marking the birth date of state founder Kim Il-Sung.

These included a numerous floral tributes and grandiose flower show, foreign visitors seeing the sights of the capital ahead of the festivities and the unveiling of a monument in a provincial town.

But Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Workers' Party's newspaper, issued a fresh denunciation of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, saying: 'The outbreak of nuclear war has now become a fait accompli, owing to the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces.

'If the enemies dare provoke (North Korea) while going reckless, it will immediately blow them up with an annihilating strike with the use of powerful nuclear means.'

However, South Korea's Yonhap news agency, quoting a government source, said North Korea had not moved any of its mobile missile launchers for the past two days after media reports that as many as five missiles had been moved into place on the country's east coast.

Yonhap said there had been no signs of any movement by the mobile launchers since Thursday 'or that missile launches are imminent'.

Beijing, which sided with North Korea in the 1950-53 civil war against the U.S.- backed South, has been reluctant to apply pressure on Pyongyang, fearing the instability that could result if the North were to implode and send floods of refugees into China. It has looked askance at U.S. military drills in South Korea.

Xinhua said in a commentary that Washington had itself been 'fanning the flames' on the Korean peninsula with its shows of force.

'It keeps sending more fighters, bombers and missile-defence ships to the waters of East Asia and carrying out massive military drills with Asian allies in a dramatic display of preemptive power,' it said.

However, U.S. officials believe China's rhetoric on North Korea has begun to shift, pointing to a recent speech by China's Xi in which - without referring explicitly to Pyongyang - he said no country 'should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gain'.

Meetings: John Kerry has urged Pyongyang's ally China to help rein in the rogue state

Mr Kerry told reporters in Seoul that if North Korea's 30-year-old leader went ahead with the launch of a medium-range missile, he would be making 'a huge mistake'.

At a news conference in Seoul on Friday and in a U.S.-South Korean joint statement issued on Saturday, Mr Kerry signalled the U.S. preference for diplomacy to end the tension, but stressed North Korea must take 'meaningful' steps on denuclearisation.

The United States and its allies believe the North violated the a 2005 aid-for-denuclearisation deal by conducting a nuclear test in 2006 and pursuing a uranium enrichment programme that would give it a second path to a nuclear weapon in addition to its plutonium-based programme.
