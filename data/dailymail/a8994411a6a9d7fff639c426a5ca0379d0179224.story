A playwright who created a play about suicide bombers caused a major security scare when he threw a prop bomb away in a bin.

Ethan Fisbane had chucked out the fake bomb as he cleared out his flat in Manhattan ahead of moving home - but it was found by the building's caretaker who called the police.

A huge number of NYPD police officers descended on the area, including members of the Bomb Squad and Emergency Service Unit, while the Joint Terrorism Task Force was put on notice.

Scare: Playwright Ethan Fishbane caused a major security scare when he threw out an old prop bomb from his play about suicide bombers

The 23-year-old from New Jersey told the New York Post that he 'didn't think' when he threw the bomb away.

He added: 'I didn't think twice about it, because, literally, it's two blocks of clay, a calculator that's cut in half and some wires from a Gameboy.'

As detectives carried out door-to-door enquiries along the street, he realised what had happened.

'They came to knock on my door. At first, I didn’t know what 
they were talking about. But then I was like, "Oh, my God! I think 
that’s my prop. I think that’s mine",' he told the newspaper.

The playwright, who has decided not to produce any more plays about terrorists, said he felt reassured by how the police reacted.

'I felt the response was wholly appropriate. Even if it’s just a prop for a theater piece, they were on top of it,' he said.

Mr Fishbane's play titled 'American Suicide Bomber Association' was performed as if it were a conference, with actors discussing the best way to do suicide bombings.

It featured a twist ending where an actor seated in the audience would stand up to announce they had a bomb, thus 'bombing' the suicide bombing conference.

The experimental piece made its début at Dixon Place theatre in New York before touring to Indonesia and South Africa.

The playwright is a recent graduate from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he specialised in experimental theatre.
