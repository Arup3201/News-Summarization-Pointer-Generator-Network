Shares of SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) fell Wednesday after the theme park operator reported second-quarter profit and sales that missed Wall Street expectations and cut its outlook for the year.

The Orlando, Florida-based company also said it believes attendance during the period was hurt by negative publicity surrounding its treatment of killer whales, which are trained to perform tricks.

A documentary last year called Blackfish suggested that the company's treatment of the killer whales provokes violent behavior from them, which in turn has led to the death of trainers.

In captivity: Killer whales have never been violent towards humans in the wild but they have in captivity

On Wednesday, the company said promotions and discounts also hurt revenue in the April-June period. It cut its sales guidance for the year — it now expects revenue to drop 6 to 7 percent — and plans to cut costs.

For the three months that ended on June 30, the company reported net income of $37.3 million, or 43 cents per share. Analysts expected 60 cents per share, according to Zacks Investment Research. A year ago, SeaWorld reported a loss of $15.9 million, or 18 cents per share.

Revenue declined 1.5 percent to $405.2 million. Analysts expected $447.7 million.

SeaWorld shares dropped $8.41, or 30 percent, to $19.74 in midday trading. The stock is down 31 percent this year.

The New 
York Post reports that the documentary Blackfish shed so much light on
 the poor treatment of killer whales that a California lawmaker 
introduced a bill in April that would prevent the park from using Orcas for public performances.

After Change.org gathered 30,000 signatures
 for a petition asking for Southwest Airlines to end their partnership 
with Sea World they agreed to cut ties after more and more people were 
negatively influenced by the documentary.

The Killer Whale, also known as the Orca or Blackfish is the world's biggest dolphin and can live an average of 50 to 80 years, says National Geographic.

Killer Whales are actually dolphins and can be 30 feet or more in length and weigh up to 12,000 pounds

Whales are generally not violent towards humans, rather they feed on dolphins and other sea life.

No human has ever been injured by a killer whale in the wild but they have been aggressive towards human when they are kept in captivity.
