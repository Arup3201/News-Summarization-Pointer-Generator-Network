Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has paid more than $2.3 million for a luxurious beach-front apartment on Queensland's so-called 'Millionaires Row'.

The one-time Health Minister joins 11-time surfing legend Kelly Slater and five-time Moto GP world champion Mick Doohan as residents of the much-sought after address.

According to OzPropertyData, the stamp duty alone on Mr Dutton's new digs on Jefferson Lane, is more than $120,000.

The $2.3m Palm Beach property is a two-storey, four bedroom apartment with walk-on access to the beach

Happy days. Peter Dutton is congratulated by Governor-General Peter Cosgrove as he is sworn in as Immigration Minister. Mr Dutton is also celebrating the purchase of a $2.3m property on Queensland's 'Millionaires Row'

A report in the Gold Coast Bulletin states the secret purchase was the third-highest on the strip in the past year.

Mr Dutton snapped it up on December 15, just one week after Slater paid $2.15 million for his luxury apartment.

'We sold that property, we won't comment on buyers,' said McGrath Broadbeach's James Ledgerwood.

'Not only does it have ocean views but views all the way down the coastline,' said McGrath Broadbeach's James Ledgerwood

Mr Dutton's new southern Queensland abode boasts two levels and four bedrooms plus four car spaces

'What I can say is that's an exceptional property, a north facing corner position, not just does it have the views to the ocean, views also all the way up the coastline.' 

A nearby 5-bedroom Jefferson Lane property sold for $2.8 million just five months before their respective purchases. 

Peter Dutton, 44, was elected as Federal Member for Dickson in Queensland in November 2001.

He held the Health and Sport portfolio for just over a year, overseeing the push for the $7 Medicare co-payment before the former police officer was made Immigration Minister in last December's Cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

McGrath Broadbeach’s James Ledgerwood oversaw the sale of Mr Dutton’s new home.

Among his neighbours on 'Millionaires Row' will be Kelly Slater, 11-time world surfing champion, and Queensland's own superstar, 5-time MotoGP champion, Mick Doohan

The apartment has all the mod-cons and was the third highest price in the so-called 'Millionaires Row' in the past year

'That area is very popular, it's a southern strip where some very wealthy owners are now based after deciding to call it home, it's very close to the lifestyle of Burleigh and Coolangatta,' Mr Ledgerwood said.

'The southern end of the coast has developed a great culture.

'Beach front sales are always a combination of those residing for the long term and others securing a holiday home.

'You know that the prices pre-GFC were actually higher than they are now, but at the same time we've past the bottom now and prices are again on the increase, they are purchasing them from a long-term investment view.'
