Soccer mad: Kayo da Silva Costa was walking to a football school next to a Rio de Janeiro courthouse when eight heavily-armed mobsters burst out in a hail of bullets

An eight-year-old boy died in his grandmothers arms yesterday in Brazil after he was shot in the head during a botched gangland jailbreak.

Kayo da Silva Costa was 
walking to a football school 
next to a Rio de Janeiro courthouse when eight heavily-armed mobsters burst out of a car and opened fire in a bid to free two gang members on trial for murder and drug trafficking.

In scenes described by witnesses as 'like something from a Hollywood movie', leapt out of a car and sprayed the law courts with bullets killing two and injuring two.

The 'quiet and studious' youngster, who teachers revealed harboured dreams of becoming a professional footballer, died in grandmother Rosana Silva’s arms as bullets flew overhead. She
was hit by shrapnel.

A policeman, named as Sergeant Oliveira, also died at the scene after he was shot in the chest while trying to alert other officers to the assault.

It comes on the same day new figures were released revealing a rise in murders, robberies and muggings in Rio.

Another officer, Sergeant  Gonçalves, was shot in the head and is in a critical condition in the State Hospital Albert Schweitzer while an elderly woman, who has not been named, was hit in the stomach while travelling on a bus. She is said to be in a stable condition in the same hospital.

The gun battle erupted in Bangu, West Rio, close to where ex-footballer, Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos, was murdered earlier this week. His severed head was dumped outside his home in Realango, in the same West Rio district, after he was kidnapped from his shop by gunmen.  

Both officers involved at the courthouse fire-fight yesterday were from the 14th Military Police Brigade that investigated the businessman’s murder.

According to witnesses on Globo TV, 
eight gunmen pulled up outside the 1st Criminal Court of Bangu in two 
cars around 5.30pm. Four ran into the building opening fire on officers 
escorting 23 high-security prisoners to the start of a major trial for 
murder, drug trafficking, theft and conspiracy.

Bodies: According to witnesses on Globo TV, eight gunmen pulled up outside the 1st Criminal Court of Bangu in two cars around 5.30pm

The mobsters planned to break out two of Rio’s notorious gang ring-leaders, Alexandre Bandeira de Melo, 40, nicknamed the ‘Lice’, and Vanderlan Ramos da Silva, 30, known as ‘Chocolate’.  Both were former-leading drug lords in Rio’s favelas with links to Comando Vermelho (Red Command), the largest  organised crime syndicate in the capital.

'Four men in the first car got out and closed the street down, they had rifles and guns,' said an eye-witness to Globo TV, who declined to be identified.

'They told everyone on the street to 
stay calm. A policemen on the door, guarding the courthouse, spotted 
them and they shot him. There were between eight to ten men, all in 
black and they started shooting at the court. One had his face 
uncovered. I bent down with my sister by my car and waited for them to 
stop shooting. My car was hit by a lot of bullets,' the terrified 
eye-witness said.

Carlos 
Oliveirva, who witnessed the incident, told Record TV: 'There was 
shooting everywhere. About four cars were hit in the cross fire. I could
have been killed as well because it was random and terrible. The area 
here is always very busy at this time because there is a government 
registry office nearby.'

Botched: The mobsters inside the building were forced to escape from the back of the courthouse as their rescue attempt backfired. None of the gang members managed to escape. All were rounded up and taken back to prison

Another witness described the mayhem to Globo TV as 'something out of a movie'.

According to a police report, Sergeant Oliveira tried to run inside the courthouse to warn other officers of the attack. He was shot dead on the court steps. Sergeant Gonçalves, who was also on the stairs, was hit in the head.

Four gunmen entered the building and four stayed outside to give cover, spraying, among other things, a passing police car with bullets. The officers from the car leapt from the car and exchanged fire with the four gunmen.

But the rescue attempt backfired when the mobsters inside the building were overcome by officers and were forced to escape from the back of the courthouse. None of the gang members managed to escape and were rounded up and taken back to prison.

According to another witness at the scene, the four gunmen took the keys of cars parked at the court to make their getaway.

One of the cars used by the criminals in the attack was found at a petrol station a few miles away in Padre Miguel, shortly after 9pm on Thursday.

'It was an organised action carried out by a large number of people. Four managed to enter the court building armed with rifles,' said homicide detective, Alan Duarte. He added that the officers escorting the criminals had been surprised by the attack.

'We had no information that this was going to happen, so the police force was not strengthened,' he revealed.

Rio’s Secretary of State for Security, José Mariano Beltrame, said on Thursday night that he had instructed the transfer of Melo and Silva to different state prisons, 'considering the audacity and the consequences the actions caused.'  

The schoolboy who died was described by his football coach as a talented and rising star.

'Kayo was one of the team's top scorers in the league. His dream was to become a famous player. He was a very quiet and studious boy and always came here with his grandmother or mother,' Luiz Manoel Gomes Avila, director of the Bangu Atlético Clube futsal team told Globo.

As the World Cup approaches crime figures released this week by Brazil’s Institute of Public Security reveal a worrying upward trend in the past year.

Murders in Rio are up by 38.1 percent, an increase of 112, from 294 to 406. Overall robberies including street muggings and car thefts  have escalated to 82.2 percent, increasing from 345 reported cases to 629.

This comes despite security measures introduced by Rio State to improve safety, such as the Police Pacification Units in favelas, before international fans arrive in Brazil.
