A 18-month-old girl was pulled from the wreckage of a car crash without a scratch, despite four passengers including her mother dying in the horror accident, an inquest heard today.

Holly Hind was the only person to survive when the family car she was travelling in smashed head-on into a tanker and flew into the air.

Holly's mother Alison Hind, 28, was tragically killed along with her uncle Martyn Pugh, 47, after a summer trip to the seaside.

Mr Pugh's parents-in-law John Kehoe, 72, and Margaret, 65, who had joined them on the outing, were also killed in the accident, which happened on a country road near Aberystwyth, Wales.

An inquest heard how van driver Marcus Stallard, 42, pulled Holly from her car seat while surrounded by the twisted wreckage and her dead mother.

Mr Stallard said: 'None of the doors would open and there was silence, just silence.

'Then I heard a child starting to cry and realised there was someone still alive in the car.

'I tried to open the doors but couldn't, so I ran to my van and grabbed a hammer. I started smashing the windows to help the child and I managed to get her out of the car.'

Holly miraculously survived the crash with just a faint red mark on her forehead - despite the family Ford Focus travelling at around 50mph when it collided with the tanker.

Mr Stallard took Holly in his arms and tried to comfort her until an Air Ambulance arrived at the scene on the A44  in Llangurig, near Aberystwyth, and flew Holly  80 miles to hospital.

Scene: The 'dangerous' A44 in Powys was closed for 12 hours after the tragic crash

Died: Martyn Pugh, Holly's uncle, was driving the Ford Focus when it collided with the tanker at 50mph on a country road near Aberystwyth, Wales

Also killed: Mr Pugh's parents-in-law John Kehoe, 72, and Margaret, 65, who had joined them on the outing, also died in the accident

Holly's father Steve Hughes, 36, raced to her bedside at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and is now caring for her with the help of remaining family members.

Witnesses said they saw the Ford Focus 'stand up' on its front end with the force of the crash before smashing back down on to the road and spinning into the path of Mr Stallard's Ford Transit van.

The inquest at Welshpool, Mid Wales, heard that the cause of the crash remained a mystery.

PC Richard Jessop said it could have been a 'momentary lapse of concentration' by Mr Pew which cause him to veer across the road.

PC Jessop examined all three vehicles after the crash and said none of them showed any sign of defects or mechanical problems.

Neither van driver Marcus Stallard or the tanker driver John Knight were injured in the horror smash.

Powys coroner Andrew Barkley said: 'We will never know the cause of the crash but it could have been a momentary lapse of concentration by Mr Pew or a distraction from inside or outside the car.'

Mr Barkley recorded verdicts of accidental death.

After the inquest family member Tony Kehoe said Holly, now two, was being looked after well by her father in close knit village of Llanidloes.

He said: 'Holly is being well looked after by her father and members of the family.

'She is coming on well and doesn't seem to have been affected by the tragedy. Steve has lost his girlfriend but he has still got Holly to remember her by.'
