Police sources told ABC that detectives believed the death was a homicide and that the scene at Mr Gilbert Sr's home was a 'staged suicide'.  

Gilbert Jr was arrested in the Hamptons in September for second-degree criminal contempt, for allegedly violating a restraining order. He has not entered a plea and was due in court next month, according to ABC.

The Princeton graduate was upset that  his weekly allowance had been cut back, according to published reports, when he went to his parents' home in midtown Manhattan on Sunday afternoon. 

A source told the New York Daily News that Mr Gilbert Sr had cut back Tommy's weekly allowance to $300 and threatened to stop paying his rent.

Gilbert Jr lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea where, according to listings, guarantors were accepted on the $2,400-a-month rent.

The Ivy Leaguer, who was a regular fixture at Manhattan's black-tie benefits with society beauties on his arm, reportedly slipped past the doorman and into his parents' building shortly before the alleged attack at 3.30pm. 

According to The New York Post, Gilbert Jr went to his parents' eighth-floor apartment and asked his mother to leave to get him a sandwich.

The father and son were discussing 'differences in their relationship', according to The Wall Street Journal.

According to a Daily News report, he had the gun on his chest in an alleged attempt to make it look like suicide.

Gilbert Jr is reportedly being held at the NYPD's 17th precinct in midtown Manhattan after being arrested on Sunday night at his home 

He was taken to the 17th precinct in midtown Manhattan and questioned. A spokesperson told Daily Mail Online on Monday that the investigation was ongoing.  

Thomas Gilbert Sr started Wainscott Capital in 2011, growing the fund to a value of $200 million.

He attended Princeton and Harvard Business School before a 40-year career on Wall Street.  According to Wainscott Capital's website, he had extensive knowledge of the stock market, private equity, real estate and the fixed income market. 

His son, Tommy Gilbert Jr, attended The Buckley school on Manhattan's Upper East Side from kindergarten until eighth grade. Tuition costs around $35,000 a year. 

Noteable alumni of the school include actor James Harder, philanthropist David Rockefeller Jr and Robert Wagner, former deputy mayor of New York. 

He then went on to the $50,000-a-year Deerfield Academy in Western Massachusetts, which counts the King of Jordan and Prince of Jordan among its alumni.

After graduating from Deerfield in 2003, Gilbert Jr accepted a place at Princeton University where he graduated in 2009.

A friend told Daily Mail Online on Monday: 'He was a really nice person. He was smart, athletic and he went to Princeton. 

'He took some leave of absences from Princeton which is why it took him so long to graduate. He must have been really angry to do something so out-of-character.'

A classmate, who attended Deerfield with Gilbert Jr, also said: 'Tommy was my classmate. This story is an incomprehensible tragedy. My heart goes out to the entire Gilbert family.'

Details of Gilbert Jr's profession remain unclear but he was photographed on multiple occasions at black-tie society events.

The 30-year-old was pictured in March 2014 at the School of American Ballet's winter ball with Arielle Patrick, a 2012 Princeton grad, child of Manhattan private schools and now a PR director, who sources told the Daily Mail Online that he had dated.

Miss Patrick refused to confirm whether the pair had dated on Monday.

A fellow Princeton graduate told Daily Mail Online that Gilbert Jr was a 'highly disturbed individual'. 

Another friend told Today that 30-year-old Gilbert Jr had become 'volatile' in recent years. 

Friends in the 30-year-old's circle told Daily Mail Online that he loved surfing, was 'handsome and nice' but extremely quiet and never talked.

The family property is a $6,000-a-month rental apartment at 20 Beekman Place on 50th Street, a few blocks north of the United Nations on the east side of Manhattan.  

The building's porter told the New York Daily News that Gilbert Sr was 'friendly, very nice' and a 'gentleman'. 

'I immediately got a bad vibe,' the doorman told police, according to the Daily News. 'The kid got into the elevator before I got the chance to pick up the telephone.'

A neighbor, named as Bernard, said: 'Five minutes later he comes running out covering his face with a hoodie.'

Mr Gilbert Sr also owned a property in the Hamptons which was listed for sale at $11.5million.

The 2.5 acre-property has five bedrooms, four baths, a heated pool and screened in porch and sits in one of the area's most exclusive enclaves.

Wainscott Capital avoided losses which plagued other hedge funds in October last year, gaining 1.65 per cent that month.

In an interview with FINalternatives, Gilbert Sr attributed the success to their moderate risk profile.

'We’re not trying to beat all of the biotech funds, we’re basically trying to avoid drawdowns,' he said.

Named in the annual Who's Who In America list for five years running (1999-2004), Gilbert Sr started his career with a seven-year stint at Loeb Partners Corporation as managing director.
