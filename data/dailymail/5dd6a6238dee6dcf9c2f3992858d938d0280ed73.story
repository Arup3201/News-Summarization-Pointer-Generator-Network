Susan Hackett, 68, was swept off her feet and trapped in the bitterly cold seawater for more than an hour

A woman drowned after being caught out by the rising tide as she walked her dogs on a beach.

Susan Hackett, 68, was swept off her feet and trapped in the bitterly cold seawater for more than an hour.

Her daughter Emma, who was with her on the Mother’s Day walk, also became trapped but was rescued by coastguards.

It is thought the women were caught out when the tide came in very quickly at Cefn Sidan beach in Carmarthenshire, Wales.

Mrs Hackett’s brother, Brian Marsh said: ‘Emma told me they had walked along that beach hundreds of times and the water had only come up to the top of their wellies.

'This time there was a huge surge that came up to their chests. They didn’t know where it came from.’

He said that the women, who had eight dogs with them, were not only trying to keep their footing, but also trying to help the animals swim.

Walkers saw the women battling to stay above water and called for help, with a helicopter and two lifeboats arriving at the scene at about 5pm on Sunday.

Mrs Hackett was airlifted to hospital but she could not be revived. Her daughter was lifted into an inshore lifeboat after one of the crew jumped in to keep her head above water.

She was released from the West Wales General Hospital yesterday.

Five of the dogs are thought to have drowned but three survived and are being looked after by a local vet. Swansea coastguard spokesman Marc Lancey said: ‘At the moment we’ve got spring tides – which means we have the highest of the high tides and the lowest of the low tides.

‘When we have a spring tide, the rate the tide comes in increases and so does the volume of water.’

An RNLI spokesman said crews were on the scene within five minutes of being called out.

He added: ‘When the younger woman was back on land she confirmed she had been in the water for an hour.

'We were unaware of that when we launched.’ Despite the mild air temperature, the sea is still very cold and hypothermia would have set in quickly as the women tried to stay afloat.

Mr Marsh said his sister was ‘very slight’ which is why they think she did not survive after an hour in the cold water.

He added: ‘It is so very sad. This has been a huge shock to the family. We are all devastated.’

Mrs Hackett, who is believed to be a widow, moved to the village of Cynwyl Elfed, near Carmarthen, from Hertfordshire about ten years ago.

Her new partner visited at weekends and was due to move to Wales next year when he retired.

Residents said she was a quiet but popular woman who was known for her love of animals and the countryside.  

One villager said: ‘Everyone is very cut up about it – it is an awful tragedy for her family.’

An inquest will be opened later this week.
