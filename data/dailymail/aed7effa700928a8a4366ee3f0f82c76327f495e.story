The number of foreign students studying at British universities has reached a record high, fuelling fears that many will fail to repay their taxpayer-funded loans after they graduate.

More than 132,000 students from mainland Europe enrolled at UK institutions last year, a rise of 18 per cent since 2008.

The biggest jump in applications came from Romania, which saw a 28 per cent rise in 12 months, and Bulgaria, which saw a 23 per cent increase.

Rising costs: The amount of money being paid to European students studying at universities in the UK has topped £100 million for the first time (stock image)

The figures, by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, came as it was revealed that the amount of government money handed to EU students has topped £100 million for the first time.

Graduates eligible to repay their loans are also failing to hand back nearly £50 million.

Under EU law, students from any member state are eligible to apply to British universities and qualify for low-interest loans. They do not have to repay these until they are earning more than £21,000 a year.

The findings will raise concerns that many students have no intention of repaying the money and may simply return home.

Tory MP Brian Binley, a member of  the Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, said: ‘We are disadvantaged across the board with respect to Europe – in student loans, the Health Service and with people coming here for jobs.

‘The whole thing is to our disadvantage.’
