An orphaned black boy, growing up in Victorian Britain, becomes a hero on the football pitch for Tottenham Hotspur, despite suffering abuse from the terraces.

Then he goes on to become the first black officer in the British Army, mentioned in Dispatches and recommended for the Military Cross for heroism in the First World War.

It ought to be the most inspiring story. But at the same time, it is one of the most heartbreaking. Because at 29 Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was killed in action in France, and due to the colour of his skin he was never officially recognised for his gallantry.

And although he died a hero’s death in 1918, to this day no one knows where his body lies: his name is among the 30,000 soldiers with no known grave, remembered on the war memorial at Arras.

But now, with the help of War Horse 
author Michael Morpurgo, there is a chance that these omissions will be 
rectified.

Morpurgo says his latest novel was inspired by Tull’s story, 
and has called for him to be officially recognised with a posthumous 
medal and a statue outside the Imperial War Museum in London.

Such honours would be a far cry from Tull’s humble origins. His father, Daniel, the son of slaves, came to Britain from Barbados to work as a carpenter, settling in Kent and marrying a local woman. Walter was born in Folkestone in 1888.

But by 1897 both Walter’s parents had died and Walter and his brother Edward were moved to a children’s home in London’s East End. Edward was quickly adopted, leaving Walter alone.

Every morning before lessons he would have to wash in freezing cold water, clean at least 15 pairs of boots and scrub floors on his knees.

Then he started playing football and was soon signed by local team Clapton FC, who promptly won every cup available to them in 1908. Next season he was taken on as an inside forward by Spurs for a transfer fee of £10.

He was paid £4 a week, the top wage at the time. He became the first black outfield player at a First Division club. The only black professional footballer in Britain before him was goalkeeper Arthur Wharton.

But, at a time when there were very few black faces in Britain, Tull was to endure racial abuse from the terraces.

In October 1909, after a match against
 Bristol City, a reporter wrote of the City fans: ‘They made a cowardly 
attack upon him in language lower than Billingsgate. Tull is so clean in
 mind and method as to be a model for all white men.’

However, Tull was soon dropped from the 
Spurs first team, never to regain a regular spot. When war was declared 
in 1914, he volunteered and joined the Football Battalion 17th Middlesex
 Regiment.

He was promoted three times during training and was sent to France, close to the front line.

In 1916, despite having suffered severely from shell shock, he fought so courageously on the Somme that his commanding officers recommended promotion, and in 1917 he was made a second lieutenant.

After leading a raiding party across enemy lines on the Alpine Italian Front in the harsh winter of 1917-18, he was put forward for the Military Cross for his outstanding bravery and leadership and was mentioned in Dispatches for his ‘gallantry and coolness’ under fire.

But two months later, while crossing No Man’s Land on the Western Front in France, he was shot and killed. The fighting was so severe that his body was never recovered.

In those days, Army officers had to be ‘of pure European descent’.

By making him an officer, Tull’s superiors had thrown away the rule book. But after the war, the colour of his skin meant he was never awarded his Military Cross.

Now, the campaign to reverse this decision is gathering steam. As well as Morpurgo’s efforts, Northampton MP Brian Binley is supporting an online Number 10 petition calling for Tull to be posthumously awarded the medal.

Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South, also says Tull’s departure from Tottenham was more about the racism Tull encountered than football: ‘I believe Spurs were embarrassed by what happened and wanted to get rid of him.’

The MP says his fight has recently hit a ‘brick wall’ at the Ministry of Defence: ‘They gave me the excuse that a soldier couldn’t be awarded a Military Cross posthumously in those days. I found one who had but they weren’t interested.’

The campaign has coincided with a new book for children: Walter Tull’s Scrapbook by Michaela Morgan, and on Thursday a play, simply called Tull, opened at Bolton’s Octagon Theatre.

The Morpurgo novel inspired by Tull is A Medal For Leroy. Aimed at children, it is dedicated to Walter’s memory and tells of a boy finding out about his black RAF pilot father, who died in the war.

Morpurgo says he wants a Tull statue in London ‘so the children of today, black and white, can see how long and how honourably black people have been serving in the Armed Forces. I simply felt more people should know about this remarkable man’.

Walter Tull’s Scrapbook, by Michaela Morgan, is published by Frances Lincoln for £11.99. For your copy at £9.99 inc p&p, call the Mail Book Shop on 0844 472 4157 or go to mailbookshop.co.uk.
