David de Gea is the overwhelming favourite among Spain fans to replace Iker Casillas.

Casillas was at fault for Slovakia’s opening goal – misjudging Juraj Kucka’s 30-yard free kick – in Spain’s 2-1 defeat on Thursday.

And now Spanish fans have backed De Gea, who has been in fine form for Manchester United, to replace the under fire Real Madrid keeper.
