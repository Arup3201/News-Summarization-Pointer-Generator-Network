Former Arsenal forward Gervinho has signed a new deal with Italian club AS Roma which will keep him in Italy until June 2018.

The Ivory Coast striker, who failed to have much of an impact under Arsene Wenger during his two-year spell with the Gunners, has been a revelation since leaving England.

Playing on the wing for Arsenal Gervinho scored just nine league goals in his two seasons at the club, but, more often in his preferred striking position, he matched that tally in his first season with Roma.

Gervinho has been excellent for Roma since joining from Arsenal as the Italian side enjoyed a good season

The striker has also returned to his prominent role for the Ivory Coast as he rediscovered his best form

And he has started his second season in a similar vein of form scoring in Roma's first game of the season against Fiorentina with a tidy finish.

The result was an extention to his contract, which already had three years to run, which should allow him to stay with Roma until 2018.

Gervinho scored some important goals during his time at Arsenal but never really made the desired impact
