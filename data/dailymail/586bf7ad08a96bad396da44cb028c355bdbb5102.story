An ex-husband who allegedly stabbed his former wife 84 times before putting a pig mask on her face told police he could not remember the savage attack.

Anthony Novellino, 66, from Denville, New Jersey, was in court on Thursday for a hearing ahead of his murder trial. Two recorded interviews with Novellino were played to the Morristown court, the first time details of the grisly killing have been made public.

Novellino is accused of stabbing to death his ex-wife Judith, 62, after she returned to their home to collect belongings, 11 days after their divorce in June 2010.

On the tapes, Novellino can be heard 
saying he only remembers 'twice cutting her with the knife' and had 'no 
intention at all' of hurting her, according to NJ.com.

The 66-year-old suspect repeats
 these claims during the five hours he was interviewed by police. He 
also admitted that he had not wanted a divorce and blamed the separation
 on his wife's sister.

The
 suspect claims that it was his ex-wife who pulled a knife on him in the
 upstairs bathroom of their home on June 19, 2010 during an argument - 
but said he did not remember subsequently stabbing her dozens of times.

Novellino told police: 'I 
didn’t do what you said I did. I don’t know who would do that because I 
was the only one there.'

He added: 'In 15 seconds, everything happens. Your whole life changes in 15 seconds', according to NJ.com.

Anthony Novellino, from New Jersey, is on trial for the fatal stabbing of his ex-wife Judith in 2010 at their home

Judith Novellino was stabbed 84 times and a pig mask placed on her face when she went to collect belongings from her New Jersey home in 2010 following her divorce

Novellino claims that when he left the bathroom, he noticed a pig mask in a messy closet and 'picked it up and threw it in (the bathroom)'.

He was asked why he did not try to revive his wife or call 911. Novellino said he was 'nervous'.

Mrs Novellino, who has a daughter Christina and son Anthony, was found dead by a family member at the couple's detached suburban home.

Novellino, who went on the run in Washington state following his ex-wife's murder, said he had not planned to kill the high school teacher. He was captured following a five-day manhunt.

Judith Novellino was a teacher and librarian at Morris 
Catholic High School.

The pretrial hearing is due to begin again on Monday.
