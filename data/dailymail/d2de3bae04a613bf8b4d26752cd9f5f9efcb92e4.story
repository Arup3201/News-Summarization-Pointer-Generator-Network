Brendan Rodgers is ready to persist with Mario Balotelli in Liverpool’s starting line-up against Hull and give him the chance to turn his season around.

With just one goal in 10 matches since his £16million move from AC Milan, Balotelli’s displays have been so mundane that Liverpool may decide to offload him in January if it proves that he cannot adapt to their style of play.

The Italian striker was hauled off after 45 minutes of the 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid on Wednesday.

Rodgers described the substitution as ‘purely tactical’, but Balotelli has been heavily criticised for swapping shirts with Madrid defender Pepe at half-time.

Even though Rickie Lambert is waiting in the wings, Balotelli is expected to start on Saturday afternoon at Anfield against Steve Bruce’s side.

Liverpool’s manager would not shy away from making the big call to drop Balotelli but, for the moment, Rodgers is prepared to keep faith with the 24-year-old and he will lead the line as his side chase a third consecutive win in the Barclays Premier League.

It has been a difficult 48 hours for Balotelli, as he has been the subject of a complaint to Greater Manchester Police over allegations he verbally threatened a woman in the Wythenshawe area on Thursday afternoon after it was said she took photos of his £250,000 Ferrari.

His alleged victim told the Manchester Evening News: ‘I hadn’t even taken any pictures. He came and looked through the front window.

‘He was wearing a black beanie hat and he gave me a bit of a fright. I don’t care who he is, I won’t be threatened like that.’

What Liverpool could do with more than anything on Saturday is collecting three points with neither a hint of controversy nor the concession of a goal.

But that will be easier said than done against a Hull team for whom Rodgers says he has the utmost respect.

Such have been Liverpool’s travails in recent weeks that Rodgers has admitted to being up in his kitchen in the middle of the night, attempting to work out a formula that will get his team back in the form that saw them finish runners-up last year.

‘The other night I was up at 4.30am, down in my kitchen, looking and thinking of ways that I could make us better and improve,’ said Rodgers.

‘That is something I have got, a hunger to make this group better.

‘Yeah, we are looking to get balance in the team — balance is the most important thing in football — but with limited coaching time. That is something I have to look at definitely.’

Balotelli is just one of the problems that Liverpool manager Rodgers is still trying to figure out this season

Liverpool have conceded 19 goals in 12 matches this season and only kept one clean sheet in 18 games since March 30 but Rodgers has robustly dismissed bringing in a defensive coach, a topic that has been raised by supporters.

When asked if he had given thought to the idea, Rodgers said: ‘No. No. No chance. No chance. No. When I came in, I was asked whether I would have someone to come in and help the strikers score. We got goals. I think it is just the lack of coaching time that is impacting.

‘Listen, we can’t complain. We are in the big competitions and there is an expectancy on us, which there should be. We are Liverpool.

‘But in terms of that (recruiting a defensive coach), we don’t need it.’
