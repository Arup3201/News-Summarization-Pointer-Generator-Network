Surrounded by tales of fire-breathing dragons and white-bearded wizards, Tintagel Castle was perhaps the most appropriate place to spot a real-life gargoyle.

Or at least that's what Angela Smith thought she saw, when a sinister face appeared from the undergrowth, close to the legendary birthplace of King Arthur in Cornwall.

But the dog walker from Poole, Dorset, heaved a sigh of relief when she realised it was just the remains of a moss-covered tree stump, albeit one with a menacing 'face' and 'wing'.

Moss monster: Angela Smith spotted the tree stump peering out of undergrowth close to Tintagel Castle, Cornwall

Describing it as a cross between Harry Potter's nemesis Lord Voldemort and a flying monkey from The Wizard of Oz, the alarmed holidaymaker said:

'When I first saw the tree stump I did a
double take, as it gave me such a shock.

'Its ugly, angry face reminded 
me exactly of the gargoyles you see on top of old buildings in gothic 
films.

'I love nature and also architecture, so
I am always looking at the world around me, including the shapes and colours of 
plants and trees, as well as the designs on the exteriors of buildings.

'But I certainly didn't expect to see something like this!'

Popular with tourists, Tintagel Castle stands upon a dramatic setting on the north Cornwall coast and has been linked to the legends of King Arthur since the 12th Century.

Tintagel
Castle is a medieval fortification located 
on the peninsula of Tintagel Island, close to the village of Tintagel
in Cornwall, England.

The castle has a long association with the Arthurian legends, going back to the 12th century.

In the Historia Regum Britanniae, a fictional account of British history written by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Tintagel is described as the place where Arthur was conceived.

According to the tale, Arthur's father, King Uther Pendragon, was disguised by Merlin's sorcery to look like Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall and the husband of Ygerna, Arthur's mother.

The book was extremely popular and other Arthurian tales were produced in the late medieval period which claimed the king was actually born at Tintagel. Merlin the magician was also said to live below the castle in a cave.

Legendary: Tintagel Castle in Cornwall has strong links with the legend of King Arthur

In his Idylls of the King, Lord Alfred Tennyson also refers to the links between Tintagel and Arthur.

Despite these literary connections, no archaeologist has been able to find proof at the site that King Arthur existed or that the castle was linked to the legendary king.

The archaeologist C A Ralegh Radford declared in 1935 that: 'No evidence whatsoever has been found to support the legendary connection of the Castle with King Arthur'.

Many historians believe King Arthur was a completely mythical character, but others disagree, saying he may be based upon a British leader in the fifth century.

In the 
13th century, during the later medieval period, a castle was built on the site by 
Richard, Earl of Cornwall, which later fell into disrepair and ruin.

Archaeologists in the 19th Century took interest in the site as it became a tourist attraction, with visitors coming to see the ruins of Richard's castle.

Excavations in 1998 unearthed pottery from the 5th and 6th centuries at Tintagel Castle.

Today Tintagel Castle is a popular tourist destination managed by English Heritage.
