Experts predict  Ray Rice's suspension from the NFL will be dropped by mid-November, leaving him ample time to find another team to join before the season is halfway over.

But the true question lies in which team would be bold enough to him. 

The former Baltimore Ravens running back was fired from the team and put on indefinite leave on September 8, after surveillance footage was released showing the moment he struck his now-wife Janay Palmer in a hotel elevator. 

Back to work? The hearing over Ray Rice's suspension is scheduled for early November. If the suspension is dropped, he could potentially sign with a team by mid-season. Pictured above playing for the Baltimore Ravens

Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is still investigating the incident, and the NFL's response, but the issue of Rice's suspension is expected to be decided before that inquiry is published. 

Rice maintains he did not lie under oath when questioned about the incident by Commissioner Roger Goodell.

His legal team is expected to argue that even under the league's new domestic violence policy, first-time offender Rice could only be suspended for a maximum of six games.

That amount of games has already passed.

A hearing has been set for the beginning of November, which means Rice would find himself a new jersey by the middle of next month. 

CBSSports.com reports that two teams may take a chance by hiring Rice. 

The first is the Indianapolis Colts, whose coach Chuck Pagano used to work for the Ravens and 'thinks highly' of Rice. 

Another prospect is the New England Patriots, where coach Bill Belichick has strong ties to Rice's Rutgers University coach Greg Schiano.
