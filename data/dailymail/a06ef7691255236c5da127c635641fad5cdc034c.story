If you're the son of a billionaire banker, dropping £50,000 on a passionate kiss with Elizabeth Hurley is no problem.

Explaining it away to your wife, however, may prove a little more challenging.

Julian Bharti, 27, showed no sign of worrying about that, though, when he successfully bid for a kiss with the 49-year-old British actress at Elton John's annual ball near Windsor last night.

Standing up to claim his prize, the married father of three took to his task with gusto, clasping Hurley close to him and kissing her full on the mouth to the cheers of the watching celebrity crowd.

But today Mr Bharti, who runs his own mining investment business and has homes in Beverly Hills, Toronto, the Great Lakes and Florida, told MailOnline his wife of five years, Christy, wasn't in the least bit troubled by his kiss with the model and actress.

He said: 'She's totally cool with it.'

Married businessman Julian Bharti, 27, was the top bidder for a kiss with actress Elizabeth Hurley, 49

The couple, who met in 2008 and married in 2009, have three children, the oldest of whom, Sienna Monique Bharti, will be five this November.

Mr Bharti, who was privately educated at The York School in Toronto, Canada, before leaving in 2004 and going to McGill University in Montreal, is the eldest son of billionaire founder of Forbes & Manhattan founder and CEO, Stan Bharti.

After school he studied at McGill University in Montreal for two years before dropping out, saying: 'I felt I understood the capital markets business more than most of the professors'.

He went to work for his father in junior roles before going it alone and setting up an investment banking business, Delano Capital Corp, in 2008 - happily for him, this was perfectly timed to take advantage of the bargains in the market.

In an update written for his old school, Bharti said: 'I'm quite proud of my success at this age, but I do also admit that I had a huge leg-up into the business from my father.'

That same year he married blonde Christy, whom he described as 'the girl of my dreams', beside the lake at Muskoka, in Canada's Great Lakes.

When his wife gave birth to Sienna Monique in November 2009, Mr Bharti said: 'I really couldn't be happier with life.'

He
 told his old school he lived with his family in Toronto, but also spent
 time at his cottage in Muskoka and their 'winter home' in Florida.

In
 2011, he spent $5.5m on a 1930s house in Beverly Hills saying he 
intended it to be used as his family's holiday home close to his 
parents, who live in Los Angeles.

Mr Bharti's passionate kiss was the result of a charity auction at Sir Elton and David Furnish's annual 
Woodside Summer Ball, held last night in the grounds of their Windsor mansion.

After dinner in a candlelit marquee, Hurley, the star of Bedazzled, sparked frenzied bidding when she put herself under the 
hammer.

The
 pair then embraced in front of the celebrity crowd, with Hurley 
pulling a series of seductive poses as a slightly bewildered Mr Bharti looked on.

Hurley looked stunning in a short figure-hugging 
dress from Preen, accessorised with a fur stole and a pair of 
gold Paul Andrew heels.

She had arrived at the bash on the arm
 of shoe designer Patrick Cox, before chatting to showbiz friends Lulu, James
 Blunt, David Gandy and comic David Walliams and his model wife 
Lara Stone.

The money raised through the auction will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

Last night's party also had two particularly small celebrity guests: Sir Elton's sons with David Furnish, Zachary, three, and Elijah, 20 months.

The boys, who have just returned from St Tropez with their parents, were allowed to stay up just long enough to pose for a couple of family photos in the grounds of their country estate.

Guests including singer James Blunt and comedian Jimmy Carr arrived at the sprawling estate by rickshaws which were decorated with Chopard adverts.

Sir Elton treated his guests to a performance of his greatest hits as he took to the piano at one point in the evening.

The Crocodile Rock hitmaker previously said he will cut back on his touring commitments once Zachary joins school because he wants his children to have as normal an upbringing as possible.

He said in a previous interview: 'My children come with me everywhere because they’re very portable.

Picking up some tips? Lulu caught up with new singer Tom Odell

'When they’re not so portable, I’ll want to take them to school, so I want to get my lifestyle in order for that. We do have a nanny, but the kids are very portable.

'They come all the way round the world with us. Zachary went to Australia twice before he was one and he’s been to Hawaii twice.

'That’s 
the great thing about very young children – they come wherever you are 
and it’s not that much of a big deal to put them on a plane.

'Yes we do have a fantastic lifestyle, but we’re hands-on with our kids too.'

Later on in the evening, guests were 
treated to further performances from Gary Barlow, James Blunt and a DJ 
set from Fatboy Slim.

Sheer delight: Ellie wowed in a see-through ensemble which had gems scattered throughout

Betrothed: James Blunt looked proud to have his fiancée on his arm
