Its saddle has supported the world’s most famous bottom across 3,000 miles of tough terrain.

Now the bespoke bike that Pippa Middleton rode across America last month is to be sold to raise money for The British Heart Foundation. 

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister has 
raised more than £20,000 for the charity from donations, but she is 
hoping to double that by selling off the £2,500 Dassi bike in an auction
 on its website today.

The money is going towards the BHF and the Michael Matthews Foundation, named after a close friend of Pippa’s who died in 1999 aged just 22.

‘The challenge of riding across the Rockies, coping  with the heat of the Arizona desert  and climbing over 170,000 feet in the six days was incredibly tough, but every inch of the 3,000-mile race was worth it, to help the BHF,’ she said.
