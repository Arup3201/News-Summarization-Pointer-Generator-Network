A 17-year-old boy has been named prom queen at his high school and says he's making a point about gender labeling and discrimination.

Nasir Fleming won the title last week at Danbury High School in Connecticut, where he's a popular senior. He was nominated as prom king and as prom queen but decided to be considered only for queen.

Fleming told the News Times newspaper for a story on Tuesday that he's been openly gay since sixth grade and has struggled with bullying.

He said he isn't sure whether the students who submitted his name were making fun of his sexuality but decided it was a good opportunity to make a point about the importance of being who you are.

'Either way, I'm still fabulous,' he said.

Fleming said students at the prom were supportive and erupted in cheers when he won.

His date Amanda Datillo told reporters that Fleming was 'happy and giddy.'

'I was flabbergasted,' he told the News Times newspaper. The audience was surprised and extremely supportive. The audience was more excited than I was.'

Fleming said his selection as prom queen is a step forward for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people - but he wasn't expecting to win. His date to the prom, senior Amanda Dattilo, said the honor left him truly stunned.

'Afterwards,' she said, 'he was all happy and giddy.'

Danbury High's principal, Gary Bocaccio, said students nominate their classmates and anyone can be nominated for king or queen. He said he didn't know if Fleming was the school's first male prom queen.

The 17-year-old senior Nasir Fleming says he is gay and has been out since the sixth grade and has struggled with bullying for much of his young life because of his sexual orientation

Fleming posted a video on his Youtube account of the magical event along with a statement.

'Even though I identify as male, winning this title is a statement against transphobia,' the statement reads.

'As gay people, more or less, are becoming accepted in society, transgendered people are still discriminated against severely.'

'If I can win a title that is outside of my gender, there is no reason why a trans-person should have any problems winning titles in his/her gender. Stop the hate, start the love.'

Unfortunately there were a few negative comments on his Youtube page as well after he posted the video.

One commenter claimed that Fleming was 'making a mockery' of the prom tradition.

Fleming said merely that he 'loves controversy' and expected backlash when posting the video but was shocked to see comments coming from adults.

'It's so upsetting when you see a 45-year-old making comments about a 17-year-old,' Fleming said. 'It's disgusting.'

He said he doesn't blame kids for their negative opinions regarding his life choices and sexuality.

'I didn't blame the kids,' he said. 'It's never the kids' fault. It's the parents' fault.'

'We need to push past tolerance and start having acceptance,' he concluded.
