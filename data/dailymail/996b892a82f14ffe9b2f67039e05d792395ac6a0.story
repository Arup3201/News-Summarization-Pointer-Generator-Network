A father upset over his daughter's lifestyle chopped off her head with a sword before parading it around his village, police said.

Marble miner Ogad Singh's 20-year-old daughter had been living with her parents in the village of Dengari in Rajasthan, India, after leaving her husband two years ago.

Police Superintendent, Umesh Ojha, said Singh had been upset by his daughter having affairs with men, and became enraged when she eloped with one of them two weeks ago.

Singh forced her to return home yesterday and beheaded her today with a sword before surrendering to police, Ojha said.

As India modernises young people are increasingly resisting traditions like arranged marriage and limits on women venturing outside their parents' or husbands' homes, resulting in sometimes violent clashes with their parents.
