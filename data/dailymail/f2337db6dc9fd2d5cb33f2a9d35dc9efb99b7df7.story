A spokeswoman Pam Wiese says someone reclaimed the sheep, named Gage, Tuesday evening. 

Gage shares a shed with two chickens, when he isn't in his owner's house.

Weise says the owner doesn't know how Gage got loose. 

The owner learned about his whereabouts from Facebook because of publicity surrounding the animal.

Weise says the owner had several photos of Gage to prove he's her pet. 

Gage is used to walking on a leash and doesn't seem to mind that the holiday apparel he donned appears to have been designed for a dog. 

The Humane Society had said the sheep will be held for at least three days before being put up for adoption.
