16-year-old says she loves Rylan

Said she saw the hidden Tulisa and that they're still in touch

Has hopes of launching a vintage-inspired fashion line

16-year-old singing sensation Ella Henderson captured the nation's heart when she sang for her late grandfather on this year's X Factor.

And since she first appeared on the hit ITV show, the humble Grimsby girl's life has been turned upside down.

From Adele lauding her as 'amazing on Twitter to record companies fighting to sign her, the young starlet's future is most certainly looking bright.

Young starlet: Ella Henderson, who would love to launch her own fashion line, warmed up ahead of the UK's first Catwalk on Ice from Very.co.uk

'Life has been amazing since X Factor. My schedule is so manic, I was even supposed to be working on Christmas day but I have managed to cancel it as I want to spend time with my family,' she told MailOnline.

Although a shock singing showdown between her and James Arthur saw her leave the competition earlier than expected, the teenager maintains that the right man won.

She said: 'The last two in the final, Jaheme and James, were the right two. They are both winners.'

The down-to-earth singer became extremely close with her fellow contestants during her time on the show, particularly boy band Union J.

'Seeing everyone on Sunday night was amazing. It was really fun to sing together and it was like reuniting a family. I love Rylan, he is so fun to be around,' she said.

As for her mentor Tulisa, who was unsurprisingly gutted when Ella was voted out of the competition, the pair are still in touch.

Speaking about their relationship, Ella said: 'We are still in contact and we text which is nice. I loved having her as a mentor, I saw the hidden Tulisa and her warm side.

'As much as we were chalk and cheese, we had lots in common.'

Tulisa has spoken out in recent interviews saying the young pop star is destined for greatness, and that is exactly what's on Ella's agenda.

Aside from her obvious singing career, Ella would love to bring out her own fashion line and got a foot through the fashion door last night at the Very.co.uk on ice fashion show.

'I love Very, their catwalk on ice is very exciting and I love what Fearne and Holly have done for the brand.

'I would love to do my own fashion line. It would be very vintage-inspired and represent my style which is very fifties with a modern twist. It would be classy and timeless.'

Nervous: Ella wasn't as confident on the ice rink as she is on the stage

The budding fashionista, who has become somewhat of a style icon for her young fans, was lucky enough to have kept some of the outfits she wore on the show.

'I got to keep some clothes which is amazing. I got a big suitcase and threw it all in.

'I have loved dressing up and doing the glamorous shoots but usually I just love hopping in a onesie with my hair scraped back,' she said.

Despite favouring the more casual look, Ella was of course looking glamorous last night when she skated onto Very.co.uk's first ever catwalk on ice.

The young star looked very nervous as 
she slowly made her way down the runway past a freezing cold audience 
that included cast members from TOWIE and Made In Chelsea.

Despite wowing television viewers with her powerful voice, Ella didn't grace the audience with any renditions.

But she will be partaking in the X Factor tour in January which she is very excited about it.

She said: 'Fingers crossed but let's just say the future is looking bright.'
