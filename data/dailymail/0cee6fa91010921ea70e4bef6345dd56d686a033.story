More than a decade after fragments of an ancient Egyptian collar were found in Greece, an artist has pieced the 2,300-year-old ornate item of jewellery back together. 

The collar is painted in a variety of colours and features images depicting the Egyptian god Horus as well as goddesses believed to be Isis and Nephthys, the goddess of mourning. 

Researchers from Penn State University found the fragments in a tomb in Thebes, north of Athens, and it is thought to have been worn by the mummy of an undertaker, or Padihorwer.

Researchers from Pennsylvania found fragments of the collar, pictured, in a tomb in Greece. The 16-inch jewellery is painted in a variety of colours and shows the ancient Egyptian god Horus among other religious symbols of that time including the jackal-headed Anubis, associated with the afterlife

There were two main types of collars 
worn by ancient Egyptians.

Wesekh collars, which means wide 
collars, were traditionally made of beads and worn by by royalty, 
although not exclusively.

When a person died, a collar made from cartonnage was painted with religious or traditional ancient Egyptian symbols and presented to the deceased by family members.

After a person was mummified, the collar was fitted and buried with the mummy.

The human remains of the mummy who wore the collar found in Thebes have been removed, yet a mud-clay seal discovered nearby suggests it belonged to a wealthy undertaker, also known as Padihorwer.

Researchers claim ancient records additionally confirm that such a man was buried in 
Thebes at the same time.

Also pictured on the collar is a Ba bird – a bird with a human head – which is said to represent the soul of the mummy and lotus flowers blossoming, which were a symbol of Upper Egypt.

There is additionally a deity pictured that researchers claim is Anubis, a god with a jackal’s head associated with mummification and the afterlife. Anubis was the son of goddess Nephthys. 

The collar is made from an ancient Egyptian material called cartonnage, traditionally created using linen or papyrus covered with plaster. 

Fragments of the 16.5-inch collar were found during excavations in 2000 and 2002 by a team of researchers led by Professor Susan Redford.

When pieced together, the collar is almost nine inches tall.

Professor Redford told LiveScience that the fragments ranged from ‘palm-sized to dime-sized’ and described the project as a ‘giant jigsaw puzzle’. 

The human remains of the mummy who would have worn the collar are thought to have been removed or destroyed, yet Redford also found a mud-clay seal nearby that gives clues to its owner.

The human remains of the mummy who wore the collar found in Thebes have been removed, yet an inscription written in a mud-clay seal, pictured, found near the fragments suggests it belonged to an undertaker, or Padihorwer. It is thought the collar was presented to him as he was mummified

An inscription on the seal makes reference to a man called Padihorwer, believed to be a wealthy undertaker, and ancient records confirm that such a man was buried in Thebes at the same time, according to Redford.

The collar, seal and other artefacts were found in a tomb originally built around 3,300 years ago for a 
butler named Parennefer who worked for the pharaoh Akhenaten.

Arizona Egyptian Expedition.
