Hackers targeting Sony computers may still have access to the company's servers. 

The company suffered a series of embarrassing leaks after a group of hackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace infiltrated its systems and stole huge amounts of data.

But investigators still can't confirm to Sony bosses whether the hackers have been shut out of the company's systems, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton has been trying to fix the mess over the controversial movie 'The Interview,' which has amassed $18 million since its Dec. 25 release

'It took me 24 or 36 hours to fully understand this was not something we were going to be able to recover from in the next week or two,' CEO Michael Lynton told the newspaper.

If the computer network does remain secure, with no further leaks, it is expected to be fully operational again within two months, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

However, the hackers have so far only released a fraction of the 100 terabytes they claim to have originally stolen.

Leaks have included email exchanges between Sony executive Amy Pascal and film producer Scott Rudin in which racist jokes were made about President Barack Obama and Angelina Jolie was branded a 'minimally talented spoiled brat.'

Faced with cyber attacks, Sony executives at first said they wouldn't release 'The Interview' but then decided they'd distribute it online

So far, the movie has grossed some $18 million, despite not being shown in many American cinemas

The attack, suspected to be the work of North Korea, aimed to cancel the release of comedy film 'The Interview,' which parodied the country's dictator Kim Jong-Un.

The film was pulled prior to its release but this decision was reversed after the backlash.

So far, 'The Interview' has grossed $18million (£11.6million), despite not being shown in many American cinemas following the threat of terrorist attacks by Guardians of Peace. 

With $15million (£9.7million) of its $18million earnings coming from online sales, it is Sony Pictures' highest grossing online release, helping offset its $44million (£28.6million) budget.

Lynton told the Wall Street Journal that the company had to improvise majorly to get work done in the aftermath of the attacks.

Executives established a phone tree to pass information from person to person. The payroll department found an old machine to cut paychecks manually. Cell phones and notepads became the norm.

Meanwhile, Lynton has been seeking wider distribution for 'The Interview' in theaters and online.

'I have tried to make sure all the decision-making related to this incident comes back to me so that, as much as possible, the operating groups are not distracted from the normal business they have to do,' he told the Wall Street Journal.
