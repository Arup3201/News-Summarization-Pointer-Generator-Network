Afghanistan has made little progress in the way it treats women in the past decade, a Human Rights watch report claims.

Hundreds languish in jail for so-called 'moral crimes' such as running away from abusive husbands or forced marriages.

Those who leave are, in many cases, treated as adulterers and end up in prison.

HRW even found one case where a woman
was in prison after being stabbed in the head, chest and arms with a screwdriver by her husband 
because she had invited another man to their house.

The husband remains at large because the injuries were not life threatening.

Some 400 women are in jail for ‘moral crimes’.

The statistics are particularly shocking as they come more than ten years after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan. One of stated aims of regime change in the Taliban-controlled country was to improve the desperate plight of women.  

Under the Taliban, they were forced to wear body-and-face 
covering burkas and were not allowed out of the house without a male 
family member as an escort.

The
HRW's report said police, prosecutors and judges routinely ignore women’s 
accusations of abuse, arguing even in the face of physical evidence that
women are either lying about the abuse or making it seem more severe 
than it was.

'What’s needed
first is the political will on behalf of the Afghan government to 
prosecute violence against women,' Kenneth Roth, executive director of 
Human Rights Watch, told reporters in Kabul.

'Police,
with a crime victim sitting in front of them, see a criminal instead,' 
said Heather Barr, the group’s Afghanistan researcher and author of the 
report.

The report is based on interviews in October and November with 58 women and girls in Afghanistan.

President Hamid Karzai has announced a blanket pardon of woman in recent times but the jails keep filling up.

A spokesman for the Supreme Court said that men and women are treated equally in Afghanistan’s laws and courts.

'The
courts of this country hear equally cases of all Afghan citizens, 
without paying attention to whether they are men or women,' spokesman 
Abdul Wakhil Omery.

He
said the chief justice had seen the Human Rights Watch report, but did 
not find specific enough evidence to prove wrongdoing or negligence in 
any individual cases.

Women's rights activists have said that they are worried President Karzai will abandon promises to protect women's rights as he tries to court the Taliban for peace talks.

Neither the Interior Ministry, which controls the police and the 
prisons, nor the attorney general's office responded to calls seeking 
comment.

A spokesman for the Supreme Court said that men and women are treated equally in Afghanistan's laws and courts.

Afghanistan is widely regarded as one of the worst places in the world to be a woman. A report on domestic violence compiled in 2008 estimated that 87 per cent of females had been sexually, physically or psychologically abused at some point.

Half of these women said they had been physically abused.

The UN estimates that 70 to 80 per cent of Afghan marriages are forced with girls frequently married at a very early age. There is also a high maternal mortality rate.

HRW says that an Afghan woman dies every two hours from pregnancy-related causes.
