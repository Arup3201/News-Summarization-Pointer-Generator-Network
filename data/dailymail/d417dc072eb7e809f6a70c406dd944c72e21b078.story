In critical conditon: Daniel von Bargen, pictured in the 1999 film Universal Soldier: The Return, shot himself in the head on Monday

Former Seinfeld actor Daniel von Bargen was left fighting for life after shooting himself in the head in an apparent suicide attempt.

Von Bargen - who played Mr Kruger in the hit U.S. comedy - called 911 himself and told the operator he had shot himself in the head on Monday morning.

The 61-year-old American actor told the dispatcher: 'I've shot myself in the head but it didn't work... I need help.'

When asked where he shot himself, he replied: 'I shot... in my temple.'

When asked if the shooting was an accident, the actor replied: 'I was supposed to go to the hospital 
and I didn't want to. They 
were supposed to amputate at least a few toes.'

Authorities confirmed that they were dispatched to his apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio shortly afterwards.

In a recording of the 911 call, the emergency services can be heard arriving and shouting at Von Bargen to keep his hands visible and asking him if there are any other guns in the apartment.

On the tape, obtained by website TMZ, Von Bargen tells the dispatcher: 'My gun is lying next to me on the bed. It is a .38 colt. I can't open my eyes.'
