She is famed for her flawless complexion and at the age of forty she doesn't have a wrinkle in sight.

And while Gwyneth Paltrow hasn't succumbed to any plastic surgery like many of her tinsel town friends, she is not averse to using products and treatments and has lately admitted to using Thermage - dubbed 'the ironing treatment' - to keep her wrinkles at bay.

The A-list actress said: 'I don't mind a few wrinkles and freckles. I had this laser treatment recently, Thermage, and it took a couple of years off my face but I haven't had any plastic surgery yet.'

Beating the wrinkles: Gwyneth Paltrow has admitted to having a laser treatment called Thermage that helps beat her wrinkles

The cosmetic treatment, that is also favoured by the likes of Amanda Holden and Kim Cattrall, helps tighten and smooth the top layer of the skin by plumping up the lower layers.

The aim of Thermage is to boost the levels of the collagen in the lower layers of the skin to create a tightening effect.

However, unlike lasers and tools such as the Dermaroller (a roller with lots of little needles on it), Thermage aims only to 'damage' the lower levels of the skin, and not the top level, which it does by using radio waves that trigger the collagen production.

Dr Rita Rakus is reportedly Amanda 
Holden's preferred doctor to use for the treatment. Her London clinic 
has been using Thermage for more than five years, treating more patients than anyone in Europe.

Dr Rita Rakus said: 'Thermage is a radiofrequency skin tightening treatment that heats the deepest layers of your skin to help tighten existing collagen and stimulate the body’s natural renewal of collagen.

'It’s perfect for targeting wrinkles and fine lines around the mouth, eyes or forehead, and further on in the ageing process Thermage is great for decreasing hooding in the eye area, tightening loose jowls and creating definition in the jawline, as well as firming up sagging skin under the chin.

'This creates subtle, natural looking results like smoother, tighter skin, softened wrinkles and lines and an overall younger looking appearance, without having to go under the knife.'

But it doesn't come cheap.

Patients who want their face treated have three options - full face (£3,900), half face (£2,900), or just eyes (£1,900).

But the process, which works in a 
similar way to a microwave oven, has some worrying potential side 
effects from facial burns to scarring.

Dr Rakus said: 'Most people will see optimum results after about six months, but some people, who have poor circulation, and those with very sun-damaged skin, can have a slower response, so a top-up treatment can help.

'People say it hurts, but to me it just tingled and felt a bit like I'd had sunburn. It's given me the results of a facelift without having to go under the knife,' she added.

Amanda and Gwyneth are certainly convinced, and they're not alone. Another Thermage fan is supermodel Linda Evangelista, who said: 'For me, it's for enhancement, like hair colour or make-up.'
