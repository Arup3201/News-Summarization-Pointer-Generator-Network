Real Madrid star Angel Di Maria is set to join Paris Saint-Germain in a deal worth £63million, according to reports in Spain.

Marca report that the Argentina playmaker will become Real's record sale, beating the £42.5m received last summer from Arsenal for Mesut Ozil.

The one stumbling block to the deal could be UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations, as the French champions have already spent £50m buying David Luiz from Chelsea.

Paris-bound? Reports in the Spanish media suggest Angel Di Maria will be sold by Real Madrid to PSG for £63m

Reports: Monday's edition of Marca (left) says that Di Maria is set to move for €80m (£63m), while AS (right) leads on Carlo Ancelotti's expectations the Argentina playmaker will return for training on August 5

Still here: Ancelotti, pictured at Saturday's friendly with Inter Milan, says no deal has been agreed for Di Maria

Pivotal: Real Madrid forward Di Maria was key to the club's Champions League success last season

Wanted: Louis van Gaal is a keen admirer of Di Maria and would like to sign him for Manchester United

In order to bring in Di Maria, PSG would have to offload one of their star assets, most likely the unsettled Edinson Cavani.

But
 it may be possible for them to take Di Maria on a one-season loan to 
bypass the regulations before signing him permanently next summer.

However,
 Real manager Carlo Ancelotti still expects the player, who helped 
Argentina to the final of the World Cup, to return to training on August
 5. 

When asked if Di Maria 
was set to leave the Bernabeu, Ancelotti replied: 'There is nothing new 
in the market. Di Maria finished the World Cup and he is resting.

Surplus? Real have already signed Toni Kroos (left) and James Rodriguez (right) in midfield this summer

On target: Gareth Bale scored Real's only goal in a 1-1 draw with Inter Milan but his side lost on penalties

VIDEO Ancelotti predicts big season for Bale 

'He will return on August 5 to start (training) together with his team-mates.'

The
 European champions are currently on tour in the United States and were 
beaten on penalties by Inter Milan in a friendly in California on 
Saturday after drawing 1-1 in normal time.

Gareth Bale scored a spectacular long-range goal during normal time.

Real have already brought in Colombia playmaker James Rodriguez and German World Cup winner Toni Kroos this summer.

Reliable: Ancelotti says he does not need another striker because he already has Karim Benzema (pictured)
