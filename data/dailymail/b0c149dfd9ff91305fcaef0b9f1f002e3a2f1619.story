Casey Anthony may have received part of a $600,000 donation made by Dr Phil to her parents’ charity, it has been claimed.

The money was handed over after George and Cindy Anthony were interviewed on the TV show in September.

It was destined for the Caylee Marie Anthony Foundation, set up in memory of the daughter Anthony had been acquitted of killing.

But in papers filed as part of a defamation suit, lawyers claim that a portion of the cash has gone to the 26-year-old herself. They do not specify how much she received.

Anthony was sensationally cleared of murdering Caylee, whose body was found in a bag dumped in woodland, a year ago this month.

In a trial which gripped the nation, the jury heard how Anthony had initially claimed her two-year-old had vanished

She  told them an elaborate tale in which a fictitious babysitter she dubbed ‘Zanny the nanny’ kidnapped her daughter.

High-profile: Casey Anthony sits in court during her sentencing at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando, Florida, July 7, 2011

But prosecutors alleged that little 
Caylee had actually drowned in the  swimming pool and her mother had 
then got rid of her body.

Anthony was acquitted of murder but found guilty of lying to the authorities, who maintained that the babysitter never existed.

In a bizarre twist, she is now being 
sued by a woman called Zenaida Gonzalez – who has the same name as the 
fictitious ‘Zanny the nanny’. 

Ms Gonzalez claims her life was ruined by being falsely associated with the case.

Her attorney Matt Morgan said papers 
lodged Tuesday included information about the donation, which was made 
by Dr Phil McGrew who hosts the Dr Phil show

It was reported in the Orlando Sentinel that Morgan said: 'Our sources have indicated that she has 
received money directly from her mother, Cindy.'

The new filing is the latest in a 
number of requests for information ahead of the civil trial which is due
to start in January next year.

George and Cindy Anthony's lawyers or lawyers for Anthony haven't commented on the report.

There has been much public anger following the establishment of the Caylee Marie Anthony Foundation in 2008.

The foundation was set up to assist 
the families of missing children, but through the process of the murder 
trial it seemed to become inactive.

After Casey Anthony's acquittal she 
and her parents stayed out of the media spotlight until the CBS 
interview with Dr Phil which received a lot of attention and criticism.

Capturing hearts: Caylee Marie Anthony, 2, daughter of Casey Anthony, went missing in June 2008 and was found in woods near her grandparents house six months later

A website was created for the foundation, but the link does not currently work.

The site had stated: 'Organization 
administrators will work closely with families of missing children to 
provide needed support, which will be focused mainly on the collection 
and dissemination of information about the missing child in an effort to
facilitate widespread awareness.'

Such was the concern about the 
foundation's work that a Caylee Marie Anthony Foundation Watch group was
set up on Facebook to monitor the organisation.
