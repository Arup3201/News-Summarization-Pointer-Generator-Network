One of the men suspected of murdering poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko wanted to be a 'porno star' and had no links to the gas and oil industry as he claimed, an inquiry has heard.

Dmitri Kovtun struggled with a drink problem and worked as a waiter and pot washer in restaurants in Germany before he reunited with his childhood friend, former KGB officer Andrei Lugovoi, in Russia in June 2006, his former wives said in police interviews read to the Royal Courts of Justice.

Both men are prime suspects in the murder of Mr Litvinenko, 43, who died nearly three weeks after he consumed tea laced with polonium-210 on November 1, 2006 at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. They deny any involvement and remain in Russia.

Detective Inspector Craig Mascall from the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit told the inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's death that British officers travelled to Moscow to interview Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun in December 2006.

During the interview, Mr Kovtun listed his jobs as director general of gas and oil provider Global Project and as an employee of Continental Petroleum Limited, the inquiry heard.

But in an extract of a police interview given by his ex-wife Inne Hohne, which was read to the court, she said: 'Dmitri wanted to be a porno star. He never said anything about any brokerage deals or sales. I have now read his interview in (German newspaper) Spiegel and have read that there was trade with gas and with oil. I can only say that this has absolutely nothing to do with Dmitri.'

Mr Kovtun's second wife Marina Wall also told police her ex-husband had worked as a waiter and pot washer in restaurants in Germany before he began working with Mr Lugovoi in Russia.

Addressing Mr Mascall, Andrew O'Connor, counsel to the inquiry, said: 'So there is a clutch of documents apparently asserting that Mr Kovtun is running a company, is involved in oil projects. On the face of it, not entirely consistent with his earlier life.'

Mr Mascall replied: 'There is evidence from other witnesses who say Mr Kovtun was a bit of a dreamer and he suggested he was going to do all sorts of projects when he left Germany, but I would be speculating. He would appear to have done very well for himself.'

The inquiry heard that Mr Kovtun, left, and Mr Lugovoi, right, have known each other since childhood although they both deny any involvement in Mr Litvinenko's murder who died after drinking radioactive tea

Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi had known each since childhood and attended the same military academy in Russia, the court heard.

Mr Kovtun was stationed in Germany with the Russian army but fled to Hamburg and sought political asylum after getting married, the inquiry was told. He later split from his first wife because she said he had a 'drink problem,' Mr Mascall said.

The inquiry heard that Mr Lugovoi, now a Russian politician, was in hospital for exposure to radioactive material when Scotland Yard officers questioned him in Moscow.

In a newspaper interview two years after Mr Litvinenko's death, Mr Lugovoi said he believed the murdered spy was a 'traitor' and that anyone who caused damage to Russia should be 'exterminated', the inquiry into his death has heard.

In an extract of the interview shown to the inquiry, Mr Lugovoi was asked whether he agreed with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) that Mr Litvinenko - who worked for the British intelligence services after moving to the UK - was a 'traitor'.

He replied: 'I think so as well. That doesn't mean that a traitor has to be immediately killed.' He added: 'If someone has caused the Russian state serious damage, they should be exterminated. This is my firm belief and the belief of any normal Russian.'

The inquiry heard Mr Lugovoi told embassy staff his salary was 285,000 roubles when he applied for a travel visa to visit the UK in 2006, while Mr Kovtun said he earned 65,000 roubles a month.

Mr O'Connor asked Mr Mascall: 'Those two men are currently wanted for the offence of murder? The murder of Mr Litvinenko?'

He replied: 'That's correct.'

Mr O'Connor asked what action would be taken should either men return to the UK.

Mr Mascall replied: 'They would be arrested for the offence of murder.'

Mr Lugovoi, pictured, told one newspaper that Mr Litvinenko should be 'exterminated' as he was a 'traitor' 

Mr Lugovoi, a father-of-four, previously worked at the KGB as a security officer for former Russian prime minister Yegor Gaidar before becoming head of security at Russian broadcaster ORT, and later setting up his own private security company called Ninth Wave.

He first met Mr Litvinenko in 1995 when the murder victim was protecting Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky following a failed assassination attempt, the court heard.

Mr Lugovoi, who was jailed for 14 months for organising the escape of a prisoner in 2001, met Mr Litvinenko again when he travelled to London to watch CSKA Moscow play Chelsea in 2004 and on a number of further occasions in 2006, including at Mr Litvinenko's house.
