Atletico Madrid left-back Filipe Luis may have to pay cash himself to force his move to Chelsea.

The Brazilian left-back has pleaded with his club to let him leave for less than his £19million buy-out clause as Chelsea believe it is over-priced. 

Luis was outstanding 
last season and could join teammates Diego Costa and Tiago at Stamford 
Bridge.

Target: Filipe Luis impressed for Atletico this season, including in the Champions League clash with Chelsea

Chelsea also have an interest in Atletico centre-back Jaoa Miranda.

David Luiz was sold to PSG for £50m earlier this summer, so Chelsea have money to spend.

The France-bound defender will feature in Brazil's World Cup quarter-final with Colombia on Friday.
