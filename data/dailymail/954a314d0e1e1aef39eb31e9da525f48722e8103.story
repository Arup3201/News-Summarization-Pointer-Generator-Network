A dispute over the fate of a missing pig has landed one Missouri man in jail and another in the hospital with 23 stab wounds.

Joshua Finke, 22, of St. Charles, was charged Tuesday with felony assault for allegedly attacking a 38-year-old neighbor with a screwdriver.

The Lincoln County Sheriff's Department says Finke was accused by three roommates Monday night of stealing a 200-pound pig, and what started as a verbal spat between the men quickly turned physical. 

Skirmish sparked by a swine: Joshua Finke, 22, of St. Charles, was charged Tuesday with felony assault for allegedly attacking his 38-year-old roommate during an argument over the victim's missing pig 

Court documents obtained by Stltoday.com indicate that the victim and his two roommates had been fattening up the pig for seven months for slaughter in their backyard east of Highway 79 in Winfield.

Two weeks ago, the animal vanished from its pen and the pig's owners have come to suspect Finke of being the thief. 

When the roommates confronted Finke about the missing animal at around 10.30pm Monday, the 22-year-old allegedly lunged at the 38-year-old man, plunging a sharp object believed to be a screwdriver into his back 22 times and stabbing him once in the head.

The unnamed victim was rushed to a local hospital for treatment and was released Tuesday morning.

Finke is being held on $100,000 cash bond. The pig that sparked the bloody attack remains at large.
