Ten university students have died and more than 100 injured after the roof of a building collapsed in a South Korean city during a welcoming ceremony for first year students, officials said.

Emergency staff worked through the night to pull people from the rubble and rush the injured on stretchers to waiting ambulances, as snow, sleet and icy roads hampered rescue operations.

The collapse happened last night as about 560 students from Busan University of Foreign Studies had gathered for a two-day freshman orientation at the Manua Ocean Resort in the southeastern city of Gyeongju when a crack appeared in the auditorium ceiling before the collapse.

About 450 of the students had just finished dinner and were gathering for recreational activities when the roof collapsed, the official said.

Some managed to escape after noticing a crack in the roof but others couldn't leave in time.

South
 Korean media reported that heavy snowfall was believed to have resulted
 in the collapse, but the cause has not been officially announced.

Many of the students managed to get out of the building by themselves, the official said.

Jung Yoon-han, director of the disaster management department at the Ministry of Security and Public Administration, confirmed ten people died, two were seriously injured and 103 lightly injured.

Gyeongju is a historic city that served as the capital of one of the Korean Peninsula's ancient kingdoms. It is a popular tourist destination.

Located at an altitude of about 1,640ft, the resort is at the foot of Dongdae Mountain, according to the resort's website. Weather officials said the area has received heavy snow over the last week.
