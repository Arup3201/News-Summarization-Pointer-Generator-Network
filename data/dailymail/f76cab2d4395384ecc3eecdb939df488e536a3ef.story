Lizzy Yarnold claimed her second victory of the current World Cup skeleton season in Konigssee, Germany on Friday.

Yarnold completed her two runs in one minute 44.24 seconds, a comfortable 0.71 seconds ahead of second-placed German Anja Huber.

The 26-year-old Yarnold started the season with victory in Lake Placid but was forced to miss the following race in Calgary after experiencing dizzy spells.

She returned to form by taking silver last week in Altenberg behind Russia's Maria Orlova - who had to settle for bronze in Konigssee.

Yarnold said: 'I think eventually I've learned to relax on this track - it's taken me six years and I've eventually got it.'
