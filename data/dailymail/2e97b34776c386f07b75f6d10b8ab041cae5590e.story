Victim: Tim Parry, 12, was killed in the IRA bombings in Warrington, Cheshire, in 1993

The man who set up a charity project to help British terrorist victims, after his son was killed in an IRA attack in England, last night attacked David Cameron’s ‘offensive and thoughtless’ refusal to throw it a cash lifeline.

Colin Parry, whose 12-year-old son Tim was killed in the IRA bombings in Warrington in 1993, spoke out after the Prime Minister turned down a plea for £150,000 to rescue his Survivors For Peace project.

Mr Parry asked Mr Cameron and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers for the money weeks before the scheme is due to lose its Lottery funding in April.

But he said he was shocked by a letter from Number 10 advising him to use the internet to find the money.

‘It is offensive for Mr Cameron to suggest that after nearly 20 years of running a charity I don’t know where to get money,’ said Mr Parry.

‘I do know and I have been to them all. His thoughtless response suggests he doesn’t see us as a priority. He expects us to muddle through, but we can’t.

‘Unless we find a wealthy benefactor we will have to make our staff redundant and cut adrift all the people who depend on us for support.’

Mr Parry said the Government’s refusal was ‘short-sighted’, adding: ‘Sadly, there are likely to be future British victims of terrorist attacks, here or abroad, and we are here to help survivors. If we aren’t, it will be harder for them.’

Tim Parry and another child, three-year-old Johnathan Ball, were killed in the IRA’s attack on Warrington, Cheshire, in 1993. Their deaths touched the heart of the nation and Colin Parry received an OBE for peace campaigning after the atrocity.

Criticism: Following his son's death, Colin Parry set up a charity project to help British terrorist victims. Last night, he attacked David Cameron's 'offensive and thoughtless' refusal to throw the charity a cash lifeline

He and wife Wendy set up the Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation For Peace and later devised the Survivors For Peace programme, set up to help British victims of the Northern Ireland ‘Troubles’.

The scheme has since been widened to include those affected by the 9/11 attack in New York, the 7/7 bombings in London and the killing of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich.

‘My wife and I know from experience that friends and family can do so much, but you need experienced help to get through losing a loved one in a terrorist incident,’ said Mr Parry.

‘That is why we established this charity. It is the only one that  specifically offers help to British terrorist victims.

‘We organised last year’s Hyde Park commemoration of the 7/7 bombing and plan to do the same this year. Victims get together, remember their loss in a dignified way and share their experiences. Without us, who will do it in future?’

In his letter, Mr Cameron said the Government had ‘done much in recent years to meet these needs’.

He urged Mr Parry to use the internet to search for new sources of charitable cash, adding: ‘I encourage the Foundation to explore those tools.’

Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Ivan Lewis said: ‘It is essential to ensure victims of terrorism get  all the support they need to rebuild their lives. David Cameron and Theresa Villiers must stop dithering and save this project.’

The Warrington bombings consisted of two attacks – one at a gas storage facility and one in the town centre, where two bombs caused carnage and confusion.

Johnathan was killed almost instantly and Tim was so badly injured his parents had to take the agonising decision to turn off his  life support machine. More than 50 others were injured.

Downing Street did not comment last night.
