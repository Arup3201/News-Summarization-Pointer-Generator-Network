Oblivious to passers-by, lost in their own amorous bubble, the pair gaze into each others’ eyes and then move in for a kiss. She slips her hand round his waist and he clasps the world’s best known behind...

On the evidence of this very public display of affection on a London street after they had played tennis at the weekend, Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson simply can’t keep their hands off each other.

So, just who is the beau with the bright blue eyes? Well, it seems Her Royal Hotness has finally landed a man who might just prove to be a keeper.

Smooch: The couple kiss passionately in London's summer sun before going their separate ways

Nico Jackson, a 35-year-old grammar-school educated stockbroker working in the London office of Deutsche Bank, is tall, handsome, sporty and solvent.

And while most Englishmen cringe at the thought of a public hug — Alex Loudon, Pippa’s most recent significant ex, was said to be miserable in the spotlight and certainly always looked it — Nico appears not to care who sees him kissing Pippa.

Indeed, he seems to revel in walking around arm in arm with her, or even hand in hand, suggesting he is both very keen on her and cheerfully unbothered by publicity.

Perfect match: Pippa with Jackson after a game of tennis

The fact that he’s not titled or aristocratic has surprised some, given Pippa’s previous boyfriends have had rather grand connections.

Some observers maintained that the 29-year-old — whose Edinburgh university friends were known as the ‘Castle Crew’ because their families all owned one — was after a big country house and a title to compete with her sister.

After all, she did share a flat at 
university with two Dukes’ sons: George Percy, heir to the Duke of 
Northumberland, and Edward Innes-Ker, son of the Duke of Roxburghe.

And recently there was Vicomte Arthur de Soultrait, the clothing entrepreneur for whose party she dressed as a saucy Marie Antoinette and was photographed the next day in a car in which a friend of the Vicomte was brandishing a gun (fake, as it turned out).

But her relationship with Nico certainly seems to be serious.

Nico was born to retailer Martyn Jackson and his second wife, Austrian-born Ulrike, a former au pair for whom Jackson, 64, had left his first wife Antoinette.

Ulrike, known as ‘Ulli’, has declared herself to be ‘very pleased’ with the relationship between her son and Pippa, describing it as ‘perfect’.

Ulli and Martyn run a fashion and sportswear shop, called Landau, in Folkestone, Kent, and live nearby in a mock Georgian terrace where Nico was raised with his sister Nina.

Landau sells high-end skiwear and Ugg boots, among other things — the whole Jackson family, like the Middletons, are mad about skiing.

Nico went to a local Catholic primary school and then the selective Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone.

He played football, cricket and tennis for the school and then read business at Kingston University, winning a place on the advertising agency M&C Saatchi’s graduate trainee scheme before moving into banking.

One fellow financier says: ‘Nico is funny, sharp, oozes charm and never loses his cool. I think he’s very ambitious but he wears it lightly.'

Nico has made money at Deutsche Bank. Last summer he sold a flat in London’s leafy, white stucco South Kensington square for £1.56 million.

Before that, he lived in the Sloane stomping ground of Parson’s Green in West London.

Nico has already been to Mustique with the Middletons and Kate and William — surely the ultimate sign of approval.

They flew from Mustique to Zermatt in Switzerland, where they were seen ‘aggressively snogging’ in a bar, according to an onlooker. Then, in March, there was more very public smooching in St Moritz at a ski marathon in which both competed.

And at 35, Nico is the age at which even bachelor bankers start to think about marriage . . .
