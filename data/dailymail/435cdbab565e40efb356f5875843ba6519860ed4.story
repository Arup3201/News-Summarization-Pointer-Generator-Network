New fathers could take up to six months of paid leave from work under controversial plans  at the heart of the Queen’s Speech yesterday.

Ministers said proposals were chiefly designed to make Britain more business-friendly and boost the economy, with measures to rein in a £1billion-a-year employment tribunal bonanza, reform the banking sector and lift red tape on firms.

But legislation to revolutionise the workplace by introducing flexible parental leave by 2015 dismayed some business leaders, who said it would be a ‘nightmare’ to administer.

Power of paternity: New fathers could take up to six months of paid leave from work under controversial plans at the heart of the Queen's Speech yesterday

Queen Elizabeth announced yesterday that new fathers could take up to six months of paid leave from work under controversial plans

Critics said the Coalition’s programme, details of which were delivered by the Queen in little more than eight minutes, was not radical enough given the economic emergency facing Britain following the economy’s slump into a double-dip recession.

The Confederation of British Industry said the ‘jury was out’ on the Government’s flagship proposals to repeal unnecessary regulation on business and limit state inspections of firms.

Other key measures included:

■
A new flat-rate state pension, to be worth £155 a week, to be 
introduced in the most far-reaching reform of the system for a century

■ Forcing banks to ring-fence risky investment activities from their retail arms

■ New powers for company shareholders to rein in fat cat pay

■ Rights for fathers to maintain ‘meaningful’ relationships with children after a separation and moves to speed up adoption

■ A new offence of drug driving and a National Crime Agency to tackle organised crime and border security

The plans threatened to be 
overshadowed, however, by a row over House of Lords reform, which was 
included in the programme but is fiercely opposed by many Conservative 
MPs.

The Prime Minister told the Daily 
Mail that he was determined the Government would not get ‘bogged down’ 
in the issue and suggested a referendum might be held if MPs determine 
one is necessary.

David
Cameron sought to calm his Right-wing MPs – who agreed in a private 
meeting of the backbench 1922 committee last night that criticism of the
party leadership had gone too far and should be tempered – by shelving 
plans on overseas aid and gay marriage.

Should fathers have the right to six months' paternity leave?

But
proposals for flexible parental leave, championed by Deputy Prime 
Minister Nick Clegg, were included, despite business warnings that it 
will be a bureaucratic disaster if mothers and fathers are able to take 
their leave in ‘chunks’ of a few weeks or months at a time.

The
legislation is designed to smash the traditional assumption that it is 
the mother who should take time off work to care for a new child.

Ministers say the measures will offer
more flexibility to modern families where women are as likely as men to
be the main breadwinner, and allow fathers to spend more time with 
their children.

Under existing rules, mothers are 
entitled to take 12 months maternity leave, of which nine months is 
paid. Fathers can take two weeks paid paternity leave.

A consultation launched by ministers 
last year proposed that mothers will automatically have five months paid
maternity leave, along with six weeks paid paternity leave for their 
partners.

The couple 
will then be allowed to divide up a further seven months of parental 
leave between them. All but the last three months will be paid at the 
statutory minimum of £128.73.

This
means that in cases where the mother chooses to go back to work after 
five months, the father could take up to eight-and-a-half months off – 
six months of which would be paid.

Alternatively,
new parents could opt to take more than six months off at the same time
– doubling the disruption in cases where a firm employs them both.

Employers
will be forced to keep their jobs open and would not be able to refuse 
requests for the time off. The extra four weeks paternity leave would be
given to men who would be urged to ‘use it or lose it’.

Business Secretary Vince Cable is expected to give the Government’s formal response to the consultation next month.
