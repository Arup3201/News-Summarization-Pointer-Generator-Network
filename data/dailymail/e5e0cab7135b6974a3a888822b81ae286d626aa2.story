Martin Hunt, 24, was jailed for 12 years after he filmed himself abusing a baby girl

A paedophile who filmed himself sexually abusing a baby girl was caught after new owners of his home found child pornography he left behind during the move.

The new owners of his home were quick to tip off police when they re-decorated the home and found a disc hidden behind kitchen units at the Frinton, Essex, property.

Martin Hunt, 24, was eventually tracked down when police happened to find indecent images at another paedophile's house in Kent and a trail of emails linking Hunt to the abuse.

Judge Patricia Lynch QC jailed Hunt for 12 years and gave him an extended licence of eight years when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex. This means he could be recalled to prison if he offends again within 20 years of his release.

He will serve at least nine years in prison before he is considered for parole.

Judge Lynch described the abuse as appalling and horrendous.

She said: 'You are a danger to young children. I hope this child never knows what happened to her.'

The judge praised Detective Sergeant Katie Mead and the investigation for their efforts to track Hunt down.

She said: 'I am impressed by their tenacious approach in this case. If it had not been for that, this man may never have been caught.

'The officer in the case and others involved should be commended.'

Hunt was caught after police arrested a man in Kent in December, 2013, on suspicion of sexually abusing two young girls.

Officers found an email from Hunt in which he admitted sexually abusing a girl of whom he had sent pictures.

Police then arrested Hunt on February 7.

During the sentencing at Chelmsford Crown Court (pictured), the court heard how Hunt was found with items in his possession which had appeared in the child pornography recording

They found indecent photographs on a memory card, a camera and an iPhone.

Prosecutor Diane Pigot said: 'Among his possessions were a T-shirt and gold chains he was wearing in the images. There was clearly evidence of sharing of indecent images.'

Ms Pigot said the owners of Hunt's former house found a disc containing indecent images during redecorating works.

Hunt admitted 19 charges, including sexual assault and making, distributing and possessing indecent images.
