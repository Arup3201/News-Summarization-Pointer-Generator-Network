Jailed: Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been given a life sentence for murdering an Afghan insurgent in Helmand province

A Royal Marine who murdered an insurgent in Afghanistan said last night he was devastated over the decision to jail him for life.

Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, was told he would serve at least ten years for murdering the Afghan national in Helmand province in 2011. He has also been dismissed from the Marines in disgrace.

But yesterday his commanding officer pledged his ‘full support’ for his comrade, saying Blackman had been ‘tainted’ by experiences described as ‘hell on earth’.

Last night a huge wave of support was
 swelling for the first British serviceman to be convicted of murder on 
active service abroad since the Second World War.

One
 Facebook group has nearly 30,000 supporters and is calling for Blackman
 to be released. Another group has more than 10,000 followers.

In court, Blackman stood tall in his dress uniform and saluted for one last time as Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett passed judgment. His face impassive, he turned sharply to his left and marched out of the court.

The 6ft 3in commando was told by the country’s most senior military judge that his ‘brutal and savage’ crime had ‘betrayed’ Britain’s armed forces and ‘tarnished their reputation’. And he had ‘put at risk’ the lives of other UK troops and civilians by increasing the likelihood that Islamic extremists would carry out revenge attacks.

In a withering sentencing statement, Judge Blackett said: ‘You have provided ammunition to the terrorists whose propaganda portrays the British presence in Afghanistan as part of a war on Islam in which civilians are arbitrarily killed.

‘Committing this sort of act could well provoke the enemy to act more brutally towards British troops in retribution or reprisal.’

But in a letter read to the court, Lieutenant Colonel Simon Chapman, commanding officer of 42 Commando, said Blackman had faced ‘incomprehensible pressures with great fortitude and dignity’.

Lt Col Chapman said a ‘momentary and fatal lapse of judgment’ had ‘altered his life immeasurably’.

He added: ‘He had so much to behold – a proud career and a promising future. Sadly, this is no longer the case. He is not a bad man. In almost every respect, he is a normal citizen tainted only by the impact of war.’

In a statement read outside the court martial, Blackman, of Taunton, Somerset, said he was ‘devastated’.

‘Sgt Blackman and his wife are devastated by the life sentence imposed upon him together with the order that he serve a minimum of ten years before he is eligible for parole,’ said his lawyer.

‘Furthermore, he has been dismissed 
with disgrace from the Royal Marines, with whom he has served proudly 
for 15 years. He is very sorry for any damage caused to the Royal 
Marines.’

The experienced commando thanked the public ‘for the support shown to him and his wife’. He is appealing the sentence.

The
 court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, heard Blackman was suffering from 
combat stress when he murdered the Taliban captive and was trying to 
deal with the grief of his father’s death months earlier.

He lost his cool near the end of a ‘tour from hell’, during which 23 servicemen from 3 Commando Brigade lost their lives and insurgents hung the limbs of maimed British troops in trees as ‘trophies’.

Film: The Marine could be heard quoting Shakespeare as he shot the Taliban prisoner

His badly injured victim had been 
found with an AK47 assault rifle and grenade after an Apache helicopter 
blitzed him with cannon fire following an attack on a British base.

Blackman
 shot the injured insurgent in the chest at close range with a 9mm 
pistol in Afghanistan, then taunted him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, 
you c***.’ It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’

Blackman, who served with 42 Commando, then told his comrades: ‘I just broke the Geneva Convention.’

Harrowing
 film and audio recordings of the ‘field execution’ in a cornfield, 
captured on a helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade, were played to 
the trial.

'Devastated': The Marine and his wife spoke of their anguish at the heavy sentence

The 
commando, who completed six gruelling tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and 
Northern Ireland during 15 years with the Marines, was convicted of 
slaying the insurgent on September 15, 2011. He denied murder, claiming 
he thought the insurgent was already dead.

Sentencing
 Blackman, Judge Blackett said: ‘You treated that Afghan man with 
contempt and murdered him in cold blood. You have betrayed your corps 
and all British service personnel who have served in Afghanistan, and 
you have tarnished their reputation.

‘You
 were obliged to care for him but instead you executed him.’ Anthony 
Berry QC, defending Blackman, said the commando had been deployed in 
‘hell on earth’.

The Marines knew that if they were captured they would meet a grisly fate – ‘skinned alive and beheaded’.

Mr Berry said that during the six-month tour, Blackman was suffering from ‘poor sleep, fatigue, the grief that resulted from the death of his father, and feelings, though unspoken, of paranoia that he was going to be shot at every time he stepped out on patrol’.

Supporters of Sergeant Alexander Blackman took to Facebook and Twitter yesterday to protest against his ten-year prison sentence. The thousands of comments posted on the websites included:

Terry Wright: ‘Ten years’ imprisonment for killing a member of the Taliban, yet killing Bin Laden in his bedroom was fine. He is still a human being, what’s the difference? Of course, silly old me, forgot the governments of this world can do what they please!’

oilywater@rumandcoffee: ‘So Marine A goes down for life, 10 years min. That’s going to inflict more damage to the Marines than the Taliban ever could.’

Jeanette Carter: ‘It’s a war! Who could blame him for shooting that guy after  witnessing his comrades’ legs hanging in the trees. I think the Taliban b*****d was very lucky to be granted a quick end to his miserable life!’ 

Messages of support: Many people took to Twitter to express their outrage at the sentence

Penny Johnson: ‘What is the world coming to. We need a government who will stand up for British people.’

Shannon Cross: ‘Absolutely ridiculous! That Taliban member would have shot first if he wasn’t injured! I wonder how many people he had already killed!’

Florence Green: ‘So angry, this brave man should NEVER have been charged. Should have been given a medal. Talk about lions led by donkeys!’

Paul Manning: ‘Locking him up is a disgrace. How many innocent people did the swine he killed kill? All he has done is left us with one less terrorist. Guy deserves a medal, not a jail sentence!’ 

Many expressed shocked at the length of the sentence handed to Sergeant Alexander Blackman

Former Lance Corporal Matt Croucher, the most highly decorated Marine to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the sentence was unfair.

‘I find it quite morally baffling that he could get a ten-year sentence when someone like Baby P’s mother only served a few years,’ he said.

‘If you put these people next to each other, the moral gap is huge. He has been given a longer sentence than some rapists and child molesters.

‘People think he murdered someone in cold blood. But that person was a terrorist insurgent intent on killing British personnel and maiming them and, given half a chance, would do the same thing here.’
