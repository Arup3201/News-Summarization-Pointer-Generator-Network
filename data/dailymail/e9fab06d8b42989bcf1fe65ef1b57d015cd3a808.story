Peering out from behind a blue and white bra, these adorable dark corgi puppies look like they don't have a care in the world. But they do have a serious purpose.

The mini corgis, along with a cute pair of tiny black cavapoos, are the stars of Cosmopolitan's new breast cancer awareness campaign, launched in association with charity CoppaFeel!

'The idea is these guys are puppies and you guys have puppies,' explains CoppaFeel! founder and breast cancer survivor, Kristin Hallenga. 'A different kind of puppies - boobies - so what better way to be reminded to check your boobs than with these cute guys?'

Although breast cancer is more common in older women, the campaign is targeting those between 18 and 35, who are less likely to check their breasts regularly.

Last year there were 541 cases in this age group but despite this many are still more likely to get their eyes tested than check their breasts for lumps.

Hallenga, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at 23 says: 'Women stand a one in eight chance of getting breast cancer at some point in their lives.

'Getting women to regularly check their breasts therefore has to become a ritual and needs to be on people’s minds all year round.

'The more we remind people, the more we hope it’ll become a habit. Hence #CheckYourPuppies was born.'

At the beginning of every month, a new puppy picture will appear on CoppaFeel!'s free app to remind users to check their breasts.The image will also appear on Cosmopolitan's website and social media channels.

Cute! The images are part of the #Checkyourpuppies campaign launched by Cosmopolitan and CoppaFeel!

'It’s almost six months since Breast Awareness month,' said Louise Court, Editor of Cosmopolitan.

'With over a third of women admitting
they never check their breasts, it’s essential that boob checking 
remains at the top of women’s agendas.

'Early detection saves lives, so we’re
urging women to help us spread the "Check Your Puppies" message by 
sharing our pictures as widely as they can.' 

CoppaFeel! has also launched a campaign video starring Fearne Cotton, who urges viewers to get their breasts checked.

Other celebrity supporters include Dermot O'Leary and singer, Olly Murs.

The Cosmopolitan campaign, which launches today, also includes an adorable behind-the-scenes video of the puppies playing with the bras.

The #CheckYourPuppies campaign launches in the April issue of Cosmopolitan, on sale now. Find out more at cosmopolitan.co.uk/checkyourpuppies and at coppafeel.org
