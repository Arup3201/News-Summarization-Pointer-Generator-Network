Scientists have been left marveling at an astronomical 'Freaky Friday' when an asteroid the size of the White House made a record close pass by earth on the same day a meteor exploded over a Russian town - a dual event they say had a 100 million to 1 chance of taking place at the same time.

The chance occurrence puts into perspective how little we know or can predict about the universe around us and dwarfs the often cited 1 in 10,000 odds we could be hit by a large asteroid some time in the next 100 years.

As astronomers excitedly prepared for the White House sized asteroid DA14 to travel a record close distance to Earth three days ago - something that only occurs every 20 to 40 years - other more unexpected reports flooded-in from Russia.

'Coincidence': Nasa model of the asteroid 2012 DA14 passing at a record close level to earth. It passed by safely on Friday - the same day a meteor blasted over Russia

Aftermath: Russia was clearing up after a record meteor blast on Friday. More than 1000 were injured but no one was killed in the explosion

A large meteor exploded over the town Chelyabinsk causing $33million worth of damage shattering 4,000 windows, collapsing roofs and injuring 1,200 at 9.30am local time on Friday.

Prior to entering the earth's surface it was estimated to be 55 feet and weighing 10,000 tons, it was the largest meteor to hit earth since 1908 and entered the earth's surface at 40,000 mph.

The rare event came hours before the DA14 asteroid passed at the speed of a bullet at a record close distance to earth.

Nasa were able to reliably predict 
DA14's distance from earth and predicted that 2046 it will make another 
close call but have no impact..

But it is just one asteroid being 
monitored by Nasa's Near-Earth Object project founded in 1998 to monitor
worrying asteroid trajectories which they themselves admit is no 
precise science.

One asteroid, 2011 AG5, which was 
given a 625 - 1 likelihood of hitting the earth in 2040 according to 
models published in February last year is now predicted to have 'near to
no chance' of hitting earth - something which is reassuring but only 
when the models work that way around.

Found: Russian scientists have retrieved fragments of the meteor from a frozen lake

Shockwave: People heading to work in Chelyabinsk, Russia, heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them

In addition the space agency says 
there are 1,379 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids which could collide with
earth and believe they have only located around 90 per cent of such 
bodies.

However, impact doesn't necessarily mean the levels of devastation seen in Hollywood films.

In 1908 the last largest impact in recent history wiped out vast areas ofÂ  forest land in Siberia but only killed one man.

Russia has now begun clearing up the impact of Friday's meteor blast.

Scientists announced today they had found fragments of the meteor and would be studying them.

They admitted they had no idea of the meteor's path and could only watch its devastation.

'It was impossible for us to track the [Chelyabinsk] meteor in advance,' Vladimir Lipunov, head of the Space Monitoring 
Laboratory with Moscow State University told the LA Times. 'If the 
meteor had fallen or exploded low [in the sky] above one of the numerous
military or nuclear facilities near Chelyabinsk, the consequences would
have been far more catastrophic.'

Nasa put out a statement explaining Friday's events were not connected.

'According to NASA scientists, the 
trajectory of the Russia meteor was significantly different than the 
trajectory of the asteroid 2012 DA14, making it a completely unrelated 
object,' the statement said.

'Information is still being collected
about the Russia meteor and analysis is preliminary at this point. In 
videos of the meteor, it is seen to pass from left to right in front of 
the rising sun, which means it was traveling from north to south. 
Asteroid DA14's trajectory is in the opposite direction, from south to 
north.

'We would expect an event of this 
magnitude to occur once every 100 years on average,' said Paul Chodas of
NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, California said of the meteor.

Chairwoman of the department of 
physics at Yale University, Meg Urry, said the events have intrigued the
world of astronomy but they were, indeed, a coincidence.

' Friday was an extremely unusual day, astronomically speaking,' she wrote on CNN.com today.

'Both events happening within one day
makes us think they could be connected. But the facts don't support 
this conclusion. First of all, in the time between the two events, the 
Earth moved roughly 300,000 miles, meaning the asteroid and the meteor 
were in completely different places. Moreover, they traveled in 
completely different directions, so they couldn't have been associated.

'So there is no way the meteor and 
the asteroid are connected. It has to be a coincidence that the two 
events happened on the same day.

'If asteroids as big as DA14 pass 
close to Earth once every decade or two, and meteors as large as the 
Chelyabinsk one impact once every 100 years (a similar meteor having 
caused the Tunguska event in 1908), the chance of both events happening 
on any one day are indeed very small: 1 in 3,650 days times 1 in 36,500 
days, or about 1 in 100 million -- not odds you would bet against.'
