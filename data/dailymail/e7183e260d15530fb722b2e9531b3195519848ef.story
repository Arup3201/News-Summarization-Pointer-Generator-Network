A man has opened up about what happened when he discovered his identity had been stolen online and used to contact dozens of women.

At first, Jon Will Chambers, a freelance creative designer from Norwich, didn't think much of it when a stranger e-mailed him to say she had been speaking to a man online who was using his pictures under a different name.

But it soon became clear that the problem went way deeper than just the one instance.

Jon Will Chambers, 22, has opened up about how an online impostor used his personal photos to talk to at least 20 girls and women over a period of five  years

In fact, Jon discovered that at least 20 women and teenage girls had been tricked into communicating with the man, who used the fake name 'David Jones,' (not name actually used on the sites) with a number of them led to believe they were in a romantic relationship with him.

'David' was using recent pictures from Jon's Facebook page as well as old ones from his deleted MySpace account in order to assume his identity and over a period of four to five years, he had sent thousands of emails using Jon's pictures. 

He contacted women through dating sites, social media platforms and teenage forums, using several different email addresses and charming them with poetry and his supposed love of music.

Even after Jon confronted them, some of the women didn't understand that he and 'David' were not the same person.

Speaking to MailOnline, Jon said: 'Some of the girls had been speaking to him for five years and thought they were in a relationship with "me".

'That's when things started to get creepy and strange but above all worrying as it was clear he was spending a lot of time talking to young girls using my identity.' 

He tried contacting the police, but to no avail - they told him there is no law preventing people from taking his online pictures, since he had them on a public setting

Eventually, one of the women hacked into 'David's' account and discovered his true identity - a 65-year-old married man from the UK living in Spain. 

After Jon tracked him down online, 'David' apologised, describing himself as 'just a sad lonely man' and claiming that he was mentally unwell. 

Still, Jon felt that justice needed to be served - not just for him, but for the dozens of girls and women 'David' had duped.

So he tried contacting the police, but to no avail. 

He was sent to Action Fraud, which deals with internet crime, but they told him there was not much they could do about it.

Their advice was to edit his privacy settings or take down his accounts altogether, but Jon didn't want to give  his impostor that satisfaction.

He said: 'They told me to just make my profiles private - that's not a response, that's just sticking your head in the sand and pretending it won't happen to the next person. 

'I'm not going to miss out on meeting new people, getting new business or being myself by not embracing social media or the 21st century.'

Despite the incident, Jon has decided not to let it affect his online life. He said: 'I don't think you can live your life in fear of people doing bad things' 

Instead, he believes it's time law was updated in order to protect internet users from this kind of criminal behaviour. 

'There was a clear and obvious pattern of grooming where he would take them from a public forum, to a private email, to speaking on Skype or on the phone,' he said. 

'That's the most creepy thing and worrying behaviour about this - and the police still weren't interested despite all the evidence. 

'I was worried that if this was just the tip of the iceberg - who was this man? What would he do if I told the police? 

'Also, what would the family of these girls think of "me" despite the fact it wasn't me doing all this - it was someone using my face.'

Jon has spent the last few months attempting to get all 15 of 'David's' fake social media profiles taken down, an arduous process that has yet to be completed.

When Jon's imposter was finally tracked down, he was revealed to be a pensioner in Spain (Picture posed by model) 

One social media site told him that his impostor didn’t break their 'community usage policy', while another never replied to his emails.

Despite the fact that some of the fake accounts are still up to this day, Jon has decided not to let it affect his online life.

He said: 'I've met some of my closest friends online as well as an ex-boyfriend too. 

'I don't think you can live your life in fear of people doing bad things.'
