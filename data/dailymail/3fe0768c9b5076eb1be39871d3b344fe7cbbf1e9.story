The Royal College of Nursing's Peter Carter said figures showing 5,778 nurses were recruited from abroad in the year up to September 2013 showed an 'astonishing over-reliance' on foreign staff

Almost 6,000 new NHS nurses were recruited from abroad last year, many from Spain and Portugal.

The huge influx – a four-fold rise on the previous 12 months – has sparked fears that some nurses will lack the English language skills to do their jobs properly.

Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the figures showed an ‘astonishing over-reliance’ on foreign staff. He added: ‘The last few years have seen real panic-buying of nurses from wherever they can be found, to keep care safe.’

Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ‘We are concerned that poor English skills may lead to mistakes and misunderstandings when patients are trying to explain their problems.’

An investigation by the Mail last month found that nurses picked up at recruitment fairs in Portugal struggled to fill out basic forms and needed a translation service.

The latest figures, according to research by the Health Service Journal, show that in the 12 months to September 2013, 5,778 nurses were recruited from abroad compared with 1,360 the previous year.

The staffing crisis has come about partly because the Government slashed the numbers of training posts.

Demand also intensified following the damning report into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire, where many wards were dangerously understaffed.

Hospital chiefs are flying to Spain and Portugal to find recruits because the recession there has led to high unemployment.

A loophole in EU legislation prevents the Nursing and Midwifery Council from checking the English of European nurses before they are registered for NHS work.

Hospitals must carry out their own tests but there is a suspicion that some turn a blind eye to poor results.

Mrs Murphy said: ‘We hear from patients on our helpline there are real issues with nurses from other countries, including problems with communication and a lack of understanding of processes and procedures. We must ensure they are fully qualified and competent to carry out their duties and that they are competent enough in English to effectively communicate with patients.’ 

Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: ‘All these nurses may be excellent, but there are real concerns about the language barrier. It just shows how disorganised the NHS is – why aren’t we training more of our own?’

The Health Service Journal figures show that 1,925 nurses came from Spain and 1,240 from Portugal. Kings College Hospital in London (pictured) recruited the most, 276

The Mail investigation involved a recruitment fair held in a hotel in Porto and hosted by Bedford Hospital to hire 25 nurses.

Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said millions was being wasted on overseas recruitment

Managers failed to carry out rigorous written tests on candidates’ English, and offered help with completing the application forms using an automatic translation website. 

Some candidates, who admitted their English was not very good, were told this would not matter because patients and hospital staff would speak slowly. 

Professor Jane Ball, a health affairs academic at Southampton University, said recruitment fairs were ‘a short-term and inefficient stop gap’.

Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘The Government should be bringing on the next generation of nurses, but ministers are cutting training places at home and wasting millions on overseas recruitment.’

A Department of Health spokesman said an extra 1,000 adult nursing training places had been added this year, but acknowledged that foreign nurses had always been an important part of the NHS.

He added: ‘Individual trusts are responsible for planning and recruiting their workforce.’

The Health Service Journal figures show that 1,925 nurses came from Spain and 1,240 from Portugal. Kings College Hospital in London recruited the most, 276.

Overseas nurses now make up 13 per cent of the 686,240 who are registered to work in the UK.

Dr Carter said: ‘Overseas nurses have always made a valuable contribution to the NHS, but these figures show an astonishing over-reliance.’ 

 

A spokesman for Bedford Hospital NHS Trust said:

‘Like many trusts, difficulties in recruiting locally and nationally meant it undertook additional overseas recruitment.

The interview panel in Portugal included senior nurses from the Trust and the process included written tests followed by rigorous interviews in English, testing listening skills and reasoning applied to nursing practice, including drug calculations. The applicants are also asked to write a care plan. Trust staff did not help applicants complete their forms and it is not willing to employ nurses who have a limited command of English. A number of nurses were not offered contracts for this reason.’

 In common with most other national newspapers, on December 17 and 18 we reported analysis by the Health Service Journal which stated that, due to an NHS nursing shortage, 5,788 out of 7,111 nurses recruited in the last 12 months were foreign. In fact, while the 5,788 figure was correct, the 7,111 figure related to the net change in the number of full-time equivalent nurses over a six-month period only. The Health Service Journal and the Health & Social Care Information Centre have asked us to make clear that the statistics were not therefore comparable. HSCIC's analysis shows that, in the 12 months to September 2014, 7,449 out of 33,838 joiners - including health visitors, midwives and nurses - were non-British.
