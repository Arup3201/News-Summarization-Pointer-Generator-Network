The family of a Texas university student shot dead by a campus cop on Friday have said they do not believe the account given by the officer responsible for his death.

Captain Chris Carter claimed he shot Robert Cameron Redus after the 23-year-old beat him with his own baton after being stopped for driving erratically.

But the family of the 23-year-old, known as Cameron, say he was never aggressive or confrontational.

Grief: Valerie Redus is hugged by family friend Emily Vaughan at a vigil for her son Cameron

Doubts: Mickey Redus, pictured at his son's vigil, says he has doubts about the police account of the shooting

'Our family does not believe the 
officer’s report ... For him to confront a police officer would be completely out of his character', parents Mickey and Valerie Redus said yesterday.

In the statement, reported in KVUE, the family said: 'We are grieved by the tragic and unnecessary death of our son Cameron.'

The Incarnate Word student was in his final year at the San Antonio university and had been celebrating the end of the fall semester with friends when he was shot outside his apartment.

Friends and professors of Cameron told his parents 'just how much they admired and respected Cameron and expected him to be a success in life'.

Mr and Mrs Redus added: 'We expect all official reports to confirm that Cameron’s death was unnecessary and unjustified.'

The family said they knew their son would have been unarmed and added that the police had searched his apartment and cleaned up the scene before they arrived.

Investigation: Police say Cameron Redus, 23, was charging at a campus police officer when he was shot

Scuffle: Witnesses heard a short exchange between Cameron and the officer before shots were fired

Police have started an investigation into the shooting but Cameron's family said they questioned the campus officer's decision to follow an unknown person to an off-campus apartment.

'Even if Cameron was driving erratically,
he presented no threat to the campus police officer or anyone else once
he parked his truck,' they said in the statement.

In a press conference on Monday, Chief Richard Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department said Cameron had wrestled Captain Carter's baton from him and hit the policeman in the head and arm with it.

Captain Carter eventually got the baton back and told Cameron four times to stop fighting him or he would shoot.

That's when the student allegedly turned around and charged at Captain Carter with his arm raised to strike, and Captain Carter fired six shots, hitting Cameron five times in the chest, neck, eye, arm and thigh.

While the camera on the police cruiser 
was out, audio was still working which captured Captain Carter warning the student 56 
times to stop resisting arrest, 14 times to place his hands behind his back and three times that he was under arrest, the police claimed.

Alamo Heights Police Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt told KSAT
that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Treehouse apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where
Cameron was a resident.

It
is not clear where Captain Carter first tried to pull Cameron over, but both 
vehicles pulled into the parking lot 
of the Treehouse Apartments where the struggle ensued. Lieutenant Pruitt told My San Antonio that Captain Carter radioed for help shortly before Cameron was shot.

Not aggressive: Cameron Redus' friends and family can't understand how someone as gentle and kind as him could have been shot by a police officer

A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings.

'I
didn't hear him say anything like, "Get down on your hands and knees," 
you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the
man told KSAT.

'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.'

Mohammad Haidarasl lived directly below Cameron at the Treehouse Apartments.

He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between the student and Captain Carter.

'I heard [a man] say, "Oh, you're gonna shoot me?" like sarcastic almost,' he said.

Less
than a minute later, Mr Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only 
realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom Mr Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.'

The officer, who has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the shooting investigation, has an 'extensive law enforcement background' according to the university.

However, part of the background involves jumping from job-to-job on a regular basis, according to employment records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News.

Devastated: One of Cameron's brothers, and his father Mickey, at the vigil

Memories: The ceremony included many remembrances from friends in the UIW community. A candlelight vigil was also held on campus at the Lourdes Grotto. Redus' brother and mother can be seen on the right of the picture

A vigil was held inside the Academic Convocation Center. Many in attendance either wore green clothing or a green ribbon as it was his favorite color. Redus' brother is seen here

'He was just not that type of person,' Cameron's friend, 20-year-old Miriam Thomas, told My San Antonio. 'Everyone has been completely heartbroken over this.'

More than 200 people - including the student's 
mother and father - attended a vigil on Sunday to mourn the UIW student 
and remember his short life.

Captain Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career.

He
rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and 
seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his 
career.

KVUE-TV reports that Captain Carter has told investigators he feared for his life.

Kyle Leihsing, a San Antonio native had been friends with Cameron for three years.

'He was one of the most level-headed people I've ever met. What I have heard is completely counter-intuitive to what I have known him to be,' he said.

'There's just an outpouring of genuine grief among hundreds, if not thousands, of people in our community because he was so well-liked and loved,' Annie Jones, another friend, told KENS 5.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident,' UIW President Dr Lou Agnese said.

Moving on: Cameron was due to graduate from the University of the Incarnate Word in May

Old high school friends were also shocked to hear about the shooting.

'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.'

Cameron had moved to San Antonio from
Baytown for school. He went to Baytown Christian Academy and graduated 
as co-valedictorian.

His academic success continued at 
UIW, where he had been named to the Dean's List and was a part-time 
anchor for the school's student newscast.

'I
grieve on behalf of his parents, because I know how devastated they 
are. He was a sweet, sweet person,' said family friend Annie Jones.
