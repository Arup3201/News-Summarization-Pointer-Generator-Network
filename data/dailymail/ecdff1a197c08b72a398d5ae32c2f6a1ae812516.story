Low-cost airlines easyJet, Ryanair and Aer Lingus received the fewest complaints to UK air regulators last year.

The Civil Aviation Authority reported that per million fliers, easyJet received just 33 complaints and Ryanair 35, while just 29 complaints were made about Irish airline Aer Lingus. 

In the recent years, cancellations, missing bags and denied boarding featured high on the list of gripes which lead to customers of budget airlines making complaints.

Between 2005 and 2010, Ryanair complaints rose by 70 per cent  and easyJet's by a third over the same period, according to the Air Transport Users' Council (AUC).

High costs for checked in baggage, long queues and poor service have often wrangled with travellers flying on low-cost airlines, but it seems we're now happier to fly cheaply and cheerfully. 

Bob Atkinson of TravelSupermarket.com said: 'It's fantastic to see that three of the cheapest airlines have some of the lowest complaints.' 

Meanwhile, package holiday specialists Thomas Cook and Thomson did not rate so highly, both receiving record high numbers of gripes.

In 2013, the CAA received 229,778 complaints about flights from the UK in total.

It also reports that 84 per cent of scheduled flights into the UK landed on time this year.

And the five other airports monitored, Manchester, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Glasgow and Newcastle, have seen an overall increase of six percentage points, from 81 per cent  to 87 per cent of flights on-time.
