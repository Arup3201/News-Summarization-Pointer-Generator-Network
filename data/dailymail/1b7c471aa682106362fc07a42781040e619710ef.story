A disabled pensioner has hit out at British Gas after the energy giant phoned him, visited him and sent him bills for 14 years - even though he doesn't use any gas.

Stroke victim Alan Eacock, 73, says the firm repeatedly pestered him over a gas meter he does not use - and has now had removed -  leaving him suffering from stress.

British Gas have finally apologised for his treatment - but have risked making matters worse by promising to contact him yet again to say sorry.

Stroke victim Alan Eacock, 73, says he has suffered 14 years of pestering from British Gas - despite the fact that he gets his electricity from Npower and even cut off his gas supply in a bid to end the bills and calls

Mr Eacock says he started receiving bills from the company soon after he moved into his flat in Kings Norton, Birmingham over 10 years ago.

He says he has since been contacted 'thousands' of times by the firm, despite repeatedly telling them he was not using any gas.

Following numerous visits by engineers but a continued barrage of mail and calls, he disconnected his gas meter.

But even that did not stop the company and he has continued to be contacted, with his most recent letter arriving in August, demanding £30.73.

Other bills however say Mr Eacock needs to pay £0.00 to the company.

Mr Eacock, who suffered a stroke 17 years ago, says he now wants to sue the energy giant for the stress caused.

Mr Eacock say he wants compensation from the company for his treatment

'I hate them. It's been an absolute nightmare. I have never used gas in the property. I have electric heaters and an electric oven,' he said.

'I even got the gas meter disconnected, but still British Gas keep sending me letters.'

The company referred demands for money to a debt collection agency, Improved Financial Solutions Ltd, at one point.

Mr Eacock, who gets his electricity from Npower, added: 'It is driving me mad. I am a strong-willed person, but it could easily send somebody else over the edge.

'Every time I see a new letter in the post I get really stressed, and often rip them up. I just want it to stop.

'I have had 14 years of hassle, phone calls and sitting in waiting for their visits. I just can't take it any more.'

British Gas say Mr Eacock was charged a £25 standing charge from 2013 because he had a meter, even though he was not using any gas, in line with Ofgem rules.

Because these bills were unpaid, they were referred to a debt collection agency. They insist he was contacted less than 10 times about this issue.

The company did however admit that Mr Eacock should not have received any bills after had his meter removed in April.

A spokesman said: 'When Mr Eacock contacted us earlier this year to ask for his meter to be removed, we should have closed his account straight away.

'Customers who do not use gas or electricity and have meter in their can ask for this to be done free of charge so they do not have to pay the standing charge.

'We should have done this immediately, given his circumstances, to resolve the issue. Mr Eacock's account is now closed and will not receive any more letters from us. We have contacted him to apologise and to offer a gesture of goodwill.'

The company has finally apologised to Mr Eacock and says it will 'contact him' to say sorry. File photo
