OLYMPIC horsewoman Lucinda Fredericks has split from her Australian husband Clayton after 15 years of marriage.

‘He’s gone back to Australia and we are getting divorced,’ Lucinda tells me sadly. ‘I’m still in shock.’

A golden girl of British equestrian sport, Lucinda, 46, won silver at Beijing. Everything seemed to be going brilliantly for her and her husband, with whom she set up a thriving equestrian business.

But last year Clayton flew back to his homeland. ‘I’ve no idea why he left me,’ she says. Now Lucinda admits she is finding it a struggle being a single parent to their ten-year-old daughter — and the rigours of managing her business.

She has already run into difficulties, upsetting locals in her Wiltshire village who are annoyed about the continuing presence of a ‘temporary’ mobile home and stables for which she had no planning consent.

Lucinda says: ‘All I’m trying to do is my best to survive. Life has been difficult since Clayton.’

IT'S early days yet, but the next time Prince Philip wants alterations to his many well-worn suits, he may need to congratulate his Savile Row tailor Patrick Grant. Oxford-educated Grant, who  steps out with Victoria Beckham’s handbag designer, Kate Hillier, is itching to start a family. ‘I’m 41 and we’ve been together for six years, so I’m more than ready for parenthood,’ he tells me at a Hardlyever wornit.com fashion charity party at the Dorchester. ‘I am hoping I don’t have  to wait too much longer.’

YOU would have thought having Abu Hamza as a neighbour would hardly have been good for property values. But just over a year after the hook-handed preacher was deported to the U.S., former business minister Lord Hutton has been leading by enterprising example.

Lord Hutton has put his £1.4million West London home on the market following the extradition of Abu Hamza

Eight years after moving in next door to the Hamza household, he has put his West London home on the market for £1.4 million.

As plain John Hutton, the ex-Labour Cabinet member bought the Shepherd’s Bush property for £565,000. Two years later — and at the height of Hamza’s extradition battle— he put it on the market for £1 million but it did not sell.

The five-bedroom, end-of-terrace property is being advertised with a local estate agency.

Although the agent mentions its ‘proximity to many local amenities’, no reference is made to the Hamza clan, who still live in their council-owned house.

Piano man: Billy Joel entertained diners on a recent evening out at Princess Diana's favourite restaurant

CROONER Billy Joel, on tour in the UK, popped in for lunch at one of Princess Diana’s favourite restaurants, La Famiglia in Chelsea, booking a quiet table in the window. But it didn’t stay quiet for long.

For as he waited for his seared tuna and rocket salad, Billy, 64, delighted fellow diners by suddenly breaking into song. ‘It was all very jolly,’ says one. ‘He was with a group of 12 all wearing leather jackets.

Among them was the singer Graham Parker and his group The Rumour.’

Joel, who wrote Uptown Girl for his then wife supermodel Christie Brinkley, was later heard praising rocker Jerry Lee Lewis. ‘He was the one for me, great guy,’ he told the group.

FRESH from starring as a masked sorceress in the TV cult show Game Of Thrones, Laura Pradelska tells me she has a new role — as a wife!

Millionaire’s daughter  Laura, 30, married Eurosports bigwig  Dennis Smith, five years her senior,  at her father’s Frankfurt estate.

She excitedly tells me: ‘We’ve been together for five years. I’m no Bridezilla, but I wanted to get married while my parents are still alive.

‘I wore a traditional white dress and my grandmother’s diamond engagement ring, which she somehow managed to retain through Auschwitz so it was a moving moment.

‘We had a few days in France, but we couldn’t take a honeymoon because we are too busy working.’

Laura left home for Hollywood as a teenager and now lives in London.

‘I met Dennis at a  dingy little club in Kings Cross and it was love at first sight!’ she says.  ‘We had a few vodka shots for a little courage and since then  we’ve been inseparable.’

Laura is rehearsing new play Dogstar, which premieres next week at Chiswick’s Tabard Theatre before the comedy transfers to the West End.

Her mother, Minka, is an esteemed academic and documentary  film maker.

‘Despite her serious work, she is supportive of what I’m doing,’ says Laura.

JUST four days after the death of PR genius Lesley Lake, who helped Barbara Hulanicki create the iconic Biba store, her grieving widower, writer Charles Mosley, has died, too.

The couple died in the same hospital, Stoke Mandeville. ‘She would have been glad to go first,’ says Lesley’s daughter Miranda, whose father was wine merchant Michael Druitt. Lesley, 81, had been divorced many years when she met Old Etonian  genealogist Mosley, 65, editor of Burke’s Peerage, at a New Year’s Eve party in the Nineties.

Last week, they attended the London launch of Charles’s first thriller, The Daffodil Library.
