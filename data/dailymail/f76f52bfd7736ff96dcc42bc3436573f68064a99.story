A millionaire fraudster who gave a record £2.4million to the Lib Dems was being hunted in his Caribbean hideout last night after three years on the run.

Michael Brown, 45, is living under an assumed name in the Dominican Republic, which has no extradition treaty with Britain.

Brown was convicted of stealing £36million from his clients in his absence in November 2008 after skipping bail and disappearing. He faces a seven-year jail sentence.

Rumours he fled to the Caribbean were
confirmed by police last night, who said they had been working urgently
behind the scenes for more than a year to bring him to justice.

The news triggered fresh embarrassment for the Lib Dems as senior figures admitted they had spent all the money.

Former leader Charles Kennedy said the donation – the biggest in the party’s history – had ‘long since been spent’.

He insisted the Lib Dems went the ‘extra mile’ to check out Brown before accepting the stolen cash ahead of the 2005 election.

Brown has been living a low-key life 
of luxury on the island, renting expensive properties and playing golf 
on exclusive courses. A photo from a golf club membership card revealed 
he has lost weight, grown a beard and allowed his blond-dyed hair to 
turn grey.

It emerged two men suspected of helping him flee Britain and adopt a new identity were arrested and questioned last Friday.

Senior officers are furious that the 
details have emerged because negotiations to secure Brown’s extradition 
were at a sensitive stage. No Briton has ever been forced to return from
the Dominican Republic but prosecutors remain hopeful they can secure a
ground-breaking deal.

Mugshot: Michael Brown is trapped in the Dominican Republic

Last night, Brown had fled his luxury home but remained effectively trapped in the island country which neighbours Haiti.

Detective Superintendent Bob Wishart,
of City of London Police, said: ‘We remain determined to ensure Michael
Brown is returned to the UK to face justice and serve his sentence – 
his victims and UK law demand no less.’

Brown had been due to stand trial in 
2008 charged with 18 offences, including money laundering, theft and 
perverting the course of justice.

He posed as an international bond 
dealer, pretended his father was a Lord, claimed connections with 
royalty, and promised investors returns of up to 50 per cent. Among his 
international array of victims was former Manchester United chairman 
Martin Edwards, who handed over £8million.

Brown mixed freely with senior Lib 
Dem figures, and channelled his substantial cash gift to them through a 
company called 5th Avenue Partners.

The Electoral Commission investigated the affair but ruled the party did not have to hand back the money.

The whereabouts of his wife of 15 years, Sharon, remains a mystery.

Brown’s mother, Patricia, who lives in a modest bungalow in East Lothian, refused to comment last night.

Speaking at the time of the donation, she said: ‘Let me just say that he has certain character flaws, and leave it at that.’

Despite the Lib Dems not being obliged to hand the money back, some have argued that the party have a moral duty to do so as it came from a fraudster, but the Lib Dems have always refused.

Vince Cable, when questioned on the matter last year by the BBC’s Jon Sopel insisted the party accepted the money ‘in good faith’ and would not be returning it.

Brown’s escape before the trial was facilitated by convicted drug smuggler Paul Nally, who gave him a fake passport and travelled with him to the Dominican Republic on June 30 2008, according to The Sunday Telegraph.

Nally came back a week later, but Brown stayed and set up bank accounts and real estate ventures using a fake name – Darren P Nally.

Brown’s disappearance was only possible in the first place because another Lib Dem donor, Lord Strasburger, had put up the £250,000 bail money.

However, he told The Sunday Telegraph that he simply wanted Brown to have ‘a fair trial and an opportunity to defend himself, whether he was innocent or not’.

He explained that Brown’s assets had been frozen because he was also facing a private prosecution for fraud by HSBC, so he couldn’t afford to pay any lawyers.

He added: ‘I just wanted there to be a level playing field so that justice could be served.

‘It was not a political issue as far as I was concerned, it was all about justice.

‘It was my decision alone and I had no input whatever from anyone else.’
