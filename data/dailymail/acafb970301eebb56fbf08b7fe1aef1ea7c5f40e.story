Canon Peter McBride led the requiem mass held at Miss Tait's local church. 

'Two weeks ago none of us could have foreseen the tragic events which have brought us to this church today; a horrendous accident which caused death and carnage,' he said. 

'Few in our city and our nation have been left untouched by the happenings on that fateful day. But for us who gather here, our grief and loss is acute, and our pain tangible.' 

'We come here as family to surround Alan, Margaret, Pamela and Martin with our presence, our prayers and our love.'  

A photograph printed on the back of the Order of Service was a photograph of Miss Tait and her partner, accompanied with the words: 'When it rains look for rainbows. When it's dark look for stars ... and think of me.'  

'All of us are still in a state of shock at the loss of Stephenie and that sense of loss will continue for those closest to her for the rest of their lives.

'However, we also gather as a people of faith, inspired by Stephenie’s own faith - a personal witness which energised her to dedicate her short life to teaching children and directly helping them to understand and feel God’s personal love for each of them.'

The 29-year-old had left behind a 'legacy of fun and laughter' after her untimely death. 

'She brought order, organisation, good humour and a sense of calm into family life, her teaching career, her parish ministry, and into her friendships. 

'Her attention to detail (especially personal grooming) is legendary, and she has left a legacy of fun and laughter combined with a strong determination to be all you can be.

'She was a modern woman with strong principles and values she felt were worth handing on to others.

'Although Stephenie’s death has caught us unprepared and thrown her into the centre of homes and communities where she was not known, her life has also greatly enriched so many who have known and loved her.

'Her dedication and service as a teacher, and her ability to engage and inspire all of us with an intimacy we normally only associate with family or special friends, is a blessing we shall cherish for the rest of our lives.' 

Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, the Archbishop of Glasgow who led a Christmas Eve service in honour of the crash,  and gave the final prayer. 

Among floral tributes was one from the 29-year-old's parents. An accompanying note read: 'Stephenie, our hearts are broken but we are so proud to be your mum and dad. All our love forever.'

Previously the headteacher of St Philomena's Primary School where Miss Tait worked described her as a 'fantastic' woman.

'Stephenie made a wonderful contribution to the life of St Philomena's. She will be sadly missed by both pupils and staff,' said Catherine Gallagher.

The tragedy has rocked the local community, with scores of people turning off their Christmas tree lights on December 25 in memory of those who lost their lives. 

Six people were killed, with another ten injured. Among them is the driver of the lorry who is thought to have taken ill at its wheel.  

A vigil was held in George Square in the days after Christmas, with a sea of flowers left at the crash site and in surrounding streets. 

Thousands of people attended the funeral of three victims from the same family - a woman and her two grandparents. 

Erin McQuade, her 68-year-old grandfather Jack Sweeney and his childhood sweetheart Lorraine, 69, were buried together last week in a service in Dunbarton. 

Services have also been held for Gillian Ewing, 52 and Jacqueline Morton, 51.
