A lawyer for phone-hacking victims in the UK will meet the American attorney representing 9/11 families who fear their phones were also illegally hacked.

Mark Lewis, the solicitor representing many celebrities who have won damages against the News of the World in London, is crossing the Atlantic to take the battle to the doorstep of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.

He is planning to launch three civil lawsuits over alleged phone-hacking against News Corp.

But while in New York Mr Lewis will 
also work with Norman Siegel, a lawyer who represents 20 families of 
victims of the 2001 outrage.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder 
launched an investigation last year after reports that News of the World
 journalists had asked a New York private detective to hack their 
phones, which he declined to do.

Mr Siegel said: ‘At the time we could 
not find any evidence anyone I represent was hacked. At this stage I 
can’t comment further because I don’t know what will come out of the 
meeting.’

Princess Diana’s former butler Paul 
Burrell is expected to be one of the trio of individuals due to launch 
lawsuits claiming that their phones were hacked while they were on U.S. 
soil.

Mr Lewis said that one of the alleged 
victims was connected to Princess Diana and the Royal household whilst a
 second is linked to the England football team.

The third is described as a ‘Hollywood case’ as the person was in touch with a well-known celebrity which made him a target.

In another first, at least once of the cases allegedly involves a phone belonging to a U.S. citizen.

Mr Lewis will file civil lawsuits in 
America on their behalf ‘imminently’ as all three are claiming that the 
criminality took place whilst they were on U.S. soil.

Possible victims: An acquaintance of Jude Law's (left) is thought to be one of the people whose phone was hacked at JFK airport, and David Beckham (right) is also allegedly a victim as well

The legal action could open up News 
Corp to further embarrassing revelations and bring the scandal to its 
headquarters in New York.

So far it has been largely confined to the UK.

In an interview with The Daily Beast, 
Lewis says that all of the numbers which were allegedly hacked were 
found in the notebooks of Glenn Mulcaire.

He was the private detective formerly 
employed by the News of the World, which was owned by News Corp 
subsidiary News International before the newspaper was closed down in 
July last year.

Lewis claims that the individuals 
themselves may not have been the only people who were targeted but those
 close to them too may have come under scrutiny.

Lawsuits: Lawyer Mark Lewis (left) said he will file civil lawsuits against Rupert Murdoch's (right) American branch of News Corp on behalf of his clients as all three claim the hacking took place  on U.S. soil

He told the Daily Beast: ‘This is getting wider.

‘It’s not just the people who were 
A-list or celebrities, but people who were in their circles - people who
 might call them or work with them, what I would call the ordinary 
people who just got caught in the crossfire’.

Lewis declined to say which newspaper 
carried out the alleged hacking but said he is keen to start requesting 
documents through the U.S. courts as soon as possible.

He said: ‘We’ve only seen the 
documents that exist in respect to News International in England, and 
there’s been no process of discovery in respect of News Corp.

‘That could be the next thing that we have to find out.’

Another arm of his legal action could 
be a separate lawsuit that examines ‘the dirty tricks that might have 
been used in order to further the commercial aims for News Corporation,’
 he added.

Earlier this month James Murdoch was forced to step down as chairman of BSkyB amid questions over his role in the scandal.

The FBI has already reportedly begun 
examining claims by the actor Jude Law that his phone was hacked by the 
News of the World whilst he was at JFK airport in New York.

News Corp declined to comment.
