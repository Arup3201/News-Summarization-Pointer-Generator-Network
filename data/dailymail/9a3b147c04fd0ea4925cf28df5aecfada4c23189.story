French counter-terrorism experts have identified 64 suburbs in dozens of cities that act as breeding grounds for Islamic extremism.

So-called 'ghettos' with high rates of youth unemployment, immigration and single-parent families, such as L'Ariane near Nice, have been linked to the radicalisation of young and vulnerable people.

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls last month admitted that the country had collapsed into social and ethnic 'apartheid' - the first time a senior politician has conceded that economic marginalisation and religious tensions have led to serious divides.

Until 17 people were killed in January's shocking Charlie Hebdo terror attacks, the French government remained largely consistent in its claim that overriding 'Frenchness' was a  unifying factor more powerful than loyalties to local communities or religious belief.

In total 64 French suburbs have been identified as breeding grounds for extremism, each of them sharing startling similar characteristics, according to Sky News.

Unemployment, for example, is on average 23 per cent in the suburbs, rising to a staggering 45 per cent among the young. Up to half of all families in the 64 suburbs also have just one parent.

For those lucky enough to have work, the average income is just €11,000 (£8,300) a year, leaving many with barely enough money to survive.

As many as 50 per cent of those living in the suburbs are also first generation immigrants or their children, many of them having travelled to France from war-torn nations. 

Such patterns of have now proved to the French leadership that vast swathes of the population are falling behind economically, resulting in   ghettoised suburbs where mental and social attachment to France as a nation holds little sway, and where criminal and religious leaders often wield power.

As well as identifying 64 suburbs as having the potential to push the young and vulnerable towards extremism, the French interior ministry has also designated 15 Priority Security Zones in areas already considered hotbeds of crime - with radical Islamism and jihadism chief among them.

Speaking to Sky News, Colonel Gael Marchand, head of the Gendarmerie in Alpes-Maritime, said: 'There is a very blurred and small gap between organised crime and terrorism.'

'Terrorists need funding and they are often recruited in prisons. If you're a terrorist and a former criminal you know where and how to get weapons,' he added.

He added that weapons, including guns, are easy to come by in these 15 areas, as each of them extensive links to mafia smuggling routes from Italy and eastern Europe.

The 15 areas, which have not been identified, have already been reinforced by  undercover investigators and uniformed officers, with rapid response road blocks and random weapon and drugs checks now in force in an effort to reduce the rate of criminality.

The French government has been ridiculed for producing a poster to help identify potential jihadists - with one suggestion that giving up baguettes is a telltale sign.

They claim pointers that someone is being radicalised by Islamist fanatics include alarm bells such as losing interest in sports, rejecting family members and changing eating habits.

The poster was launched as part of a new £320million campaign to counter terrorism in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks.

But the attempt to inform the public backfired, with many ridiculing the Stop Jihadism poster for the suggestions it made.

News of the terrorism breeding grounds being identified comes as French police arrested eight men suspected of recruiting fighters for Islamist militants in Syria.

The arrests in the Paris and Lyon areas are not linked to the Charlie Hebdo attacks, Interior Minister Barnard Cazeneuve told local media.

The French government believes that around 400 French citizens have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside militants from the Islamic State terror group.

There are also approximately 900 Islamic extremists still in France with links to recruitment cells.

Mr Cazeneuve said 161 terror-related legal proceedings were in progress, with 547 individuals suspected of involvement in terror networks. 

The majority of these relate to the funding and recruitment for terrorist groups, rather than the plotting of terror attacks themselves.
