French runner Jeremy Jurkiewicz was close to victory at the Ironman 70.3 Brazil race when he, extraordinarly, started gloating just meters from the tape.

Knowing he was well ahead, Jurkiewicz slowed down and laughed with spectators, pretending to be an airplane.

But what he didn't know was that just round the corner rival Igor Amorelli of Brazil was catching up fast.

Spectators at the punishing triathlon race in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia were treated to bizarre scenes as Amorelli spotted his opportunity.

Brazilian Amorelli ran for it, broke into full sprint and caught up with Jurkiewicz as he was celebrating victory rather prematurely.  

Luckily for Jurkiewicz, who turned round and saw at the last second what was about to happen, Amorelli was a gentleman.

Pictures from the race shows the Brazilian virtually giving way as Jurkiewicz suddenly jump started back into the race at the weekend and won it at a time of 3:52:40.3.

Amorelli finished the race after nearly four hours at 3:52:42.0.

Spectators at the race, which is punishing for the runners with its different disciplines including cycling and swimming, were left aghast, and asked themselves what prompted him to stop and celebrate.

'In what world does Jurkiewicz think nothing will screw him over if he stops short and chills?,' one commentator wrote for website Deadspin.

'Just break the tape, then go do whatever you want. He just trekked almost 70.3 miles, but now he feels like pulling up for a quick chat.'

A couple of meters from the finishing line, Amorelli's killer instinct finally failed him.

Amorelli appeared to slow down and make way - perhaps out of pity - virtually handing victory to the Frenchman.
