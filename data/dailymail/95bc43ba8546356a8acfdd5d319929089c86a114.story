Having spent 15 years in the NFL watching linebackers run towards him in an attempt to leave him on the ground, there can't be much that scares New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

But it seems the four-time Super Bowl winner has met his match.

The 37-year-old shared a video on Facebook of himself diving off a cliff into a pool at the bottom of a waterfall while on a family holiday, accompanied by his wife Gisele Bundchen.

Brady wrote a message to accompany the video saying: 'Never doing that again! #AirBrady'.

The Patriots quarterback is taking a well-earned break after guiding New England to a thrilling Super Bowl victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona last month.

The 28-24 victory over Seattle at the University of Phoenix Stadium on February 1 clinched an elusive fourth Super Bowl ring for Brady, a decade after he won his third.

Brady and his family have recently been in Costa Rica on a family holiday.Â
