The Chinese Grand Prix ended two laps earlier than scheduled after the chequered flag was mistakenly waved before the end of the race.

Incredibly, the embarrassing blunder greeted the leader, and eventual winner, Lewis Hamilton, who reported the mistake over the team radio as he began his final lap.

'That was very strange. I was thinking "am I seeing things?",' Hamitlon said afterwards. 'I looked up, I was coming across the line expecting to do another lap and all of a sudden I looked for a split second and I saw the flag.

'I lifted for a second and I saw there was no one on the wall, so then I just kept going. 'I did lose a second or so. I asked the team, they said no, so I just kept going.'

Man in the middle: Hamilton with his Mercedes mechanics after winning his third consecutive race

Under FIA rules, the race was subsequently classified after 54 laps, rather than the scheduled 56-lap race.

While Hamilton's victory still stood, the error meant Caterham driver Kamui Kobayashi's last-lap move on the Marussia of Jules Bianchi for 17th did not count.

The ruling states:  'Should for any reason the end-of-race signal be given before the leading car completes the scheduled number of laps, or the prescribed time has been completed, the race will be deemed to have finished when the leading car last crossed the line before the signal was given.'

At this stage it remains unclear why the chequered flag was waved prematurely; although it is worth noting that there were several erroneous blue flags – which warns a driver that he is about to be lapped – throughout today's race.

Sebastian Vettel was, rather painfully, ordered to move over for Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo for the second consecutive race.

Unlike in the previous round at Bahrain however, the four-time world champion wasn't compliant, saying 'tough luck' upon discovering that the faster Ricciardo was on fresher tyres.

The Australian passed Vettel two laps later, but there remains some doubt as to whether the 26-year-old had actually given the place.

Indeed, it's not beyond the realms of possibility that Vettel went too deep on his brakes at Turn 1, rather than moving aside.

'I think there was no point holding him back further,' Vettel, who finished a whopping 25 seconds adrift of Ricciardo, said after the race, insistent that he played to the team instruction.

The result comes after Vettel, who ended the race in fifth, was out-qualified by Ricciardo for the third time in four races this season on Saturday.

And his difficult weekend further intensified when he was overtaken by the Caterham backmarker of Kobayashi in the closing stages.

Red Bull team principal admitted that Vettel doesn't have 'the feel that he usually gets from the car which is so unusual'. 

Concerning times for the man who dominated the sport last season.

On the run: The reigning world champion has endured a troubled start to the 2014 campaign

Hamilton's 25th career victory takes him to eighth on the all-time list alongside his boss, in Niki Lauda, and the legendary Jim Clark, whose pole record he surpassed yesterday.

His flawless display also marked the first time he had won three consecutive races in his grand prix career, becoming the first Briton to achieve such a feat since Jenson Button claimed four on the spin in 2009.

Following on from Nico Rosberg's dominant display in Australia, Hamilton's ominous performance also means that Mercedes have now led every lap of the first four races.  Williams were the last team to do that when Nigel Mansell stormed to victories in South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and Spain back in 1992.

Felipe Massa's chances of finishing inside the top six were dealt a fatal blow after a rather embarrassing pit-stop which saw the Williams man re-join the race track in last place.

Massa made an electric – and wild start – banging wheels with former Ferrari team-mate Fernando Alonso after being squeezed by the Red Bulls.

He was running in sixth at the time of his stop, but ended the race down in 15th after a mix-up by the Williams mechanics who had mistakenly swapped the rear wheels around.

Upon realising their gaffe, the mechanics swapped sides, only for there then to be a problem getting the rear-left tyre on to Massa's Williams.

'There was a mistake at the first pit-stop and that effectively lost me the race as I came back out on track in last position,' said Massa.

'It is a frustrating situation and something we need to work on to make sure that it doesn't happen again.'

Out of sorts: Kimi Raikkonen finished 50 seconds adrift of Ferrari team-mate Fernando Alonso

Kimi Raikkonen continues to be blown away by Fernando Alonso following his winter switch to Ferrari.

The Finn, who qualified a miserable 12th yesterday, has managed just eight laps ahead of Alonso at the opening four races, and finished toady's grand prix a gargantuan 50 seconds adrift of his team-mate.

Indeed, while Alonso celebrated his and Ferrari's first podium of the season, Raikkonen finished a lowly eighth, some 20 seconds down on Valterri Bottas, who was one place better off.

The Finn has just 11 points to his name; he had 67 at the same stage last season.
