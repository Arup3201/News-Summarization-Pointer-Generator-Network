One scientist has revealed the psychology of Tetris (pictured) on its 30th birthday - or World Tetris Day

Many of us have been guilty of wasting time playing Tetris and finding ourselves unable to stop.

And now one scientist has revealed the psychology of the popular game on its 30th birthday, 6 June -also known as World Tetris Day.

Dr Tom Stafford said the game of tessellating bricks takes advantage of the mind’s basic pleasure in tidying up by feeding it with a ‘world of perpetual uncompleted tasks’.

Over the last 30 years, people across the world have spent millions of hours fitting falling shapes into rows playing one of the biggest-selling computer games of all time.

Dr Stafford, of the University of Sheffield’s Department of Psychology explained that the chain of partial-solutions and the prospect of solving more mini tasks is as satisfying as scratching an itch.

Previous research has indicated that there are two ways of working out the puzzle – either by mentally rotating the brick in your mind’s eye and imagining how it might fit into the line of blocks on the bottom, or by clicking to rotate the block quickly, so you can do a visual comparison.

The study found that most people prefer to use the keys to rotate the blocks in order to work out where best to fit them, instead of imaging them turning.

Dr Stafford thinks that one of the attractions of the game is that it is easier to think with it than about it, in what scientists call an epistemic action.

He believes Tetris proves that games can be addictive and immersive without having amazing graphics and realism.

Tetris also plays on the 'Zeigarnik effect', which shows that people more easily remember uncompleted tasks than those that they have finished.

‘Tetris does this wonderfully…it presents a world of perpetual uncompleted tasks,’ Dr Stafford said.

‘It shows how our minds are organised around goals and that our memory is not just a filing system where information is passively stored, but it adjusts dynamically according to our purposes.’

Dr Stafford thinks that the genius of Tetris is that it takes advantage of this memory hook for uncompleted tasks. ‘It involves us in a compulsive loop of completing and generating new tasks and that keeps us endlessly playing.’

Dr Stafford said that Tetris is the granddaddy of addictive puzzle games like Candy Crush saga.

‘Tetris is pure game: there is no benefit to it, nothing to learn, no social or physical consequence. It is almost completely pointless, but keeps us coming back for more.’
