Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond warned of the damage that uninsured drivers do to honest motorists

More than £5million worth of fines have been collected from uninsured drivers over the last two years, new figures reveal today.

And nearly 2,500 uninsured vehicles are seized by police each week.

The figures cover the period since a change in the law to bring in Continuous Insurance Enforcement (CIE).

Ministers say uninsured drivers are a serious danger killing 130 people and injuring 26,500 every year while pushing up the insurance premiums of innocent law-abiding drivers.

The AA estimates that uninsured 
drivers cost Britain at least £380million every year and add about £33 
to the cost of every car insurance policy.

About
a million people – or one in 36 of all vehicle owners – are estimated 
to be without insurance, says the Government-backed Motor Insurers’ 
Bureau (MIB) which compiled the latest figures.

Under
Continuous Insurance Enforcement, the DVLA’s records of vehicle keepers
are systematically matched with the insurance record on the Motor 
Insurance Database (MID), which is the central record of all insured 
vehicles in the UK.

The new
report said £5.1 million in fixed penalties and court fines have now 
been collected from the tens of thousands of owners who have admitted or
been found guilty of being uninsured to drive.

The Motor Insurers’ Bureau report said: ’Police powers to seize vehicles on the road for no insurance coupled with Continuous Insurance Enforcement are making a significant contribution to reducing uninsured driving in the UK and have contributed to a 40per cent reduction in the level and impact of uninsured driving. ‘

‘It is estimated that uninsured drivers kill 130 people and injure 26,500 every year but more still needs to be done.’

Ashton West, Chief Executive of the Motor Insurers’ Bureau, said: ‘There is no let-up in the efforts to catch those people who have no insurance for their vehicle.

'The Motor Insurance Database is a powerful tool for enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal motorists and reduce the very real and significant impact of uninsured driving. 

‘Whether it’s a fixed penalty or your vehicle being seized, we are seeing the continued benefits of having a central database that the Police and DVLA can use to enforce the law. This is good news for all honest motorists.’

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond 
said: ‘Uninsured drivers are a danger on our roads. They push up 
premiums for other motorists and often drive with no regard for other 
road users, so it is vital that we do everything we can to keep them off
the roads.

'That is why we introduced Continuous Insurance Enforcement, which is an excellent example of government and the private sector working together for the benefit of the honest motorist.'

Mr Hammond said: ’The action taken in the last two years has helped reduce the number of uninsured drivers and we will continue to work closely with the motor insurance industry to tackle this important issue.’

The Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB) sends advisory letters to the owners of vehicles that appear to have no insurance. 

Recipients of these initial warning letters -  who may be unaware of the change in law - are given a range of options to avoid enforcement action.

These include the vehicle off the road (Statutory Off Road Notification), getting properly insured, or contacting their insurer to make sure that their insurance record has been correctly uploaded to the database.

Officials said the new system is having ‘a positive impact’ noting: ‘Collectively hundreds of thousands more vehicles have been correctly recorded on the Motor Insurers’ Database helping motorists avoid the inconvenience of having to prove their vehicle is insured. 

‘Illegal  drivers are being automatically identified and prosecuted and our roads are safer as a result.’

It said: ’Every hour, 1,200 people check that their vehicle is recorded on the database and that they are compliant with the change in law. At the same time insurers are continuously updating motor polices with 12,000 changes made every hour.’

It added: ‘On average the public make two million enquiries of the Motor insurers’ Database every month when renewing their tax disc.

In addition to using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, the Police make 1.8 million enquiries to the MID every month to check a vehicle’s insurance status. 

Between 3,000 and 4,000 calls are also made every week to the Motor Insurers’ Bureau  dedicated police helpline to seek assistance in validating a vehicle’s insurance status before determining what action to take.
