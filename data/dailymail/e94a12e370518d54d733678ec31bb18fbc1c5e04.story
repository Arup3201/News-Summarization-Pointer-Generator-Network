Legendary NASCAR driver Dick Trickle suffered chronic debilitating pain in his chest before his suicide according to Chuck, his brother.

Trickle, 71, who died on Thursday from a self inflicted gunshot wound was so distressed by his mystery ailment that he visited doctors twice a day.

According to his brother the popular racer became depressed by the discomfort under his left breast telling him that he 'didn't know how much longer he could take the pain.'

'It's a shock to me,' said Chuck Trickle to The Las Vegas Review Journal. 'It's real hard to think about. He was my brother, my friend and my hero, in that order.'

'He was very down.'

Chuck, who lives in Las Vegas said that to his knowledge his brother was healthy, except for the pain under his chest, but when they last spoke a week ago he suspected that something was wrong when he heard his brother curse.

Chuck Trickle said his brother was so beloved that 'he could’ve run for president and won.'

'He was there for everybody,' Chuck Trickle said. 'He left a very large footprint on this earth.'

Chuck’s son, Chris, was shot in 1997 while driving in Las Vegas. He died the following year, and the case never was 
solved.

During his racing career, he attracted attention when he drilled a hole in his safety helmet to allow him to smoke a cigarette as he competed.

He also installed cigarette lighters in his cars so he could smoke during races, the local news station noted.

Trickle recalled in an interview with Fox Sports two years ago of a fan who came up to him while signing autographs and asked him about the cigarettes.

'He says, 'how many cigarettes did you smoke during that race?' And I said, "how many yellows were there?" I said, "one for every yellow."

Trickle said he quit smoking two and a half years before that interview but did it 'just for no good reason.'

NASCAR legend Richard 'Dick' Trickle died on Thursday at age 71 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police confirmed.

The body of the retired race car driver was found at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Boger City, North Carolina, 30 miles west of Charlotte. His body was discovered near his pickup truck.

It is not known why he chose the cemetery as the location to end his life.

The victim had actually called police before shooting himself and forewarned them 'there would be a dead body and it would be his.'

Trickle made his debut on the NASCAR circuit in the #84 Miller High Life Buick for Stavola Brothers Racing.

His career spanned 24 years, during which he competed in a total of 2,200 races.

Dubbed the 'White Knight' by his corporate sponsor  SuperAmerica, he was said to have nabbed the most wins in short track racing.

He was named the Rookie of the Year in NASCAR's Winston Cup in 1989 at age 48.

During races ESPN commentators Dan Patrick and 
Keith Olbermann also enjoyed making light of the alliteration in his name and
 would always take notice of Trickle's finish, regardless of his 
placement, according to WCNC-TV.

'No sports figure Dan + I had fun with took it more graciously. In fact, gratefully,' Olbermann tweeted on Thursday.

Former
 NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine expressed his grief over the sudden news of 
his friend while remembering him in an interview with the Associated 
Press as a man who was 'fun, just plain fun.'

Retirement: After retiring from the sport Trickle said he hoped to live out the remainder of his days as a grandfather at home in North Carolina

'It's
 all just sad. We don't understand why he would do this. Hopefully we 
will all learn why he would do that. There was something that triggered 
him to take his own life. We are all really saddened by this in the 
racing community,' Bodine said.

Trickle lived in Iron Station, N.C., for more than 20 years. Bodine said Trickle was full of stories and popular because of it.

'People
 everywhere knew his name,' Bodine said. 'That’s why they used his 
likeness in that movie Days of Thunder. He was such a character.'

The main character in that popular niche racing movie, played by Tom Cruise, was named Cole Trickle.

Bodine said that a few years ago he had 
to back out of a celebrity cruise for patients who were on kidney 
dialysis. He asked Trickle to fill in.

'He made such an impression on people on that ship that everyone wanted to know when Dick was coming back,' Bodine said. 'They loved him. They tell me he was the last man to leave most of the bars on the ship and I believe it.'

Bodine also recalled inviting Trickle to compete in one of his bobsled events in 2004 at Lake Placid, New York.

- Trickle on how he wanted to be remembered

He said Trickle went down the first time and crashed. After being cleared by doctors to continue, Trickle tried again and crashed in the same place.

'They were doing interviews with him on TV and he was like, "I don’t know what happened, I did the exact same thing I did the first time,”’ Bodine said. 'And we’re all looking at him like, hey Dick, maybe that was the problem.'

When Trickle was asked how he hoped to be remembered in his interview two years ago, he answered: 'I just want to be who I am and satisfied that I had a great career. I'm happy with it. I think I made a lot of friends.'

He also said he hoped to live out the remainder of his days as a 'stay-at-home grandpa.'

In a statement, NASCAR said its thoughts and prayers were with Trickle's family and friends.

'Dick
 was a legend in the short-track community, particularly in his home 
state of Wisconsin, and he was a true fan favorite,' NASCAR's statement 
read in part. 'Personalities like Dick Trickle helped shape our sport. 
He will be missed.'

Sheriff's Lieutenant Tim Johnson says foul play is not suspected.
