Liverpool have an interest in Karim Benzema and Isco at Real Madrid but won't upset the harmony of the squad to bring them in.

Brendan Rodgers is signing Loic Remy and Dejan Lovren, while Divock Origi will return to Lille on loan.

Benzema is close to agreeing terms on a new contract and Madrid are keen to bring in another striker as cove, with Alvaro Morata having joined Juventus.

Wanted man: Liverpool are considering a move to bring Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema to Anfield

Benzema would cost £40million and wages of around £200,000 a week. It would give Liverpool the star quality they have lost with Luis Suarez's departure but is not a simple deal.

Isco will be pushed further down the pecking order with the arrival of James Rodriguez but so far he wants to stay at Madrid. A loan could be feasible as the window draws to a close.

Madrid, meanwhile, are discussing the possibility of Angel di Maria joining Paris Saint-Germain on loan with £47.5m following next summer to suit FFP regulations.

Tiago Mendes was expected to be joining Chelsea on a free transfer from Atletico but he is now considering the option of joining Valencia instead.

It is understood the deal has been complicated by his agent Jorge Mendes still holding a share of the player's economic rights. That compromises third party ownership legislation in this country and negotiations have stalled.

Mendes has interest in Valencia and Tiago has an offer from them while Atletico have also made the 33-year-old a renewed offer of a one year contract worth £2m a year.

Barcelona midfielder Xavi is poised to announce his decision to join New York City this week.

Following months of uncertainty over the Spanish star’s future, the Barca icon has decided to follow David Villa and Frank Lampard to the Manchester City-owned franchise.

The question that remains is where he spends his time between now and next March when training begins. Lampard and Villa are already heading to Melbourne City but Xavi has also had achilles problems and needs rest first.

VIDEO Toure to stay at City

In a report from Spanish sports daily, Sport, Barcelona and Xavi’s agent are working hard to finalise the move before the player is scheduled to rejoin the club on Thursday.

The only remaining details are the transfer fee and scheduling a testimonial. The 34-year-old has spoken to manager Luis Enrique and is expected to issue a statement in the coming days.

Lekhwiya are keeping a keen eye on developments with Wilfried Bony at Swansea.

Liverpool
 like the Ivory Coast striker but their reservations over his 
wages plus Swansea's demands for £25million have put that deal on ice.

Tottenham
 have an interest but have yet to follow up with a bid while Everton see
 him as an alternative to Romelu Lukaku but would have similar fears 
over the finances.

In demand: Swansea forward Wilfried Bony is being considered by Everton, Tottenhan and Qatari side Lekhwiya

Michael 
Laudrup brought Bony to Wales and is keen to strengthen his new club in 
Qatar. He missed out on a deal for Michu who joined Napoli instead but 
will see if Bony wants to move to Lekhwiya.

Tottenham
 meanwhile are among clubs showing an interest in PSV Eindhoven's 
Memphis Depay but they are working on other priorities first, notably 
Morgan Schneiderlin at Southampton.

Hajduk
 Split midfielder Nikola Vlasic is one they have considered and Franco 
Baldini held discussions in May with the croatians about potential deals
 for him and teammate Andrija Balic.

Split
 will sell for £6million but so far the only club to make an offer for 
Vlasic is Roma and they are short on the asking price.

Leicester are maintaining an interest in Metalist Kharkiv striker Sebastian Blanco.

Blanco is in his native Argentina while his team-mates are on a pre-season training camp in Austria but he is refusing to go back to the Ukraine following the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.

Six South American Shakhtar Donetsk players have also refused to go back to Ukraine. And Blanco told Argentinian paper Ole that he has no intention of returning to Kharkiv.

Controversy: Leicester are keen on Sebastian Blanco, who is refusing to return to Ukraine with Metalist Kharkiv

Blanco said: 'With what happened I did not feel like returning to Ukraine. These are not normal times. My decision is to stay in Buenos Aires. I will not return to Ukraine.'

Kharkiv is just 50km from the Russian border in the west of Ukraine where tensions are rising.

Leicester were interested in Blanco earlier this summer and although they have moved on with some signings, notably the £7.5m deal for Leonardo Ulloa, they recognise the 26-year-old attacking midfielder could be available for a knockdown price of £2m.

On the move: Leonardo Ulloa is close to completing his move from Brighton to newly promoted Leicester

Meanwhile, Watford are understood to have offered £1.2m for Leicester's Wales midfielder Andy King.

Watford are bracing themselves for further bids for Troy Deeney with QPR in the running as well as Burnley and Swansea.

A number of Championship clubs are weighing up a loan move for Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker.

The 19-year-old had a hand in all three goals during their 3-2 win over AFC Wimbledon on Saturday.

Former Leeds United recruitment director Luke Dowling and ex-Chelsea assistant manager Ray Wilkins were in the stands among others scouting for prospective signings and Baker was one of the Blues' best performers.

Bright future: Bolton and Birmingham are among the clubs keen on Chelsea youngster Lewis Baker (left)

He has been at the club since the age of nine and maintained steady progress, captaining the U21s and making his debut in the FA Cup against Derby last season. Competition is such in midfield that a loan may be his best route to the next stage of his development.

Middlesbrough, Bolton and Birmingham are among those who are keen.

Burnley are making an improved offer for West Bromwich Albion defender Craig Dawson.

The 24-year-old Rochdale-born centre back is keen to link up with Sean Dyche as he believes he will get a regular run in the side and has asked to leave.

Albion have rejeceted two bids so far and Burnley are looking at around £3million. Burnley also like Nathaniel Chalobah at Chelsea and will ask to take the 19-year-old on loan.

Joe Thompson, who only last month was given the all clear after battling non Hodgkin's Lymphona, has made his playing comeback with Bury.

The 25-year-old winger has been with Tranmere Rovers during his illness but his contract had ended and, while talks are ongoing over a possible new deal, as a free agent he took the opportunity to play in Friday's friendly against Sheffield United. Thompson is now looking to get his career back on track and is talking to interested clubs.

Charlton have completed the signing of goalkeeper Stephen Henderson from West Ham on a three-year contract.

The 26-year-old moves to The Valley after seeing a move to Blackburn Rovers stall earlier in the month and becomes new manager Bob Peeters’ eighth signing of the summer following Yoni Buyens, Igor Vetokele, Andre Bikey, Franck Moussa, Tal Ben Haim, Johann Berg Gudmundsson and George Tucudean.
