Paris is known as many things – a city of romance, fine restaurants, epic landmarks and grand architecture.

But it all comes at a price, boasting some of the most expensive accommodation in the world.

However, one hotel is hoping to change all that, by allowing holidaymakers to pay what they believe is a reasonable rate for their stay this summer.

City of high prices: Paris is famed for its expensive accommodation

Hotelier Aldric Duval 
has launched the enterprising ‘Payez ce que vous voulez’ (‘Pay what you 
want’) promotion in a bid to draw extra guests to Tour d-Auvergne, his 
three-star hotel in the central Opera district of the city.

The idea is simple. A visitor can pay exactly what they want to stay the night.

Normally,
 double rooms at the hotel would cost at least €190 (£150) – but should 
they decide that it is an appropriate amount, visitors can pay as little
 as €1 (80p).

The promotion runs until August 10.

A leap into the unknown: Aldric Duval hopes his 'pay what you want' scheme will be a mould-breaker

Obviously, Mr Duval hopes that guests will not pay as small a sum as €1.

The point of the scheme, he says, is to give customers a little financial freedom in a city of notoriously high costs.

‘If the client wants to pay €1, there is nothing I can do,’ Mr Duval told CNN.

‘But people will know this is not a good deal. We will explain it’s not fair if they pay one euro.’

The experiment will also give the hotel useful information about the sums people are prepared to pay for accommodation as Europe struggles back out of recession.

Familiar scenes: Paris is known for its landmarks and its restaurants - but rarely as a place for bargain deals

He hopes that visitors to the city will treat the scheme as a good deal, but not abuse it.

‘We could have run a promotion offering 
free rooms to the first 15 people to answer a question on our website – 
but we’ve decided to do this instead,’ he explained.

The scheme has proved sufficiently inspiring that Mr Duval has had enquiries from other hoteliers in Paris – and further afield in Nice and Cannes – as to how it works.

If the idea takes off, Paris may soon be known as the city of great room rates.

Or as the city of bankrupt hoteliers.
