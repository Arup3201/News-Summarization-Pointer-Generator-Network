Michael Carrick insists he puts his club allegiances aside when he comes away with the England team and has not mentioned Manchester United’s win against Liverpool to his international team-mates.

Louis van Gaal’s side delivered a crushing blow to Liverpool’s Champions League chances with their 2-1 win at the weekend.

A large contingent from both teams have joined up with the England squad, Carrick accompanied by United team-mates Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Wayne Rooney while Liverpool are represented by Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge, before he withdrew from the squad due to injury.

But Carrick prefers to focus solely on the national team during the international break. ‘To be honest it's something that I have never really tried to bring up when I have met up with England through the years,’ he said. 

‘If we have had a good or bad result versus someone I have just let it go out of respect, it’s done and dusted and we are here to achieve something else. That is done and we look forward to Friday.’ 

They will put any club rivalry aside when the England team face Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier.

But Carrick admits that a big win ahead of a national team game increases a player’s confidence, adding: ‘It certainly helps. It has been a good week with United, beating Tottenham as well, and I am enjoying my football so it is great to be back.

‘Turning up knowing you are confident and you are looking forward to the next game and when things are going well you just want to get out there and play football and that is what it’s like at the moment.’
