He'll be nine months old tomorrow and Prince George is already getting his teeth – all three of them – into his royal duties.

The infant was keen to nibble anything he could get his little hands on during a visit to Taronga Zoo in Sydney yesterday with his parents.

After his attempt to grab a bilby – a native Australian marsupial – was thwarted, he settled for enthusiastically chewing a car sticker reading ‘Wild child on board’.

‘Munch, munch, munch,’ laughed Prince William, who suggested that teething George had caused his parents sleepless nights.

He
 said his son had been ‘wreaking havoc’ at night at Admiralty House, the
 royals’ base during the Sydney leg of their tour Down Under.

William,
 31, said: ‘I’ve been a bit concerned – he is destroying everything.’ 
Kate also described George as ‘cute and very noisy’ to well-wishers.

The
 zoo visit was George’s second ever public engagement and he was clearly
 excited to be introduced to the bilby, one of Australia’s best-loved 
and most endangered species.

Not as well known as the kangaroo, bilbies 
are nonetheless something of a national treasure – many Australians give
 chocolate bilbies at Easter instead of bunnies or eggs.

But
 as far as the little prince was concerned, he was just a funny looking 
creature with a long tail that was perfect for pulling.

The
 animal was originally called Boy but has been renamed after the future 
king.

Wriggling his arms and legs in excitement, George (the human one) 
squealed and gurgled when he spotted his namesake.

His
 parents took it in turns to hold him in their arms and to support him 
standing up, restraining him as he tried to climb into the enclosure.

For me? George reaches out to grab the toy bilby, a gift from the zoo

I'm bored now: After a few moments he throws it to the ground

To the rescue: Kate laughs as she picks up the cuddly toy

That's more like it! Babies tend to chew on things to lessen the pain while teething and George was keen to nibble anything he could get his little hands on during his zoo visit

‘He’s
 trying to grab his ear,’ said Kate, 32. ‘If he gets it he’ll never let 
go,’ added William. As the keeper went to coax the bilby closer to 
George, Kate stopped him, saying: ‘He’s got quite a strong grab 
actually.’

George took a 
dimmer view of a toy bilby he was presented with by the zoo, chucking it
 aside – to the embarrassment of his mother, who scrambled to pick it 
up.

Kate was wearing a 
primrose yellow broderie anglaise dress which she previously wore during
 the Jubilee Tour of 2012 in the Solomon Islands, with Stuart Weitzman 
Minx wedges and Kiki McDonough citrine drop earrings.

George wore a striped jersey polo and matching £55 pocket shorts, both by designer Rachel Riley.

And George's good looks have even been rated by a 'facial beauty analyst test.'

What's this? George is fascinated by the bilby, a small marsupial

Still looks cute: Prince George scrunches up his face and still manages to look adorable

The online test, by Anaface.com, rates 'attractiveness' based on the geometry of a face, and has scored George 5.5 out of 10.

If
 you think the results don't quite do the Prince justice, fear not.

There's no scientific evidence to support these 'findings,' though they 
do at least mark young George higher than both his father and 
grandfather, Prince Charles, as youngsters.

William rated 5.07 in the test, whilst the Prince of Wales as a baby scored just 0.97.

The test rates attractiveness by measuring 17 'key points' on the face based on symmetry and  proportion.

It would seem beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.
