Gay marriage supporters got a surprise during a rally in California when a local branch of Chick-fil-A tried to offer them free food - despite the fast food chain's boss's outspoken opposition to their cause.

The unexpected gesture by the outlet in Rancho Cucamonga comes after the firm's president Dan Cathy drew outrage from gay rights groups when he said in an interview last year that his company is ‘very much supportive of the family,’ but only when it involves heterosexual couples.

But some protesters refused to accept the offer claiming it was a cheap publicity stunt.

Gesture: The owner of the Chick-fil-A branch in Rancho Cucamonga in California surprised gay marriage campaigners by giving them free meals during a rally

Anti-gay: Chick-fil-A president Dan Cathy's comments against gay marriage have caused a huge amount of criticism from consumers

Corey Braun, the owner of the 
Chick-fil-A branch that handed out the free meals, said the pro-gay 
marriage rally outside his restaurant was an opportunity for him to show
hospitality to members of the community - whatever their beliefs.

'I wanted to show that Chick-fil-A doesn't discriminate against anybody,' he told the Los Angeles Daily News.

He said his outlet was happy 'to serve the community and this was an opportunity to have this group come in and show them our hospitality regardless of their beliefs, sexual orientation, or whatever.'

The gesture has drawn a mixed response from the gay community in California, with one activist describing the move as 'surreal.'

Hundreds of the firm's supporters - many of who oppose gay marriage - have reportedly travelled to the restaurant in Rancho Cucamonga to show their support for Mr Braun's stance on 'Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day.'

Mr Braun said he believes Mr Cathy's 
comments were taken out of context and that the fast food chain 'has 
never been about hate,' according to Fox News.

Sharon Graff, pastor at the local 
Redlands United Church of Christ, who spoke at the pro-gay marriage rally 
said: 'All people deserve the same rights in this country, when the 
Supreme Court has on its buildings - equal justice under the law - it 
means that.'

Chick-fil-A, which is based in Atlanta currently has
1,608 locations and boasts sales of more than $4billion.
