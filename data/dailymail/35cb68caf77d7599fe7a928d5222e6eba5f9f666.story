Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has warned of a risk to patient safety after figures revealed a significant rise in the use of private sector ambulances by some trusts

Labour has warned of a risk to patient safety after figures revealed a significant rise in the use of private sector ambulances by some trusts.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said people would be stunned that 'blue-light 999 services' were being privatised without proper debate.

He will write to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to ask for an urgent assurance about the safety and quality of all privately-provided emergency ambulance services.

Freedom of Information requests 
submitted by Labour revealed increases on spending by three English 
ambulance services on private contractors in the last two years.

The biggest rise in spending was in London which saw a tenfold increase in the amount spent increase from £400,000 in 2010/11 to £4.2million in 2012/13.

South East Coast Ambulance service spent £7.3million up from £1.9million in 2010/11 while in Yorkshire the spend on private 
contractors went up from £500,000 to £1.8million.

Mr Burnham said: 'When people dial 
999, they don't expect a private ambulance to turn up. This news will 
open people's eyes to the way the NHS is changing under David Cameron.

'People will be stunned to learn that even blue-light 999 services are being privatised without proper debate.

'It is proof that the Coalition sees 
no limits on privatisation in the NHS. They are driving the private 
sector into the public core of the NHS, offering up essential emergency 
provision to the lowest bidder.

'Whistleblowers have contacted Labour with concerns that even the most serious 999 calls are being handled by private ambulances without properly trained staff and equipment.

'This is cost-cutting privatisation at
its crudest, with a real risk that patient safety will be compromised. 
Jeremy Hunt must provide urgent assurances about the quality and safety 
of these private services.'

On Wednesday the House of Lords will debate controversial rules which could open the health service up to more competition.

Mr Burnham said: 'This week, Labour will ask the Lords to call a halt to David Cameron's mad dash to privatise the NHS.

'He promised to let doctors decide but now is ordering them to open up the NHS to full commercial competition.

'The Prime Minister needs to be reminded that the British people have never given him permission to put their NHS up for sale.'

A spokesman for Mr Hunt said: 'Contracts to deliver patient transport are decided locally, and should be based on what is required to meet patient demand.

'As we know the NHS is seeing an extra one million more patients in A&E compared to two years ago and despite the additional workload it is coping well.

'Using a variety of healthcare providers to deliver patient transport services is a system which was started under the last Labour government but is an approach they now criticise.

'This rank hypocrisy shows the Labour party is more concerned with playing party politics than meeting the needs of patients.'
