A wearable computer than can track activity, download apps and even play games has been released.

However, while it may sound like the much awaited Apple iWatch, in fact the LeapBand is aimed at a very different audience - four to seven year olds.

The firm behind it says the gadget can help parents keep track of how much exercise their children are getting.

The $40 LeapBand has motion sensors built in, and connects to a special mobile phone app to allow parents to see how their children are doing on the activity based games.

The LeapBand has a built-in accelerometer, a high-resolution color screen, a rechargeable battery and water-resistant design.

It comes preloaded with 50 different activities and challenges, tracking a child's physical moves so the more active a child is, the more points they earn with their virtual pet

Activities include 'Walk like a crab, Spin like a helicopter and Pop like popcorn'.

There is also a free app that adds games to the system.

LeapFrog says the gadget will 'encourages active play and healthy habits while children nurture their very own personalized virtual pet.

It boasts a built-in accelerometer, a high-resolution color screen, a rechargeable battery and water-resistant design.

It comes preloaded with 50 different activities and challenges, tracking a child's physical moves so the more active a child is, the more points they earn with their virtual pet.

As the child earns points through active play, they can unlock additional games, challenges, levels of play and virtual rewards for their on-screen pet.

Dozens of games are included, and users can download more and unlock levels through a phone app

'We understand that helping a child reach their potential not only includes making sure they are versed on the ABCs and 123s but they are encouraged through play to establish healthy habits and get the exercise they need every day,' said Dr. Jody Sherman LeVos, director of LeapFrog's Learning Team.

'LeapBand is a great way to get kids up and active and help them develop a strong foundation for healthy lifestyles.

'LeapBand takes inspiration from the growing trend of adult fitness wearables and makes it perfect for kids by bringing the fun and play of physical activities to life with their very own virtual pets.'

The LeapBand activity tracker gets kids moving and having fun with 50 different activities and challenges, tracking a child's physical moves so the more active a child is, the more points they earn with their virtual pet.

The LeapBand is also available in a range of colours

The tracker comes with eight different customizable pets from LeapFrog's popular Pet Pals franchise – a cat, dog, dragon, monkey, panda, penguin, robot and unicorn – which can be customized by color and name.

Children can play 10 preloaded active games and challenges with access to 40 additional free challenges.

As they move and earn points, kids can unlock each of the additional eight pets and earn virtual toys for each of them as they stay engaged and learning with mini-games including Pet Boogie, Pet Chef and Pet Salon.

Activities include 'Walk like a crab, Spin like a helicopter and Pop like popcorn.

There is also a free app that adds games to the system.
