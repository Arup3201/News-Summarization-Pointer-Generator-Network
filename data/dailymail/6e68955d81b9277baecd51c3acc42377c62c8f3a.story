He is currently battling to win over a sceptical British public, not yet convinced of his ability to lead the nation.

But when Labour leader Ed Miliband met a 16-month-old baby today during a routine hospital visit, he would have expected to meet little resistance.

Unfortunately for the beleaguered Leader of the Opposition, things didn't go quite to plan.

Mr Miliband was being shown around the Royal Bolton's Hospital's
children's ward.

He was soon introduced to Carla Toner and her 
16-month-old son Marley Richardson in the ward playroom, where the 
youngster was recovering from tonsillitis.

But, despite being many years away from being able to cast his first vote, the youngster quickly made his feelings known.

As soon as he was handed over to Mr Miliband, the poorly baby burst into tears and writhed around in discomfort.

Despite trying his hardest to win over the tot, Mr Miliband was left with no choice but to hand him back over to his mother.

Following his little set-back with Marley, Mr Miliband soon got back onto comfortable ground, by attacking Prime Minister David Cameron.

During his visit, the Labour leader said the NHS would become the 'defining issue' at the next election.

He said Mr Cameron had broken 'solemn 
promises' at the last election to protect the NHS.

Mr Miliband told hospital staff: 'David Cameron hid his plans for the NHS from the British public at the last general election.

'Now we know they will divert 
billions of pounds from patient care to bureaucracy and lead to a 
creeping privatisation of the NHS.

'People didn't get a chance to vote for these plans at the last election.

'I'm determined to make it the defining issue at the next general election if David Cameron does not drop this Bill.

'These are his plans and he will be judged on them.

'These plans won't help to reform the NHS, they will damage the NHS.'

Mr Miliband said the British NHS was 
the 'envy of the world' but the Prime Minister had not been 'straight' 
with the public over his plans.

He added: 'If he doesn't drop the 
Bill, I will make it a defining issue in the next general election 
because I think these plans are dangerous.

'We are going to take this fight right up to the next election.'

It was also claimed today that MPs may not debate the Government's controversial health reforms on the floor of the Commons despite an e-petition calling for them to be scrapped reaching 140,000 signatures.

Under the Government's scheme, many 
signatories hope that by putting their name to an e-petition they can 
force MPs to debate the issue in the House of Commons.

But
Labour MP Natascha Engel, chairwoman of the Backbench Business 
Committee, said the amount of time allocated by the Government meant it 
was increasingly difficult to schedule debates on contentious issues 
such as NHS reform.

A number of rebel Liberal Democrats or dissenting Tory MPs would also have to back the Drop the Health Bill petition as her committee can only schedule debates with cross-party support, she said.

Ms Engel said she had 'big concerns' there would not be enough time to schedule a debate in the Commons.

She said: 'We have loads of different debates waiting for allocation. The Migration Watch debate still hasn't been scheduled.

'It's such a contentious issue and it's against the Government's position and it's the Government that allocates us time, so there is definitely a conflict of interests.'

Accusations: During his visit today, Ed Miliband said Mr Cameron, pictured, had broken 'solemn promises' at the last election to protect the NHS

The Government's website states any petition reaching 100,000 signatures 'could be debated' in the House of Commons, but this is not guaranteed.

The Procedure Committee has said all e-petitions reaching six figures will trigger a hearing at least in Westminster Hall, a much smaller annexe where MPs can hold debates which do not require a vote.

The Bill has also attracted opposition from health professionals and patients' groups, while there have been reports of deep unease among Tory Cabinet ministers and even Number 10 insiders about the legislation.

On Monday, Downing Street dismissed suggestions that its author, Andrew Lansley, should be sacked as Health Secretary and insisted ministers were 'fully behind' the reforms.

Mr Cameron is expected shortly to launch a new offensive to 'sell' the Bill to the public, saying at the weekend that he was 'at one' with Mr Lansley.

Today, Health minister Simon Burns hit back at Mr Miliband's claims the Tories had reneged on their pre-election promises.

He said: 'Ed Miliband can talk the NHS down all he likes, but the truth is that services are getting better all the time - with shorter waits since the election, 820,000 more people able to access an NHS dentist, 15,000 fewer administrators, 4,000 more doctors and 600 more midwives.

'Our plans deliver control for patients, power for doctors and nurses, and less bureaucracy. Labour still have no plan to help our NHS meet the challenges of the future. Their approach is simply one of cynical opportunism.'
