A homeless senior citizen snoozing at a Los Angeles bus stop early Thursday is in critical condition after a man fiendishly doused her with an alcoholic beverage and then inexplicably lit her defenseless body ablaze. 

Authorities soon-thereafter collared the 20-something-year-old assailant who apparently acted without provocation - and whose name had not yet been released Thursday afternoon pending his formal booking. 

'It was like when you pour gasoline on something -- like an explosion,' Erickson Ipina told NBC in Los Angeles of this latest bit of violence concering the 67-year-old woman set ablaze on Thursday.

The scene of the crime: A 67-year-old vagrant was sleeping about 1 a.m. Thursday morning at an L.A. bus stop when then vicious and senseless attack occurred

Fiend: Police collared a as-yet-unnamed 20-something-year-old suspect shortly after the attack took place Thursday

It is the second such incident to occur in Los Angeles in the last two weeks, in which a public vagrant was set aflame while sleeping after someone poured alcohol on their defenceless body.

A 55-year-old man reportedly remains in serious condition after being burned alive last week around the same time of day - 12:45 a.m. - as he slept in a sleeping bag outside a doughnut shop in southern Los Angeles County.

No one has yet been arrested in connection with that worrisome attack that concluded when passers-by heard the man's pain-filled screams and alerted the local fire department. 

That man was reportedly a familiar sight in the Norwalk nabe in which the attack occured, having passed his nights for years in the same area. 

Similarly, Ipina added he often saw the homeless lady involved in Thursday's incident strolling the very same Van Nuys neighborhood in which the heartless attack occurred about 1 a.m. outside a Walgreens drugstore.

Like an explosion: A Good Samaritan witness to the attack gave chase after the assailant - and even continued his pursuit after being threatened with a knife

Fighting for her life: The victim remains hospitalized in critical condition after the attack, and officials will soon reportedly transfer her to a local burn unit

Police told The Los Angeles Times witnesses saw the attacker exit the establishment, located at the intersection of Van Nuys Boulevard and Sherman Way, and pour a bottle-borne accelerant on the woman and then flick a lit match on to her sleeping form. 

Ipina, for his part, gave chase following the ghastly crime, and continued his pursuit even after the assailant brandished a knife.

 'He told me, 'Stop following me, or I will cut you. I kept following him and then the police came.'

'He told me, 'Stop following me, or I will cut you,' Ipina told NBC. 'I kept following him and then the police came.'

The Times reports Los Angeles is no stranger to such attacks, as homeless man John McGraham was killed in 2008 after a man similarly set him on fire in the Mid-Wilshire district of the city.

That assailant, who reportedly said he was fed up with that neighborhood's homelessness problem, was later convicted of first-degree murder, torture and arson.

The 67-year-old victim was was hospitalized in critical condition, and will likely be transported to a Sherman Oaks burn center for treatment, police reportedly said.
