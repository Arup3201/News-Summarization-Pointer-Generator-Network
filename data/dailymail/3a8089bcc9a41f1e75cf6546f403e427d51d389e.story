Richard Sherman isn't staying on the bench for the debate over Deflategate, saying that the Patriots will never see punishment because of the 'conflict of interest' between NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

Speaking to reporters Sherman said: 'I think the perception is the reality. It is what it is. Their résumé speaks for itself. The past is what the past is. Their present is what their present is. And, will they be punished? Probably not.

'Not as long as Robert Kraft and Roger Goodell are still taking pictures at their respective homes. He was just at Kraft’s house last week for the AFC Championship,' he continued. 'You talk about conflicts of interest.'

Sherman said: 'I think the perception is the reality. It is what it is. Their résumé speaks for itself. The past is what the past is. Their present is what their present is. And, will they be punished? Probably not.

The New York Post reported that Sherman said that with their relationship strong and open there would not be any repercussions. 

'But as long as that happens, it won't affect them at all,' he said. 'Nothing will, so....' 

However the Seahawk said he did not want to waste time worrying about how that friendship might affect the game.

'Not really. It is what it is at this point, whether it has impact or it doesn’t have impact,' he said. 'It is what it is.'

He did, however, believe fans might back the Seahawks over the scandal.

'I guess more people may be inclined to cheer for us just because people like to see history made,' he said. 'No matter who you are, no matter what you do, you’d like to witness history. I think that this has been a special season for us and a special season for them as well. … I guess the controversy makes it, I guess, probably gives us a little edge in that respect, I guess.'

The situation is an ironic reversal for Sherman, who was himself considered something of a bad guy headed into last year's game.

'Yes it is ironic, that I was a villain last year,' Sherman said, 'seeing as I didn’t break any rules or do anything despicable. I just play the game. To be painted a villain, you have to do something, I guess evil or something heinous, and I don’t know if I fit that description.'

Luckily, he can honestly say he hasn't caught any improperly inflated balls.

'No, I have not. Not to date,' he laughed.
