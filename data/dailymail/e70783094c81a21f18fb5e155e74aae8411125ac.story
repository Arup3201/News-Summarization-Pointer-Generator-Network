Eight-year-old Harry Flynn is a lifesaver to his little sister Isabelle - after giving her the kiss of life a staggering 22 times.

Little Isabelle, aged two, was born 12 weeks early and suffers with a condition called apnoea of  prematurity, which makes her stop breathing without warning.

But quick-thinking Harry has learned how to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation at the Red Cross Teddy Bears club and regularly steps in to keep his sister alive.

Harry has performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on her while watching TV, during visits to the supermarket and on family days out.

Proud Maria says she has 'no doubt' her little daughter would have died had it not been for her big brother.

Harry first came to the rescue when the family were watching television and Isabelle cried out before turning blue and falling unconscious.

Maria, 37, said: 'It all happened so fast and we were just thinking ‘oh my god, what’s happening.’

'She just turned blue, then purple, and she was unconscious. She was out cold. But Harry was so cool and calm. He just tapped her leg and called her name and when he got no response he just gave her two breaths and she came round and took an enormous breath.

'We couldn’t believe what we had just seen.'

Isabelle weighed just 2lbs when she was born at just 28 weeks and was in hospital for 10 weeks before she was able to come home, weighing just 5lbs.

She used to stop breathing a couple of times a week but now has an episode around once a month, although doctors say she will eventually grow out of the condition.

Apnoea of prematurity is the absence of spontaneous 
respiration.

It tends to occur in premature babies and occurs because the baby’s central nervous system is 
not fully developed when they are born.

Most
 babies can be roused from an apnoea episode simply by tapping or 
rubbing them to make them more alert, and most grow out of the condition as their 
body grows and develops.

Although apnoea usually resolves itself by the time most premature babies go home, a few will continue to have episodes.

In these cases, the baby will be discharged from the intensive care with an apnoea monitor.

The child may also need to take caffeine medication for a short time.

Harry learned his life-saving skills at the Red Cross Teddy Bears - a youth club he has attended every week since he was five years old.

He has saved his sister’s life in supermarkets, out on family trips and even dashes into her bedroom to revive her in her cot if she stops breathing in the middle of the night.

Isabelle has a sensor in her mattress that monitors her breathing and sounds an alarm if she stops breathing.

'Harry is always there first,' said Maria. 'He gets to her so fast and he is just so good at it.

'He is so calm and collected and mature beyond his years. He’s amazing - our own hero.'

Harry has also trained sister Molly, five, how to revive their little sister in case she ever stops breathing while he or his mum are not around.

Full-time mum Maria, who is also a Red Cross volunteer, said: “Once she stopped breathing while we were out shopping in Lidl.

'Before I knew it he had her up out of the trolley, he had to squat down on his knees and held her across his knees giving her breaths. He had to do it about six times.

'I have no doubt she would have died if it were not for Harry.

Harry said: 'In the night time, when I hear the [special breathing] alarm go off I run to Isabelle's room and shake her cot and then do a few breaths. I just like to help her'

'They have a really special bond. He absolutely idolises her and dotes on her. He’s a little mother hen really.'

But modest Harry - who says he 'just likes to help' - played down his hero status.

'The first time we were just watching telly and Isabelle went all blue and purple on her face,' he said.

'She stopped breathing. I tapped her on the foot twice and did two breaths and she came back.

'It was a little bit frightening at first but I know what to do.'

The toddler most recently stopped breathing last Monday - her second birthday - when the family were out at the amusements.

'She was in a little car and she didn’t want to get out so she started crying and then she held her breath in and she went,” he Harry, of Waterford, Ireland.

'I just shook her and gave her some breaths in her mouth.

'In the night time when I hear the alarm I run to her room and shake her cot and then do a few breaths. I just like to help her.'

Staff at the Irish Red Cross - which runs the TeddyBears club - said they were very proud of Harry’s heroic actions.

Darren Ryan, chairman of the Irish Red Cross Youth working group, added: 'It is extremely important to see that the courses that we provide, to our youth members and to the public, are effective in that they benefit the wider community.

'Harry’s heroic actions show that first aid training for young people really can make a difference. It also shows the capability of our youth members.

'We couldn’t be prouder of Harry and his story strengthens the Irish Red Cross belief that it is imperative that we offer this kind of training to young people.'

Apnoea is the absence of spontaneous respiration. When it happens in premature babies it is called apnoea of prematurity and can happen because the baby’s central nervous system is not fully developed when they are born.

Most babies can be roused from an apnoea episode simply by tapping or rubbing them to make them more alert, and will grow out of it as their body grows.
