It could have been a scene from Footballers’ Wives: an unexpected knock on the door forces a veteran Arsenal defender with 117 England caps to hide next to the Hoover in a dark cupboard and wait, heart-in-mouth, for a chance to escape while pleasantries are exchanged outside.

But this isn’t yet another tawdry tale of an overpaid, badly behaved Premier League player.

Indeed, the indignity of the situation was not lost on England women’s football star Casey Stoney. At the age of 25, she literally found herself ‘in the closet’, because her then-girlfriend was too scared to let her visiting family know she was in a same-sex relationship.

Indeed, for much of her early life Casey, now 32, suffered anxiety about being homosexual and was often in denial about her feelings.

‘For many years I felt isolated and scared,’ she says. 

‘I’ve even pretended to have boyfriends; all because I was afraid of being rejected by society.’

It was only her strong desire to start a family that finally spurred the England player to come out publicly last February.

As one of the women’s game’s biggest stars – she was England captain until this year and led the GB side in the London 2012 Olympics – Casey says she was also inspired by diver Tom Daley, who made an emotional revelation last December that he was in a relationship with a man.

Even so, she braced herself for a backlash when she announced three months ago that she and her pregnant fiancee, Megan Harris, a former team-mate, are expecting twins in November.

The response was overwhelmingly positive, with congratulations from Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and comedian Matt Lucas among many others.

It’s a sign, she suggests, that Britain is becoming more accepting.

Internet trolls, however, did question their right to have a child without a father. 

‘They seemed to suggest we were doing something unnatural,’ Casey says.

‘But what does a normal family look like? As long as children have the love and support they need, it shouldn’t matter whether they are brought up by two mums, two dads or one of each.’

A willowy brunette, Casey is more guarded than her shorter, more vivacious blonde partner. But she is resolute in her desire to go public: ‘We think it’s important for people to be proud of who they are. It’s not going to be a secret.

‘We want our kids to know the truth from day one and to grow up proudly knowing they are loved and wanted by a family unit with two mummies.

‘Society now is not what it was 20 or 30 years ago. Why is it so important to have one mother and one father? It’s about being with people who love and care for you.

‘Many children now come from single parent households. I grew up with my mum as my constant and my dad around only at weekends. 

'Our children will have heavy male presence from both sets of extended families and friends.’

Casey says speaking out has been difficult given her history of hiding her own sexuality.

Before she met Megan at Lincoln Ladies football club in 2011, Casey says her relationships always felt like ‘a dirty secret’.

And although she insists she is not a spokeswoman for lesbian rights, she adds: ‘I felt it was important for me to speak out when so many people still struggle with being gay.

‘Some teenagers kill themselves out of despair. But it’s not freaky or unnatural, it’s a matter of fact that some people unfortunately find difficult to accept.’

Describing herself as a talker, emotional, impulsive and driven, Casey insists that the apparently more laid-back Megan is ‘as steady as a ship’ and ‘wears the trousers’.

Certainly, the heavily pregnant blonde has an easy confidence fostered by her family’s full support when she came out at university.

The same cannot be said about Casey, whose childhood in Basildon, Essex, was marked by poverty and self-loathing.

Her parents divorced over her father’s gambling addiction when she was seven, leaving her mother to work three jobs to make ends meet. Casey says her school shoes were lined with cardboard and her football boots were second-hand.

At 15, Casey realised she was ‘different’ from her female friends.

‘I had crushes on boys and even had a boyfriend at school, but I never really felt the physical attraction. I didn’t feel it for girls either, but I felt something inside me wasn’t right.’

Football was her salvation. ‘I could lose myself during training and games,’ she says.

‘Then one day I realised that I was too curious about a girl on my team who was gay. When I saw her with her partner it appealed to me.

‘I was 17 and suddenly I knew I was gay. But it frightened me.

‘I didn’t want to act on it. I was basically terrified that people would no longer love me.’

Casey said she was inspired by diver Tom Daley, who posted a video on YouTube in December last year in which he revealed that he was in a relationship with a man

A year later she found the courage to tell her parents. Her mother took a little time to accept the news, but her father didn’t bat an eyelid. 

And yet Casey’s love life remained in the shadows, with partners who also feared exposure. 

‘It’s only since meeting Megan that I’ve felt loved and secure,’ she says.

After a year together they decided to try for a family using an anonymous sperm donor.

Megan’s eggs were used because her desire to give birth was greater. After three rounds of IVF, costing £15,000 at a London clinic, Casey announced the pregnancy in her column for the BBC sports website.

She says she has had ‘incredible support’ inside the game, including from several male professionals. She believes many sports stars fear declaring their sexuality, and says it is easier for women players to come out as gay than men. 

‘It’s a massive step. The fear of what fans can do keeps them quiet. The language from the stands can be very brutal.’

It is, she argues, probably easier to be a gay woman footballer.

‘We don’t get abuse hurled at us from the terraces. Our profile is not as big as the men and we don’t have the kind of commercial success, with all the business obligations that entails.’

Nevertheless, Casey is anxious not to reinforce the stereotype that all women footballers are gay.

The percentage, she believes, is probably around 30 to 40 per cent, which she explains by suggesting it is harder for women to stay in the game if they have children.

It is an issue she hopes to highlight as the first woman to join the Professional Footballers’ Association committee.

Meanwhile, she is – at last – feeling good about herself. ‘Knowing I was going to be a mum made me more accepting of myself and gave me the strength to go public, she says.

‘I had to be honest and transparent for the sake of my children. They will be strong and proud of who their mothers are. Hopefully, by the time they grow up, lesbians with children will be less of an issue.

‘Perhaps, 20 years from now, they will walk down the road and see same-sex couples holding hands and no one will bat an eyelid.’
