A North Carolina gambler has been arrested after he allegedly flushed $2.7 million worth of fake poker chips down the toilet at an Atlantic City hotel room, clogging the pipes.

Christian Lusardi, 42, of Fayetteville, had been using the counterfeit chips during the Winter Poker Open's 'Big Stack, No Limit Hold 'Em' event at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, police said.

But, days into the tournament, officials wised up to his game, and he attempted to dispose of the evidence by flushing the chips, unsuccessfully, at Harrah's Resort and Casino.

Lusardi's stash clogged the sewer pipes, prompting the hotel to notify Borgata officials who contacted New Jersey police.

Officers found Lusardi Friday at a motel in Atlantic City and he was arrested over the weekend.

Police said Lusardi introduced the counterfeit chips into the tournament on multiple occasions.

He won a total of $6,814 during the competition, CNN reported.

The competition began in mid-January, but late last week officials discovered $800,000 of the imposter chips - 160 chips worth $5,000 each - among the genuine casino chips.

The counterfeit chips forced officials to suspend the event for 24 hours. Soon after, the tournament was canceled.

'This was a very unusual occurrence. It's the first time in Borgata's 10 years that anything like this has happened,' Joe Lupo, senior vice president of operations at Borgata, told CNN.

'We are very pleased that the New Jersey State Police Casino Gaming Bureau has apprehended a suspect,' Lupo said.

'While this is a very positive development, the investigation by the Division of Gaming Enforcement and the State Police is ongoing.'

Lusardi was charged with rigging a publicly exhibited contest, criminal attempt, and theft by deception.

He was being held on $300,000 bail, with no option to pay 10 per cent, at the Atlantic City Jail, police said.

More than 4,800 hopefuls enrolled in the poker tournament and when it was canceled Friday, 27 people remained in the game.
