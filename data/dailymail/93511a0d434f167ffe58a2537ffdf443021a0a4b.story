Fatima
 Ahmed always ensured that her daughter had not one, but two asthma 
inhalers at primary school. Saarah was diagnosed with severe asthma at 
just three months old, and her mother knew how quickly her attacks could
 escalate, and that she needed her inhaler within seconds.

When
 Saarah was 11, she had an asthma attack just as the school day was 
finishing. Fatima wasn't worried, as she knew she'd immediately be able 
to get one of inhalers - one was kept in reception, and the other in her
 daughter's classroom.

'I
 came to pick Saarah up from school and knew straight away that she was 
at the beginning of an attack,' recalls Fatima, 36, a full-time mother, 
who lives with her husband Parvez, 41, a shop manager, Saarah, now 13, 
and son Deen, ten, in London.

'She was pale and blotchy, and I could hear her wheezing. She'd been too shy to say anything to her teacher.'

What
 Saarah needed was her reliever inhaler - these usually come in a blue 
container and contain salbutamol, which quickly relaxes the muscles 
surrounding the narrowed airways to make breathing easier (this is 
different from preventer inhalers, taken daily, which contain low-dose 
steroids to build up protection by reducing long-term inflammation in 
the airways).

Fatima
 asked for the inhaler kept at reception. But renovation works meant the
 inhaler had been locked in a cupboard for safekeeping. The deputy head 
had a key, but she'd gone home.

Saarah's
 wheezing was getting worse. Fatima asked the receptionist to fetch the 
second inhaler from her classroom. Thirty minutes later, he returned and
 said it was nowhere to be found.

By
 this point, someone had alerted the deputy head, who'd returned to 
school to unlock the cupboard and get the other inhaler, but Saarah was 
now struggling to breathe.

'I always remain outwardly very calm as it keeps Saarah calm, but inside I felt a rising panic,' says Fatima.

'Her
 wheezing had become severe and I knew she needed to get to hospital 
because it's happened many times before. It's five minutes away, so I 
drove her there. She was treated in A&E and then transferred to 
intensive care, where she had asthma drugs through an intravenous line.'

Saarah's inhalers weren't accessible

She
 adds that Saarah spent the next four days in hospital. She went 
straight back to school when she came out, but had to take it easy and 
her dose of oral steroids was temporarily increased.

It's
 a common story, says the charity Asthma UK. A child has an asthma 
attack at school and needs their inhaler, but for some reason it's not 
accessible.

Secondary school children can carry their own inhalers, but even that doesn't guarantee access.

'A
 worrying 86 per cent of children say they have been without their own 
inhaler because they have forgotten, lost, broken or run out of it,' 
says Kay Boycott, the charity's chief executive.

The
 ideal solution would be for schools to hold a spare emergency inhaler 
in their first-aid kits, but it's illegal to do so because it's a 
prescription-only medication.

With
 one in 11 UK children having asthma, it's a pressing issue. Asthma UK 
has been campaigning since 2011 to get the law changed to allow schools 
to hold a spare inhaler.

As
 Kay Boycott explains: 'The equivalent of a classroom of children die 
because of asthma every year. We know it could really make a difference 
because more than two-thirds of children with asthma in the UK have had 
an attack while at school.'

The
 school environment has many potential triggers for an asthmatic child, 
adds Deborah Waddell, a clinical lead nurse for the charity.

These
 include exercise during PE lessons or break time, sudden changes in 
temperature (going from a warm classroom to a cold playground), 
exam/test stress, and wood dust or glues from woodwork lessons. 
Prescription-only medication can only be administered to a named person,
 which has prevented schools from carrying a spare - as the drugs 
watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency points
 out, this also applies to adrenaline injections known as EpiPens, which
 are administered during severe allergic reactions.

Asthma
 UK wants an exemption to this rule for schools, allowing them to 
administer an inhaler to any child registered as asthmatic who has a 
parental consent form signed in advance.

'Reliever
 inhalers have a standard dosage and there would be clear guidance about
 when and how the spare inhaler should be used,' explains Deborah 
Waddell.

'There
 is no danger, however, if an inhaler is used unnecessarily - the worst 
that can happen is some shakiness and an increased heart rate, but this 
soon passes and causes no harm.'

Fourteen-year-old Alex Birch, from 
Harrogate, N. Yorks, carries his inhaler with him, as he needs to use it
 at least three times a week, especially during winter and the pollen 
season, as the cold and pollen are two of his triggers.

'But
 one day last year, I left it by the side of the football pitch during 
PE and forgot to pick it up after the lesson,' he says.

'I went back to retrieve it as soon as I remembered, but someone had trodden on it and it was in pieces.'

That lunchtime, Alex played football with his friends. 'I didn't want to sit inside and be a misery,' he says.

'After
 a few minutes, though, I started feeling really breathless and knew it 
could lead to an attack. I would usually have had a puff on my inhaler, 
but I couldn't, so I stopped straight away and managed to get my 
breathing under control by staying calm and taking long, deep breaths.

'It
 could have been a lot worse.Â  I felt so panicky that I didn't have my 
inhaler. Having an asthma attack is terrifying - it's like having a plug
 in your throat and you can't breathe in - and the thought that I 
couldn't access the medicine that can save my life made me really 
anxious.

'It's
 my responsibility to carry my inhaler now that I'm in secondary school,
 but I've misplaced it more than once as I have so many bags and books 
to remember.

Saarah was treated in A&E and then transferred to intensive care, where she had asthma drugs

'I
 wish that my school was allowed to have an emergency inhaler, and I 
think they wish they could, too! I know several people at school who've 
been without their inhaler at some point, and once had to lend mine to a
 boy who'd left his at home.'

A
 lack of a spare inhaler in school can have tragic consequences. 
Eight-year-old Olivia Chandler died after having an asthma attack in 
school in October 2010.

Her
 mother Teresa was called to bring in a spare inhaler, but by the time 
she arrived, the school had called an ambulance and Olivia was on the 
floor being given CPR by the paramedics. It was too late to save her.

'Things
 might have been very different for Olivia if the school had been able 
to keep an emergency inhaler on site,' says Teresa, 34, from High 
Wycombe.

During
 an asthma attack, two main things happen, explains Dr Andrew 
Menzies-Gow, consultant in respiratory medicine at Royal Brompton 
Hospital, London.

'The
 airways become inflamed and can become clogged with extra mucus, and 
the muscles of the airways spasm, causing them to narrow. If left 
untreated, this can lead to the airways becoming completely blocked, 
causing a fatal attack.

'A
 reliever inhaler can have an instant effect and prevent the attack from
 progressing to status asthmaticus, a stage where the airways becomes 
unresponsive to the reliever inhaler and the person needs hospital 
intervention.'

Every
 second counts once a child starts having an attack, adds Deborah 
Waddell. 'The school could call an ambulance, but that takes time and 
could be prevented if the child has guaranteed access to an inhaler at 
all times.'

The
 good news is that the Government is expected to announce a consultation
 on the issue soon, which could lead to a change in the law. This could 
happen as soon as October, in time for the winter cough and cold season -
 a trigger for many asthmatics.

For
 the Chandler family this is welcome news. Olivia's sister, Nicole, 
five, also has asthma - 'she understands what happened to her sister,' 
says her father Darren.

'She
 has an inhaler in her classroom, but I would feel much more at ease if I
 knew there was also a spare inhaler on site in case of emergencies. If 
this campaign can save just one child's life, it will have been a huge 
success.'

Asthma
 UK would like anyone with experience of being without an inhaler in 
school to tell their story during the government consultation. Go to:
