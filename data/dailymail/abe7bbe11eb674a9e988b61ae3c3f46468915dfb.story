Rugby league is mourning the death of Australian half-back Greg Mackey, who captained Hull to Premiership success in 1991 and also played in England for Warrington and Huddersfield.

Mackey, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in December 2011, suffered a heart attack and passed away at his home in Sydney on Wednesday at the age of 52, the Warrington club announced.

A statement said: 'Warrington Wolves were sad to learn of the passing of former captain Greg Mackey on Wednesday 24 September at the age of 52.'

Mackey also played for Warrington in two different spells between 1989-90 and 1992-96

Mackey began his career at South Sydney in 1980 and also played for Illawarra Steelers and Canterbury before moving to England in 1989.

He made just nine appearances for Warrington before receiving a lucrative offer from Hull, where as captain and stand-off, he won the Harry Sunderland Trophy as man of the match as the Airlie Birds beat Warrington 14-4 in the 1990-91 Premiership final at Old Trafford.

After making 94 consecutive appearances for Hull, Mackey returned to Warrington in the summer of 1992 and went on to make 98 consecutive appearances for them, which is still a club record, and played in their 24-0 defeat by the touring Kangaroos at Wilderspool in 1994.

Mackey, who also spent the winter of 1983-84 playing in France for Paris Chatillon XIII, finished his career at Huddersfield in 1996, the first season of Super League, before returning with his family to Sydney, where he worked in the telecoms industry.

He leaves a wife Amanda, three children, Kane, Ebony and Tom, and identical twin granddaughters.
