A newly uncovered Star Trek spoof video filmed at a training facility for a California nuclear power plant has sparked concerns that plant employees boldly went to the final frontier of inappropriate behavior.

The video, which was reportedly produced in 2010 and has workers from San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS), in various roles from the iconic science fiction franchise.

There's even a Mr Spock character, complete with the Vulcan's upward-slanted eyebrows and pointy ears.

The plant, located in Pendleton, was shut down in 2012 following a radiation leak, according to reports.

The spoof stars former plant manager Ross Ridenoure playing the Captain Kirk character, 10News reported. Current vice president and plant manager Doug Bouder stars as Ridenoure's commander.

Ridenoure no longer works at the plant, 
and has since taken a position with a company in the Middle East.

It was not known whether he had been fired from SONGS or if he had quit.

A spokeswoman for Southern California 
Edison, which owns the plant, told 10News that the video, dubbed SONGS 
Trek, cost about $800 to make and was never finished nor approved for 
public viewing.

A source at the plant, who did not wish to be identified, told the station: 'Supposedly it was for training. How that fits in and how good that works for training, your guess is as good as mine.'

The man added: The plant runs by public trust and right now, the public is blind.

Ridenoure did not respond to
10Newsâ€™ request for comment.

The station showed the video to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who concluded that making a video did not put anyone at risk.
