'We have a target': Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said immigration is a key issue

David Cameron’s hopes of cutting immigration from Europe were dealt a blow after figures showed a surge in the number of North Africans trying to enter the EU through Italy.

The continental border agency estimates the total has already hit 60,000 this year. Even more have arrived than in 2011, the year of revolutions that became known as the Arab Spring.

Once migrants have been accepted into Italy, they can then travel easily throughout the EU.

Yesterday Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers are well aware of public concern over the fact that Britain has  ‘virtually no control over’ immigration from the EU.

Mr Javid said the Conservatives are determined to ‘change’ the rules as part of the renegotiation of Britain’s membership promised by Mr Cameron. He stressed that the Prime Minister’s pledge to reduce net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the time of the election remains in place, despite a recent surge that has taken the number back over 200,000.

Mr Javid said: ‘We’ve set a target and that remains in place. It hasn’t changed. We do recognise that we, as a country today, have much more control over non-EU immigration – and we have virtually no control over EU immigration.

'That’s something that we’d like to change, but that is much easier said than done at this point and requires renegotiating with our European partners and that’s something Conservatives are committed to.’

Mr Javid, the son of a Pakistani immigrant, told Total Politics magazine: ‘When I was campaigning in the 2010 election, a number of people on the doorstep would raise the issue of immigration with you, not in a “for or against” way, just concerns about the numbers.

'That’s a legitimate issue. If that’s what people are concerned about, politicians do need to listen and they do need to react.’

Crisis: Around 250 migrants from Sub-Saharian areas are hosted on a landing craft of Italy's Navy ship San Giorgio after being rescued in open international waters in the Mediterranean last week

Home Secretary Theresa May signalled this week that she backs curbs on free movement of migrants.

Yesterday, former prime minister Sir John Major said the success of Eurosceptic parties across Europe meant Mr Cameron had allies. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘The results of these elections have made a renegotiation much easier.

‘It is apparent to governments right across Europe that reform of the EU is necessary, it isn’t working as it should, it isn’t working in the way European citizens think it should.’

Sir John said many people are ‘grinding their teeth’ in frustration at Brussels. But he warned that leaving the EU would ‘cost us billions’.

He backed Mr Cameron’s plan to hold an In/Out referendum in 2017 following an attempted renegotiation. ‘I do believe the Prime Minister will win this referendum,’ he said. ‘There will be significant things that can be renegotiated.’
