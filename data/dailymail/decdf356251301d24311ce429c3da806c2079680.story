Four daughters are in a stand-off with a Catholic cemetery which refused to have their mother's year of death put on the family headstone - because her ashes are not buried under it.

Rita Sztukowski died aged 82 last April and her family had her cremated, splitting the remains among her children and grandchildren and placing them in jewellery.

But when they asked to complete the family stone they have had since 1955 at the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Cudahy, Wisconsin - which already bore her name and year of birth - the director refused.

Unholy row: The family of Rita Sztukowski (right and left with her daughter Shelley Blackwood) cannot engrave the year of her death into a headstone on the Catholic family plot because her ashes were not buried under it

No closure: The headstone on the family plot which has existed since 1955, where Rita Sztukowski was supposed to be memorialised next to her husband, Norbert. Her daughter Shelley called the spat 'ridiculous'

Instead of the year 2013 engraved next to the details of several other relatives, including her husband Norbert's, there is a large white space.

The cemetery's boss told them it was against tradition to recognise a burial unless all the remains are buried together in the plot.

Shelley Blackwood, 48 - one of Rita's four daughters - told MailOnline: 'We don't want her to be in the cold ground. It's hard for us because we live all across the U.S. and we just want her close to us.'

Mrs Blackwood, who lives 500 miles away in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, added: 'My sisters and I aren't Catholic any more and we don't know the rules of the church.

'But my mother said "throw me in the tomatoes - maybe I'll be good for the garden.' She wouldn't have cared.

'We had the funeral for her last May so this has gone on for almost a year. The way he has handled this is ridiculous.

Paying tribute: Daughters Pam, Sue, Holly and Shelley at the headstone last year after their mother's cremation

Argument: How the headstone looks now. The incomplete section for Rita can be seen bottom right

'The cemetery is very special to us and it's where our father used to take us as a place of peace, so going there and seeing those numbers missing makes it very hard to grieve.'

The daughters' original plan was to bury the ashes as the 26,000-plot cemetery would have wanted, but they changed their minds.

To help ease the row they engraved 'In cherished memory' above the name, but were still not allowed to complete the work, they said.

Their family plot is home to the remains of five relatives, including Rita's husband Norbert, his parents and two others.

Butch Miller, the cemetery's director, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: 'If you let this go, then what's next? "Oh, I want to have a statue of Satan on the cemetery grounds. I want 
the crucifix upside down. I want the Virgin Mary with a dagger in her 
womb." What's next?

Row: The strictly Catholic Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Cuhady, Wisconsin, has around 26,000 plots

He added: 'Our policy is on Christian burial beliefs, and when we have a person who has been cremated and they wish to have those cremated remains whole and buried at our cemetery, that is the only way we'll recognise.'

Cremation has long been controversial among Catholics, who see the body as a temple of the human spirit which should not be destroyed after death.

Early Christians associated burning a body with paganism, and until recently it was banned completely by the Catholic Church.

The Vatican lifted its all-out ban on cremations in 1963 and from 1997, cremated remains were given the same respect as remains in a casket at funerals.

However, the church still forbids scattering ashes or keeping them separate or at home.
