Alastair Cook  paid the price for his miserable form by being dumped as England one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup.

And here is how the world of Twitter and beyond reacted to the news on Friday. 

Alastair Cook's miserable form saw him sacked as England's one-day captain on Friday

MICHAEL VAUGHAN @MichaelVaughan

'Right call made by England... Now I hope Cook can have a good break and then come back in the summer as the Test player we know he can be...'

ALEC STEWART @StewieCricket

'However long it may take tough decisions are generally the correct ones & the England selectors have got it right in turning to Eoin Morgan.'

JONATHAN AGNEW @Aggerscricket

'And as for Cook, should be the best thing to happen for him. Have a break, don’t touch a bat for a while then come back strong for the Tests.'

MIKE ATHERTON

'It's the right decision. Alastair can now focus on Test matches and batting at the top of the order. It is absolutely right that we have split captains. It's not possible for one man to do both.' 

PIERS MORGAN @piersmorgan

'Cook fired? Good, right decision. Is @KP24 back? If not, why not? #england'

SIMON HUGHES @theanalyst

'Cook decision actually no brainer though feel very sorry for him as he gave it everything. What is good is Gary Balance in squad. Top player.'

BOB WILLIS

'He will be devastated. He is a proud man and a proud captain. The selectors are happy with his ability but it has got more and more embarrassing. Ian Bell has been sitting out there Alastair has had to tell him "I'm playing, not you". Eoin Morgan is in worse form than Cook so that is a tough decision as well.'

ALEX TUDOR @alextudorcoach

'Happy that Cooky now gets a rest & spends sometime with the family & away from the press pressure, if we are to have any chance in the Ashes.'

GARY LINEKER @GaryLineker

'Wish Alastair Cook well. Seems a good bloke and a terrific batsman, who may well blossom again without the burden that captaincy can be. Whilst the ECB reassess, they may as well go the whole hog and pick our finest batsman. Fresh start, lessons learnt, and all that.'
