This is the moment a baby elephant is rescued from a treacherous river after struggling to keep its head above the water.

The animals were crossing the swollen Ewaso Nyiro river in Kenya when the calf was almost swept downstream.

But rather than leave the youngster behind, its mother and another elephant quickly stepped in to rescue the stricken calf.

The mother then uses her trunk to free the baby and guide it to safety.

The calf makes it on to dry land on the other side of the water and continues on its way.

The images were captured on camera by Sandy Gelderman, who was staying at a luxury camp in central Kenyaâ€™s Ol Pejeta Conservancy.
