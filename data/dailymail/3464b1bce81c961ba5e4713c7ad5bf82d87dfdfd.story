The Prime Minister says Australian extremists linked with terror organisations 'hate us' and will try to return 'accustomed to kill'.

Tony Abbott has explained that, so far, no Australian troops have been committed to the crisis in northern Iraq but has not ruled out the possibility. 

'Australia cannot leave the Iraqi people to face this horror, this pure evil, alone,' Mr Abbott said.

The Prime Minister has not ruled out Australian ground forces being deployed in northern Iraq, suggesting if the call was made for military action by the US, that would be assessed against certain criteria

The US President Barack Obama has authorised air strikes against Islamist militants in Iraq,  if they are deemed necessary to stop the advance of extremists in northern Iraq

'So far, Australian aircraft have participated in humanitarian air drops to people trapped on Mount Sinjar and just yesterday to the besieged inhabitants of the town of Amerli.'

The next stage will include the air-lift of of supplies 'including military equipment' to the Kurdish military. 

'This involvement has been at the request of the Obama administration,' Mr Abbott confirmed. 

'So far we have met requests for humanitarian relief and for logistical support.

'There has been no request for military action itself. Should such a request come it would be considered against these criteria.

'Is there a clear and achievable overall objective? Is there a clear and proportionate role for Australian forces? Have all the risks been property assessed and is there an overall humanitarian objective in accordance with Australia's national interests?.' 

Mr Abbott went on to say that 'Australia has no intention to commit combat troops on the ground but we are not inclined to stand by in the face of preventable genocide either'.

'Australia is not a country that goes looking for trouble but Australia is prepared to do what we can in the wider world. This conflict is reaching out to us.

'At least 60 Australians are fighting with terrorist groups across Iraq and Syria. They are supported by about 100 more and we know, or should assume that many of them will seek to return to Australia 

'They will return accustomed to kill.

'The Australians and their supporters who have joined terrorist groups in the Middle East are a serious and growing threat to our security.

'They have come to hate us no less than they hate their victims in Iraq and Syria.'
