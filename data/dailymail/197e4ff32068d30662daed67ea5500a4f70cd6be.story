They say the best way to a man's heart is through his stomach... and the old adage has certainly been proven true by one foodie couple.

Stephanie Smith's boyfriend Eric loves her sandwiches so much he promised he'd propose marriage to her once she had made him 300. And with only 124 wraps, pittas, burgers and baguettes to go, she's getting pretty close.

And Eric, who has been dating Stephanie for two years, can't go back on his word: the savvy Brooklyn-based writer has been chronicling her efforts in a colourful gastronomic blog, 300sandwiches, in which she provides daily recipes, witty anecdotes and tempting photographs of her creations.

Stephanie Smith's blog 300sandwiches.com chronicles her bread-buttering tactic to get what she wants - marriage - by making her boyfriend Eric 300 sarnies

Now, more than halfway through her bread-based challenge, Stephanie has just revealed her previously secret identity, and disclosed that her time spent not making sarnies is actually spent as a reporter on the New York Post.

Despite a telling-off by gossip website Gawker, who say Stephanie is 'deranged' and must have 'lost her goddamn mind' to be bowing to the stringent demands of her bossy boyfriend - he won't eat sliced avocado, broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, anything with the word 'sprouts' in it, cauliflower, raw tomatoes, peas, kale, blueberries, raisins or olives - Stephanie continues to defend her behaviour.

Sandwich number 19, made on 18 August 18, was a prime rib steak ciabatta with caramelised onions and rocket

She says: 'Some might say the idea is sexist. I say come over for dinner, and watch E whip up roasted duck breast with a balsamic and currant sauce with a roasted parsnip puree and shaved pickled beets in no time, and you'll see who spends more time in the kitchen.

Sandwich number 175 was fried green tomatoes with feta and pesto

'Some say I’m just desperate to get engaged. Hardly. I don't have to be. E didn't say "cook me 300 sandwiches or I’m leaving you", he gave me a challenge - a dare, to some degree - and the type-A, Tracy Flick side of me can't stand being challenged.

'When I reach my 300th sandwich, I’ll have an arsenal of meals I can use for dinner, parties, picnics,  breakfast and desserts.

'And barring any major fights or infidelities, E and I will likely go all the way, buy that country house and have babies, so I'll need to know how to cook a variety of meals for my kids and house guests anyway.'

Writing in the Post, Stephanie explained the reasons behind the challenge that has led to her spending the past few months whipping up lobster rolls, Vietnamese bánh mìs, pulled pork buns, smoked salmon and scrambled egg bagels, grilled cheese toasties, fried courgette and tomato on a pretzel roll, French toast with banana and strawberry jam and roast chicken with sweet potato mash clubs, all for her hungry beau.

She said: 'Eric is the gourmet cook in our relationship, but he'd always want me to make him a sandwich.

'To him, sandwiches are like kisses or hugs. Or sex. "Sandwiches are love," he says. "Especially when you make them. You can't get a sandwich with love from the deli."

On her blog, Stephanie elaborates: 'I realised what it would take to get him to commit after the first time I made him a turkey on whole wheat bread, with mustard, lettuce and Swiss cheese.

'"Honey, this is the best sandwich ever!" he exclaimed in between bites so rapid in succession,  the sandwich was gone in minutes. And then, he dropped a bomb me: "You’re, like, 300 sandwiches away from an engagement ring."

'That was it - a proposal hinged on me making him sandwiches.'

Stephanie provides recipes for each of her creations on her blog, as well as little anecdotes as to where the inspiration behind each sarnie came from

And so, each week, from Monday to Friday, Stephanie makes Eric a sandwich. She has even been known to make one for his breakfast, one for his lunch and one for his dinner. In order to speed things along.

Some people were dubious about the scheme, particularly some of her single friends who believed the idea of slaving over a cold butter knife for the sake of a ring was deliriously old-fashioned and anti-feminist.

One pal called her a 'Stepford wife', another said: 'It's not 1950! It's chauvinistic! He's saying, "Cook for me, woman, and maybe I'll make you my wife."'

Some of the sandwiches made were savoury, but others - such as this 'throat-soothing' ice cream sandwich with Graham Crackers - were for times when a sweet sarnie was required

The problem Stephanie's own mother had with the idea was that her daughter cannot cook.

Defending her light-hearted blog, Stephanie says: '300 Sandwiches tracks the journey between two people in love as they share experiences and emotions through food.

'The blog chronicles our adventures, arguments, holidays, special times and average days over the course of 300 sandwiches.

'I will learn how to cook amazing food, we will learn more about each other, and hopefully my boyfriend will make good on his promise.'
