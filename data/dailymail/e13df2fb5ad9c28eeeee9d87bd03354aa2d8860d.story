South Korean 
officials tricked journalists into chasing a bogus renegade soldier as 
the real fugitive was rushed to hospital after trying to kill himself, 
it emerged today.

The ploy 
was used because the fugitive, who allegedly killed five colleagues and 
wounded several more before going on the run, needed quick medical 
treatment.

It was feared a media scrum would have caused a delay, said an unnamed Defence Ministry source.

Decoy: A stand-in poses as the rogue South Korean soldier who killed five comrades then shot himself

Trick: The ploy was used because the fugitive, who allegedly killed five colleagues and wounded several more before going on the run, needed quick medical treatment, said a Defence Ministry official

He told the Associated Press two 
ambulances were used, one carrying the injured fugitive and the other 
with another soldier whose body and face were covered by a blanket.

Cluelesss
 photographers took hundreds of pictures of the decoy as he was carried 
into the hospital in the eastern city of Gangneung.

Meanwhile,
 the ambulance carrying the real fugitive entered the hospital through 
its basement, said the Defence Ministry official who requested 
anonymity.

He said it wasn't
 clear if military personnel at the hospital had directly lied to dozens
 of journalists waiting there. But he said the personnel apparently 
deceived journalists into mistaking the stand-in for the fugitive.

The ministry admitted the ruse after speculation from South Korean media that a stand-in had been used.

The
 official said the decoy was asked for by hospital staff. But a public 
affairs official at GangNeung Asan Hospital denied that, saying a 
hospital official only asked about using a decoy ambulance.

The
 hospital spokesman said the hospital wasn't aware that a stand-in was 
being used. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with 
office policy.

A platoon leader was wounded trying to approach the man, named only as Yim, after he threw grenades

Troops had surrounded Yim in a forest about four miles from the border outpost and threw him a mobile phone so he could talk to his father

The 22-year-old sergeant surnamed Yim fled after allegedly killing five colleagues and wounding seven others on Saturday.

He
 is accused of firing at troops chasing him on Sunday, injuring a 
platoon leader. He shot himself on Monday before being captured, 
according to the Defence Ministry.

Troops
 had surrounded Yim in a forest about four miles from the border outpost
 and threw him a mobile phone so he could talk to his father.

Yim's parents also used a loudspeaker to try to persuade him to surrender.

It
 was not clear what triggered the rampage and there was no indication 
that North Korea, South Korea's bitter rival, was involved.

Yim
 was due to complete his nearly two years of mandatory military service 
in September, according to defence officials.

Initial personality tests 
last April put him within a group of soldiers who needed special 
attention and were unfit for frontline duty, a Defence Ministry official
 said.

But tests last November concluded that he had improved and could 
serve in the frontline area.

The
 rampage comes as South Koreans grapple with worries over public safety 
in the wake of an April ferry disaster that left more than 300 people 
dead or missing.

And some in
 Seoul have raised questions about the discipline and readiness of South
 Korea's military, which is under near-constant threat from a North 
Korea that has recently staged a series of missile and artillery drills,
 traded fire with the South near a disputed maritime border and 
threatened South Korea's leader.

A Defence Ministry spokesman said two of the wounded were in a serious condition, but added that all three were expected to survive (pictured, soldiers from Yim's outpost)

'Due
 to a shortage of troops, even some soldiers on the list of special 
attention had to be on border guard, which requires soldiers to be 
heavily armed.

Needless to say, the military needs to come up with 
remedial measures to this problem,' the Korea Times said in an 
editorial.

Hundreds of 
thousands of troops from the rival Koreas are squared off along the 
world's most heavily armed border.

The Korean Peninsula is still 
technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an 
armistice, not a peace treaty.

Shooting
 rampages against fellow soldiers happen occasionally. South Korea's 
military maintains a conscription system requiring all able-bodied men 
to serve about two years because of the North Korean threat.

In
 2011, a 19-year-old marine corporal went on a shooting rampage at a 
Gwanghwa Island base, just south of the maritime border with North 
Korea.

Military investigators later said that corporal was angry about 
being shunned and slighted and showed signs of mental illness before the
 shooting.

In 2005, a 
soldier threw a hand grenade and opened fire at a front-line army unit 
in a rampage that killed eight colleagues and injured several others.

Pfc Kim Dong-min told investigators he was enraged at superiors who 
verbally abused him.
