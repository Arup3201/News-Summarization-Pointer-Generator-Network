Basketball superstar LeBron James landed in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the World Cup final on Sunday, and he said the Maracana showdown is bigger than the NBA Finals.

Fresh from announcing his decision to leave the Miami Heat and return to his first team the Cleveland Cavaliers, James touched down in Brazil to watch Germany face Argentina.

According to ESPN.com, the two-time NBA champion signed a two-year contract with the Cavaliers worth $42.1m (£24.6m).

Appearance: James spoke in public for the first time since announcing his decision to return to Cleveland

Speaking at a promotional event in Rio, James said; 'This is bigger than the NBA finals in the sense of the world. You have all the players representing their countries. It's the ultimate sport. You have to play as a team. 

'The NBA finals is the ultimate for basketball. This is the ultimate for football. I've been watching it from home in the States and it's been an unbelievable tournament.'

But James declined to pick a winner between Germany and Argentina after meeting hundreds of fans and watching young Brazilians show off their basketball skills at a warehouse near Guanabara Bay.

Praise: James singled out Argentina's Lionel Messi as the best player in the world

He said: 'The Germans have a better team overall but Argentina have one of the best, if not the best, player in the world in Messi. We'll see. That is why you play the game.'

James announced to Sports Illustrated on Friday that he was returning home to the Cavaliers after four years in Miami.

Under the terms of his new contract, James can opt out as a free agent if he wants to next summer. By only signing for two years, James can negotiate another contract with the Cavaliers before the 2016-17 season, when a new television deal is expected to push the maximum salary higher than it currently stands at $20.7m (£12.09m).

'We could not be happier to welcome LeBron James home,' Cavaliers general manager David Griffin said. 'LeBron, through his essay, told us he wasn't going anywhere except Cleveland and that "Cleveland is where he always believed he would finish his career."

No comment: James did not confirm whether he would be back in Rio in 2016 to defend USA's Olympic title

'These words and commitment put all of us, including LeBron, in the best position to build our franchise the right way and achieve the kind of goals we all know are possible. Expectations will be at the highest levels but no one should expect immediate and automatic success.'

James said: 'It's a really exciting time for myself. I am ready for the challenge.'

But one thing James didn't comment on was returning to Rio in 2016 to represent USA in the Olympic basketball tournament. James led the United States team to gold at both the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympics, but didn't confirm whether he would play at Rio 2016.
