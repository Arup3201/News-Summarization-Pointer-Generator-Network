Nearly half of Harvard University's incoming freshmen have admitted they've cheated on homework, according to the Ivy League institution's newspaper. 

A year after the elite school was embroiled in a major cheating scandal, 42 per cent of 1,300 Class of 2017 students stated  in an anonymous The Harvard Crimson survey that they'd been academically dishonest.

One in 10 respondents admitted to having cheated on an exam, while 17 percent said they had cheated on a paper or take-home assignment.

The exclusive institution is still reeling from a 2012 cheating scandal in which dozens of students swapped and plagiarized answers during a course.

About 70 undergrads were forced to withdraw from the school when the scandal blew up, while others claimed they simply 'collaborated' on the exam and wanted to sue the university.

In a further blow to the university, the latest survey also found that 20 percent of freshman athletes admitted to cheating on an exam, compared with nine percent of other students.

Men were more likely than women to report having cheated.

More than 1,600 freshman were emailed the 10-minute, 60-question survey last month, with about 80 per cent responding.

The data is part of a series of reports delveing into the demographics of Harvard’s incoming freshmen, covering sexual preference, post-graduate expectations and family income.

Harvard's senior communications officer,  Jeff Neal, told NBC News the university has established a committee comprising faculty, staff and students to address the issue of cheating, which he said was 'a national problem in American education'.

'While the vast majority of Harvard and other students do their work honestly, beginning this year Harvard College has implemented a new, more robust strategy of communicating with all students, particularly first-year students, about the importance – and the ways to achieve – academic integrity,' he said.
