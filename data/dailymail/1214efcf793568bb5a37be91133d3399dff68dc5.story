A teen mom from Texas, whose boyfriend is accused of killing her 19-month-old daughter, has been arrested over claims that she helped hide the body.

Alexis Botello, 17, allegedly told police how she and Joshua Markus Beard bought shovels and gloves at a Walmart before burying her daughter, Tylea Moore, under a bridge.

Beard, 20, is facing a murder charge over claims that he stomped on Tylea and beat her death at the couple's Arlington home on Friday or Saturday.

Botello, who had recently graduated from high school, is facing charges of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, and injury to a child.

The teenager had originally told police she hadn't seen her daughter for two days, but later told them Beard had killed the toddler.

She said he 'didn't mean to do it' according to police records seen by Dallas News.

The couple had been dating for only a few months. Tylea's father, Chris Moore, is a Marine who used to attend the same school as Botello.

Botello allegedly told police that after her daughter died, she and Beard put the little girl's body in the car and drove to a store.

After buying gloves and shovels they buried Tylea under a bridge. Human remains were found in the area on Monday, but police have not confirmed if they belong to the victim.

Botello said on the night her toddler died, she and Beard had been fighting because he had allegedly been yelling at her daughter.

She said when she checked on her daughter Saturday morning, Tylea was covered in bruises and bite marks and 'looked awful'. 

Botello 
claimed Beard had repeatedly struck the child, and threw her on the bed 
with such force that she bounced on to the ground.

He then allegedly stomped repeatedly on her stomach until she vomited 'green stuff' police documents state.

The teenager said they both tried to resuscitate Tylea but it didn't work.

Botello’s bail has been set at $125,000 and her boyfriend, who is facing a capital murder charge, had his set at $1 million.
