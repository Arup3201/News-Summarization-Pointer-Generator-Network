Christmas is normally a time when parents can spoil their children with presents and treats.

But one mother has to keep her baby at home over the festive period – because he is allergic to Christmas.

Ryan Costello, nearly two, is severely allergic to dairy, including milk and chocolate, eggs and alcohol.

His allergy is so severe that if he even brushes against someone who has eaten a chocolate from an advent calendar or swallowed a glug of eggnog in the past 24 hours he vomits, suffers diarrhoea and breaks out in a red, angry rash.

Ryan Costello, nearly two, has to stay at home this Christmas because he is severely allergic to dairy, eggs and alcohol and gets ill if he brushes against anyone who has eaten these foods

As a baby, doctors though Ryan was a virus. But allergy and blood tests confirmed severe allergies were causing his angry, red rash (pictured left and right). He was even allergic to his mother's breast milk

Ryan's mother Lisa Costello, 26, who is supported by the charity Allergy UK, says Ryan's allergies affect him so much it is 'heartbreaking'. She is pictured here with her son

While he suffers all year round, problem is particularly bad at Christmas. This is because there are more 'danger foods' around at this time.

Last week Ryan went to a Reindeer Parade in his hometown of Middlesbrough. But his hand knocked another child's – and he immediately developed a huge rash.

His mother, Lisa Costello, 26, and HGV driver father, Jon Costello, 30, have now asked people not to visit them if they have eaten any of the foods he is allergic to in the past 24-hours.

They will be having a special Christmas dinner, with vegetables but without any of the things which causes a reaction.

'It's dreadful,' Mrs Costello said.

'I dread Christmas-time because there is so much he can't eat. He is allergic to Christmas.

'Ryan is also allergic to Christmas pudding, chocolates, Christmas cake, Yorkshire puddings chocolate, cake, biscuit, crisps, yoghurt, pasta, ice-cream, ice pops, bananas, dust, wool, detergents, grass pollen, soaps and even heat.'

He gets weighed regularly at the doctor's surgery, and all the staff now have to make sure they don't eat eggs in the 24 hours before he visits.

At first, doctors believed he was suffering from a virus.

'But they did an allergy and blood tests at 11 months old and worked out this wasn't the case.  

The family, who are supported by charity Allergy UK, bought Ryan dairy-free chocolate, but it is virtually impossible to take him out because he was affected so easily and allergic to so much.

Mrs Costello, a full-time mother, added: 'I can't even drink wine.

Ryan's family bought him dairy-free chocolate for Christmas, and they will eat a 'safe' Christmas meal, made mainly of vegetables. Ryan is pictured here with HGV driver father Jon Costello, 30

Mrs Costello says she is dreading her son starting school, as he will be around children who have eaten eggs. He is pictured (left and right) suffering a rash

'I had a hen do and drank some and came back – he started swelling up. I realised what it was.

'As a baby he was also allergic to my breast milk.'

She tries not to keep Ryan inside, and loves taking him out, but it's difficult as he can't be near people, or touched by people who have eaten eggs.

Mrs Costello said: 'It's exhausting for him.

'We want him to have a normal life but it affects him so much.'

His mother has already spoken to the primary school he will attend about his problems, but so far there seems like no obvious solution.

'I am dreading him starting school,' she admitted.

She said the rule they had adopted was 'to assume everybody had eaten eggs' and are currently in discussion how he will be able to attend.

Despite not being able to eat and do many things, Mrs Costello said Ryan is growing well and is always in good spirits.

She said: 'In other ways he is a great height and weight, but as soon as he touches many foods he is poorly. It's heartbreaking.

'He always has a smile on his face though.'
