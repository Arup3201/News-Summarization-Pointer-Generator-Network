A New Hampshire cop was so incensed when he realized a 'distraught' woman had lied about speeding to reach her dying father that he made a point of going to her house and arresting her.

Carley Williams, 28, was pulled over by Trooper Christopher Cummings after she was caught speeding down the Everett Turnpike at 82 mph in a 65 mph zone at 9 p.m on August 2nd.

Letting her off a ticket on Friday because she told him that her father was down to his dying breaths, Cummings was stunned to discover that not only had she manipulated him, but that her father had died five years ago.

'I'm pretty used to people trying to bend the truth to get out of speeding citations, but this woman preyed on my emotions as a human being,' Christopher J. Cummings, the state trooper who made the arrest, told ABC News today.

'She told me her father had stage four cancer, that he was breathing only six breaths a minute, and that she was trying to make it to the hospital before he passed,' said Cummings.

Williams told Cummings that her father was at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester and she wanted to see him before he passed away.

'I was parked along the turnpike with my radar unit when I saw the vehicle traveling 82 mph in a 65 mph zone,' said Cummings.

'I took her driver's license and asked a question that I ask everyone I pull over. I asked if there was an emergency.'

Totally accepting of her 'emotional' story, Cummings returned her license and told her to move on, albeit slower.

'There was a good act that went along with it,' said Cummings.

'She seemed pretty emotional. It made me believe that this person was legitimately telling me the truth.'

However, just before he sent Williams on her way, he asked for her father's name.

'I called the hospital where Williams told me her father was a patient and asked if he was there. They told me he wasn't,' said Cummings to ABC News.

Taken aback by this, Cummings looked up Williams and her father and discovered that her father had died in 2008.

'I was upset,' said Cummings, 'For someone to lie about their deceased father just to get out of a speeding ticket was pretty upsetting to me as a person.'

Upon further investigation, Cummings realized that Williams was driving with a suspended registration so he headed over to her house because that in itself was a misdemeanor.

'This wasn't personal, it was a matter of law. The violation happened in my presence, so I made the arrest,' he said to ABC News.

Traveling to Williams' home on Sunday he brought a copy of her father's obituary and confronted the 28-year-old.

'She came out of her house, looking bewildered, and I told her I wanted her to explain something,' Cummings said.

'She looked at the obituary I had and immediately said it wasn't for her father but that it was for her uncle.'

However, once he arrested her for the suspended registration, Williams confessed everything.

She was charged with speeding and driving with a suspended registration and is due in Merrimack Circuit Court September 5th.

'While the N.H. State Police is sympathetic to personal emergencies,our 
primary objective is to protect life and property through the traditions
 of fairness, professionalism and integrity,‚Äù police said in a written 
statement.

'Within reason, individuals will be allowed to continue 
during emergency situations when we can ensure the safety of the 
individuals involved and the general public. Circumstances such as this 
one, however, will result in the appropriate action taking place.'
