A worried mother captured the moment one of the huge cannibal spiders invading Britain gobbled up an insect in her home.

Michelle Midwinter was shocked to discover a tube spider had taken up residence in her house in North Bradley, Wiltshire.

In a bid to catch the arachnid, she attempted to draw it out of its hole using a daddy long legs as bait.

A mother in Wiltshire discovered this huge tube spider lurking in her garage and tried to catch it using an insect

But - as her video shows - the creature leapt back into its hole moments after grabbing the stricken insect.

Tube spiders - one of the largest types of spider in the UK - are known for their green fangs and are said to eat their own mothers.

As summer gives way to autumn and winter, sightings of the creatures inside people's homes have increased over the last month.

Telling of her encounter with the spider, mother-of-one Ms Midwinter said: 'I thought the spider might pounce on anything moving - it looked pretty menacing.

'So to lure it out, I thought I'd feed it a crane fly near its nest to see what would happen. As you can see, the spider popped straight out, dragging the prey back into its nest.

'I must admit it was actually much bigger than I thought it would be - previous to this you could only really see its front legs and head as it sat at the entrance to its nest.

'After talking to my friend - who's a spider expert - I found out it is more than likely that there are more of them about.

'They tend to stay in their nest and you can only see them sitting at the entrance at night so I doubt a lot of people would even notice them if they were outside.'

She says she was shocked by the size of the creature, which she could only initially see lurking in its hole

Ms Midwinter discovered the creature after an identical spider, which she believes is another on lurking in her home, landed on her shoulder as she walked into her garage with her two-year-old daughter.

After eventually capturing it, she said: 'I considered trying to get the spider back in its nest, I thought I had better put it out at the end of the garden.

'I admit that after I released it I ran away in case it chased me because it looked pretty angry when it was trapped in the wine glass.'

It is the latest sighting of one of the spiders in Britain, which are believed to have moved to Britain from southern Europe due to the warmer weather.

Segestria florentina is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm.

Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year.

They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours.

They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it.

Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique.
