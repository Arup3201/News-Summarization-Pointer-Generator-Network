You might be happy popping a homemade ice cube into your drink to cool down, but celebrities and the super wealthy are now demanding premium blocks to go with their elaborate cocktails.

‘Luxury’ ice cubes have been designed to accompany premium drinks - and a bag of 50 will set you back a staggering $325.50 (£194).

While the price tag may be high, the company that makes them in Davis, California, claims they last longer and are healthier than the ordinary cubes found in a freezer.

Gläce Luxury Ice Co’s cubes provide ‘minimum dilution and maximum cooling’ and claim to be completely tasteless to allow consumers to ‘maximise the beverage experience’ at parties such as LA Fashion Week and at the Playboy Mansion.

But all these attributes come at a cost - with a bag of 50 ice cubes priced at $325 (£194).

While most people are happy filling up a plastic tray with tap water and stashing it in their freezer for a sunny day, the company said that such common methods could be detrimental to their health.

‘Traditional machine-ice, generally made with local tap water, may contain upwards of 150 impurities and carcinogens, resulting in poor tasting and potentially unhealthy ice,’ the firm claimed.

In contrast, Gläce Ice – which comes in both cubes and perfect spheres – is completely clear and contains no impurities.

The ‘Mariko’ spheres are the ‘most mathematically efficient way to cool your drink,’ the company continued.

Its ethos is that quality drinks deserve quality cooling. ‘Purified of minerals, additives and other pollutants that may contaminate the taste of premium spirits and drinks, Gläce Ice pieces are meticulously crafted to deliver the finest complement to top shelf liquors,’ according to the company’s website.

Like fine wine, the firm recommends the ice cubes are left to breathe for a few minutes before any liquid is
 poured onto them, but they do not break apart like ‘less deserving ice’
 upon contact with a warmer liquid.

The cubes are ‘individually carved’ from a 300lb (136kg) block of purified ice, which might go some way to justify its price tag.

Their shape measures 2.5inches (6cm) across.

The spheres can last in a drink for 20 to 30 minutes, while the 'G-cubed' ice shapes endure for up to 40 minutes - although there is no comparison to similar sized and shaped ‘normal’ ice cubes available.

Giant blocks of pristine ice, from which the cubes are carved, are made by freezing water from the outside so the centre of the ice is stirred to allow gases to escape.

When it is almost frozen, it is drained and replaced with sprayed layers to make it perfectly clear, Priceonomics reported.

The company was founded by Roberto Sequeira, a business school lecturer at the University of Los Angeles who came up with the idea for his company when he was dreaming up the 'perfect' business that is niche, high margin and scalable.

It is calculated that a block of ice measuring 8,000 cubic inches (20,320 cubic cm) costs between $60 (£36) and $100 (£60) and is enough to make 500 of the luxury ice cubes.

As Gläce sells them for $325 (£194) for a bag of 50, one $100 (£60) ice block could make a staggering $3,250 (£1,937) for the firm – although this has not be verified.

And if the ice cubes do melt, they are contained in re-sealable bags with a one-way air valve to push out possibly dirty ambient air, so at least you will have a bag full of luxurious clean water.
