These amazing photographs give a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘painting the town red’.

Hindu men and women have welcomed the beginning of spring by hurling coloured powder at one another during the annual Holi festival in India.

Celebrations start with a bonfire where people gather, sing and dance – before participants unleash a free-for-all style powder assault on anyone and everyone in the designated colour zones.

Over in the village of Nandgaon, 71 miles from New Delhi, men have kicked off the festival of colour in style – chasing people through the streets armed with their arsenal of colours.

In a Holi tradition unique to Nandgaon and Barsana villages, men sing provocative songs to gain the attention of women, who then 'beat' them with bamboo sticks called 'lathis'

Some use the powder dry, throwing it around and leaving a trail of colour in their wake.

Others mix the powder with water to decorate their friends and family members, as well as people they have never met.

Anyone and everyone is fair game: rich or poor, man or woman, children and elders – with the controlled chaos occurring in the open streets, parks, outside temples and buildings.

When the colour bombing is over in Nandgoan, Hindu devotees covered head to toe in in powder pray as they arrive at the Nandagram Temple.

According to Hindu mythology, men from Barsana arrive at the temple where they are soaked in coloured water by men from Nandgaon, believed to be Lord Krishna's village, and then beaten by the women of the village with wooden sticks as they depart the town.

The festival, which started as a chance to meet others, play, laugh and repair relationships, is now one of the biggest in the world.

In recent years it has spread among non-Hindus in many parts of south-east Asia, as well as to parts of Europe, North America and Australia.Holi is held every year before spring on the last full moon day of the lunar month.
