Unable to see the stage and blocked in by other fans, five-year-old Isabelle Nixon was less than impressed with the Invictus Games closing ceremony - until, that is, Prince Harry came to the rescue.

After spotting the little girl, the prince, 30, hoisted her on to his shoulders and then stayed to dance with her as the Foo Fighters took to the stage.

Isabelle, whose father Adam, 31, from Hereford, captained Team GB's wheelchair basketball team to victory on Sunday, had previously met Prince Harry on several occasions and regards him, according to her mother, as one of her heroes.

Isabelle said: 'I was completely over the moon. I was chuffed to bits.'

Mr Nixon, a former Gunner in 26 Regiment Royal Artillery, lost his one of his legs following an IED explosion in Basra in Iraq in March 2004.

His left leg had to be amputated while his right was badly damaged, leaving him confined to a wheelchair.

Despite
 his injury, Mr Nixon, who has four children, daughter Abigail, 11, 
Jayden, eight, five-year-old Isabelle and three-year-old Lilyana, 
continued to play his basketball.

'Prince 
Harry had spoken to us at the ceremony, just to say how proud he was of 
us guys,' explained Mr Nixon. 'We were underdogs in the final but we 
beat the US at their own game.'

'He came up, shook my hand and said: "You are a legend" and I asked him for a photo with him and my family.

'Then later, after his speech, Foo Fighters were on the main stage. He came to listen to the music.'

But when Harry, who had earlier told Mr Nixon that he just wanted to 'chill out' and watch the show, spotted the tearful Isabelle, he swung into action.

'He recognised her from earlier in the day and saw she was getting upset because she couldn’t see the band,' adds Mr Nixon.

'He approached us and smiled at me and just literally picked her up and just started to dance so she could see the stage.

'There was no calculation to it. He just recognised her from earlier and lifted her up on his shoulders so she could see. It was a bit of a whirlwind. It was very surreal.'

'She was lost for words,' added her proud father. 'She just danced along to the Foo Fighters with him and hasn’t stopped smiling since.'

Harry, who is now planning next year's event as well as working on other projects such as the Rugby World Cup, certainly made an impression.

'Isabelle now says 
she's a princess and tells all her friends she danced with "Uncle 
Harry",' said her mother Taryn. 'He was the perfect gentleman and made everyone’s day, especially Isabelle’s.'

'Harry just seems like one of the lads,' concluded Mr Nixon. 'He is a real credit to himself. It is a lifelong memory [for Isabelle]. She will always remember it.'

In a statement, Kensington Palace said: 'Prince Harry was keen to enjoy the closing concert and celebrate the Games with the competitors.

'The little girl’s father was the captain of the wheelchair basketball team, who Prince Harry met on several occasions throughout the course of the Games.'

Proud: Isabelle's mother Taryn, 30, and father Adam, 31, say Isabelle will remember the moment forever
