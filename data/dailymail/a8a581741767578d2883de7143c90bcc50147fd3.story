Three quarters of sunbeds have failed safety tests in undercover checks by officials.

Salons are using beds three times as hot as the Australian outback – putting unsuspecting clients at risk of serious skin conditions such as cancer.

In the worst cases, sunbeds breached the legal limit by as much as three times, emitting UV rays too hot to ever occur on earth.

Many salons are using sunbeds three times as hot as the Australian Outback - putting users at risk of skin cancer - an investigation by Trading Standards has revealed  

Tanning salons, hairdressers and nail bars with sunbeds caused the most concern, while sunbeds in gyms were found to have much higher levels of compliance.

Now, even the tanning industry has joined calls for tougher action against rogue operators.

The latest shock figures come from North Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department - but there are fears the problem could be nationwide. 

The report revealed that 75 per cent of sunbeds failed to meet the legal limit for an acceptable level of UV radiation.

Undercover officers found sunbeds emitting radiation at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the legal limit - a level hotter than the sun in the Australian Outback.

The investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot.

It involved Trading Standards officers donning protective radiation suits to check UV levels.

Tests carried out earlier this year in West Yorkshire found 89 per cent of beds failed to meet the legal safety limit.

Lamps in sunbeds can use a level of UV no more powerful than the legal limit of 0.3 watts per square metre, which is the equivalent of the sun on a hot day in Spain.

However, investigations in Wakefield, Bradford, Kirklees, Leeds, and Calderdale revealed some sunbeds were belting out 0.9 watts per square metre, a level of solar energy too hot ever to be found on earth.

Some beds were pumping out 0.9 watts per square metre, three times the legal limit and a level of UV radiation too hot ever to be found on earth

Similarly, an inspection of all the sunbeds in North Tyneside carried out in March  found that eight out of 10 sunbed salons failed to comply with the rules.

The average level of radiation they found was 0.49 watts per square metre, with at least one bed emitting 1.18 watts.

Officials underlined that while 0.3 watts can be compared with a hot day on the beach in the Mediterranean, 0.9 watts is completely off the scale.

The Trading Standards investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot

Clare Forbes, of West Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department said: 'Such levels of UV radiation do not occur anywhere on the earth's surface. Not even 0.6 occurs anywhere on earth.'

A Trading Standards officer for North Yorkshire County council said the beds that failed the tests were all suspended from use until the bulbs were repaired or replaced.

Officers will now expand the survey to cover the whole county. 

They added: 'As we move into autumn officers warned people who may be tempted to use sunbeds to maintain their holiday tan, that they may be risking serious skin damage and worse.'

Gary Lipman, Chairman of The Sunbed Association, joined in calls for further regulation to keep the public safe.

He said: 'We welcome North Yorkshire County Council's efforts to ensure sunbed businesses are operating within the law.

'Our Code of Practice requires our members to operate to best practise but beyond our membership we are aware that not all tanning businesses operate to such high standards.

'We very much hope that now these tests have been taken, the Council uses its powers to ensure compliance, so that all sunbed businesses are operating on a level playing field.

'Only the local authority has the powers to ensure compliance and where this is properly enforced across the board, experience dictates that the vast majority of salons comply.

'We would encourage the Council to take swift action against any salon that resists compliance.

'We would always recommend that anyone looking to use a sunbed, seeks out a member of The Sunbed Association, where they are assured of receiving correct advice and information from properly trained staff about responsible tanning.'
