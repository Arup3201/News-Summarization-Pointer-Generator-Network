A benefits fraudster who fled the UK for the Costa del Sol ahead of his sentencing in 2008 has been jailed for three years.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith labelled the case as 'outrageous' when it emerged 70-year-old Norman Brennan had been at large in Spain for five years.

He vowed to bring the pensioner back to face justice. Brennan had earlier admitting fraudulently claiming nearly £120,000 of various benefits before he skipped bail.

Some of the benefits were claimed in the name of his brother, Leslie, who had lived in Germany for nearly three decades.

Brennan, formerly of Netherton, Merseyside, was given bail when sentencing was adjourned in July 2008 but gave authorities the slip and left the country.

Last month, Sky News tracked down Brennan to the Spanish village of Mijas Costas, and asked him if he thought he should be in the UK.

'No,' was Brennan's response.

Mr Duncan Smith told the news channel: 'I'm astonished. I'll certainly take this case away, and I know that I have myself fraud investigators who are out in Spain already.

'So, what we'll do is we'll check this case, and I can promise you that if they haven't done enough, they will now do their level best to get this man back.

'This sort of case is outrageous, and I'll deal with it.'

Weeks later Brennan was detained on a European Arrest Warrant and extradited to Britain.

Sentencing him today at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge David Aubrey QC told him: 'The law has finally caught up with you.'

Brennan made the false claims between March 2001 and February 2008.

His first bogus application was for Jobseeker's Allowance and council tax benefit when he failed to declare ownership of another property he inherited from his mother in December 2000.

Emboldened by dishonestly receiving those benefits, he failed to notify the authorities a year later that he was now in work as a self-employed joiner - a job which he continued to do up to his arrest.

The third strand of the fraud also 
began in 2002 when he claimed Jobseeker's Allowance in the name of his 
brother, Lesley, who in fact had been living in Germany for three 
decades.

He forged the 
signature of his unsuspecting brother on benefit forms and he even 
pretended to be him when he handed in identity documents to social 
security staff, including a bogus ID card which showed his photograph.

Brennan admitted seven counts of council tax, housing benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance fraud at the earlier hearing in 2008.

Today
he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for those counts and given an 
additional six months in prison for failing to surrender to bail when he
did not attend his original sentencing hearing.

Judge
Aubrey told him: 'The claims in my judgment were dishonest through and 
through. They were blatant. Week by week, month after month, year by 
year, you were in effect stealing from the public purse.

'You have shown complete and utter disdain and contempt - not only for the welfare state but also the criminal justice system.

'The
fraud was persistent, prolonged and sophisticated. You were fleecing 
the public purse with no compunction and in my judgment as a result of 
sheer greed.

Vernon Sanderson, Department for Work and Pensions regional fraud manager, said: 'We have worked hard with Sefton Council and the police to bring Brennan back to justice.

'Fraudsters need to know our investigators have the resources and powers to ensure we track them down wherever they hide and make sure they face the courts.'
