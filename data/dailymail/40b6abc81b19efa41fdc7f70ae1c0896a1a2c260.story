The Super Bowl scored its highest-ever overnight ratings for New England's thrilling win over Seattle, an early indication the game may be on the way to another viewership record.

The Nielsen company said Monday the game had a 49.7 rating in the nation's largest media markets, up four percent over last year's game. 

That means 49.7 percent of the homes in those 56 markets were watching the game.

The nation as a whole has 116 million homes with television.

Nielsen had no immediate estimate of the number of viewers. 

Last year's contest between Seattle and Denver was seen by 111.5 million, the annual game setting a record for the most-watched TV event in U.S. history for the fourth time in five years.

The game had a 72 share, meaning 72 percent of televisions on Sunday night were tuned to NBC's broadcast of the game in which the Patriots scored a 28-24 victory over the Seahawks.

Broadcasts of the game make up the top 21 most viewed programs in US history.

In 1967, when the first Super Bowl was held, around 50 million tuned into the game. This fell towards 40 million in its second year.

However the number of viewers has massively increased and sets constantly high ratings records.

In comparison the final episode of M*A*S*H attracted a 60 per cent share of viewers while an audience of 53 million tuned in for a 1996 episode of Friends.

The Super Bowl makes up the top 21 broadcasts of all time on US television.

The next closest is a series finale of M*A*S*H in 1983 which drew 60 per cent of households across the country.

Only 50 million watched the first game in 1967, but since then viewer numbers have skyrocketed.
