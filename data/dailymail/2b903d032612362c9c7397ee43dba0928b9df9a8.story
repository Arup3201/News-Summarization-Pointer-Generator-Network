Brazilian forward Neymar has reported back for Barcelona training just one month after his World Cup heartbreak.

The 22-year-old broke his vertebra in the host's quarter-final game against Colombia and was ruled out for the remainder of their disappointing tournament.

Neymar, who will be hoping to kick on this year under Luis Enrique after an up-and-down first season, posted a picture on Instagram with the caption:  'And the season began...... #pracimamajor'

Back to training: Neymar seemed in a cheerful mood as he reported back for Barcelona training on Tuesday

Crunch: Juan Zuniga broke Neymar's game during a World Cup game between Brazil and Colombia

Chilled: He has been making the most of his summer break, meeting up with German Bastian Schweinsteiger

The challenge from Juan Zuniga on July 4 could have ended Neymar's career had it been inches higher, and the youngster has been in a brace ever since.

He was not able to take part in full training with his well renowned team-mates on Tuesday, including another returning World Cup star Lionel Messi, but hopes to be fit for the start of the La Liga season.

Meanwhile Messi, who was handed the Golden Ball at the Maracana after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, was sporting a new haircut. 

New haircut: Lionel Messi will be hoping fortunes change on the pitch this season for Barcelona

Doubters: Neymar needs to add more consistency to his game under new boss Luis Enrique
