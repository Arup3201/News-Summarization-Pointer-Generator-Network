It is the fruit most associated with those lazy, hazy days of British summer. So perhaps it comes as no surprise the strawberry has been crowned the ‘happiest fruit’.

Its appeal is so strong that 86 per cent of people feel more relaxed just by thinking about eating one, a survey for the University of London revealed.

Researcher Professor Barry Smith said it is the distinctive smell of strawberries that evokes happy memories.

Fruits such as apples bring back less pleasant memories of meals on the go, while bananas and plums were the least likely to improve mood.

The study also found that sound impacts on taste, with the noise of a picnic or lawnmower making strawberries seem fruitier than a background of honking traffic or a bustling office.

Finally, despite our love of strawberries and cream, those who took part in the study for the growers at British Summer Fruits said they were more likely to associate the berries with the smell of freshly cut grass.

With this in mind, chef James ‘Jocky’ Petrie, of the Ledbury restaurant in London’s Notting Hill, has created a strawberry sandwich complete with a ‘grass’ layer – made from white chocolate and wheatgrass.

Professor Smith, who did the research at the University of London’s Centre for the Study of the Senses, said: ‘The smell is difficult to create artificially.

'Flavouring companies have failed at it by and large and yet it is so powerful as a reminder of those happy summer days.’
