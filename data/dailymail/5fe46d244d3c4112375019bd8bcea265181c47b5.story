Payback: Tory MP Nadine Dorries is to return £3,000 in expenses after an investigation by a Commons watchdog

Outspoken Tory MP Nadine Dorries has repaid £3,000 in travel expenses after accepting that the claims were ‘wrongfully made and should not have been allowed’.

She admitted the money was to make between Westminster and her Mid Bedfordshire constituency for family reasons and a sick pet dog, and not in connection with her job as an MP.

Today she renewed her call for MPs’ expenses ‘to be scrapped in their entirety’.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) launched an investigation in Miss Dorries’s expenses earlier this year after noticing an ‘unusual’ pattern of claims.

While it found the travel claims were outside the rules, complaints about expense claims for utility bills were dismissed after compliance officer Peter Davis ruled it would be ‘disproportionate’ to penalise the MP further after making ‘no finding’ about how much time she spent at her London accommodation.

A preliminary report by the expenses watchdog was posted on the Ipsa website today.

An Ipsa spokesman said: ‘‘As part of the regular review of all MPs' claims, Ipsa's internal assurance function found that Nadine Dorries MP's pattern of travel and accommodation claims were unusual, and were referred to the compliance officer for investigation.

‘The compliance officer for Ipsa has concluded his investigation into claims made by Ms Dorries for accommodation and travel and subsistence under the third and fourth editions of the scheme.

‘The compliance officer has found that claims made by Ms Dorries were outside the scheme, and that these claims should be repaid. Ms Dorries has subsequently repaid these claims.’

The three allegations included:

The report said Ms Dorries did not contest the details of her travel claims but said she outlined several explanations for the other allegations, including family commitments and family illness, and an elderly pet dog.

Outlining Ms Dorries' evidence, the report said: ‘Whilst undertaking her parliamentary duties, the MP and a dependent family member used the premises during the period when utility bills increased.

‘Ms Dorries is a single parent with an elderly pet dog and a dependent family. During the period subject of the complaint, the MP returned to her constituency home to attend to family commitments, including times when a family member and the pet dog suffered illness.

‘At the time of taking out a 12-month 
lease on her current Ipsa-funded property, Ms Dorries was not able to 
predict her level of occupancy and viewed its use as the most effective 
way of facilitating her parliamentary function.’

It
added: ‘Ms Dorries believes that she has acted within the principles of
the scheme and that there has been no deliberate wrongdoing.’

The outspoken backbencher has already announced she will no longer claim expenses

In a statement posted on her website, Ms Dorries questioned why Ipsa had chosen to carry out an ‘expensive and time-consuming investigation into my expenses’.

And the MP, who was suspended from the Conservative Parliamentary Party after she appeared on TV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, added: ‘I am sure it is just a coincidence that, as the pressure began to mount for my whip to be returned after three months of suspension, wham, I surprisingly had an investigation in process.

‘Any request for reinstatement met with the response from the Chief Whip (Sir George Young): 'We now have to wait for the Ipsa investigation to end'.’

Ms Dorries said she was ‘delighted’ that Ipsa had made no findings against her, noting that she could have legitimately made more claims than she had.

Her statement said any overpayments were due to a ‘technical breach which was Ipsa's fault’.

‘They were wrongfully claimed on Ipsa's explicit instructions to claim and then wrongfully paid by Ipsa,’ she said.

Ms Dorries claimed that Ipsa had failed to pay her £6,000 of salary and failed to mention this in the provisional report, blaming ‘total incompetence’ at the organisation.

She said she believed Ipsa needed fundamental reform leading to the abolition of MPs' expenses.

‘Anyway, as everyone knows, I have removed myself from the personal expenses system. I shall use my salary to fund my second home in Westminster and my travel and all other personal expenses, which in effect means I shall be working for free,’ she said.

‘When we had the expenses crisis in 2009, the problem was never who paid the expenses, it was expenses. Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg thought that the answer to the problem, was to change the people who paid the expenses from the fees office to IPSA.

‘Expenses need to be scrapped in their entirety.’

Ms Dorries' occupancy of her second home, funded by Ipsa, was considered to be ‘significantly less’ than other MPs, raising questions as to whether she should be considered ‘routinely resident’ as required by the rules.
