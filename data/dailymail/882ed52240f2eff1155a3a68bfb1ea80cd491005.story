Changed into black shorts and sheer top to perform Run This Town with Jay-Z and Coldplay

Performed the only non-Coldplay live performance of the night with her solo hit We Found Love

She's known for her raunchy wardrobe and showing off rather a lot of skin on stage.

But last night (Sunday), Rihanna covered up as she performed to the world at the Paralympics Closing Ceremony.

The Barbadian singer was announced as a 'special guest of Coldplay' as she entered the stadium on a punk pirate ship.

The singer had flown in specially to London to duet with frontman Chris Martin on their No.4 hit Princess Of China.

The 24-year-old wore a pair of drawstring orange trousers, sheer blouse and coat as she 'sailed' into the Olympic Stadium on the boat.

At the beginning of the song, her vocals were drowned out by Chris and the music, before she gained strength later in the track.

The entrance of Rihanna after eight Coldplay songs was no doubt a welcome relief for people who weren't fans of the rock band.

During
 the singer's duet with the band, Twitter was awash with comments of how
 covered up she was in her full-length outfit and questioning why a 
non-Brit was playing at the ceremony.

The
 previous opening and closing ceremonies for the Olympics and opening 
ceremony for the Paralympics all included British singers and bands.

One Twitter user wrote: 'Rihanna has put some clothes on. This must be an important gig! #closingceremony.'

And another one tweeted: 'Rihanna isn't even British shouldn't even be there.'

Following her duet, Rihanna took a step back as Coldplay performed their song Strawberry Swing with the Para Orchestra, led by Charles Hazelwood.

She then returned to arena, seated on a metal bench suspended in the air as she sang her own hit We Found Love.

Before she went on, she said: ‘Being 
at the Paralympics is the biggest honour. These athletes are gladiators 
and are a true inspiration to me.’

Coldplay and Rihanna were paid the token sum of £1 for their appearances.

Just hours before going on stage, she
 Tweeted cryptically: ‘B****** ain’t gettin money, but they got an 
opinion’, and, using the n-word, wrote, ‘Yea I’m talkin Rih, n**** 
I’m talkin me’.

Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, 35, 
who is married to Hollywood actress Gwenyth Paltrow, said: ‘Being asked 
to play at the closing celebrations for the Paralympic athletes in 
London is such a great honour for us.

‘It was one of the biggest nights of 
our lives and we were excited to try to create a performance for the 
last night of the games that closed London 2012 in style.’
