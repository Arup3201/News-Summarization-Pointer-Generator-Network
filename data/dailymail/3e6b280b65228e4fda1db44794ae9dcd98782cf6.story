Wayne Rooney will win his 100th England cap on Saturday when he leads the side out against Sloveia at Wembley.

Here, we look back at Matt Lawton's match report from the night he made his bow for his country.

Full marks for the Socceroos, plus marks for the Socceroonies and a large black mark for Sven Goran Eriksson and the players who purport to be the current England side.

If the appearance of Wayne Rooney and his young chums offered a glimmer hope for the future, the slow, agonising surrender of those who went before them caused only anxiety at Upton Park last night.

So disappointing were Eriksson's troubled side in the first half of this ludicrous friendly that his confirmation that all 11 members of the 'A' team would be replaced by Wayne and the Wannabes resembled something akin to a tactical masterstroke.

England's first XI were awful, losing to a far more industrious and infinitely more inventive Australia in a fashion alarmingly reminiscent of that shambles against Macedonia in Southampton last October. For Eriksson it was a catastrophe, and not just because a first defeat to our friends from Down Under now sits on his c.v. as England coach.

Appeasing the clubs by limiting his players to no more than 45 minutes was always going to be a risky business. Last night, it was made to look utterly foolish.

This was England's one and only chance to prepare for next month's European Championship doubleheader against Liechtenstein and Turkey. In the end, they did not even have the opportunity to restore some much-needed confidence after the break.

Eriksson made a total of 11 changes at half-time, including the then-Everton star Rooney

Eriksson might have apologised on the eve of this encounter for the fact that England caps are cheap these days but there can be no excuse for giving away defeats in as reckless a manner as this.

Australia, who had not played together for 15 months, took little more than 15 minutes to inflict the first blow, Tony Popovic opening the scoring with a far-post header, before Harry Kewell added to England's humiliation three minutes before the halftime whistle. What a pity the Leeds United forward enjoys so little exposure in the international arena.

How Rooney must have felt was anybody's guess. Not only was he denied the chance to join the big boys for what should have been a joyous occasion for England's youngest international, but he and his inexperienced colleagues were being asked to rescue a most embarrassing situation for the seniors.

They did better than many perhaps imagined, taking the lead in the latter of what were two games of one half with a fine goal from Francis Jeffers before losing the chance to gloat when Brett Emerton added Australia's third in the 83rd minute. Even so, they still did a good deal better than David Beckham and Co.

Rooney showed that, even at 17 and 111 days, he is certainly man enough for the job. His talent is raw, his ability still a touch unrefined, but he made an immediate impression that gave the 'B' team real impetus. Controlling the ball on his chest quite beautifully, he then exchanged passes with the impressive Jermaine Jenas and unleashed a long-range pass that fell at the feet of Darius Vassell. At that stage it was England's best move of the match and almost ended in a goal but for Vassell's failure to hit the target.

Jeffers, another product of the Everton youth team until moving to Arsenal, took his goal wondercumbing-fully, meeting a 70th-minute cross from Jenas with a perfect header. Another bright spot was Owen Hargreaves demonstrating the same World Cup form that should see him restored to the first team for next month's matches.

The kids did well, particularly when one considers they were faced with an Australia team that made just one change at halftime and were already two up. Sucto Emerton's goal when the Feyenoord striker ran on to a John Aloisi pass before diverting the ball through the legs of Paul Robinson was no disgrace.

Had an understandably disillusioned crowd known just how depressing the first half would be, they would have urged the FA to kick off as planned at eight o'clock.

As it was, travel chaos and a halfempty stadium persuaded the organisers to put the start back by 15 minutes, which succeeded only in delaying the embarrassment.

Before the start, David James must have relished the chance to appear at Upton Park without the burden of standing behind the worst defence in the Premiership. By the time Australia had scored, though, he must have felt he was back playing for West Ham.

Those with the most to prove all tried to make an early impression. Kieron Dyer looked busy down the left, Frank Lampard passed smoothly from the centre and a cross that was intended for Michael Owen turned into an attempt on goal for James Beattie.

That, however, was about as good as it got for England's 'A' team and it was not long before Frank Farina's spirited side had taken control.

Popovic has already made Michael Owen's life a misery twice this season as a centre half for Crystal Palace and he added England to his illustrious list of scalps when he escaped the attentions of Gary Neville to head the ball home at the far post.

A terrific save from James then denied Mark Viduka a second for Australia but there was little he could do when Rio Ferdinand allowed Kewell to muscle him off the ball, drag the ball wide of the England goalkeeper and shoot into an empty net.

With the second half came an improvement from England's lions cubs, a performance of some promise for which they did not deserve the boos they received at the final whistle. After the Ashes and the Davis Cup, such displeasure should have been reserved for those responsible.
