DNA results have finally revealed the genetic make-up of the impossibly cute yet oddly shaped half-dog Pig.

Turns out Pig the Dog is mainly a Boxer, Chow Chow and American Staffordshire Terrier, AL.com reported. But it also has some Portuguese Water Dog, Alaskan Klee Kai, Scottish Deerhound, Lakeland Terrier and Maltese.

'I felt like a cartoon character with my head crooked sideways going, "huh?"' Pig's human, Kim Dillenbeck, told AL.com. 'I don't see any of those close to her by appearance.'

'Everybody thought Akita,' added Dillenbeck, who lives in Helena, Alabama. 'I was was thinking something like a smaller dog, but I was wide open.

Pig has shot to fame since her cute looks and odd shape hit the Internet

Pig's human, Kim Dillenbeck, says the pooch is still growing

'I've never seen her  mother's personality,' Dillenbeck told AL.com. 'Pig has all these interesting traits, and there are so many breeds out there.

'With that tail and all that hopping, maybe rabbit?'

'Pig is her own breed,' Dillenbeck added. 'To me, she is just one in a million. As much as I can see her potential in all these breeds, she is still just Pig.'

Dillenbeck  adopted Pig, who was born with significant physical issues, during a trip to Atlanta to see her sister.

'I met some of her neighbors who came over for Christmas breakfast, and after hearing about Pig, we all went to her house,' Dillenbeck said.

'Pretty quickly, I decided to be her mother because she probably wouldn't live,' Dillenbeck told Al.com. 'We assumed that by now, she would be suffocating under her own organs, or something like that, because of her shape.'

Pig, who was born in the wild, was taken in along with her sisters by a woman who heard her barking, Al.com reported.

Dillenbeck told Al.com Pig has multiple health issues, including missing ribs, incorrectly rotated joints, and damaged vertebrae.

Despite her size as a 'half-dog,' Pig, who is 8 months old months old, could still get bigger.

'She's not fully grown,' Dillenbeck told Al.com. 'She's still gaining weight. At this point, she has the potential to gain another 20 pounds, and that would probably kill her.'

Though Dillenbeck said she is not sure about Pig's future, she's happy to have her in her life.

'I'm the lucky one. She makes me laugh every day,' she said.
