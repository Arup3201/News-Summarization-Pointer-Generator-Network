At first glance, it looks like an iPhone, but with ugly buttons on the front screen.

However, in fact this is Lenovo's latest Android handset.

Available in China, it appears to have taken inspiration from Apple's latest handset design, with identical curved edges, antenna strips and even placement of buttons and connectors.

Spot the difference: Apple's iPhone 6, left, and the new Lenovo 

Lenovo's Sisley S90 will only be released in China, and it will come with a price tag of Yuan 1,999 or around US$330. 

It boasts a 5-inch Super-AMOLED HD display, a 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 410 SoC, an Adreno 306 GPU with 1 GB RAM and 16 GB ROM.

It is also dual-SIM enabled and features a 13-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front secondary camera.

However, Lenovo says it is impossible it copied the design, saying, 'Considering the product design lifecycle of any smartphone – at least a year in planning and prototyping – it's not possible to copy a design so quickly.'

It comes just weeks after Apple's British-born design boss Sir Jonathan Ive told the audience at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco his feelings on the matter of copying were 'a bit harsh'.

'I don't see it as flattery,' he said, 'I actually see it as theft.'

Sir Jonathan  said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals.

'When you're doing something for the first time, for example with the phone, and you don't know it's going to work, and you spend seven or eight years working on something, and then it's copied — I have to be honest, the first thing I think isn't 'ooh, that was flattering.

Spot the difference: Even the rear of the handset looks identical, with the stripe and rounded edge

'All those weekends I could have had at home with my lovely family but didn't, but the flattery made up for it.'

The designer was also asked about Xiaomi, a Chinese firm which has been accused of copying Apple's style.

Not an iPhone: the Xiaomi Miui 6 handset, which many have said is simply a copy of the iPhone

The firm's latest software and handset looks extremely similar to Apple's iOS 8 software. 

The designer also gave a rare insight into how his team works, revealing there are just 16 or 17 people.

'It's grown steadily over the last 15 years,' he said.
