He's known for living life in the fast lane.

So as he returned to Munich for Oktoberfest on Friday evening there were no signs of Usain Bolt slowing down as he became the heart and soul of the party.

Swapping his Lycra for a Lederhosen, the 28-year-old was seen in high spirits as he tried out the beer on offer while in the company of a buxom blonde.

Looking forward to visiting Schützen-Festzelt, Usain took to his Instagram account to post a snap of his full attire for the event.

The caption that accompanied the image read: 'Oktoberfest here we come @johnsteffensen @rickysimms #NJ #Lederhosen #Munich'.

In the photo Bolt can be seen sporting the traditional German attire with a green checkered shirt and olive high-top Puma trainers.

It is the second time the double Olympic 100m, 200m and 4x100m champion has attended the famous event this year after he a tweeted a picture basking in the culture of the world famous event last month.

Returning to Germany will always bring back happy memories to the Jamaican who shattered both the 100m and 200m world records during the 2009 World Championships held in Berlin with times of 9.58 and 19.19 seconds.

Bolt added to his international medal haul in August when he was part of Jamaica's successful gold medal 4x100m relay team at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
