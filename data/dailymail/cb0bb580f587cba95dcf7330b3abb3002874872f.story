Main man: Arsenal's star signing of the summer Alexis Sanchez has the talent to light up the Premier League

 

INTELLIGENCE

When Alexis Sanchez played for Barcelona, he’d start out wide but make clever runs inside at the last minute to latch on to balls from Xavi and Iniesta. He swooped inside like a Red Arrows plane. He has real footballing intelligence and is even more effective when he starts down the middle.

SPEED 

Sanchez has electric pace but most impressive is how many high-intensity sprints he can manage over 90 minutes. He repeats them again and again. I watched him training this week and he already looks up to speed, amazing considering he returned later than most of the rest of the squad because of the World Cup. In the match against Brazil at the World Cup, he made 68 sprints, well above average of the rest of his team. He regularly hits 18mph and FIFA ranked him the world’s 10th fastest player.

WORK-RATE 

This is what makes him stand out. He dictates the pace the team plays at because he works so hard out of possession. I’ve rarely seen that level of tenacity and intensity. He gets through so much work, closing down the opposition defenders. That attitude turned an ordinary team in Chile into an excellent one at the World Cup. He is not like so many forwards, who only come alive when they have the ball. He will set a new benchmark of what’s required from a Premier League striker.

STRENGTH 

He’s only 5ft 7in but Sanchez is brave and strong. At the Emirates Cup you saw him going up for challenges others would have ducked. He’s fearless.

FINISHING 

Only Lionel Messi scored more for Barca than Sanchez’s 21 last season. Alexis scored or assisted in 63 goals during his 88 La Liga appearances. He will score more as he grows in confidence. He was forever playing second fiddle to Messi. As the main man at Arsenal, he can really thrive.
