Wyoming and Montana will get an early taste of fall this year as an unseasonably cool low pressure system puts a chill in the air around the northern Rockies.

That will put temperatures at 35 degrees below average in some places over the weekend while Glacier National Park may not even get to a 50 degree high.

The chill will be a sharp contrast to the rest of the country which should have a weekend of heat and humidity.

Wunderground reports that the region's highest elevations might see temperatures dip below freezing as well as the season's first snowfall.

The cold comes three weeks ahead of the forecast which predicted the first temperature below 32 degrees for Sept. 13 in West Glacier, Montana.

While as much as 8 inches of snow could fall on the highest peaks, it should melt quickly.

In 1992, a foot of snow fell in the Glacier National Park's northeast section in August.

Great Falls, Montana, also reported August snowfall in 1992 with 8.3 inches. The coldest temperature for the month there remains 38 degrees.

It's likely the cold mornings will go on until Wednesday and residents shouldn't be surprised to wake up to a layer of frost on the ground.
