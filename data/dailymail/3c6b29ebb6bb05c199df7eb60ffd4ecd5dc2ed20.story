Four people including a three-year-old boy remained critically ill this afternoon after a devastating blaze tore through a family home.

Eight people, all but one from the same family, were rescued from the terraced, two-storey property in Honiton, Devon.

A 17-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man were in a serious condition at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital while a man in his 30s was also seriously ill from inhaling smoke.

The toddler also suffered serious injuries and was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. Another boy aged six was discharged from hospital.

A three-year-old boy, two teenagers and a man in his 30s were seriously injured in hospital following a fire at this family home

Police have said officers were called to a house fire at a property in Honiton, East Devon, shortly before 8am, along with firefighters and the air ambulance.

Neighbour Dave Joslin, a former firefighter, said he was woken up by the sound of fire engine sirens.

He said: 'I looked out of my window and saw smoke billowing out of the upstairs window and thought, I hope no one's hurt. When I saw five fire engines outside, I knew it was serious.'

Police and fire investigators remained at the scene today as inquiries were carried out.

Chief
Superintendent Paul Davies, speaking from the scene, said: 'There is 
nothing to suggest the cause of the fire is suspicious. But now there is
a multi-agency approach to determine the cause.

'Two
young adults and a young child were taken to hospital. The other five 
are either at a hospital, being looked after by police or are with 
friends.

Emergency services were called to the house in Lee Close, Honiton, shortly before 8am

Police have said an investigation is underway, although there was nothing to suggest the cause was suspicious

'It is understood a family member in the house raised the alarm. The house is badly damaged.'

Mr Joslin said: 'From what I can see the fire was pretty extensive. The windows are completely out and it's pretty well blackened.

'There were five fire engines and five ambulances there at one stage. It was a shock looking out and seeing it this morning.

Police and fire investigation officers remained at the scene to carry out their inquiries

'You think, "blimey I do hope nobody's hurt" especially when I didn't hear anything.No explosions or anything like that. I just heard the fire engines going up.'

South Western Ambulance Service said they were called to the incident at 7.36am.

A spokesman said: 'The trust immediately dispatched a number of vehicles including one of the Devon air ambulances. Five ambulances and two officers were also promptly on scene, with the first vehicle arriving within four minutes.

'Members of the Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) were also in attendance. These highly trained paramedics have specialist equipment to deal with this type of situation.

'A number of casualties were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. Four people, all thought to be in a life-threatening condition, have been taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital.'

Neighbour Dave Joslin, a former firefighter, said he was woken up at about 7.30am to the sound of fire engine sirens
