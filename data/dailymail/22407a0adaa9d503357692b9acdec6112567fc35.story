A four-year-old Kansas boy has lost his right leg and could lose his right arm, as well, after his father accidentally backed over him with a riding lawn mower.

Authorities say Scott Shacklett didn't see his young son Truett as he was mowing his yard in Lenexa, Kansas, on Sunday afternoon.

The boy was flown to the hospital and then transferred to the University of Kansas Hospital for surgery.

This is the home where Truett Shacklett, 4, was run over by his father on a riding lawn mower. He had already lost one leg, and could lose an arm as well

Vascular surgeons are still working to repair the damage to his arm so that they will not have to amputate it, KMBC-TV reports.

Little Truett ha already lost his right leg below the knee and will require a prosthetic limb.

Reverend Brian Wright, the pastor at the family's church, told KSHB-TV that Mr Shacklett is 'devastated' by the accident.

The family and their eight children are active at Cedar Ridge Christian Church, Rev Wright said, and are relying on their faith to help them while Truett is in the hospital.

Police say Mr Shacklett flipped over his riding lawn mower as soon as he realized he has run over his son. He pick the boy up and ran him into the house and called 911.

The father, Scott Shacklett, is devastated by the accident. The father of eight is said to be by his son's side day and night

Rev Wright said doctors say Truett's young age is actually an asset. They said he likely won't be nearly as resistant to the prosthetic leg because by the time he is an adult, he will have been wearing it nearly all his life.

The Amputee Coalition said about 600 children lose limbs to mower accidents every year.

Experts recommend that a lawn mower be treated with all the caution of driving a car.
