Vivienne Westwood rarely puts on a show without a hidden political agenda, and the Red Label Autumn/Winter 2014 collection proved no different.

Rather than a discreet nod towards her protest, Vivienne Westwood stamped the words, ‘Fracking We Need to Talk’, across the invitations, and with every guest clutching one, her point was surely made.

Front row seats were occupied by quirky dressers  such as Jessie J, Eliza Doolittle and Paloma Faith who were seen giggling together on the front row.

The privileged woman was the inspiration behind Vivienne Westwood's Red Label collection

Triangle print tights and large Amish style hats were major trends in the collection

The
 collection itself had Westwood written all over it with glorious tartan
 featuring heavily as well as folded tailoring and bulging cleavages 
evoking classic Westwood womanly design.

Vivienne
 Westwood’s Red Label line is inspired by women born into a privileged 
world, which showed in the lady-like ensembles of the collection.

Mid-length
 dresses paired with oversized wool coats and ankle socks gave a chic 
suburban edge while lashings of pearls and faux fur coats gave a nod to 
the Red Label inspiration of the privileged woman.

Although
 there are none of the explicit doodles printed on t-shirts as seen in 
previous seasons, Westwood is never satisfied with a run-of-the-mill 
design and each piece had a hint of mischief.

The Red Label Autumn/Winter 14 collection showcased a softer side of Vivienne Westwood

This season Vivienne Westwood wanted to draw attention to Fracking inviting guests to a Frack Future Ralley

Highlights included miniature bustles sewn into the backs of mini skirts (several worn without underwear) as well as a loose-knit cardigan dress worn with nothing underneath giving peaks of bare flesh.

The collection also featured the newly trending Amish style hat as seen on the likes of Pharrell Williams; recently earning it’s fashion status on the catwalk of Tibi during New York Fashion Week. We anticipate that it’s only a matter of time before the oversized headgear it filters down to the High Street.

Although Vivienne Westwood says the woman who inspires Red Label is privileged she says that this does not prevent her from having a conscience adding that she is ‘engaged with the world and cares about it.’

In hopes to raise awareness about the Fracking, Vivienne Westwood invited all of her guests to the Frack Future Carnival Rally on 19th March at 12:30pm, meeting point at London's Knightsbridge station.

Jessie J and Paloma Faith were seen bonding on the front row

Christopher Kane is the King of cool. His AW14 collection of hypnotic neons, inky black patents and feminine floral lace prints, has fast become a fashion week favourite.

But Christopher didn't want the hair and make-up to distract from his 54 fabric strong organza dresses.

  'Most young designers don't want a huge focus on the hair, they fit the girl to the clothes and want a look that makes the clothes look easier,' Redken extraordinaire, Guido Paolo, told us backstage.

'Christopher didn't want anything too forceful so I've given his models simple, natural hair. It's very undone hair with a great shine and matte texture.'

Guido spritzed on some Redken shine flash to give it a more lanky feel. 'I didn't want much body, nothing too romantic, but something cooler, he said.

'This look is all the things a women dreams of becoming; you can be who you want to be, with a little tweaking.'

As for the make-up, NARS Cosmetics supremo Lucia Pieroni gave Christopher's models a 'glowing tomboy look'.

'It's Brooke shields meets tomboy. The emphasis is on the eyebrows, I've made them straight and filled them in to achieve a straight, bushy and rather dark look,' she explained.

The skin was luminous, simply a swash of the brand's Radiant Cream Compact Foundation and Stick Concealer to highlight and give that 'glow coming out of the darkness.'

The eyes were pink and silvery and Lucia carried the pink shadow down to the ball of the nose, the Cupid's bow and chin to give that radiant lightness. Lips were pink, fresh and a little bit matte, courtesy of Bangkok Pure Matte Lipstick.

'This girl is very Christopher. She's a cool girl, it's all very "him",' added Lucia.
