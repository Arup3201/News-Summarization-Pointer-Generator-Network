An English backpacker has had a Christmas to forget in Australia after falling nearly 30 metres from his apartment's balcony.

Matthew Lehan, 22, spent Christmas day in hospital after surviving the six-storey fall with broken arms and cuts to his face and head.

It is believed he was trying to climb from a seventh-floor balcony in a central Sydney apartment block to his own unit's balcony when he fell at 1am on Thursday, police said.

'This man made a dangerous decision which resulted in serious injuries. It could have resulted in his death, but thankfully it didn’t’, a police spokesperson told Nine News.

When he slipped off the window seal, he fell onto a first floor structure, an almost 30 metre plunge. It is believed he was trying to window hop into his room, which he was locked out of after losing his keys.

The tin sheeting cushioned his fall from the concrete beneath, in turn saving his life.

The man, reported to be an English backpacker, broke both his arms and cut his head and face.

Mr Lehan, who was born in South Africa, is believed to have a permanent home in the UK.

Just a month ago, Mr Lehan posted the following message on his Facebook account

According to previous posts on his Facebook account it would seem it is not the first time Mr Lehan has lost the keys to his apartment. 

In November he wrote that he had lost his key to his room, adding that that was ‘$20 down the toilet’ and he needed a job ‘pronto’.
