The widow of a Hotshot firefighter killed by Arizona wildfires two months ago has given birth to the couple's son.

The child was born on August 22 to Amanda Misner and named Sean Jaxon Herbert Misner after his brave father.

Sean Misner, 26, was one of 19 men engulfed by ferocious, wind-whipped flames on June 30 as they battled the blaze on Yarnell Hill, Arizona.

On the Sean Misner Memorial Facebook page, a message was posted: 'For everything sad we have posted last night something joyous happened.

'At 8:13pm, Sean Jaxon Herbert Misner was born. 6 lbs. 15 oz. 19 3/4 inches tall.

'Congratulations Amanda! We love you and the little guy so very much. Nobody could have been as strong as you needed to be through everything, except for you.'

The couple had originally picked the name Jaxon for their first child but Mrs Misner decided to add Sean following her husband's death. He will be known as Jaxon, according to KPHO.

Baby Sean was born just weeks before his parents were due to celebrate their first wedding anniversary on September 15.

The couple met in 2010 and two years later Sean proposed. Five months later the couple married.

The firefighter found out he was to 
become a father on New Year's Day. Three months later, he began his job 
with the Granite Mountain Hotshots after training for years to realize 
his dream.

The night before he died, he lay next to his wife and spoke to his son so that he could hear his voice, according to a moving family tribute.

Sean Misner was with 18 other Prescott Granite Mountain Hotshots - whose average age was just 27 - when they were outflanked and engulfed by wind-whipped flames in seconds on June 30.Â 

The tragedy is the deadliest single incident for firefighters since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, where as many as 340 crew members lost their lives.

It is also the deadliest wildland blaze for firefighters in the U.S. for 80 years.
