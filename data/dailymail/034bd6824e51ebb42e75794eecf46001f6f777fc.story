Nestled precariously above a sheer cliff, they have the pristine Pacific Ocean views which come with a top dollar price tag.

But sadly for those who dream of the ultimate seaside retreat, these houses are not for sale - nor is anyone likely to live in them again.

The seven huts, constructed from iron and wood, were abandoned to the ravages of time in 1984 after their last occupants were forced out. Now they stand frozen in time, a reminder of a world many never knew existed.  

The seven shacks were built in Sydney's Crater Cove between 1923-63 are now abandoned and frozen in time

The huts made from corrugated iron and wood are scattered on the edge of a cliff deep within the bush of Sydney Harbour National Park

The shacks built between 1923 and 1963 are scattered on the edge of a cliff  deep within the bushland of Sydney Harbour National Park.

It is called Crater Cove and the area, resembling something from a frontier settlement, is one of Sydney's hidden gems.  

The huts, believed to have been made by fisherman for weekend stays, were constructed with the only material available to them - rocks, driftwood, fibro sheets and iron roofing, the Generalist reports.  

The occupants, who were forced out by the National Parks and Wildlife Services in 1984, basically vanished without a trace following a court case where they tried to argue ownership of the land.

The huts have been repaired and maintained since 1990 by caretakers appointed by the national park.

There's old-fashioned storage containers, a gas burner, wok and tea towel that still lie untouched within the kitchen

One of the longest serving residents at Crater Cove was Simon Flynn who moved into his shack in his late teens and was forced out in 1984.

His hut is still reminiscent of the simple living that took place within the tiny community.

Access to the huts hasn't been widely publicised in the past in a bid to manage their conservation

Access to the huts hasn't been widely publicised in the past in a bid to manage their conservation. 

'They are heritage items and they are fragile and there's the need for them to be enjoyed and appreciated and the need to keep them safe,' a national parks spokesperson said.
