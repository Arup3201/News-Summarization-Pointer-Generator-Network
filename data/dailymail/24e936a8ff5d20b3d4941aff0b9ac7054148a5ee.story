Celtic have handed a trial to young Benfica forward Sancidino Silva.

The 20-year-old Guinea-Bissau international is currently out of contract at the Stadium of Light and keen to move on.

He has been training with the Parkhead youth squad in Glasgow as the Scottish champions weigh up a move amid rival interest from Olympiakos and Besiktas.

Should Celtic decide to press ahead, Silva would not require a work permit as he holds a Portuguese passport.

Meanwhile, Nir Biton may have returned to Celtic a married man after a lavish summer wedding, but all his attention is now focused on striving towards a different kind of happy union.

The Champions League is the object of his desire. For Biton, returning to European football’s greatest stage would provide the chance to expunge some painful memories from his debut season at Parkhead.

He made three appearances in the group stage last term, all of which brought varying shades of anguish.

Little more than 60 seconds of a 2-0 defeat in Milan was followed by a late introduction against Ajax at Parkhead. That, however, lasted just 11 minutes before a clattering challenge on Thulani Serero earned Biton a red card and the wrath of manager Neil Lennon.

He was free of suspension in time to start the final game against Barcelona, only for that to morph into another nightmare as Celtic were routed 6-1.

This wasn’t quite how the Israeli imagined it working out after moving from FC Ashdod last August.

The 22-year-old midfielder’s season was then curtailed by a torn groin muscle sustained on international duty but he is back under new boss Ronny Deila determined to make a more substantial mark.

Helping the club qualify for the Champions League is key, with the first qualifier against KR Reykjavik now just a fortnight away.

‘The Champions League is so important to a club like Celtic,’ Biton admitted. ‘We want to get to the group stage and, although it will be tough, I believe we can do it.

‘Last year, the Champions League was not so good for me but I have tried to learn from the red card against Ajax. I was a split second late for the ball and paid the price - but next time, hopefully, I will do it differently.

‘Sometimes these things can make you stronger, because after the red card I was extremely down.

‘My first few months at Celtic were a shock for me but experiences like that can only make you a better player.

‘It was difficult at first. I didn’t start the season that well. I was at a new club, with new team-mates and a new coach.

'I didn’t know about the expectations of the club and the football was so  different to what I was used to in Israel. It took me some time but  eventually I settled down and started to play better before my injury.

‘Football is all about confidence and you need to start to believe you can perform. I feel good now about myself, the team and the coach.’ 

The 
positivity extends to Biton’s  personal life after his marriage to wife 
Bar during the close season. The big day was happily concluded, despite 
some pre-match jitters.

‘It was the best day of my life,’ he grinned. ‘It was a great party at night with about 600 guests.

Hitched: Nir Bilton returns to Celtic training after a summer wedding in Israel

‘We celebrate weddings differently in Israel and I was probably more nervous before that than I would be before a big game. But, once I had a few drinks, I was OK.

‘It was a great occasion but I didn’t have time for a honeymoon because I was injured last year and wanted to get back fit for pre-season with the new manager and staff at Celtic.

‘Everyone wants to prove themselves to the new coach. Neil (Lennon) has left and it’s a fresh start for all of us.

‘The atmosphere has been great so far and we are looking forward to  the new season.’
