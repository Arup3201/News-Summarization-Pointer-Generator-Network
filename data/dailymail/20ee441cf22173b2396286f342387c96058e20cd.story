A three-year-old girl is in a 'critical' condition in hospital after being shot in the head by her four-year-old brother, police have said.

The unnamed toddler and her sibling were allegedly playing in a room at their home in Lorain, northeastern Ohio, on Sunday morning when the boy picked up a loaded gun.

Seconds later, he accidentally pulled the trigger, causing a bullet to pierce his sister's head, according to authorities. Three other family members were reportedly in the house at the time.

Police and paramedics were called to the property on the 1300 block of West 28th Street at around 10am, where they discovered the girl's father cradling her in his arms. 

The youngster was flown to Rainbow Babies Hospital Children's Hospital in Cleveland with a single gunshot wound, the Lorain Police Department told Cleveland.com. She remains in a 'critical' state.

Following the shooting, investigators interviewed the three other people who were in the house at the time. They also recovered the gun from the scene.

Prosecutors are now reviewing the incident to determine if charges will be filed.

It is not the first time a young child has accidentally shot a sibling with a loaded weapon.

In April, a three-year-old girl killed her two-year-old brother after shooting him in the stomach with a .22-caliber rifle at their home in Utah.

Although emergency crews arrived within minutes and rushed the badly wounded toddler  to a local hospital, he could not be saved.

Police later said the girl had picked up the gun after her father had placed it down and walked away. 

In  Sunday's shooting, the police investigation is ongoing.
