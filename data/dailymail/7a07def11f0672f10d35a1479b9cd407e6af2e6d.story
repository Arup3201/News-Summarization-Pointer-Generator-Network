Manchester City may not have any Manchester boys in their first-team squad these days but the Burnley backline was packed with local talent. Kieran Trippier, a Bury boy, and Sale-born Ben Mee rose through the youth system at City before exiting for Burnley after the Middle East takeover. Centre half Michael Keane, on loan from Manchester United, is from South Manchester while goalkeeper Tom Heaton is also a product of the United academy.

This was only the second Premier League game that City have played without Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero in the matchday squad. The only previous occasion came in March 2013, when Roberto Mancini’s City lost 2-0 at Everton.

Ashley Barnes’ equaliser denied City a club-record 10th consecutive victory in all competitions. City secured a ninth win in a row against West Brom on Boxing Day, replicating a feat previously achieved in the 2011-12 season and in 1912.

This game may have been 48 hours after Burnley’s 1-0 defeat by Liverpool but the Clarets showed no sign of fatigue despite Sean Dyche naming an unchanged team and not making any substitutions during the game. As City flagged, Burnley only got stronger.
