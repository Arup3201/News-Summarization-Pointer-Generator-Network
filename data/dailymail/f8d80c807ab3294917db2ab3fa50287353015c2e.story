A family of 14 foxes have been killed after they burrowed deep into the walls of a London park reservoir

A family of foxes have been shot dead after nearly caused catastrophic flooding when they burrowed deep into the walls of a reservoir.

Council officials ordered the 14 foxes to be killed after the holes were discovered in the structure of a dam wall in London.

They said the holes risked creating structural damage to the dam, putting 80 homes at risk of flooding.

But wildlife experts said the cull will not solve the problem at Danson Park, Bexleyheath, as more foxes are likely to colonise the empty den and keep burrowing.

Urban wildlife consultant John Bryant, who is working with Bexley Council, said: ‘Shooting the foxes is pointless because within three days new ones will move in.

‘The burrowing into the embankment will weaken it and the foxes will keep digging if they can.

‘The bank needs to be dealt with it and that is what I will be looking at with the council.’

Not all residents supported the operation.

David Chamberlain, 54, who lives nearby, said: ‘The park is a nature reserve and you expect there to be wildlife. I think it’s inhumane and sickening.

‘The traps were very loud, imagine a gate clanging, that is how loud it was and I heard it twice from my house.’

An officer with Bexley Pest Control said: ‘I have worked in pest control for more than 20 years and never heard of foxes burrowing that deep, they would have to be super foxes to do that.

‘They normally burrow under garden sheds, I have never heard of them causing structural damage.’

A spokesman for Bexley Council added: ‘The pest control operation involved foxes that had burrowed into the structure of the Danson Dam.'

Wildlife experts have warned the cull will not stop the problem at Danson Park, Bexleyheath (pictured), as more foxes will move in and colonise the empty den

‘As the owner of the dam it is our responsibility to ensure that it remains in good condition. Failure of the dam would place more than 80 local properties at risk of serious flooding.

‘Before deciding on the best course of action we thoroughly investigated all the pest control measures available.

‘B & D Pest Control carried out the operation using approved methods.

‘They are licensed to use firearms with considerable experience in this kind of pest control.

‘The company informed Bexleyheath police who raised no objections and the foxes were humanely destroyed on the night of the operation using firearms.

‘Our engineers are now in discussion with a wildlife specialist to find a longer term solution that will discourage future attention from foxes.’
