A two-year-old boy has been killed after he was struck by a train while walking a dog alone along a railway track near his home in Kentucky.

The youngster, who has been named as Trayton Joiner, was struck by the train after wandering onto a level crossing with the pet in Hopkinsville.

It is believed that the train driver saw the dog first, and then the child, but couldn't brake in time and the train hit both the boy and the animal.

Two-year-old Trayton Joiner is believed to have been struck by a train while walking alone with a dog near to this level crossing in Hopkinsville, Kentucky 

The two-year-old was rushed to the Jennie Stuart Medical Centre but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. 

Police spokesman Paul Ray said that the emergency services were called by the train's driver.

He added that officers were forced to go door-to-door to find the child's home. They eventually found the boy's mother, who was taken to hospital to see her son.

Police are still trying to determine why the boy was by himself and believe he may have been following the dog.

Mr Ray told WSMV: 'We don't know if the dog was leading the boy or vice versa, but the conductor tried to stop and did everything he could to stop.'

It is not clear if the dog belonged to the boy's family.

The two-year-old was taken to the Jennie Stuart Medical Centre in Kentucky, pictured, but later died from his injuries 

The train, which had two locomotives and was pulling 106 empty coal cars, was travelling from Nashville, Tennesse to Madisonville, Kentucky.

Rob Doolittle, a spokesman for the train operator CSX Corp, said: It's a tragic situation and our sympathies are with the family involved.'

Meanwhile the dog, a female pit-bull mix which was also struck was taken to Skyline Animal Clinic in Hopkinsville. According to staff there, the animal is expected to survive.
