Screening older people for early dementia when they visit their GP could do more harm than good, a leading expert has warned.

Dr Chris Fox said the plans were ‘a disaster in slow motion’ because people without symptoms could be wrongly diagnosed and have their lives thrown into turmoil.

He believes patients with minor memory problems could drain the NHS of vital resources needed for those who have conditions such as Alzheimer’s.

Around one in three older people will develop some form of cognitive impairment or memory problem – which can be picked up in tests but may never lead to full-blown dementia.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt thinks doctors are refusing to carry out tests because there is no effective cure available.

He is pushing for GPs to screen people for signs of dementia even if they do not have obvious symptoms.

But Dr Fox, an old-age psychiatry specialist at the University of East Anglia, has raised concerns about the impact the tests will have on patients.

He said: ‘Routine screening means that people will be diagnosed long before they start to show symptoms. A diagnosis can turn someone’s life upside down years before dementia itself does.

‘On a personal level, just knowing that you have this illness coming will lead to all sorts of problems – from profound anxiety and stress for the patient and their families, to a loss of independence, an impact on their career if they are still working and social isolation.

'And all of this before symptoms are obvious.’

Dr Fox predicted that vast sums of money would have to be diverted to people who will have a raised expectation of treatment and support at a time when the NHS is struggling to cope with those already diagnosed with dementia.

He added: ‘Current tests are not particularly robust and there is a relatively high risk of misdiagnosis so all of this turmoil could be even more unnecessary.

‘It is unfair to cause fear and concern when treatments are not available, the chances of the condition actually progressing are not clear, and when symptoms may never take hold in the patient’s lifetime.

‘Dementia is an undeniable concern for ageing societies, but the key is a more timely and swift diagnosis when symptoms become apparent – not routine screening.’

The UK National Screening Committee concluded in 2010 that screening for Alzheimer’s ‘should not be offered’ as it failed to find evidence that it would be beneficial.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘We agree with the Screening Committee that there is no justification for screening the whole population for Alzheimer’s.’

However, Andrew Chidgey, from the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Population screening is inappropriate, but asking older people at high risk about their memory is vital.

'Suggesting people are kept in the dark is a retrograde step. The medical profession must not bury its head in the sand over tackling the condition.’
