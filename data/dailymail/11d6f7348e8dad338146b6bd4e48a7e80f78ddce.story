It was a roar of relief as much as of joy. But Tiger Woods' reaction as he holed his final putt in the lengthening shadows yesterday evening said one thing - I'm back.

Woods landed his first victory since the 2009 sex scandal that rocked his career and soured his reputation.

Wearing his signature red shirt the champion golfer beat his partner Graeme McDowell at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida. 

With the Masters just two weeks away it will be a relief for Woods, who walked off the green victoriously waving his cap to the raucous crowd.

'It does feel good. It feels really good,' he said after his five-shot victory over McDowell. 'It's been a lot of hard work

'I am excited, no doubt. I'm looking forward to the momentum I've built here.'

But there is more hard work ahead of him as he fights to play down the hype surrounding his former swing coach’s tell-all book which goes on sale Tuesday. 

The Big Miss by Hank Haney raises questions about Woods' fascination with the Navy SEALs and whether that contributed to his recent injuries.

Written off: Woods called Haney¿s anecdotes 'one-sided' and a cheap way to earn money. 'I'm not going to waste my time reading it,' he said

It portrays Woods as self-centered and rarely satisfied, a side of him that Woods has sought to keep private for so many years.

It also delves into the turbulent 
relationships of Woods’ past, with details of his controlling attitude 
toward former wife Elin Nordegren whom he banned from smiling on the 
golf course. 

Woods has already spent the last two years battling to clear his name.

The 14-times major champion spearheaded a 
sports brand generating about $100 million a year in royalties before 
his private life imploded two years ago.

He
was widely believed to be the world's wealthiest athlete before his 
string of marital infidelities led to the break-up of his marriage, 
losing five major sponsors in the fallout.

He allegedly confessed to cheating with as many as 120 women behind his wife’s back during their five-year marriage.

They included former Playboy model Loredana Jolie Ferriolo and his 'number one mistress',nightclub promoter Rachel Uchitel.

Nordegren divorced him in 2010.
