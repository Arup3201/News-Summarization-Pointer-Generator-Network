Doctors using Skype to check on a patient at home helped save her husband’s life when he collapsed in front of them.

Medics were monitoring kidney patient Brenda Griffin via the internet when they saw her husband, Peter, who was sitting next to her, keel over.

The hospital staff immediately dialled 999 and told Mrs Griffin how she could unlink herself from her kidney dialysis machine so she could help her 70-year-old husband.

Paramedics were alerted and he was was rushed to hospital where it was discovered he had bowel cancer.

Mrs Griffin, 65, from Draycott, near Derby, said: 'I don’t know what would have happened if we hadn’t been using Skype that day.

'Skype had already given me my life back because it meant I could have my treatment at home. Now it’s saved my husband as well.'

Royal Derby Hospital is one of the first in England to use Skype internet video technology to speak to patients at home.

Mrs Griffin had been attending three days a week to be hooked up to a dialysis machine for four hours at a time.

But the treatment was gruelling and left her exhausted, so doctors came up with an alternative solution.

Instead of traipsing into hospital, she would be able to stay at home to have her dialysis treatment, speaking face to face with staff at the hospital’s renal unit via Skype on her Kindle tablet.

Mrs Griffin, a retired receptionist, said: 'My husband had set up the machine for me but it was one of those days where we were having problems with it, so I decided to Skype the unit.

'While I was talking, Peter suddenly said he didn’t feel well. He sat down and then, all of a sudden, he passed out.

'The hospital was asking what was going on as Peter came around. He went to go and mop his brow but then he passed out again.

'At this point, I was tied up to my machine so I couldn’t do anything. Peter normally helps me out with it.

'So the hospital sent out for the paramedics and then guided me on how to take myself off it. By the time I had managed to take the needles out, the paramedics had arrived.

'If it hadn’t been for Skype, I don’t know what would have happened. It’s a wonderful thing.'

Mr Griffin, a retired British Rail supervisor, was taken to hospital after his collapse last November.

Tests revealed he had collapsed and felt unwell because he was suffering from bowel cancer.

Doctors operated on him the following month and he is now receiving lower doses of chemotherapy at home, through tablets.

The hospital is hoping to extend Skype consultations to other departments.
