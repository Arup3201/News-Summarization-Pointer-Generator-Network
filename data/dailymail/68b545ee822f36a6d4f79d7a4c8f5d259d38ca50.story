Criticism: Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘The recording of information under RIPA is lamentably poor'

Police are misusing controversial anti-terror powers to spy on journalists’ phone records, a damning report by MPs will reveal today.

Using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) to unmask whistleblowers who help reporters made it ‘not fit for purpose’.

Members of the Home Affairs Select Committee claim ‘lamentably’ poor records were kept of those who were targeted using the snooping legislation – making the process appear ‘secretive and disorganised’.

Poor scrutiny also meant the police abused the powers without censure, they add. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The recording of information under RIPA is lamentably poor.

‘We are concerned that the level of secrecy surrounding the use of RIPA allows investigating authorities to engage in acts which should be unacceptable in a democracy.

‘Using RIPA to access telephone records of journalists is wrong and must cease.’

The report follows two high-profile investigations in which detectives secretly accessed data from reporters at The Sun and The Mail on Sunday to unmask whistleblowers in cases involving senior politicians. 

Police are usually required to go to court to access a journalist’s sources. But RIPA powers require only that a request to access information is approved by a high-ranking police officer.

Police and the security sources obtained communications records under the controversial legislation at a rate of about 10,000 a week. Some 88 per cent of requests were by the police.

The MPs’ report says: ‘RIPA is not fit for purpose, with law enforcement agencies failing to routinely record the professions of individuals who have had their communications data accessed.

‘The recording of information under RIPA is totally insufficient, and the whole process appears secretive and disorganised with information being destroyed afterwards.’

It adds: ‘We fully share the concern of journalists that their sources of information should be fully protected.’

The report said the Home Office should update the RIPA Code of Practice over dealings with journalists’ sources.

It also recommended that the Home Secretary Theresa May used a review into whether the police are deliberately bypassing legal protections to ensure that they use RIPA powers properly.
