A British Airways flight from Gatwick to Glasgow was hit by lightning, causing panic among passengers on board.

After the pilot was forced to change the direction of the landing at the Scottish airport due to high winds, the Airbus A319 was hit by a lightning bolt on the descent.

One passenger on board the BA 2958 flight described how people began to panic after witnessing a loud bang and a flash of orange, with one man fainting and others praying.

'On the descent there was a loud bang and a flash of orange light. People thought it was the engine. But when we landed the pilot explained that we had been hit by lightning,' Craig Denholm told MailOnline Travel.

'I thought we had maybe hit a bird or something. But the plane was eerily silent on the descent after that.' 

Mr Denholm described how one man fainted during the incident, while children began to cry and others started to pray.

On landing and once the passengers were allowed to disembark, the plane was checked by engineers, who are continuing to inspect the plane.

'A BA spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'The aircraft landed safely and engineers are carrying out an inspection before it returns to London. The safety of our customers and crew is always our top priority.

'Lightning strikes are fairly common, and aircraft are designed to cope with them.

'We have apologised to customers due to travel to London on the aircraft this afternoon for the delay to their flight and are re-booking as many as possible onto services departing later this afternoon.'

The return flight back to Gatwick from Glasgow is delayed by at least three-and-a-half hours

One passenger at Glasgow Airport got in touch with MailOnline Travel explaining the knock-on effect the incident has had on her flight.

Emily Galletly was scheduled to fly on the same plane back to Gatwick at 1.30pm, but passengers have now been told more information will be given at 5pm.

'Gatwick flight delayed as plane struck by lightning needs to be looked at by engineers! #BritishAirways,' she tweeted.
