A Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder – one of only five of the supercars in the UK – has been seized by police after officers discovered its driver didn't hold a full licence.

When officers ran an insurance check, 
they discovered that the driver of the £157,000 supercar was only on a 
provisional driving licence and so not covered by insurance.

The car was taken after the driver was pulled over by police for speeding on Sheen Road in Richmond-on-Thames in Surrey.

Police from Richmond's Safer Transport Team seized the supercar while on covert patrol in an unmarked police last Thursday.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that the driver will face punishment.

The spokesman said: ‘The driver of the 
high performance sports car will be appearing in court for the driving 
offences and potentially receiving a driving ban, penalty points and a 
large fine as a result of his actions.’

The rare supercar can reach speeds of up to 200mph, accelerating to 62mph in just over four seconds.

The Gallardo was the first Lamborghini developed under Audi ownership.

In October last year an American teenager died after the Lamborghini Gallardo she was driving crashed and caught fire in Abu Dhabi. 

Despite firefighters arriving on the scene in Defence Road within four minutes and extinguishing the fire, she could not be freed in time.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced in September last year that all Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe and Spyder models built in 2004 - 06 would be recalled over a potential fire risk.
