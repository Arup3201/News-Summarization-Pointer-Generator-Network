Not our fault? Tim Yeo, chair of the Commons energy and climate change committee, says the temperature rise may be a natural process

Global warming may not be caused by mankind, the MP who scrutinises government policy on climate change said last night.

Tim Yeo, who chairs the Commons energy and climate change committee, accepted that the earth’s temperature is rising.

But he said it was possible that the increase could be down to ‘natural phases’ in the earth’s climate, and that human action is merely a ‘possible cause’.

Mr Yeo, who was an environment minister under John Major, has previously spoken with great certainty about the impact of mankind on climate change and he is one of the Conservative Party’s strongest advocates of cutting carbon emissions.

But on Tuesday night he downplayed the impact of climate change, saying it posed ‘no threat’ to the survival of the planet and that the causes are ‘not absolutely clear’.

Asked whether it was better to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change than to prevent it, he said: ‘The first thing to say is it does not represent any threat to the survival of the planet. None at all.

‘The planet has survived much bigger changes than any climate change that is happening now.

‘Although I think the evidence that the climate is changing is now overwhelming, the causes are not absolutely clear. There could be natural causes, natural phases that are taking place.’

But he said governments should continue to cut carbon emissions, because there was still ‘a risk’ that global warming is caused by mankind.

‘There is at least a risk that the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a possible cause,’ he said, adding that it was ‘prudent’ to be ‘efficient in the use of energy’.

Uncertainty: Mr Yeo says the causes of climate change are 'not clear'

Mr Yeo’s scepticism puts him at odds with the scientific community. A recent survey of 12,000 academic papers on climate change found 97 per cent agree that human activities are causing the planet to warm.

The MP’s comments are particularly surprising in light of some of his previous comments on the issue.

He said in 2009: ‘A significant number of core Conservative voters, mostly among older people, are reluctant to accept the evidence.

'I don’t think they will be a significant influence in the next parliament and will gradually diminish in the population … In five years’ time, no one will argue about a man-made contribution to climate change.’

'The dying gasps of the deniers will be put to bed. In five years’ time, no one will argue about a man-made contribution to climate change.”’

Mr Yeo, who was speaking to an audience of energy industry representatives and diplomats at the Westminster Russia Forum, renewed his call for the Government to build a third runway at Heathrow. He said waiting for Sir Howard Davies’ report on aviation capacity which is due after the next election was a ‘ludicrous response to a clear national need’.

He said without better air links to east Asia, Europe risks becoming a ‘sort of third world backwater quite quickly’.

Asked about the comments on climate change yesterday, Mr Yeo told the Telegraph: ‘It is possible there are natural causes as well, but my view has always been that - for twenty years - I have thought the scientific evidence has been very convincing.

‘The strong probability is that it is man-made causes contributing to greenhouse gas concentrations.’
