She's a glamorous mother-of-two, feted for her fashion nous and extensive charity work, but now Spain's Queen Letizia has had a tribute of a very different kind - a Simpsons style makeover.

The Spanish monarch has been transformed into a cartoon character by Italian artist AlexsandroÂ  Palombo, who says the royal has impressed him with her 'strength' and 'determination'.

'Queen Letizia perfectly represents the ideal modern woman,' he added. 'She's strong, determined and committed to supporting important social causes.'

Her strength and determination certainly come across in Palombo's cartoons, which include one that shows her riding a bull while in full military uniform.

Another shows her in one of her trademark glamorous gowns standing in front of the Zarzuela Palace with a mini bull on a lead.

'She has a fresh, cool look which is far from the usual royal aesthetic,' explains Palombo. 'I think it's very important that there are women like her in our society in order to support important ideals such as equal rights between men and women.'

But Letizia isn't the first royal lady to feature in Palombo's work. His last project gave the Duchess of Cambridge a Simpsons-style makeover and the Queen has herself been featured in a Springfield-inspired cartoon.

Hard at work: Despite it being her 42nd birthday, Queen Letizia spent the day at a journalism awards ceremony

His pen has also touched on famous beauties such as Kim Kardashian as well as iconic fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld and US Vogue editor, Anna Wintour.

'I captured the essence of her femininity and I've chosen outfits that represent her style,' added Palombo.

'She has an elegant personality but at the same time she is a bit irreverent, so she is perfect for an episode of The Simpsons.'

Letizia, who celebrated her 42nd birthday yesterday, spent the day hard at work, attending the Luis Carandell Journalism Awards ceremony at the Senate Palace in Madrid and making a speech.

Non-stop: Letizia's appearance at the Luis Carandell Journalism Awards was the latest stop in a busy schedule

Resplendent in a rose print lilac and cream dress, the mother-of-two looked every inch the queen as she spoke to guests.

Her latest appearance comes hot on the heels of a frenetic week, which included a visit from the president and first lady of Panama and several charity meetings.

On Friday, she dressed down in a simple grey t-shirt and jeans as she and husband King Felipe, 46, took their daughters Leonor and Sofia to school as the new academic year began.

The rest of the month is also set to be a busy one for Letizia and her husband courtesy of a busy schedule of appointments at home, before a visit to New York at the end of September where Felipe will address the UN General Assembly.
