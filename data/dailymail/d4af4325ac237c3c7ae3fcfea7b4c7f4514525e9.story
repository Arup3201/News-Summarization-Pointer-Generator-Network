A recording-breaking adventurer from North Wales has claimed the title of National Adventurer of the Year following his epic journey across landlocked Mongolia.

Ash Dykes, 24, who is nicknamed the 'lonely snow leopard', last year impressively spent 78 days alone, crossing 1,500 miles of the unforgiving Gobi Desert and the vast Mongolian steppe. 

The prestigious awards are a celebration of the most impressive international adventure, and Ash beat 39 other competitors to take the title of Wales' top adventurer.

 Mongolia is the most sparsely populated country on earth, with just over three million inhabitants

Famous English explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, who was the first person to reach both poles, commended the Welshman, saying his feat was 'an example of great determination.' 

Fittingly the award was presented by a Mongolian dignitary, at the Grand Central Hotel in Glasgow, and the prize given was a traditional Mongol bowl and framed certificate. 

'I thought it was really appropriate as I had walked across his country,' Ash said.

Mongolia is the most sparsely populated country on earth, with just over three million inhabitants in its vast land-locked 604,000 square miles.

After 78 days of travelling alone Ash became the first known person to walk across Mongolia

Ash, 24, battled raging sandstorms and crippling heat as he crossed the barren land

Battling sandstorms, heat exhaustion and loneliness, Ash completed the incredible mission on foot and unsupported, which helped him secure the top award.

He said: 'I feel humbled to have received the most votes. I would like to say how proud I feel and I didn't expect such support from the public.' 

His 'snow leopard' nicknamed was given by amazed locals who learned of his solo crossing and likened him to the resilient solitary creatures who roam the Mongolian wilderness.

Ash is currently in the middle of a UK tour called 'Ash Dykes - Breaking Mongolia: The Lonely Snow Leopard'

For the duration of his mission from the western Russian border, to the easterly Chinese border, Ash dragged a 265lb home-made trailer containing food packs, water butts and camping equipment.

His perseverance even saw him travel 34 miles in one day, walking for 14 hours straight at an altitude of more than 8,000ft.

Since Ash left home at 19, he has embarked on more adventures than most people do in a lifetime.

From surviving in the Alps to living among a Burmese hill tribe, his experiences have led to him becoming a motivational speaker - visiting 10 Downing Street and filming his own documentary along the way - and he even has a book deal.

Ash is also currently in the middle of a 10-date UK tour called 'Ash Dykes - Breaking Mongolia: The Lonely Snow Leopard', which began in March and continues into April. 

'I am in preparation for my next world first adventure now. It is something no one has done before and I will be revealing it very soon,' he said. 

The plucky explorer is opening up his next tour in July or August in Northern Mongolia.
