Jason Thomas has been jailed for three and a half years after he duped trust fund manager Luisa Smith out of £175,000

A personal fitness trainer who told a trust fund manager he loved her to dupe her out of £175,000, which he spent on an extravagant lifestyle, has been jailed for three and a half years.

Jason Thomas, 42, convinced Luisa Smith, 35, to send him the cash by claiming he needed to pay off drug debts.

Thomas told 'infatuated' Smith that he would use some of the money to buy a house with her, Southwark Crown Court heard.

But he fuelled his 'delusions of grandeur' by splashing out on designer watches, a jet-ski and a jaunt to Thailand with a second woman he intended to fleece.

He also bought expensive art work, an Audi TT and a Mercedes SLK Kompressor with his ill-gotten gains.

Smith, a trust fund manager at Capita Trustees in Jersey, was jailed for two years in 2011 after plundering two high profile accounts.

She even remortgaged her flat for £40,000 and took out loans totalling £286,000 to help the man she was ‘smitten’ with, but didn’t see a penny of it herself.

The cash was sent back to Thomas via the bank account of former Credit Suisse banker, Rory Codd, 34, who was cleared of involvement in the scam.

Money channelled through Codd’s account was used to fund extravagant purchases including £40,000 in down-payments for a custom-built boat in 2009.

It was claimed Codd also supplied the down payment for the Mercedes SLK Kompressor and the Thai holiday but he was cleared of conspiracy to acquire criminal property.

Thomas, who did not give evidence during the trial at Southwark Crown Court, was convicted of fraud and conspiracy to acquire criminal property.

He showed little emotion as the guilty verdicts were announced.

After meeting Thomas through a friend, Smith immediately fell in love with him when they kissed on a date in 2008.

Within months, he was begging for cash to pay off his so-called drug debts. Smith paid £40,000 into his account in a ‘test run’ on June 27, 2009, before a further payment of £98,000 was made to Codd from a trust fund she was looking after.

The scam emerged in August 2009, when Smith went on holiday and unusual payments were discovered by colleagues.

She was later sacked and jailed after being convicted of two counts of fraud.

Giving evidence Smith said she lost her sense of perspective towards the end of the scam.

‘It got to a stage where I didn’t know what was right and what was wrong, in my frame of mind at the time’, she said.

‘I knew it wasn’t right - it was wrong what I was doing because it was theft. But it didn’t cross my mind what the consequences of all this were.’

She was arrested when she returned from holiday in August 2009, and eventually confessed all to police.

She said it was a ‘blessed relief’ to be able to confess all.

‘I feel disgusted with myself, and embarrassed with the shame I have brought on my family’, she said.

‘On various occasions, I tried to take my life by committing suicide, not to end my life but to end the situation I was in.’

Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said Thomas ‘used this woman to fund an extravagant lifestyle'.

He said: ‘Jason Thomas has delusions of grandeur and has an over-inflated feeling of self-worth which his personal training could not satisfy.

‘He targeted a woman in a good job and he told her that he needed her cash because he was in debt to drug dealers or that his own clients had not paid him. And so the woman paid up wanting to impress the man she loved.

‘He said if she loved him she would be happy to give him money and help clear his debts,’ Ms Karmy-Jones added.

Thomas, from South Woodford, Essex, was convicted of conspiracy to acquire criminal property and fraud.

Codd, from Kilburn, north west London, was cleared of conspiracy to acquire criminal property.

Thomas’ brother, Steven, 43, from Brentwood, Essex, was earlier cleared on the judge’s direction of conspiracy to acquire criminal property and a further count of acquiring criminal property.

Jailing Thomas for three and a half years, Judge Michael Grieve QC refused to comment on his claim that he received Luisa Smith’s cash for the ‘sexual services’ he provided her.

He said: ‘You persistently and inexhaustibly hounded Luisa for money for approximately two to three years.

‘She was overwhelmed by the love you professed for her. She had not been in a relationship for some years and was someone who lacked self-confidence.

‘She suffered from depression for which she was taking medication. She worked throughout this time for Capita, a trust fund administrator.

'She decided to steal money from a trust administered by her. You were undoubtedly the driving force behind this conspiracy.

‘As has been established in this process, you used your personal charm, lies and possession of expensive assets like cars and boats’.

Judge Grieve added: ‘You obtained almost £100,000 from other resources to which she had access, including her parents’.

Smith had even handed over an inheritance from her godfather, the judge said.

The court was told Thomas had an extensive criminal record, including handling stolen goods in 1994, blackmail in 1995, common assault in 2001, possession of MDMA in 2002, assault occasioning ABH in 2008 and common assault in 2013.
