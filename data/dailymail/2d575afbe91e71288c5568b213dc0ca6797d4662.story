Wayne Rooney has sung Michael Carrick's praises after his cameo against Italy on Tuesday night, saying the England midfielder was the best player on the pitch 'by a mile'.

Carrick, who plays with Rooney at Manchester United, replaced Chris Smalling towards the end of the first half with Roy Hodgon's side struggling at 1-0 down.

But England went on to level courtesy of an Andros Townsend stunner, and Rooney believes Carrick played a huge part in the friendly draw.

'The best player on the pitch by a mile was Michael Carrick,' Rooney told ITV after the game. 

'He came on and dictated the game for us you - saw how much control we had after that. I think he was the big difference between two teams in second half.'

Ross Barkley was also introduced in the second half and impressed alongside Townsend and Carrick at the Juventus Stadium, as England bounced back after Graziano Pelle's opener.

Hodgson also reserved praise for United midfielder Carrick, who has only been capped 33 times by his country.

He said: 'Michael did very well. We experimented in first half, Jones did well, but we missed players like Carrick and Wilshere. 

'There might come a game when we need a Phil Jones-type in midfield.'
