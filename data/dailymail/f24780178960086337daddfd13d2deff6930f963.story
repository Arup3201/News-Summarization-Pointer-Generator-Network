Residents of the small Connecticut town Newtown have turned their attention and support to the local high school football team as the one-year anniversary of one of America's worst mass shootings approaches.

The Newtown High School Hawks completed an undefeated season on Tuesday night, with players dedicating their sport to the victims of last December's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The footballers have been wearing the number 26 on their helmets to commemorate the 20 children and six adult educators killed during the December 14 shooting by 2--year-old gunman Adam Lanza.

The logo also features green, which is the school's official color.

The Nighthawks finished the season with a record 12-0 after beating out arch rival Masuk High School 42-7.

The blowout win on Tuesday night gave the team a leg up in its quest for a state championship by securing top seed in the playoff tournament that starts next week.

'Our players are hungry to win the championship to give everyone in town a great Christmas present and something to feel happy about a year after such a horrible tragedy,' said Newtown High's head football coach, Steve George.

If Newtown makes it to the championship game, it is likely to be played on December 13 or 14, George said.

The latter date would coincide with the anniversary of the shootings.

Quarterback Andrew Tarantino said winning a championship would be particularly poignant this year.

'Obviously, what our team and community went through the past year was really tough, but we just want to put a smile on everyone's face by bringing home a state championship,' said the 17-year-old senior, who has broken all the school's quarterback records.

'There’s a lot of good things going on here . . . that sometimes get overshadowed by all the negative things that go on, but I guess that’s what news is sometimes.'

The win against Monroe, Newtown's direct neighbor, was bittersweet.

When Sandy Hook was closed indefinitely after the shooting, Monroe quickly refurbished one of their campuses, Chalk Hill School, which had been closed the year before, to accommodate Sandy Hook students.

Adam Lanza, 20, opened fire inside the school killing 20 first-graders and six educators before killing himself as police arrived on Dec. 14, 2012

The school is still home to Sandy Hook students - as the original school was demolished to make way for a new $57 million complex, as voted for by members of the town following the shooting - and has temporarily been renamed Sandy Hook. 

The tiny All-American town of Newtown will likely forever be known for last year's devastating tragedy.

Because of its small population - about 26,000 - every resident was somehow touched by the shooting.

While none of the football team’s players reportedly had any relation to victims of the tragedy, about 10-15 had gone to elementary school at Sandy Hook, as had two coaches.

The Nighthawks win comes as Sandy Hook is thrust back into the news following the release of a 48-page report concluding the case is now closed.

While the report provided new details on Lanza, saying that he was fascinated by violence, particularly the Columbine High School massacre, it determined that his motive is 'a question (that) may never be answered conclusively'.
