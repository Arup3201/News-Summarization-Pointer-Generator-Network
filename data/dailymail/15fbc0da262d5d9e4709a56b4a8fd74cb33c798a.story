A nurse who admitted falling asleep three times during an 'end of life' care meeting with the family of a terminally ill patient has been allowed to continue working.

Abosede Sanusi was also found to have incorrectly stated a patient was ready to be discharged and inaccurately completed two patient assessments during a three-month spell in 2012 as a staff nurse at Southend University Hospital, where she failed two medication assessments.

She was cleared of a charge of falsifying records in which it was claimed she scribbled out two incorrect entries stating a dead patient was sleeping.

Staff nurse Abosede Sanusi admitted falling asleep three times during an 'end of life' meeting at Southend University Hospital in 2012

The charges came to light while Sanusi was being supervised through a mentorship programme at the hospital.

Following a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing at the Old Bailey, Sanusi was only handed an 18-month conditions of practice order, allowing her to continue to work as a nurse while being closely monitored by the NMC.

An NMC panel described the nurse's actions as 'deplorable' stating they had brought the profession in to disrepute. 

Panel chairman Tim Skelton said: 'Your falling asleep during a very sensitive meeting held to discuss the 'end of life' care with a patient's relatives was unacceptable.

'The panel acknowledged that you made an early admission in this respect.

'However it noted that you have not demonstrated a full understanding of the implications of your actions upon the reputation of the profession.

'The panel concluded that your actions in falling asleep three times during such a sensitive meeting were serious and brought the profession into disrepute.

'Similarly ... your inappropriate behaviour by raising your voice on a ward and in front of patients, visitors and colleagues was deplorable.'

The staff nurse has since left Southend University Hospital, although the organisation has refused to confirm if she was sacked or resigned.

Sue Hardy, chief nurse at the hospital, said: 'We note the findings of the NMC hearing and can confirm that Ms Sanusi no longer works for the trust.'
