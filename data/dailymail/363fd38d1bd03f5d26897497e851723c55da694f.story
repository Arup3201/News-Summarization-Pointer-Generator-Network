A Victorian nun known as the Mother Theresa of Manchester has moved a step closer to sainthood today after Vatican officials approved her life's work as worthy of canonisation.

Sister Elizabeth Prout, who lived and worked in the slums of Manchester over 160 years ago, could become the first female British saint in over 40 years if approved by Pope Benedict XVI.

Theologians attached to the Congregation for the Causes of Sainthood have ruled that SISter Elizabeth lived out the virtues of faith, hope and charity to a heroic degree.

Historic: Sister Elizabeth could become Britain's first female saint in 40 years if approved by Pope Benedict XVI

Officials are finalising a position document which, if approved by Vatican theologians and scholars, will be presented to Benedict XVI, who will then declare Sister Elizabeth to be venerable.

The search will then start for two miracles for her beatification and her canonisation.

A candidate for sainthood must have at least two approved miracles attributed to them before they can be canonised.

The unexplained recoveries of two terminally-ill people after their families prayed to Sister Elizabeth are being investigated as possible miracles.

The last British women made saints by the Roman Catholic Church were all martyrs of the Reformation.

St Margaret Clitherow was crushed to death in 1586 in York for harbouring a priest in her home.

A sharp rock was put under her spine, and a door loaded with rocks placed on top. She took 15 minutes to die.

St Margaret Ward was hanged in 1588 after she helped a priest escape from prison.

St Anne Line was hanged at Tyburn, London, in 1601 for harbouring a Jesuit priest in her home.

Other Britons being put forward for sainthood as well as Sister Elizabeth include Venerable Mary Potter, the London-born founder of an order of nursing nuns in the 19th century, and Venerable Margaret Sinclair, a 20th century Scottish nun who died of tuberculosis after tending to the poor in Edinburgh's slums.

Victorian Cardinal John Henry Newman and aristocrat Father Ignatius Spencer are also being considered.

The latest development in the story of Sister Elizabeth's sainthood was revealed when exerpts from the positio were disclosed at a Mass in her honour in St Helens, Merseyside, last weekend.

Sister Elizabeth was renowned for her work with poor mill workers and refugees from the Irish potato famine, which saw her branded a 'revolutionary' in her own lifetime.

A 14-year inquiry into her life of 'heroic virtue' is sending its findings to the Vatican, and it could result in the Pope declaring her 'Saint Elizabeth of Manchester' in as little as five years.

A Roman Catholic convert, Sister Elizabeth opened nine schools in England's industrial North West.

She also set up an order of nuns  -  the Sisters of the Cross and Passion, or Passionist sisters  -  who helped women escape poverty by training them in the skills necessary to make a living on their own.

The order now has more than 600 nuns in more than ten countries including Argentina, Peru and Chile, where the sisters are known for their work with the poor.

The possible miracles attributed to Sister Elizabeth involve the unexplained recoveries of two people in Chile  -  a man suffering from cancer and a woman with a brain injury from a fractured skull.

They are said to have recovered after their families prayed to Sister Elizabeth.
