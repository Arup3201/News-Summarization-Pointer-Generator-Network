Tragic accident: Michael Leslie Jones, 59, choked to death on a piece of chewing gum near his home

A father choked to death on a piece of chewing gum as he made his way home from a night out with friends.

Michael Leslie Jones, 59, collapsed outside his home in what a coroner described as 'an awful, tragic accident that could have happened to anyone'.

Mr Jones was found lying in the road by his neighbours after an evening with friends at the Dolphin Pub in Mold on July 22.

A postmortem examination found a 2cm length of chewing gum obstructing the trachea.

Nicola Jones, deputy coroner for Wales North East and North Central, said: 'He had a drink but he wasn't drunk.

'He was steady on his feet and he hadn't complained of feeling unwell.'

But Mr Jones, a darts and dominoes player, later collapsed in the middle of the road by his home.

Next door neighbours Ellen Mulhearm, 
told of how she tried to save her neighbour as he lay in the street.

She said: 'My
boyfriend phoned me. He said "Les is outside on the floor". I checked for his pulse but there was nothing.'

An ambulance was called and neighbours rallied to save him by performing CPR. Paramedics shocked him three times before he arrived at Wrexham Maelor Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Alcohol in his blood was said to have been a moderate amount of 154mg per litre.

'So your father probably had less than four pints, not a great deal of alcohol,' Ms Jones told his children at his inquest in Mold on Monday.

Recording a verdict of misadventure, Ms Jones said: 'It's a very unusual case and if this serves to prevent it happening again, hopefully, people will be more aware of the dangers of chewing gum, especially for children.'

Mr Jones' 19-year-old daughter Trisha Jones said: 'We've been thinking for the last six months that he's had a heart attack. It's such a shock.'

Following the inquest, she described her father as loving and caring.

She said: 'He would always put people before himself. He was always fun and would make jokes out of everything.'

Mr Jones played dominoes and darts at the Cross Keys in Sychdyn.

Son John Jones, 20, said: 'He was a good man. He was always there for us.'
