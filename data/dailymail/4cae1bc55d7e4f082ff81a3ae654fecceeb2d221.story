Furious Manchester City will write to UEFA to complain on behalf of their supporters after the governing body revealed they would not take action against CSKA Moscow for allowing fans in to their behind closed doors Champions League game on Tuesday.

City were flabbergasted to see 300 rowdy Russian fans standing drinking beer — itself a breach of Champions League rules — in the main stand of the Khimki Arena in Moscow to watch their side snatch a 2-2 draw with a disputed late penalty.

Hearing stories of media passes and sponsor tickets being sold to CSKA fans and suspicious that security staff may also have let fans through the gates, City asked UEFA to look in to the issue.

On Wednesday though, UEFA declared themselves happy with the way things had been handled, prompting dismay and anger at City whose own travelling fans had been prevented by police from reaching an apartment overlooking the stadium from which they planned to watch the game.

A City source said last night: ‘We feel this is wrong and a complete injustice. It’s unfair that in a game that is supposed to be played in an empty stadium, the home club have 300 fans singing and cheering them on and we don’t have any. To us, that’s not a punishment.’

But UEFA chief of press Pedro Pinto said: ‘I think the club has already been penalised a lot, less than three per cent of the stadium capacity was in attendance. The club isn’t getting gate receipts and the players aren’t getting any meaningful support.

‘If we say it’s behind closed doors, then it’s supposed to be behind closed doors to the general public, but there are always tickets given to VIPs, UEFA staff and sponsors.

‘Following Tuesday’s match between CSKA Moscow and Manchester City, UEFA has reviewed the officials’ reports and found no breach of the conditions related to a match played behind closed doors that make part of the disciplinary decision.

‘Only people who were allowed to enter the stadium (club delegations, media, security staff, UEFA and guests of sponsorship partners) attended the match with no record of inappropriate behaviour.

‘However, UEFA is reviewing the “behind closed doors” policy to see if alternative solutions could be implemented in the future.’

‘Our sponsors and partners pay a lot of money to be associated with the competition and are entitled to receive a number of tickets. They shouldn’t have to pay the price for the behaviour of others.’

Pinto said UEFA’s reports from Moscow have shown there was no record of ‘any inappropriate behaviour in the stands’. He added: ‘We can’t stop a limited number of sponsors and corporate guests from supporting their own team. If they decide to show up with a scarf or flag we can’t stop that.

‘I can tell you, however, that there is an ongoing internal conversation on this issue in general and perhaps we’ll look to see if there are better solutions.’

Relations between City and CSKA are already at a low ebb following last season’s Champions League clash in Moscow that saw visiting midfielder Yaya Toure racially abused.

Officials from the Russian club subsequently showed their contempt for City by turning up at an official reception ahead of the return game at the Etihad Stadium dressed in jeans. City are now furious at the latest events in Moscow and captain Vincent Kompany took a dim view of the matter. He said: ‘This one really annoys me and maybe it’s on top of other things as well.

Manchester City need three good results to ensure they qualify from the group stage, and they can take heart from last season.

When they play CSKA Moscow next month, it will be exactly a year to the day since they beat them — the first of three straight victories that confirmed their qualification.

‘You say “No fans” then all of a sudden you turn up and basically the only team that hasn’t got fans is Man City. So who’s getting punished? Who is being done for racism? Man City or Moscow?

‘I don’t have a problem, they’ll say it’s sponsors and so on and they need to give certain allocations, but why are we getting punished?

‘And again, because you’ll have people in your papers writing columns saying “he should be looking at his own performance and stuff” — so, done, we’ve analysed it and we know we should have done better. But things like this are unacceptable to honest, there’s just no fairness in it.’

City were leading 2-0 at half-time but only took a point in the end after a controversial late penalty gave CSKA their first point in Group E.

‘It doesn’t have an effect on the players,’ said Kompany. ‘It’s just little things when you leave with a result like this.

‘Obviously you can’t deny there’s a bit of frustration, and I’m not looking for an excuse, but if you want to play it fair then, fair enough, you’ve got to let your sponsors have some tickets but why the hell do we not have any fans here? Why? What have our fans done wrong?

‘So it needs to be looked at, it needs to be changed, because our fans shouldn’t be punished.’
