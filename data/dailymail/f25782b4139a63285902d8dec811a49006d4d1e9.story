Billionaire Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos has discovered the F-1 rockets that launched Apollo 11's historic 1969 mission to the moon and now plans on digging them up from the bottom of the ocean.

Bezos says he's funded a successful mission to track the five F-1 engines and now plans to retrieve one or more so they can be publicly displayed.

The Seattle billionaire posted the announcement on his Bezos Expeditions website.

Groundbreaking: NASA's mighty Saturn V rocket was used to launch the historic Apollo 11

'I'm excited to report that, using state-of-the-art deep sea sonar, the team has found the Apollo 11 engines lying 14,000 feet below the surface, and we're making plans to attempt to raise one or more of them from the ocean floor,' Bezos wrote in the statement.

'We don't know yet what condition these engines might be in - they hit the ocean at high velocity and have been in salt water for more than 40 years,' he added. 'On the other hand, they're made of tough stuff, so we'll see.'

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos says his team has located the rocket engines that launched the Apollo II toward the moon

The F-1 engines on Apollo's Saturn V rocket dropped into the Atlantic Ocean minutes after they launched astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins on their historic voyage to the moon.

More than 40 years later, the Saturn V remains the largest and most powerful engine ever built, according to space.com.

Each of its five 12-foot F-1 engines is capable of generating about 32 million horsepower, burning 6,000 pounds of rocket fuel every second.

Bezos says on his website that as a five-year-old he watched in amazement as Apollo II launched into space, but a short time ago did he begin to wonder about the rockets.

'A year or so ago, I started to wonder, with the right team of undersea pros, could we find and potentially recover the F-1 engines that started mankind's mission to the moon?' Bezos wrote on his website.

Bezos acknowledges the engines belong to NASA and hopes that one day they will be displayed at the Smithsonian and perhaps at the Museum of Flight in his native Seattle.

His statement concludes: 'NASA is one of the few institutions I know that can inspire 5-year-olds.

'It sure inspired me, and with this endeavor, maybe we can inspire a few
more youth to invent and explore.'

The Apollo 11 is Bezos' second space-centred project.

Blue Origin, his spaceflight company partially funded by NASA, is developing a commercial spaceship capable of flying people to and from the Earth's orbit.

This mission is just the latest in a long line of exploration attempts launched by deep-pocketed adventurers.

Last week film director James Cameron dived to the furthest depths of the Pacific, while Virgin founder Richard Branson is hoping to start the world's first commercial 'space airline'.
