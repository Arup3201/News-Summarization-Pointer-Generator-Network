Immigrants trying to make their way into the UK from Calais are being offered 'package deals' costing up to £4,000 by human traffickers, a court has heard.

Desperate migrants were offered an £800 'budget' option, meaning they would be stowed inside a lorry destined for the UK, but were not guaranteed entry to this country.

 Paying £4,000 for a 'luxury' package meant would-be immigrants were stowed in a car boot, with the driver's consent, meaning the scheme had a much greater chance of success.

Traffickers in Calais offered migrants deals for getting to the UK, with budget transport organised for £800 and luxury options costing as much as £4,000 per head (pictured, migrants rush into a truck in Calais today)

For £800 people are bundled into the back of a lorry, often in a refrigerated compartment, but are not guaranteed entry to the UK. For £4,000 they are concealed in  a car boot, which has a higher chance of success

The shocking details were revealed during a trial of eight Egyptian men and one Tunisian who made hundreds of thousands of pounds from the schemes in the last two years alone.

Lawyer Stephane Duchateau told the court in Boulogne: 'There were two packages. The first was the standard one which involved being stowed in a lorry and cost up to £800 per head.

'Often this would involve breaking into lorries parked up in a part of Calais where they waited before boarding ferries. Sometimes these vehicles were refrigerated.

'The guaranteed package was usually in a car boot, with a driver who knew they were there. This had a much higher rate of success and costed up to £4,000.'

The men were jailed for between ten months and six years each for running the scheme.

The case appeared in court yesterday as Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, called the UK an 'El Dorado' for migrants because of generous state handouts.

Blaming the British government for the escalating crisis in the French port city, Ms Bouchart said those fleeing disasters in Africa and the Middle East were 'prepared to die' to reach Britain.

Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, she said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain.

There are around 2,500 African and Asian migrants currently in squalid camps around the French port city, with authorities saying the situation is the worst it has been for 20 years

Yesterday Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart laid the blame on the UK government, saying poor and desperate people view this country as an 'El Dorado' because of generous state handouts

‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives.

‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week. 

'People who have got through call and say,… "this is El Dorado and we’re staying here".’

Migrants are flocking to Calais in increasing numbers this year, with up to 2,000 people living in makeshift shelters as they wait to cross the English channel.

The impoverished conditions in the port city has lead Ms Bouchart to announce a new refuge for migrants, likened by many to the infamous Red Cross camp at Sangatte.

The failed camp acted as a base of operations for many trying to cross in the UK before it was closed in 2002. 

French authorities insist they have been left with few options after fighting between migrant groups lead to 70 people being injured this summer, while people have also been targeted by criminals.

Ms Bouchart is planning to build a refuge centre for those who arrive in Calais after infighting in the camps lead to 70 people being injured, but some fear it will simply attract more

Just last month a crew aboard a P&O ferry were forced to turn a firehose on a crowd of around 250 people as they tried to force their way on to the boat.

The lorry driver who filmed the chaotic attempt to board the ferry, bound for Dover, described Calais as a 'war zone' saying the situation was at its worst for 20 years.

He said many drivers are threatened at knifepoint and forced to let people hide in their vehicles. Anywhere within three hours drive of the port is considered a risk, he added. 

A row erupted this week after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that parts of the UK were being 'swamped' by migrants, only to retract the comment under pressure from Downing Street.

However his view was backed by former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett, who said politicians cannot avoid speaking about immigration, adding that Mr Fallon was right to ‘voice the concerns of ordinary voters’.

Both the Labour and Tory parties have been forced to take a tougher stance on the issue after UKIP saw its first MP, Douglas Carswell, elected in the Clacton by-election by a huge margin.

The anti-Europe party also saw a huge increase in its vote-share in Heywood and Middleton, where it came within 617 votes of taking the seat from Labour.
