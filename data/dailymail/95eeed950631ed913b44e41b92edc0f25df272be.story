New fear: Doug May lost over 300 pounds but is now struggling to eat a normal diet

A dieter who shed more than 300 pounds has now developed a fear of food.

Doug May, from Spartanburg, South Carolina is so concerned about putting the weight on that he lost three years ago that he now finds eating an ordeal.

'I've developed a fear of food,' he explained.

He sat on his front porch, next to a photo of a much heavier version of himself â€” a person he doesn't want to revisit.

'When I go out to eat, I have to force myself to eat,' he said.

Anna
Voss, a licensed professional counselor with Associates at Park Avenue 
in Greenville, said a fear of food is an eating disorder she sees often.

'It is something I commonly see,' she said

'After working so hard on one 
particular goal and then reaching it, it makes sense to become afraid of
the thing that created the problem for you in the first place. In this 
case, it's food.'

She compared the problem to a recovered alcoholic who becomes afraid of beer or bars.

You don't want to go back to the way you were, she said.

That's the fear May has.

'I don't want to put the weight back on. If I could get over that, I'd be OK.'

He
says he lost the weight by exercising at home and by changing his diet.

Today, he is 'basically a vegan,' eating mostly raw fruits and 
vegetables, and occasionally fish.

When May was heavier, he said his biggest problem was the all-you-can-eat buffet.

'I would pig out. I was out of control.'

Now, he realizes just how much he relied on food in his life.

'When
you try to take that out of it, it's hard to function,' he said.

'I 
just want to be able to enjoy a pizza with my (10-year-old) son.'

Bob
Brown, manager of the Spartanburg Regional Heart Wellness Center, 
encourages people who are wanting to lose weight to seek help from 
trained professionals.

'People sometimes have the best intentions of doing something like losing weight but go about it the wrong way,' he said.

'People
need to have that coach that oversees what they are doing and help 
educate them on the importance of things like nutrition and exercise.

'People
can tend to take things to the extreme and lose a lot of weight because
they are not versed in what foods they should or should not eat as well
as understanding the types of calories they are using.'

Voss suggest people struggling with an eating disorder, such as a fear of food, seek help from an expert.

'It is a really complex problem,' she said.
