The rat infestation in Vogue's new 1 World Trade Center office is getting worse.

Pests are now 'taking over' the newly-developed New York City premises and Anna Wintour no longer wants to step foot inside at all, reports claim.

This week, after rat droppings were allegedly found on an editor's computer keyboard, staff of all Conde Nast's titles were issued with a new rule: no eating at your desk.

New digs, big problem: While the US Vogue offices are moving to 1 World Trade Center in New York City, Anna Wintour may not be making the transition anytime soon

'A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,' a source told the New York Daily News. 

'They ate through his rug to fit under his door.'

After numerous failed extermination attempts, the city's health authority has now been notified. 

The setback means staff are unlikely to see the eponymous magazine editor in the building until well into the new year.

Day in the life: The publication was tongue in cheek about the moving process

According to Gawker, Wintour, 65, has allegedly informed her staffers that the vermin must be removed before she sets foot in their new home.  

The staff member told Gawker the most pressing dilemma facing them had to do with fashion: 'A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.'

The timing of the infestation comes after Vogue created an online campaign advertising their move to the new offices: 'Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we're coming for you.'

The Instagram feed for the Conde Nast owned publication showed rapper Will.i.am carrying boxes for them.
