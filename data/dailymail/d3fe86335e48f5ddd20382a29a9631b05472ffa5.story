A new student craze is set to be the new planking after a video of men pouring milk over their heads in public places has gone viral.

The group is made up of students and graduates, who are seen pouring four-pint containers of milk over themselves across Newcastle.

The video became an instant hit after it was uploaded on Monday night and has amassed nearly 30,000 views in less than a week.

Udderly amazing: 'Milking' involves pouring pints of milk over your head, preferably in public places, and it has taken YouTube by storm

The 2:45 video show no place is safe 
with ‘milking spots’ including outside pubs, in busy roundabouts, in a 
tree and in the middle of the road.

Tom Morris, 22, who was behind the 
video said: ‘We were just in our kitchen talking about doing it outside 
Starbucks in Jesmond and thought it would be really funny.

‘We did that, uploaded the video to Facebook and got a load of likes. So then we thought "why not just make a video"?’

Fellow 'milker' George Hoyland said: We didn't expect a reaction this large, the video was initially intended for our friends.

'The reactions have been very mixed, the puns people have posted have been great and caused a lot of laughter in our house!'

Student paper The Tab Newcastle 
reported that students in Edinburgh, Nottingham and Cirencester are all 
filming their own versions of Milking Newcastle as the trend spreads 
across the UK’s institutions for higher education.

Mr Hoyland said at least two videos have been made - one at prestigious Oxford University, and the group have been inundated with messages from others wanting to film their own 'milking' video.

Reactions to the hit video have been 
mixed with the comments section filled with puns and praise, whilst 
others say the students’ behaviour is immature and a waste of money.

‘All cities should be milked, we 
should start a revolution,’ YouTube user Rodrigo Rangel wrote, whilst SamSmurfet
 said: ‘Holy cow man! Dairy good video. Just semi-skimming youtube when I
 found this.’

Wastage: The group have been accused of wasting both time and milk - and in this case at least the milk has gone straight in the bin

Others were less impressed accusing 
‘milking’ of being immature and a waste of milk. Barbara Spicer 
commented: ‘The inventive, future Leaders of our country !’

Local Lib Dem councillor Gregg Stone tweeted: 'Not sure Jesmond students are helping their public image with £milking stunt.'

The Milking Newcastle group said that
 although they understand the concerns of Mr Stone, the intent was not 
to give students a bad name.

'We didn't think the video would stretch 
much further than our friends and would be disappointed if it created 
any animosity between students and residents,' Mr Hoyland said.

But despite the success of the video 
and the possibility of having created the next planking trend the boys 
are skeptical saying 'milking' is far less practical.

'The smell of sour milk is present all over our house, and the laundry pile is high!'
