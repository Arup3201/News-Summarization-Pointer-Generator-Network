An Ohio woman made fliers offering a case of beer and a pack of cigarettes as a reward for finding her lost dog - and it worked.

Twenty-three-year-old Abigail Miller of Dayton, Ohio offered the unusual reward after her two dogs Zoro and Anja who escaped through an open gate on Jan. 2.

She found Anja at a local animal shelter a few days later, but the other, a Husky named Zoro, remained missing.

Zoro was discovered by a good Samaritan after he's seen a photo of the dog in a poster offering a reward of beer and cigarettes and called the dog's owner Abigail Miller

'I was so worried about him' Miller told The Dayton Daily News.

One of Miller's frequent customers at Submarine House, the sandwich shop where she worked, saw a couple walking a dog he recognized from the 'missing' poster she'd placed in Kroger, Ohio.

The couple told the good Samaritan they'd found the Dog in Dayton's Oregon District and intended to keep it.

The Good Sumaritan called Miller and told her he had seen a dog that matched the photo in her flyer.

Her flier described Zoro as 'friendly, easy-going, a real smooth character.'

The Dayton Daily News reports that Miller came up the reward because she could afford it and figured it would attract attention.

She was right. The man who called and told Miller where to find her dog turned down the reward, but she says she's going to offer him some food from the sandwich shop where she works.

Miller found her dog Zoro at Montgomery County Animal Resource Center three years ago and the two have been in love ever since.

She calls the dog her spirit animal and said he had an 'undeniable calming presence.'
