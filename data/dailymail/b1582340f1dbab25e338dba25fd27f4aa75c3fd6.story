As the stomping ground of many Premiership footballers and their glamorous other halves, Cheshire is prime WAG territory.

Now local teenagers hoping to emulate the bronzed limbs, backcombed tresses and enhanced eyelashes of Coleen Rooney, Alex Gerrard and co can enrol in a new college course that promises to teach them how to achieve the 'sought-after WAG look'.

The course at West Cheshire College in Ellesmere Port will teach girls aged 16 and over how to master false eyelashes, fake tan and clip-on hair extensions.

The WAG makeover is similar to those sported by Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen on a trip to Aintree (pictured)

Students will also learn how to 
apply 'perfect' and 'fashionable' make-up, and accomplish 'that 
perfectly groomed look of big, bouncy hair'.

Programme
leader Karen Bennison said girls who admire pictures of WAGs in 
magazines and watch The Only Way Is Essex want to achieve the same 
'hyper-feminine' look as Cheshire resident Coleen Rooney or TOWIE star 
Chloe Sims.

'When we were 
looking for ideas for commercial courses the teaching staff all agreed 
that all the girls come in wanting to look like WAGs and have big hair, 
false eyelashes and full-on make-up,' she said.

'They
read glossy magazines, watch The Only Way Is Essex and Desperate 
Scousewives and want to achieve that same hyper-feminine look.

'So my colleagues and I agreed we should run a course to help them recreate it at home.'

The programme leader said the course 
aimed to teach girls to emulate the WAG look elegantly and was not about
'churning out clones'.

'Many
of the real-life WAGs are actually very sophisticated and that's the 
message we're trying to communicate here - that there's nothing wrong 
with being glamorous, but that it can be done with class and style.

'We
will show them how to apply false tan, fake eyelashes, clip-on hair 
extensions and make-up, and the techniques involved in achieving that 
celebrity look.

'But it's 
not about churning out clones or encouraging the girls to become a 
parody of themselves. We want them to feel confident, elegant and 
self-assured,' she said.

The college is located in a county with strong links to the WAG world.

Cheshire's Alderley Edge is notoriously popular with Premiership footballers and their pampered other halves, who can often be spotted looking suitably coiffed in the bars and restaurants that line the village's main street.

David and Victoria Beckham and their brood lived in a lavish converted barn in the village while David was playing for Manchester United.

Victoria Beckham was famously regarded as queen of the WAGs, but has ditched the mahogany tan and cleavage-baring outfits in recent years as she worked to build her high-end fashion empire.

The two-day 'How to Get the WAG Look' course will run at West Cheshire College's Ellesmere Port campus in October.
