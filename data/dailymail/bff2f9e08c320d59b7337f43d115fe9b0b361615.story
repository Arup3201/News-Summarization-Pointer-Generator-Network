Ireland have been served a fitness blow ahead of the autumn internationals and possibly the Six Nations after winger Andrew Trimble was ruled out with a toe injury.

Irish province Ulster said that the 30-year-old had suffered 'significant ligament damage' to his big toe during a recent PRO12 clash with Glasgow and is expected to miss 'a period of months'.

A statement from the province read: 'Andrew Trimble suffered significant ligament damage to his great toe playing in the PRO12 game against Glasgow Warriors.

Andrew Trimble, in action against England at Twickenham last season, will miss the autumn internationals 

'Ulster Rugby, in conjunction with the national medical staff, will seek second opinion on the management of the injury, however it's is expected that he will be out of rugby for a period of months.'

There was further bad news for Ireland after Trimble's club and country team-mate Luke Marshall was confirmed to have sustained medial ligament damage to his left knee during a clash against Yorkshire Carnegie.

The six-cap centre is expected to miss six weeks with the problem.

Luke Marshall, making a run against Australia in November 2013, is out for three weeks with a knee injury
