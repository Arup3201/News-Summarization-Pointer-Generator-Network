Channel 4 has caused outrage by commissioning a 'Shameless-style' comedy series based on the Irish potato famine - a tragedy in which more than a million people died.

The sitcom, called Hungry, was recently revealed by Dublin-based screenwriter Hugh Travers but has been met with strong opposition - with thousands signing a petition to prevent the show being aired.

Some say the show's comical stance is an insult to those who died and that the Irish potato famine is 'no laughing matter' and should only be shown in an historical context.

Irish potato famine: More than one million died when the potato crop was hit by disease in the mid 19th century

Writer Mr Travers told the Irish Times: 'They say comedy equals tragedy plus time.

'I don't want to do anything that denies the suffering that people went through, but Ireland has always been good at black humour.

'We're kind of thinking of it as Shameless in famine Ireland.'

Shameless was a Channel 4 hit comedy about a dysfunctional family living in a Manchester council estate riddled with alcohol and drug abuse.

Period: 1845-1849

Cause: Late blight - a disease that destroys both the leaves and the edible roots of the potato plant.

Late blight: Caused by water mold

Significance: It was the worst famine to occur in Europe in the 19th century.

Deaths: More than 1million people

Emigrated: Around two million people

By the early 1840s, almost one-half of the Irish population - but primarily the rural poor - had come to depend almost exclusively on the potato for their diet, and the rest of the population also consumed it in large quantities. 

A heavy reliance on just one or two high-yielding varieties of potato greatly reduced the genetic variety that ordinarily prevents the decimation of an entire crop by disease.

The Great Famine lasted from 1845 until 1849 when Ireland formed part of the British Empire.

One eight of the population died in the four-year period and two million people were forced to emigrate.

The TV project has been heavily criticised in Ireland before even being aired - with one Dublin councillor claiming the show was intended to 'embarrass and denigrate' one of the most tragic periods in Irish history.

Speaking to The Independent, David McGuinness added: 'Jewish people would never endorse making a comedy of the mass extermination of their ancestors at the hands of the Nazis. 

'The people of Somalia, Ethiopia or Sudan would never accept the plight of their people, through generational famine, being the source of humour in Britain. 

'I am not surprised that it is a British television outlet funding this venture.'

Anger: Dublin councillor David McGuinness has heavily criticised the show's premise

The councillor is calling on Irish broadcasters to reject the project. 

Hugh Travers, who is best-known for the award-winning Irish radio drama Lambo, said that the broadcasters had given him an 'open commission' - meaning he could write about anything he wanted.

So far more than 9,000 people have signed an online petition on change.org to prevent the show from being aired.

The petition reads: 'Famine or genocide is no laughing matter, approximately one million Irish people died and another two million were forced to emigrate because they were starving.

'Any programme on this issue would have to be of serious historical context... not a comedy.'

Twitter users have also weighed into the argument, with one, James Foran, calling the show 'unbelievably crass and insensitive'.

But not everyone is critical of the concept. Another Twitter user, Ryan Cullen, posted: 'No concept should be censored for art...wait until you see how's it's presented and what its intent is.'

He adds: 'Same people complaining about Channel 4 making a sitcom about famine are same complaining about 'The Interview' being pulled. Hypocrites.'

A Channel 4 spokesman said 'We have commissioned a script set in 19th century Ireland by Dublin-based writer Hugh Travers and Irish-based production company Deadpan Pictures - however this in the development process and is not currently planned to air.' 

Outrage: Many Twitter users have reacted angrily to the the proposal of a comedy based on the potato famine

So far more than 9,000 people have signed an online petition to prevent Hungry from being aired by Channel 4

Defence: There were a few who defended the idea of the programme on social media
