Steven Powell's home in Washington was sold to his voyeurism victims' parents. They have agreed to have it searched by cadaver dogs after Powell's daughter-in-law Susan went missing in 2009

Cadaver dogs are to search the home of Steven Powell, the father-in-law of Susan Cox Powell who vanished in 2009.

The Washington home of convicted 'Peeping Tom' Steven Powell was recently sold as part of restitution to the parents of the girls he took naked pictures of while they were in their bathroom next door.

Steven Powell was released from prison in March after serving two years for taking 
photographs of two girls, aged eight and ten in 2011.

During Powell's voyeurism trial, the girls' parents became friends with the parents of missing Susan, Chuck and Judy Cox.

The victims' parents agreed to allow a private search of the home with dogs in the next few weeks as it still has Steven Powell's belongings inside. 

Anne Bremner, the neighbors' lawyer, told MailOnline today: 'Chuck is never giving up hope.'

She added that the family do not know whether Mrs Cox Powell is alive or dead.

Law
 enforcement found the sordid photographs of the little girls' next door
 at Powell's home in 2012 while looking for evidence of his missing 
daughter-in-law. 

It appears that cadaver dogs were not used to search the home at the time because they were not covered by warrants obtained by West Valley Police and Pierce County Sheriff's Department to go into Powell's property, Ms Bremner said.

Calls to the Pierce County Sheriff and West Valley Police Department went unanswered today.

The attorney said on Wednesday: 'They didn't have the access we have now, they only had narrowly tailored warrants.'

The home also will be searched for other documents and records that might give clues as to the whereabouts of Mrs Cox Powell. 

Utah mother-of-two Susan Powell, 28, disappeared from her home in West Valley City in December 2009. She has never been found.

The Cox family claims that Steven Powell has information about his missing daughter-in-law. It was suspected that she was killed by her husband Josh Powell but he never faced charges in the case.

In 2012, he attempted to murder
 his sons, Charles, seven, and five-year-old Braden with a hatchet 
before setting his home alight, killing them and himself.

Last week, cadaver dogs were used in a privately-funded and volunteer-based search of a rural home close to Salem, Oregon for signs of Susan Cox Powell.

Her husband's aunt and uncle had been renting the property at the time of her disappearance in 2009. No signs of Susan's remains were found.

Powell is on probation for 30 months, required to wear a GPS locator and attend a sex-offender treatment program. He lives in Tacoma, according to the corrections facility.

The two girls victimized by Powell were awarded a $1.8million settlement as part of a civil suit.

Powell, 63, had argued against the sale of his home, saying that it would leave him and his two adult children without a home.

His early release date in May 2013 was rejected because, in part, he wanted to move back into the home. 

He was going to be released in November but that plan also fell apart because a landlord withdrew an offer to rent to him.

Steven Powell had a sexual obsession with Susan Powell that was thoroughly documented in journals seized by police.

In passages from 17 spiral notebooks written over more than ten years, he wrote of his sexual fantasies about Susan, how he believed she loved him too and hopes they would be together.

He wrote: 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem of her being married to my son. The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.'

He admitted 'looking at her naked body under the bathroom door (using a mirror)' though recognized this was a 'sick' thing to do.

But there is no hint that he or his son Josh had anything to do with her disappearance and he made mention of the possibility she ran off with another man - which is what Josh Powell told police.

Following her disappearance, authorities found blood in the family home and a hand-written note in which Susan Powell expressed fear about her husband hurting her.
