Leadership material? Ken Clarke signalled that he will back Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne as the potential next head of the Tories

Ken Clarke signalled that he will back George Osborne as the next Tory leader yesterday as he warned Boris Johnson to 'cool it' in his quest to replace David Cameron.

The Cabinet veteran said he was a 'big fan' of the Chancellor, who he said was 'playing a blinder' on the economy and warned his rivals Mr Osborne 'is bound to be a contender'.

Mr Clarke, who was Chancellor in John Major's government, said with the economy finally beginning to improve: 'George has the chance of coming out with a quite remarkable outcome.

'If he is the Chancellor who can steer the country out of the kind of mess he inherited and demonstrate to people that in his term of office we turned ourselves into a competitive modern economy enjoying normality in our economic circumstances, then that would be a complete triumph.'

In a shot across the Mayor's bows, Mr Clarke said Mr Johnson should not repeat his attention-grabbing performance at the last Conservative Party conference, where the mayor was greeted as a near rock star, held a victory rally for his mayoral re-election and embarked on a series of high profile media appearances.

Mr Clarke said: 'I gave some advice to Boris at last year's conference and my advice to him was that if he has an interest in the leadership, he should cool it," Mr Clarke said.

'There isn't going to be a vacancy for some years. David Cameron - with all the usual good luck and health - is plainly good for a very long time.

'The chances of David Cameron being Prime Minister after the next election are looking better than they have looked ever since we got in.'

Mr Johnson is widely favoured to take over from Mr Cameron if he loses the next election. By contrast, Tory MPs judge Mr Osborne's chances of succeeding Mr Cameron to be higher if the Prime Minister wins in 2015 since he is so closely associated with the Prime Minister.

Asked to assess the prospects of both Mr Osborne and Home Secretary Theresa May as future leaders, Mr Clarke said: 'I think George is for every possible reason concentrating on getting the economy through this lot, and he is doing damn well so far.

'If he does that, it is probably not doing too much damage to him to say he is bound to be a contender.'

But Mr Clarke had nothing to say about the possible claim on the top job of Mrs May, with whom he famously clashed over the case of an illegal immigrant who she said was spared removal from the country so he could stay with his cat.

Mr Clarke, who first entered 
Parliament in 1970, revealed that he would be deciding within two weeks 
whether he will stand as a candidate in the general election scheduled 
for 2015.

Speaking to a 
Westminster lunch, Mr Clarke indicated he was inclined to seek 
re-election, saying he remained interested in politics. But his wife has
been unwell and he signalled that he will make a decision after 
discussions with his family and supporters.

Mr Clarke also said that the government has accomplished far more as a coalition that it would have if the Tories had won with a small majority in 2010.

He also said while he initially thought a hung parliament would be a 'catastrophe', but has changed his mind.

'We have delivered more than we could have as a single party government,' he insisted. 'The present government can say we have put national interest before party interest. We have formed a coalition.

'If we hadn't done that, heaven help us. I do think a coalition can achieve more in a time of crisis than a single party government, though I'd like to move back to single party government as soon as possible.

'We've achieved more actually than we could conceivably have done as Conservative government with a tiny majority.

Some Tory backbenchers, frustrated at what they see as a Lib Dem block on Conservative policies have argued Mr Cameron should have not entered a coalition.

'What on Earth that was supposed to achieve I can't imagine,' Mr Clarke said. He said such a minority government would have 'faffed around for six months' while 'the world would have fallen around our ears'.
