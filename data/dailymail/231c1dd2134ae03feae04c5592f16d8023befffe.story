Michelle Obama and some of the biggest names in the NFL have led the congratulatory messages to Michael Sam, the Missouri football player who yesterday revealed he is gay.

The first lady personally expressed her admiration for the defensive lineman, who could become the first openly homosexual NFL player if he is selected for the league later this year.

'You're an inspiration to all of us,' she wrote. 'We couldn't be prouder of your courage both on and off the field.'

'Thank you for your kind words,' he responded. 'Humbled by your support.'

'#respect bro,' Richie Incognito of the Miami Dolphons sent Sam on Twitter. 'It takes guts to do what you did. I wish u nothing but the best.'

Jonathan Martin, who has had his fair share of struggles in recent months following the Dolphins' alleged bullying scandal, added: 'Hats off to you Michael Sam, that takes some guts #respect.'

Tom Crabtree of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers added: 'Good for Michael Sam. Takes courage for where he is in his career and where we are as a league. I applaud him.'

The comments section in his Facebook 
page was also inundated with people praising him as a 'positive role 
model for many' and thanking him for his 'brave and class act'.

Proud: Michelle Obama tweeted a message of support to Michael Sam, commending his decision

Response: Sam responded to the first lady on Twitter, thanking her for her support

Support: Members of the NFL, including Martin and Incognito of the Miami Dolphins, also supported him

But while they offered their support, hundreds of internet trolls bombarded Sam with a slew of personal attacks, while senior sport insiders warned his decision could ruin his professional career.

His announcement provoked a particularly strong backlash from religious sectors.

Within hours of his announcement 
yesterday, the Missouri defensive lineman was told he was 'hellbound' 
and he was part of a 'gay commercial being shoved down children's 
throats'.

One internet user
 called Anco Andrede said: 'If you accept homosexualitys (sic) you are 
hellbound for eternity with no chance of escape when the demons rip you 
apart and put you together again and torture you forever...'

The poster also demanded that he 'repent to God almighty or you will go there [Hell] forever.'

Another added that Sam should now be required to use other shower facilities in the locker room.

Proud: The image - as with many others - shows Sam has been wearing a rainbow-colored wrist band showing his allegiance to the gay community for numerous games. His teammates said they knew for 5 years

However, the vast majority of comments were positive and welcomed news that a top sportsman had the courage to come out.

But it was not just the darker realms of the internet which reacted angrily to Sam's revelations.

Several
 NFL insiders said the news that he was gay had done serious damage to 
his career prospects in the top-flight American football league and 
harmed his earning potential.

An NFL assistant coach, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Sports Illustrated it was 'not a smart move'.

Another insider added: 'I don't think football is ready for [an openly gay player] just yet.

'In the coming decade or two, it's going to be acceptable, but at this point in time it's still a man's-man game. To call somebody a [gay slur] is still so commonplace. It'd chemically imbalance an NFL locker room and meeting room.'

Coming out: Missouri All-American Michael Sam 
says he is gay, and the defensive end could become the first openly 
homosexual player in the NFL

Sin: One twitter user attacked the NFL prospect as someone who was being 'praised for sin'

'Hellbound': Other postings on YouTube said Michael Sam would be 'hellbound' and would be ripped apart by demons for being gay

Abuse: Some internet users took to the comments section under the YouTube video of Michael Sam coming out to launch a torrent of abuse

A number of senior figures thought 
the massive media attention now brought upon Sam, especially until the 
NFL draft on May 8, could harm his likelyhood of being picked by a top 
team for the next season.

An assistant coach told Sports Illustrated: 'There are guys in locker rooms that maturity-wise cannot handle it or deal with the thought of that.'

Missouri's All-American defensive lineman, 23, a 6-foot-2, 260-pound senior, released a series of coordinated interviews with The New York Times and ESPN's Outside the Lines program on Sunday.

'I'm Michael Sam. I'm a football player and I'm gay,' Sam, a defensive lineman, said in the video posted online. 'I just want to own my truth before anyone breaks a story about me.'

He went on to say that when he first spoke with his teammates about his sexuality last August, they rallied around him and supported him.

'We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage,' the NFL said in a statement.

Respect: In interviews with ESPN, The New York Times and Outsports that were published Sunday, Michael Sam said his teammates and coaches at Missouri have known since August.

'Michael is a football player. Any 
player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL. We look 
forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014.'

Representatives
 for Sam had been letting NFL teams aware that he was planning to come 
out before this month's NFL scouting combine.

No NFL player has ever announced publicly he's gay while his career is active. Former players including Esera Tuaolo have admitted they are gay after retiring.

In his series of interviews, Sam said, 'I am an openly, proud gay man.'

'It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.'

Other athletes to come out as gay have included Jason Collins, a veteran of 12 NBA seasons who revealed he was homosexual last year and Robbie Rogers, who plays Major League Soccer with the LA Galaxy.

Division III Willamette kicker Conner Mertens, a redshirt freshman, said last month he was bisexual.

Sportsman: Before coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football player

Michael Sam's sexuality had apparently been an open secret since August last year.

But a close teammate has told how the secret was kept much longer than that.

Missouri linebacker Donovan Bonner has been a teammate of Sam's for five years.

'We knew of his status for five years and not one team member, coach, or staff member said anything says a lot about our family atmosphere,' Bonner tweeted.

Sam said many people at the college all-star game for NFL prospects seemed to know that he was gay.

Before
 coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few 
close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football 
player.

'And I used that opportunity just to tell them that I was gay. And their reaction was like, `Michael Sam finally told us.'"

Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said in a statement Sunday night he was proud of Sam and how he represented the program.

'Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other,' Pinkel said.

'If Michael doesn't have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don't think there's any way he has the type of season he put together.'

Speaking to ESPN, Sam said that, 'I came to tell the world' about his sexual orientation.

He said that though he was nervous about doing it, it also felt good.

'It's a load off my chest,' he said.

'I told my teammates this past August that I came out to my teammates, and they took it great. They rallied around me, they supported me, and I couldn't have asked for better teammates.'
