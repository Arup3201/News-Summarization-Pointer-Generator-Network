A 92-year-old Iraqi farmer has married a woman 70 years his junior in a triple wedding ceremony with his two teenage grandsons.

Musali Mohammed al-Mujamaie married his 22-year-old bride Muna Mukhlif al-Juburi in a four-hour ceremony.

His grandsons, aged 16 and 17, also got married in the ceremony north of Baghdad on Thursday, according to AFP.

Newlyweds: Musali Mohammed al-Mujamaie said he made sure his wedding to 22-year-old wife Muna Mukhlif al-Jubur was on the same day as his two grandsons got married

Mr Mujamaie said the special day had 
been long-awaited as his grandsons' weddings had been postponed several 
times to coincide with his marriage ceremony.

He told AFP: 'I am so happy to get married with my 
grandsons,' Mr Mujamaie told AFP after the four-hour ceremony. 'I feel 
like a 20-year-old!'

Mr Mujamaie had raised 16 children in his home 
village of Gubban with his first wife, which lies just south of the 
central Iraqi city of Samarra.

The four-hour ceremony included 
musical and dance performances and celebratory gunfire.

Local tribal and
 religious leaders attended the triple celebration.
