An academic who stripped off in front of 200 students during a lecture has been let off with a warning.

Dr Ian Lamond, an events management lecturer at Leeds Metropolitan University, stripped down to his underpants in an apparent attempt to teach his first-year students how to pitch to clients.

The 51-year-old began the striptease by draping his jacket over the front row of desks where the students were sitting.

Dr Ian Lamond, 51, an events management lecturer at Leeds Metropolitan university, stripped off down to his underpants while teaching first-year students - but has been let off with a warning

The academic, who reportedly carried out the stunt in a bid to teach the students how to pitch to clients, draped his jacked over the front row of desks before removing the rest of his clothes - except for his underpants, glasses and socks

Photos then show the lecturer undoing his purple shirt and tie, before removing his trousers - until he was stood wearing just glasses, grey underpants and socks.

But Dr Lamond has been left off with a warning, following an investigation by Leeds Metropolitan University.

In a statement, the university said: 'An internal investigation has taken place. The University has clarified its expectations in lecture delivery and so the matter is now closed.'

Dr Lombard did not want to comment on the incident, but did not deny any of the claims.

He said: 'The university is a big institution. All communication must go through them. I am happy for my response to come through them.'

A source added: 'He is still in post. He has been given a warning but no sanctions.'

The bizarre incident took place while Dr 
Lamond was taking a lecturer in front of events management students 
about how to pitch to clients.

Stunned students went online soon after the incident, with one tweeting: 'I literally have no idea what is going on right now, why is my lecturer semi naked.. and now painting his face white..'

And another told her friend: 'Ian Lamond is stripping and shaving to try and convey a point but I really have no clue what is going on!'

A video of the incident was also posted online. It shows students chuckling in their seats as Dr Lamond marches around the front of the lecture hall, holding up his clothes.

No students complained directly about the lecturer's behaviour but the university launched an investigation after spotting the picture on Twitter.

Students in the lecture began tweeting their surprise as the incident unfolded

Another tweeted her friend say Dr Lamond was carrying out the performance to 'convey a point' - but that she had no idea what was going on

He was not suspended from the role during the investigation, but was not teaching during most of the interim period due to most students having finished for summer.

Dr Lamond completed his PhD in 
arts and culture policy at Sheffield Hallam University in 2012 and has 
since studied political activism while lecturing on the £9,000-a-year 
university course.

In a recent interview with a careers website, he boasted about his '(cough) "athletic physique"'.

Telling
 the website about his job, he said: 'What I am really enjoying is the 
combination of lecturing, particularly when I'm in-front of a cohort of 
200 plus events students in one of the larger lecture theatres, and 
research. It's that voracious curiosity and performer in me I guess.

An investigation was launched by Leeds Metropolitan University, pictured above, after the incident. A spokesman said the university had 'clarified its expectations in lecture delivery'

'Unless you are passionate you cannot enthuse your students, your colleagues and, importantly, yourself.'

Chris McGovern, Chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, criticised both the lecturer and the university.

He said: 'University lecturers should focus on teaching students rather than on stripping for them.

'This episode brings higher education into disrepute. It illustrates an arrogant contempt for students; many of whom make sacrifices to attend university and incur considerable debt.

'Equally worrying is that Leeds Metropolitan University has recently had its standards and quality confirmed by “The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA).

'This means it can market itself under the QAA Quality Mark to prospective student in the UK and abroad.'
