A group of Texas gun owners have attempted to recreate last week's attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices to see what would happen if one of the murdered journalists had a gun.

A dozen volunteers each took turns to participate in the simulation on a set designed to replicate the offices of the French magazine. The volunteers were armed with a handgun firing bullets made of paint.

Just one volunteer managed to survive after fleeing the building, two victims managed to take out a single gunman before being killed, while nine people died without injuring either of the attackers.

Armed: A dozen volunteers took it in turns to be attacked while armed with a handgun and sitting on a set resembling the offices of Paris magazine Charlie Hebdo

Breaking in: The 12 were each attacked by two men with automatic rifles. Only one survived after fleeing the building, two managed to kill one of the attackers, and nine died without injuring either of them

The exercise was organised in Plano by pro-gun campaign group   The Truth About Guns.

Volunteers sat in a crowded room mimicking the morning conference at Charlie Hebdo magazine where jihadi brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi  shot nine of the staff.

The volunteers in Plano were asked to sit around for a random length of time, before two men armed with automatic rifles comparable to the terrorists' weapons entered the building.

The pair, who had a similar level of training to that showed by the Kouachi brothers, were asked to make a small noise on their way in to give the volunteers a chance to prepare.

From that point the drama unfolded without a script, with all parties firing marker rounds filled with paint to reveal which people were hit.

Truth About Guns member Nick Leghorn told CBS Local: 'It’s interesting to see how people react under stress. It’s not what you’d expect people do.'

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people when they attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine a week ago today with Kalashnikov rifles

Nine of Charlie Hebdo's staff were murdered as they took part in morning conference (file image), a scenario the Texas simulation tried to replicate

Of the 12 people to participate, nine were killed in the office without managing to take out either of the attackers, just as the scenario played out with the unarmed journalists in Paris.

Only one female volunteer managed to survive the simulation by running from the set, leaving both of the attackers unharmed.

Two of the volunteers managed to take out a single gunman, as footage captured by CBSDWF.com shows.

However, none of the participants were able to stop the massacre by taking out both attackers.

The Kouachi brothers killed 12 people, including three police officers, when they attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris a week ago today.

Over the course of the next 48 hours the pair were pursued across northern France before being cornered and killed in a print works just north of Paris as they tried to return to the capital.

The publication was targeted for its history of publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, a gesture considered highly offensive to some Muslims. 

Today the first issue of the magazine to be produced since the attacks, featuring another cartoon of Mohammed on the front page, sold out in France within hours of going on sale.

Its usual print-run of 60,000 has been increased to almost five million in the wake of the attacks, which prompted solidarity marches around the world.
