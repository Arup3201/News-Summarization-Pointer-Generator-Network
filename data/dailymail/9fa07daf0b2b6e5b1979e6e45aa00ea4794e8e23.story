Very little has gone wrong for Steve Smith this summer, until, that is, the Australian captain's close encounter with the controversial 'Spidercam' which appears to have hindered his attempt to take a vital catch on day three of the fourth Test on Thursday.

In what was a frustrating morning session for the home side and the skipper in particular, a miscue from Indian batter Lokesh Rahul sent the ball skyward and Smith made ground to position himself underneath it for the catch.

But just as he appeared in control of the catch, out it spilled and Smith immediately pointed skyward, suggesting the camera, perched on wires above the ground, may have interfered.

Dropped. Steve Smith points to the sky after spilling the chance, appearing to claim he was unsighted by the 'Spidercam' which is strung on wires above the field of play to give an aerial view of the game

This is Spidercam. The unit strung above grounds for major sporting events by broadcasters like the Nine Network to give an aerial view of the field of play

It continued a session of near-misses for the home side, Smith clearly upset with team-mates when a gilt-edged opportunity to effect a run-out was also spurned, soon after his Indian counterpart Virat Kohli came to the crease.

But the drama with the camera and the catch was his alone.

The Nine Network sports team has responded, suggesting there was no impact between ball and camera ahead of Steve Smith dropping the chance

That wasn't supposed to happen. Everything Steve Smith has touched this summer has turned to gold, except this catch off India's Lokesh Rahul

The dropped catch is one of the few things to have gone amiss during the cricket season for Australia's new Test captain, who has led his side to a series win and leads the run-scoring too

The Nine  Network has responded with a tweet which said: 'Word from Spidercam is that the ball did not hit the camera or wires'.

It appears most likely Smith was either unsighted at some point or put off by the equipment as he positioned himself. 

And this has been confirmed by a joint statement on Thursday afternoon, by Cricket Australia and the Nine Network.

'We (CA & Nine) have spoken about the matter involving Spidercam and the dropped catch before lunch and it’s clear the ball did not hit the camera or its supporting wires,' the joint statement read.

'Captain Steve Smith was distracted by one of the wires in his eye line. Both CA and Nine will continue to work together on the use of Spidercam in the broadcast coverage and will take on board any player feedback as necessary.

'As it stands, if any player has a concern about the placement of Spidercam they can ask the umpires for it to be moved.'

Steve Smith is the leading run-getter this summer, boasting an average of well over 100 during the four Test series versus India

Rahul rubbed salt into the wound by going on to make a century before tea. Smith's rare bad day out in the middle continued when he dropped Kohli off the bowling of Mitchell Starc.

For Smith the home season of 2014-15 had been a red-letter summer, up until this point, joining the likes of Sir Donald Bradman and Jacques Kallis in scoring four straight centuries in consecutive Test matches.

He was elevated to the captaincy, Australia's 45th, when Michael Clarke succumbed to back and hamstring injuries after the first Test in Adelaide.
