They may look like mythical unicorns, but these brilliant white steeds are in fact beautiful stallions from Austria's world famous riding school.

Lipizzaner horses were bred for their outstanding qualities as carriage horses, but their incredible light-footed gait and acrobatic talent make them perfect for shows.

Vienna's finest steeds showed off their talents at a fundraising gala in the Spanish Riding School's splendid baroque hall, where glamorous guests watch the breathtaking visual spectacle, which has been nurtured over 430 years.

Sheer beauty: The Spanish Riding School's stallions are famous across the world for their astonishing talent

Classic elegance: Lipizzaner stallions are considered uniquely noble, spirited, willing and suited for the largely forgotten art of classical horsemanship

The School is not only the oldest riding academy in the world, it is also the only one where the High School of Classical Horsemanship still flourishes.

The Lipizzaner stallions are descendants of 16th-century horses from the Iberian Peninsula, who were considered especially noble, spirited, willing and suited for the art of classical horsemanship.

They are a cross between Spanish, Arabian and Berber horses and delight horse lovers from all over the world with their performances.

In 1729, Emperor Charles VI commissioned the architect Josef Emanuel Fischer von Erlach to build the magnificent Winter Riding School in the Hofburg Palace.

A portrait of the monarch graces the walls where the riders train their Lipizzaner stallions and show off their skills to an international audience during the public performances.

Breathtaking sight: Guests at the fundraising gala are able to enjoy some of the last remaining steeds trained in the High School of Classical Horsemanship

Splendid achievement: It takes around six years for a stallion to be ready to take part in the School and only very few master the jaw-dropping leaps - the elevated 'Schools above the Ground'

The Spanish Riding School is still wholly owned by the Austrian Federation and is charged with fulfilling certain duties for public benefit.

These include the continuation of the traditional breeding of Lipizzaners, the rearing and provision of prime stallions for the Spanish Riding School and the preservation of the High School of Classical Horsemanship.

At four years old, the stallions leave their birthplace in the Austrian town of Piber and travel to Vienna to be trained.

The strong, intelligent animals are begin with elementary field schooling, when they are ridden in a natural posture in straight lines.

The secondary field schooling, the following year, involves the horse being ridden in all gaits, turns and circles before the rider brings the horse to perfection.

Stallions learn the piaffe, the passage, pirouettes and to change legs in the canter.

It takes around six years for a stallion to be ready to take part in the School. Only very few, particularly talented and sensitive stallions master the jaw-dropping leaps - the elevated 'Schools above the Ground'.
