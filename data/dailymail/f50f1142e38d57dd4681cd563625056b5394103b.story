People could someday be living the high life in this futuristic 'super city' towering 2,230ft (680 metres) into the clouds.

The Cloud Citizen project, a 1.7 million square foot metropolis, dwarfs all but one skyscraper in the world - the 2,717ft (828 metres) Burj Khalifa.

It was designed as part of a competition to create a new iconic business district in Shenzhen Bay, China - and the towering design won first prize.

The high-life: People in Shenzhen Bay, China could someday be living the high life in this futuristic urban community towering 2230ft (680 metres) into the clouds. The concept building was designed as part of a competition to create a new iconic business district, scooping first prize

The ultra-modern building would use solar and wind power, as well as harvest rainwater, making it efficient for the community.

Hong Kong-based Urban Future Organisation and CR-design in Shenzhen collaborated with Chalmers Technical University in Sweden on the concept.

The idea behind the competition was to create an iconic new business district, similar to London’s Canary Wharf or Midtown Manhattan in New York.

However, unlike those business districts, Cloud Citizen is made up of one, huge integrated building.

It took a dedicated team of designers around 12 weeks of work to create the plans.

The design aims to give back to the environment through rainwater harvesting, solar and wind power, and pollutant filters.

A number of smaller areas within the large structure have been set aside for IT-industry, commercial, leisure, and cultural areas.

Each one of these spaces is also connected to a large park, and aims to encourage a sustainable lifestyles.

Jonas Lundberg, international design director for the Urban Future Organisation, said their vision was less about grandeur and more focused on giving back to the environment.

'We were interested in the old Chinese low-rise courtyard blocks, called Hutongs, and wanted to see if we could use the informal village arrangements of these in a 3D setting for increased social interaction,' he said.

'Our partner, CR-Design, is based in Shenzhen and that's why we decided to work on this project together.

'Shenzhen is changing from manufacturing to service industries, which has been tremendously fast-paced already.

'The point was to create a project with the capacity to give more to the environment than it takes.

'We not only tried to create a meaningful public space in the sky, but we also worked on water harvesting, sky gardens and micro generation, for example.'

While the designs are still a concept, they could someday be built in Shenzhen, a major city in the south of Southern China's Guangdong Province, situated immediately north of Hong Kong (pictured)

A London-based architect has been making waves in the design industry with her vision of a stunning home powered by hydroelectricity.

Margot Krasojevic's concept, Hydroelectric Tidal House, aims to harness the consistent and powerful movement of waves to generate energy.

Ms Krasojevic is an avid supporter of renewable energy - previously designing an electric coral reef station and a hydroelectric prison.

She explained that the construction will be focused around two shells - one inner and one outer.

Made of concrete, the outer shell is designed to keep the house stable and will use solar cells to generate energy for the living section.

 The inner section, which will be made of aluminium, will move in cohesion with the tide. The section will float within the external structure as the tide rushes through it.

As tides are more predictable than solar energy, Ms Krasojevic has included a two-part turbine, which, reacting with waves, will compress air to create an electrical current - similar to a wind turbine.

The second part of the turbine uses magnets that move along a copper wire, also generating electrical energy.
