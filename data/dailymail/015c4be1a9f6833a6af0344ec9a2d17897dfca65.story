When it comes to the political arena, he's never been one to pull any punches.

And Boris Johnson seemed determined to keep that same philosophy today when he came face-to-face with a new set of competitors.

The London Mayor took to the boxing ring in North Woolwich, London, where he sparred with young boxers at the Fight For Peace Academy.

Donning his usual shirt and tie, Mr Johnson's gloves were heard snapping against the pads as he entertained the waiting crowd with a series of theatrical ducks and dives.

Ready: London Mayor Boris Johnson pulled on the gloves as he visited an academy in North Woolwich, London

Poised: Mr Johnson took to the ring while donning his usual shirt and tie and a pair of bright red boxing gloves 

Serious: Mr Johnson's gloves were heard snapping against the pads as he entertained the waiting crowd at the Fight For Peace academy 

He was seen grimacing and struggling as he landed his best right-handed punches onto the pads 

Members cheered and applauded as Mr Johnson stared into the eyes of his various sparring partners

Despite not being naturally light on his feet, members cheered and applauded as Mr Johnson pulled on his most serious facial expressions and got to work with his bright red gloves. 

He then stared into the eyes of his sparring partner, before delivering a series of right-handed punches.

Ebenezer Ayerh, youth engagement officer, said the Mayor was on site for around an hour, during which he met academy members.

He also spoke on the phone with founder Luke Dowdney, who is visiting the sister club in Brazil, before observing a training session.

Afterwards, Mr Johnson tweeted: 'Great visit to @fightforpeace in Newham to see great work they are doing with young people in local community.'  

In 2010, Mr Johnson pledged money to Fight For Peace, as part of a collective £2.4m funding for 18 projects across the capital.

The aim of the money was to help increase participation in sport among Londoners.

Fight For Peace uses boxing and martial arts to work with young people in the borough at risk of crime and violence.

It's a knockout: Mr Johnson got a sweat on as he delivered his blows, much to the delight of the academy members

The London Mayor has previously praised boxing clubs for being 'overflowing with effort, discipline, respect and comradeship'

Since its conception in 2007, 7,000 people have accessed the academy, from all over London.  

In the past, Mr Johnson has made no secret of his support for boxing clubs in the capital, saying: 'London’s network of fine amateur boxing clubs embody all that is wonderful about sport.

'They are overflowing with effort, discipline, respect and comradeship which are great skills for young people.'

It's not the first time Mr Johnson has shown his competitive side in recent weeks. 

Earlier this month, Mr Johnson joined in a children's football match outside City Hall to promote a new health report aiming to get more children involve in sport.

But Mr Johnson ended up issuing a public apology for his behaviour, after sending a nine-year-old stumbling to the floor during the friendly kick-about. 

The scene sparked shouts of 'Referee!' from the side-lines.
