A volunteer of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office posse member was left clinging to life after he was shot in the chest while aiding a police officer during an armed robbery.

The Arizona law enforcement agency said Saturday that 63-year-old Phillip Grigg was critically wounded this week after coming to the rescue of a Phoenix officer, who also was shot.

Deputies said Grigg, a married father of two and grandfather of three, has undergone multiple surgeries and remains in critical condition.

The sheriff’s department said Mr Grigg has been a posse volunteer for three years, working at the search and rescue and aviation units.

The Arizona Republic reported that Grigg's wife of 25 years, Elizabeth, said at a news conference she was proud of her husband.

‘It was the wrong spot, the wrong time, but the right time. The good Lord sent him to do a job and that's my Phil,’ she told 3TV. 

A robbery of $18,000 from two strip club employees Tuesday in east Phoenix led to a police chase and the wounding of veteran Phoenix Officer Scott Sefranka and Grigg.

Two suspects, 26-year-old Roger Allen Sharp and 36-year-old David Lee Murray, have been charged in the robbery and shooting, and a third man was arrested Friday, ABC15 reported.

In a press conference Saturday, Elizabeth Grigg told reporters that on December 31, her husband, a tractor-trailer driver, was sick at home.

Shocking news: Elizabeth Grigg, the volunteer's wife, told reporters she initially thought her husband had been in a car wreck

In the afternoon, Grigg was on his way to a supermarket to pick something up when he was struck at 56th Street and Thomas Road by a red car driven by Roger Sharp.

According to police, the 26-year-old Phoenix man was fleeing from the scene of a stickup robbery outside an IHOP when he slammed into Grigg's white pickup truck.

Sharp and Murray were being pursued by Officer Scott Sefranka, who responded to the scene.

Following the collision, the cop attempted to apprehend Sharp, but the suspect allegedly put up a fight. That is when police say Grigg jumped into action and came to Sefranka's aid.

However, the 26-year-old alleged robber was able to get a hold of Sefranka's service weapon and shot him and Grigg.

Sharp and his alleged accomplice attempted to flee but were arrested by responding a few blocks away.

A third suspect, Jason Beau Keep, 35, was arrested Friday and charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Police are still searching for a fourth suspect.

Both victims were rushed to the Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Medical Center, where they are being treated for their life-threatening injuries.

Phoenix Police Chief Daniel Garcia said Sefranka, a seven-year veteran on the force, is now breathing on his own but remains in a medically induced coma.

Grigg's wife said that her husband suffered significant internal damage and has undergone four surgeries since Tuesday.

‘He knows we are there. He squeezed my hand,’ she said, according to AZCentral.

Mrs Grigg recalled that when she first got a call that her husband was in the hospital, she thought he had been in a car accident.

‘I thought I was coming up to pick him
 up for a couple broken bones,’ she told reporters. ‘I had no idea what 
had happened that day.’

According to Mrs Grigg, her husband, a Vietnam War, has always been the kind of person who would stop and offer his help to a stranger in distress.

In a press release, Sheriff Joe Arpaio described the 63-year-old posse volunteer as a kind and caring man who loves animals.
