Police and protesters clashed in crisis-hit Ferguson after police chief Tom Jackson issued an apology to the family of black teenager Michael Brown who was shot by one of his officers. 

Jackson stood outside the police station and marched briefly with protesters before scuffles broke out in the St Louis suburb. 

One man was arrested following the brief disturbance according to reports in the St Louis Post-Dispatch.

Jackson told protesters: 'All those things that are causing mistrust are being evaluated and we are going to be making changes.'

Three other protesters were arrested during a later confrontation.  

Earlier Thursday, Jackson released a video apology to Brown's family and the community in which he acknowledged that Brown's body should have been removed from the street much sooner after he was killed. Brown's body remained on Canfield Drive, a residential street, for more than four hours while police collected evidence.

He said: 'It was just too long and I'm truly sorry for that. Please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the Brown family, to the African-American community or the people of Canfield (Drive). They were simply trying to do their jobs.

Addressing the Brown family directly, Jackson said: 'I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son.'

Brown's parents declined comment when told about Jackson's video during a news conference with civil rights leaders at the National Press Club. Their attorney later said they hadn't heard about the video but would review it.

Speaking out: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released this video apology on Thursday morning to say sorry to the family of slain teen Michael Brown for leaving his body in the street for so long

Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot on August  9 during a confrontation with Officer Darren Wilson. The shooting sparked numerous protests and racial unrest in the predominantly black community. Some residents and civil rights activists have said responding police officers were overly aggressive, noting their use of tear gas and military-style vehicles and gear.

'It is clear that we have much work to do,' Jackson said in the video.

The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the Ferguson Police Department for possible civil rights violations.   

A total of four people were arrested during last night's civil rights protest in Ferguson, Missouri 

Tensions in the St Louis suburb have been extremely high since Michael Brown was shot on August 9 

Protesters are especially angry that police left Mr Brown's body on the street while they gathered evidence 

'I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street. The time that it took involved very important work on the part of investigators, who were trying to collect evidence and gain a true picture of what happened that day, but it was just too long, and I am truly sorry for that.' 

It took police officers more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson on August 9. Brown, who was black, was not armed.

'Please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the Brown family, to the African-American community or the people of Canfield,' Jackson went on. 'They were simply trying to do their jobs.'

He also said sorry for the police response to protesters. Crowds began marching in the days after the shooting and escalated into violence and looting in some places.

The police response was slammed as inept and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ultimately put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of policing the protests.

'I do want to say to any peaceful protester who did not feel that I did enough to protect their constitutional right to protest, I am sorry for that,' Jackson said. 

'The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible, and I'm sorry.'

He also acknowledged how the situation blew up overnight and drew Ferguson into a discussion about race relations and the attitude of the police across the U.S. 

'Overnight I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation,' he said. 'As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution.

'For any mistakes I've made, I take full responsibility.'

The Justice Department is investigating whether the Ferguson police used excessive force, whether constitutional rights of some residents are violated by traffic stops, searches and arrests, and if police engage in discriminatory practices.

Ongoing violence: On Tuesday, a memorial for Michael Brown was burned down in Ferguson

Jackson was not at the meeting but has said he welcomes the investigation.

Even now, unrest continues in the area.

Fire destroyed a memorial to Brown at the site of the shooting early on Tuesday, generating new anger among some residents. Police say the cause of the fire is under investigation.

The fire may have been the spark for a violent protest Tuesday night. One store was damaged by looting, another was set on fire, and police were attacked with rocks and bottles. Two officers suffered injuries when they were hit by rocks.

A state grand jury is weighing if Wilson will face criminal charges, but a decision isn't expected until mid-October at the earliest.
