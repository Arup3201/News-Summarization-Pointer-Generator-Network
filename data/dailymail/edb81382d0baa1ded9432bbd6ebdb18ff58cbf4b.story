The Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is a party divided again today with Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, refusing to attend all meetings, after an alleged homophobic slur against his son by Deputy Chief Minister Dave Tollner.

Parliamentary colleagues have confirmed Mr Higgins' stance. He's informed party officials that he does not want to present at future meetings where Mr Tollner be in attendance.

According to the NT News, the territory's Deputy Chief Minister is accused of calling Joshua Higgins a 'pillow biter' and 'shirt lifter'.

NT Minister Dave Tollner has resigned as Deputy Chief and moved to the backbench after calling the son of a Country Liberal Party colleague a 'pillow biter' and a 'shirt lifter'

Mr Higgins is a staff member working for Community Services Minister, Bess Price.

It's been reported that the verbal attack occurred in the wake of a draft speech having been presented to cabinet ministers.

The Chief Minister Adam Giles has bought into the latest scandal to beset his party, calling his deputy's comments 'inappropriate and not acceptable'.

Reports in the NT News suggest Health Minister Robyn Lambley was also dragged into the controversy, admonishing Mr Tollner in front of cabinet colleagues and demanding he apologise.

Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, has since announced he has accepted Mr Tollner's apology after originally threatening to boycott all Country Liberal Party meetings

'Mr Tollner has apologised for his comments,' Mr Giles added.

'The Treasurer has told me that he did not intend to cause harm or offence with these comments and I know the individual concerned has accepted Mr Tollner’s apology.'

Mr Giles believes the matter has been dealt with despite Mr Higgins' contention that he will not attend party room meetings should Dave Tollner be present.

'The person in question is a valued staff member and has met with me and expressed a desire to move on and that’s what we now intend to do,' Mr Giles said.

Senior party officials disagree though, hinting at disciplinary action being the most appropriate action. One says that the CLP 'team is not cohesive'.

The Chief Minister has not been immune from controversy either. Adam Giles led a party room challenge in March last year, toppling Terry Mills from the top job.

This would ultimately sparked another internal revolt. Three of the party's indigenous members  quit the party, pushing Mr Giles perilously close to leading a minority government. Ironically, it's only the  victory (despite a massive swing against them) in Mr Mills' former seat of Blain which has the CLP clinging to a one-seat majority in parliament.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Tollner for comment.
