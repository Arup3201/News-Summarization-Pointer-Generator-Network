Apple could be deliberately making your iPhone slower when a new model comes out, an influential tech columnist has claimed.

Catherine Rampell, who writes in the New York Times, said that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product.

She added her iPhone 4 became a lot slower when she downloaded iOS 7 - and that the only solution seemed to be to buy the iPhone 5.

Catherine Rampell, who writes in the New York Times, said Apple could be engineering its operating systems so that it only works properly with the newest version of the product, such as the iPhone 5S pictured

Rampell accused Apple of having run out of ideas so was trying to ‘brainwash’ its customers into buying the new iPhone 5S and 5C because they look nice.

Rampell’s claims are likely fuel conspiracy theorists who have long held that Apple engages in ‘planned obsolescence’, a term which has been around since the Great Depression in the 1930s.

The theory states that manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing consumers to buy a new one.

In the piece, called ‘Cracking the Apple trap’, Rampell writes that her interest was piqued when she upgraded to iOS 7.

The piece generated such a debate it was featured on a number of tech blogs and she was invited on major US TV network CNN to discuss it.

Rampell writes: ‘At first, I thought it was my imagination. Around the time the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, in September, I noticed that my sad old iPhone 4 was becoming a lot more sluggish.

‘The battery was starting to run down much faster, too. But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products.

‘When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow.

‘Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software.

‘So I could pay Apple $79 to replace the battery, or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an iPhone 5C. It seemed like Apple was sending me a not-so-subtle message to upgrade.’

Apple has faced allegations that it is guilty of planned obsolescence before.

When it started using more tamper-resistant screws experts said it was to stop users getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a problem.

Last year Apple was sued in Brazil by the Brazilian Institute of Politics and Law Software over the launch of the iPad Air.

The organisation claimed that because it had the new retina screen it made the iPad 3 redundant and that Apple was changing its devices too quickly.

In her column Rampell said: ‘When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry.

‘If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base.

‘But it seems Apple may have already figured this out too. Just check out the wait times for the iPhone 5S in that shiny new gold colour’. MailOnline has approached Apple for comment.

Commenting on the news, Brian Barrett from Gizmodo dismissed Rampell's claims: 'The iPhone 4, was released to the general public in 2010. [Since then] that phone has been through countless firmware updates, taken untold photos, been charged improperly, been dropped. It has, in short, been used.

'I don't doubt that Rampell is coming from a place of genuine frustration. But it's misinformed, and worse, misleading. Technology becomes obsolete. Batteries don't last forever. That's not exclusively Apple's problem, nor is it exclusively Apple's fault.'

Apple's iOS 7 was the fastest software upgrade in history, according to official figures, with 200 million devices running the operating system within five days, only 9 million of these were new iPhones.
