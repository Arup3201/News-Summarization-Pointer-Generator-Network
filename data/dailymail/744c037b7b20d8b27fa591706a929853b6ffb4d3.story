Burnley

Dean Marney is set to return from a hamstring problem for the Clarets' trip to Arsenal on Saturday. 

Marney has trained all week and could go straight back into the side but the game again comes too soon for Steven Reid, who has only just returned to training after a groin problem. 

Midfielder Matt Taylor's Achilles operation was a success but no date has yet been set for a possible return while striker Sam Vokes is still working his way back from a serious knee injury.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Lafferty, Ward, Duff, Shackell, Mee, Wallace, Kightly, Cisak, Sordell, Marney, Jutkiewicz, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Long, Barnes, Arfield, Ings, Chalobah, Jone

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Arsenal have been behind at some point in each of their four Premier League home games this season.

Burnley were the first lower league team ever to beat an Arsene Wenger Arsenal team in a cup competition when they won 2-0 in the 2008-09 League Cup.

Arsenal have won their last three home matches in all competitions against the Clarets.

Burnley have conceded 12 goals in their last four games in the  Premier League – this after previously keeping three clean sheets in a row.

Arsene Wenger’s side are unbeaten in their last 22 home Premier League matches, winning 14 and drawing eight.

Theo Walcott could make his first appearance of the season against Burnley, having scored against the Clarets when the teams last met in the Premier League  in a 3-1 home win for Arsenal in March 2010

However, they have kept just two clean sheets in their last 10 PL games at the Emirates.

Theo Walcott is the only player to score in the two 2009/10 Premier League meetings between these sides to still be at either club.

Just 16.5 per cent of Burnley’s attempts on goal this season have been fashioned from set piece situations, a Premier League low.

Burnley are the 12th side to fail to win any of their opening nine Premier League matches of a single season - seven of the previous 11 sides were relegated.

Just nine teams have previously failed to win any of their opening 10 games in a Premier League season – the last occasions being Reading and QPR in 2012-13.

Jason Shackell is the first Premier League player to make over 100 clearances this season (101).
