A teenage mother has been stabbed to death in Texas by her child's father while she clutched their baby daughter in her arms, police and family members say.

Megan Marie Hernandez, 17, was attacked Tuesday afternoon outside her high school in San Antonio, Texas, as she waited for the bus.

Witnesses told police that Edurado Reyes, 17, started arguing Megan as she held their one-year-old child. He suddenly pulled out a knife and stabbed Hernandez multiple times in the chest and abdomen, according to authorities.

The San Antonio Express-News reports that a 15-year-old bystander jumped in to help Hernandez, but Reyes turned the blade on him and cut the teen repeatedly.

Hernandez was just feet from her school, Por Vida Academy Charter High School, and numerous witnesses watched the stabbing in horror.

Miraculously, Hernandez was able to shield her child from the savage attack and the baby was not injured.
