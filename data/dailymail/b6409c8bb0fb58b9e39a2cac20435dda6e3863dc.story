Hotel guests may get a shock next time they reach for a copy of the Gideon Bible from their bedside cabinet.

The Damson Dene hotel near Windermere, Cumbria, has decided to replace the book - which is traditionally stocked by British hotels - with copies of the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey.

The decision has caused outrage - although many female guests, and some men, are sure to be pleasantly surprised when they discover the best-selling novel in their rooms.

Hotel manager Wayne Bartholomew has caused outrage by replacing the Gideon Bible with copies of the erotic novel, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' in guests' bedside cabinets.

Located in the tranquil Lyth Valley, the upmarket hotel boasts 40 bedrooms, including ten with four poster beds and an en-suite Jacuzzi bath.

Guests can enjoy its landscaped gardens, and make use of its pool, spa pool, sauna, steam room and gym.

Prices range from £79 per person for a standard room to £99 per person for the rooms with four poster beds.

Hotel manager, Wayne Bartholomew 
said he hit on the idea to swap the books in response to online chatter from his more than
3,200 Facebook contacts.

He said: 'Fifty Shades of Grey is all 
that people are talking about at the moment, but I know that some are 
too shy to buy it for themselves.

'I thought it would be a special treat for our guests to find it in their bedside cabinet and that includes the men.

Guests of the Damson Dene Hotel near Windermere in Cumbria will find copies of the 'Mummy Porn' novel Fifty Shades of Grey next to their beds rather than the traditional Gideon Bible.

'They are as desperate to get their hands on a copy as are the women.'

Mr Bartholomew said the Gideon Bible was also full of 'sex and violence,' but said it was more formally written than EL James' steamy novel.

'James’ book is easier to read,' he said.

EL James has sold millions of copies of her erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey worldwide.

The three books of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy are the first, second and third best-selling print books at 
Amazon.co.uk and their combined sales have also made Mrs James the 
best-selling print author of the year so far.

Sales of the books have overtaken the Harry Potter books and the Da Vinci Code.

The bestselling Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy.

Despite the trilogy only being published in March this year, the racy international best-sellers - dubbed 'mummy porn' - have sold over one million copies from Amazon for use on Kindle, while Mrs James has become the bestselling author of the year on the site as a whole.
