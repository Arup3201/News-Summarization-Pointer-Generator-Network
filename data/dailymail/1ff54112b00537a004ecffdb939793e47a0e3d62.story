New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen on Tuesday became the latest Democrat to find herself in the awkward position of having to distance herself from President Barack Obama in order to pacify her electorate.

At a debate last night against her Republican opponent, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Shaheen was asked a 'yes or no' question about whether she approves of the job that President Barack Obama is doing.

Shaheen completely ignored the 'yes or no' premise of the question, and replied, 'In some ways I approve, and some things I don't approve.' Her dodge drew roars of laughter from the audience.

'Like most questions that we deal with as policy makers, there aren't simple answers, yes or no,' she quickly added.

New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen waves to supporters as she arrives for a live televised debate on Tuesday in Concord, New Hampshire. On Tuesday Shaheen  became the latest Democrat to find herself in the awkward position of having to distance herself from President Barack Obama in order to pacify her electorate

Democratic candidates' level of coziness with the president and his polices has become a critical issue in the midterm elections. Republicans have sought to capitalize on the president's unpopularity by tying their opponents to him in every way possible, and Democrats have tried to avoid Obama without denouncing him.

Brown has made Shaheen's history of supporting the president's agenda a key part of his offensive in the New Hampshire Senate race. His favorite line of attack against his former colleague is that she's voted with the president 99 percent of the time.

Early in Tuesday night's debate Brown trotted out the allegation and claimed 'it means she was the deciding vote for Obamacare.'

'She’s also voted to put in place policies where we have more and more gridlock by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time,' Brown added.

Later in the debate Shaheen was given the opportunity to respond, and she didn't deny Brown's claim about support for Obama's agenda. Instead, she pivoted to her record of creating jobs in New Hampshire.

A fact-checking website in New Hampshire said last year that it's 'mostly false' that Shaheen was the 'deciding' vote in favor of the president's health law, but it ruled yesterday that Scott's accusation that she votes with the president 99 percent of the time is 'mostly true.'

The main discrepancy in the claim seems to be that earlier in her career she only voted with Obama 98 percent of the time, according to Politifact's analysis, though she's voted for his policy proposals 99 percent of the time since.

The attack on Shaheen is particularly poignant given that 55 percent of Granite Staters are unhappy with President Obama's leadership, according to an Oct. 10 poll.

Shaheen's opponent, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, accused her of voting with the president 99 percent of the time. Shaheen neither confirmed nor denied the claim. Instead she began talking about her record of creating jobs

President Obama made it even more difficult for Democrats in close races -  like Shaheen - earlier this month when he claimed that while his name isn't on the ballot, his polices are - 'every single one of them.' 

On Monday he put vulnerable Democrats back in the hot seat when he claimed that even the members of his party running away from him 'vote with me.'

'They have supported my agenda in Congress,' he said.

The White House tried to downplay the significance of Obama's comments on Tuesday, saying that it's individual candidates whose names are on the ballot at the end of the day.

Furthermore, the president's remarks were meant to help excite his core fans to vote this fall, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

'The fact of the matter is... Democrats who are running in red states, blue states and in so-called purple states, are going to need the strong support of those voters who supported the president in his reelection campaign,' Earnest argued.

Polls show Shaheen leading Brown by three points on average. Taking the surveys' margins of error into account, the race could be tied, putting Scott in striking distance of a political comeback.

After losing his Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren in the 2012 general election, Brown relocated to Massachusetts' neighbor state New Hampshire in order to challenge Shaheen, who is up for reelection this November.

Democrats have accused Brown of being a carpetbagger whose only interest is getting elected to public office. 

National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Brad Dayspring said on Tuesday that Brown's ability to keep the race between he and Shaheen close is telling. 

'Since August, Democrats have thrown the kitchen sink and everything under it at Scott Brown, and he is now in a statistical dead heat against Jeanne Shaheen,' Dayspring said. 

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee laughed off the possibility of a Brown win on Tuesday, however, and characterized him as a has-been.

'Scott Brown was a good candidate for 15 minutes five years ago, and now he acts like he’s Bill Murray in Groundhog Day,’ Matt Canter, DSCC spokesman, told Politico on Tuesday. 'Every morning he wakes up and pretends it’s still January 2010.'

That January Brown was competing in a special election to fill late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's seat. His Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Martha Coakley, made a number of missteps in the shortened campaign season, and Brown improbably won the election.

Brown won't be so lucky this time, however, Canter said. 

'The fact is that Jeanne Shaheen is one of the most popular senators in the country, and every poll shows voters know that Brown is out for himself and not the people of New Hampshire,' the Democratic Party spokesman said.
