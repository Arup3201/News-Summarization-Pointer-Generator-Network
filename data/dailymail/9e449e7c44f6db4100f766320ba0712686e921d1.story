Hasbro is under fire from parents who are outraged over a penis-shaped part in a Play Doh cake decorating set.

The toymaker has been attacked by moms and dads who bought the innocent-looking Sweet Shoppe Cake Mountain Playset for their loved ones - and were shocked at the toy's phallic connotations.

The piece in question, which is around the length of a thumb, is a mock frosting applicator, which the company refers to as an 'extruder'. It is one of many parts in the $20 set.

Unfortunate: Parents reacted with shock when they realized this Play Doh attachment is shaped like a penis

'Extruder': The item is meant to squeeze out colored 'frosting' for toy cakes when squeezed against a plunger, shown above inside the device

In action: One parent - who was not put off by the design - posted the above photograph of the toy in action to the Play Doh Facebook page, which has been the target of irate consumers

Children are supposed to fill the tube with colored frosting, inset a plunger, then squeeze the synthetic goo out of one end, by pressing down against two protrusions at the base.

Angry consumers flocked to the brand's social media channels to blast the company for the ill-thought out design.

Mom Mari Ramirez said: 'As a customer as well as being a mom I'm very disappointed in you guy.....my kids love your product....shame I have to start to re look at u guys before I buy!!!! Plz change

Diane Goss Lamb wrote to the company: 'It is so obviously inappropriate, that I have a hard time believing that no-one in your company stopped this from being approved and distributed in the first place.'

Size: The item, about the length of a thumb, prompted a re-think from Hasbro, who have now replaced the part

Chrismtas gift?

Jennifer Turner wrote: 'This is NOT okay - this completely ruined our Christmas.' 

But some parents saw a funnier side to the controversy, and said they were happy with the product as it was.

Take two: Hasbro later said it had replaced the part with a less suggestive one - believed to be the above banana-shaped device

XZY said:All these people complaining. Pretty sure your kid did not know or notice what this may or may not resemble. These issues belong to the adults. Wait till they start asking for bananas to be made in a different shape.

Kasey Marie said: 'Just want to say that while we did notice later on what the extruder kinda looks like, we aren't bothered by it because it's a kids' toy.

'Those making a fuss are people who look for something to complain about in everything.'

The deluge of complaints eventually prompted Hasbro to create a replacement part, which resembles a banana. Hasbro promised any unhappy buyers can replace the part with the new one for free.

In a statement posted online, Hasbro said: 'We have heard some consumer feedback about the extruder tool in the Play-Doh Cake Mountain playset and are in the process of updating all future Play-Doh products with a different tool.

'Should any consumer want a replacement extruder for this item, they can contact Hasbro’s Customer Service Department.'
