A doctor who is being sued for amputating a truck driver's penis without his permission during a supposedly routine circumcision has defended his actions by claiming he saved the man's life.

Dr John Patterson, who performed the surgery in 2007, said that during the operation on Phillip Seaton, 64, he discovered a rare and deadly cancer.

'What I saw was not a penis. What I saw was cancer,' Dr Patterson told the court in Shelby County, Kentucky.

'Loss of service': Phillip Seaton and his wife Deborah are suing a doctor who removed part of his penis without permission during surgery

Dr Patterson said he removed less than an inch of Mr Seaton's penis. The rest of the penis was amputated by another doctor later, said the doctor's lawyer, Clay Robinson.

However, Mr Seaton was appalled at the doctor's decision to amputate without consulting him, or giving him the opportunity to seek a second opinion.

His wife Deborah is also a plaintiff in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages for 'loss of service, love and affection.'

In earlier testimony, Mr Seaton described the moments after being told part of his penis had been removed.

'I pulled the dressing down, and I didn't see nothing,' said Mr Seaton.

'Then I came out of the restroom and I said, "I'm getting the hell out of this damn hospital."'

Evidence: Hundreds of medical documents have been filed with the court for the jury to examine

Dr Patterson testified that the cancer prevented him from inserting a catheter into Mr Seaton's urethra, and he was concerned about the possibility of kidney damage from urinary retention.

Although Mrs Seaton was in the hospital waiting room, the doctor said he did not consult her because she had not accompanied her husband to office visits or into the pre-operation area, which he thought was unusual.

'My impression was she would not be someone I would ask what he would want,' Dr Patterson testified.

Mrs Seaton testified that if the 
doctor had consulted her after finding the cancer, she would have 
advised him to halt the surgery and wake up her husband.

'It's his body,' she said. 'He should have a say in it.'

Love lost: Mrs Seaton is also suing Dr Patterson for loss of 'service and affection'

Mr Seaton had earlier testified about his emotional state since the surgery, saying he was a 'bad case'.

'I didn't have no say in it,' he testified.

'I wasn't told what had to be done. It was just done.'

Mr Seaton testified that Dr Patterson had told him he would cut foreskin during the circumcision and described it as 'more or less in and out.'

He said he had even joked with the doctor about the procedure.

During opening arguments, Robinson said Mr Seaton had before the surgery initialed a document authorizing treatment in unforeseen circumstances.

Mr Seaton's lawyer, Kevin George, said the document had been read to Mr Seaton because he cannot read.

The jury of eight-women and six-men was shown graphic images.

Mr George presented four photographs of Mr Seaton's groin saying, 'You can see there's nothing there.'

He also told jurors that Mr Seaton 'doesn't feel like a man' anymore.

Mr Robinson offered up a photograph of the cancerous tip of a penis - not Mr Seaton's.

Mr Seaton's brother, David Seaton, testified that Phillip Seaton has been depressed and angry since the surgery.

'The spark is gone out of his life. He used to be such a happy person,' David Seaton testified.

The case continues.
