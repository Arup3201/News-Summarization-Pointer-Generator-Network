Night club promoters who released a video of students joking about girls being raped have been condemned by police.

The event, called ‘Fresher’s Violation’, was being hosted by the events company TequilaUK at Mezz Club in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

The film, which was used to promote the night, featured clips of male clubbers talking about ‘violating’ other students with one suggesting a girl was going to 'get raped'.

Shameful: A grab from the promotional video which was made by Tequila to promote their student night out

West Yorkshire police investigated and said the footage was ‘highly inappropriate and sexually suggestive.'

A report published by the force said young men were ‘being encouraged to engage in violent sexual acts against females’ and that the video 'encourages violent sex, degrades women and poses a ‘real threat to public safety’.

During the clip, a presenter went around the venue, interviewing clubbers and asked: 'How are you going to violate a fresher tonight?'

One student replied by saying: 'I’ve got one here with me who’s just disappeared.

Anger: Students protested at the video featuring jokes about girls being raped last Thursday night outside Mezz at a demonstration attended by more than 160 people. A petition has gathered more than 3,000 signatures

He then waits for a few seconds before she returns and says 'There she is.'

Then the promotional staff member asks: 'And what are you going to do to her tonight?.'

The student replies: 'Well she’s paying for the cab, she’s paying for the drinks,' before adding 'She’s going to get raped.'

Another said: 'Violate is a very strong word. I’m going to take advantage of someone.'

Venue: The controversial night was held at Mezz Bar Leeds which is having its licence reviewed by the city council

The presenter also asks one student: 'How are you going to bring girls back to your little den?'

The video was taken down from YouTube and Facebook after receiving negative comments and Tequila UK have since apologised.

As a result of the controversy Mezz Club could be stripped of its licence by Leeds City Council, who are reviewing the case.

Students took to Tequila UK’s Facebook page to criticse the sickening promotional campaign.

One
 student wrote: 'What made you think that advocating rape and sexual 
assault was ever an okay thing to do, let alone in a poor attempt to 
promote your club nights?

Defence: The club's managers claim over the last six years the promotion company has been 'responsible' and well behaved

'This is the definition of rape culture. Disgusted.'

Students launched a petition with thousands of signatures in opposition and a late-night protest was staged outside the club.

Leeds University Feminist Society have also said they are keen to work on a zero tolerance campaign against sexual assault at venues around the city centre.

A spokesperson for Tequila UK posted a statement on Facebook at the time which read: 'This video has been removed whilst we investigate thoroughly.

'We do not normalise, excuse, tolerate or condone rape or sexual abuse of any sort. Tequila has promoted a safe environment for students to enjoy themselves responsibly for the last 21 years.

The Tequila video prompted outrage 
because it was a particularly extreme example of a culture in which the 
trivialisation of rape is seen as 'banter'

'We will continue to maintain our duty of care as we always have done. We apologise for any offence that has been caused.'

Police are also looking into free-pouring - where bar staff pour alcohol straight into customers’ mouths from the bottle, which contradicts licencing laws.

A statement issued by Mezz said: 'We have taken this matter very seriously.

'Over the last six years that we have worked with Tequila UK, they have proved themselves to be very responsible promoters.

'Their clientele are always polite and well behaved and we have never had any reports of serious offences in relation to the night.

'We are cooperating fully with the licensing authority and we hope to resolve this matter swiftly.'

The night was banned in Newcastle two years ago after posters depicting a woman performing a sex act on another man were distributed around houses in the area.

Leeds University Union and Leeds 
Metropolitan University Union have both voiced their support for the 
campaign to stop the event.

Emma Friend, Leeds University Union's Equality and Diversity officer, said: 'The Tequila video prompted outrage because it was a particularly extreme example of a culture in which the trivialisation of rape is seen as 'banter'.

'It provoked a reaction from a diversity of students and residents, which was demonstrated at our protest last Thursday night at which over 160 people attended and the petition which gathered over 3000 signatures.

'I think that rape culture and lad banter are not problems that are specific to Leeds but stem from societal attitudes towards sexual consent and objectification which are prevalent everywhere.

'We are now creating a zero tolerance pledge for nightclubs to sign up to, which will mean that they have to introduce zero tolerance to sexual harassment policies and refrain from using sexual objectification in their advertising.'

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Licensing officers have been made aware and have spoken to the promoters and the venue's management.

'They are continuing to assess the situation.'
