Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been named in the trial of 46 alleged Islamic extremists

Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been named in the trial of 46 alleged Islamic extremists who are accused of brainwashing young men in Belgium into travelling to Syria where many are now fighting for Islamic State.

Belgian prosecutors have linked the British cleric to Fouad Belkacem, the leader of a now-disbanded extremist group, Sharia4Belgium, which was established under Choudary’s guidance to campaign for sharia law in that country.

Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday purport to show how British Islamists arranged a meeting with Belkacem. 

There is also a transcript that is said to be of a telephone conversation between Choudary and Belkacem in which Choudary offers guidance on cultivating followers.

While Belkacem has not fought in Syria, the court in Antwerp has heard that he was the main driver behind the organisation.

He is currently serving a jail term for inciting hatred against non-Muslims.

There was no suggestion in the Belgian court that Choudary was involved in any alleged brainwashing or suspected terrorist activity. 

The documents also reveal that another one of Choudary’s followers, Rahin Aziz, has strong links to Belkacem. 

Aziz, who uses the assumed name of Abdullah al-Britani, fled Britain for Syria in March before being convicted in his absence of violence in the UK.

He is now believed to be fighting with IS.

In a video analysed by the Belgian authorities, Aziz threatens the use of violence unless Belkacem is released. He says: ‘We Muslims will not stop until we see our brother released or we will die on this path.’

The terror trial is one of the biggest to be staged in Europe.

Belgian prosecutors have linked the British cleric, pictured in London in 2011, to Fouad Belkacem, the leader of a now-disbanded extremist group, Sharia4Belgium, which was established  to campaign for sharia law
