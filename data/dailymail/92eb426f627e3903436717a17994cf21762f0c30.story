A Chicago woman has given new meaning to the concept of putting someone under house arrest.

The 36-year-old was in the garage of her home in Portage Park, in the Cragin area on the city's northwest side, at about 7.30pm on Saturday.

She was suddenly approached by Andre Bacon, 21, from Roseland, who repeatedly demanded the keys to her 2012 Acura MDX, according to The Chicago Tribune.

Trapped: Andre Bacon, 21, was held on $75,000 bail after he allegedly tried to steal a woman's car from her garage, only to get trapped inside when the woman closed the garage door

The victim handed them over, but then quickly fled from the garage, smartly shutting the door behind her.

The would-be thief was trapped in her garage, which could only be accessed by the door.

The woman then ran down the street to call police.

When officers arrived a few moments later, they found Bacon trapped inside the garage.

He was sitting inside the car with the keys in the ignition, court documents state.

Bacon was taken into custody.
