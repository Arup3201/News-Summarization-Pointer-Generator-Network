Crystal Palace have a wide-ranging list of possible candidates to replace manager Neil Warnock, who was sacked on Saturday.

The list includes Derby’s Steve McClaren, ex-Porto boss Vitor Pereira and former Palace players Tony Popovic and Gareth Southgate.

However, Tony Pulis, who saved Palace from relegation last season before leaving in acrimonious circumstances on the eve of this campaign, has been effectively ruled out of contention. The Palace board do not envisage being able to work with him and Pulis, himself, says there is ‘no chance’ he will go back.

Warnock, 66, was told that he was being fired yesterday morning, the day after Palace lost 3-1 at home to Southampton and just four months after his second stint as Palace manager began.

He became the first Premier League casualty of the season after Palace co-chairman Steve Parish took what he described as the ‘unfortunate decision’ to fire him.

Palace have won just once in their last 12 Premier League games and have dropped into the relegation zone, albeit within one point of safety and two wins from mid-table.

The fear of Palace falling back into the Championship and off the Premier League gravy train, allied with doubts that Warnock is the right man to spend transfer window funds, underpinned the decision.

Keith Millen has taken over as caretaker manager for today’s trip to QPR and could remain in charge for the New Year’s Day visit to Aston Villa.

Parish has reportedly already spoken to Pereira, who was considered by Everton as David Moyes’ successor before Roberto Martinez was given the job.

The bookmakers’ early favourite for the job was former Spurs manager Tim Sherwood, although he was considered and did not get the post when Palace were looking to replace Pulis.
