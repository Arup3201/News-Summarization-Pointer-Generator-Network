She may have lost most of her life savings at the hands of infamous ponzi-schemer Bernie Madoff, but one of his many victims says that losing almost everything was, in a way, a 'blessing.'

Helen Davis Chaitman is a New York attorney who invested heavily with Madoff before his empire of fraud came crumbling down around him - and those who trusted him with their money.

But Chaitman says she learned a lot about herself and others after nearly losing everything.

After losing nearly everything because of Bernie Madoff, Helen Chaitman says the experience actually was a blessing

Since Madoff's collapse, Chaitman has represented many of his victims free of charge as they try to recoup some of their losses. She's also started lobbying lawmakers to change some of the loopholes that allowed Madoff to bilk his investors to the tune of nearly $20 billion.

'The really gratifying thing in life is to help other people and to give
to other people, and I think in a way it was a blessing to go through 
this experience because it taught me that,' Chaitman told HuffPost 
Live. 'I hadn't been as sensitive to the fact that my real 
pleasure in life comes from helping other people.'

Chaitman says the ordeal made her reassess how she looks at money and wealth.

'I did focus on money more than I should have, and I don't think it 
brings you the happiness that a lot of people feel it does,' she said.

Regardless of how much happiness it brings her, Chaitman says she is 'no longer casual about money and never again will be.'

Villain: Madoff bilked nearly $20 billion from those who invested with him in the largest ponzi scheme ever

She says she now has a 'totally different perspective.' 

'I'm paranoid about investments,' she said. 'I don't trust anyone on Wall Street and I think I have good reason not to.'

On December 11, 2008, Madoff was arrested at his apartment by FBI agents after he invited them in and acknowledged knowing why they were there.

An FBI agent wrote in a criminal complaint lodged against Madoff: 'After I stated, “We're here to find out if there's an innocent explanation,” Madoff stated, “There is no innocent explanation.”'

Different perspective: Chaitman says he experience with Madoff makes her appreciate giving to others more than she did before

Several months later, Madoff pleaded guilty to fraud charges, maintained he had acted alone and was sentenced to 150 years in prison.

Madoff, 75, is imprisoned in North Carolina as his victims are still in the process of recovering the money they lost at the hands of Madoff.
