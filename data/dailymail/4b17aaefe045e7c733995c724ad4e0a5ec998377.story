Bahamian authorities have arrested two men after an American businessman was found stabbed to death outside a seaside resort.

Carl Yerger, 45, of Ruscombmanor, Pennsylvania, was found dead Saturday on the grounds of the Bimini Big Game Club, about 50 miles east of the Florida coast, officials said.

Yerger is said to have gotten into a fight late Friday night with spring breakers that turned deadly, police told the Bahamas Press. Results of an autopsy have yet to be made public.

The married father of two was found by a resort employee, authorities told WFMZ. His body had multiple stab wounds, NBC Philadelphia reported.

'He was a wonderful man,' his wife told the Philadelphia Inquirer, 'he will be missed.'

He was staying at a popular deep sea fishing resort on business, his wife told NBC Philly, but the nature of that business is not clear.

Police took a total of four people into custody, including two American citizens, but their exact charges are not known. 

A police source said Yerger knew his supposed attackers.

‘They were all captain and crew of a vessel that was in the marina right there at the hotel,’ the cop told WFMZ.

Also not known is if the killing was related to argument, a drug bust in the area just hours before his death, or if it was simply a random attack, both the Bahamas Press and NBC Philly reported.

Yerger was well-known in the community, the president of the Oley Valley Youth Sports League.

‘This was a decent, decent man and a decent family. My husband and I are literally sick over this,’ a neighbor told WFMZ. ‘They need to be punished for what they did. It's unacceptable behavior,’

‘It was a major shock to my family and everybody in the development here of an awesome person that we're going to be missing,’ another neighbor told the station.

‘He was unique, caring, ambitious, detailed, organized, courageous, a problem solver, and mediator,’ a statement posted to the league’s website said. ‘His efforts earned him the support and loyalty of both new and long-time volunteers and coaches.’

All games this coming weekend have been cancelled in his memory.

The investigation into his death remains ongoing.
