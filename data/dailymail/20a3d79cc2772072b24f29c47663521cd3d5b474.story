As any expectant mother will tell you, when you've got to go, you've got to go.

Fortunately for six months pregnant Karen Gunner, when nature called she was in a fast food restaurant.

So while her partner and their friends queued to order and pay for their food, she nipped to the loo.

But that was when disaster struck. For Miss Gunner found herself barred from the Burger King toilets – because she didn't have a receipt for a meal.

She tried pleading with staff, explaining that she was heavily pregnant, but they remained unmoved. Eventually, with the situation becoming pressing, she had to leave the restaurant and head somewhere else.

Last night Miss Gunner said she had found the whole situation embarrassing and accused Burger King of 'disgraceful behaviour'. The company has now apologised.

The incident took place at the same Burger King branch in North Road, Brighton, where in March last year another pregnant woman left in tears after being told she would have to pay £1 to use the toilets. 

In Miss Gunner's case, her partner Dan Weston and their friends were queuing to order while she rushed to the washrooms. But a member of staff said she would not be allowed in until she could show a proof of payment from the tills.

The 31-year-old said the decision to prevent her using the toilet was 'absolutely disgraceful behaviour' 

Miss Gunner said: 'I was furious. I pointed out that my friends were in the queue and that I was clearly heavily pregnant, asking for a little leniency, but again I was refused.

'It's quite obvious I'm pregnant and I specifically pointed it out to them. But she just said, 'Sorry, that's our policy'. As I was unable to use the toilet we had to leave before my partner ordered our lunch.

'I was left feeling extremely embarrassed at being turned away from using the toilet. I found this to be absolutely disgraceful behaviour.

'I tried to speak to the member of staff serving my friend and they still said there was nothing they could do. The whole thing just felt so silly. They could see we were waiting. While I understand people do come in to use facilities only, my partner could clearly be seen ordering.'

A Burger King spokesman said: 'I would like to assure you that all pregnant women, whether they are customers or not, are allowed to use our washrooms at all times.

'It appears that one of the temporary Christmas staff was not informed about the policy. I have phoned the restaurant manager and discussed this unacceptable situation with him. He has assured me he will speak to all his staff to reiterate the company policy on this matter.'

She said: 'It's quite obvious I'm pregnant' but was denied entry to the toilet because it was company policy
