The 25-year-old also looked in good 
spirits as he made his way to his waiting car, smiling slightly as he 
was aided by a friend on his journey.

Despite
the accident, which potentially could have been fatal, Danny has 
retained his sense of humour, and tweeted after leaving hospital: 'My 
ribs are a bit sore... Feel like I've been hit by a bus.'

Danny
was lucky not to have been injured further in the accident, which 
occurred following the 14-bar pub crawl with his rugby teammates.

Witnesses
said they saw the group 'running around drunkenly in the road' just 
before the smash at 20.39pm on Wednesday evening, with one adding: 
'Every bit of the bus front window is smashed to pieces, imagine what 
the guy looks like.'

The group of friends had adopted a 
'Wizard of Oz' theme for the event, beginning at Woody's just before 
2pm, with Danny's teammate Will Addison tweeting 'And so it begins'.

Stuart McCall, duty manager of the 
Eldon pub told student paper The Tab that the group were very drunk, adding: 'They
had beer bongs and funnels and spent £200 in 15 minutes.

'They were stopping traffic in the Hyde Park crossing, and when I refused to serve three of them they ran down the road.'

Danny's
manager James added: 'It was a group social, I don't think you can 
single out Danny for certain behaviour. I haven't spoken to him yet but 
he is at home recovering and is a bit shaken up.'

He also said that Danny was never refused service during the crawl.

Concerned: Kelly shielded her eyes behind sunglasses as she was seen in the capital

Funny side: Despite her initial worry, Kelly gave her injured boyfriend a nickname later on Thursday afternoon

After being treated at the scene in 
Woodhouse Lane, in the north of the city, for a concussion, Danny was taken to the nearest 
hospital to have further scans and investigations completed.

Writing on his Twitter page on Thursday afternoon, Danny confirmed he had since been discharged from hospital, tweeting: 'Out of hospital now. Once again, thank you for the messages.'

The Sale Sharks star's manager James Williamson told the BBC Cipriani is 'quite groggy' and 'does not remember much about the incident.'

'At the moment there doesn't seem to 
have been any serious damage done. We don't how long he will be out for.
It looks like he has been a lucky boy,' added Williamson.

Bus company First said Danny 'ran 
suddenly into the road' colliding with its number 6 bus which was 
'travelling at a safe speed'.

'The police have investigated this 
incident and have reported that First and its driver are not at fault.  
We understand the pedestrian is an England rugby international, and we 
wish him a speedy recovery', the spokesman added.

Danny's model girlfriend Kelly was back in London, filming the latest episode of ITV2 show Celebrity Juice.

It is understood that Danny's friends and management team frantically attempted to contact the model following the accident.

Despite her worry, she did managed to tweet Cipriani when he left hospital, dubbing him 'flat white'.

After he thanked the Celebrity Juice Twitter feed for the 'get well soon' message, Kelly wrote: '@DannyCipriani87 @celebjuice Your New Name #FlatWhite.'

Loved up: Kelly and Danny rekindled their relationship following her split from Thom Evans (pictured, the pair together in February)

Ace: Danny was out with his Sale Sharks teammates - they are believed to have gone on the famous Otley pub crawl

Staff at the Leeds hospital where 
Cipriani was being treated were today hoping Brook would visit, with 
nurse Stephanie Burnett tweeting: 'Bit of celeb spotting at work 
tonight... Shame I’m not a rugby fan! Maybe Kelly Brook will come for a 
visit?! #makemyshiftintresting.'

Earlier his agent told The Sun: 'He was running across the road and just misjudged the speed of the bus.'

Danny and his teammates had been enjoying themselves on the infamous 'Otley Run' pub crawl.

Unaware: Kelly appeared unaware of the incident as she arrived back home after recording an episode of Celebrity Juice on Wednesday night

Still smiling: Kelly looked in good spirits as she called it a night and returned home

Pub crawl: Danny was on the popular Otley Pub Crawl which takes in 14 boozers in Leeds

The Otley Run pub crawl is a popular 
choice for stag dos and 
starts at Woodies Ale House, ending at The Dry Dock.

Images from the evening showed the sportsman with his face painted, as the team had dressed up for the night out.

Following the incident, one witness 
expressed his shock on Twitter, writing: 'Some guy's been hit by a bus 
outside Leeds uni and every bit 
of the bus front window is smashed to pieces, imagine what the guy looks
like.'

And student Molly Bridgeman, 18, 
added: 'The front right corner of the bus was caved in. There were four 
police cars there. It was horrific.'

A
passenger who was on the bus that hit Cipriani, Erin Bailey, said: 'I 
saw him go in front of the windscreen, but I didn't see him running out 
but we could see them before that running in and out of the road'.

Student
Ellie Parkes said: 'The front was really smashed up. The scene was 
quite chilling, his friends were all there by the ambulance still in 
fancy dress, not really knowing what to do.

'According to a lady I spoke to, minutes before they were all drunkenly running about in the road.'

But seemingly unaware of the incident, Kelly looked in good spirits as she returned home after the show, smiling 
widely as she made her way out of her car.

MailOnline has contacted Danny's spokesperson for further comment.
