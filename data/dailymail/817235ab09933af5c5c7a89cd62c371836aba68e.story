The stress of holiday shopping can bring the worst out of some people.

The alleged incident took place last Sunday.

Grandma jailed: Diana Hendren, 49, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, was arrested on child abuse charges after allegedly choking her granddaughter 

An employee at the store came upon Ms Hendren trying to throttle her granddaughter and called 911, according to reporting by the station KOAT..

The staffer reportedly intervened after hearing the child scream, 'don't choke me.'

When confronted by police, the 49-year-old Diana Hendren said she became angry at the child for dropping her money on the floor.

The girl was taken to a nearby hospital for a check-up.

Meanwhile, her grandmother was hauled off to the county jail on child abuse charges.

Seven years earlier, the woman was taken into custody on a failure to appear warrant.
