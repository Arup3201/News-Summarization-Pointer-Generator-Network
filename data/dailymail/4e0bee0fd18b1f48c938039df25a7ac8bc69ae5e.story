The storm that hit Britain on Friday and blew away across the North Sea yesterday will be the last on the ‘conveyor belt’ of severe depressions that have ravaged the country since December, the Meteorological Office said last night.

The cause of the storms is the jet stream – the high altitude band of wind girdling the planet.

For the past eight weeks, a Met Office spokesman said, this has been the cause of a ‘continuous string’ of storms across the UK.

Because the jet stream’s course has been unusually straight, this has increased the storms’ ferocity.

It has been fixed in one position – with Britain directly in the firing line.

But from today, the spokesman said, this is set to change: ‘The jet stream is going to be much more like it usually is, with a buckled, more convoluted shape.

'It will also move more, both to south and the north of the country.

'It is going to stay unsettled for another week.

'There will be rain at times on Monday and again on Thursday. But it will be normal winter weather, not the extreme conditions experienced lately.’

Because the ground is so saturated, even that may cause problems. But slowly, the spokesman added, the weather is set to become drier, although he pointed out that the further ahead forecasts are made, the less reliable they become. That said, the week after next is looking more settled.

‘It is a slowly improving picture,’ the spokesman said. ‘We have seen the last of this sequence of intense storms.’

The Met Office does not offer detailed forecasts more than five days ahead, but the American website AccuWeather predicts mild sunny days by mid-March.
