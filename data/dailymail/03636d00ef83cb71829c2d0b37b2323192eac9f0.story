For most parents, the moment their baby’s umbilical cord is cut is over in seconds.

But some families are choosing to dwell over the so-called ‘sacred severance’ by burning the umbilical cord slowly.

As bizarre as it sounds, those who have done it claim that cord burning acts as another way of bonding a new family.

Families from Santa Cruz, California, are choosing to burn through their baby's umbilical cord using a candle instead of relying on a doctor with a clamp and scissors. Those who have used the 'cord burning' technique say it is a bonding experience. A family that wishes to remain anonymous is pictured

Samantha Geston, who lives in Santa Cruz,
 California, is among the mothers who have chosen to avoid doctors with a
 clamp and scissors to cut the umbilical cord in seconds.

Instead, she opted to burn through the cord slowly with a lit candle.

The practice has been around in some cultures for hundreds of years as a way of lowering the chance of infection and bleeding after birth.

Mrs Geston said that her parents, husband and daughter all took turns at holding the candle underneath the cord, until it burned through in 20 minutes.

‘It was really magical and everyone was 
so happy and it was just the perfect way to end a beautiful pregnancy 
and a beautiful birth,’ she told Today Parents.

Mrs Geston said she was not worried that 
her new son would be burned by the flame as the cord was stretched out 
away from him so that it was connected to the placenta in a bowl by the 
side of the bed.

Cord burning involves people burning through a baby's umbilical cord.

It has been done for centuries to lower the risk of infection and bleeding after birth.

There are different methods, but cordburning.com recommends positioning the baby on its side.

A 'burn box' is placed next to the baby and the umbilical cord in the notches on the side of the box.

Candles are lit and placed in a position so that the flames are under the cord.

'There is a sizzling and a little smoke. There will be a "pop" at some point then the blood gases escape, which is normal and only happens once,' the website says.

The candles sometimes need to be relit if they are extinguished by escaping fluid and the process does create a unique smell.

Reports of the practice, depending on the technique used, say it can take between 10 minutes and an hour for the cord to be severed.

Parents knot the final piece of remaining cord attached to the baby, which gradually shrivels up and eventually drops off.

Some people use a ‘burn box’ with grooves to hold candles and collect dripping wax, to make the process safer.

A photographer called Paige Discoll, of Santa Cruz Birth Photography, who is herself expecting a baby, recorded the event and said she too now wants the family event.

‘I want my four boys to be involved in the birth of their baby brother,’ she said.

‘Too many times during birth, everything happens so quickly.

'This is a really slow and gentle process that slows everything down and makes it so memorable.’

Cord 
burning was traditionally used to lower the risk of infection after 
birth by sterilising the tissue and cauterising blood vessels to stop 
bleeding.

But modern methods negate the need for the process, Dr Iffath Hoskins of NYU Langone Medical Centre explained.

She
 noted that there is no reason to stop cord burning as long as 
precautions are taken to stop the baby being burnt or the risk of a fire 
as the result of the open flame.

Experts are divided about the ideal time to cut the cord, but The World Health Organisation suggests that the severance should take place between one and three minutes after birth.

Because the blood flow between the baby and the placenta stops quite quickly, the extra time taken to burn the cord does not affect the health of the baby, Dr Hoskins said.

A spokesperson for the Royal College of Midwives told MailOnline: 'Normally it takes between three and 25 minutes after the birth for all the blood and nutrients to pass from the placenta to the baby.

'After the baby is born there is no longer any circulation in the placenta, so it’s dead tissue and full of blood - creating the  perfect  environment for bacteria and infection.

'These are the potential risks of cord burning that parents should be aware of, but midwives will always support women and their partners and respect their choices after giving birth.'
