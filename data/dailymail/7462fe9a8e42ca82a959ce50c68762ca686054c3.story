Fiorentina's sporting director Daniele Prade is optimistic that Manchester United target Juan Cuadrado will sign a contract extension at the club.

The 26-year-old has attracted the attention of the Premier League giants and other top European teams after enjoying a stellar World Cup with Colombia in the summer.

Interest in the talented Colombian saw the Viola slap a £40million valuation on the player in a bid to deter United away from their star man.

'Both parties are discussing the situation and we want to do everything with the greatest serenity for everyone involved. We are hope to soon find a point of agreement.'
