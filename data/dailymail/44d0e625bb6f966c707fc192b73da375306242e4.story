He's best known for looking good in his underpants, but Britain's most successful male fashion model is now hoping to attract some attention to his very stylish feet.

The Billericay-born 34-year-old, who shot to fame wearing just his underpants in a Dolce & Gabbana campaign in 2006, is now the proud owner of footwear brand, David Preston.

David Gandy, who is dating The Saturdays' Mollie King, loved his pair of David Preston-designed Chelsea boots so much, he decided to buy the company.

The label will have a soft launch at London Collections: Men, which Mr Gandy is also an ambassador for, later in the week.

In an interview regarding his latest acquisition, the male supermodel, who has 230,000 followers on Instagram, told fashion website WWD: 'It was always my aim — which sounds really strange as a model — not to always be in front of the camera but to turn the other way and have an input.

'I don't just do one campaign and move on. I go in there, I look at the team and I want to help the brand move in a different direction.

He added: 'For me, that's the exciting part - I want to be involved. 

'Everyone thinks I turn up on set and go home afterward, but I'm probably the biggest pain in the a***. "Can we do this? Can we do that?" It's fun.'

Mr Gandy's plans for his new brand are to 'create a lifestyle' around the label and to think how men want to be seen in them. 

'It's having a cigarette and a whiskey after going out to a black-tie do or being in your classic car with your Chelsea boots on,' he suggests. 

The Chelsea boot is where this creative venture all began. 

The model owned a Paul Smith pair that he loved to death but when they finally wore out, he found it hard to replace them out of season.

When he heard about a Bethnal Green-based designer who specialised in similar styles, he decided to track him down.

'We met, had lunch, and he was a very interesting guy,' Gandy said in a recent interview with The Financial Times. 

'David is very creative — he'd worked as a nurse for 20 years, then taught himself how to make these boots when he couldn't find anything like them — and found a cult following.'

Fans of David Preston's trendy footwear include members of Blur, Kasabian, Iggy and the Stooges and Gandy.

The first collection since Gandy's acquisition in October launches this weekend at London Collections: Men, and then at the Tranoï trade show in Paris.

Their joint debut will be a 15-style collection, which will retail from £350 to £520.

According to Gandy, at that price they are aiming to: 'Rival the best at an attainable price.'

As well as the iconic Chelsea boot, the collection will also include Oxfords, brogues and monk straps that are more businesslike and other designs that include a touch of velvet or suede for a party vibe.

Gandy's latest foray into the business world is another feather in the model's cap as he is already a columnist for GQ and has two apps — one fashion-related and another for fitness. 

He is  also the face (and body) for his eponymous rage of underwear for Marks & Spencer, which launched last year.
