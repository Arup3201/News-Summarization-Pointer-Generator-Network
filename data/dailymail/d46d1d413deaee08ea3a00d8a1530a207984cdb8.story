The authorities have spent the past month reminding people to stay away from the coastline as Britain is battered by huge waves.

But these two uniformed detectives were left completely soaked yesterday after stopping to take a photograph of the 30ft waves battering Chesil Cove in Portland, Dorset.

The male and female officers were taken by surprise by the strength of the storm and were engulfed by one large wave just as they took their pictures.

Taking a shot: The police officers had stopped to take photographs at Chesil Cove in Portland, Dorset

Running away: The detectives were completely soaked after strong waves slammed into Chesil Cove in Dorset

Sheer force: The waves hit Chesil Cove with such force that the officers could not been seen for a moment

The pair, along with other bystanders, turned and ran away from the sea to avoid a further soaking.

But
 the two officers were going against their own force's advice on storm 
watching. Last month Dorset Police warned members of the public not to 
go to the coast to witness the storms.

In
 a statement they had stated: ‘At this time of adverse weather and 
severe flooding Dorset Police and partners issue the following strong 
advice:

‘Coastal areas are very dangerous at present - do not visit for sightseeing or to observe the waves.’

Advice: The force has been warning people to 'stay away' from seafronts because of dangerous large waves

Response: A Dorset Police spokesman said the officers had been 'engaged in a routine patrol in Portland'

A Dorset Police spokesman said today: 'The officers were engaged in a routine patrol in Portland and parked at a vantage point that had been used by the emergency services throughout the day.

'The
 clip shows that even areas considered to be safe during extreme weather
 conditions can be adversely affected by the elements.

'Our
 message to the public has not changed and we would urge people to take 
particular care in coastal or flooded areas and not to place themselves 
in danger.'

The Environment Agency had also been using the vantage point earlier in the day, police said.
