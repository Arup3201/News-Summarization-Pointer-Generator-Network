All identical twins have uncanny similarities. However, sisters Skye Turner and Tammin Butt would never have anticipated the striking parallels they have experienced as first-time mothers.

The 31-year-old Queensland sisters both gave birth to boys 14 weeks early - when both babies stopped growing in the womb at exactly 22 weeks and three days - after the siblings developed early onset pre-eclampsia.

But the string of coincidences don't stop there. The twins were also born premature, and their mother almost died after giving birth, as she suffered from the same condition - which is not known to be genetic.

The close-knit sisters had their baby boys two months apart 

The women, who had their babies just two months apart, can't quite believe the same emotional ride they have both been on. 

Although the twins are identical, and have a very strong bond, they still live independent lives. 

'We are not like those weird twins you see on TV who speak at the same time as each other - we are very similar but also quite different as well,' Tammin told Daily Mail Australia.

Tammin and her partner Blake Scoringe, from Brisbane, announced they were having a baby late last year - and two months later Skye and Mick Turner, from Bli Bli, shared the same exciting news.

Tammin was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia at just 25 weeks pregnant when her baby had stopped growing few weeks earlier, then a couple of days later on March 28, her son Jye was born weighing a tiny 480 grams.

Just six weeks after that, Skye was diagnosed with the same condition when her baby also stopped growing and Taylan was delivered a few weeks later on May 30 - weighing just 500 grams. 

The close-knit sisters admit that this is one journey they wished they had not shared together.

Tammin described the numerous similarities as a weird coincidence: 'It's like we are clones.' 

'When I told Skye to get tested after I had been diagnosed the doctors thought she was being silly and a bit over-the-top,' she said.

'They were quite surprised when they had to call her in the next day.'

Tammin said she felt bad for her sister who knew that she was about to endure including steroid and magnesium injections and blood pressure medication. 

But it was the unknown of whether their babies would survive the birth and the ongoing roller coaster during their long stints in intensive care that has been the hardest for the new mothers.

'The times when they get sick and things look bleak is particularly tough, ' she said. 'It's really hard to watch them in pain.' 

However, it's not all bad news as the babies are very cognitive and alert, Tammin says.

'It's nice to have light at the end of the tunnel, she said.

Both born at 26 weeks, Jye spent almost 100 days in intensive care while his younger cousin Taylan is four-and-a-half months old and remains in intensive care.

Finally going home in July, Kye is now six-and-a-half months old and weighs almost 5kg, but is still on oxygen due to complications of the premature birth. 

Taylan, who weighed in at 4.3kg on Tuesday, will hopefully be home for Christmas, but both babies will continue to need to be assisted with oxygen for an indefinite period of time until their lungs are properly formed.

Although the identical twins have a close bond -  they still live independent lives

The boys are little troopers enduring one obstacle after another including endless blood transfusions, spinal taps of the brain - not to mention morphine for the constant pain - and worst of all being resuscitated.

'You just have to believe in your little baby and not get caught up in everything that is wrong with them,' Tammin said.

'You have to back your baby and believe they are going to make it.'

Tammin is a travel agent and Skye works as an insurance rep but it will be quite some time before they can resume their jobs with such sick babies.

Both couples are struggling financially after constant ongoing medical costs - especially Skye who travels everyday from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane to be with her son.

'Skye is in hospital every day and we still spend more time in hospital than at home with ongoing problems from Jye being born so young,' Tammin said.

'It's disappointing to watch your savings go - that's another scary part of this.'

'We are looking down the barrel of not being able to do anything because we are running out of money but I try not to think about it.'
