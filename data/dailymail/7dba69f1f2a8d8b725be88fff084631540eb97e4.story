A man has been arrested after a schoolboy was fatally shot in the head near his family farm.

Police were called to the Lake District village of Ulpha, Cumbria, late on Thursday night where the boy was shooting with permission with two men.

The teenager, who has been named locally as Edward Gabbert, a Year 11 pupil at nearby Millom School, died at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital yesterday afternoon.

His condition had been described as critical and doctors were unable to save him. It is understood he died with his parents, Eleanor and Andrew, at his bedside.

An area surrounding an outbuilding half a mile from the family farm has been sealed off while officers investigate.

A statement by Cumbria Police said
they were called to the farm at 11.17pm on Thursday, after a 
15-year-old boy was shot in the head while people were shooting with 
permission.

It is understood the incident involved a shotgun.

A statement from Millom School said: 'Millom School can confirm that one of our Year 11 pupils has been 
involved in an incident at his home.'

DCI Mike Brown, left, said yesterday: 'This is still an active scene. We don't know what's gone on at this time.'

One of the two men, a 35-year-old from Barrow-in-Furness, has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and is helping police with inquiries.

The second man, in his 40s, was uninjured and has not been arrested.

None of the trio were related.

Tributes have been paid by Edward's schoolmates.

One wrote on Twitter: 'Crying my eyes out! Millom school has lost one of its greatest characters! Edward Gabbert'

Another friend Tweeted: 'He will be looking down on us all!'

One friend said: 'If someone told me I would have lost one of my best 
mates yesterday, I wouldn't believe them! I still can't believe them!'

The 15-year-old is survived by his mother Eleanor, father Andrew, brother Ian and sister Fiona.

Officers were still trying to establish how the incident happened last night.

DCI Mike Brown, speaking at the scene, said: 'This is still an active scene. We don't know what's gone on at this time.'

A spokesman for Cumbria Constabulary said that the force is currently supporting the teenager's family.

The boy has not yet been formally identified.
