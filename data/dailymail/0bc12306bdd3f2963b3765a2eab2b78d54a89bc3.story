See a piece of art you like and want to know more about it? Soon you could 'Shazam' it.

Shazam, the app created to recognise an artist from a few seconds of music, says it wants to branch out into identifying objects, such as food, paintings and books.

The London-based company behind
the mobile app has raised $30 million from several unidentified billionaires to finance the change.

'Shazam is already a verb,' chief executive Rich Riley told Reuters at the Mobile World Congress industry fair in Barcelona. 'We want to expand the universe of
what you can Shazam'

The latest funding comes on top of $40 million raised
from Mexican telecoms billionaire Carlos Slim in 2013.

Riley said these additional funds would help the
venture-capital backed company add to its 250-strong staff and
sign additional partnerships with publishers and content
companies.

The London-based company behind the mobile app has raised $30 million from several unidentified billionaires to finance the change. The company has yet to reveal details about how it would work, but one possibility is that such a service would work based on bar codes

'The famous blue button that our users love will remain on
the home screen but will be able to do much more,' he said.

Just in time for spring, scientists hope to launch a 'Shazam for birds' that will help people identify the tweets that are waking them up in the morning.

The app, dubbed Warblr, claims to be able to recognise the song of 88 bird species, and could help track their migration patterns.

Like Shazam, it works by recording nearby noises on smartphones to analyse it in real-time and identify the bird species according to its tweet

Whenever the app identifies a bird, geo-tracking allows it to map which species is being spotted where and when, with the information made public.

The information will be made publicly available to allow zoologists and ecologists monitor species growth and decline, as well as patterns of migration.

The company has yet to reveal details about how it would work, but one possibility is that such a service would work based on bar codes.

This would make it similar to Amazon’s Fire phone which can already identify products by scanning these codes.

Shazam has evolved markedly since 1999 when it was founded,
gaining popularity with its ability to recognise a piece of
music with the click of a button on the phone.

It now sells
songs that its users identify, having secured deals with all the
major streaming music services including Spotify and Deezer.

Lately it has also become a port of call for advertisers who
want to find ways to instantly link up with their target
audiences. 

Although Shazam does not disclose its revenues or other
financials, it says the latest funding round valued it at over
$1 billion.

It also has the attributes of a listed company, Riley said,
such as a strong brand, scale and revenue, although the company
is not yet profitable since it is still seeking to grow.

'Our business model is real and developed, not to be
determined like so many web apps or start-ups,' he said.
