Rio Ferdinand took to the streets of Rio de Janeiro to have a kickabout and do a question and answer with local children.

The former England and Manchester United centre back is in Brazil working as a BBC television pundit and he took to Instagram to show how he was filling in his spare time.

Ferdinand - a Mail on Sunday sports columnist - posted the photos of his visit to the Brazilian city's favelas on his Instagram, accompanied with the hashtag '#rioinrio'.

The 35-year-old is a free agent after leaving United at the end of last season and he has been heavily linked to QPR, Aston Villa, as well as clubs in the US and Turkey.

And while he was acting as a pundit alongside Alan Shearer, Theirry Henry and Gary Lineker for BBC's coverage of the Group B match between Holland and Spain last night, Ferdinand revealed that Robin van Persie and David Moyes did not gel.

'When Sir Alex Ferguson left, he went from being the star man, our go-to guy, the top scorer, to being almost like a sideshow,' said Ferdinand.

'I think that the dynamics changed.Â 

'The manager, David Moyes, was talking up Wayne Rooney and forwards need to be loved.'And I don't think he felt that love last season.'
