Pippa Middleton celebrated her 29th birthday in style last night, by cheering Andy Murray to victory in the US Open quarter-final.

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister donned a vibrant lacy yellow dress, nude wedges and carried a Wicker Delavan Terrace Bag in white at the match.

Once inside the courts she promptly took
 a seat next to dark-haired, 6ft 3in Spencer Vegosen - a Harvard 
graduate and accomplished tennis player - before watching the men's quarter final game unfold.

It is not the first time that Pippa 
has taken a seat next to Mr Vegosen, they both cheered Roger Federer to 
glory just a day ago on day nine of the competition.

Mr Vegosen, who now resides in New York but is originally from Illinois, Chicago  is a familiar face on the sporting scene and he was
 once one of the top junior tennis players in the U.S, winning 11 
sportsmanship awards. His father Jon is also president of the U.S.Tennis
 Association.

It is believed Mr Vegosen 
received a BA in East Asian studies and mathematics from Harvard 
University and spent last summer working in Hong Kong as an analyst for 
Goldman Sachs. However it is not known where he currently works.

The pair laughed and joked together at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in Flushing, Queens, New York.

Pippa was also joined by a brunette 
friend and the two seemed in high spirits as they clapped and cheered on
 the Scottish player who, from
 the dire straits of 6-3, 5-1 down when he could barely get the ball in 
the court, fought back to win 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-0 in three hours 
to keep his Grand Slam dream alive.

After finishing he was able to relax 
and see who his next opponent would be in his second straight semi-final
 at Flushing Meadows â€” whether it would be a rematch of his epic two 
clashes with Roger Federer at Wimbledon this year or a less expected 
contest with Czech powerhouse Tomas Berdych.

In
 the end Berdych shocked Federer in four sets and Murray now has two 
days to compose himself after making what was an awkward assignment 
against the 6ft 6in Croat look exactly that.

Avid tennis fan Pippa also attended the match between Tomas Berdych and Roger Federer, as his guest of honour in his box.

Roger Federer cut a disconsolate 
figure as he tried to come to terms with his shock quarter-final exit 
against an inspired Tomas Berdych at the US Open.

Not
 since 2003 had Federer lost before the semi-final stage at Flushing 
Meadows, winning five titles in that time, and he went into the 
tournament on a high after a stellar summer.

Pippa was spotted after the match bonding with Federer's wife Miroslava Vavrinec Federer as they left the stadium.

Since landing in the metropolis on Saturday to attend meetings about her
 upcoming book, Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and 
Friends, Pippa has been snapped with a number of men while sampling some
 of New York's finer delights.

In an opulent welcome hotelier Andre Balazs, who is reportedly worth 
more than $450 million, flew her by seaplane - a trip that costs $525 
for a single journey - to his resort, Sunset Beach, on Shelter Island on
 Sunday.

And later that evening the New York Daily News reported that she was 
spotted at the Electric Room at Dream Downtown in the Meatpacking 
district with former New York Ranger Sean Avery.

'She was only there for a short time,' a source told the paper, adding 
they were there with Mazdack Rassi, owner of photography company Milk 
Studios.

It has been suggested that Pippa is staying at the Carlyle Hotel located
 in the Upper East Side, where Roger Federer also has a suite, with two 
friends, where rooms start at $600 and reach $15,000 - without taxes.

Her trip, during which she is apparently courting the perks of fame, come despite her demands to remain out of the public gaze.

Pippa scored a style ace the day before when she watched Samantha Stosur of Australia play Victoria Azarenka of Belarus during the quarterfinals match

While newspapers have respected her request to be recognised as a 
private citizen, she still very much seems to be enjoying the 
high-flying life of a socialite.

Despite her request, U.S. news sites chose to publish photographs of her
 playing table tennis with Balazs over the weekend, but MailOnline has 
respected her wishes.

Pippa, who turns 29 today, is in town for meetings over her new 
book, which is out on October 30. She will not be holding an publicity 
events for the book while she is here, Viking publishers said.

Billed as a 'comprehensive seasonal guide to simple and creative 
entertaining', it is a book she hopes will cement her credentials as a 
party planner, and industry observers believe it could net her a small 
fortune in the process.

It is believed that Pippa is set to make an appearance at New York's Fashion Week, which kicks off on tonight.
