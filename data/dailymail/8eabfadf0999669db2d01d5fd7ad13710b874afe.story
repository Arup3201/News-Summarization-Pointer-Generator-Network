Orange is the New Black author Piper Kerman says her time behind bars taught her that justice in America depends on income and skin color.

Ms Kerman's memoir 
about her 13-month stint in federal prison is now a hit Netflix series starring 
Taylor Schilling, Laura Prepon and Jason Biggs.

'My time in the US criminal justice system 
made very real to me the huge inequality amongst Americans,' Ms Kerman said in a new interview with MailOnline.

True story: Author Piper Kerman's memoir Orange is the New Black was turned into a Netflix series

'Different 
people are treated very differently in our courtrooms depending on their
income and, sometimes, the color of their skin.'

Ms Kerman's very brief life of crime began shortly after graduating from Smith, when she smuggled a suitcase full of drug
money for her then-girlfriend, a high-end heroin importer. 

Her crime caught up to her a few years later, and she was sentenced to 15 months behind bars, which was reduced for good behavior.

'I think that I had to discover and rely on my
best self to survive the prison system,' Ms Kerman said.

After wondering if she would 'be pegged the snotty rich bitch' after seeing 'very West Side story' dorms with names 
like  'The Suburbs', 'The Ghetto' and 'Spanish Harlem', she quickly figured out that her best chance of survival was learning to fit in.

'The lessons I learned that 
stick with me I gleaned from the women I did time with, not from the 
correctional system, which teaches people how to be prisoners
and little else,' she says.

She says that it was the sense of community that made her time behind bars bearable. Small
acts of kindness, like a fellow prisoner buying her a root beer float 
when she couldn't access her commissary account, take on seismic 
importance.

While most prisoners do not have a high school 
education, Kerman had a degree, access to good lawyers and a fiance who wrote New York Times editorials about her plight.

'I was mercifully not subjected to prison healthcare,' she says, adding 
Netflix 
scene in which a 
woman is strapped to a bed and forced to take anti-psychotic medication 
isn't that far removed from reality.

'I believe that prisoners who do not want 
to take medication can be forced to comply with prison healthcare 
orders.'

She also got an up close and personal look at the cycle of addiction, and understand the role her crime played in the drug trade that affected so many of their lives. 

Despite the differences, Ms Kerman began to discover how closely their lives were linked - and could tell their story in a relatable way.

Show creator Jenji Kohan has said: 'You know, you're not gonna go into a network and say, "I want to talk 
about black women and Latina women and old women in prison." You need a way in. She was our gateway drug.'

to take medication can be forced to comply with prison healthcare 
orders'

The show also depicts the lighter moments and sometimes-bizarre prison routines. Some used prescription medicines and cigarettes to pass the time; Ms Kerman took up Dominos.

To battle boredom she also gossiped, 
read, microwaved 'prison cheesecake' from stolen butter, got prison 
pedicures from a fellow inmate, and discovered feminine hygiene products
could be to MacGyver everything from mops to makeshift dildos.

bars: The characters Ms Kerman met during her 15-month stint behind 
bars are fleshed out much more fully in the Netflix series

'We mainly used them as cleaning implements,' she admitted. 'I was impressed with the show's use of them in costuming.'

She still thinks about her time in prison - and the women she spent time with - every day and stays in touch with many of them.

'I have been in touch with the friends I made in prison, some for many 
years, and some have been in touch since the book published or the show 
aired,' she says. 'I am very grateful for these friendships.'

Since her release, Ms Kerman has 
become an advocate for prison reform through work with organizations 
including the Women's Prison Organization.

She admits that she was lucky: A friend created a job for her in his company. Most women, she says,don't have that option.

'The biggest obstacle for people coming home to live a legal life
is getting a job; so employment programs that teach real
skills and connect people to opportunity on the outside would make a 
huge difference,' she explains.

'However, it would be most effective to invest in 
education and employment opportunity earlier, so we don’t spend huge 
sums on prisons and jails in the first place.'

She's also gone from threatening to drown her ex-girlfriend in a toilet to forgiving her - and forgiving herself. 

She wrote: 'If I could forgive myself, I could prove that I was a strong, good person who could take responsibility for the path that I had chosen for myself, and all the consequences of that action.'
