Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia insists he is willing to forgive and forget Nick Faldo's comments about him being 'useless' at the 2008 defeat in Valhalla.

On the eve of the event at Gleneagles the former captain claimed the Spaniard had a 'bad attitude' in 2008 - Europe's only defeat since 1999 - when he scored just one point from four matches.

In the wake of Europe's eighth victory in 10 attempts against the United States Garcia was asked whether he had heard from Faldo.

Sergio Garcia said he had moved on from Faldo's comments after Europe sealed the Ryder Cup 

'I have not. I really wouldn't expect it anyway, but I've had it (congratulations) from everyone on this table (his team-mates) and a lot of other people and that's really what means a lot to me,' said the 34-year-old, whose five Ryder Cup successes means he has now surpassed Faldo's record as a player.

'I'm an open man and I'm always willing to forgive and forget. I think it was an unfortunate comment - I don't know if he regrets it or not

'I've moved on, and you know, I'm sure that everything will be okay.'
