Figures showing David Cameron has spectacularly failed to meet his promise to cut immigration will today be ‘buried’ under a slew of reports about the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Ministers were last night accused of ‘cynically’ timing the release of the Savile investigations by two government departments to coincide with the migration statistics.

Both will be released at 9.30am – with reports into the Savile’s paedophile abuse in at least 12 NHS hospitals and 21 children’s homes and schools certain to get blanket coverage.

Immigration figures scheduled for release tomorrow are expected to show that net migration has risen again to more than 260,000, despite the coalition pledging to cut it to 'tens of thousands' 

The publication of the 16 reports from locations around the country will be accompanied by a live press conference.

The migration statistics will be released without fanfare or a press conference by the independent Office for National Statistics. 

They are expected to show that net migration has risen again, to more than 260,000. 

The date has been fixed for months, with spin doctors acutely aware the figures could deliver a serious blow to the Prime Minister’s credibility.

The government is also expected to release 16 reports into Jimmy Savile. The papers have been ready for months and are already overdue

The Savile reports could have been released at any time and are already overdue.

Whitehall officials and MPs are convinced the date has been chosen deliberately. One said: ‘It is an open secret that’s what is going on.’

Unlike the immigration figures, no blame for the Savile affair can be laid at the Coalition’s door.

Last night Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: ‘Thursday, it is clear, is, for this Government, a good day to bury bad news.

‘By burying the latest immigration figures under the Savile news, they know that the statistics will be masked. One just has to wonder what else will be released across Whitehall tomorrow?’ 

Mr Cameron made reducing net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ a key 2010 election promise. Yet, despite some initial progress, it had reached 260,000 in the year to June 2014.

Experts believe today’s figures could be even worse – and will leave the Tories fighting the election with net migration higher than the 244,000 figure inherited from Labour.

Last week, the separate Labour Force Survey showed migrant workers were continuing to pour into the UK in huge numbers. Over 12 months, the number of Eastern Europeans rose by almost 200,000.

On Tuesday, David Cameron appeared to prepare the ground for a humiliating failure. He admitted he should cut benefits and tax credits for immigrants more quickly to stop Britain being such a ‘massive draw’.
