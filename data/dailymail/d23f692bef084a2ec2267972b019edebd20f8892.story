Michelle Cound has taken to Twitter to support her partner Chirs Froome

As sporting feuds go, it is perhaps one of the most heated.

The inter-team rivalry between Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome and the debate over who will lead Team Sky at this year's Tour de France has been setting the cycling world alight.

However, the latest war of words is not being waged by the world class cyclists, but instead, by one of their partners.

Mr Wiggins, who won the 2012 Tour de France with Froome finishing in second place, has claimed a decision on who will lead this team at this year's race will not be made until much nearer to the 29 June start date.

But Froome believes he has already been given the nod by the Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford to lead the British team's challenge as Wiggins focuses on winning the Giro d'Italia, which starts this weekend.

Mr Wiggins suggested during a recent interview Team Sky might run with both of them, hinting a possible co-leadership of the nine-strong Tour de France team.

But this did not seem to sit well with Mr Froome’s fiancee, Michelle Cound who branded the comments 'blatant lies' in a tweet, which has since been deleted.

Earlier this week she also told her near-10,000 Twitter followers: ‘Chris and Brad on the same start line, in the same kit? Mmm... doubt it.

‘To those claiming that this Wiggins/Froome thing is some sort of publicity stunt, you are wrong. I look forward to Team Sky clearing up this mess, asap. #fed up.’

Catherine Wiggins deleted her Twitter account. She had been defending her husband after he swore at paparazzi when he left hospital last November after being hit by a car.

Cound’s intervention followed a public spat this week between the two riders.

Wiggins triggered it on Monday by saying that he planned to win the Giro d’Italia — his main goal for 2013 — and then, contrary to expectations, to go on to defend his Tour title.

Froome responded a few hours later, reiterating his belief that he expected to be team leader as his reward for riding in support of  Wiggins during last year’s Tour, in which he finished second.

In a statement, Froome said: ‘There has been much speculation regarding the leadership for Team Sky at the Tour de France this year. I have made it clear  that winning the Tour would be my main objective for 2013.

‘I have been reassured by the management at Team Sky that I have their full backing and at no time has the leadership of the Tour been in question.’

It echoes a situation last summer when Mrs Wiggins and Ms Cound exchanged thinly veiled jibes online.

It came as Mr Froome was forced into a support role for his team captain.

Tensions first arose during stage 11 of the race, when Mr Froome was instructed to hold back so that Mr Wiggins could catch up and retain the leader's yellow jersey.

Ms Cound, a sports photographer tweeted: 'Team work is also about giving the people around you, that support you, a chance to shine in their own right.'

Mrs Wiggins quickly shot a Tweet back in response which praised other members of the Sky Team Mick Rogers and Richie Porte for 'genuine, selfless effort and true professionalism' -  but omitted Mr Froome.

This Tweet led to an immediate response from Ms Cound who replied: 'Don't think there are many other pro-riders who's partners know more about cycling than Chris's precisely & I know what happened just then.'

'If you want loyalty, get a Froome dog a quality I value although being taken advantage of by others!'

Peta Todd, the partner of Mark Cavendish, another of Mr Wiggin's teammates then weighed in to the row, apparently in support of Ms Cound.
