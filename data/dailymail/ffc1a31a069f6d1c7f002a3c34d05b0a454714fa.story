Bereft of friends or hope for five years and confined to a small room in a corner of the Government Niloufer Children’s Hospital in Hyderabad, Siamese twins Veena and Vani now face an uncertain future.

Having decided against surgery to separate the conjoined twins, the hospital doctors on Wednesday called their parents, N. Murali and Nagalaksmi, and told them to take the girls back home.

Their argument was that it was time for the kids to see the outside world, 'which is essential for their psychological and social development'. But those in the know claim that the fact is that taking care of the twins has become a burden for the cash-strapped hospital.

Uncertain future: Doctors have told the parents of twins Vena and Vani to take them home. Bu they say they cannot afford to

But the parents are in no mood to oblige: 'We are too poor to take care of them in this condition. I have two more daughters,' Murali, a casual labourer from Beerusettigudem village in Warangal district, said.

He also asked the government for 'some permanent employment', besides asking it to bear the medical expenditure of the twins.

'I have signed the consent form for the operation, whatever the consequence', he added.

Unfortunately, nine-year-old Veena and Vani understand the situation to some extent. But seeing their parents after nearly two years, they don’t have any attachment towards them.

Temporary reprieve: Hospital authorities have decided to keep the twins for the time being but have written to the government to look into the issue

'No, we want to stay in the hospital. We are happy here. After the operation, we want to go to school', Vani said.

Left with no option, the hospital authorities have decided to keep the twins for the time being.

'We have written to the government to look into the issue.

But it is essential to take them out of the hospital for their overall development', hospital in-charge superintendent Dr K. Ramesh Reddy said.

The doctors suggest that the government should shift them to an orphanage under the Women & Child Welfare Department, where they would get education and other facilities.

Nowhere to go: The girls have been living in a small room in the corner of the Government-run Niloufer Children's Hospital in Hyderabad
