It was the most terrifying frog to have ever hopped the Earth – and now scientists believe the ‘devil frog’ was even scarier than first imagined.

The ancient frog, named Beelzebufo ampinga, had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell.

It was the size of an African bullfrog, growing to about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across, and lived between 70 million and 65 million years ago.

The ancient frog, named Beelzebufo ampinga, had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell.  A new computer model for Beelzebufo ampinga's skeleton incorporates fossil specimens marked in dark blue. The scale bar at lower right marks roughly an inch in length

The species bone fragments have been collected for nearly two decades, but researchers have only recently pieced the fossils together to reveal its incredible features.

‘We knew it was big; we knew it was almost certainly predatory,’ said study co-author Susan Evans, a palaeontologist at the University College London told Live Science.

‘What the new material has shown us is that it was even more heavily armoured than we imagined.’

Study also found the devil frog was slightly smaller than previously thought. It was the size of an African bullfrog, which grows to about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across.

The devil frog’s name, Beelzebufo ampinga, came from Beelzebub, the Greek for devil, and bufo - Latin for toad.

Ampinga means ‘shield,’ named for an armour- like part of its anatomy.

The creature had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell.

It was the size of an African bullfrog, which grows to about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across, and lived between 70 million and 65 million years ago.

Even though it lived far away, Beelzebufo appears to be closely related to a group of frogs that live today in South America.

They are nicknamed ‘Pac-Man’ frogs due to their huge mouths.

Some have little horns on their heads, and the scientists think Beelzebufo also may have had horns.

The first frogs appeared about 180 million years ago, and their basic body plan has remained unchanged.

The devil frog lived during the Cretaceous Period at the end of the age of dinosaurs, which went extinct along with many other types of animals 65 million years ago.

Earlier studies suggested the creature had a huge, round head as well as sharp teeth and short back legs. But the spiky flanges and plates in its skin were an unexpected discovery.

Scientists suspect the devil frog’s body armour may have been an adaptation to a dry environment allowing it to burrow underground to cool down.

The armour may also have been protection from dinosaurs that roamed the Earth during the same period.

It was powerfully built and possessed a very wide mouth and powerful jaws. It probably didn't dine daintily.

‘It's not outside the realm of possibility that Beelzebufo took down lizards and mammals and smaller frogs, and even - considering its size - possibly hatchling dinosaurs,’ said David Krause of Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York,

When the team looked the frog's body structure, they found that physically, it fit in with a family of horned frogs called the Ceratophryidae, now found only in South America.

However to reach Madagascar from South America, the frogs would have needed to through Antarctica – a route which was submerged underwater by 112 million years ago.

That would mean that devil frogs diverged from their South American relatives before that submergence, pushing back the origin of Ceratophryidae by more than 40 million years.

Researchers collected frog fossil fragments in the Mahajanga Basin in Madagasca. The majority of specimens of Beelzebufo were discovered in the green sections shown on this map
