Arsenal’s talisman forward Alexis Sanchez has taken some time out during the international break to showcase his piano skills.

The Chile international treated his fans on Instagram to a rendition of John Legend’s chart topping ‘All of me’ on the piano.

The 26-year-old is evidently a talented musician, having played the piano for his team-mates at the Arsenal Christmas party earlier this season.

Gunners team-mate Lukas Podolski, on loan at Inter Milan, posted a video with Sanchez performing Richard Marx's 'Right Here Waiting' back in December and he's clearly been practising since.

Sanchez is now on international duty with his homeland Chile, who play Iran in St. Polten on Thursday and Brazil in London on Sunday.

The rapid forward has been a sensation for Arsenal this season, since signing from Barcelona last summer, and has instantly adapted to life in the Premier League with 19 goals.
