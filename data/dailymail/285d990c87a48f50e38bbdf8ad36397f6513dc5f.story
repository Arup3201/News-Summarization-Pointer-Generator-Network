From composing a tactful message to crying into tissues, breaking up is hard to do.

But it appears that there are popular times of year to ditch a partner and, surprisingly, just after Valentine’s Day is one of them.

A significant number of people also call time on their relationship just before Christmas – perhaps to avoid buying their significant other a lavish present.

It's me not you: Two weeks before Christmas and a short time after Valentine's Day are popular times of year to ditch a partner, based on Facebook status updates, according to an infographic (pictured) created by David McCandless and Lee Byron

One in six Americans have dumped someone - or had someone dump them - by text message, email, or through social networks, a recent study revealed.

People aged between 18 and 29 are the most likely to break up via text or email.

A total of 16% of 30 to 49-year-olds have sent a message and 7% of over 50s.

The trend has been linked to the rising popularity of online dating sites.

The findings are shown in an infographic created by London-based data journalist David McCandless and Lee Byron for a book called The Visual Miscellaneum and is based upon the analysis of Facebook updates.

It shows that the most popular time to break up is shortly after Valentine’s Day, when people appear to be spring cleaning their lives as well as their homes.

A smaller peak occurs on April Fools day and curiously more people seem to break up on Mondays in April and early May than on other days.

Not so merry Christmas: Plenty of people also call time on their relationship a couple of weeks before Christmas - perhaps to avoid buying their significant other a lavish present. However, very few people are dumped on Christmas Day, which is considered 'too cruel'

The infographic, posted on the blog Information is Beautiful, shows that people are more likely to break up earlier rather than later in the summer and that more couples go their separate ways as the nights draw in and winter approaches.

While the Christmas period is thought to be ‘too cruel’ to dump a partner, two weeks before the big event is the most popular time of all.

A recent study found that young people increasingly choose to dump their partners electronically.

An online relationships report from Pew Research Centre found both sexes are guilty of breaking up with someone online, but women marginally beat men by one per cent.

Ur dumped: A recent study found that young people increasingly choose to dump their partners electronically and that women are marginally more likely to resort to a text message than men

In total, one in six Americans have dumped someone - or had someone dump them - by text message, email, or through social networks.

According to the findings, the most prevalent electronic heartbreakers are aged between 18 and 29 years old at 22 per cent.

However, 16 per cent of 30 to 49-year-olds admitted to resorting to text or email to end a relationship along with seven per cent of over 50s.

The trend has been linked to the rising popularity of online dating sites, which has more than tripled in the past five years.
