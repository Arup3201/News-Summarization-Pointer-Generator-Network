A luxury Beverly Hills villa that was the scene of one of the Beatles most infamous parties has gone on sale - and appeared to have retained its psychedelic ambiance with some seriously retro decor.

The mansion, built in 1949 in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, lists previous owners as Cary Grant and Zsa Zsa Gabor and can be yours for $3.1 million.

The Beatles rented the 4,330 square-foot, Spanish-style house from actress Gabor in 1965 while on their North American Tour for some much-needed privacy and rest.

However after inviting celebrity friends to their hideaway, the band took LSD, embarking on a two-day trip that inspired Lennon and McCartney to write song She Said, She Said.

A long way from Liverpool: The LA mansion, which is on the market for $3.1million, was rented by The Beatles in 1965

Fab life: The Beatles holed up at the mansion for a week, inviting celebrity friends Peter Fonda, Joan Baez and the Byrds to party with them

With four bedrooms, six bathrooms, two wet bars, a wine cellar, hardwood floors, five fireplaces, six car garage, pool - and 2.53 acres - there is plenty of room for rock and roll excess.

The decor - heavily-patterned couches, wooden panels and a faux French chateau vibe - appeared to have had little done to it since the Fab Four paid a visit.

Realtor Roger Perry told MailOnline that the home was put on the market on August 23 by current owner Pamela Juhos. 

The mansion was rented in late August 1965 by the band's manager Brian Epstein to give them a break from touring.

The address of 2850 Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills spread like wildfire among fans and was besieged by devoted followers who blocked roads and tried to climb the steep canyon to reach their idols.

Finding themselves trapped behind the property walls, The Beatles invited famous friends to join them including Eleanor Bron (who co-starred in Help!), Peggy Lipton and folk singer Joan Baez..

Genius: The Beatles 1966 album Revolver

The song She Said, She Said was later described by Lennon as an 'acidy song'.

It has been suggested that he was inspired by comments Fonda made while the band and their guests were sitting in a huge empty bathtub in the master bedroom, high on hallucinogenics.

She Said She Said features on the 1966 Revolver album - added by the band because they were a track short.

Ringo Starr said of the album's recording: 'We
 were having more fun in the studio, from Revolver Rubber Soul as it was
 building up, it was getting more experimental, the songs were getting 
better, more interesting.

'So that’s where we were going.'

Revolver entered the British and U.S. charts at number one, staying there for seven and six weeks respectively.

The band's seventh studio album is considered one of their greatest musical achievements and regularly is included in lists of the best albums of all time.

When asked about the influence of drug-taking on their music, John Lennon told an interviewer in 1972: 'They don't make you write any better. I never wrote any better stuff because I was on acid or not on acid.'

The property is listed on Hauteliving.com, a cluster of some of the most opulent homes on the market around the world.
