A shocked underwater photographer got the shot of a lifetime when a shark swam right up to her and posed in front of her camera.

The friendly tiger shark pressed its nose against Veleria Serna's lens while the photographer was taking part in a deep sea dive in the Bahamas.

Fellow diver Ken Kiefer, from Houston, Texas, captured the moment the curious shark came nose-to-nose with the special underwater equipment.

Coming to see what all the fuss was about: The group of sharks seemed to have no fear of humans and happily swam around the divers' boat

Mr Kiefer, 45, works as a fitness photographer but regularly enjoys deep sea dives with his camera. He was diving with friends off the coast of Tiger Bay when the encounter took place.

He explained how one of the tiger sharks that was swimming nearby came over to the group of divers to find out what they were up to.

'When I dive I'm not scared at any point, but always respectful of them', he explained. 'I choose to only dive with prepared and knowledgeable operators and peers and all precautions are taken to maximise safety.'

No sudden movements: The divers all had to stay very calm when the shark in the pictures was getting close

A different way of communicating: The curious creatures often bump objects with their heads and inspect them with their mouths

Ken continued: 'When the shark in the pictures was getting close we all just stayed calm.

'They are very curious and do not have hands to explore, so there is always a possibility that they might bump and inspect you with their mouths, which is exactly what this one did.

'We used our cameras to prevent the sharks from bumping us with their head.'

'Tiger sharks are extremely curious creatures', he explained.

'I understand why people are scared of sharks but I have never been involved with or witnessed any shark attacking someone.

'It was just such an amazing moment to capture the shark nose to nose with the camera.'
