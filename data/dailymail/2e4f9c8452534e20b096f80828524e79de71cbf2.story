Leicester manager Nigel Pearson feels his side showed they do have what it takes to get the results needed to stay in the Barclays Premier League after coming from behind to dump Tottenham out of the FA Cup at White Hart Lane.

The Foxes, bottom of the top-flight, produced a battling display to stun Spurs with two late goals on Saturday.

Leonardo Ulloa cancelled out a first-half penalty from Spurs midfielder Andros Townsend before Jeff Schlupp stabbed a stoppage-time winner past flapping goalkeeper Michel Vorm to send them into the fifth-round draw.

Pearson believed the result was all the more impressive given the injustice of seeing Andrej Kramaric, the £9million signing making his full debut, booked for diving when he should have been awarded a penalty after being tripped by Vorm.

Leicester, who are three points adrift of safety, travel to Manchester United next weekend, then host rejuvenated Crystal Palace before heading to Arsenal.

Pearson is confident the manner of the victory at White Hart Lane can stand his squad in good stead for the challenges ahead.

'We have found life in the Premier League harder than we would have liked, but the players have shown an awful lot of mental resilience,' he said.

'We have been playing well in a lot of games and not getting the results performances have warranted

'So from being a team which was winning every week last season (in the Championship) to not being able to find the results can be a psychological hurdle to overcome.

'The learning curve of being able to be competitive in the top flight is about being efficient in both boxes and we have not always taken chances when they have come, and we have been punished severely for minor errors.

'But (with victory at Spurs) we have shown we are capable, so it is important we look at what is happening realistically - there is no point going overboard because we have won a cup game, but our performance has been very encouraging.

'We showed resilience and know-how, and created chances.'

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino made no less than nine changes from the side which had started the midweek Capital One Cup semi-final win over Sheffield United.

However, the Argentine coach insists that should not have made a difference as Spurs were made to pay for not killing off Leicester.

Spurs must, though, quickly regroup as they head to Bramall Lane on Wednesday night defending a slender 1-0 lead in the battle to reach Wembley.

'It is important to keep our motivation and confidence, because we need to play on Wednesday with our best performance, it will be a really tough game,' he said.

Vorm, who could yet retain his place in the side next week, admits the manner of the defeat was tough to take, the Dutchman having earlier kept his side in the tie with a couple of fine saves before his untimely gaff allowed Schlupp's shot to roll over the goalline.

'If that (mistake) happens earlier in the game, maybe you can turn it around, but at the end makes it even worse,' Vorm said on Spurs TV.

'When the ball goes in, it is horrible, but that is football.

'I am gutted now, but you have to go on because there is another big game ahead on Wednesday and we have to focus on that as quickly as possible.'
