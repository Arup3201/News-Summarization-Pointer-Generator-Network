Juventus moved closer to a fourth straight Serie A title with a 1-0 win over Genoa on Sunday.

Carlos Tevez scored the only goal of the game after 25 minutes to secure a 20th win in 28 Serie A fixtures for Massimiliano Allegri's men.

Their advantage at the top of the table is now such that they can plan on wrapping the title up even before the semi-finals of the Champions League, which they will reach if they can see off Monaco in the quarters.

Roma kept pace, some 14 points back, as they saw off relegation-battling Cesena 1-0.

Daniele De Rossi got the goal after 41 minutes, his first strike away from home in the league since August 2013.

The victory kept Roma in second place but just one point clear of city rivals Lazio, who clinched their sixth straight victory with a 2-0 triumph over Hellas Verona.

Lazio took the lead when Felipe Anderson scored his ninth goal of the campaign in the fourth minute.

Not long after, Vangelis Moras nearly pulled the visitors level but he was denied by the post.

After Lazio's Lucas Biglia hit the crossbar in the 27th minute, the hosts doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time when Antonio Candreva hit the back of the net with a free-kick

Sampdoria moved up to fourth and piled more pressure on their former hero Roberto Mancini, who saw his Inter Milan side slump to a sixth straight defeat in all competitions and further out of the European race with a 1-0 loss.

A stunning strike from Eder, the Brazilian-born player just called up by Italy, midway through the second half was enough to make it four wins on the bounce for coach Sinisa Mihajlovic - the former Inter player who both played alongside and under Mancini.

His side were deserving winners on the balance of play and the performance will bring more questions for Mancini, with the board demanding European qualification but 10 points separating them from the top five.

Sampdoria, on the other hand, are eyeing the Champions League places after climbing above Napoli, who were held 1-1 by Atalanta.

They needed Duvan Zapata's 89th minute equaliser to even get a point after Mauricio Pinilla's 72nd minute goal for Atalanta, who were reduced to 10 men when Alejandro Gomez was sent off.

Napoli coach Rafael Benitez also saw red, sent to the stands for dissent late on.

Napoli remain a point above Fiorentina, who were held to a 2-2 draw at Udinese.

The hosts took the lead through Molla Wague after 15 minutes, but two goals in four minutes from Mario Gomez early in the second half flipped the match on its head before Panagiotis Kone's 62nd minute leveller.

Torino inflicted more misery on struggling Parma as they claimed a 2-0 win over the bankrupt club.

Maxi Lopez and Migjen Basha scored for Torino while Parma were forced to play more than half of the match with 10 men after defender Alessandro Lucarelli was sent off in the 36th minute for his second bookable offence.

The result saw Torino move up to seventh place while Parma, whose future remains unclear, stayed rock bottom of the overall standings with just nine points.

Empoli climbed above Sassuolo with a 3-1 win at the Stadio Carlo Castellini.

Riccardo Saponara was on target twice with Levan Mchedlidze netting the Tuscan side's other goal.

An own goal from Daniele Rugani brought Sassuolo level just after half-time but it was not enough to prevent them from falling to their fifth defeat in their last six games.
