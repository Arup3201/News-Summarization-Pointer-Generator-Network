Attackers targeted British tourists in Kenya in a grenade attack in Kenya this morning, but the explosive failed to explode.

The assailants quickly fled after hurling the grenade at a minibus carrying the tourists as it drove through the Likoni district of Mombasa, Kenya's main port city.

The grenade struck the vehicle's window but bounced off before landing on the ground without exploding, in a rare attack specifically targeting travellers in Kenya.

The tourists had been travelling by 
road from the Indian Ocean coastal resort of Diani to Mombasa, a mainly 
Muslim region whose white-sand beaches are popular with tourists but 
which is troubled by religious tensions.

Robert Kitur, the city's police chief, said: 'The grenade was detonated safely by experts.

'We are investigating the incident and looking for the man who threw the grenade at the tourists and fled.'

The Foreign Office said it was 
urgently looking into the reports that a number of British travellers 
had escaped the attack near Mombasa after the grenade failed to explode.

Police told the Kenyan-based Standard Digital that the van was slowing down as the assailant flung a grenade 
at it. 'He vanished soon after he hurled the explosive,' Chief Kitur 
told Standard Digital.

After the Russian-made explosive 
failed to explode the driver of the minivan sped to a nearby police 
station and reported the attack.

Police subsequently attended the scene, cordoned off the area and detonated the device in a controlled explosion.

The tourists meanwhile continued on 
their way to a wildlife safari at one of Kenya's world famous national 
parks. Tourism is a key multi-million earner of foreign currency for 
Kenya.

The British High Commission in Kenya 
said it was 'aware of a failed grenade attack on a vehicle near 
Mombasa', adding they were 'looking into whether any British nationals 
were involved and stand ready to provide consular assistance if needed'.

The attack came as Kenya celebrates its 50 years of independence from former colonial rulers Britain.

Kenya has seen a wave of grenade 
attacks since its forces invaded southern Somalia in October 2011 to 
help oust Al Qaeda-linked insurgents from the militant group al-Shabaab.

Home-grown groups including the 
Islamist Al-Hijra group, a radical organisation formerly known as the 
Muslim Youth Centre, operate on Kenya's coast and have been linked to 
al-Shabaab.

Several radical Muslim preachers have 
been assassinated in Mombasa sparking riots by their supporters, who 
have accused the police of carrying out the killings, claims they 
strongly deny.

Grenades have been hurled into 
restaurants in Mombasa and crowded areas in the capital Nairobi, as well
as a string of attacks in the remote northeast region bordering 
Somalia.

Al-Shabaab also claimed the brutal 
September assault on Nairobi's upmarket Westgate mall, a centre popular 
with foreigners, in which at least 67 people died in a four-day siege.

However, grenade attacks have in the past rarely targeted tourists.

In September 2011 gunmen killed a 
British man David Tebbutt and kidnapped his wife Judith - who was held 
for six months before being released - while they were on holiday at a 
Kenyan coastal resort close to the Somali border.

Three weeks later, disabled 
Frenchwoman Marie Dedieu was kidnapped from her home on Kenya's Manda 
island and later died in captivity in Somalia.

Police said they had beefed up security.

'We are appealing to everybody to 
exercise caution, especially over this festive season, and to share 
information with security agencies to win the war on terror,' said Mr 
Kitur.

'We have intensified security at tourist hotels and other vital installations to avert terrorism attacks.'
