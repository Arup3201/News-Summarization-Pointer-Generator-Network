Florida citrus growers are battling their biggest threat in history as a disease with the potential to decimate orange crops sweeps the state.

Called citrus greening, the bacterial disease causes the fruits of orange and grapefruit trees to turn bitter and fall uselessly to the ground.

First spotted in 2005, the disease has been spreading ever since and now affects all 32 of the Sunshine State’s citrus-growing counties.

And losses in 2013 have been more extensive than previous years, suggesting the problem is getting worse.

‘(It) represents an existential threat to Florida's signature crop,’ Florida’s agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam told the Wall Street Journal in January.

Since then, the USDA has downgraded its estimates for the year’s crop by more each month.

The epidemic now has growers and lawmakers struggling to find a solution.

Senator Bill Nelson of Florida helped obtain $11 million in federal funds to combat the disease.

'The long and short of it is that the industry that made Florida, that is synonymous with Florida, that is a staple on every American breakfast table, is totally threatened,' the Democrat told the New York Times.

Prior to this year, the industry the state’s industry had already been on the decline for 15 years and efforts to curb losses from greening, according to insiders, have thus far failed.

The problem has been further compounded in 2013 by an unusually dry winter and trees overloaded with fruit.

A 2012 University of Florida study, estimated the disease had cost the state $3.6 in revenue since 2006 as well as 6,600 lost jobs.

But efforts to stop the plague continue. Some focus on the tiny insect, the Asian Citrus Psyllid, that carries the bacteria.

Other efforts seek to treat trees with new antibiotics that combat the bacteria. Scientists are also looking into making new breeds of citrus tree that are more resistant to the disease.

And a ray of hope comes from another, if rather unlikely, place.

The Coca-Cola Company, which produces Minute Maid and the Simply juice brands, said Tuesday that it is spending $2 billion to support the planting of 25,000 acres of new orange groves in Florida.

Some 5 million new trees will be planted in the new groves, believed to be the largest citrus addition in the state for at least 25 years, and officials remain hopeful it is a sign the tides of the state’s citrus industry are changing for the better.
