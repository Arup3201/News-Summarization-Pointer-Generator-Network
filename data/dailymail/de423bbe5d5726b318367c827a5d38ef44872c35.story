A man suspended from a Detroit-area university after writing about his attraction to several of his teachers has lost a $2.2 million lawsuit he had brought against the school, claiming his free-speech rights were violated.

Joseph Corlett, 57, a home builder who enrolled in college because of the weak economy, said he was an A-student in a writing class at Oakland University in Rochester until he submitted a journal in 2011 titled 'Hot For Teacher,' the name of a song by the rock band Van Halen.

Corlett compared his writing instructor Pamela Mitzelfeld to Ginger, a sultry movie starlet character on the 1960s TV show 'Gilligan's Island.'

He described her as 'tall, blonde, stacked,' among other things. He also wrote that he feared being distracted and said, 'I'll never learn a thing.' 

He also described another teacher, who was pregnant, that she was 'hot, and not just from baking the bun in her oven.'

Federal Judge Patrick Duggan dismissed Corlett's lawsuit and said that while his words may be appropriate in a karaoke bar, they don't need to be tolerated by Oakland University.

He says there was no violation of Joseph Corlett's free speech rights.

Teacher Mitzelfeld had drawn an Oakland dean's attention to Corlett's prose after reading his journal for the first time.

Officials said Corlett's writings violated a policy against intimidation or harassment and last year barred him for three terms, through to the winter of 2013.

The university also said he must undergo counseling if he wants to return as a student.

In an interview before the judge's decision, Corlett, who now lives in Sarasota, Florida, said he was fighting for his civil rights.

‘When you get past the titillation, you've got to look into what's really going on here,’ he said. ‘It's academic freedom or no academic freedom. We're all collectively dumbed when speech is suppressed or challenged.’

Corlett said students in the English 380
class were told to write ‘raw things, a personal diary that maybe we 
wouldn't want anyone to read.’ He said the teacher had no objection to 
his earlier work, which earned an A, an essay about accidentally seeing 
women's breasts.

Corlett had titled his essay 'Hot for Teacher' after the 1980s Van Halen song

‘There is no constitutional protection against being offended,’ Corlett said. ‘And while I am sympathetic to anyone's feelings, I repeatedly asked for instruction. I was repeatedly told there were no topics that were out of bounds.’

Corlett was removed from the writing class by two police officers after an Oakland administrator forgot to tell him that he was barred from attending while his status as a student was under review.

He had been seeking $2.2 million for mental anguish and the embarrassment of being kicked out of school.

Corlett enrolled full-time at Oakland in 2011 after earning an associate degree from Oakland Community College.

The journal in which he wrote the piece was labelled as a ‘place for a writer to try out ideas and record impressions and observations’.

The idea was that uncensored writings and
thoughts in the journal, which he handed in November, could be used to 
create proper essays.

Officials at Oakland said Corlett's writings violated a policy against intimidation or harassment and barred him for three terms

He compared one teacher in another entry to Ginger Grant, a character played by actress Tina Louise in 1960s TV comedy series Gilligan's Island.

His wife Lynn has supported him during his lawsuit and his lawyers had claimed that he was been treated like a ‘student with a mental disability’.

Ms Mitzelfeld told university officials that she would leave if they did not ban Mr Corlett from campus, reported the Huffington Post.

She also claimed she was concerned he might be carrying a gun in her classrooms after he allegedly wrote about his support for carrying concealed weapons in previous work.

Oakland University Writing Center director Sherry Wynn Perdue told the Huffington Post that Mr Corlett had ‘victimised’ Ms Mitzelfeld.

Hot for Teacher by Van Halen was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band's album 1984, which courted controversy with its bizarre video.
