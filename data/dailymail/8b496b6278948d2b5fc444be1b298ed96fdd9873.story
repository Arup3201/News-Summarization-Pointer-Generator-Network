A Canadian man is suing a hospital over surgery he claims left his penis one inch shorter - and ruined his marriage.

The unnamed man - who is also paraplegic - was rushed to hospital in 2011 with a fractured appendage.

This was an injury sustained while 
having sex with his wife, according to the lawsuit filed last week.

The Canadian patient had needed surgery after fracturing his penis during sex (file picture)

A fracture can occur when there is 
trauma to the erect penis. If it is bent suddenly or forcefully while 
engorged, the trauma may rupture the lining of one of the two cylinders 
in the penis (corpus cavernosum) responsible for erections.

The injury is often accompanied by an audible cracking sound, then dark bruising as blood escapes from the cylinder.

This patient underwent surgery to try and repair the damage, but this reportedly left a 'permanent scar' on his penis - and reduced its length by 'about 
an inch' (2.5cm).

The man, from Montreal, claims he was unable to have sex for two years and his wife eventually left him.

He is now seeking Can$155,000 ($142,680 / £84,073)
 in damages for negligence and 'indescribable anguish', the Canadian agency QMI reports. 

He told staff there: 'This has caused a greater impact on my life than when I lost the use of my legs.'

The lawsuit claims that after arriving at hospital, a nurse assessed the injury without performing a physical examination.

The patient underwent surgery to try and repair the damage, but this reportedly left a 'permanent scar' on his penis - and reduced its length by 'about an inch' (2.5cm)

An off-site urologist then diagnosed him with 'mild trauma' to the area and he was sent home - again without being examined, it is claimed. 

It was only three months later - when he still couldn't have sex - that he was told he had a fractured penis and would require surgery.

But after the operation, he says he was left with a 'permanent scar' on his manhood.

The lawsuit also claims he had lost 'about an inch' of length - and was unable to have sex for two years, leading to the breakdown of his marriage.
