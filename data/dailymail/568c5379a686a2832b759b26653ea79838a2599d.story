Utilities giant General Electric has been accused of avoiding paying taxes as it was revealed that it is the American company with the most profits kept overseas.

The company said in a February 26 regulatory filing that it was holding $108billion in profits outside of the US at the end of 2012, up from $102billion the previous year.

And, according to analysis of 83 major US firms by Bloomberg, that amount is the highest of any of the biggest firms in America.

General Electric has faced criticism previously for holding profits overseas in a bid to avoid paying tax, with claims made by the New York Times that the firm paid no tax in the US at all in 2010.

Those allegations are 'untrue' company spokesman Seth Martin told the Huffington Post.

The company said that it did not intend to bring the profits back to the US and that most had already been reinvested abroad.

But it is by no means the only company keeping large proportions of its profits overseas.

Further analysis by the Wall Street Journal found that 60 big US firms kept on average more than 40 per cent of their annual profits overseas.

Not only is the US missing out on revenue from taxes by companies keeping profits abroad, the cash will also not be used to invest in US business or payed out to shareholders.

Many companies say that a growing amount of their profits are from increased sales overseas and have set up foreign subsidiary firms.

Some other major firms, including web giant Google, have doubled their profits kept overseas in the past year, according to Bloomberg

It was claimed in a separate Bloomberg report that some US companies have increased their stash of profits by as much of 14 per cent in the last year and some firms including Google, Microsoft and Apple have doubled theirs.

Drug manufacturers Johnson & Johnson and Merck both saved around $2billion by keeping their profits overseas according to Bloomberg.

Many politicians, including Senator Charles Grassley want a crackdown on such practices.

Although General Electric claims that its tax burden was low in 2010 because of huge losses in profits made during the economic downturn, campaign group Citizens for Tax Justice claimed that the company paid an average rate of just 1.8 per cent in tax between 2002 and 2011. 

Its Chief Executive Jeff Immelt described the US tax system as 'old, complex and uncompetitive' and said that it is having a negative effect on the country's economy.
