Pope Francis has warned the European Union that it is seen as ‘aloof’, ‘insensitive’, 'if not downright harmful’ by those it seeks to represent, who resent its bureaucracy and the creeping expansion of its powers.

Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the pope said there was ‘growing mistrust’ by Europeans citizens at the expansion of the EU.

He said the ‘great ideas’, which once moved Europeans to unite seem to have lost their appeal, only to be replaced by the ‘bureaucratic technicalities of its institutions’.

Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the pope said there was ‘growing mistrust’ by Europeans citizens at the expansion of the EU

He said that Europe is seen as an 'aged' and 'haggard' ‘grandmother’ by the rest of the planet and felt 'less and less a protagonist', in a world that regarded it 'with detachment, diffidence and even suspicion'.

The speech drew repeated applause from MEPs but Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission’s new president, and Martin Schulz, the parliament’s socialist president, were less than impressed.

The pair looked uncomfortable when the pope denounced the organisation’s promotion of a 'rather selfish lifestyle marked by an opulence that is no longer sustainable and which is frequently indifferent to the world around us'. 

Francis said: 'In recent years, as the European Union has expanded, there has been growing mistrust on the part of citizens towards institutions considered to be aloof, engaged in laying down rules perceived as insensitive to individual peoples, if not downright harmful.'

He added: 'In many quarters we encounter a general impression of weariness and ageing, of a Europe which is now a “grandmother”, no longer fertile and vibrant.'

The pope has previously called Europe 'a tired continent'.

Francis also used his visit, his first to France, to call for a ‘united response’ to boatloads of poor and desperate migrants arriving in Europe, saying that we cannot allow the Mediterranean ‘to become a vast cemetery’.

He said:‘The boats landing daily on the shores of Europe are filled with men and women who need acceptance and assistance.'

Francis condemned the scaling back of the Mediterranean migrant rescue mission last month. A new mission by EU border agency Frontex has taken over the Italian Navy rescue efforts this month but has just one third of the funding and will patrol only in EU waters.

Francis condemned an ‘absence of mutual support’ from EU states saying it would ‘contribute to slave labour and continuing social tensions’.

Each person was entitled to the 'dignity' of work and food, he said.

The pope urged the parliamentarians to confront immigration problems only by adopting ‘fair, courageous and realistic policies’ rather than those motivated by self-interest.

Francis' visit to Strasbourg has annoyed some who have accused him of neglecting Europe since his election last year. It is only his second European trip after Albania.
