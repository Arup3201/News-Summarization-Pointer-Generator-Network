Pensioners in Britain are more likely to die of flu or pneumonia than anywhere else in Europe, a damning Brussels report has revealed.

Official figures show more than 80 Britons die from the diseases every day – 70 per cent higher than the European average.

Overall, some 138 people in every 100,000 in the UK die from ‘respiratory diseases’ – including influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma – every three years. This works out at 88,000 people – or 29,000 a year.

Britain has the worst record in Europe for deaths from respiratory diseases like flu and pneumonia

Nine out of 10 people who die from flu and other respiratory diseases are over 65, according to the EU report – suggesting some 26,000 British pensioners die from the preventable diseases every year.

The EU said poor public health campaigns warning the elderly to get vaccinated against flu was to blame for countries suffering high death rates.

In 2011 the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley scrapped the annual flu vaccination advertising campaign to encourage pensioners to get the jab. After a spike in deaths the Department of Health u-turned – reintroducing the yearly campaign.

Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: ‘These figures are deeply worrying and shows us just how far there is to go to get care right for older people with poor respiratory health or at high risk from infections such as the flu.

‘It is vital we ensure the health service is geared up to meet the needs of frail older people and those living with long term conditions and help them stay as well as possible especially as winter approaches.’

Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s Shadow Health Minister, said old age deaths because they could not afford to heat their homes was a national scandal.

Heat your home to at least 18C

If heating the whole house is a problem heat the living room during the day and your bedroom just before you go to sleep

Have your flu jab to protect yourself  from influenza

Look out for friends, relatives and neighbours who may be vulnerable to the cold

Watch the weather forecast and plan ahead

Have regular hot meals and drinks

Get financial support to make your home more energy efficient

Have your heating and cooking appliances checked regularly

Wear a few layers of thin clothing rather than one thick layer

When you need to go outside wear shoes with slip resistant, good grip soles

Mr Gwynne said: ‘Older people living in cold homes is a scandal and we must put an end to it.

‘Labour's promise to stand up to the energy companies and freeze bills will help to protect older people from poor health.’

Former industrial areas and countries where lots of people smoke are also likely to suffer higher flu and pneumonia death rates.

The Brussels report said men were almost twice as likely to die from the diseases.

Public Health England confirmed that Britain was the worst record for flu and pneumonia in Europe according to Brussels' official figures.

Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at PHE, said: 'Although attempts are made to standardise coding of deaths, it’s important to exercise caution when comparing country to country figures like this, due to systematic differences in the way clinicians complete death certificates.

'While these figures suggest UK has a high rate of respiratory death, it also says UK has one of the lowest rates for circulatory deaths, and it is not possible to conclude from these figures alone that the UK has had a higher burden of disease due to influenza'

The Government was attacked earlier this week over official advice for pensioners to protect against the cold this winter.

The Public Health England document said struggling pensioners should only turn on the heating in one room to stay warm this winter.

The new guidance urges those struggling to pay their heating bills to only warm their living room during the day and their bedroom at night.

A hot water bottle should also be taken to bed, according to Public Health England.

Other 'top tips' to drive down winter deaths include wearing slippers, keeping out the cold with lots of thin layers of clothes – and having regular hot meals and cups of tea throughout the day.

According to the report the elderly should heat their homes to at least 18C during the winter to protect their health.

Last year's cold weather saw 31,100 excess deaths in Britain, mainly among over–75s.

Dot Gibson, National Pensioners' Convention general secretary, said: 'Every year, we get the same sort of message from public health officials. But the number of older people dying from cold–related illnesses is on the rise.

'Putting on an extra jumper or walking around a bit more than usual doesn't really address the fact that fuel bills continue to go up way in excess of people's pensions.

'Warm words are nice – but a warm home is better.'

The average household energy bill is now £1,265 a year, £53 more than a year ago.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, added: 'It is shocking that each winter an older person dies every seven minutes from cold weather.

'Turning up the heating is not an option for many older people struggling with high bills.'

But Dr Angie Bone, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at Public Health England, said thousands of lives could be saved if people followed the Government's advice. 

The flu jab is available every year on the NHS to protect adults and some children, at risk.

Flu can be an unpleasant illness. But for those who are otherwise healthy, it usually clears up on its own within a week.

However, for some people the illness can be much more severe, even life-threatening.

Those at risk include:

Anyone in a risk group is likely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia.

The flu vaccine is given free of charge to:

The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November.

For those not deemed at risk, it is possible to pay to have a flu jab. Boots Pharmacies are offering the vaccination in store.

Deepa Songara, Boots flu pharmacist said: 'We spend less time outside and much longer closer together at home or in indoor places. 

'This 'togetherness' makes it easier to pass germs from one person to another so it is important to think ahead and try to protect yourself before the cold and flu season really kicks in. 

'Busy communal places are ideal breeding environments for winter bugs and simple things like washing your hands or using alcohol based hand gel can help keep you well.'
