A panicked father had to resuscitate his new born son when he momentarily stopped breathing after delivering him in a car at the side of the road... just minutes from a community hospital.

Despite pleading with a 999 operator for help, Craig Baker, 25, was told 'nobody' at the hospital could come to his aid as his new baby struggled to breathe.

Mr Baker was driving his partner Gemma Fraser, 23, to Hull Royal Infirmary after she went into labour with her second child Nathan.

Craig Baker was forced to give newborn son Nathan, mouth-to-mouth after stopping minutes away from a nearby hospital. He was forced to deliver the baby, pictured with mother Gemma Fraser and sister Phoebe

But by the time the pair, from Kilham in East Yorkshire, reached nearby Beverley, the baby had almost arrived.

Mr Baker was left with no choice but to pull over and call an ambulance and begin to deliver the baby himself - despite being painstakingly close to another hospital, East Riding Community Hospital.

The panicked father assumed someone from the hospital could come to the family's aid.

The 999 operator told Mr Baker she would call the hospital for help.

But when she came back on the line, the woman told terrified Mr Baker: 'Nobody can help you.'

Parked less than five minutes walk from the hospital, Mr Baker was forced to deliver his son in the front passenger seat of their Ford Focus.

As little Nathan, who weighed 9lb 4oz, arrived his father feared he had stopped breathing so administered life-saving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

He said it is 'disgusting' that staff at the nearby hospital - which does not have a maternity department - failed to come to his family's aid.

Mr Baker said: 'I delivered the baby while I was on the phone to the ambulance lady.

'She said she would ring through to the Community Hospital in Beverley but she came back on and said "nobody can help you".

'It’s disgusting, really - it didn’t have to be a midwife, a doctor could have come out or just anybody with some towels, they would have known more than me - but nothing.

'I had to give him mouth-to-mouth, he was moving his hands and then he just froze.

'I was panicking and the lady on the phone talked me through what to do. He started crying and then he stopped. I had to do it again.

'It was all very scary. It’s not something you can prepare yourself for.'

Nathan was born at 3.28pm on September 24 - six minutes before an ambulance arrived.

He was taken with his parents by ambulance to Hull Royal Infirmary and is now back at home with his older sisters, Phoebe, two and Izzy, five.

Miss Fraser said: 'He was four days late. We rang the hospital at 12.45pm and they told me to take two paracetemol and have a hot bath and ring back in an hour.

'Twenty minutes later I had four contractions in five minutes. I rang back and they told me to go through.'

Services at Beverley Community Hospital are provided by Humber NHS Foundation Trust and Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust.

A spokeswoman at Humber NHS Foundation Trust said: 'None of our staff based at East Riding Community Hospital were contacted. As a trust we do not provide midwifery services.'

Ben Holdaway, Locality Director of Emergency Operations Centre at Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'Staff in our Emergency Operations Centres are trained to give advice and instruction to callers so that immediate care can be provided until the ambulance crew arrives.

'Patients are advised to stay in the location they are calling from to ensure that our staff can find them as quickly as possible.

'On behalf of the Trust I would like to offer our congratulations to the family on their new arrival.'
