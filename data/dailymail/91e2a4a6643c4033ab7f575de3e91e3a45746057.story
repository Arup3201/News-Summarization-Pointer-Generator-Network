Despite not having appeared on the big screen for over ten years, Sir Sean Connery is the most popular British actor among American film fans, it has emerged.

The James Bond star was listed as the most recognisable and well-liked actor in a recent US survey which measures the public's opinion of celebrities.

The Q score charts, which are carried out every six months among 1,500 people by the New York based Q Scores Company, has released its first 'Brit Q' rankings in which the 83-year-old actor triumphed.

Pictured as James Bond in 1962, Scottish actor Sir Sean Connery was named as the most popular British film star in the American poll

Other British stars to make the list of favourites were Sir Anthony Hopkins, 74, and Liam Neeson, 61.

The figures, which were first compiled in 1998, show how the Scottish actor was temporarily knocked off the top spot in 2008 by House star, Hugh Laurie. 

Like others on the list, Laurie's popularity took a dive after his departure from the US television programme.

Dame Judi Dench placed sixth while Daniel Craig, who appeared alongside her in the most recent James Bond films, came eighth.

The Bond star, who is now 83, is considered a favourite as 'young men still want to be him' according to The Q Scores executive vice-president

Downton Abbey stars Dame Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton both appeared the chart as well as younger celebrities such as Kate Beckinsale, Lucy Punch and Carey Mulligan.

Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe ranked at 20, while Twighlight heart-throb Robert Pattinson came 47th.

The number of names on the Q Score lists vary from just 28 in 1998 to 46 in 2003, and 41 in 2008. 

While more seasoned actors topped the 
1998 charts, younger stars started to appear in 2003 with Catherine 
Zeta-Jones, Orlando Bloom and Alex Kingston making the cut.

Dame Judi Dench and Daniel Craig also appeared in the list's top ten after starring alongside each other in more recent James Bond films

While Keira Knightley, Michelle Ryan and former EastEnders actress Saffron Burrows all featured on the 2008 chart, only Ms Knightley remained in the 2013 list. 

Henry Schafer, executive vice-president at the Q Scores Company, said: 'Awareness of Sean Connery and his appeal was strong across the country and with all ages.

'He had already transcended the normal run of actors in the way people felt about him.'

Mr Schafer told the Sunday Times: 'British men have become more dominant over the past 15 years as they appear in more Americanmovie and TV roles as well as the awards season.'
