Tonight saw Robert Pattinson make his first public appearance since news broke of his girlfriend Kristen Stewart’s affair with the married director of her movie Snow White and the Huntsman, Rupert Sanders.

The actor earlier today taped an appearance on The Daily Show which aired tonight and was his first interview since the scandal kicked off almost three weeks ago.

He then headed to the New York premiere of his latest movie Cosmopolis, hitting the red carpet.

Brave face: Robert Pattinson made his first public appearance since Kristen Stewart's cheating scandal tonight at the Cosmopolis premiere

The Twilight star put his acting skills to use and managed a faint smile, as he put on his best brave face for photographers.

But despite his attempt at a sunny disposition Pattinson’s eyes told a different story and it seems the star is still understandably heartbroken about the recent events.

Pattinson also made sure he looked his best for his first outing since learning of his long-term girlfriend’s philandering with the father-of-two - which came after intimate photographs of the pair were published in a US tabloid.

Flanked by bodyguards, Robert's hair 
was well-styled and he looked dapper in a cornflower blue Gucci suit 
with a navy shirt and black tie.

He seems to be easing himself gently back into the public eye ahead of his film’s opening on Friday.

Pattinson strictly avoided talking about his personal life on the red carpet but told the New York Daily News of himself: 'I knew [Cosmopolis] would be different, but I didn't have anything to be scared of except failing.'

Meanwhile the film's director David Cronenberg brushed off the scandal and said: 'It doesn’t touch me and it doesn't touch the film.'

Reclusive: Robert has stayed well away from the spotlight and has not been pictured for the last three weeks

And the hunky actor wouldn’t have been worrying about any run-ins with Stewart tonight.

It
was reported earlier this month that she was apparently banned from 
attending the premiere, with security allegedly under instruction to 
keep her away.

His 
appearance on The Daily Show was his first interview since the drama 
unfolded but Pattinson managed to dodge questions about Stewart as he 
chomped on ice cream.

However he couldn't suppress a giggle when host Jon Stewart said: 'Boy, you are better off without... so kick her to the curb!'

Raising a smile: Robert managed a grin when he posed for photos with David Cronenberg and Sarah Gadon

Back in business: Robert worked the red carpet like a pro and chatted to press upon his arrival

And breathe: Once he stepped onto the red carpet Robert seemed to visibly relax

Aside from the nervous laughter, the actor deflected all questions regarding his girlfriend, but did say: 'This is the weird things about these interviews, and now 
I'm going to sound like an idiot, but my biggest problem in my life is 
that I'm cheap.

'I didn't hire a publicist and every awkward interview, most actors have things scripted. I'm going to hire a publicist.'

An audience member had alleged to Life 
& Style that when Jon Stewart claimed 'the world has ended', 
Pattinson said: 'It has'.

He reportedly then laughed nervously and said: 'That was my attempt at a joke.'

Working the crowd: Not even a broken heart could get in the way of Robert's professionalism

A touch of glamour: Zoe Lister-Jones (L) and Nicole Lapin brought some sex appeal to the red carpet

Cosmopolis, based on the 2003 novel of 
the same name by Don DeLillo, is directed by David Cronenberg and also 
stars Juliette Binoche and Sarah Gadon.

It initially premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May, drawing mixed early reactions from critics.

The
drama already had a limited release in the UK on June 15. Pattinson 
plays the lead role of disturbed billionaire Eric Packer.

Cronenberg and Pattinson are also expected at a TimesTalk event on August 15 in the Big Apple to discuss the film.

Robert Pattinson’s TV interview on The Daily Show airs exclusively in the UK tonight on Comedy Central Extra at 10.30pm. (Sky 128/Virgin Media 185)
