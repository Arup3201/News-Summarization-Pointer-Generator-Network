An 85-year-old woman died of a broken heart just days after the death of her husband - who she had been with for 72 years.

Norman and Margaret Balkwill, both 85, both passed away peacefully in hospital - just eight days apart - after spending their whole adult lives together.

The couple, who met at a Christmas party when they were just 13, spent their final moments on different wards at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital.

But Betty was able to be wheeled to her husband’s bedside shortly before he passed away.

Their nephew, Ray Balkwill, of Exmouth, Devon, said: ‘After Norman died, Betty died just eight days later. I think she just pined away without him.

‘They were a wonderful couple who lived for each other.’

Norman and Betty (nee Craker) had met at a festive party 72 years ago and their friendship blossomed throughout their school days in Exeter.

They eventually married on March 26, 1955, in St Michael & All Angels, Alphington.

Norman worked as a butcher and shipping agent while Betty worked in the civil service at the old Army Records Office in Exeter 34 years.

Close friend of the couple Derek Blatchford said: ‘They were a devoted couple. They go on so well.

‘They did not have children - they just needed each other.

Margaret - known as Betty - died just eight days after Norman (pictured together on Hayling Island in 1958)

‘The last two years had been a trial for Betty and she was chair-bound, unable to get about.

‘When she was taken into hospital Norman was unable to cope on his own in the house and he was given respite care.

‘But he got pneumonia and was taken into hospital too. They were in different wards but Betty was brought to his bedside at the end.

‘They will be really missed but I suppose if they had to go this would have been the way they wanted it. They were devoted to each other for so many years.’

The couple will have a joint funeral at Exeter Crematorium on Thursday, February 26.
