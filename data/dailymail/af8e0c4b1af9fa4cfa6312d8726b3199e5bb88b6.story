France's players have arrived at their country's training base in Clairefontaine ahead of two friendlies on home soil over the next eight days.

Stars including Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, Manchester City's Bacary Sagna and Real Madrid star Raphael Varane were pictured joining up with their international team-mates as Didier Deschamps' men continue their preparations for Euro 2016.

As hosts of the tournament in two years' time, France do not have to qualify and are therefore playing two friendly matches with Albania and Sweden during the international break.

Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was also seen arriving, less than 24 hours after Spurs' frustrating home defeat to Stoke in the Premier League. 

Midfielders Mathieu Valbuena and Yohan Cabaye will both hope to be involved, although Deschamps will be without the injured Blaise Matuidi.

The former Juventus and Marseille boss has called up Lyon midfielder Maxime Gonalons to replace Matuidi, who fractured two bones in his right hand playing for Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's 2-0 win over title rivals Marseille. Gonalons last played for France two years ago in a 2-1 win at Italy.

France play Albania in Rennes on Friday before hosting Sweden in Marseille four days later.

Albania are in the same group as France in qualifying for Euro 2016 but their matches don't count for points for either team.
