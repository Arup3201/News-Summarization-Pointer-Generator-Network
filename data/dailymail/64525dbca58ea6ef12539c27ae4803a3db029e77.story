It's been six days since hackers broke into the cloud-based storage systems of more than 100 celebrities and exposed private, mostly-naked pictures of them online.

And finally online noticeboard Reddit have disabled the page that allowed people to view, post and share the images, with at least 400 shots of different actresses and athletes - among them Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, model Kate Upton and reality star Kim Kardashian - said to have hit the internet.

In banning the offending forums, Reddit CEO Yishan Wong suggested the delayed response was a freedom of speech issue, despite the invasions of privacy being lamented as criminal.

Wong described Reddit as 'the government of a new type of community' rather than a company running a website, according to Recode.

Finally banned: Reddit has shut down its online forum The Fappening, which was created to view, post and share leaked naked photos of celebrities. Visitors to the forum are now greeted with this message.

Defensive: Reddit CEO Yishani Wong said the site does not want to impinge on free speech in 
order to compel good behavior, instead expecting users to do the right thing. The site was one of the primary destinations where nude photos of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence (right) were being shared

The headlining forum to be close was called 'The Fappening', which was created solely for the cache of leaked celebrity photos.

'While current US law does not prohibit (Reddit) linking to stolen materials, we deplore the theft of these images and we do not condone their widespread distribution,' Wong wrote in a blog post.

'Nevertheless, reddit’s platform is structurally based on the ability for people to distribute, promote, and highlight textual materials as well as links to images and other media.

'We understand the harm that misusing our site does to the victims of this theft, and we deeply sympathize.'

Wong does not immediately address shutting down The Fappening, however vistors to the site are now greeted with a message from Reddit saying the page has been banned.

Wong went on to essentially say what happens on the site is the responsibility of the user, and not the site itself.

'We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you - the user - has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so.

'When you know something is right, you should choose to do it.

'But as much as possible, we will not force you to do it.'

Wong also made clear in his statement that Reddit does not plan to change its policies because of this incident.

According to Business Insider, those is charge of moderating that material circulating on The Fappening started were sent into a spin after it was revealed the nudes of Olympic athlete McKayla Maroney were taken when she was underage.

Sharing such photos would be considered child pornography.

'Fap' is a slang term used in online communities for masturbating.

Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which also owns Vogue publisher Condé Nast.

Inappropriate: Some of the leaked nude photos being shared were reportedly of underage Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney, which would have been classified as child pornography

Along with Reddit, the images were said to be swirling around influential internet ‘image board’ called 4chan, which attracts 12 million visitors a month.

The site is used principally by young men, who are guaranteed anonymity, as users don’t have to register before posting messages.

4chan was created 15-year-old schoolboy Christopher Poole, who developed the site in his New York bedroom in 2003.
