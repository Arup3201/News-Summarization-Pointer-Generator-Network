MailOnline's brilliant Fantasy Football game made its return at the weekend as the Barclays Premier League season got underway with sensational goals and dramatic games.

And now you can manage your dream team on the go with our new Android mobile app.

So if you've ever been out and about as the goals fly in and wanted to make those vital amendments to your team, now you can.

Easier than ever: Making changes to your dream team just became a lot simpler with the new Android app

All change: If you want to sub in Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, you can now do it anywhere on your phone 

The simple-to-use free app, available now from the Android store, will enhance the whole Fantasy Football experience and make managing your team so much easier.

And an app specially made for iPhone users is coming soon.

Thousands of you have already signed up for our Fantasy game, which has a pot of £60,000 in cash prizes this season.

The jackpot at the end of the season is £10,000 for the winning manager, plus there's a weekly £1,000 'Grand Master' prize for the best-performing boss for each round of matches.

Kevin Brown from Ashford in Middlesex, the manager of 'To Hull and Back', pocketed the first of these prizes after amassing a whopping 231 points - thanks in no small part to using all 16 of his transfers.

So if you haven't already, pick your dream team today. And if you have, get the new apps to make managing your team easy.
