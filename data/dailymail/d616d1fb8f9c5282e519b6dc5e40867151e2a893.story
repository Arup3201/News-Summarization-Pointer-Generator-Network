He's known as one of the most tricky wingers in world football.

His silky skills caused him to become the player fouled most frequently in La Liga this season, as defenders were forced to hack him down once every 22 minutes to nullify his threat.

But Neymar, the man who carries the hopes of the World Cup hosts on his shoulders and who has left countless opponents red-faced over his short career, has been shown up by a football freestyler.

Red-faced: Brazilian superstar Neymar faced football freestyle champion Sean Garnier...

... and got a taste of his own medicine after being nutmegged by the Frenchman

At a Castrol Freestyle Event Brazil's No 10 was nutmegged by two-time World Freestyle Football champion Sean Garnier.

Neymar knew what was coming but was powerless to stop the Frenchman as he bamboozled him taking it round the back of Neymar and through his legs.

After high-fiving Garnier for the trick, Neymar told FIFA.com: 'He is very fast and talented with the ball. He has huge talent for doing tricks.'

Garnier added: 'It's a great feeling. I enjoyed tricking one of the worldâ€™s most technical footballers.'

Good humour: The Barca winger took being shown up well

Congratulations: Neymar high-fived Garnier and said he had 'huge talent'

Broad shoulders: Neymar is carrying the hopes of all of Brazil at the World Cup
