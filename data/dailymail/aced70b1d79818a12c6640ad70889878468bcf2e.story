When it comes to the delicate subject of personal health, it seems British women are burying their heads in the sand.

For they are more likely to rate themselves as fit and healthy than women in almost all other European countries – despite the fact they tend to suffer worse health.

Indeed British women have a shorter life expectancy than many of their European counterparts, are more likely to die from cancer, drink too much and be obese.

In denial? More than 75 per cent of British women rate themselves as fit and healthy, statistics have revealed

According to figures from the EU’s statistics arm Eurostat, 76.5 per cent of women in the UK rated their health as good or very good.

It put UK women in third place behind Ireland, where 83.1 per cent of women rated their health highly and Sweden on 78 per cent.

In Germany only 63.3 per cent of women thought their health was good, and in France 64.4 per cent.

Both countries registered scores below the EU average of 65.3 per cent and – surprisingly – below that of some of the poorest EU countries. In Romania, 64.7 per cent of women rated their health as good or very good, and in Malta 68.8 per cent.

British men, however, were less optimistic than women.

In Sweden, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Greece and Ireland, men reckoned themselves healthier than British men did.

The results were drawn up from surveys carried out in the 28 EU member countries, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.

Swiss women considered themselves healthier than their British counterparts, while men in both Iceland and Switzerland gave themselves higher marks than British men.

The figures come after several studies have raised concerns about the health of women living in the UK. 

A recent study by the World Health Organisation and researchers from University College London found life expectancy among British women is two years shorter than in France, Spain and Italy, and a year shorter than in Cyprus, Malta and Andorra.

It also suggested that 23 per cent of British women are overweight – double the European average.Breast cancer survival rates in the UK are among the lowest in the industrialised world, while cervical cancer survival rates are better in Slovenia and the Czech Republic than in Britain.

Unhealthy: A recent study has suggested that 23 per cent of British women are overweight, while binge drinking among females has more than doubled in the past decade

Binge drinking among women more than doubled during the last decade, and just last month a survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found heavier drinking among 15-year-old British girls here than in any developed country except Denmark.

Eurostat said their table ‘gives an overall assessment by the respondent of his or her health in general.

It added that the survey is carried out only among households, and not in care homes or hospitals, which ‘is likely to contribute to an under-estimation of health problems’.
