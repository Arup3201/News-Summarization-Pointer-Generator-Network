Prince Charles is famous for embracing all manner of exotic outfits on his trips abroad.

But he is evidently more than happy to do the same at home, judging by his appearance in the gardens of Clarence House last night.

Both he and the Duchess of Cornwall sported animal masks at a ball they threw in support of conservation charity the Elephant Family, with guests including models Cara Delevingne and Jerry Hall.

Camilla kept strictly to the theme in a sparkling elephant mask, while Charles opted for a golden design featuring a prancing tiger.

At first the prince struggled to see under his mask, laughing: ‘I am slightly anxious about this thing, I can’t see a thing.’

Camilla, who had been spotted peeking from an upstairs window at the royal residence earlier, told the Daily Mail: ‘When you look from above it looks rather like a mad Ascot!’

She may have wished she had her mask on when she bumped into Miss Delevingne, 20.

Camilla could not help but stare at the model’s black evening dress, which was cut away at the sides to leave very little to the imagination. 

Miss Delevingne was joined by her elder sister Poppy, 26, also a successful model, at the gardens of Charles’s official London residence for the reception. 

The charity was founded by the duchess’s brother, Mark Shand, and is Britain’s biggest funder of the endangered Asian elephant.

The royal couple spent about an hour chatting to some of their 400 guests, who sported a variety of extravagant headdresses at the masked ball. 

Naturally there were elephants but also golden rhinos, flamingos, peacocks and even a pouncing cheetah.

Celebrity photographer Mario Testino, who was wearing a feather Mohawk he had designed himself, said he would love to photograph the new royal baby if asked.

‘I would be honoured to be commissioned,’ he said. 

Miss Hall was also keen to talk about the new addition to the royal family, urging the couple to go for ‘traditional names’ and pointing out she named her own daughter Elizabeth.

Afterwards the gathering moved next door to Lancaster House for a fundraising Animal Ball in aid of the Elephant Family, while Charles and Camilla retired upstairs.

Prince William plans to play in a charity polo match on Sunday, scotching rumours of an early arrival for the royal baby.

But he will not be accompanied to the Jerudong Trophy at Cirencester Park Polo Club by his wife, who will stay in her London ‘safety zone’ so close to her due date.

Kate let slip earlier this year that her baby was due in mid-July.

But in recent weeks there has been speculation that the public had been misled and the baby was due earlier, although this was strongly denied.
