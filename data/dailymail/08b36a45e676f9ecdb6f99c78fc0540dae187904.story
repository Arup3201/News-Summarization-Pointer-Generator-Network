Cardinal Keith O'Brien has resigned as Archbishop of St Andrew's and Edinburgh over the allegations. One of his accusers says the church would 'crush' him, given the opportunity

Church leaders are debating whether to allow Britain’s most senior Roman Catholic clergyman to take part in the vote to choose a new pope after he was accused of ‘inappropriate behaviour’ towards young priests 30 years ago.

Vatican officials last night admitted they were aware of the accusations against Cardinal Keith O’Brien and that the final decision was ‘in the Pope’s hands’.

Cardinal O’Brien, head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and Britain’s only representative at the election of  the next Pope, missed a morning Mass in Edinburgh at which he was due to celebrate the Pope’s eight-year tenure. He denies all the allegations.

It is understood the complaints by  three serving priests and a former priest were reported to the Vatican through the papal ambassador to Britain a week before the Pope’s announcement that he was to step down.

The complainants – all associated with the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh – are said to have told Apostolic Nuncio Antonio Mennini they want Cardinal O’Brien to resign before next month’s conclave to pick a new pontiff.

The 74-year-old, who is due to retire next month, will be the only British churchman eligible to vote.

The former priest claims the cardinal made an inappropriate approach to him in 1980 after night prayers, when he was a seminarian at St Andrew’s College in Drygrange, Roxburghshire, where the cardinal was spiritual director.

The complainant, who is now married, is reported to have said he gave up the priesthood when Cardinal O’Brien was first made a bishop.

He said: ‘I knew then he would always have power over me. It was assumed I left the priesthood to get married. I did not. I left to preserve my integrity.’

Saying mass in Edinburgh: Cardinal Keith O' Brien in his role as Britain's most senior Catholic

In March 2012 O'Brien wrote of his concerns over same-sex marriage in Scotland in The Daily Telegraph.

He said the proposal represents a 'grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right'.

'Same-sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child,' he added.

'It would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father.'

He also opposed the introduction of civil partnerships, saying he believes that 'such relationships are harmful to the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of those involved'.

After he was awarded the 'Bigot of the Year' award, Stonewall Scotland director Colin Macfarlane said: 'In the past year the cardinal has likened the campaign for same-sex marriage to slavery, he has called it grotesque.'

The second complainant is reported to
 have said he was living in a parish when he was visited by Cardinal 
O’Brien, and ‘inappropriate contact’ took place.

The third complainant is said to have
 alleged ‘unwanted behaviour’ by the cardinal in the 1980s after they 
shared a late-night drinking session.

And the fourth reportedly claims the cardinal used night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact.

Cardinal O’Brien was supported yesterday by Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, a former Archbishop of Westminster.

Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor said: ‘I was
 obviously very sad, but the cardinal has denied the allegations, so I 
think we will just have to see how that pans out.’

Asked whether or not Cardinal O’Brien
 should be able to take part in the selection of the new Pope, he added:
 ‘The allegations have not been proved so he will have to decide whether
 he wants to go.’ Allegations against members of the Church have dogged 
the papacy of Benedict XVI and some in the Vatican believe the endless 
scandals prompted him to resign.

Whether or not Cardinal O’Brien will 
be welcomed to the conclave is in the balance even though, according to 
canon law, no cardinal eligible to vote can technically be prevented 
from doing so.

Retiring: Pope Benedict XVI delivers his blessing during his last Angelus noon prayer from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square at the Vatican yesterday

There was outcry last week  when it 
emerged that the disgraced Archbishop of Los Angeles, Roger Mahony, 
would participate in  the conclave, despite shielding accused priests 
from prosecution.

The Pope told 150,000 pilgrims yesterday he is stepping aside because God told him to.

At his last Sunday appearance in the Vatican’s St Peter’s Square Pope 
Benedict XVI revealed God had called on him to devote himself to prayer 
and ‘climb the mountain’.

Benedict, who steps down  on Thursday, said he was ‘not  abandoning the 
church’ but aims to serve with the same dedication ‘in a way more 
suitable to my age and my strength’.
