Charged: David Gherity, 60, has been charged with first-degree assault after lighting his longterm girlfriend on fire in his condominium

A suspended lawyer with a history of abusive behavior has been arrested for dousing his longterm girlfriend with nail polish remover and hair spray before setting her on fire.

David Gherity, 60, has been charged with first-degree assault after the attack that left his girlfriend without an ear and burns all over her body.

The victim- who had burns on her legs, scalp and face- has not been named and was the one to identify Gherity as her attacker.

The Star Tribune reports that the fire alarm went off at Gherity's Burnsville, Minnesota condo on February 9 and the emergency responders saw the victim 'on fire sitting at a table'.

They were able to control the blaze and rushed the woman to a nearby hospital.

'The b****** tried to burn my house down,' she reportedly told one of the firemen during the rescue.

Police began to suspect Gherity when he arrived at the hospital smelling of smoke. When they asked if he had been present at the scene, he told them that he had arrived there later and not been caught in the blaze.

Two weeks later, police spoke to the victim's sister who said that she had received a hushed voicemail from her sister on the day of the attack saying Gherity 'has gone berserk. I can't talk right now. I'll call you later.'

The couple had been together for about 10 years at the time of the February attack.

Legal past: Gherity, seen in an undated photo, was disciplined four times after he passed the Minnesota bar in 1982 and was charged in 2001 for assault after attacking his then-girlfriend

The victim's condition immediately after that accident was not instantly clear, but The Star Tribune reported that she spoke to police on March 4 and said that he was stressed on the day of the fire.

The last thing she remembered was drinking and taking undisclosed medication before falling asleep on the couch.

She then woke up during the fire.

Emergency responders found alcohol bottles near her body when they arrived, and other bottles that they said could have contained nail polish remover and hair spray in the vicinity.

Gherity told the victim's sister that maybe the hairspray and nail polish she uses caught on fire, but the victim later told police that she does not use either product.

Gherity had four earlier disciplinary incidents since passing the Minnesota bar in 1982 and was convicted of assault in 2001. He has been suspended since 2004 as a result of that brutal attack.

Living in the past: Gherity posted this photo of his bar identification card in March 2013- nine years after his legal license was suspended

Reports by the Office of Lawyer's Professional Responsibility describes how he was convicted of fifth-degree assault and disorderly conduct in late 2000, which led to the 2001 arrest.

'The convictions, which were affirmed by the court of appeals, arose from an incident on October 29, 2000 in which Gherity assaulted his girlfriend by repeatedly kicking her in the hallway outside of her 26th floor apartment and when a neighbor attempted to intervene, Gherity also assaulted the neighbor by chasing him to the 26th floor balcony, forcing him against the railing with his hands around his throat, and then repeatedly punching him,' the report reads. â€‚

The girlfriend involved in the 2000 assault was not identified, but given the timeline, it does not seem likely that it was the same woman from this year's attack.
