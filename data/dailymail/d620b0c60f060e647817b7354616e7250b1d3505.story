Desperate: Marilyn Barnes, pictured outside court today wanted to sell her home in Arnside, Cumbria

Prospective buyers were lured in with an enticing description of the Lake District views from the property when it appeared on the market.

What they were not told was that the vistas should never have existed in the first place.

For the property’s owner illegally felled dozens of protected trees in an attempt to increase its value by creating the views.

Marilyn Barnes, 61, was fined £15,000 after a court was told she arranged for the trees facing her home to be chopped down in a desperate attempt to command a higher selling price.

The divorcee had included information about a tree preservation order affecting a small area of land included in the sale when the house first appeared on the market.

But after failing to attract a buyer, the four-bedroom semi-detached house overlooking the Arnside Estuary in Cumbria was remarketed a year later. This time, the details mentioned ‘fine distant views’ and the asking price rose from £399,000 to £425,000.

South Cumbria Magistrates’ Court heard Barnes was no longer able to afford the home after being forced to give up work in 2010 when she fell off ladders while painting a ceiling.

Facing mounting debts, she approached local pig farmer and joiner Stephen Lawton to cut down the trees, telling him she wanted to ‘open up views’.

Lawton felled 27 trees, including ash, hazel, elm, sycamore, holly, beech and willow. He was not paid but used the trees as firewood.

John Batty, for Barnes, said she was ‘extremely embarrassed’ and that it was a big mistake that ‘should never have happened’.

South Lakes District Council, which managed the protection order for the trees, said the property was originally put on sale in October 2013 before being remarketed in November 2014.

Nicola Hartley, for the council, said: ‘It is the prosecution case that the unlawful felling has opened up the view and this has the potential to increase the saleability of the property.

‘The court must have regard to any financial benefit that has been accrued or likely to accrue as a consequence of the offence.’

Barnes, who pleaded guilty to breaching the protection order, was fined £15,000 and ordered to pay £1,260 in court costs and a £120 victim surcharge.

She is understood to have moved out of the property, although a selling price has yet to be listed with the Land Registry.

Lawton, 25, was fined £3,000 and told to pay the same costs as Barnes.

After the case, Miss Hartley said the unlawful felling of such a large number of trees had a significant detrimental impact on the environment, particularly in the loss of habitat for birds and other wildlife.
