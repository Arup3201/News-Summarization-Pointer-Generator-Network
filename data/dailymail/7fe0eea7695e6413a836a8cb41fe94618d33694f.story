Art critic Brian Sewell has revealed how he helped hide traitor Anthony Blunt after the surveyor of the Queen's pictures was publicly unmasked as a Soviet spy.

Blunt told Sewell he was the fourth man in the Cambridge spy ring soon after confessing to MI5 interrogators in 1964.

But, as he reveals in his memoir, Sewell spirited his friend away from the glare of the media after Margaret Thatcher publicly named him 15 years later in the Commons.

Advisor: Anthony Blunt with the Queen during her visit to the Courtauld Institute of Art where he was a director

Blunt's friend: Art critic Brian Sewell helped the traitor when he was exposed in the Commons

They became friends and confidantes in the 1950s  when Sewell studied under Blunt at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.

Stripped of his knighthood: Anthony Blunt

Blunt had denied he fed secrets to the Soviets while working for the security services during World War II, when quizzed 11 times by MI5.

But when they finally forced him to confess, he later told Sewell he was part of a network recruited in the thirties, which included Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean.

Sewell claimed the Queen knew of Blunt's spying and kept him in his post for another decade before Blunt retired in 1972 after 27 years as her art advisor.

Sewell told the Sunday Times: 'Anthony told me in the mid-60s that he had been a spy. It simply came up in a conversation one day. I didn't see any reason to discuss it with him much more.'

When Mrs Thatcher unmasked Blunt in 1979, Sewell recalls how he went to his friend's flat near 
London's Marble Arch and took him by car to a house in Chiswick where 
two art experts lived.

Sewell,
whose latest memoir Outside II is published on November 1st, told the 
paper that Blunt stayed with them for a while, while the media thought that he had fled abroad.

Blunt,
who died in 1983 at the age of 75, was stripped of his knighthood and 
other honours after his spying became public knowledge.

Decades after the scandal, Sewell is 
quoted today as saying he understood Blunt's actions and condemned the 
way his friends treated him.

He told the paper: 'What was more treacherous was the way that some friends would then have nothing to do with him. I think so many conveniently forgot the atmosphere in the 1930s where any half-intelligent person was being pushed to the left or the right.'
