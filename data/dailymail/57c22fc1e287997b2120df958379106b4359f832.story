For anyone involved in Glasgow 2014, there’s no denying that the nerves are starting to kick in. The tension has moved up a notch and, as the Commonwealth Games move closer, it can only increase.

For swimmer Craig McNally, however, that’s just how he likes it. The more nervous he is before competing, the better.

After months of painstaking training, during which he pushed himself to new limits with a schedule designed to getting him used to competing tired, the 21-year-old now finds himself in the strange position of feeling like he has energy to burn as he tapers down towards the action at Tollcross.

Nerves of steel: Craig McNally aims to win medals for Team Scotland in the pool at the Commonwealth Games

McNally holds the Scottish record for the 200metres backstroke, but he also has his eyes on the top prize in the 100m, an event which gets under way on Thursday, the first day of competition.

The hard work has been done. Now it’s a case of ticking over and keeping mind and body attuned but, when asked whether exhaustion or over-exuberance is easier to handle, the answer is unequivocal.

‘Being knackered is easier to deal with because you can just go and lie down for a bit whereas, if you’ve got too much energy, you can go and lie down but all you want to do is go and bounce around,’ he says.

‘I just want to keep on doing stuff at the moment, whereas normally I’d be trying to conserve all my energy because I’d have very little of it and be trying to make sure I had enough for the next few training sessions.

‘I’m still trying to conserve it now but it’s so I can use it on race day.’

However, he adds: ‘I find nervous energy is the best thing, that’s the thing I love before the race and I try to focus on getting as nervous as possible before the race because that’s what helps me go out fast and not feel the pain until the later stages of a race.’

McNally and his team-mates will move from their Aberdeen camp into the athletes’ village in Glasgow on Sunday, the latest indication of how large these long-awaited Games are looming.

‘It’s definitely starting to sink in now, having got the kit, having been with the team and with everyone tapering down and getting loads of energy,’ he continues. ‘It’s starting to feel like we should be at the competition — it definitely feels time for it now, which is good, and everyone is excited.’

With a place in the 4x100m relay team, too, McNally will compete over the whole duration of the competition.

‘I have a day or two in the middle to recover from the 100m and get ready for the 200m so it’s quite full-on,’ he says, while clearly relishing the chance to get into the action right from day one.

‘I’ll be trying my hardest for both (the 100m and 200m). The 200 is my better event and that’s the one I’m hoping to do my best on but I’m focusing on the 100 equally as much, just because that’s the first event, it gets me into the meet and I never know what will happen.

‘For me, it doesn’t really matter whether I’m racing at the start of the meet or the end of the meet, it’s just about getting myself switched on.’

The McNally clan will be out in force, along with the rest of what will be the most partisan of crowds, to cheer him on.

A medal or two - and a record-breaking performance - would be the perfect token of gratitude. The good news is that, apparently, the refurbished Tollcross venue will be perfectly suited to fast performances.

‘I’m not really sure how it all works but I know that Tollcross Pool has always been thought of as a fast pool, so I think there will be very fast times,’ says McNally, who will cast his eyes to Olympic qualification for Rio once all this is over.

‘Every time I get in, when I try to perform at my peak, I’ll be trying to improve on my Scottish record and trying to get the most out the race that I possibly can at that moment.

‘I’m looking forward to some fast times. Hopefully I’m able to get high up on the podium.’
