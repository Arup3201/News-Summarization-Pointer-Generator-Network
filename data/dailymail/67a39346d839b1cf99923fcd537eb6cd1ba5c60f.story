Paramedics had to cut away a shopping cart from a victim's face after he was robbed and then attacked while walking down a California street.

The 26-year-old man, who has not been identified, was attacked in Stockton on Friday at 2:25pm.

He tried to get away, but was hit on the back of the head and knocked to the ground, reports CBS Sacramento. 

Two of the men held the victim down as the third  proceeded to rob him by rifling through his pockets - they took all of his money.

Then the trio  - who were all wearing bandannas - slammed the man's face into the side of a shopping cart.
