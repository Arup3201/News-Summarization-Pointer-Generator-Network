Tragic: Paul Wilson, 38, died after suffering a severe allergic reaction to a takeaway meal which is believed to have contained peanuts

Police investigating the death of a father who had a severe allergic reaction to nuts have arrested two men believed to work at the takeaway which served him a meal containing peanuts.

Paul Wilson, 38, died after eating a curry from a takeaway which is believed to have contained peanuts.

The bar manager was found unresponsive in the living quarters of the Oak Tree Inn, in the village of Helperby, North Yorkshire in January.

Police have now confirmed that two men - a 51-year-old and 38-year-old - were arrested in connection with his death and have since been released on bail while the investigation continues.

The takeaway has been named locally as the Indian Garden in the nearby small market town of Easingwold.

Paul Horsman, the manager of The York pub in Easingwold was one of the last people to see Mr Wilson alive.

The pair were friends and Mr Wilson would often stop for a drink at The York on his days off. On the night before he died Mr Wilson was waiting for a taxi to take him home with the curry at the pub.

Mr Horsman, who has run the pub for 26 years, said: 'It was a shock to find out someone I was talking to 12 hours before had died.

'He came here regularly on his days off. The taxi driver who took him home came round the next day and told me.

'The CID had spoken to him because it was the last number on (Mr Wilson's) mobile.'

He said he was told that two men were taken from the restaurant by officers, adding: 'Indian Garden has been closed for at least a fortnight.

'I heard the police came at 9.30 one Monday morning. They took out bags and various items.'

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Officers are working with Trading Standards to establish the circumstances surrounding Mr Wilson’s death.'

North Yorkshire County Council confirmed 
Trading Standards were assisting police in their enquiries but would not
 comment further.

The death of bar manager Mr Wilson, who had a young son, was linked to anaphylactic shock from peanuts found in a meal.

Speaking after his death, a representative of pub company Provenance Inns, owners of the Oak Tree Inn paid tribute to Mr Wilson.

In a statement, they said: 'We are all distraught over loss of Paul, who was a fun and kind-hearted chap - the perfect guy to be working in a pub.

'He fitted in very quickly and had a great many friends. Paul will be much missed by everyone.'

There are only about ten recognised deaths from food allergy in the UK every year.

Mr Wilson’s passing came ahead of the
 Government introducing new food information regulations later this 
year, which stipulate eating establishments must provide detailed 
information about any allergens contained in their food.

About one in 100 Britons are allergic to peanuts.

It is the most common type of food allergy, which people rarely grow out of.

For unknown reasons, studies have shown a sharp rise in peanut allergies over the last 20 years.

Attempts to find a cause have proved inconclusive. Many studies have suggested unborn children whose mothers eat peanuts are less likely to develop an allergy, although this is disputed.

If you are allergic to nuts, you will not have a reaction the first time you come into contact.

At first, your immune system reacts and prepares to fight. The second time, a full allergic reaction occurs.

Symptoms often start quickly, within minutes of coming into contact with a nut - or even a fraction of a nut.

Those severely allergic will fall into anaphylaxis, requiring an adrenaline injection straight away, which will give them time to get to hospital.

Curry 
sauces from restaurants across the country are being urgently tested 
after three deaths were linked to an allergic reaction from peanuts in 
takeaways.

Safety
 chiefs fear a new food scandal with fraudsters adulterating expensive 
almond powder used to thicken sauces with cheap ground peanuts – a move 
which can prove fatal if the meal is eaten by someone suffering from a 
peanut allergy.

Connor Donaldson, 12, from Tyldesley, 
Greater Manchester, and Derek Stephenson, 32, a gardener from Stanhope, 
County ­Durham, have also died in separate cases.

Some people suffer an 
allergic reaction if they eat any type of nut, but others can safely eat
 almonds and pistachios grown on trees and are only affected by peanuts, which are grown in soil.

Under current legislation, eating establishments are legally obliged to provide information about allergens only if they are asked to by a customer.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has ordered councils to encourage restaurant owners to check their ingredients.

New rules come into effect in December which will make the labelling of possible food allergens compulsory.

A North Yorkshire County Council spokeswoman said the authority was set to launch an allergens awareness raising campaign ahead of the new legislation coming into force on December 13.

Following Mr Wilson’s death, his parents Margaret and Keith asked for donations on a JustGiving page in memory of their son to be given to Allergy UK.
