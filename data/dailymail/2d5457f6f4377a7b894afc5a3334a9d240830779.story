Threat: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he could block any moves to cut the top rate of income tax

Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, today issued a stunning threat to stymie Chancellor George Osborne's plans to abolish the 50p tax rate.

He said cutting rates for the wealthy while millions were struggling to make ends meet could 'destroy' public support for the entire tax system.

In an interview with The Independent no the eve of today's opening of the Liberal Democrat conference, Mr Clegg also acknowledged that the Government had to do more to boost growth in the economy by adopting what he called a 'Plan A-plus'.

His remarks risk a clash with Mr Osborne, the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has made no secret of his desire to abolish the 50p rate on incomes over £150,000.

There is vocal opposition to the top rate of tax, particularly from the financial sector.

Earlier this month, 20 leading economists warned that Britain now has one of the highest personal tax regimes in the industrialised world.

And on Thursday right-leaning think-tank the Institute of Fiscal studies said that the 50p rate was encouraging the wealthy to dodge taxes and move their money overseas.

However Mr Clegg made clear that as far as the Lib Dems were concerned, the priority had to be reducing the burden of taxation on lower and middle income earners.

'We are not there to rush to the aid of the top 1 per cent of very, very rich people who are not in straitened circumstances,' he said.

'If millions of taxpayers feel they are being overlooked, ignored and passed over, as preference is given to people who need the least amount of help at the moment, you destroy the very fabric of consensus without which a sensible tax system cannot survive.

'It would be utterly incomprehensible for millions of people who work hard, do their best for their families, and play by the rules, if suddenly the priority is to give 300,000 people at the very, very top a tax break.

'It is not going to happen - certainly not until there is significant progress on giving tax breaks to those on lower and middle incomes.'

Clash: George Osborne, the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, has made no secret of his desire to abolish the 50p rate of tax in incomes over £150,000

While Mr Clegg's show of muscle-flexing on the eve of the party conference season will play well with Lib Dem activists, it will infuriate many Tories who are determined to see an end to the 50p rate.

However Mr Clegg made clear the Lib Dems would back abolition in the long run only if it was not raising much revenue and if it was replaced by new taxes on 'unearned income'.

These could include a 1 per cent annual 'mansion tax' on homes worth more than £2million, a land tax, and restricting tax relief on pensions to the basic 20p rate.

Mr Clegg also risked further antagonising by Mr Osborne - who has always insisted there was no 'Plan B' alternative to his deficit reduction plan - by conceding the Government had adopted a 'Plan A-plus' to ensure growth.

'We need to do more in government. We are doing more,' he said.

'For too long people have assumed that, because we are sticking to the fiscal plan, somehow the Government is impotent. It is complete nonsense.'

'Cuts are criminal': A hoarding outside the Hyatt hotel where Nick Clegg and members of the Liberal Democrats will stay

Three people have been charged with causing a danger to road users after a protest near the venue hosting the Liberal Democrats' autumn conference.

The men - a 19-year-old from Leeds, a 21-year-old from Doncaster and a 22-year-old from Fleet in Hampshire - were arrested last night after an incident near Birmingham's International Convention Centre (ICC).

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said the men had been charged this afternoon after they allegedly scaled a bridge which connects the Hyatt Hotel to the ICC last night to unfurl a banner.

The spokeswoman said: 'As a result of these actions debris fell into Broad Street, creating a hazard to pedestrians and motorists.

'West Midlands Police continues to monitor a small peaceful protest near to the ICC. Whilst we recognise and support the democratic right for people to peacefully protest, we continue to balance this with ensuring the safety and security of all those attending these events, as well as the wider Birmingham community.'

Those charged will appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Monday.

As the Lib Dem conference opened today, members were told they face the challenge of breaking down the 'dependency culture' and setting people free.

Councillor Paul Tilsley, Birmingham City Council's Lib Dem Group Leader urged activists listening at the ICC to come up with policies which 'strike a chord with the electorate'.

Councillor Tilsley, who is also the Council's Deputy Leader said the site was important as it saw the formation of the National Liberal Federation in 1877 and a speech by Gladstone.

He said: 'The challenge for us not only as a party, but as part of the Coalition is how we can break down the dependency culture that was created by the last Labour Government.

'We have to set people free, we have to give them the opportunity of getting away from what has become state subsidies.'

Cllr Tilsley added: 'So the challenges that we have over the next few days are to come up with policies that strike a chord with the electorate, who will point the country in the right direction and ensure that it all started in Birmingham because of our heritage as far as Liberalism is concerned.'

The Lib Dem leadership will attempt to notch up an early success with activists today by opening the conference with a pledge to press ahead with moves to legalise same-sex marriages.

Pledge: Lib Dem Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone will promise a public consultation on gay marriage

Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone will use her speech to promise a public consultation early next year, ensuring legislation can be in place by the time of the next general election in May 2015.

However - in a possible sign of conference season tensions within the coalition - senior Conservatives were making clear the move had been pushed through with the personal backing of David Cameron.

The five-day conference event is the first major gathering of Lib Dem activists since nearly 700 of its councillors were ejected in a local election bloodbath in May.

That humiliation was swiftly followed by a crushing referendum defeat for its cherished ambition of changing the voting system.

In what party president Tim Farron describes in his conference message as a 'particularly distressing' year, the party has also faced student anger and riots over its U-turn on scrapping tuition fees and seen its opinion poll rating remain very low.

The election results sparked calls for Mr Clegg to quit as party leader but he instead promised a 'muscular' campaign to exert a stronger Lib Dem influence over Government policy.

Apparent successes, notably in securing extensive changes to the Tory-led NHS reforms, appear to have calmed internal dissent though that issue could still prove a flashpoint with staunch critics of even the reformed package seeking a vote on the issue.
