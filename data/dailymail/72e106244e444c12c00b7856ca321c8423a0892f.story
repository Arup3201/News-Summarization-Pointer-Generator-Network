Thirty-two arrests of suspected mobsters or mafia associates were made in dawn raids across New York and New Jersey today as part of an ongoing investigation into mafia control of the private garbage-hauling industry. 

Suspected members of five key criminal families in the area were arrested, according to ABC News.

They said figures known as 'Papa Smurf,' 'Uncle Sonny' and 'Joe Cali' in the criminal underworld had been detained and charged with running an extortion racket.

It is the lastest operation in the joint FBI and police investigation investigating illegal ties between waste disposal and the mafia.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, said they believed those charged control several garbage-hauling businesses in five suburban counties.

'Organized crime still wraps its tentacles around industries it has fed off for decades,' Bharara told ABC, 'but law enforcement continues to pry loose its grip. Here, as described in the indictments, organized crime insinuated itself into the waste disposal industry throughout a vast swath of counties in New York and New Jersey, and the tactics they used to exert and maintain their control come right out of the Mafia playbook -- extortion, intimidation, and threats of violence.'

Charges against those arrested include racketeering, extortion, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy to transport stolen property.

One of those arrested recently retired as a state trooper from the New York Police.

Mario Velez, of Peekskill, also worked as a school resource officer at Hendrick Hudson High School according to the report and is charged with extortion for crimes undertaken while he was a police officer.

The suspects are accused infiltrating and extorting trash collection companies and using violent threats to control the businesses. 

Twelve of those accused are said to be members or associates of the Genovese, Gambino and Luchese organized crime families. 

'In addition to the violence that often accompanies their schemes, the economic impact amounts to a mob tax on goods and services,' George C. Venizelos, head of New York's FBI office, said in a statement.

Mob tentacles: Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the mob's tentacles may be around the garbage industry but law enforcers are making headway in removing them

Court papers allege the extortion 
ring controlled several trash hauling companies in Westchester, Rockland
and Nassau counties in New York, and in Bergen and Passaic counties in 
New Jersey.

The men extorted protection money from the companies and told them which routes they could use, the papers say.

'If
any of the controlled companies broke the rules or an outside company 
sought to compete by offering lower prices or better service, those 
companies would "face threats of, and actual force or fear of economic 
reprisal,' the papers say.

Two defendants, angered that they weren't getting their illicit cut of hauling fees quickly enough, stole a garbage truck and kept it until they were paid, the papers say. In another instance, the ring swiped garbage containers from a competitor in New York and repainted them for use by a mob-controlled hauler in New Jersey, they add.

Some face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of racketeering conspiracy.
