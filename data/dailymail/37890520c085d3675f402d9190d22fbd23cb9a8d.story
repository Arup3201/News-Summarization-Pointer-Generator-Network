The Olympics have not even started yet, but one weary guard for beleaguered security firm G4S was sacked after he was found napping on the job.

The sleepy worker was spotted slumped in a staff entrance of the plush Worsley Marriott Hotel in Salford - which will host football teams including Team GB.

In the latest of a seemingly unending catalogue of embarrassments for G4S, the guard was swiftly hauled before bosses and sacked on the spot for the 'unacceptable' behaviour.

His only saving grace, perhaps, was that the man bothered to show up for work at all, as it emerged this week that just 17 out of 56 guards expected to report for duty at the hotel actually appeared.

Similarly, just four of the 58 staff expected to 
report for duty at the Hilton Hotel in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, showed 
up, one of whom later disappeared.

A spokesman for G4S said: 'The guard was found asleep in the staff entrance.

'He was told that this was a very serious matter and that security could have been compromised. He was dismissed and led away.'

Team GB, which includes United star and Worsley resident Ryan Giggs and City defender Micah Richards, are one of several teams that will stay at the complex.

Senegal, Uruguay and the United Arab Emirates are also set to stop there.

G4S has rarely been out of the 
headlines since it admitted it had failed to employ enough staff 
to fulfill their £284million contract obligations.

As a result around 
3,500 troops have been commissioned to help secure the Games.

Yesterday it was revealed two G4S security guards who were due 
to protect footballers during the Olympic Games were arrested on 
suspicion of being illegal immigrants.

The
men, believed to be from Pakistan, had secured jobs with the 
under-fire firm to work at the City of Coventry stadium, which is due to
host 12 matches.

Officers swooped on the venue after 
their alleged bogus status is said to have been revealed in an 
accreditation check by G4S, which has been criticised after failing to 
provide enough staff for the Games.

The firm, which last week admitted it 
could not meet its contracted target of 10,400 guards despite employing 
650,000 people worldwide, then notified the police and UK Border Agency.

The men, who are aged 21 and 24, 
worked for East Midlands Security and would have been part of the effort
to 'lockdown' the venue in a bid to guard it from terror attacks.

Some G4S guards have also revealed they had not received schedules, uniforms or training with less than a fortnight to go until the event kicks off.

The revelation comes after David 
Cameron vowed to 'go after' G4S for the costs of the Olympic 
security fiasco, which has seen the deployment of the extra soldiers and 
police to plug gaps at Games venues.

Speaking on a visit to Afghanistan, 
the Prime Minister saluted the military for 'stepping up to the plate' 
in helping deal with the shambles left by the private security firm.

And
he said he insisted he was 'confident' that he could meet his promise 
to bring British troops back from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

It 
came as the Government hinted that G4S would lose its £57million 
management fee for overseeing the Olympic security operation.

He
said: 'Let's be clear, if G4S don't fulfil their contract we will go 
after them for the money to make sure that they help pay for the 
military personnel that have been brought in.'

When
it was suggested London 2012 had become the 'soggy Olympics', Mr 
Cameron launched an impassioned defence of what had been achieved, 
including delivering the park on time and on budget.

'Let's not call this the wet and soggy Olympics, it is a great moment for our country,' he added.

'Yes,
there are challenges and the military have stepped up to the plate and I
salute them for it. Let's not call it a soggy Olympics, let's call it a
great Olympics.

'When it comes to the Olympics we have to be ready for any contingency. We have to make sure they are safe and secure Olympics.

'I salute and applaud what the military have done to step in and I think they're doing an excellent job.

'If
there are further steps we have to take, of course we will take them, 
but I think the responsibility should be for G4S to make sure that their
people are there to provide enough security.

'But
the Army are playing a vital role. Be in no doubt whatever it takes to 
provide a safe and secure Olympic Games, we will do it.'
