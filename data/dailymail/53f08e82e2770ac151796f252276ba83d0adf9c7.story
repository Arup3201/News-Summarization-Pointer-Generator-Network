A girl motorcyclist died after a collision with a teenage biker friend who was thought to have been  performing a ‘wheelie’ stunt at up to 100mph, an inquest was told.

Hairdresser Leah Davies, 19, was  edging out of a side road on her motorbike when 18-year-old Ryan Smith, who also died, smashed into her on his yellow Honda 600cc.

Her Yamaha collided with a third motorbike that was stationary, and all three riders were thrown from their bikes, suffering  horrendous injuries.

Miss Davies, who was an identical twin, and Mr Smith, an apprentice welder, both died later in hospital while the third motorcyclist spent weeks recovering from his injuries.

They were part of a group of young friends who had met at Martland Mill Industrial Estate, in Wigan, during the evening of July 29 to show off their cars and motorbikes to each other.

Oliver Pugh, 17, told the inquest that the group had gone to the  event after hearing about it  via Facebook. 

He said: ‘We walked around and looked at other cars and motor-cycles for about 20 minutes. We left more or less one after another.’

The inquest heard that when they left the meeting shortly before 11.30pm, Mr Smith went off on his own and circled a roundabout at the top of the road before roaring back towards his friends with his front wheel in the air. Mr Pugh said: ‘He must have been going between 80 to 100mph when he passed me. The front wheel was up because he was doing a wheelie.

‘I know it was a wheelie because it was off the floor for a long period of time. I only saw the wheel come down at the last second.’

The teenager said he thought  Mr Smith’s vision could have been impaired by his raised front wheel.

He added: ‘I saw Leah pull out of the junction, she was going up towards where we had been. At the time of the collision I believe Ryan was in the centre of the road.’ Another friend, Ryan Yates, 17, said: ‘Ryan overtook me very close. He was doing at least 100mph.

‘He was in third or fourth gear, I could hear the noise it was making – it was screaming.’

He added: ‘Leah was edging out and then she stopped. She would have seen Ryan at the last second.’

Her mother Mandy Lawrenson said: ‘Leah was a happy child and engaged in lots of activities.

'She was very well liked and was a good singer and was always somebody who was positive, outgoing.

‘She met a friend who had  an interest in motorcycles  and through the friendship she became involved.

‘Leah’s grandfather had an  interest and helped her with  her motorcycle.’

She said her daughter had bought the Yamaha in January last  year and had taken a second job  to pay for the motorbike and  riding lessons.

Mrs Lawrenson said: ‘She kept the bike at her grandfather’s house most of the time and every Sunday she would go out on it.’ The inquest in Bolton was told there were no drugs or alcohol in Mr Smith’s system.

His mother, Rosemary Smith, told the hearing: ‘From the age of four Ryan had a fascination with  anything with two wheels.

‘His family very much supervised him and my husband tried to  nurture him and show him the right way to ride cycles.’

Deputy Coroner Alan Walsh recorded a narrative verdict on the deaths of both teenagers and extended his sympathies to their families.
