The husband of Teresa Romero, the Spanish nurse who survived Ebola says his wife is heartbroken that authorities killed their dog Excalibur while she was in the hospital.

Ms Romero, 44, went into isolation on October 6 after caring for two infected priests at Carlos III Hospital in central Madrid.

She is now questioning why her beloved pet was put down when it was not to blame for her contracting Ebola.

Saved: Teresa Romero, 44, has tested negative for Ebola weeks after contracting the disease, the Spanish government said. But her dog Excalibur (pictured) was put down as a precaution, sparking a national outcry

'She is asking herself why they killed the dog, who wasn't to blame for anything,' her husband Javier Limon told Spanish newspaper El Pais.

Spanish officials had said the dog was a possible risk for transmitting the deadly virus.

In the United States, the dog of a nurse infected with Ebola was quarantined and tested negative. 

Ms Romero's case blew up into mass protests when Excalibur was put down despite it being unclear whether the pet had the virus. 

Thousands of angry protesters marched in the streets of Madrid calling on the government's health minister Ana Mato to resign after the pet's death on October 8.

Ms Romero's recovery could prompt further criticism by the protesters, 390,000 of whom signed a petition urging officials to save Excalibur's life.

Although Ms Romero's recovery would not have changed the odds of Excalibur contracting the disease, protesters had insisted the animal could have been cared for safely in quarantine.

U.S. officials took just that tack when they announced they would be saving Bentley, the spaniel belonging to Ebola patient Nina Pham in Dallas, Texas. 

This week Ms Romero tested negative for the disease, the government said in a statement. Further tests will be carried out tonight to confirm the result, as patients must be re-tested within 72 hours.

The nurse cared for Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone.

Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia.

Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name.

One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo. 

Romero is the only known sufferer of Ebola in Spain after the death of the two priests.
