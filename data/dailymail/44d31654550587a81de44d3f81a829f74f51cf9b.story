A Connecticut state trooper has pleaded guilty to stealing jewelery and $3,700 from the body of a motorcyclist who died at the scene of a crash after it was caught on his dashboard camera.

Aaron Huntsman, 45, entered an Alford plea for third-degree larceny and tampering with evidence - meaning he does not admit to the charges but accepts he would likely be found guilty at a trial.

The trooper, who had been with the department for 18 years at the time of the crime in 2012, will spend more than a year in prison, the Connecticut Post reported.

He 
allegedly stole a gold chain, valued at $5,500, and a roll of cash from 
49-year-old John Scalesse's body when he was killed after he crashed 
into a truck on Route 15 in Fairfield on September 22, 2012.

Plea: Former state trooper Aaron Huntsman, pictured left with his attorney in court in 2012, pleaded guilty to stealing a deceased motorcyclist's gold chain and more than $3,000 in cash

Huntsman was the first trooper to the scene and his dashboard camera filmed him walking over to the body, picking up the chain from a pool of blood and taking out the cash from Scalesse's pocket.

He later told the victim's family that he had not seen any money on him.

An investigation was launched after the deceased man's relatives expressed concerns about missing items and the police log failed to show the jewelry.

When questioned about the items by his supervisor, Huntsman said he had left the chain in the cup holder in his police car inside a glove and had forgotten about it - but denied having the cash.

The money 
was later found under the seat in Huntsman's cruiser, police said. 
Despite the evidence and the footage, Huntsman maintained he was 
innocent.

He was arrested in November 2012 and left the state troopers in May 2013.

Investigation: Huntsman, pictured in his trooper uniform, has always denied stealing the items but they were both found in his car when authorities launched an investigation. He left the troopers in 2013

The victim's family said they were relieved that the case was over.

'John didn't deserve his memory to be 
tarnished like this and we are finally glad it’s almost over,' 
Scalesse’s mother, Marguerite, told the Post. 'After all we have gone through 
we are glad that he (Huntsman) at least didn’t make us go through a 
trial.'

Huntsman will be sentenced on October 3, where he is expected to get 16 months in prison followed by five years of probation.

He could have faced up to 10 years in prison but Superior Court Judge Robert Devlin said he would impose the shorter term but Huntsman's lawyer can still argue for a lesser term.
