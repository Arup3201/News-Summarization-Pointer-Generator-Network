If any parent was ever in two minds about letting their teenager use Facebook, their reservations may be about to increase as Facebook has allowed young people make posts public.

This means anyone on the social network will be able to see the posts, click through to the young user's profile and see any other publicly shared information.

By adding this option to users aged between 13 and 17 it also means they can let strangers 'follow' their public posts.

The privacy for Facebook posts by users aged between 13 and 17 were previously restricted to Friends of Friends, but can now be made visible to anyone. Public posts can also be 'followed' by strangers

Facebook faced a backlash from users and privacy campaigners earlier this week after announcing it was changing its privacy settings for adult users.

Facebook previously let people hide their profiles in search results using the 'Who can look up your timeline by name?' setting, but the social networking site is retiring this feature.

The option was removed from the accounts of people who hadn't enabled it last year, and Facebook has announced it is removing the feature from everyone else's accounts starting from now.

If a friend then interacts with the post - either by liking or commenting on it - the status appears on that friend's news feed - making it visible to even more people.

Before the update Facebook prevented under 18s making posts public; the widest audience they could reach was Friends of Friends.

In a blog post, Facebook said: 'Teens are among the savviest people 
using social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, 
or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard.

'So, starting 
today, people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post 
publicly on Facebook.

Facebook previously set the default 
privacy for posts made by these younger users as 'Friends of Friends' 
yet 'going forward, when people aged 13 
through 17 sign up for an account on Facebook, the initial audience of 
their first post will be set to a narrower audience of 'Friends.'

The blog continues: 'In addition, teens will be able to turn 
on Follow so that their public posts can be seen in people's News Feeds.
As always, followers can only see posts they are in the audience for.'

Before a post is made public, 
Facebook said it will display a warning message to remind users what
posting publicly means and to make sure they understand the 
consequences before posting.

As Facebook explains: 'We take the safety of teens very seriously, so they will see an extra reminder before they can share publicly.'

Facebook allows people aged 13 and over to sign up to the site, but new users only need to put in their date of birth to confirm their age - the company does not verify the information.

Commenting on the news, Jeffrey 
Chester, executive director for the Center for Digital Democracy in the 
U.S said: 'Facebook is claiming they are giving [parents and teens] more
options to protect their privacy. But in reality, they are making a 
teen's information more accessible.'

He continued the announcement 'actually removes a safeguard that teens currently have.'

However, a spokesman from the National Crime Agency said: 'It's important that children and young people manage understand the consequences of what they share online, especially with anything that is available publicly.

'Robust reporting mechanisms and education messages are vital and we continue to encourage users to report any concerns they have to Facebook, or if their concerns are linked to someone's inappropriate sexual behaviour to the NCA via Child Exploitation and Online Protection service.'

The statement added the National Crime Agency welcomes the changes being made to Facebook's default sharing settings from 'Friends of friends' to just 'Friends and said: 'This will help young people understand the need to manage their privacy settings carefully and to control who they share their information with.'

Facebook faced a backlash from users 
and privacy campaigners earlier this week after announcing it was 
changing its privacy settings for adult users, too.Â
