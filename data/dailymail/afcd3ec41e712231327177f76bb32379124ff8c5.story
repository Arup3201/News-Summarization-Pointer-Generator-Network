The cost of sacking thousands of troops in one  of the largest ever Armed Forces redundancy programmes will reach almost £500 million, 

The Mail on Sunday can reveal. It is the first time  the Ministry of Defence has officially disclosed the huge cost of the controversial cuts.

Over the past four years almost one in ten soldiers has been axed as the Army has shrunk from 102,000 to 82,000 troops – its smallest for more than a century.

The Royal Navy and RAF have also each lost about 5,000 personnel as part of the restructuring programme aimed at filling a £38 billion funding black hole created by years of mismanagement.

Details of the redundancies costs  were disclosed in an answer  to a parliamentary question  by Russell Brown, Labour MP for Dumfries and Galloway.

Defence Minister Anna  Soubry replied: ‘We estimate that the costs of exit packages in 2013-14  and 2014-15 will total some £460 million.

‘Exit costs beyond 2014-15 are expected to be relatively small.’

Earlier this year the MoD was forced to admit that some soldiers serving on the front line in Afghanistan faced being made redundant shortly after their return to the UK.
