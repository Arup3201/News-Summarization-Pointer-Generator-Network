A woman witnessed instant karma after a pickup truck driver aggressively tailgated her, flipped her off and then sped in front of her - before losing control and smashing into a pole.

And even better for the woman, Tracy Lynn Sloan, she caught the whole thing on camera - which allowed police to swiftly arrest the driver, 33-year-old Jeffrey Travis White.

Sloan shared the video on YouTube and explained that she was driving along US 41 in Tampa, Florida on Monday morning when the 2008 Ford pickup truck neared her.

Threatening: Tracy Sloan began recording when this pickup started driving right behind her on Monday

Rage: Jeffrey White can be seen flipping her off as he drives past and ahead of her on US 41 in Tampa

'This pathetic excuse for a human 
being tailgated me for about three minutes,' she wrote. 'After about a 
minute, and me shaking my head, I pulled out my phone and started 
recording.

'I couldn't move over because there were trucks in the right 
lane, and I sure as heck wasn't going to speed on a rainy day with the 
roads being as slick as they were.'

After another minute, he passed her and flashed her his middle finger before eventually speeding up and cutting left in front of her.

But as he increased his speed, he lost control of the vehicle and crossed into the lane of oncoming traffic.

Danger: He begins swerving into the lane of oncoming traffic before hitting the grass - as Sloan films

Oops: As Sloan laughs, White's truck is pictured crashed on the side of the road after hitting a light pole

Luckily, he did not hit any other vehicles, but he careened into grass and a light pole with a massive 'smash' heard on the footage.

Arrest: Jeffrey White, 33, faces charges of careless driving and failing to wear a seat belt

'That's what you get!' Sloan shouts as she drives past the wreck, laughing. 'All on video buddy!'

She added beneath the video: 'I've recorded circumstances like this before, catching idiots doing stupid things, but never ever had this happen.'

White initially left the scene but when Sloan handed over video to authorities, they were able to identify him with the footage and witness accounts to catch up with him.

'This moron could have easily killed 
somebody with his moronic behavior, and my laughing at the end would 
have been replaced with tears,' she wrote.

'Needless to say though, I've never seen 
Karma come back so fast.'

White was arrested at his home on Wednesday and faces charges of leaving the 
scene of a traffic crash, careless driving and failing to wear his seat 
belt, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

Records show White has an arrest record 
that includes old charges of battery and marijuana possession, the Times reported. He was 
arrested in 2002 and charged with disorderly conduct.

By Friday morning, Sloan's video had more than three million hits on YouTube. The sheriff's office said she will not be charged.
