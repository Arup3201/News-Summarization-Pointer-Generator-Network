The mysterious defendant charged in a
$100 million, cross-country veterans charity fraud balked at testifying
at his trial Tuesday and asked for time to decide.

The
defendant, who identifies himself as 67-year-old Bobby Thompson but has
been identified by authorities as Harvard-trained attorney John Donald 
Cody, was prodded repeatedly by the judge on whether he would testify.

There is no requirement to testify, but the judge asked to hear from the defendant directly.

Unkempt: Cody showed up in court with disheveled, greasy hair. He is charged in a $100 million veterans charity fraud

Facing trial: Cody was a fugitive for two years and was caught in Portland, Oregon with a suitcase full of cash amounting to almost $1 million

‘Mr Thompson,’ Judge Steven Gall said, raising his voice to repeat what he called ‘a simple question’ on whether he would testify.

The judge ordered a recess to let the defendant make a decision and clean up his appearance.

He had entered court with his shirt unbuttoned to the waist, his baggy pants bunched around his ankles and his hair disheveled.

‘I would like to put myself in physical appearance I think is reasonable,’ the defendant said without specifying if he would testify as the defense had signaled.

The defendant returned from the break 
and his attorney, Joseph Patituce, told the judge that the defense would
rest without testimony from his client.

That could change before the decision is announced to the jury, Patituce said during the lunch break.

The former fugitive is charged with looting the United States Navy Veterans Association charity that he ran in Tampa, Florida. The charges include racketeering, money laundering, theft and identity theft.

The defendant disappeared for almost two years after his 2010 indictment. He was arrested last year in Portland, Oregon, where agents and deputy marshals found fake IDs and a suitcase containing $980,000 in cash.

The defendant showered politicians, 
often Republicans, with political donations. The judge rejected a 
defense request to subpoena testimony from leading Ohio Republicans 
including U.S. House Speaker John Boehner.

Politicians
who received donations from him, according to campaign finance filings,
include former President George W. Bush and former presidential 
contenders Mitt Romney, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani.

Ohio
Attorney General Mike DeWine, whose office handled the trial 
prosecution, said he believes that photos the defendant had taken with 
high-profile Republicans such as Bush, Boehner and GOP strategist Karl 
Rove were used to soften up potential donors.

Besides
Boehner, political donations went to almost every member of the state’s
GOP congressional delegation and two of DeWine’s predecessors as 
attorney general.

The
trial of the one-time fugitive started on September 30. The alleged fraud spanned 41 states, including up to $2million in Ohio.

Authorities said little, if any, of the money collected by the charity was used to benefit veterans.

His
defense team had sought to force testimony by recipients to show his 
actions were legal, but a judge rejected the move last week.

His attorney said any fraud involved solicitors, not his client.

Authorities said the defendant used his VIP political connections to encourage donors to give to his charity.

While
on the run, investigators tracked him through Arizona, Florida, 
Indiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington and West Virginia.

Cody had a prestigious educational background, with a 
degree from the University of Virginia (UVA) and a law degree from 
Harvard.

He
had been a U.S. Army Captain in Military Intelligence and previously 
practiced law in Sierra Vista, Arizona from 1980 to 1984. 

During
his law career in Arizona, he became the subject of an investigation 
over claims he was stealing money from his clients but Cody skipped town
before he could be apprehended and since 1987 has been a fugitive from 
the FBI.

According to a federal warrant, dated May 4, 1987, out of the Eastern 
District of Virginia, Cody is charged with interstate transportation of 
fraudulent traveler’s checks from probate estates’ bank accounts, false 
statements to an investment brokerage firm, and false statements on loan
applications.

A
former colleague, Dennis Lusk, now chief judge of the Arizona Motor 
Vehicle Division, had worked with Cody in Arizona and remembered him as 
bizarre.

Wanted: The FBI has been searching for John Donald Cody since 1987

He described the attorney as 'intelligent enough to get through Harvard Law School and was a great talker and BS-er,' in an interview with the Arizona Republic in 2002.

His non-profit group boasted a membership of more than 
66,000 members in 40 states but little of the money raised ever made its
way to assist military service members.

Law enforcement officials began investigating Cody and he was charged with multiple counts of fraud in 2010.

Once again, he abandoned his identity and set off on a cross-country 
journey using numerous aliases to evade police.

From June 2010 to May 2012, investigators believe he hid out in Massachusetts, Arizona, New 
Mexico Rhode Island, West Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Washington and ultimately Portland, Oregon - where he was finally caught.

He
was arrested at a boarding house where he had rented a room, and 
investigators say one of the few belongings they found was a DVD of 
Catch Me If You Can, the Leonardo DiCaprio drama chronicling the wild 
history of convicted conman Frank Abagnale.
