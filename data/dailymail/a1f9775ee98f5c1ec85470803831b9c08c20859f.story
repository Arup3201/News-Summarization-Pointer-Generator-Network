While film festivals in Cannes and Venice prepare to roll out the red carpet for the rich and famous, celebrities are plotting which superyachts they will party on when they’re not attending premieres.

Those who don’t have enough cash or reason to purchase a superyacht of their own will be chartering a luxury vessel, with some fetching more than £500,000 per week in rental costs.

Last week superyachts from around the world converged on the popular Caribbean island of St Barts, where Leonardo DiCaprio, Rihanna and other celebrities soaked up the sun or let loose over the holidays.

A similar scene will play out on the Mediterranean Sea this spring and summer as the temperature rises and celebs and supermodels flock to the French and Italian rivieras for work and play.

And some of the vessels where they will retreat to are equipped with some of the most extravagant amenities at sea, with crew who will cater to every need.

There are helipads for those who can’t be bothered to take a limousine from the airport to the port, spacious decks for all-night parties, and luxurious interiors for dinner parties with guests.

These are some of the superyachts available for private hire from Edmiston in 2015.
