A fearless teenager has snapped these vertigo-inducing pictures while dangling 700ft in the air from some of London’s tallest skyscrapers.

Harry Gallagher, 17, from Essex was able to dodge security to scale the likes of the ‘Walkie Talkie’, the ‘Cheesegrater’ and the unfinished London Pinnacle.

The adrenaline junkie and his friends, who do not use safety equipment or harnesses, treat the scaffolds surrounding multimillion pound towers as their own urban climbing frames.

Harry Gallagher and his friends (pictured his friend Johnny on a crane over Canary Wharf) have scaled dozens of London's tallest skyscrapers to capture photographs

They are part of a growing community of cityscape adventurers known as Urban Explorers and prefer to use the huge cranes bestriding buildings to capture views of the capital.  

Last month Mr Gallagher, who is also a free-runner, mounted a crane taller than the under-construction Baltimore Tower at the Isle of Dogs, which will be almost 500ft when it is completed.

He said: ‘We’d been planning it for weeks, every little detail like what time we should arrive - we ended up at the bottom of the crane at 4am.

‘There was security there but I was still surprised how easy it was.

His legs can be seen dangling as he sits on top of a huge crane overlooking London to capture a series of photographs. He is part of group known as Urban Explorers

‘The view was amazing. We could see all of Canary Wharf and all over the rest of London. We stayed up there for three hours but I wanted to spend the rest of the summer there.’ 

His death-defying stunts are similar to the ‘skywalkers’ of Russia and Ukraine who hang from the edges of buildings, but the retail assistant insists he is more interested in taking photographs.

He added: ‘For skywalkers it’s about the risk, to climb towers and balance. We go up to enjoy the experience and to take photos.

‘As far as hobbies go, it’s just as dangerous as other extreme sports like motor sports, skiing or snowboarding.

‘I feel perfectly safe whenever I climb because I’ve been training for a long time. I have been free running for seven years and I think that has given me strength and, importantly, balance.

The group have been able to evade security and without any safety equipment climb massive towers in order to capture these breath-taking images of the capital

‘When I am at the top, I’m constantly making sure my hands have got a tight grip. I don’t move until I know I am secure.’

Mr Gallagher, who also favours extinct rail lines and disused reservoirs for climbs, explained the last thing to do is to think about slipping and plummeting whilst hundreds of feet above the ground.

He said: ‘I understand that I might not be setting the best example.

‘My theory is that if I can do it at 10ft I can do it at 100ft or 40 stories. But I would be lying if I said I don’t think about falling. But if you think you will fall, you will fall. The key is to think positive.’

Despite evading security in dozens of cases, not all climbs have been successful as he discovered after his first and only run in with police while climbing the frame of plush new apartments in Vauxhall, south London.

His friend Johnny is seen at the end of a crane snapping photographs overlooking Canary Wharf on a bleak misty morning in the capital. Harry says his mother refuses to look at the images they capture and is 'not happy' about his high-climbing hobby

He explained: ‘We were arrested about six months ago - within about 30 minutes of starting the climb we were in the back of a police car.

‘There were cars, a helicopter and police dogs looking for us.

‘Luckily on that occasion the charges were dropped. I found if you respect the police, they respect you.’

Mr Gallagher and his friends have seen security being tightened up in recent times but he says he isn't worried about getting caught again.

'If I'm doing it to capture pictures and not to be destructive I think the police can understand.' 

But the teenager’s toughest challenge has been convincing his mother to look at his impressive portfolio of photographs.

He said: ‘My mum knows what I’m doing. It was almost impossible for her not to find out because I was out all night.

‘But she doesn’t want to hear about it. I can’t say she is happy about it and she doesn’t want to see any of the photos.’

Harry stands on a narrow bar of a crane to take this vertigo-inducing image. He has been free running - or leaping from tall buildings - for seven years
