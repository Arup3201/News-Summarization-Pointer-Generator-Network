Two former American Eagle Outfitter employees are accused of beating, strangling and then setting on fire an assistant manager at a store in Fort Worth, Texas, to steal thousands of dollars of Black Friday sales.

Carter Cervantez, 25, and her boyfriend Clarence ‘David’ Mallory, 19, have been charged with capital murder in the Nov. 28 death of Ashlea Harris, 31, according to police documents released on Monday.

Harris was last seen by a friend, who had stopped by her apartment after she completed a shift for Black Friday, at about 3 a.m. on November 28, police said in an arrest affidavit.

Ashlea Harris' body was found partially burned and she had been beaten. Her hands and feet were bound with duct tape, police said

She was found dead in her apartment several hours later when firefighters responded to a fire alarm.

Her body was partially burned and she had been beaten. Harris’ hands and feet were bound with duct tape, police said.

A neighbor told police that he had heard a thump and screaming from the apartment, the police affidavit said.

Cervantez and Mallory had been fired from the store at the Hulen Mall during the Summer after being suspected of stealing nearly $18,000 from the store's safe.

Police believe the pair killed the woman and took Harris's keys with plans to steal Black Friday profits of about $50,000 from the store, according to the affidavit.

The day after Harris' murder, Cervantez was caught by surveillance cameras trying to open the doors to the store, but they had already changed the locks.

Mallory and Cervantez were taken to the Fort Worth Jail where they were booked on the capital murder warrant.

Both were questioned and denied involvement, the affidavit said. Bond was set at $500,000 each.
