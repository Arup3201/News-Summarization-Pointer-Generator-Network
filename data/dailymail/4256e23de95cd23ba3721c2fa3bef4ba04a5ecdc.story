It's the horror wedding story which  turned a couple's perfect day of celebrations into a horror story.

Matt and Laurie Young had returned home to celebrate their Canadian wedding with their Australian friends, inviting them to a guest hall reception at Narabeen, on Sydney's northern beaches, where they asked for cash and vouchers as gifts, instead of presents. 

But during the celebrations - when they were joined by up to 100 guests - thieves ransacked their wishing well and stole thousands of dollars donated to them by loving friends and family.

Matt and Laurie Young are putting a call out to others to be wary of opportunistic thieves at weddings 

The money was to be the helping hand the couple needed to start their new life together and put it towards a new home.

But instead the Youngs have been left shattered by the thought that someone close to them could have potentially taken the cash.

Now they are warning of  others celebrating their special day of opportunistic thieves thinking of doing the same.

'We were in complete shock and disbelief,' Mrs Young told The Sunday Telegraph.

The pair had left their money in the hall overnight where they presumed it would be  safe until they re-visited the following day.

But when they returned to collect their wishing well to take home, they noticed their was much less than they remember seeing the night before.

'We were opening our presents at home and realised there were only two cards, far less than we remember seeing the night before.

'After making a few calls to family members we realised that a lot of the cards were missing.'

It's a story familiar with wedding and event hire company Wishing Wells Extraordinaire, whose owner Bree Martini said brides are now requesting padlocks to secure novelty storage units such as bird cages and treasure chests.

'People have told me about incidents where someone has stolen an entire wishing well, and other cases where people have removed money from open suitcases,' Ms Martini said. 

Mrs Young and her husband were shattered by the thought that it could have been someone close to them, and hoped that it was just a 'random' who sneaked in unnoticed.  

'We are really hoping it was a random person who managed to sneak in unnoticed and take the cards,' she said.  

A police spokesman said: 'While these type of incidents are rare, newlyweds are warned that when it comes to money there is always the potential for opportunistic theft.'
