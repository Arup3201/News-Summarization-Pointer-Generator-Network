Teenagers will be given an extra maths lesson a week to bring England in line with the highest-performing countries in the world.

Schools will be told to devote more time to the subject to help close the achievement gap with education systems in places such as Hong Kong and Singapore.

Global league tables rank England 39th out of 42 for the amount of lesson time spent on maths.

English will also be toughened up with a shift away from studies of celebrities and greater emphasis on writing that is more ‘substantial’.

Recent English GCSEs have allowed pupils to study the rambling armchair stories of comedian Ronnie Corbett and storylines from Downton Abbey.

The measures were unveiled yesterday as part of radical Coalition plans to overhaul the curriculum to combat years of ‘dumbing down’.

Ministers gave further details of arrangements for English and maths to be studied by 14-year-olds from September.

In maths, teenagers will study around a third more content – including new sections on ratio, proportion, vectors and conditional probability.

They will also be required to learn by heart key formulae  such as the sine and cosine rules, and the formula for the area of a triangle.

Schools will be expected to lay on an extra maths lesson each week, which are usually around 45 minutes long.

Ministers dismissed complaints from teachers that proposed new courses were too challenging, too large and could place ‘excessive demands’ on pupils.

The Department for Education said: ‘The new courses are ‘wider and deeper than the current programme and this  is intentional’.

It added: ‘International comparisons of performance in mathematics show that England’s pupils have been falling behind our competitors.

‘An extra lesson each week would put England closer to jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which both teach an average of 138 hours a year of mathematics at secondary level.’

England, in contrast, spends 116 hours a year teaching maths, or three a week during term time.

Meanwhile, one in five teachers who responded to proposals for English syllabuses complained that ‘multi-media texts’ would be omitted.

But the DfE said: ‘We believe some forms of multi-media texts do not provide sufficiently rich, substantial writing to promote the development of a deep understanding and appreciation of the English language.’

Education Minister Liz Truss said: ‘The amount of time  currently given to maths teaching in our secondary schools lags behind the time afforded this key subject in world-leading countries. It is essential this  is corrected.’
