Debbie Jevans shocked rugby by resigning as chief executive of England’s World Cup organising committee less than six months before the tournament, citing personal reasons.

Her walk-out was unexpected although she is understood to have had an uneasy relationship with people in rugby since her arrival in October 2012. 

Previously director of sport at the London Olympics, she transformed England Rugby 2015.

It is believed Jevans was exasperated with the old-boy network at the top of the Rugby Football Union, once described as ‘57 old farts’ by former England captain Will Carling, who had begun lining up to take credit for delivering a tournament that had been her ‘baby’. 

The RFU’s plans for ‘the glorification of the uninvolved’ by taking back ownership of the tournament had upset Jevans, who is Sport England’s deputy chairman and on the Football League board.

RFU finance chief Stephen Brown is the new ER 2015 managing director alongside chairman Andy Cosslett, who said: 'On behalf of the ER2015 Board I would like to extend our enormous appreciation for all that Debbie has brought to the role.

Jevans was previously director of Olympic sport for the London 2012 Games

'Her legacy will be seen during and after the tournament is delivered, with a sporting event that I fully believe will be both memorable and inspiring, creating a step change in interest and participation for the game in this country.'

World Rugby chairman Bernard Lapasset added: 'On behalf of World Rugby I would like to thank Debbie for her vision, dedication and leadership in implementing everything we need for an exceptional Rugby World Cup and wish her all the best for the future. We are confident that Rugby World Cup 2015 will be the biggest and best to date.'
