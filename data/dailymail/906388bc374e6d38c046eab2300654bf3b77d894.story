A daredevil delivering an American football to one of Europe's biggest stadiums missed the giant arena and landed on a railway track instead. 

The bungling parachutist was planning to land on the turf of the 82,000 capacity Croke Park stadium in Dublin, but instead got blown off course and was forced to come down on a train line. 

Luckily for the jumper, no train was passing at the time he landed.

The college football match between Penn State and the University of Central Florida attracted more than 20,000 American visitors to Dublin. 

Before the game, two F16 jets flew passed the stadium at around 800ft causing a number of car alarms to go off in the Drumcondra area of Dublin. 

Following the flypast, a pair of parachutists, one representing each team was due to drop into the stadium having jumped out of another aircraft over the Dublin docklands. 

While the Penn State jumper managed to land in the centre of the pitch safely, the UCF parachutist got blown off course. 

The parachutist struggled to line up with the Hill 16 side of the stadium which has a low terrace and instead was forced to land on a railway track adjacent to the ground.

On the pitch, the news was equally bad for UCF after they were beaten by a late field goal, 26-24 in front of 55,000 fans. 

American football fans in the Irish capital were treated to a thrilling contest as two college teams made their way across the Atlantic to play their season opening game.

And it was Penn State who prevailed thanks to the 36-yard field goal from Sam Ficken as time expired.

Behind second-half replacement quarterback Justin Holman, the Knights appeared to have scored their own unlikely comeback victory when Holman scored on a 6-yard touchdown run to put UCF up 24-23 with 1:13 left.

But Christian Hackenberg - capping a 32-for-47, 454-yard performance - coolly directed a seven-play drive to set up Ficken's fourth successful field goal as the Penn State bench swarmed the field.

Saturday's winners received the Dan Rooney Trophy, a specially commissioned football made of ancient Irish bog wood, as cannons blasted blue-and-white streamers and confetti into the air at Croke Park.

Hackenberg spoiled a stunning performance by Holman, who came on for the second drive of the second half after coach George O'Leary benched the ineffective Pete DiNovo. The redshirt freshman was 3 of 8 for 18 yards.

Penn State ended the first half up 10-3, but should have been ahead by more as UCF struggled to move the ball at all. Both teams looked let-lagged in what was the first overseas game in either school's history.

The Nittany Lions' opening drive was extended by a roughing-the-kicker penalty, then Hackenberg dropped a 44-yard bomb between two defenders to receiver DaeSean Hamilton. Zach Zwinak finally punched the ball in from the 1-yard line on his third attempt to put Penn State up 7-0.

A 68-yard kick-off return by Jordan Akins gave UCF the ball on Penn State's 23, but O'Leary gambled and lost with a 4th down decision to go for it on PSU's 1-yard line. DiNovo's rollout straight into a pass rush was doomed from the start and he threw the ball away.

UCF cornerback Jacoby Glenn made a diving interception on Hackenberg's next possession, but the Knights could manage only a 36-yard Shawn Moffitt field goal to make the score 10-3.

The game tempo accelerated as soon as Holman entered the game. He ran for two touchdowns and threw for a third, a 10-yard bullet to Josh Reese with 11:31 left that narrowed Penn State's lead to 20-17.
