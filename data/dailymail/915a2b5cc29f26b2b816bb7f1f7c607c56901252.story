Two police officers have gone on the run in India after allegedly abducting a 14-year-old girl and gang raping her at their  police station on New Year's eve.

Constables Veer Pal Singh Yadav and Avnish Yadav were suspended before absconding from the police station in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh.

Authorities have launched a massive manhunt for the two constables and are calling for serious disciplinary action to be taken against them.

Victim: A 14-year-old girl was allegedly abducted by two Indian police constables who took her back to their police station and gang raped her

The girl's mother reported the incident claiming the two officers had abducted her daughter when she left the house to use the toilet  and bundled her into a car at around 4.30pm.

She said in a statement: 'On the night of December 31, my daughter went out of the house to address nature's call, while she was returning from the field the two police constables Veer Pal and Avanish pushed her in a car and sped to the police station. 

'They locked my daughter in a room located in the police station. Later, they raped her and when her condition deteriorated they dumped her on the outskirts of the village at midnight.'   

On New Year's day, the girl and her mother went to Musajhag police station to report the incident and lodge a complaint against the constables but claim no one would listen to them. 

Badaun, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly region, gained notoriety last year after two girls were found hanging from a tree in a village amid reports they had been gang-raped and murdered 

It was only after them meeting the city's superintendent of police and the incident receiving some media attention, that the complaint was taken seriously and a search for the officers was launched.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has demanded  all efforts now be made to arrest the officers and that serious disciplinary action be taken against them when caught.

In November investigators concluded that the girls had committed suicide, however many have disputed this explanation.

India brought in tougher rape laws last year for crimes against women after the fatal gang-rape of a physiotherapy student on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012.

Last year a woman was raped by up to 13 men in West Bengal as punishment for a relationship with a local man that was not sanctioned by village elders.

In October last year, another teenager in West Bengal was attacked twice, including one assault on her way back from a police station, and eventually murdered. 

The number of rapes reported in New Delhi increased by nearly a third in the last year, police said Friday, highlighting the alarming levels of sexual violence against women in the Indian capital.

At an annual briefing with reporters, Delhi Police Commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi said that a total of 2,069 rape cases were reported in New Delhi in the 12 months leading up to December 15, against 1,571 reported the previous year, an increase of 31.6 per cent.
