Kid Rock has sparked the anger of animal rights activists after he was pictured posing with a dead mountain lion.

The singer is seen in a image standing alongside right-wing rock singer Ted Nugent, holding the animal's body in the snow.

The picture was uploaded to the Facebook page of Nugent, who defended hunting as legal and necessary in the caption.

Ted Nugent posted the picture of himself and Kid Rock holding up the dead lion to his Facebook page, but it has sparked anger from animal rights activists 

He wrote: 'HAIL my MotorCity boy KidRock for saving all those muledeer elk & livestock by whacking this magnificent mountain lion.

'I can hear the braindead squawkers already with their obscene denial that killing lion is wrong. Its legal its necessary its good its beneficial its a damn riot!'

It is unclear how the cat was killed but hunting mountain lions is not illegal due to the Animal Control Damage Act with allows them to be killed if they pose threats to agriculture or livestock.

However, many people have hit out at the pair for posing with the dead animal.

International media director at PETA Ben Williamson told the Huffington Post: 'It's obvious that not everybody has evolved mentally and emotionally when you see someone grinning after gunning down another living being who was busy minding his or her own business and living life.

'These days, only the very smallest percentage of people find it acceptable in any way to support blood sports like trophy hunting.'

Kid Rock has also blasted critics of the film American Sniper, which tells the story of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle 

In addition one fan wrote on Facebook: 'I always thought that Ted Nugent believes in only hunting what he can eat? Nobody eats mountain lions. I get the protecting but that's the circle of life. Mountain lions need to eat to survive too! They don't need to be killed! Not happy with Kid Rock!'

The picture comes after earlier this week the 44-year-old blasted critics of the film American Sniper in a blog post.

Both actor Seth Rogen and filmmaker Michael Moore appeared to make controversial statements about the film, which profiles Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL who was described as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history.

CBS Detroit notes that Kid Rock has responded in a post on his site titled 'AMERICAN SNIPER, MICHAEL MOORE AND SETH ROGAN (sic).'

Ted Nugent, pictured, is a board member of the National Rifle Association and often posts hunting pictures of dead animals on Facebook 

Rock wrote: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon.

'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.'

Meanwhile Mr Nugent, who is a board member of the National Rifle Association since 1995, often posts hunting pictures of dead animals on his Facebook account.

In 2012, he was fined $10,000 after he illegally shot and killed a bear in May 2009 on Sukkwan Island in Alaska.
