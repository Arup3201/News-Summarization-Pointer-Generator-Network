Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. has accused the NFL of overreacting to the video of former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City casino elevator which emerged on Monday.

In the light of the shocking video, Rice was fired by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL, but according to Mayweather the organization had got it right when it originally handed the NFL star just a two-game suspension during the summer.

'I think there's a lot worse things that go on in other people's households, also,' Mayweather told reporters at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas on Tuesday. 'It's just not caught on video, if that's safe to say.'

Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. has accused the NFL of overreacting to the video of former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee  which emerged on Monday

The undefeated five-division world champion has had his own domestic abuse issues and currently faces a trial by jury after his ex-fiancee filed an explosive civil lawsuit last week.

Shantel Jackson claims the fighter subjected her to years of torment through physical and emotional abuse including preventing her from leaving his Las Vegas mansion.

In 2012 the boxer spent two months in a Las Vegas jail for a domestic violence attack in which he twisted ex-girlfriend Josie Harris's arm in front of two of their young children.

Mayweather still maintains his innocence even after pleading to reduced domestic abuse charges in the 2012 case.

Had he not taken the plea bargain, the boxer would have gone to trial on felony charges that could have gotten him up to 34 years in prison.

On Tuesday Mayweather said he has been falsely accused many times.

Ray Rice was fired by the Baltimore Ravens on Monday and a day later his wife Janay Rice released a statement supporting her husband and criticizing the media for drawing attention to the incident in February

Explosive video footage released on Monday showed Ray Rice punch his then fiancee unconscious and led to him being indefinitely suspended from the NFL

'Like I've said in the past, no bumps, no bruises, no nothing,' he said.

'With O.J. and Nicole, you seen pictures. With Chris Brown and Rihanna, you seen pictures. With (Chad) Ochocinco and Evelyn, you seen pictures.

'You guys have yet to see any pictures of a battered woman, a woman who says she was kicked and beaten (by Mayweather). So I just live my life and try to stay positive, and try to become a better person each and every day.'

Both the NFL and the Ravens broke their silence on Tuesday about their respective decisions to punish Rice more harshly in the wake of Monday’s video.

Commissioner Roger Goodell told CBS that ‘no one in the NFL, to my knowledge’ had seen a new video of what happened on the elevator until it was posted online.

‘We assumed that there was a video. We asked for video. But we were never granted that opportunity,’ Goodell said.

In a letter to fans, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said the team should have done more to get the video as the investigation continued, and it was a ‘mistake’ not to.

He said the team tried to get the video from both the casino and law enforcement, but the casino wouldn't share it and that authorities refused. It is common for law enforcement to decline to release evidence when an investigation is ongoing.

‘We should have seen it earlier. We should have pursued our own investigation more vigorously,’ the letter said. ‘We didn't and we were wrong.’

According to court papers seen by Mail Online, Floyd Mayweather is accused of battering, blackmailing, imprisoning and stealing from his former lover Shantel Jackson.

The 29-year-old model announced she was suing Mayweather last week, claiming at a press conference that he beat her and invaded her privacy by posting a picture of an ultrasound scan online and announcing that they broke up because she aborted their twin babies.

But in sensational court documents the full extent of the boxer's tumultuous on-off eight year relationship with the beauty is laid bare in painful detail.

Shantel says she suffered years of hell at the hands of Mayweather, 37, whose ‘outrageous acts’ caused her ‘pain and humiliation’.

During one argument, he allegedly choked and twisted her arm, while in another he held her at gun point and threatened to shoot her.

He also kept her ‘prisoner’ in his Las Vegas home, threatened to publish naked pictures he had secretly taken of her while she slept and stole thousands of dollars worth of belongings from her, her court filings claim.

And in raging verbal attacks he called her a ‘bum’ and a ‘b*tch’ telling her, ‘You're not sh*t without me. I made you who you are.’

Shantel is seeking unspecified damages from Mayweather for battery, assault, defamation, invasion of privacy, false imprisonment, harassment and infliction of emotional distress.

The case is due to be tried by jury in Los Angeles and is expected to last seven days, court papers show.

Stunning Shantel met the boxer in 2006 when she was aged 21 and working as a hostess at an event in Atlanta, Georgia.

The pair began dating and soon after Mayweather asked her to move in with him in Las Vegas.

The boxer, who was last year named the highest paid athlete of the year by Forbes, showered her with gifts including a 17 carat diamond worth $2,500,000, over 100 designer handbags and masses of designer clothing

He also lavished her with ‘substantial cash gifts’ and allowed her to use his credit card.

However, Mayweather soon became very controlling and Shantel had to ‘make herself available to him virtually at all times’ and was not allowed to work, according to the lawsuit filed on Thursday at the Superior Court of California.

Shantel, who changed her last name to ‘Jackson-Mayweather’ at the boxing champ's request, stood by her man when he was jailed in 2012 for a domestic violence attack in which he twisted ex-girlfriend Josie Harris's arm in front of two of their young children.

Court papers state that during a jealous rage, Mayweather twisted Shantel's arm, then 'choked her and forcibly took her phone away from her to look through it.'  Just a week later he begged for forgiveness and promised 'he would never assault her again' the documents continue

But just days after his release from prison, Mayweather allegedly lashed out at her in almost the same way as he had attacked his ex.

The court papers state that during a jealous rage, the undefeated boxer twisted Shantel's arm, then ‘choked her and forcibly took her phone away from her to look through it.’

Just a week later Mayweather begged for forgiveness and promised ‘he would never assault her again’ the documents continue.

Mayweather made his controversial remarks regarding Ray Rice before a small group of reporters at the MGM Grand hotel, where he made a formal fight week arrival for his rematch on Saturday with Argentina's Marcos Maidana.

Mayweather won a majority decision over Maidana in May but was roughed up at times in perhaps the toughest of his recent string of fights.

The unbeaten 37-year-old also said he plans to fight just twice more after Maidana, finishing his career next September. He didn't specifically dismiss Manny Pacquiao as an opponent for one of those bouts - as he has repeatedly done in the past - though he said reports there had been talks on a possible fight were completely false.
