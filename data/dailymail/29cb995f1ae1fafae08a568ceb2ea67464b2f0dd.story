Arrested again: Danielle Watkins has been arrested for breaking a protective order which prohibited her from any contact with any of her victims

A former Connecticut high school teacher awaiting sentencing over a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student has been arrested again after allegedly threatening to kill one of her accusers.

Police say 32-year-old Danielle Watkins of Norwalk was arrested Friday. She was first arrested in July, accused of having sex with one student at Stamford High and giving marijuana to another. Police say she threatened one of the victims at a doughnut shop Friday. 

Watkins pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor last month under a deal with prosecutors. The agreement calls for her to serve between nine months and four years in jail.

Watkins' attorney Rob Serafinowicz told The Hour of Norwalk his client's new arrest is 'an unfortunate turn of events.'

Watkins allegedly ran into the student she was accused of giving marijuana to and attacked him for ruining her career, according to the The Hour.

She screamed, that she 'will not rest until you and (the teen she had sex with) are dead'.

The teenager was so rattled by the encounter that he and his mother made the complaint to police in Norwalk and Watkins was arrested for violating an order to stay away from her victims.

Violating that order which commands her not to 'assault, threaten, abuse, follow, inter with or stalk' the vicitms is a felony and punishable by five years behind bars.'

Watkins is currently being held on a $25,000 cash bond.

In December, the Connecticut high school English teacher pleaded guilty to felony charges related to a sexual relationship she carried on with an underage student.

Watkins has two young children. She accepted a plea agreement on that will lead to a jail term of up to four years

Danielle Watkins accepted a plea agreement on Thursday that will lead to a jail term of up to four years.

The 32-year-old Watkins entered her pleas to felony charges of second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor.

The agreement calls for her to be placed on the state's Sex Offender Registry for 10 years.

She's set to return to Stamford Superior Court for sentencing Jan. 22. The plea agreement calls for her to serve between nine months and four years in jail.

Two school administrators were charged with failing to report the relationship and received probation.

Watkins, who is married with two young children, also sent the teen nude pictures during their eight-month relationship and supplied him and a friend with marijuana, cops said.

The underage student waited until after school let out for the year last year to tell authorities about the relationship because, he said, Watkins had threatened to fail him if he broke things off

On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy.

Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally combative' during the search.

As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the passenger seat, he said.

Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager.

Superintendent Winifred Hamilton said Watkins has been placed on administrative leave until the investigation is complete.

'We are aware of the allegations,' Hamilton said. 'We take these issues very seriously and always act to protect the welfare of our students.'

Address records show Watkins, lives with a man, Jermaine, whom she is believed to be married to. Facebook images suggest they have two children together.

She was also arrested earlier this year in her home town of Norwalk after prescription pills were found in her car after a minor accident. Neighbors say the married mother-of-two then went into rehab.
