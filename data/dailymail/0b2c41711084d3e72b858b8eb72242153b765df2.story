Boris Johnson sweeps into the Tory party conference today with a direct challenge to David Cameron to stand up for the ‘struggling middle’ who he claims are being ignored.

The Mayor of London arrives in Birmingham with a fresh attack on government policy towards cash-strapped working families, in a move which will fuel speculation about his hopes of challenging Mr Cameron for the leadership.

With the Tories stung by criticism that it is giving millionaires a tax cut at a time of deep austerity, Mr Johnson launched a staunch defence of families struggling with living costs who are ‘feeling utterly and understandably ignored’.

Mr Johnson last night refused to 
say if Mr Cameron was a better Prime Minister than he would be, 
insisting the claim was ‘unverifiable’.

The London Mayor - branded a 
‘blond-haired mop’ by his party leader yesterday - made a typically 
swashbuckling arrival at the Tory conference by also demanding a 
referendum on Europe, saying he doesn’t know what the current Tory 
policy is.

He called for the Government to do more to boost growth, warning it is ‘heading for disaster’ by failing to build a hub airport.

He also positioned himself as the champion of the ‘struggling middle’ who are feeling ‘utterly ignored’.

In a newspaper article today, he says middle-class families earning between £30,000 and £64,000 a year face many difficulties with everyday life, especially housing costs. He writes: ‘They are feeling utterly and understandably ignored. It is time to help them.’

Mr Johnson made clear yesterday that he would like the top job after his mayoral term is up in 2016, insisting it was healthy that he is in ‘competition’ with Mr Cameron, an Eton and Oxford contemporary.

The mayor repeatedly refused to say whether Mr Cameron is a better leader than he would be. But he did concede: ‘I’ll tell you what I’ll say. He’s a better prime minister than Ed Miliband will ever be.’

Pressed to admit that Mr Cameron was better than him, the mayor told Pienaar’s Politics on Radio 5: ‘I think it’s unverifiable. It’s unverifiable.’

Mr Johnson said his rival was ‘doing a fantastic job’ and pointed out that he had urged Mr Cameron to run for the Tory leadership.

But he was prepared to say only that Mr Cameron had been a better choice in 2005, a time when Mr Johnson had been forced to resign from the Conservative front bench and was in no position to challenge for the leadership.

‘It’s self-evidently true that in 2005, I thought he was the man for the job and I didn’t think I was the man for the job,’ he said. ‘I want to be Mayor of London. After four years is up, heaven knows.’

Mr Johnson used his newspaper column to complain that for many people in London and the South East, even those with incomes from £30,000 to £64,000, struggle to buy a home near where they work and are priced out of the market for even modest properties.

‘We need to think how to target this group — the struggling middle — that is currently not being helped, and that is so vital for the economy,’ he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

A ‘huge chunk’ of new houses are built as ‘affordable homes’ and ‘another sizeable chunk [was] of top-end stuff – swish houses and apartments, often for foreign buyers’.

It what will be seen as a direct challenge to Mr Cameron’s government, he adds: ‘We are not doing as the Victorians did, and providing new stock to be bought by the people in the middle – on household incomes from £30,000 to £64,000; and they are feeling utterly and understandably ignored.

‘They cannot get the mortgages they would need, not at current prices, and not with lenders in their current mood.

‘They have to live at a great distance from their place of work, and spend huge quantities on travel and hardly get to see their children in the evenings.’

Tensions have been clear in the 
relationship between the two men for years but they have flared in 
recent weeks after the mayor repeatedly upstaged the Prime Minister at 
the London Olympics.

But Mr Johnson said: ‘If senior politicians were endlessly pally and friendly with each other and there was no element of competition, I think people would think it was a plot against the electorate.’

Mr Cameron yesterday insisted there was ‘no point trying to contain Boris’.

In an interview he said: ‘He will always speak his mind. He’s Mayor of London, he can speak out if he wants to. So I am relatively relaxed about having the blond-haired mop sounding off from time to time.’

Later, Mr Cameron said he did not think being mayor would be Mr Johnson’s last job. ‘I have got the opposite of tall poppy syndrome. I like having other people in the Conservative Party who are popular, who get out there, talk our message and explain our vision and values,’ he said.

‘Boris is fantastic like that. He is one of those politicians people warm to and I think it is great that we have in our party figures like that. I have said to Boris, “Once you have done your job as London Mayor, don’t think your job in politics is over”.

‘I think he has got a huge amount to offer, a huge amount to give and I encourage him to do that. I think it is great that the greatest city in the world has got such a good mayor.’

But in comments likely to woo the Tory Right, Mr Johnson made clear he wants a referendum in Britain on any future EU treaty. Mr Cameron’s position is that such a referendum will be necessary only if it transfers powers from Westminster to Brussels. But the mayor indicated that he thinks changes in the eurozone would affect the UK and should be put to a vote here regardless.

David Cameron, Prime Minister

In a second dig at the PM, Mr Johnson suggested the Prime Minister’s efforts to explain his position on Europe remain unclear and took a dig at Mr Cameron’s abandonment of his ‘cast iron promise’ to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.

He said: ‘I don’t know exactly what the position is now. I think we were promised a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. My strong view is that it would be right to consult the people on any further constitutional changes within the EU.

‘If they do go forward as a consequence of the difficulties surrounding the euro with a new settlement, a fiscal union or there are big changes to the treaty which will inevitably affect us ... then I do think that must be put to the people of this country. It should be put in the form of a referendum on that particular treaty.’

Last week Mr Johnson claimed Downing Street’s slow progress in addressing aviation capacity risked ‘economic catastrophe’.

Last night he repeated those concerns. ‘I do think there’s a major problem,’ he said. ‘Unless we make sure that we both increase our aviation capacity and close down the third runway at Heathrow option, I think we are heading for a disaster.’
