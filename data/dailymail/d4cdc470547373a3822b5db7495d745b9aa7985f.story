Amazon
has come under fire for making a grab at some of the most high profile Internet
domains including .book and .app.

The
online retail giant has been branded ‘anti competitive’ for trying to buy a
slew of the next generation of names which will become available in the coming
years.

Publishers
in the US have said that the ‘potential for abuse is limitless’ were Amazon to
get its hands on too many - and could damage the entire industry.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN), the international body which decides on such matters, is currently
assessing how the new domains should be handed out.

It will be the largest expansion of the Internet address system since its creation in the 1980s.

Last year, nearly 2,000 businesses and groups submitted bids for about 1,400 different names

The
domain names are seen as the next step in the evolution of the Internet beyond
addresses like .com and .co.uk.

They
will include names like .read - seen as highly desirable by Amazon because of
its Kindle e-reader - .author along with .movie and .wow.

According
to the Wall St Journal, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN), the international body which decides on such matters, is currently
assessing how they should be handed out.

It
has invited thousands of companies, individuals and various agencies from
around the world to have their say as to what should happen.

But
in the US, publishers have pointed out that Amazon is so dominant it should not
be given control of too many.

Amazon
sells to 137m customers a week, or 19.5m a day, which is more than the
population of Beijing and more than the numbers which turned out for the last
US Presidential election.

‘The
potential for abuse seems limitless.’

He
added that if Amazon gets what it wants then it would ‘move a few inches closer
to a monopoly in the book business’ and give it an ‘enormous competitive
advantage’

US
book retailer Barnes & Noble has also claimed Amazon could ‘stifle
competition in the bookselling and publishing industries, which are critical to
the future of copyrighted expression’.

Amazon
has not yet explained its plans for the new domain names in depth and claimed
in its letter to ICANN that .app would offer ‘a stable and secure foundation
for online communication and interaction’.

Stacey
King, the company’s senior corporate counsel, said in the letter that it merely
wanted to ‘find new and innovative ways, mechanisms, and platforms to surprise
and delight our customers.’

ICANN
and Amazon declined to comment.

ICANN is overseeing the largest expansion of the Internet address system since its creation in the 1980s.

Last year, nearly 2,000 businesses and groups submitted bids for about 1,400 different names.

The initial domains, expected in mid-2013, will likely be in Chinese and other languages besides English, said Fadi Chehade, CEO of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

That will be followed within weeks by English suffixes that do not have competing bidders.

Although the specific names won't be announced until late April, they will come from a pool of single-bidder proposals - among them, ".aetna," ".cadillac" and other brand names sought by companies, regional monikers such as ".vegas" and ".quebec" and generic suffixes such as ".like" and ".vacation."

Many proposed suffixes, such as ".app," ".music" and ".tech," will likely take longer, however, because multiple groups have submitted bids to run them and must work out disputes.
