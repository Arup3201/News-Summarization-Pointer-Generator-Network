A mother who let her two-year-old son drive and then uploaded a video of the toddler chauffeur online, said the stunt was a mistake. 

Footage posted to Facebook shows little Giovanni Madrid seated on the lap of his daddy, Marine Corporal Marcos Madrid, steering the couple's car in what appears to be rainy conditions, near the Madrid's home in Richlands, North Carolina. 

Laughter can be heard in the background of the low quality video, as the youngster looks pleased with his motor skills.

But a friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, was shocked to see the video on the social networking site and alerted the local news.

'The kid could possibly die if something were to happen,' the woman told WCTI-TV.

Now the child's mother, Angelina, said she and her husband, who is stationed at Camp Lejeune, were driving down the road when their little boy, who loves cars, said he wanted to try his hand behind the wheel.

The parents obliged the toddler's whim but now the mom says it was a big mistake.

'I feel bad for doing it and I wasn't thinking, we weren't thinking,' the mother said, as she wept over the incident.

Angelina says she is fearful that the incident could prevent her husband, who just finished his first four years in the Corps, from reenlisting.

The concerned wife is scared his commanding officers will look poorly on the incident, that has garnered attention for the family for all the wrong reasons.

'Other parents could see this, they could learn not to do this,' she added.

So far, no charges have been brought against the Madrids.

Angelina's mother, Tracee Ramos, assured naysayers that her grandson is very well cared for and said his parents would never put his life in danger.

'My son-in-law and my daughter take very good care of my grandson, I love my grandson,' Ramos said.
