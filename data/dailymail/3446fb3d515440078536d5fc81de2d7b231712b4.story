If you've ever wondered what your dog really gets up to, or simply wanted to experience life from a dog's point of view, a new harness could be the answer.

The Fetch harness lets owners attach a high definition GoPro camera, made famous by extreme sports enthusiasts, to their pet.

Owners can even choose their point of view - either mounting the camera on the dog's back or chest.

The harness ca\n be attached to the dog's back or chest to capture high definition video.

The camera allows owners to see exactly what their dog does.

'Digging, running, swimming, hunting and exploring – dogs can now showcase their world using the new Fetch mount,' goPro said. 

The fully adjustable mount is designed to fit small dogs of 15 pounds (7 kilograms) to large breeds up to 120 pounds (54 kilograms).

'The adaptability and versatility of GoPro cameras make them the perfect device to document life from a dog's point of view,' said Paul Osborne, GoPro's senior director of product management. 

'We designed Fetch to meet the unique needs and usage for pets and can't wait to see the images and videos that owners will capture and share now that they have a mount specifically for their dog.'

However, for worried owners concerned their pet may trash their camera, the firm says

'Mud, snow, water and woods are no match for Fetch – the water-friendly mount holds up to the elements and can be machine or hand-washed to keep it clean.'

Just in case the extreme action gets too much, the firm also  includes a camera tether to keep the camera nearby, even if it should fall of.
