The Catholic Church should no longer run a leading school where child sex abuse went unchecked for 60 years, a damning report has recommended.

Its author, Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, said all faith schools should be run by independent educational trusts, maintaining a ‘faith ethos’ but with lay governors.

His independent inquiry found monks at Ealing Abbey in west London assaulted pupils at St Benedict’s, one of the country’s top Catholic schools, from at least the late 1940s until 2007.

Child abuse: St Benedict's School, in Ealing, west London, which is run by Benedictine monks

He detailed 21 separate abuse cases at the school.

St Benedict's is under Ealing Abbey's watch, which is run by Benedictine monks.

Four top fee paying schools, 
including Ampleforth College, North Yorkshire, and Downside, near Bath, 
share similar structures to St Benedict's.

Lord Carlile strongly criticised the 
cover-up of sexual abuse and sadistic bullying at the school and the 
destruction of documents as the abbey repeatedly failed to intervene or 
investigate.

The £12,000-a-year school’s 
headmaster, Christopher Cleugh, offered a ‘heartfelt apology for past 
failures’ and accepted Lord Carlile’s recommendations in full, including
setting up a new governing body.

Lord Carlile launched an independent inquiry into the sex abuse

In his inquiry, Lord Carlile outlined
a catalogue of failures by the west London abbey to intervene as 
allegations of abuses came to light.

‘I have come to the firm conclusion 
that the form of governance of St Benedict's School is wholly out dated 
and demonstrably unacceptable,' Lord Carlile wrote.

‘The abbot himself has accepted that it is 'opaque to outsiders'.’

The report said the crimes of Father David Pearce, 
jailed for a catalogue of abuse against five boys over a period of 36 
years, illustrate how ‘St Benedict's rule of love and forgiveness 
appears to have overshadowed responsibility for children's welfare’.

Pearce, referred to as the ‘devil in a dog collar’, was jailed in October 2009.

The report added: ‘In a school where 
there has been abuse, mostly - but not exclusively - as a result of the 
activities of the monastic community, any semblance of a conflict of 
interest, of lack of independent scrutiny, must be removed.’

Two trusts should be launched to 
remove ‘all power from the abbey’ while maintaining the Benedictine 
connection for the parents, Lord Carlile said.

Changes will be in place by the beginning of the next academic year, he added.

Mr Cleugh said the school was ‘totally’ committed to implementing the changes.

Responding to the report, he said: ‘Past abuses at the school have left a terrible legacy on those affected and have tarnished the reputation of St Benedict's.

‘On behalf of the school, I offer my heartfelt apology for past failures.’

According to campaigners, those affected by sex attacks may number in the hundreds.

The report comes after the High
Court ruled that the Catholic Church can be held liable for the 
wrongdoings of its priests.

Martin Shipperlee, an abbot at the school,
commissioned the independent review before the Vatican announced it had
ordered a separate inquiry into historic sex offences at St Benedict's and
Ealing Abbey.

Police are also hunting Father Laurence Soper, 81, over allegations of child abuse dating back to when he taught at St Benedict's from 1991 to 2000.

A former abbot of Ealing Abbey, he is believed to have been living in a monastery in Rome but was due to return to London to answer bail in March.

He is the subject of an international manhunt after a European arrest 
warrant was issued against him.

Speaking today, Lord Carlile urged Father Soper to surrender himself to officers, saying: ‘I regret very much the difficulties he has caused.’

Lord Carlile's report was commissioned by the abbey to examine how to improve child protection.
