A man had a tracker fitted to his car by an ex-girlfriend in a year-long ' campaign of harassment and stalking'.

Childminder Julie Debra McCully, 43, began stalking Mark Coplen in the summer of 2012 when they split up, a court heard.

She kept turning up wherever he was to cause him bother and he was baffled at how she always managed to find him.

The moment of realisation for Mr Coplen came when he brother joked that mother-of-two McCully could have put a tracker on his car, Furness Magistrates’ Court, Cumbria, heard.

He checked the underside of his vehicle in January 2013 and found the device fastened to it.

Police were able to work out through bank details that McCully had indeed bought the tracker.

McCully also posted letters to Mr Coplen's children in December 2012, making a false allegation that he had an illegitimate child.

Mr Coplen's ex-partner Karen White and his daughter, Leah Coplen, were also stalked.

She sent Ms White numerous texts outlining a number of her personal details which would have involved 'going to a great deal of trouble'.

Ms White said in a statement: 'I became extremely frightened. The texts identified where I lived, what car I drive, when I’d been out of the house and came home and said "I’m watching you".'

A statement from Mr Coplen’s daughter, Leah, said: 'Since she started bothering my dad, I started suffering from anxiety and have panic attacks and had to be referred for counselling.'

McCully, of Chester Street, Barrow, Cumbria, was yesterday sentenced to 26 weeks in jail, suspended for 12 months.

She was found guilty after a trial on October 1 and was convicted of two counts of harassment and two counts of stalking between May 1 last year and May 7, 2013.

John Appleby, prosecuting, said: 'It became apparent that, strangely, wherever he went, she knew where he was.'

Mr Appleby said that, when interviewed by officers, McCully claimed she had bought it with Mr Coplen’s consent because he feared his car was going to be stolen.

In his victim impact statement, Mr Coplen said: 'I just couldn’t believe it when I found the tracker. I feel like my privacy has been totally invaded.

'I still can’t believe it. I check my car all the time. I feel almost trapped.'

Defending, Trystan Roberts said a previous partner had described McCully as 'generous, warm, unselfish and kind'

She also has 'cordial relations' with her ex-husband and has never been in trouble before, according to Mr Roberts.

He said she had been a childminder for 11 years and that the conviction could have a 'fatal' impact on her career.

She was given a restraining order against all three victims.

McCully was also ordered to pay compensation to each, do 200 hours of unpaid work, pay £500 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
