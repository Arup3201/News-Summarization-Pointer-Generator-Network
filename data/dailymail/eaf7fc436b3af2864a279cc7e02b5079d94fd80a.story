Alex Matthews, 28, thought he was home and dry after the perfect romantic holiday to New York when he proposed to his girlfriend and she accepted.

But after stepping off the flight home he realised something was missing: his phone which they'd used to document the entire trip, including the moment he popped the question.  

The couple has  launched a desperate transatlantic appeal for the Galaxy phone after, they think, it was left behind on their return flight from Newark to Birmingham.

The phone contains precious photos  documenting Alex Matthews and Emma Brown's  once-in-a-lifetime trip

The phone contains precious photos and videos documenting Alex and Emma Brown's, 29, once-in-a-lifetime visit, none of which had been posted online or shared by the couple, as they were waiting until they returned home to show images to their families.

Alex, an IT consultant, spent months planning the surprise trip for Emma, a research assistant.

He roped in her family, friends and work colleagues to help keep the secret before he woke her up at 5am on August 21 last year and told her to pack her bags. 

The couple have posted their appeal on the UK's biggest online lost and found site www.Lostbox.co.uk 

It wasn't until they got to the airport that Emma discovered they were going to the Big Apple. Alex told her they were going to see a Broadway show that he had promised to take her to earlier that year.

The happy couple visited  famous sites including Times Square but it wasn't until they were standing on Brooklyn Bridge that Alex asked her to be his wife and she accepted.

After the whirlwind long weekend they flew home from Newark airport in New Jersey. But when Alex stepped off the plane in Britain he realised he'd left his phone on the aircraft containing every single picture from the trip.

Despite searches by cabin crew on the United Airlines flight the phone wasn't found, even though both Alex and Emma remember him having it on the plane. 

They had arrived on the UA27 Newark- Birmingham and still think the device could be between their seats 23b and 23a.

Now, months later, they are making one last desperate appeal to anyone who might have come across it.

The couple have posted their plea on the UK's biggest online lost and found site Lostbox.co.uk - which has been responsible for reuniting people with hundreds of items every month.

The lost phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini in pebble blue. Such is Emma and Alex's hope it will be found they have kept the contract going. 

Alex has refused to block the phone, instead choosing to use an old one, in case one day the lost phone will sync with Google and the missing photos will be found. 

Emma from Birmingham, said: 'After Alex proposed we went back to the hotel we were staying at for a dance and a drink and I remember there was an American lady there who took more pictures of us. I gave her my email address but we never got those photos either.

'Everything is on that phone, pictures of our hands on Brooklyn Bridge after Al proposed, pictures of us with the New York skyline in the background and of us in the Brooklyn River Cafe straight afterwards.

'There's video on there too. We forgot to throw the key from the padlock in the river so we filmed us doing it the next day on the water in Williamsburg. And there's another video of me looking completely overwhelmed and awestruck in Times Square, having just got off the plane.

'I don't even know how many pictures I took, I'm a picture fanatic, and we didn't even share a single one online while we there because we wanted to show everyone when we got back.

'We're still pretty confident it could be on the plane, if anyone had turned it on or off flight mode it would just automatically sync to our Google accounts. We're not bothered about the phone really - we just want the pictures.' 

Alex said: 'After we landed I had just stepped off the plane through the threshold and felt my pocket and thought 'oh, I haven't got my phone'.

'I turned round to go back on the plane but the steward said I couldn't go on and he would look for us. When he said it wasn't there we were sent to the baggage area and he said the cleaning staff would look for us.

Alex says: 'The saddest thing  is not being able to show friends and family that helped with the planning'

'At this point we were worried but still thought it would turn up. But when we got the United Airlines desk they said it hadn't been found and the plane was turning round and heading back to New York.

'The saddest thing about it is not being able to show my mum, Emma's mum and all the friends and family that helped me with the planning.

'There was a quite funny moment because my mum was picking us up from the airport. Emma came out first looking quite sad and then I came out almost looking in tears, she thought it had all gone wrong, but luckily Emma had said yes.' 

Lostbox director Clare Owen said: 'We were really touched by Emma's appeal and Alex's lovely romantic idea for a proposal. It's heart-breaking to think they could have lost the only photos they have of that amazing weekend in New York.
