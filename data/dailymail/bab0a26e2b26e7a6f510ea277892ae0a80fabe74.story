One neighbor, Linda Burkholder, told the News a strange man had been spotted in their quiet street in June and that he had walked into Ms Whitaker's driveway.

She was found dead by a fellow orchestral player and her husband on Wednesday afternoon around 4pm when they became concerned about not being able to contact her.
