A teenage girl in the same school year as tragic Tallulah Wilson has died in similar horrific circumstances after being struck by a train.

Mary Stroman was killed while an inquest was being held into the death of gifted ballerina Tallulah, 15, who killed herself at London’s St Pancras station.

The inquest into the death of the schoolgirl – who became addicted to websites glamorising self-harm and suicide – was widely reported in the media.

Police were last night investigating ‘chilling similarities’ between the deaths of  16-year-old Mary and Tallulah, who had both been pupils at St Marylebone School in Westminster.

Mary, the daughter of US musician and jazz professor Scott Stroman, died ten days ago in Yarnbrook, Wiltshire.

She is understood to have been staying in the area and was struck by a train shortly after 8pm on a foot crossing. Police had begun searching for the teenager, who had been reported missing.

Emergency services rushed to the scene but Mary, one of five children, was pronounced dead.

Sources said both girls were ‘clearly very troubled’ but there is no evidence that Mary had been on any self-harming websites.

Police do not believe the girls had been close friends – either in person or online. Mary attended St Marylebone School for about two months four years ago.

But the fact they were briefly at school together means police have not ruled out the possibility they were in close contact with each other before Tallulah’s death.

It is believed that a key line of the police investigation into Mary’s death is her medical history. The Mail has learned that the teenager had suffered health problems. Another line of inquiry is that Mary was bullied but officers say there is no  evidence of that at this stage.

School: Both girls attended St Marylebone School in Westminster, though Mary was only there for two months

Tallulah Wilson’s inquest heard claims that she had been bullied at St Marylebone school, which she attended until the summer of 2012 when she moved to St Margaret’s School in Hampstead weeks before her death in October 2012.

A teacher responsible for pupil welfare at St Marylebone said Tallulah never complained to staff about being bullied.

Last night Mary’s family issued a statement saying: ‘To all her friends and people who knew her, please remember Mary as a bright, clever and funny girl who was gentle and kind to everyone.

‘She loved animals and the outdoors, and she always had great love and affection for all of her family. Mary is now at peace with herself and it was an honour to have her as a daughter and a sister.’

A British Transport Police spokesman said: ‘Mary had injuries consistent with having been hit by a train and was pronounced dead at the scene. The incident is currently being treated as non-suspicious.’

Kathryn Pugh, head teacher at St Marylebone School, said yesterday: ‘Our thoughts and prayers are for Mr and Mrs Stroman and for their other children who attended our school. Mary and Tallulah were in the same year but not in the same form group.

‘Mary was here for a very short time, around two months about four years ago. Because she was unwell she left the school.’

Mary’s family live in a three-storey terraced home in Finsbury Park, North London.

Mr Stroman, 55, is an award-winning musician who has lived in the UK since 1982. He and his wife Sue have two sons and two other daughters, all older than Mary.

Mary is the third London schoolgirl to die in recent years in similar circumstances.

In June 2012, Rosie Whitaker, 15, killed herself by lying in front of a train after visiting websites which promote self-harm and suicide.

Rosie, from Beckenham, South-East London, was a talented ballet dancer. She suffered from bulimia and had scratched the word ‘fat’ across her stomach when she died.

Tallulah killed herself four months later. When her inquest ended on Wednesday, her mother Sarah demanded action against the ‘toxic digital world’ of the internet that glamorises suicide and self-harm.

Tallulah said Rosie was a friend of hers and paid tribute to her the day before her death. In a message posted on Tallulah’s Twitter account, which she had dedicated to Rosie, she wrote: ‘Why the **** should I stay if no one around me stays for me? It’s not ****ing fair. I’m done. I’m ****ing done #suicide #goodbye.’
