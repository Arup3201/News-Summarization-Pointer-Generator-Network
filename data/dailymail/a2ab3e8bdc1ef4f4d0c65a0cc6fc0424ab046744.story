Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has leapt to the defence of Gareth Bale following his side's 2-1 defeat by Valencia on Sunday.

With the scores tied at 1-1, Bale broke forward and opted to shoot rather than pass to striker Karim Benzema who had taken up a dangerous position inside the box.

That missed chance proved costly as Nicolas Otamendi then powered the ball in from a corner to secure victory for Valencia as Madrid's 22-match winning run came to an end.

Ancelotti, however, refused to blame the former Tottenham forward for his side's loss, insisting he made the right decision to back himself in front of goal.

'I do not think Bale is selfish,' said Ancelotti. 'I have seen the situation again and it was not easy to pass the ball, it was very complicated. He had no room and he tried to shoot.

'There is no need to talk about Bale. He knows very well when he needs to pass but he took the right decision. If he feels pressure it is positive because he has scored goals in the finals he has played in.'

Madrid remain top of La Liga despite their loss after Barcelona slipped up against Real Sociedad.

Barca boss Luis Enrique left star forwards Lionel Messi and Neymar on the bench as David Moyes' side held on for a 1-0 victory over the Catalans, but Ancelotti was not overly concerned with his rivals.

'I'm not happy about Barcelona's problems because I have things to fix of my own,' the Madrid manager added.

'I look at my own team, not what happens in Barcelona. Let's just say that teams have problems during the season.

'I do not know the dressing room of Barcelona, so I cannot comment on Luis Enrique's decision. 

'Everyone faces decisions regarding the dressing room and Luis Enrique is best placed to make those decisions. It looked like a fair one.'
