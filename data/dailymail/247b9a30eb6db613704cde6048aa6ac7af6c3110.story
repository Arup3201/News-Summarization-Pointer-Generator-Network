Michelle Obama's hairstylist has revealed that the First Lady's famous mane is not chemically straightened, noting that he works with a colorist to flatter her features with face-framing highlights.

'I love how her hair has grown so long, and it's all 100per cent natural,' Johnny Wright tells HuffPost Live.

'It's all about using great products, of course,' he adds.

Mr Wright, who first met Mrs Obama on an Essence shoot in 2007, also opened up about FLOTUS's low-maintenance hairdo when she vacations in Martha's Vineyard.

'She uses conditioner and pulls it back into a ponytail. That's exactly what she's doing for the whole month of August,' he said.

He added: 'So it's easier now, she's able to really do her own hair. I worked with her and taught her how to really straighten her own hair out when she needs to. It's no fuss in August. She doesn't want to glam up.'

Mr Wright says that he loves what Mrs Obama's highlights have done for her features, noting that he works with Frederic Fekkai colorist Daniel Villano.

He has also styled Sasha and Malia Obama, as well as the First Lady's mother, but eventually groomed his assistant to take them on as clients.

Mr Wright is known to document his adventures traveling with Mrs Obama on Instagram.

'It's exciting, absolutely, doing the first lady's hair,' Mr Wright told the Washington Post in 2009. 'She's a great lady and I feel privileged to do her hair.'
