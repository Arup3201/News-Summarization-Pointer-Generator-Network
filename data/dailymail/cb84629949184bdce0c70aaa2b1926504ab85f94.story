The glamorous wife of Gadget shop founder Chris Gorman has struck a deal with prosecutors in Florida to avoid a trial and possible prison sentence.

But it means 43-year-old Mary Gorman will agree to take part in a community service programme that could see her carry out up to 100 hours of work.

Typically, the work involves menial labour, such as picking up litter and cleaning at drug rehab facilities and will almost certainly have to be completed in Florida rather than her native Scotland.

Gorman, who is known for her love of parties, is also likely to have to undergo random drug tests.

If she fails a single test, or does not complete her community service, she will have to stand trial on the original charges.

Details of the deal came as the mother of four spoke for the first time following her arrest after allegedly being caught in a sex act with a unknown man in an Orlando nightclub toilet.

Gorman was charged with battery of a police officer and possession of cocaine at an Orlando club in August

She told MailOnline: ‘Living under the shadow of this incident has placed our family under considerable strain and so I am very encouraged that a resolution has been agreed.

‘We fully agree with our lawyer and the State Prosecutor’s office that this is the most suitable way to deal with the matter and look forward to agreeing the details in the New Year.’ 

Gorman and her husband, who have a £45m fortune, had earlier denied all the charges following the sordid incident in the toilet of an Orlando nightclub.

They had vowed to fight the charges. Their lawyer insisted they were innocent following the incident during a family holiday to the Disney theme parks last August.

Gorman, of Bridge of Weir Renfrewshire, was arrested in August after being thrown out of the Roxy nightclub when an off duty police officer saw her engaged in a sex act with a black man she had met at the club.

As she was being ejected, she assaulted officer Noah Pruitt and a search of her handbag revealed two wraps of cocaine.

Gorman was charged with drug possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and battery on a police officer.

The third degree felony charges carried a maximum of 11 years in jail.

Her 44-year-old multi-millionaire husband learned earlier this month that he would not face charges of resisting arrest.

Her trial in Orlando was due to start in February, but instead her lawyer Mark Horwitz has thrashed out a deal with prosecutors to avoid a humiliating court appearance.

Instead, Gorman will now take part in what is known as a pre-trial diversion programme.

It is eligible to first time offenders run by the Orange County State's Attorney's office in Orlando and is aimed at cutting down court costs by reducing the need for a trial.

'The type of work is always very menial and usually very hard, ‘said a source with the Orlando State's Attorney's Office.

‘As Mrs Gorman was charged with a drugs offence she could be put to work in a drug rehab centre. It would involve manual labour, such a cleaning the floors and the toilets.

‘Alternatively many of those in the programme are put on litter duties along the highways and in state parks.’

Another part of the pre-trial diversion programme will see Mrs Gorman attend anger management classes. She will also probably undergo counselling for drugs.

A spokesman for the Orange County prosecutor said:’Pretrial Diversion is a diversionary program run by the State Attorney's Office and is usually reserved for first time, nonviolent offenders. 

‘The diversion program is similar to probation, in that once you are accepted into the programme you must report once a month to a supervising officer, undergo random drug testing, complete community service hours, and refrain from being involved in any criminal activity,’ he said.

Gorman's Orlando lawyer Mark Horwitz said in a statement that the completion of the pre-trial programme will result in all the charges being dropped and no criminal record for Mrs Gorman.

The businesswoman, who runs a property development company and acts as a management consultant, is thought to have been desperate to avoid jail.

Horwitz said:’It is very positive that the State Prosecutor’s office is in agreement with this approach and the details of the programme will be agreed in the New Year.’ 

Gorman is now expected to attend a January hearing in Orlando where details of the programme will be decided.

Her lawyer had previously obtained permission from the court to allow Mrs Gorman not to appear but to go on the programme she has to meet with Orange County officials.

Orlando-based criminal defence lawyer Scott Richardson said Mrs Gorman was ‘very lucky’ to be offered the pre-trial programme as one of her charges involved assaulting a police officer.

‘Whatever attorney she has she should thank. He has done a fantastic job so far to get her into the programme when she was facing an assault charge on a police officer.

‘All of those accepted into the programme have to carry out the community service in Florida, but the judge can make exceptions.’
