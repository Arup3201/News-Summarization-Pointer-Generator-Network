A self-styled 'party princess' has been jailed for four years, just days before her 21st birthday, after being found guilty of running over and killing a father while drunk.

Karlie Tomica sobbed in a Florida court today as she admitted to drinking heavily during a bar tending shift at a nightclub, and then hitting chef Stefano Riccioletti with her car and leaving him to die in the road as she drove home drunk.

'I know my actions shattered the hearts of his wife, his children, his friends and all who knew him,' the 20-year-old said, as she clutched pictures of her victim's children.

Tomica's blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit two hours after her arrest in January, according to the Miami Herald.

After smashing into her 49-year-old victim, the student drove away and ignored a witness who tried to flag her down.

When police arrested her in her 17th floor condo, Tomica had bits of her victim's brain and flesh in her hair.

In a statement that reduced the courtroom to tears, Tomica said: 'If my drinking at work and becoming 
drunk was not bad enough, killing Mr Stefano and driving away and 
leaving him to die was inexcusable.'

She added: 'I know my actions shattered the hearts 
of his wife, his children, his friends and all who knew him ... I broke the hearts of my parents.'

The former Florida International University student accepted a guilty plea to charges including DUI manslaugher and leaving the scene of a fatal accident.

The timing of the deal, just days before she turned 21, means Tomica will be treated as a youth offender, according to CBS Miami.

She will serve four years in prison, two years under house arrest and 15 years on probation.

Her driver's license was revoked for the rest of her life and a judge ordered the 20-year-old to complete more than 1,000 hours of community service and speak to students five times a year about how she killed Mr Riccioletti.

The family of the victim, who had three children aged 19, 12 and nine, is suing the Nikki Beach bar where Tomica had been working for negligence, in allowing an underage employee to drink.

The victim's wife, Patrizia Pesce, gave Tomica pictures of the couple's children as she explained in court the devastating effect losing their father had on them.

Their father, executive chef Mr Riccioletti, had been on his way to work when he was hit.

A witness described how the impact sent his body flying through the air, before it landed in the driveway of a hotel.

After seeing the accident, Jario Fuentes followed Tomica to her home as he tried to get her to pull over. The court heard she ignored him and went to her apartment where she was later arrested.

After refusing to take a Breathalyzer test at the time of arrest, Tomica then fell asleep in a chair at the police station.

Tomica could have faced more than 50 years in prison, but the widow of her victim intervened, saying her husband would not have wanted revenge, according to the Miami Herald.

Patrizia Pesce told her: 'He was a big believer in second chances. What will you do with this opportunity? Will you waste it or will you dedicate your life to improving the lives of others, not destroying them?'
