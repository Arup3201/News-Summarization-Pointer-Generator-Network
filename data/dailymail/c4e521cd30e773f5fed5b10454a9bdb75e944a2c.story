The families of two missing teenagers face an agonising few hours as they wait to hear whether two bodies found in a car used by the boys are theirs.

They were found on Sunday beneath a highway bridge in South Carolina, believed to be that of 18-year-old Jake Ziegler and 17-year-old Ray Pierce.

The bodies have not yet been positively identified but the car's licence plate matched one being used by the pair, who went missing two weeks ago as they traveled to Myrtle Beach.

The vehicle was spotted in marshy water under an Interstate 20 bridge in Kershaw County, S.C., around 4:30 p.m on Sunday, the Charlotte Observer reported.

Catawba County Sheriff Coy Reid told the newspaper the vehicle's occupants 'ran off the bridge or just in front of the bridge.'

He said the bodies hadn't been positively identified, but that the license plate matched that of the missing car.

Joe Pierce, Rayâ€™s father, said he was told of the grisly find while he was at the movies with his other children, trying to take their mind off their missing brother.

Fliers were posted by friends as they hunted for the missing teens

As they waited for more news he added his thanks to the community in helping to search for his son.

'That county did everything humanly they could,' he told the Charlotte Observer.

'I never saw such effort in my life than what these people did. Still, as each minute goes by, as each second goes by, you start to lose more and more hope.'

Desperate for clues about the teens' whereabouts, friends handed out fliers at a Carolina Panthers game, while Zig Ziegler, father of Jake, rented a helicopter to help search.

The boys' families now face an agonising wait to hear whether the bodies are theirs

They even hired a psychic who apparently said they had 'seen' the missing cars in an overturned car in a desolet area, the Observer reported.

However it has not been confirmed what led searchers to the particular stretch of I-20 late on Sunday.

They were combing the general area because that is were the final text message, sent by Ziegler, came from, 90 minutes after they left Catawba County.
