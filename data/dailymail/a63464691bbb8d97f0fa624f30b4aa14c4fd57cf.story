A homeless man could help unlock the disappearance of schoolgirl Alice Gross.

Police have been searching for the tramp who had been living on a railway embankment close to where the 14-year-old was last spotted 13 days ago.

His makeshift home was one of a number of locations examined by officers and sniffer dogs in Hanwell, west London, yesterday.

A neighbour said: ‘There’s somebody, 
probably a tramp, and it looked like they had been living on the 
embankment so they had to do a full search.’

Murder
 squad detectives have brought in dozens of extra officers to scour a 
grid of streets between Alice’s £850,000 home and the Grand Union Canal.

Alice, who has anorexia, went missing after she went out and 
failed to return home to Hanwell, leaving her family 
distraught and Scotland Yard detectives baffled.

Her
 sister Nina Gross, 19, said on TV on Monday night: 'It's hard because I miss
 her. And I just really hope she knows that we really, really love her -
 and we really need her back, because we love her.’

Her mother Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, told BBC London: 'Alice is an amazing daughter. She's smart, she's 
kind, she's funny, she's incredibly creative and talented. She's just an
 amazing daughter.'

And Alice's father Jose Gross, 60, said: 'I miss the sound of her voice - it's a 
really, really big part of our family and there's a massive hole now. We
 really need her back as soon as possible.’

Also on Monday, a
 51-year-old man arrested by detectives trying to discover the fate of 
Alice was released from custody, and told he will face no 
further action over the disappearance of the girl.

An unconnected 25-year-old man, who was arrested and held after a 
tip-off at the weekend, remained in custody. The disappearance continues
 to stump a team of top police investigators.

Detectives
 say they are conducting a missing person inquiry but have thrown the 
resources of a full murder investigation at the mystery.

Their
 focus remains a half-mile stretch of canal a short distance from her 
home in Hanwell, where she was last seen at 4.23pm on 
August 28.

A team of frogmen
 have sealed off a half-mile stretch of the Grand Union Canal which has 
murky, litter-strewn waters around 6ft deep.

The centre of the search is close to where the canal joins the River Brent and where Alice’s rucksack was discovered last Thursday.

Police declined to reveal whether they have traced her treasured iPhone, but it is understood the device has been switched off.

Specialist forensic officers have also conducted searches at two homes linked to the 51-year-old suspect.

Both are located on streets which may have been close to her route on foot between the canal and her home.

The
 teenager was captured by a CCTV camera at a nearby lock as she walked 
in the direction of her home on the afternoon of August 28.

Her family have revealed Alice, a talented musician, had been going through a ‘tough time’ as she battled anorexia.

But they had no reason to expect she would not come home for dinner and have been left devastated by her disappearance.

Police have questioned many of her worried friends at Brentside High School where she was a popular and successful student.

They
 are also examining many of her postings on social media, which include 
dozens of ‘selfie’ photographs and several intimate videos.

Alice,
 who weighed just 6st, was a prolific user of controversial website 
Ask.fm, which was at the centre of a cyberbullying storm last year.

Police are continuing to appeal to five cyclists seen riding past Alice on the day she vanished to get in touch

The
 schoolgirl answered many questions from anonymous users on the site, 
including many of a deeply personal nature, including potential 
boyfriends, sex, weight and her appearance.

The
 schoolgirl was also a prolific user of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, 
Skype and the messaging application Kik, a rival to Snapchat.

A
 Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force continues to appeal to 
five cyclists seen riding past Alice on the day she vanished to get in 
touch. He said: ‘This remains a missing person investigation.’

Surrey and Sussex Police have both provided specialist resources to the Met to help their search.
