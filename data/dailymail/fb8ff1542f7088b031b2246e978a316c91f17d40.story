Pat Schuerman, 50, says she no longer leaves the house because insecurities over her  psoriasis have left her feeling 'hideous' and like a 'leper'

A woman has described how unsightly patches of silvery 'bark' are forming all over her body as a result of the skin condition psoriasis.

Pat Schuerman, 50, is covered in thick, red welts and rough, silvery scales, which she described as 'looking like bark' or 'plaster of Paris'. 

She is constantly itching and feels 'hideous', but despite trying a range of treatments to help manage her condition, nothing has worked.

She now no longer leaves the house due to her insecurities, and has also developed arthritis in her joints - a problem related to her skin condition - making walking painful.

Her insecurities grew after she was thrown out a library and swimming pool due to psoriasis, which also affects celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, LeAnne Rimes and The Only Way Is Essex's Jessica Wright.

'I was asked to leave our local library because people complained I was getting flakes on the keyboard,' Miss Schuerman from Arizona, U.S., said.

'They thought I might be contagious and wouldn't let me back without a letter from a doctor.

'Then one day, I built enough courage to go swimming, but within seconds of stepping out the changing rooms I was told I couldn't get in the water.

'I'm treated like a modern-day leper so now I barely leave the house.'

According to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, 125 million people worldwide — 2 to 3 per cent of the total global population — have psoriasis.

It is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.

It occurs when the process by which the body produces skin cells is accelerated.

Normally the cells are replaced by the body every three to four months, but in psoriasis the process only lasts about three to seven days.

The resulting build-up of skin cells creates the silvery, bark-like patches that Miss Schuerman suffers.

It is believed this happens as the immune system attacks healthy skin cells by mistake.

Miss Schuerman first noticed the symptoms of the condition in her early 20s, when her skin began to become dry and flaky, with patches appearing, and she had excessive dandruff.

'Even the dandruff shampoo I'd been using hadn't helped,' she said.

'I was only 24 and took pride in my appearance. But most days I looked like I'd stepped out of a snow storm.'

'It was getting worse by the day. The psoriasis was spreading.'

Taking her clothes off was a nightmare, as her skin came away as she pulled off the garment.

'I inched my sock down my leg and peeled the top layer of my skin off with it,' she said.

'Day by day, my body was slowly being swallowed up by a thick covering of scales and sores, even between my fingers and toes.'

She was finally diagnosed at age 24, but diagnosis brought little relief as there is no cure for the condition.

'The doctor explained it's a skin condition that can cause flaky red patches of skin covered with silvery scales,' Miss Schuerman said.

'They told me there was no cure but that most people are only affected in small areas so it would be manageable with creams and medication.'

Miss Schuerman says the silvery patches look like bark or plaster of Paris. She suffers constant itching, and has difficulty taking on and off her clothes because they stick to her skin, causing sores. Her legs are pictured, right and left

'The itching drives me crazy,' she continued. 'My skin is so dry and brittle that my constant scratching leaves me red and bleeding.

'Even though I slather myself in moisturising cream in the morning, by evening I have to peel my clothes away from my skin, where they've welded themselves to my weeping wounds.

'The affected bits looked like thick bark or as if I'd been covered in plaster of Paris.'

She has tried an array of treatments to reduce her symptoms, but claims nothing has worked.

'It's on my legs, arms and torso,' Miss Schuerman said.

'It's even between my fingers and toes. It's hideous. I've tried creams, tablets and UV light treatment but nothing's made any difference.

'I even bathed in tar because someone said it would help. It didn't.'

She said the physical pain she endures from the psoriasis is nothing compared to the insecurities the condition has left her with.

As well as the library and swimming pool, she has been thrown out of bars, shops and restaurants.

Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.

The patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back but can appear anywhere on the body.

Around two per cent of the UK population, 1.8million people, are affected by the condition, which can start at any age.

For most, psoriasis develops before the age of 35 and the condition affects men and women equally. 

The severity of the condition varies from person to person, for some causing a minor irritation, while for others it has a major impact on their quality of life. 

The condition develops when the body's immune system starts to attack healthy skin cells. Normally the cells are replaced by the body every three to four months, but in psoriasis the process only lasts about three to seven days. File picture

Psoriasis is a long-lasting, or chronic, condition that involves periods when a sufferer will have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by more severe outbreaks.

The condition occurs when the process by which the body produces skin cells is accelerated.

Normally the cells are replaced by the body every three to four months, but in psoriasis the process only lasts about three to seven days.

The resulting build-up of skin cells creates the patches associated with psoriasis.

While the condition is not fully understood, it is thought the increased production of skin cells is related to a problem with a person's immune system.

For those suffering with the condition, their immune system attacks healthy skin cells by mistake.

Psoriasis can run in families and there is thought to be a genetic element to the condition.

Many sufferers will experience symptoms following a certain event, a trigger.

A trigger can include injury to a person's skin, throat infections and using certain medications.

The condition is not contagious, so cannot be spread from person to person.

There is no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can be used to improve symptoms and the appearance of the affected skin patches.

In most cases a sufferer will be prescribed creams and ointments to ease the symptoms.

If these prove ineffective, doctors may opt for phototherapy treatment. It involves exposing the skin to certain types of ultraviolet light.

In the most severe cases, systemic treatments are used. They are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the body.

'I couldn't take it anymore, so I stopped going out,' she said. 'I developed psoriatic arthritis so walking became almost impossible anyway.'

Between 10 and 30 per cent of people who have psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis, according to studies, as both are caused by inflammation.

Inflammation causes the joints to swell and become painful, sometimes restricting movement

Recently, Miss Schuerman's long-held fears about the psoriasis spreading to her face have become a reality.

'Last month I noticed a patch of dry skin by my eyebrow,' she said.

'I live in constant fear of being swallowed up by my skin condition forever. It's like I'm turning into a tree.'

However, despite having to battle insecurities and physical pain, Miss Schuerman remains positive.

'I know what's on the inside of a person, not the outside, that counts,' she said.

'I hope others will come to understand that too, and accept me for who I am, not judge.'
