Two job: Alan Yentob said his £183,000 was less than he would otherwise get

His pair of six-figure pay deals at the BBC have earned him the nickname ‘Two Jobs’ from his colleagues.

But Alan Yentob has defended his generous remuneration, saying: ‘It’s not a double salary, it’s half a salary.’

The 66-year-old earns £183,000 as the corporation’s creative director and a second pay packet, thought to be around £150,000, for presenting the Imagine arts series.

But he said the only reason people criticise his role is because he is ‘easy to take the p*** out of’.

‘I’ve been here for a long time, I’ve run all the channels, people have heard of me. I sound like I have famous friends, I’m easy to take the p*** out of,’ he told The Guardian.

'Every day I walk through the streets, I don’t see that resentment - only from certain bits of the press, I think.'

‘Let’s look at this double salary thing. If you look at my salary for the executive role it’s half what you would expect it to be. I’ve got a relatively thick skin. I have to put up with it. I know from my colleagues that they like working with me and there’s no hierarchical feel with me.’

On top of his total earnings of around £330,000, Mr Yentob – who has been at the BBC since 1968 – is believed to have a pension pot worth £6million.

He has repeatedly argued the BBC is right to pay its stars high salaries to allow it to compete with its commercial rivals.

And in his latest interview, he said the same principle meant the publicly funded organisation should not always be transparent about the way it operates.

He said: ‘[The BBC] can’t compete with its hands tied behind its back and being told: "You can’t pay the talent this and you’ve got to disclose everything you do". The BBC has to be as open as it can possibly be but it also has to be able to operate.’

Mr Yentob added: ‘[Television] is increasingly a global industry. What the BBC does for Britain and can do for Britain, if that is to be sustained it needs to be funded adequately.'

When asked about the string of recent crises at the BBC – from the Jimmy Savile scandal to the £100million Digital Media Initiative fiasco – he responded said people needed to be given credit for 'owning up'.

Despite his defensive stance, Mr Yentob did admit the BBC is currently failing in one area: the number of women and ethnic minorities it puts on air.

He said: ‘We’ve got more of an issue on-screen and we’re trying to address it.'
