Kenny McDowall has apologised to the Rangers support after commencing his tenure as caretaker manager with a humiliating 4-0 defeat by Hibs at Easter Road.

With Ally McCoist placed on gardening leave after tendering his resignation, McDowall prepared the players for Saturday’s Championship match but there was no improvement in performance as the team lost its fourth away fixture in succession.

Early goals from David Gray and Jason Cummings saw Hibs sprint into a two-goal lead within 12 minutes, before Scott Robertson and Liam Craig extended the margin of victory in the second half as Rangers were comprehensively outplayed.

‘Going two down after 12 minutes is not an ideal start,’ said McDowall. ‘All the work we had done on the training ground during the week went up in the air.

‘I would like to apologise to the support. I am very disappointed with the performance. I don’t have any excuses for you — Hibs were the better team and deserved to win the game.’

The drubbing leaves Rangers 15 points adrift of league leaders Hearts, who moved further clear in their bid to claim the one automatic promotion spot thanks to a 1-0 win at Livingston.

Rangers’ best hope of making it to the Premiership would appear to be via the play-offs, where Hibs are likely opponents.

‘We’ve just got to keep trying to win games and see where it takes us,’ continued McDowall. ‘If it’s a play-off, we’re prepared to go there.’

McDowall admitted he had substituted midfielder Ian Black after just 33 minutes as the former Hearts midfielder was already on a booking and looking liable to be sent off.

He admitted his players’ organisation had been poor and also conceded that the performance was the worst produced since Walter Smith took him to Ibrox in 2007.

‘I’m not sure I’ve had as heavy a defeat as that in my time so it’s disappointing,’ he said. ‘I don’t know if lack of commitment is the right phrase, they just lacked a wee bit of organisation. They let themselves down in terms of where they should have been on the park.

‘Commitment? You should ask them maybe.’

McDowall, who has been installed until the end of the season, admits the turbulence created by McCoist’s exit, combined with the ongoing off-field uncertainty, was taking its toll on the players.

’I couldn’t deny that the goings-on have not helped the situation,’ he added. ‘Do I want to make that an excuse? No. We are professional people, the lot of us. I will take responsibility — I set the team up. I’m sure he boys will take responsibility for their performances, too.

‘It wasn’t good enough on the day, Hibs were the better team. We’ve got Dumbarton next week and I’ll just need to try and get the players in and ready for that.’
