Fears are growing for the safety of part of the Elgin marbles loaned to Russia, as British museum trustees admitted they were worried the sculpture might not come back.

The unveiling of the headless statue of Greek river-god Ilissos at the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg yesterday prompted a furious diplomatic row with Greece.

But Dr Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, responded by claiming the Greek authorities had never formally asked for the sculptures to be returned, let alone requested to borrow them.

The choice of Russia as the first recipient of an Elgin statue sparked further controversy given tensions between the Kremlin and the West over Ukraine and the Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash.

Patience Wheatcroft, one of the British Museum's trustees, admitted that when the board discussed the loan some were concerned the piece might not come back.

'There is always a risk that someone will do something untoward. But we decided that it was a very unlikely event and that there would be sufficient pressure to ensure that the object was returned. It was a unanimous decision and we were absolutely united,' she told The Telegraph.

The statue's unexpected move from the British Museum came after a journey cloaked in secrecy for security and to ensure maximum impact.

Maurice Davies, partner at the Museum Consultancy and former head of policy at the UK's Museum Association said 'it was a very bold risk'.

He warned that the decision could 'easily backfire' because of the worsening relations between Russia and the West.

But he said it also showed the possibility of cultural co-operation and shows there are 'alternatives to war and national power'.

Prime Minister David Cameron expressed confidence over the sculpture's future amid fears that Number 10's frosty diplomatic relations with Vladimir Putin could impact its return.

He said there was 'trust' and a 'working relationship' between the museums involved.

Sir Richard Lambert, Chairman of The Trustees of the British Museum, said the loan was only approved 16 days ago as they wanted to 'leave room for flexibility if the political relationship between Europe and Russia changed'.

The Prime Minister of Greece, Antonis Samaras, once again accused Britain of 'looting' and said the decision to lend the statue to Russia 'provokes the Greek people'.

But Dr MacGregor from the British Museum pointed out that Greece has never actually asked for them back.

'The Greek claim to the Marbles is a political question,' he said. 'What's clear is that the Greek position on the sculpture is the government's. It's not a position that comes out of an academic or conservation issue,' he told The Times.

'The Greek government has never asked the trustees of the British Museum for the return [of the Marbles]. It's always been done through the media or through someone else.' It had also 'never asked to borrow' them.'

The 2,500-year-old sculptures were removed from the Parthenon in Athens by Lord Elgin in the 19th century.

Since the late actress-turned-politician Melina Mercouri launched the restitution campaign in the 1980s, numerous attempts to win back the Marbles have failed.

Leading state archaeologists and culture ministry officials asked to borrow the Marbles before the 2004 Athens Olympics, for the duration of the Games.

In exchange Britain was offered its pick of 32,000 statues and vases dating back to the 5th century BC, and co-operation with the Acropolis Museum, but the offer was rejected.

Officials in Athens say they were offered permanent loan in exchange for complete resignation of ownership rights to the Marbles. The proposition was discussed but no deal was ever reached.

This year Athens hired lawyer Amal Clooney for a legal fight and she said Greece had 'just cause' for the return of the marbles.

The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants.

The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce,  removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803.

In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon.

As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site. 

His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000.

The scupltures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism.

They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum.

They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery.

 Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail.

In February, while attending the Berlin Film Festival to promote The Monuments Men, George Clooney was asked by a Greek journalist whether Britain should allow Greece to reclaim its historic art.

He replied: 'You have a very good case. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.'

Amal Alamuddin Clooney's law firm Doughty Street chambers yesterday confirmed that she had travelled to Athens, where she will remain until Thursday, at the invitation of the Greek government.

Her visit is 'in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British museum', it said.

The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal.

However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognizable.
