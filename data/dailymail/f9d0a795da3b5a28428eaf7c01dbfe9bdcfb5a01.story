Like many other Americans, AT&T is gearing up for the highly-anticipated iPhone 5 launch next month, moving to counter the flood of demand for the device.

The iPhone 5 is set to be 
unveiled during an Apple press conference in San Francisco on September 12 and go on sale just weeks 
later.

Apple's last iPhone model, the 4S - which introduced voice recognition system Siri, a new camera and a faster operating system - was introduced in October 2011.

Sources at AT&T told BGR.com that the carrier is planning ahead for the release, putting an â€˜all hands on deck' order in place from mid-September to mid-October.

A separate source told the website that a regional training session slated for the first week of October has now been pushed back.

The new iPhone is expected to have a larger 4 inch screen and a more powerful battery than current models.

Some
tech insiders believe the iPhone 5 will have a rounder, curvier look 
than the 4S. Others say it's unlikely that Apple will go back to the 
rounded 'look' it abandoned before.

It is also believed to be so the new handset can include LTE, a high speed '4G data network giving far faster speeds than current iPhones.

Other rumours surrounding the iPhone point to a larger 4-inch display at a resolution of 1,136 x 640, along with a new two-tone back panel.

While the iPhone 5 launch is highly anticipated, Apple has also come under fire over reports of a smaller dock connector that would force owners to buy an adapter for use with their current dock.

It was revealed last week that Apple was trying to boost its declining sales by matching the $50 discount currently offered by Sprint on all models of the iPhone, dropping the price of the iPhone 4S drops to $150  from $200 when you sign a two-year contract.

A 32GB goes down to $250, 64GB too $350 and the iPhone 4 goes right down to $50.

But you won't find the offer 
advertised anywhere. This is one of those rare occasions when it's not 
who you know, but what you know that counts.

The discount will only be applied if you mention the Sprint sale, at which point $50 drops off the total bill.

And it doesn't apply online either, only in store.

Rumours about the technology giant are not exactly rare, but this one, first reported by MacRumours, is for real.

In fact it's likely it was started by Apple itself, in a bid to boost sales after rumours of the soon-to-be-released iPhone 5 saw sales slump.

Would-be-buyers are thought to have put their credit on hold to await the arrival of the next-generation phone, thought to be announced in mid-September.
