This is the moment a wallaby was caught on camera hopping around Highgate Cemetery.

At first, the footage seems to be a normal shot of the famous graveyard - the burial site of numerous famous figures including Karl Marx.

But if you look closely, you can see the creature standing by one of the graves staring right at the camera.

Unexpected: A wallaby has been filmed hopping around Highgate Cemetery in north London

Spotted! In this wider shot, the animal can be seen staring directly into the camera while it stops by a grave

After a little while, the tame animal hops off to adventure round some of the 53,000 graves in the cemetery.

The footage, taken on Monday, then continues to follow the wallaby while it skulks around, hopping between the bushes and around gravestones of the westerly area of the cemetery.

The creature goes on quite the tour - and explores a fair amount of the English Heritage registered site.

Eventually, it hops off down a gravel road and out of site.

Visitor and volunteer coordinator Melanie Winyard said someone first saw the marsupial, which belongs to the same family as the kangeroo, on Sunday.

She said: 'It’s quite extraordinary and so 
unexpected.

'The West Cemetery is quite secure so it’s a 
mystery how he got in there but now he’s in, it’s quite a good place to 
be as he won’t be crossing the roads.'

Maurice Melzak, a documentary maker who lives next door to the cemetery, 
heard about the unexpected visitor.

Adventure: The marsupial then hops off to have a peak around some of the 53,000 graves at the burial site

Mr Melzak, who is also a zoologist, managed to film the creature for around two minutes.

He said: 'I live right next to the cemetery and when I heard there was a wallaby I was straight round.

'I saw some pictures that visitors had taken during the day on Sunday but I didn't see the animal myself.

'I went back the next day and there it was - hopping around. It was extraordinary.

'It is quite odd. Apparently they do live in packs wild across the country, however strange that seems.

'I don't think it is alone either. I later saw a wallaby but it looked different somehow - so perhaps there are two of them. I can't be sure though.

'I heard someone had seen a wallaby in the park too.'

Visit: The animal, seen next to the tree in this shot, was first spotted on Sunday by visitors to the English Heritage site who took pictures of the unusual event

Extraordinary: Mr Melzak said the wallaby's visit was odd - and that he thought it may not have been alone

Last week, a man claims to have seen a wallaby in Fitzroy Park, near Hampstead Heath, also in Highgate.

Edmund King managed to take a blurry photo of the creature before it ran away.

Mr Melzak said he contacted numerous local zoos - and none of them were missing a wallaby.

Nearby Golders Hill Park Zoo homes wallabies but a spokesperson said that none of their animals had escaped in recent years.

London Zoo in Regent’s Park also confirmed that none of their animals had escaped.

Not alone: The sighting follows news that another wallaby was seen on Hampstead Heath last week

I'm off: Eventually, the creature makes its way down a gravel path and out of site

The City of London Corporation, which runs the Heath, said that there had been no official reports of wallaby sightings.

A spokesperson said: 'We haven’t spotted any wallabies though there may be a few Australians lurking around.

'We’ve had no unusual sightings in recent times so it seems this is a case like the Loch Ness monster, more imagined than actual reality.'

Wallabies belong to the same family as kangaroos, though they are much smaller, and are native to Australia.
