A leading child therapist who has appeared on the Dr. Phil show has been arrested on a child cruelty charge.

Karen Corcoran Walsh is alleged to have left her 11-year-old step daughter home alone after storming out of her Florida home following an argument with her husband.

When contacted on the phone she is alleged to have refused to return to the house to take care of the child telling a security guard to call the girl's father.

Walsh, who runs the Inspiration for Youth and Families Center which helps teens addicted to drugs, was arrested on child abuse charges.

The 51-year-old later told local media she was the victim of wrongful arrest and her lawyer said he hoped the charge would be dropped.

According to a police report the incident began after Walsh and her husband Christopher had an argument at their home.

During the row Walsh broke her husband's cell phone and told him to leave the house. After he left, Walsh also walked out leaving her step daughter alone in the gated community.Â

The arrest report said the girl was 'scared, when she walked out of the bedroom to find herself home alone.

'She had no cell phone, no house phone, no house key or no note left saying where her mother had left to. (The girl) explained she left the home unlocked and proceeded to walk down the road to the guard gate barefoot. The road was very dark and unsafe for a child to walk at night alone.'

The guard called Boca Raton Police who located Karen Walsh and placed her under arrest - charging her with 'Neglect of a Child.'

Walsh later posted $3,000 bond.

In an interview with the Sun Sentinel newspaper she denied any wrongdoing.

'There was no wrongdoing on my part, and I would really like my name to be cleared,' Karen Walsh said.

'I did the best that I could in this 
situation and that's it. Unfortunately, I feel that the investigation 
was not thorough and had they given it its due time, they would have 
found that there was no wrongdoing on my part.'

Walsh, a former teacher, is known for her work with troubled children.

Her fame led her to being invited on to the Dr. Phil where she talked about her work with teens and addiction treatment.

With her husband she also owns an adult therapy treatment center in Fort Lauderdale.

Walsh's attorney, Leah Mayersohn, said she's working with the police to resolve the issue and have the charges dropped.

'Why they arrested Karen is absolutely beyond me,' Mayersohn said. 'She certainly extricated herself from a situation that could potentially have been escalating, which was the right thing to do under those circumstances.'

She said the child was left alone in a safe, gated community for 20 minutes or less, and that Karen and Christopher Walsh each thought she was with the other.

Mayersohn said Walsh's arrest could affect her future ability to work with troubled children.

'She provides very valuable services to children and to adults in Florida who have suffered these issues,' she said, 'and this is a really terrible accusation.'
