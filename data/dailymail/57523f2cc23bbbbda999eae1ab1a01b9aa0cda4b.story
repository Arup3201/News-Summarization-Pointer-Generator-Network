Jose Mourinho may have been full of praise for Bradford after the League One side knocked Chelsea out of the FA Cup on Saturday, but that didn't stop him from mistakenly referring to them as 'Barnsley'.

Bradford shocked Mourinho's side by coming back from a 2-0 deficit to earn an historic 4-2 victory at Stamford Bridge, and although the defeat will stick in the Portuguese manager's memory, it would seem he'd forgotten their name shortly after the final whistle.

When asked if he had underestimated the League One side with his team selection, Mourinho needed the help of Chelsea's director of communications Steve Atkins to correctly pronounce Bradford.

The 51-year-old said: 'Today the priority was the FA Cup and the fact that we didn't play with our best team or our best players is not a way to say we didn't carry the competition. We did carry the competition.

'Is there any player in Barnsley... How do you say? No, their team? Bradford.

'Is there any Bradford player that can play for Chelsea with all due respect? No.

'The selection was good. The players should obviously have won this game.

Perhaps Mourinho can be forgiven for still being in shock following the result which saw a strike before half-time from Jon Stead followed by goals from Filipe Morais and Andy Halliday put the Bantams ahead before Mark Yeates confirmed their progress in injury time.

Jose Mourinho isn't the first foreign import to get things a bit muddled when referring to opposing teams...

Earlier this season, Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal seemed to be a bit hungry when discussing his side's Premier League clash against Southampton.

He said: 'They (Southampton) played in the same play style as Queens Park Raisins.'

Belgian winger Eden Hazard also got lost in translation when attempting to discuss Cheslea's Capital One Cup victory against Shrewsbury Town.

He said: I was on the bench for the game against Strawberry.'
