He was Queen Elizabeth's I's spymaster, protector and the deeply-Protestant man bent on crushing all those who supported the Pope in Rome.

But 500 years on it appears a cunning plot by a subversive Catholic artist may have been uncovered - because below a priceless portrait of Sir Francis Walsingham lies a secret image of the Virgin Mary holding a baby Christ.

The painting, which may also contain a sketch of Joseph or an angel, is from the 1580s and created at the height of Walsingham's powers, while he served as the Tudor queen's lord treasurer and secretary.

Hundreds were burned, hanged or beheaded at the fervent priest-hunter's say-so, including Mary Queen of Scots when he uncovered the plot to place her on the English throne in 1587.

Uncovered: Queen Elizabeth's Protestant enforcer Sir Francis Walsingham's portrait has been scanned, which has uncovered a secret sketch put there by a Catholic sympathiser

Hidden: Running over Walsingham's face is the outline of what appears to be the Virgin Mary and Christ

At the time England was openly backing a war in the Netherlands against enemy Catholic Spain and Sir Francis was using his huge network of spies across the country and Europe to protect the Queen from the threat of Rome.

Aide: Walsingham was one of Queen Elizabeth's right-hand men and also her treasurer and secretary in the 16th century

However, a five-year study into Tudor art by the National Portrait Gallery in London has found an important portrait of him contains hidden images, uncovered after it was hit with infra-red reflectography and X-rays.

This technique has allowed the images to be seen underneath layers of paint without disturbing the main works

'He would not have been delighted,' gallery expert Dr Tarnya Cooper said, adding: 'the Protestant spymaster with the Roman Catholic
image of the virgin and child beneath, you do wonder if the artist 
might be enjoying a private joke at the expense of the sitter.

'The Catholics are the absolute enemy at this period so the idea that you’ve got this wonderful devotional image underneath your portrait would probably be rather horrifying to him.

'There is not very much that Walsingham does not know about of what’s going on in courts across Europe, he has a huge network of informers, is an incredibly wily man and is someone with a public reputation. For somebody who is not wonderfully keen on Walsingham this would be a clever way of getting at him.

'It is intriguing that it is under the spy-master general'.

Walsingham was not the only victim as a version of The Flagellation of Christ has been found on the canvas 
underneath a portrait of Thomas Sackville, the Tudor statesman and poet.

The portrait of Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, is dated 1601, by 
an unknown artist. The underlying image of the flagellation is believed 
to be based on an engraving of the work, which first appeared on a 
fresco in the Borgherini Chapel in Rome by Sebastiano del Piombo after 
designs by Michelangelo.

Recycling? This portrait of poet Thomas Sackville from 1601 was also looked at and it revealed an image of Christ below, which could be deliberate or a recycled background

As 120 canvasses were scanned for secret images and only two were found to be hiding something, the gallery says it is likely the pair were targeted.

He was Elizabeth I's priest-hunter who dedicated his life to protecting his country as leader of a fervent anti-catholic cause.

Known as a master spy, he infiltrated Catholic pockets in England and abroad and built up a huge network of contacts.

He was famous for using fear and paranoia as a weapon against Rome, and anyone suspected of being a threat to the country was killed, without exception.

At the time there were several perceived threats to the Queen's reign, especially from Spain, and he killed many to stop it.

His most famous moment came when he discovered Mary Queen of Scots was being lined up in a papist plot which led to her being beheaded at Fotheringhay in 1587.

There are also other famous examples of artists hiding pictures below artwork.

Goya's painting of a French general was found under his drawing of Spanish judge Don Ramon Satue at a Dutch gallery, with experts sure that it was painted over for political reasons.

And the 16th century Gerolamo Bassano painting called The Sepulchre, kept in Washington DC, was x-rayed at a local hospital, which discovered there was a portrait of a man in Tudor costume holding his own waist.

Some of these secret sketches may also be an example of the artists being thrifty and recycling canvasses or wood to form the piece of art.

“It has been really exciting to discover these images beneath portraits.
The re-use of wooden panels is an example of Tudor recycling, which was
an essential part of life in the past. And yet, the people in the 
portraits painted over the top were perhaps unlikely to have known the 
panels were second-hand,' Dr Cooper said.

The works go on display this week in an exhibition, Hidden: Unseen Paintings Beneath Tudor Portraits. Visitors are also shown the X-ray images alongside copies of the concealed paintings.
