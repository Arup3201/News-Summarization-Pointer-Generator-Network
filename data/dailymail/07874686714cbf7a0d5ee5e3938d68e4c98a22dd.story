Speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting an early birth has been quashed after it emerged that Prince William plans to play in a charity polo match on Sunday, the Mail can reveal.

The father-to-be will take part in the game at Cirencester Polo Club in Gloucestershire but he will not be accompanied by his heavily pregnant wife. She will not want to leave her London ‘safety zone’ so close to her due date.

Kate herself let slip earlier this year that their baby was due in mid-July, a fact which has since been confirmed by palace officials.

In recent weeks there has been increasing speculation, however, that the public had been misled and the new third in line to the throne was due earlier, even though it was vehemently denied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s spokesman.

Now palace aides have confirmed that William has committed to playing in the Jerudong Trophy match at the Cotswolds club this weekend, an annual event which raises thousands of pounds for charities he supports.

This was corroborated by another well-placed source, who said the prince had changed his mind several times about whether to attend.  But as of today he was ‘definitely’ confirmed – ‘or as definitely as you can with a baby on the way’, the source joked.

William’s decision suggests that he is now more confident that his first-born is not about to make an appearance this week.

‘Initially his office said yes, then said no, and have now confirmed that he will be playing,’ the source said.

‘I think he was torn as, clearly, he wants to be with his wife at such an important time, but was all too aware how much the event raises for charities he is passionate about.’

Fortunately the polo ground is a manageable 94 mile, two hour trip - largely on motorway - back to London, should he suddenly receive a call from Kate.

In that event, it is likely he will make the journey with a police escort, meaning he could make it back to the capital in little over an hour.

The Duchess is currently dividing her time between their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where she is busy making final preparations for her baby’s birth as well as overseeing the redecoration of their new 20-room apartment in the main building, and her parents’ mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire. 

Carole Middleton is likely to be at her daughter’s side should William struggle to make the birth in time.

William will be joined at Sunday’s game by his brother, Prince Harry, another able polo player.

The two brothers will be raising funds for Child Bereavement UK, which supports families and educates professional when a child dies or when a child is bereaved, and the youth homelessness organisation Centrepoint. William is patron of both charities.

They will also be supporting WellChild, another charity of which Harry is patron.

A Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed to the Mail that the prince intended to play polo this weekend, unless his wife went into labour.

‘The Duke will play at Cirencester on Sunday if he can and obviously he won't if he can't,’ he said.

‘The charities benefiting are Child Bereavement UK, Centrepoint and WellChild. ‘

Desperate to be a ‘hands-on’ dad, William has made clear he is determined to make his son or daughter’s birth ‘by hook or by crook’.

The Mail revealed earlier today that he even has a helicopter on stand-by in the garden of his Welsh farmhouse this week in case Kate’s waters break while he is on duty as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot.

William’s father, Prince Charles, broke royal tradition when he was present at the birth of both his sons.

Prince Philip, however, played squash with his friend and private secretary, Michael Parker, while the Queen – then Princess Elizabeth - was in labour with Prince Charles, although he took her champagne and carnations when it was all over.
