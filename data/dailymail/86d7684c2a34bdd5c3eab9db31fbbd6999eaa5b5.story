The great thing for Roma fans is that their manager Rudi Garcia hasn’t just found Francesca Brienza — he has found Jesus!

Brienza, the Serie A club’s in-house TV presenter, in theory, should be out of bounds. But Roma’s French manager isn’t a great man for boundaries.

En route to coaching Italy’s capital club on Champions League duty at Manchester City this week, he has been a TV presenter, a physio, a scout and you can also see footage of him on television playing guitar and singing.

He sets his own rules and compares himself to Jose Mourinho.

No sooner was the 50-year-old in the door at Roma than he was causing ructions by banning those fans who turned up at the club’s Trigoria training ground.

He got there, in summer 2013, to find that absolutely anyone who was at the training ground — media, youth prospects, parents, scouts, agents, ground staff and probably some of the club’s notorious Ultras — were milling around getting in the way of the 20-odd players who were supposed to be bringing back the glory days.

If Roma’s strikers can hit the net with the same accuracy as Garcia used in booting their backsides out of what is now ‘his’ domain, then look out Serie A.

So, to another part of his domain, Brienza. She is a beautiful 28-year-old Roma TV presenter.

An Italian football newspaper thought they had a great splash when they snapped the coach and his club’s TV channel anchor at a romantic dinner together.

But, by the morning the scoop was published, the wind was rather stylishly taken out of their sails by Garcia and Brienza taking a joint ‘selfie’ and publishing a unified message on Twitter.

Francesca Brienza took to Twitter to explain how Rudi Garcia was very much a part of her 'private life'

There was wit in taking the ‘we’re-a-couple-leave-us-alone’ photo at Rome’s world-famous Coliseum.

When the Frenchman arrived at one of Europe’s great underachieving clubs, they had just lost the Coppa Italia a few weeks earlier to bitter city rivals Lazio.

Such was the bucolic reaction that when he and his new squad were presented at the Stadio Olimpico, he was whistled and booed into office.

‘Rudi who?’ was the sentiment.

But their rampaging 17-game unbeaten start to the Serie A season, the alluring football Roma played, the fact he convinced Daniele de Rossi not to join Manchester United and the fact that he and Roma icon Francesco Totti got on famously have all that led not only to acceptance, but reverence.

However, Roma didn’t have the necessary strength in depth to cope with injuries and the rigours of a long chase after the Juventus machine.

They finished second in the league and were knocked out of the cup by the winners, Rafa Benitez’s Napoli.

But Rudi has a dream and it involves Jesus — Jorge Jesus, that is, manager of Benfica.

The Lisbon giants were second in the Portuguese league, beaten finalists in the Europa League and beaten in their national cup final two seasons ago. But they stormed back the next year to win the title, the cup and reached the Europa League Final once again.

‘Benfica has to be our model — we have a stronger squad now and we can also go one step further,’ declared Garcia.

This was his message to fans, players and media alike at the beginning of this season.

Also, presumably, to owner James Pallotta — net worth over €1bn and managing director of Boston fund managers Raptor Group — given that there were new contracts for Miralem Pjanic and the now prolific Gervinho, plus the acquisition of several new signings including Seydou Keita, Ashley Cole, Kostas Manolas and Juan Manuel Iturbe.

Little wonder spirits are high after another thunderous winning start to the season, including going joint top of Serie A and that 5-1 thrashing of CSKA Moscow in the first Champions League group match.

Keita, already a winner of this competition with Barcelona, reckons: ‘I’ve come into a great squad and a unified dressing room. Rudi Garcia reminds me of Pep Guardiola. He wants us to dominate via possession. They have the same credo — results need to stem from good football.’
