There are pirates and princesses, fairy queens  and crocodiles... and the obligatory ragtag army of soap stars, reality celebs and comics.

After all, the annual pantomime season would hardly be complete without a sea of ‘famous’ faces imported from our television screens.

With Henry ‘The Fonz’ Winkler in Richmond, David Hasselhoff in Nottingham and Bonnie Langford in Guildford, it might seem that some of the stars treading the boards have lost their lustre.

Yet no one doubts they will have the last laugh when the curtain comes down – because the majority of this year’s entertainers look set to pocket six-figure sums over Christmas.

EastEnders actor Steve McFadden is understood  to be in line for a £200,000 cheque for his role as Captain Hook in Croydon, while talent show duo Ashleigh Butler and Pudsey will earn a cool £500,000 for two seasons playing in Dick Whittington – this year it’s at the Manchester Opera House.

It’s been a good business all round ever since the seasonal entertainment found its current form with shows including Puss In Boots 200 years ago.

Today, pantomimes earn millions in ticket sales – and their popularity shows no sign of waning with children and adults alike. Not to mention a legion of familiar faces who love nothing better than the chance to wave a magic wand over their pay packets – and, who knows, their careers.
