Sophie Jones, 31, believes her smoking habit played a part in the death of her son Korey, who was stillborn

A pregnant mother who smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day while pregnant believes her addiction claimed the life of her baby son. 

Sophie Jones gave birth to a stillborn son, Korey, in 2011.

The mother-of-five said she is racked with guilt, believing her smoking played a part in the death of her son. 

Her heartache at losing Korey was compounded by the fact her son Frankie died when he was four days old, from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, in 2006.

Despite this, she has smoked during every pregnancy except this one.

She claims she was unaware of the dangers her habit posed to her unborn babies.

'It is absolutely devastating to lose two children as you never expect that to happen,' she said.

'When I go to tidy up their graves I think I should be tidying their bedrooms not their gravesides.

'I think about them both everyday, but it's particularly sad at this time of year because on Christmas Day I think there should be two more piles of presents.' 

Mrs Jones, 31, was told she suffered a stillbirth because of damage caused to her placenta.

She said she believes the damage was the result of her smoking.

The housewife, who is 20 weeks pregnant with her sixth child, has quit her habit to protect her unborn daughter.

She said: 'I've experienced the worst possible heartache that no parent should have to go through.

'Losing my baby boy Korey as a stillbirth is one of my biggest regrets and continues to haunt me to this day.

'I never fully understood the risks of smoking while pregnant. I just thought it led to a smaller baby. 

'How wrong I was. I cut down when I fell pregnant, but obviously that wasn't enough to save my baby.'

Mrs Jones's son Frankie died four days after he was born in 2006 of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

While the 31-year-old does not know if his death was caused by her smoking, recent research by Durham University revealed the risk of SIDS increases if a parent smokes.

'I've always dreamed of a big family, so when I fell pregnant this time I was determined to quit for good,' said Mrs Jones, who is married to Alix, 27, a support worker.

'I visited Northumberland Stop Smoking Service where the advisers were just the best. 

'They gave me so much knowledge and support that I can't thank them enough for what they've done. 

'When they sat me down to explain how smoking could be depriving my unborn baby of oxygen I felt sick.

The mother-of-five, who is 20 weeks pregnant with a baby girl, has given up smoking to protect her unborn daughter. She said she was not aware of the dangers her addiction posed to her baby son, thinking smoking only resulted in a smaller baby. She urged other mothers-to-be to quit their habit to protect their babies

Every cigarette contains more than 4,000 chemicals, which can cause serious harm to an unborn baby.

Cigarettes can restrict the essential oxygen supply to a baby, forcing their heart to beat harder every time their mother smokes.

Stopping smoking will immediately benefit both the mother-to-be and their unborn baby.

Harmful gases, including carbon monoxide, will start to clear from the mother's body.

Smoking during pregnancy can aggravate the symptoms of morning sickness and increase the risk of stillbirth.

Mothers who quit smoking will cope better with birth and reduce the chances of their baby being born prematurely.

Babies born to smoking mothers are also on average 8oz (200g) lighter than other babies, leaving them more prone to infection.

Smoking during pregnancy also raises the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.

Quitting will also benefit a child's health later in life.

Children with parents who smoke are more prone to asthma and other serious illnesses. 

A study published in the British Medical Journal earlier this year warned that passive smoking also increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and ectopic pregnancy.

The more women are exposed to second hand smoke, the greater the risks.

They study found younger and better educated women were less likely to miscarry or have birth complications while women of black and minority ethnic backgrounds, and those who were overweight, were more likely to do so.

Compared to non-smokers, those who smoked during their reproductive years were 16 per cent more likely to miscarry, 44 per cent more likely to have a stillborn child, and 43 per cent more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy.

'To learn smoking could be damaging me and my unborn baby in this way was gutting. I made my mind up about quitting there and then. 

'I've now been quit for four months and I've never felt better. I no longer suffer from breathlessness and the money I've saved from not buying cigarettes has bought a new cot for the baby.

'All of my children are so proud of me for not smoking and tell me all the time how happy they are that I don't smell. 

'I'd encourage any mums-to-be who smoke to think about the risks to your baby and get support to quit. Don't wait to suffer like I did.'

Smoking is one of the biggest risks to the health of unborn babies, depriving them of vital oxygen and cutting off the supply of nutrients they need to grow properly.

It is estimated that 360 young lives are lost each year in the North East due to smoking-related miscarriages, with between 3,000 and 5,000 lost nationally. 

As well as being a major cause of stillbirth and premature birth, the poisons found in tobacco smoke can also increase the risk of cot death, birth defects and lead to a child developing behavioural problems in their early years.

Connie Reardon, stop smoking pregnancy specialist at Northumberland Stop Smoking Service, run by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are incredibly grateful for Sophie for being brave enough to share such an agonizing story in the hope more expectant and future mothers and their families can understand the harm that smoking can cause to your unborn baby.

'We know quitting is not easy and we can give the support to help expectant mothers to do it.

'There's now more proof than ever that smoking is dangerous – both for your unborn baby and you.

'And even if you've smoked through your pregnancy so far, it's not too late to stop as the benefits kick in straight away.

'We are not here to judge, we just want to help ladies to decide how to quit on their terms.

'We know you are four times more likely to quit with our support and nicotine replacement therapy is available free of charge for pregnant smokers.'
