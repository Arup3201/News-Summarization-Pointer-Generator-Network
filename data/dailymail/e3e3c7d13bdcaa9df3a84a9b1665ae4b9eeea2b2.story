Queens Park Rangers have joined the race to sign Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley. 

Boss Harry Redknapp is prepared to make his second raid of the summer on Old Trafford, having already signed the England midfielder's former team-mate Rio Ferdinand.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez is a huge fan of the 25-year-old England international and it is understood that Cleverley would jump at the chance of playing for a manager he previously worked with on loan at Wigan.

The stumbling block right now is that Everton say they do not have the money to sign Cleverley and fear that United will ask for significantly more than the £7million they were prepared to take from either Aston Villa or Hull City.

United have made it clear they do not want him to join a rival like Everton and there is also bad blood between Toffees chairman Bill Kenwright and Red Devils chief Ed Woodward over the bid to sign Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines last summer.

Villa would still appear to be in pole position if they can increase the personal terms on offer to Cleverley in order to persuade him to move to the Midlands, either permanently or on loan.

Time's up: Cleverley looks set to end his time at Old Trafford with a host of clubs chasing his signature
