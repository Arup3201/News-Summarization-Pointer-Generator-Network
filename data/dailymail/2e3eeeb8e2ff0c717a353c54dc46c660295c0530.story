A hospital chief who stole £43,548 from the NHS was caught out when police found a handwritten note which read, 'Total stolen from NHS- £33,750'.

Dean Evans, 41, who stole £43,548 worth of money and electrical goods from University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and was jailed for 18 months after admitting theft.

Evans, from who earned £35,000-a-year as a learning and technology manager with the trust, was arrested after police found a notebook in his home, where he had brazenly written a total of the amount he had stolen from the NHS.

Leicester Crown Court heard how Evans submitted false invoices to the hospital trust including £4,440 for two camera lenses and spent the money he stole on gambling trips to Las Vegas.

Evans also stole an iPod, Ipads and Macbook, totalling £24,000 and sold some of it on eBay earning himself £10,000.

Soon after starting his NHS job in 2010, Evans formed his own company, Promet Solutions Limited, which he registered as a supplier to the NHS - without indicating he was connected with it.

Promet Solutions was supposedly supplying services to the trust, including arranging conferences and obtaining sources of goods to be supplied to the NHS but he instead used to company to obtain money.

Evans even arranged for hospital library fines to be paid directly to his company, via credit cards, but never handed over the £182 obtained under the scheme to the trust.

Evans also spent £600 on a Christmas party for his staff, telling his team he was personally paying for it as a thank you - but instead he invoiced the trust for it as a 'conference deposit'.

Evans was sacked in October, 2011, following an investigation by the NHS Fraud Unit and has now been jailed for 18 months.

Sentencing Evans, Recorder Marcus Tregilgas-Davey said: 'The loss to the trust will impact upon the people of this city.

'It will have had an effect on some of the health services that the trust offers. That means individuals who rely on the trust for their healthcare and wellbeing will have been affected because the trust will have had to cancel or cut back certain services to make up for the £43,548 you stole.

'You knew what you were doing and police found a notebook where you wrote ‘Total stolen from NHS £33,750’.

'I accept you were building up debts and some money was to assist with finances, but some was also used to assist with what could be called lavish living.

'There were expensive electrical items, meals out and trips abroad including Las Vegas, involving gambling, and money paid to your son.'

Paul Tubb, mitigating, said Evans maintained there was an 'ingrained culture' of senior management putting on Christmas parties to boost staff morale, which was often funded by the NHS, by holding a conference followed by a party.

He said: 'He was a middle manager responsible for an individual who had six people working below her.'

Mr Tubb said Evans got into financial difficulty when his former partner left him 'out of the blue' and he struggled to meet his mortgage and credit card commitments.

After the case, Andrew Seddon, director of finance at the trust, said: 'Mr Dean Evans worked for the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust as the learning and technology manager from April 12, 2010, until October 31, 2011.

'Following allegations and a subsequent investigation, he was dismissed for gross misconduct.

'We have worked closely with NHS Counter Fraud and the police since the allegations came to light.

'We have changed a number of procedures and protocols as a result of our investigations, to ensure that something similar cannot happen in future.

'We are satisfied that justice has been served and the custodial sentence is reflective of the severity of fraud of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.'
