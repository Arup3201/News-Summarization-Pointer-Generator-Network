Parts of the giant statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin have gone on sale online after it was toppled by anti-Russian demonstrators in Ukraine last week.

The monument was pulled down on Sunday and still lies in Kharkiv's Freedom Square - but parts have started to go missing.

The ear and other parts from the Communist's 30ft effigy have cropped up on VK, the Russian version of Facebook, and are being sold to raise funds for anti-Russian forces.

The nose from Lenin's toppled statue in Kharkiv, Ukraine, is up for sale on the black market, as are the former Soviet Leader's ear and other body parts

Vitaly Kalinin claimed to have one of Lenin's large bronze ears, which he cut from the statue overnight.

He posted online: 'Come and listen to the sound of change - through Lenin's ear.'

One protester was seen taking the nose, which is 14in long, 14in wide and about 10in high, the night the statue was pulled down.

A seller, only identifying himself as Oleksiy, claims to have the nose and said: 'If there is anyone who says, "I am ready, let’s say, to provide a battalion of soldiers with winter underwear and uniforms," then we will give him [the nose].

'That is, if no one says, better yet, that he’s ready to provide two battalions with the things I have mentioned.'

Local police - heavily criticised in Russia for doing nothing to stop the statue's destruction - have yet to open an inquiry. 

Protestors scaled the monument, carved 'Glory to Ukraine' into it and sawed off its legs, causing it fall over, before cutting off chunks.  

Local police spokesman Tikhon Belousov said: 'There were 25,000 people in Freedom Square the night the statue came down.

'What did people expect us do do, round them all up for questioning?'

More than 160 monuments of Lenin have been toppled in the Ukraine since December 8. 

The main terminal of Donetsk airport was under siege by pro-Russian rebels today, where Ukrainian armed forces are holed up

Residential areas in Donetsk have also been caught in the crossfire, with both sides refusing to take the blame for the shelling of the Red Cross' offices

Elsewhere in Ukraine today, pro-Russian rebels faced fierce resistance from Ukrainian government forces as they tried to seize Donetsk airport.

Three rebel tanks were seen firing on the main terminal as sniper shots rang around the area.

The pro-Russians have taken some buildings on the fringes of the airport but do not have overall control. 

Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Ukraine's national security and defense council spokesman said two Ukrainian servicemen had been killed and other nine wounded in the last 24 hours. 

Fighting for the airport has intensified this week, threatening to derail the truce declared on September 5. 

Residential areas in Donetsk have also been caught in the crossfire, with a member of the Red Cross killed on Thursday when the group's officer was shelled.

The rebels said the shelling came from the Ukrainian side, while Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin blamed the blast on 'terrorists.'

A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last night that the aid worker's death, along with the shelling of a school that killed three people earlier this week, 'underscore the fragility of the current cease-fire and the importance of ensuring a secure environment in south-eastern Ukraine that will allow humanitarian actors to carry out their work and deliver critical assistance to those most in need.'
