A woman who bought a can of green beans on sale for 69 cents got way more than she paid for when she opened it to find a whole toad.

But if you ask her, she’ll specify that it was missing its leg (they were mixed in with the beans).

Gloria Chubb of St. Joseph County, Indiana didn’t notice the critter as she opened the can of Meijer beans and microwaved them for her family’s dinner of meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and gravy.

But when her son scooped some onto his plate, he noticed it had something extra.

Disgusting: Indiana woman Gloria Chubb opened a can of green beens and found a toad

‘I thought maybe it was a piece of moldy bacon or something,’ Chubb told WBND. ‘Because they have bacon in them sometimes.

‘And I took it out of there and it wasn't moldy bacon. It was a toad with parts of his little legs all in the green beans, other than that he was fully intact.’

Chubb couldn’t believe her eyes.

‘I was sick, nauseated for two days,’ said Chubb.

Chubb took her purchase back to the 
store where she’d purchased them, Meijer. They gave her a full refund 
for the can with the toad and all the other cans she’d purchased along 
with it.

She also took the can in question, and its slimy contents, to the St. Joseph County Health Department.

There, food service director Rita Hooten sent her to the Indiana State Department of Health.

Appalled: 'Nauseated for two days,' is how Gloria Chubb, right, described her reaction to a toad, left, she found in a 69 cent can of green beans

Their conclusion? The toad was, 
indeed, packed in the can along with the beans. Canned food processing, 
Chubb learned, is so fast paced the toad was likely totally overlooked.

‘When
the green beans were picked from the field, it was also placed on a 
conveyor line and just was accidentally put into the can of green beans 
during process,’ said Hooten.

That didn’t sit well with Chubb.

‘I think they should come up with a better way of inspecting and canning vegetables. I mean anything can happen you know but a whole frog?’ she said.

Last week, the company that processed the can sent Chubb an apology and $50.

Meijer grcers sent WBND a statement saying, ‘We sincerely regret this customer's experience, and we are in the process of investigating the incident.’

According to the Indiana Department of Health, rodents and insects are also commonly found in canned food, as well as in frozen products.

Steal: The Meijer brand beans got Chubb and apology and fifty bucks, but she didn't think it was worth it
