North Korea tour company, Experience North Korea, is showing for the first time at next week's World Travel Market in London.

Not only is the Shanghai-based operator facing the usual challenge of promoting trips to the unpopular Communist country, but now, it's attempting to do so when North Korea has just closed its borders due to the Ebola scare.

Nevertheless, the tour company remains optimistic ahead of their four day stint at the ExCeL exhibition centre.

The company will be faced with a particularly hard sell this year as the unpopular Communist country has just closed its borders in the wake of the world Ebola scare

Nathalie Armengol, the owner of Experience North Korea, says: 'While we have not yet been given a timescale for the reopening of the border, we have been reassured it is a temporary issue until measures are put in place.'

North Korea has never been a particularly easy sell as a tourist destination, as visitors are unable to travel there on their own and there are no mobile phone communications.

Upon arrival, government tour guides accompany visitors at all time.

Still, Armengol insists that visits are 'not only possible, but safe.'

'We want to change people's minds about North Korea,' she says.

'People are really surprised when they visit. You have to respect the rules and stay with your guides but you will see amazing beauty and untouched nature.'

However, owner of Experience North Korea, Nathalie Armengol, insists that the border will open again soon

Many who visit North Korea are also surprised by the untouched nature and countryside, Nathalie says

The four-day travel trade exhibition begins on Monday, November 3 and is one of the largest tourism events in the world.

A recent holiday confidence survey released ahead of the World Travel Market shows that there is a growing desire among job-secure Britons to plan overseas holidays within the next 12 months.

But potential holidaymakers are still keeping an eye on their wallets - the amount individuals are expected to spend on trips will likely increase only marginally.

From foreign exchange company First Rate Exchange and the Institute of Travel & Tourism, the survey showed that 10 per cent of the 5,017 adults polled planned to take more holidays over the next 12 months.

37 per cent intend to take two trips abroad compared with a figure of 35 per cent a year ago.

But 24 per cent felt their holiday plans could be affected should interest rates rise.Â
