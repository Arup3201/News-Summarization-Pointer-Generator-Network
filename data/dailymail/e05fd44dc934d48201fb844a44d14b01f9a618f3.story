For three decades, it has teased afternoon television viewers with its classic murder mystery plot

So you would imagine Agatha Christie’s drama Death on the Nile would be the last thing to fall foul of the censors.

Yesterday, however, TV watchdogs ruled that the 1978 thriller – starring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot – is too violent to be screened on daytime television in its uncut form.

Following a single complaint from a viewer to Ofcom, ITV executives have promised that in future they will edit the closing scene, which shows a character committing suicide, when showing the film before the 9pm watershed.

The move comes despite the fact that the film has already been shown before that time on more than 20 occasions since 2004 alone.

A viewer complained after the film was shown at 3.30pm on Saturday, March 17.

In the closing moments, after the murderer has been identified, the character Jackie de Bellefort – played by Mia Farrow – shoots her lover in the head off camera. 

She then puts the revolver to her head and shoots herself, causing blood to trickle from the wound.

The viewer complained to Ofcom that the scene was too violent to be transmitted when children would have been watching – breaching the rule that violence shown before the watershed must be justified by the context. Ofcom yesterday criticised ITV for screening the scene.

ITV said the criticised scenes were essential to the plot and that Agatha Christie detective stories were not of particular interest to children

It said: ‘Her suicide was shown in some detail and was not appropriately limited.

‘Given the Saturday afternoon scheduling of this film, our assessment was that it was likely that a significant number of children would have been watching ITV’s main and public service channel at this time.’

It said audience figures indicated that 71,000 viewers watching were under 16. 

‘While recognising the importance of including such a pivotal scene, we were concerned that the impact of the second gunshot was not edited or removed,’ it said.

ITV said the criticised scenes were essential to the plot and that Agatha Christie detective stories were not of particular interest to children – especially younger children.

But it said: ‘In keeping with our periodic review of pre-watershed material and in the light of viewer concerns, particularly those of parents, we undertook some additional editing of this scene for future daytime broadcasts.’
