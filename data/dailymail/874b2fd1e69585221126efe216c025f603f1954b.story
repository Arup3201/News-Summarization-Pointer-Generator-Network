Shocking video shows the moment a driver smashed into an oncoming car.

Helmet camera footage captured by the 20-year-old driver in Adelaide shows him colliding with a vehicle head on, sending him flying over the handlebars of his Kawasaki Ninja 300 and into the path of oncoming traffic.

The 20-year-old-driver was flung onto the road headfirst, suffering damage to the ligament in his knee

He can be heard swearing as he hurtles towards the red car and smashes into it

The risks associated with riding motor bike are illustrated in the Adelaide driver's helmet camera footage, which shows him riding along a road and losing control of his bike within seconds. 

He can be heard swearing as he hurtles towards an oncoming red car and smashes into it. 

The motorbike rider flips over and lands on the ground with a grunt, and the car he smashed into is seen pulling up nearby. 

The camera attached to the driver's helmet drops to face the ground and the 20-year-old, clearly in shock, breathes deeply. 

A bystander who happens to be a doctor gets out of another car and comes to the aid of the man almost immediately. 

The woman asks the man to lie on his back without moving his neck, and asks if he is injured. 

The 20-year-old says he has hurt his knee and asks to be moved off the road, away from danger of other cars. 

The description of the video says the bike, a Ninja 300, was 'written off as unrepairable' after the collision

A Ninja 300. Police have labelled the new-model Kawasaki Ninja H2, which holds the record for the world's fastest motorcycle, as a 'recipe for disaster'

'I don't think [my injury] is that bad I'm just scared to move in case it's worse than I think,' the injured driver says. 

The doctor and another man help him get up and off the road as an ambulance pulls up.

In the description of the video, which was uploaded onto YouTube by SnarkieVlogs, it says the bike, a Ninja 300, was 'written off as unrepairable.'  

The driver says he suffered damage to the ligament in his knee, but was otherwise unscathed.

A message on the screen points out a woman in the video, who was reportedly the driver of the car. The description of the video says the driver was found at fault by police

Some Facebook users have highlighted how fortunate the driver was that an ambulance was able to reach him so quickly

The video has been uploaded onto the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page on Wednesday, where it has garnered over 2000 likes and 500 shares.

Some Facebook users have highlighted how fortunate the driver was, with Brendan Duncan posting: 'A doctor there instantly and an Ambo a moment later, you should of (sic) bought a lotto ticket ASAP.'

Mal Fraser wrote : 'Wow, that response vehicle was rapid response. A lot of sensible persons involved, on the scene.'

Others have criticised the bystander who advised the driver to move off the road, arguing he should not have undermined the doctors advice.

Elaine Webber said: 'as the doctor said her car was there and there was people all around him so he was safe, AND YOU DO NOT MOVE SOME-ONE to protect their neck and spine, the doctor was right.'

The Kawasaki Ninja H2 is expected to go on sale in Australia early next year for about $30,000 and will be available to anyone who holds a full motorcycle license.
