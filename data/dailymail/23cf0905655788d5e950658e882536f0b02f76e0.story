French second division club Clermont have now given the job to another female, with 39-year-old Diacre taking up the role.

Didn't start: Helena Costa cited 'personal reasons' for why she won't coach Clermont Foot

Costa has 
remained tight-lipped about why she decided to step down as coach of 
Clermont after less than two months in charge, but stressed that it was 
her decision.

The
 Portuguese, who left her role with the Iranian women's national side to
 join Clermont, said at a press conference on Tuesday that she had gone 
through her reasons with club president Claude Michy and that she would 
not disclose them publicly.

'I had a lot of points that I discussed personally with the president and after that discussion I took my decision,' Costa said.

'The president knows exactly what it is and he's the only person that I have to discuss (it with).'

She said that it was not something she had taken lightly and she hopes she will be given more opportunities in the future.

'I thought over my holidays so of course I would appreciate if I could continue but it was my decision so I have no reasons to be sad,' she added.

'I hope in the future other opportunities will come.'
