The ancient Egyptians had prosthetic toes - and they still hold up today, according to research from the University of Manchester.

Two ancient replica toes - one found on the foot of a mummy - suggested that the Egyptians were had prosthetic body parts.

Now, for the first time in nearly 3,000 years, researchers have tried 'Walking like an Egyptian' - and confirmed the replica toes did help those missing one of their own, particularly when wearing sandals.

False toe: The replica, presumed to date from around 950BC, was found near on a mummy in Lexor

Researcher Dr Jacky Finch wanted to find 
out how successful the two discovered toes were at helping people walk.

The first toe was created from wood and leather, and dates from between 950 to 710BC, and was found on a female mummy buried near Luxor in Egypt.

The second one is the Greville 
Chester artificial toe from before 600BC, and made of cartonnage (a sort
of papier maché mixture made using linen, glue and plaster).

Both display 
significant signs of wear and their design features also suggest they 
may have been more than cosmetic additions.

Dr Finch says: 'Several experts have examined these objects and had suggested that they were the earliest prosthetic devices in existence.

'There are many instances of the ancient Egyptians creating false body parts for burial but the wear plus their design both suggest they were used by people to help them to walk.'

The toe, seen here both attached and un-attached, appears to have been designed to be worn with sandals

Dr Finch, who is based in the Faculty of Life Sciences' KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology, recruited two volunteers who were both missing their right big toe.

Design replicas of the ancient toes were made to fit each volunteer along with replica leather ancient Egyptian style sandals.

The tests were carried out at the Gait Laboratory at Salford University's Centre for Rehabilitation and Human Performance Research.

Each volunteer was asked to walk on a 10 metre walkway bare foot, in their own shoes and wearing the replicas with and without the sandals.

Their movement was tracked using 10 cameras and the pressure of their footsteps was measured using a mat.

The 10 best walking trials were recorded for each foot, using their normal left foot as the control.

Walk like an Egyptian: The big toe was put to use, with volunteers saying the replica sandals made for a comfortable walking experience

It was surprising how well both volunteers were able to walk using these devices although one volunteer performed much better than the other.

The camera footage revealed that when wearing the sandals with the cartonnage replica, one of the volunteers achieved 87 per cent of the flexion achieved by their normal left toe.

The three part wood and leather design produced nearly 78 per cent.

Interestingly the ability to push off using the prosthetic toe was not as good when this volunteer wasn't wearing the sandals.

The second volunteer was still able to produce between 60-63 per cent flexion wearing the replicas with or without the sandals.

An
ancient Egyptian kingdom close to the Nile collapsed more than 4,200 
years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change, according to new
research.

During Egypt’s Old Kingdom - the 
pyramid-building time - 4,200 years ago, droughts and fires plagued the 
region, causing famine and social unrest.

Scientists examined 7,000-year-old 
ancient pollen and charcoal samples from the Nile to piece together the 
time - and found evidence of a 'mega drought' in the the area.

Marcia McNutt, of the US Geological 
Survey (USGS), said: 'Even the mighty builders of the ancient pyramids 
more than 4,000 years ago fell victim when they were unable to respond 
to a changing climate.

'This study illustrates that water 
availability was the climate-change Achilles Heel then for Egypt, as it 
may well be now, for a planet topping seven billion thirsty people.'

When wearing the replicas the pressure measurements showed that for both volunteers there were no overly high pressure points.

This indicated that the false toes were not causing any undue discomfort or possible tissue damage.

However, when the volunteers wore just the replica sandals without the false toes the pressure being applied under the foot rose sharply.

Dr Finch says: "The pressure data tells us that it would have been very difficult for an ancient Egyptian missing a big toe to walk normally wearing traditional sandals.

'They could of course remained bare foot or perhaps have worn some sort of sock or boot over the false toe, but our research suggests that wearing these false toes made walking in a sandal more comfortable.'

Alongside the test data Dr Finch also asked her volunteers to fill in a questionnaire about how they felt when doing the trials in the gait laboratory.

Despite it having performed well the comfort scores for the cartonnage replica were disappointing although it was felt to be an excellent cosmetic replacement.

Describing the performance of the three part wooden and leather toe both volunteers found this one to be extremely comfortable, scoring it highly, one volunteer commenting that with time he could get used to walking in it.

Assessing the volunteers' experience Dr Finch said: "It was very encouraging that both volunteers were able to walk wearing the replicas.

'Now that we have the gait analysis data and volunteer feedback alongside the obvious signs of wear we can provide a more convincing argument that the original artefacts had some intended prosthetic function.'

The findings from this study, which have been published in full in the Journal of Prosthetics and Orthotics, means the earliest known prosthetic is now more likely to come from ancient Egypt.

The three part example pre-dates by some 400 years what is currently thought to be the oldest, although untested, prosthetic device.

This is a bronze and wooden leg that was found in a Roman burial in Capua, Southern Italy. That has been dated to 300 BC although only a replica now remains as the original was destroyed in a bombing raid over London during the war.
