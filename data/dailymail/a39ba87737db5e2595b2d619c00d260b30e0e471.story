A hotel hermit living in a filthy rent-controlled room was paid $17 million to leave - the highest price ever to relocate a single tenant in the city of New York, while the son of legendary General MacArthur only got $650,000 in the same deal.

Unmarried loner Herbert J. Sukenik, and Arthur MacArthur were two of the four hermits who stood in the way of the Zeckendorf brothers from knocking down the Mayflower Hotel and erecting their $1 billion 15 Central Park West - now home to A-Rod, Denzel Washington and Sting.

Refusing to vacate his decrepit, 350-square-foot room until his demands were met, Sukenik, staged a two-year masterclass in Big Apple tenant's rights that ended with him landing the huge check and a $2 million replacement apartment for which he paid $1 a month in rent until the day he died.

The revelations of Sukenik's intransigent and stubborn refusal to move in 2005 have been outlined for the first time by Michael Gross in his new book 'House of Outrageous Fortune' which chronicles the construction of 15 Central Park West.

Sukenik is painted to be academically brilliant, the nephew of the man who recognized the importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Born in The Bronx in 1930, Sukenik graduated from Cornell University with a physics degree, then went on to get a master's in physics and then a Ph.D before qualifying as a doctor.

He worked for General Electric's Research laboratory and was named chief of space medicine at Martin Company's Space Systems Division.

He moved into the Mayflower Hotel in 1974 - by which time he had become angry with the world - despite having been bequeathed a fortune by his father - who he had a difficult relationship with.'Herbert Sukenik’s profile was a nightmare,' said Will Zeckendorf, one of the two Manhattan real estate developers who built 15 Central Park West.

'Hugely intelligent, a Ph.D., unmarried, embittered, a loner, disconnected from society, and too smart for his own good. He was not a poor man; he had independent means.'

Indeed, after taking control of the Mayflower Hotel, the Zeckendorf brothers set about removing the last four men who remained in the rent-controlled apartments in the top floors - each of whom had been living up there for the best part of 40-years.

One man was 98 and left with only one suitcase and a million-dollar check. Another was an aging show-business agent, also in his 90s, who took a million dollars and then left according to the New York Post.

The third was registered as David Jordan, but the Zeckendorf brothers were shocked to discover that that his real name for Arthur MacArthur IV - the son of World War II General and 'American Caesar', Douglas MacArthur.

Born in Manila in 1938m Arthur was a minor celebrity as a child - and graced the cover of Life magazine while his father was running the Pacific war for the United States.

However, it is claimed that he wanted to escape the shadow of his father's fame, changed his name and dropped out of the public eye when his father died in 1964.

The gifted musician was paid $650,000 to leave the Mayflower and moved to Greenwich Village - where he remains to this day.

However, for Michael Grabow, the attorney charged with removing the tenants, no one was more stubborn than Sukenik.

'He knew the last man standing was very valuable,' said Grabow.

When Grabow first met Sukenik, he was struck by the mess of his tiny room, which had a kitchenette, a bathroom and views of Central Park and the East and Hudson Rivers - but the windows were so filthy they could not be seen.

It was 'a wreck, a mess,' Grabow says. 'Clothes everywhere. Papers, magazines, two computers. He had to clear chairs to sit on.'

Describing Sukenik, then aged 73, as having 'an old man smell' of someone who 'didn't shower much', Grabow conceded that the old man was clearly brilliant.

However, he was bitter. Annoyed that he had wasted his life idling away in his rent-controlled apartment.

Grabow discovered that Sukenik was disliked by the Mayflower staff, 'He was a bitcher, a complainer,' said a former Mayflower manager.

However, Sukenik knew the value of everything attached to his tiny room as compared to the value the Zeckendorf brothers expected to attach to 15 Central Park West.

He demanded a replacement apartment in Essex House on Central Park South that was 2,200 square-foot, had two bedrooms and was on the 16th floor.

The deal was that the Zeckendorf brothers would buy the apartment, retain ownership, but that he could have it for life at a rent of $1 a month.

However, just as it seemed that Sukenik was ready to leave, he told Grabow that he had got himself a lawyer and that he now wanted money - and lots of it.

The Zeckendorf's refused to budge and even began the demolition of the Mayflower hotel around the room of Sukenik.

Undeterred, Sukenik told the real estate developers that he loved the noise and the commotion.

The game of waiting paid-off and in 2005 he left to move into the apartment on Central Park South and was gifted $17 million dollars.

The first wrecking ball hit the Mayflower two days after Michael Grabow delivered Sukenik’s check.

He died aged 80 living inside his new luxurious $1 a month apartment and left his fortune to his brother.
