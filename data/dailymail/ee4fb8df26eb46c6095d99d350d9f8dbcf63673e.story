The owner of New York City's famed Carnegie Deli has revealed an even greater betrayal by the woman who stole her husband: she also stole her recipes.

Marian Levine, 63, has already filed a lawsuit against her husband Sandford Levine for giving his lover, former Carnegie Deli waitress Penkae Siricharoen, a rent-stabilized apartment in the block Levine owns above the deli on Seventh Ave.

Now she says her husband paid for his lover's Queens restaurant, made mortgage payments on the $600,000 home she bought in Queens on her waitress's wage, paid for plastic surgery to her eyes and nose and gave her access to Carnegie Deli's famous recipes for cheesecake, pastrami and corned beef.

According to the New York Post, Penkae Siricharoen's relatives opened a restaurant in Thailand which was originally called Carnegie Deli Thailand but later changed its name to New York Cheese Cake after taking a tour of Carnegie Deli's New Jersey plant where all the deli's cured meats and cheesecakes are produced.

Levine says she was unaware that her 'trade secrets' had been shared with the Thais, who have received rave reviews online for their authentic New York cheesecake and huge pastrami sandwiches.

The New York Post reports that Marian Levine is seeking a divorce from her husband after discovering the depths of his betrayal.

Marian and Sandford Levine married in 1991. She says his affair with Siricharoen has been going on for a decade, and was an open secret among the staff at Carnegie Deli.

'Everybody knew but me,' Levine told the Post.

Siricharoen, 61, is a Thai immigrant who worked for the deli for many years.

She was originally hired by Levine's father, who left the restaurant to his daughter Marian Levine when he died and was friendly with the Levines, even joining them on vacation.

According to the Post, Levine remained ignorant of her husband's affair and financial dealings until he began urging her to sell the deli last year. She hired a private investigator who uncovered the affair and other secrets.

Siricharoen left Carnegie Deli in 2008 to run her Queens restaurant in 2008, but remained on the payroll long after.

'Somebody punched her in,' Levine told the New York Post.

'She was making $750 a week as a manager even though she wasn’t there.'

The lawsuit
Levine has filed in Manhattan Supreme Court claims her 
husband of more than two decades, Sandford Levine, 71, gave Siricharoen a rent-stabilised apartment in her building on 
Seventh Avenue for $975 a month for 15 years.

The
apartment would go for $3,000 a month on the open market and the suit 
calls the deal Sandford’s ‘way of providing a gift to Siricharoen with 
whom he was having a romantic relationship’.

Levine
accuses the pair of having ‘conspired’ to cheat her out of money she 
was rightfully owed under the lease, and asks a judge to throw the 
15-year deal out.

The 
76-year-old deli, famed for its corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, has
been visited by many celebrities, including the likes of President 
Obama, Woody Allen, Taylor Swift and Henny Youngman, according to the New York Daily News.

Levine inherited the deli from her father Milton Parker and ran it with her husband for several years.

Sandford even became the face of the restaurant, carrying a business card that read, ‘MBD – Married Boss’s Daughter’.

Marian also inherited the apartment building that houses it, 854 Seventh Avenue, after her father’ s death in 2009.

The suit seeks to get Siricharoen, who is from Thailand, out of the building altogether, on the grounds that she used a ‘false identity’ to rent the apartment. 

It says she is in the U.S. illegally, and rented the apartment using documents that belonged to her deceased sister.

The status of the Levines’ relationship is unknown. The suit says the couple, who tied the knot in 1991, is still married, but also refers to Sandy Levine as a ‘former employee’. 

TV stars: Marian and Sandford, pictured, hosted a reality show from 2011 to 2012, called Family Pickle, which showcased their life running the restaurant

It accuses him of having ‘engaged in dishonest, intentional, willful, wanton and reckless misconduct while he was employed by plaintiff’.

The suit says he and Siricharoen carried on an ‘extramarital affair and romantic relationship’ from ‘approximately 1998 to the present’.

The Levines starred in their own short-lived reality show between 2011 and 2012 called Family Pickle, which showcased their efforts to run the restaurant.

In a bio on the show's website, the pair are described as 'a perfect match: equal in drive, bluster, and passion. Though their head-to-head battles are a matter of daily routine, their bond is like nuclear fusion: as unbreakable as it is fiery hot.'

According to the Post, Sandford Levine and Penkae Siricharoen are living together in a $1 million house in Boca, Florida.
