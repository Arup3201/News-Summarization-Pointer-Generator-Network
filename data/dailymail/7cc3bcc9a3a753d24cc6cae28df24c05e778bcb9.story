Susan Wurtzel owns a Today show 
T-shirt and a mug. When the stay-at-home mom and her family visited New 
York from their home in Germantown, Maryland, they joined the crowd of fans 
outside the NBC morning show's Rockefeller Center studio.

Now, after more than 20 years as a regular Today viewer, Wurtzel tunes to CBS most mornings.

Multiply such defections and you have 
the chief reason for television's changing fortunes in morning news, 
where ABC's Good Morning America has ended NBC's epic 17-year winning 
streak on Today.

ABC is growing — GMA has 110,000 more viewers each 
day this year than last — but not as much as NBC is slipping, 437,000 
viewers a day since last year.

Used to winning: The Today Show had been the morning show with the most viewers for the past 17 years before April of this year when GMA ruined their winning streak

The new dream team: ABC's Good Morning America are getting thousands more viewers than Today since Ann Curry was sacked

Wurtzel, 57, left last spring because of Today co-host Ann Curry.

'Ann's interview style was like chalk on
a board to me,' she said. 'She leaned toward her interviewee and 
whispered her questions like someone had died.

'The more serious the 
interview, the quieter she got. When she replaced Meredith Vieira, I 
tried to adjust and accept, but she just didn't work for me. Katie Couric and Meredith were relatable, empathetic and funny. Ann just 
seemed out of place.'

Executives at NBC were quietly reaching the same conclusion and moved to replace Curry with Savannah Guthrie.

Then came June 28, 2012, Curry's last 
day as co-host. She cried in bewilderment at her perceived failure at 
losing the job she had sought for years, as her uncomfortable co-workers
and a nation looked on.

Suddenly, a problem for NBC became a BIG
problem. Even people who didn't particularly like Curry loathed the way
she was dispatched.

Except for two weeks during the Olympics, Today 
hasn't sniffed first place in the ratings since.

Struggling: Curry cried in bewilderment at her perceived failure at losing the job she had sought for years, as her uncomfortable co-workers and a nation looked on

During the first six 
months of 2012, Today averaged just under 5.2 million viewers each 
weekday.

Since July 2, the audience has dropped to 4.59 million, 
according to Nielsen, the company that measures TV audiences.

Without 
the two weeks of the London Olympics, the average is 4.3 million. That's
a stunning drop, even accounting for typical lower viewership in the 
summer.

An informal survey of three dozen 
viewers who have left or are considering leaving Today turned up 
various explanations, including a feeling that the show had leaned too 
far in the direction of lighter, pop culture fare.

The Curry dismissal 
was clearly a tipping point, however.

William Runge, a manager at an 
educational cable network who lives in suburban Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 
likened the treatment of Curry to 'a public flogging'.

'The PR machine at NBC spent an enormous
amount of time and effort convincing me that the Today show team was 
actually part of my family, "America's First Family", said Runge, 46, 
citing the show's advertising slogan.

In charge: Today executive producer Jim Bell, 
center, is pictured with Meredith Vieira, Ann Curry, Matt Lauer, and 
Bryant Gumbel earlier this year

Admitting fault: Matt Lauer spoke on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight saying that he didn't want to leave because he believes there is still work to be done to make the show stronger

'Guess what? They were right. 
These did feel like family members. So this is how you are going to 
treat a member of your family?

'You can debate for hours whether Ms 
Curry was right for the role,' he said. 'That's not the point. She was 
doing her job and was barely 11 months into it when they canned her in 
the most humiliating way possible.'

The move was 'heart-wrenching', said 
Isabelle Langelier, a 40-year-old manager at a drug company from 
Montreal. 'It made me feel sick for her. And it made me turn the 
channel, probably permanently.'

'While I thought Ann Curry's interviews 
were a little hokey at times, she is clearly the most genuine person in 
TV news,' said Sarah Rosenthal, 53, a graduate student and mother of 
three from West Chester, Pennsylvania.

'After her unceremonious dumping, I turned 
it off. I have nothing against Savannah, and adore Natalie Morales, but 
there is just a different tone to the show.'

Even worse for NBC, a significant number
of viewers appear to blame co-host Matt Lauer for the move.

The network
has consistently denied tabloid reports that Lauer was unhappy with 
Curry. Today Executive Producer Jim Bell said late last month that 
Lauer was being treated unfairly. Firing Curry was Bell's decision, he 
said.

Some awkward public moments haven't 
helped.

Worrying: ABC is growing — GMA has 110,000 more viewers each 
day this year than last — but not as much as NBC is slipping, 437,000 
viewers a day since last year

The moment Lauer lost his likability? Curry's 
unceremonious booting off the show has long been a thorn in Lauer's 
side, after it was claimed he was responsible for getting her axed

When Curry reappeared on Today during the London Olympics to 
introduce a story she had done, Lauer twice remarked that it was good to
see her again. Curry didn't return the sentiment to the man she worked 
with for 15 years.

Two years ago, Lauer's positive 'Q' 
score was 23 — meaning 23 per cent of people who knew him considered 
Lauer one of their favorite broadcasters, according to Marketing 
Evaluations Inc, a company that measures public sentiment toward 
well-known personalities.

Meet the new host: It has been reported that Willie Geist will join the Today show to to serve as co-host during the 9am hour

Now his positive score is 14. At the same 
time, Good Morning America co-host Robin Roberts' positive 'Q' score 
jumped from 20 to 27.

Langelier felt there was a perception 
that Lauer was 'king' and others on the show aren't equal to him.

Lyle 
Nelson, 40, a salesman from Avondale, Arizona, said Lauer was 'not someone
I'd like to have a beer with'.

'There is something about Matt Lauer, 
whether or not he was the reason for Curry's firing, that has changed 
and I do not like watching the show anymore,' said John Friia, a 
20-year-old aspiring journalist from Malverne, New York.

Fortunately for NBC, viewers don't seem to be taking out their unhappiness on Guthrie.

Producers often say that viewing 
decisions for morning television can be intensely personal, since people
are essentially inviting these personalities into their homes at an 
intimate time of day when they were getting ready for work.

Feeling a 
part of the TV 'family' they see on air is part of it, and sometimes the
reasoning seems strange. Nelson said, for example, that he didn't like 
the couch on Today because it looked uncomfortable.

'In today's doom and gloom news 
programs, the Today show gave me a lift to get my day started,' said 
Taren Robin, 48, from Paris, Kentucky. 'I don't get that lift anymore, and I 
am in mourning over the fact. I haven't found anything I like better to 
take its place.'

At least one-third of people who responded to a Twitter request to discuss the show cited its content for their discontent.

'I used to be a regular Today show 
viewer but got tired of their formula,' said Dan Laufer, 35, a sports 
marketer from Washington, D.C.

'Five minutes of hard news followed by an
animal rescue story, the Kardashians and then pop culture or fashion. 
It's OK with me — in moderation.'

Joan Pierce is a 64-year-old retired 
nurse from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, who watched Today for 40 years. Now 
she says: 'I don't care what Lindsay Lohan does.'

'I was fed up with the lack of actual 
news reporting, and more intense focus on silly, irrelevant things like 
women's fashion or the newest celebrity's recipe for a dinner I could 
never find the time or money to cook,' said Zach Beale, a 23-year-old 
college student in Savannah, Georgia.

Biting as they may be, at least those 
complaints offer Today the seeds of potential recovery.

Good Morning 
America, particularly in its second hour, has an even greater pop 
culture emphasis. Bell said his show will try to draw a greater contrast
with its ABC rival in coming months.

A recent ad with Lauer touts the 
'informative' nature of the show. Curry, who has kept her job with NBC 
as a hard news reporter, appeared on Today during the past month 
interviewing Libyan President Mohammed Magarief and reporting from 
Syria.

CBS has already tried to position itself
as a newsier alternative in the morning. Because Today has a richer 
history and often twice as many viewers, it would be in better position 
to reach people who want this.

NBC announced this week that Willie 
Geist, an engaging and popular member of MSNBC's Morning Joe team, 
will join Today as a co-host of the 9am hour and occasionally 
appear earlier.

'What I loved about the show were the 
hosts, reporters and the stories,' said Miriam Sajecki, a marketer from 
Staten Island, New York, who has watched Today for more than 20 years.

'It 
was always delivered in a friendly, engaging and informative manner. 
Some of that has changed in that I miss the chemistry that was displayed
with the prior hosts ... and some of the stories Today was known for.

'It has evolved into forgettable reports without giving me the important
news and educational stories.'

Still, Sajecki is a loyalist. 'I will continue to watch the Today show and wake up to it every weekday,' she said.

NBC needs devoted fans like Sajecki to turn things around. It will take some time.
