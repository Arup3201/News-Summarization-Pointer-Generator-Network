Saido Berahino has thanked England for giving him ‘a second chance’ after he fled war-torn Burundi as an infant and admitted he once thought his life was over.

The West Bromwich Albion striker has shared his story on World Refugee Day to raise awareness of the plight of millions around the world.

Berahino, 20, spoke of losing his father in Burundi’s civil war and separating from his mother Liliane for two years as she sought a new home for her family in Birmingham.

Thank you: Saido Berahino, pictured scoring for England U21s, has achieved his dream despite being a refugee and losing his father when he was just 10

Once Berahino arrived in Britain aged 10 seeking political asylum he endured an agonising wait of two months as doctors gave him and his mum DNA testing to confirm they were related. He described his ‘amazing joy’ at finally being reunited with her.

He had stayed with a caring family in that time but struggled to communicate as he could not speak a word of English.

‘The things I have gone through I wouldn’t wish anyone to go through,’ Berahino says in a video released exclusively to MailOnline. ‘I thank England for giving me a second chance and making it easy to follow the dream I have always had to become a footballer.’

Personal story: Berahino spoke our about his childhood as a refugee in a video to mark World Refugee Day on June 20

Berahino was approached by the United Nations and asked to tell his side of the story – for the first time on video and in such depth – to coincide with World Refugee Day on June 20.

Burundi was torn apart by ethnic conflict between 1993 and 2005, and forced more than 1.5 million people, including Berahino, to flee their homes and leave everything behind.

‘It was a tough time for me,’ he says. ‘I didn’t really understand what was happening around the country because I was still a young boy.

‘In the late 1990s we had to leave the country, I separated from my mother and stayed with one of her friends. We flew to Tanzania, from there we had to catch buses, we had to walk. I was kept apart for two years before meeting my mother in England.’

Berahino adds: ‘Any refugees out there, never give up. Just because you’ve gone through a rough patch doesn’t mean your life is over. I once thought mine was but I’ve come through with hard work.’
