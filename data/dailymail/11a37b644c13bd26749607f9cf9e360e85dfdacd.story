Here's one trucker who knows a thing or two about lane discipline.

As the semi was being buffeted by high winds along a highway in Kansas, the trucker managed to remain upright - but only just!

The big rig leaned more than 45 degrees over to the right, on the road near Hays.

The man was driving for KCK-based Butler Transport.

Scroll down for video...

About to flip! An 18-wheeler nearly flips over, amid what were believed to be 60-mile-per-hour winds on a Kansas highway and the driver behind the semi caught it all on video

Going, going: Even those who caught the near accident on video can't quite believe what they're seeing

Opinion: Other truckers say the driver's recovery was 70-percent luck and 30-percent skill

Truckers who have watched the video say the man's skill, the western Kansas sand grabbing the rig's tires and perhaps pure luck helped save the day.

The drama was captured by a driver who was traveling right behind the rig.

Jeff Steinberg, owner and instructor at APEX CDL Institute, told Fox Carolina the driver of the semi did an outstanding job in keeping the rig from rolling over.

'That driver deserves a medal,' Steinberg said. 'That was a great driving maneuver there.'

Saving the day: The driver rescues the rig by turning into the tilt and

'He did the only thing you could do, which was a perfect reaction to turn in the wind,' Steinberg said. 'There's no way to actually teach that.'

Semis can easily tip over in the wind, especially when they're empty.

Truck rollovers are the number one cause of fatalities for commercial drivers and it's usually caused after drivers are thrown out of the vehicles.

Off-road: The truck turns off the highway and into a field after managing to stop the rig from toppling

Driving skills: Amazingly thanks to luck and skill the driver manages to right the semi

Safe at last: The truck pulls off into a nearby field, the driver presumably, counting his blessings
