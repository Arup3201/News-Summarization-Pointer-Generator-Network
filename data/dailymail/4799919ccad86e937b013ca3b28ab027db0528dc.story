A former US defense contractor has pleaded guilty to sending sensitive information about US military jet programs to his native Iran in an effort to land a job.

On Wednesday, 60-year-old Mozaffar Khazaee pleaded guilty in federal court to violating the Arms Export Control Act and faces up to 20 years in prison.

Federal prosecutors say that Khazaee stole information about engines used in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and F-22 Raptor programs from three employers during his time as an engineer for U.S. defense contractors.

One of the employers was Connecticut-based Pratt & Whitney.

Khazaee allegedly tried to use that information to land a job with multiple universities in Iran from 2009 to 2013. 

In one email to a person in Iran, court records show that Khazaee wrote that he was taking a 'big risk' by sending the information.

'Again please after downloading these two Power Point files delete everything immediately,' Khazaee wrote. 

A search of Khazaee's computer revealed the documents he stole as well as applications to Iranian universities, FOX reports. 

Authorities found a cover letter on the man's computer which advertised skills the man learned while working on projects in the U.S.

He wrote: 'I have learned some of the key technique[s] that could be transferred to our own industry and universities.'

Khazaee also wrote that he was 'looking for an opportunity to work in Iran, and ...transferring my skill and knowledge to my nation.'   

Hubert Santos, Khazaee's lawyer, held that Khazaee was wrongly accused because he's an Iranian citizen. He said Khazaee was simply trying to impress a potential employer.

In November 2013, a shipment prepared by Khazaee containing materials related to military jet engines was seized by customs agents in Long Beach, California. 

The shipment was headed to Iran. 

Khazaee was arrested at a New Jersey airport just months later in January 2014 while attempting to board a flight to Iran. 

Authorities reportedly found sensitive U.S. information in the man's luggage. 

Khazaee will be sentenced in May and, along with his potential sentence, faces a $1 million fine.

Shortly after Khazaee's arrest, Pratt & Whitney officials issued a statement saying they are 'fully cooperating' with the government on the matter. 

U.S. Attorney Deirde Daly said in a statement that the U.S. will 'aggressively' investigate and hold accountable those who attempt to steal U.S. trade secrets and the illegal export of such information compromises 'national security.'
