A relaxed and smiling Anne Darwin appears not to have a care in the world as she finishes a shift as a charity shop worker.

The ex-wife of canoe conman John Darwin - who fled to Panama with her husband after he faked his own death in 2002, in a bid to claim almost £1million in life insurance and pension payouts - even took the time to exchange a few pleasantries with a passer by as she shut up shop for the evening.

Having served half of a six year sentence for her role in the fraud, Anne, 61, looks to be relishing the chance to start her life a fresh.

She is now said to be enjoying living in a one-bedroom apartment, a short bus ride from the RSPCA shop where she works five days a week.

Meanwhile John, 62, is planning a fresh 
start - possibly back in Panama. He also served three years of a 
six-year jail term and was freed on licence in January 2011.

A source close to Anne told the Mirror: 'She couldn't care if he sails off to Panama and never comes back.'

Anne's neighbours know nothing of her background.

According to the Mirror, one said: 'She leaves every day at the crack of dawn and walks a quarter of
a mile to catch the bus. She's lived here seven or eight months and 
seems like a lovely lady.

'But she's very quiet. She talks to the people in the warden's office but doesn't really mix with anyone.'

However, it's a different story for back-from-the-dead John who has told friends he plans to return to the central American country.

Under his parole conditions the conman is banned from travelling abroad, but says he will leave Britain when the authorities return his passport to him in March.

Last year, a court ordered her to hand back hundreds of thousands of pounds claimed from insurance policies and pension schemes after reporting her husband's alleged death.

The couple, from Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, were jailed at Teesside Crown Court in 2008 for the swindle, which deceived the police, a coroner, financial institutions and even their sons Mark and Anthony.

A confiscation hearing in 2009 was told that the Darwins benefited to the sum of £679,194.62 from the fraud, but at that time their realisable assets amounted to just under £592,000.
