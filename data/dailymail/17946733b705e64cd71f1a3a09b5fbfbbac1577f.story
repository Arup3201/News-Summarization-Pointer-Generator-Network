Health checks will go underway for the Western Australia's freshwater crocodile population in Kimberley ahead of the inevitable arrival of poisonous cane toads to the area.

The project is run by the Department of Parks and Wildlife and plans to get a snapshot by capturing more than 100 crocodiles and examining their health at Wingjana Gorge.

District nature conservation coordinator Tracy Sonneman told Daily Mail Australia that the main aim is to study the toxic cane toads and what effect it has on the crocodile population.

'By marking it now, we will be able to see the crocodiles growth pattern over the next few years and also take caution of the cane toad population,' Ms Sonneman said.

'The research will help us get a grasp of the crocodiles population and we can also gather how many males, females, juveniles and exactly where they're sitting within the parks.

'As part of their diet, crocodiles consume cane toads but it's the poisonous glance from the toads that will usually kill the crocodiles.

'We've got the Bunuba Rangers involved, consultants, volunteers and universities, so we're really amped to be out here doing such an important work.

'The Kimberley Science Conservation Strategy funded the Bunuba Rangers to come out to help us and without them, this research wouldn't have happened.

'It's the first time it's been done in Western Australia.'

After they are captured, researchers will fill out a full page of data on each one, with two people holding it down while a third uses a tape measure to gauge length, width and head size.

As they are bundled up, their snout, arms and legs will be taped shut and lined up to wait on the shores of the lake for their turn to be examined.

Ms Sonneman said the study is a very safe process and assured that the crocodiles will have less stress levels during the procedure.

Chief researcher Ruchira Somaweera told ABC that the Windjana Gorge animals would be used as a test group, to ideally get a few years of cane-toad free data.

'Then we compare the changes in population structure and numbers, to after the cane toads have arrived,' he said.

'We are planning on doing this survey a couple of years before the cane toads arrive, and do recaptures afterwards, so we have a much better idea of which fraction of the population is being impacted.'

ABC reports that the Monash University researchers will also extract a blood sample via a needle inserted into the back of the crocodile's head to gather genetic data for a seperate research project.

After the survey is completed, the animals will be returned to their gorge waterway, 300km east of Broome.
