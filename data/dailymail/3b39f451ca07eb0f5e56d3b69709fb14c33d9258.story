Paul Collingwood will stay at Durham until the end of the 2015 season after he signed a new one-year deal with the team he skippered to the 2013 County Championship.

The 38-year-old was widely expected to announce his retirement at the end of the current campaign, but he has decided to put his plans of calling it day on ice for another year.

Durham captain Collingwood, a former England all-rounder who skippered his country to the 2010 Twenty20 World Cup, will lead the county for another season in the four-day format of the game.

Having already scored 518 runs in the championship this season in a team fighting relegation, and having averaged 68 in the Royal London One-Day Cup, Collingwood has decided to continue playing.

He had coached Scotland to the Twenty20 World Cup and also worked under Ashley Giles for the England one-day side. 

'I had presumed this was going to be my last season but I'm really enjoying my cricket and feel as though I'm still contributing to the team,' Collingwood said.

'You're a long time retired and I've still got ambitions to take this team forward.

'It really is a special group of guys to be involved with and I don't want to give that up too early.

'We've got a lot to play for in the back end of the season with the quarter-finals and trying to avoid relegation, which would be a huge achievement.

'There is a bigger picture as well which is about having another year to continue to create a culture that will hopefully be around for another five to 10 years. I'm certain that the backbone of this side, with the youngsters coming through, will be strong for years to come.'

Collingwood scored 4,259 Test runs for England in 68 matches, as well as representing his nation 197 times in ODIs and on 35 occasions in the Twenty20 format of the game.

Durham head coach Jon Lewis added: 'Everyone at the club is delighted that Paul will be continuing his career.

'His contribution as a player, leader and character in the dressing room is difficult to measure.

'It is a big lift for everyone knowing that he will be with us next year.'
