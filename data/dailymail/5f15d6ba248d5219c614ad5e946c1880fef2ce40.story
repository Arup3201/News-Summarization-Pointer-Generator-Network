Walkers could soon face being deprived 
of some of the country's most beautiful views after the prolonged cold 
and wet winter has led to a series of devastating landslides on the South Coast.

Authorities have been forced to close parts of the popular coastal path along the Jurassic Coast World Heritage site in Dorset due to a year of heavy rainfall.

Last July holidaymaker Charlotte 
Blackman, 22, was killed when a landslide caused 400 tons of rocks to 
fall on her from above as she walked along a beach at Burton Bradstock, West Dorset.

Collapse: Unprecedented weather is taking its toll on Britain's crumbling coast such as this collapse near Lulworth Cove in Dorset

And
a recent landslide at popular tourist spot Durdle Door means sections 
of the nearby coastal path overlooking the famous sight have been closed
due to safety concerns.

On that occasion around 400 tons of chalk rock covered the beach below after collapsing from the 90-million-years-old cliff.

On Sunday fresh cliff-falls and cracks at Lulworth Cove came at about 2pm and coastguards issued a warning saying the pathway is falling away.

Lulworth station officer Kevin Burt, who was called out to the landslides at the weekend told the Dorset Echo: 'There is a lot of erosion. Part of the pathway is starting to fall away.'

He said: 'It's the rain and frost 'We have had some horrendous weather.'

A spokesman for the National Trust 
said: 'Throughout the winter, water and ice has been permeating through 
the chalk so we've seen consistent but small falls of rock.

Changing face: Walkers could soon face being deprived of some of the country's most beautiful views after the prolonged cold and wet winter has led to a series of devastating landslides

Closure: Since last April heavy rain has caused several landslides on large sections of the Jurassic Coast in Dorset

Spectacular views: Walkers on the South West Cliff path. With stunning views from a great height the walk is a popular option for walkers

'The south coast is an evolving landscape and is prone to cliff erosion but the wet weather has exacerbated the falling of the chalk.

'The bad weather affects it, particularly this year.'

While cliff erosion is typically caused 
by the sudden change between cold and warm weather, ice in the rock can 
also prove harmful.

When the water deposited by rain or snow freezes it expands, causing cracks and weaknesses to form in the chalk.

Experts believe the cliffs on the southern coast will move up to 200 yards away from France this century but a series of freezing winters could accelerate the process.

Jo Rawlings from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said: 'The recent wet weather has seen sections of our coast become very vulnerable to movement. We're now warning the public that some coastal paths in particular are likely to be unstable.

'We advise people to take care when walking on top of cliffs and also give a wide berth to the base of cliffs when walking below on the shoreline.'

Crack: Earlier this year a 150ft (45m) long, 6ft (1.8m) deep crack appeared on cliffs near Bowleaze Cove, Weymouth

Safety: Walkers have been warned about a large crack which has appeared near a stretch of the Dorset coast path
