Fit for trial: Anissa Weier, 13, now understands her charges and can face court, a judge ruled Thursday

A psychiatrist has determined the second of two girls charged with stabbing a classmate 19 times in an attempt to please a fictional character called Slender Man is now mentally fit to stand trial, a judge ruled Thursday.

However the attorney for Anissa Weier, 13, has disputed the finding, claiming to have a report from another doctor declaring the Wisconsin girl incompetent.

Both reports are sealed.

Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren said the girl is competent to stand trial. 

The decision means Weier's case will now move to a preliminary hearing, where prosecutors would have to establish that she committed  attempted first-degree intentional homicide.

The judge is yet to rule on the second suspect, Morgan Geyser, who was committed for treatment in August after displaying disturbing behavior during interviews, including squatting on her chair, laughing hysterically for no reason and constantly looking in corners. 

Prosecutors have charged both girls with attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the attack in May in Waukesha, a city of 71,000 about 15 miles west of Milwaukee. 

They say the girls plotted for months to kill classmate Payton Leutner, luring her to a wooded park after a sleepover and stabbing her 19 times. 

After her attackers left, Leutner crawled through the woods to a sidewalk where a bicyclist found her and called 911.

The two girls charged in the case were found walking toward a national forest where they said they believed Slender Man lived in a mansion.

Recovering: Leutner was stabbed so severely she could not speak following the attack

In court: Weier is pictured in court in June, but doctors have deemed she is yet not competent to stand trial

They told investigators they believed killing Leutner would curry favor with the figure.

Slender Man is in the internet generation's version of the Boogeyman.

He first appeared as a blurry figure in the background of some photos posted online around 2009, with nonsense stories soon circulating that his presence meant something bad was going to happen.

Like the Boogeyman, Slender Man is meant to kill children. 

Wisconsin law requires anyone accused of certain serious crimes to be charged as adults if they are 10 or older. 

All three girls were 12 at the time of the incident. 

Weir has since turned 13. 

The victim survived returned to school in September to start seventh grade.

Consequences: If convicted, Weier (left) and Geyser (right) could face up to 65 years in prison. But if tried in juvenile court, they would not be held past age 25

A court-appointed psychologist testified in August that Geyser, who told police she stabbed the victim more than a dozen times, heard voices and believed she could communicate with Slender Man and other fictional characters.

A psychiatrist hired by the defense, Kenneth Robbins, testified that girl was more concerned about her relationship with Slender Man than she was about going to prison.

She said she communicated telepathically with Slender Man and feared he would harm her or her family if she said too much about him, Robbins said.

He said she also speaks and sees Voldemort and another Harry Potter character, Snape.

'For her, these are real characters,' Robbins said.

'She sees them and they have discussions back and forth.'

If convicted as adults, each could be locked up for up to 65 years. In the juvenile system, they could not be held past age 25.
