Supermodel Linda Evangelista and the billionaire father of her five-year-old son have settled their bitter child support battle - over the phone.

The surprise settlement, revealed by a source to The New York Post, comes three days into the court scrap that revealed some of the uglier truths about the former couple's four-month relationship.

In the first two days on the witness stand, Francois-Henri Pinault, who is now married to actress Salma Hayek, revealed he broke up with Evangelista when he discovered she was pregnant.

Settled: Supermodel Linda Evangelista, pictured arriving at court on Monday, has made a surprise child support settlement with Francois-Henri Pinault, the father of her son

And Evangelista's lawyer also claimed the
Frenchman, who is heir to a staggering $11.5 billion family estate, had
demanded the supermodel have an abortion as he did not want the child.

It
is not clear whether Evangelista has won the $46,000 a month she 
expected Pinault to pay for their son, with the source only claiming he 
had 'gone a  long way toward meeting those original demands'.

The
exact settlement was not disclosed by the source, but it comes just 
before Evangelista was due to take the witness stand, potentially 
offering further insight into Pinault's reluctance to raise a child.

The
legal teams will appear in the Manhattan family court at 2pm today 
to announce the settlement. It is believed they will have to return to 
court on Tuesday to confirm the details in writing.

Shake-up: The agreement comes as Evangelista was due to testify against Pinault on Monday

The court battle, which began last Thursday, has focused on the care of five-year-old Augie, who was conceived during his parents short-lived relationship in 2005 and 2006.

His supermodel mother had said the boy's care - including around-the-clock nannies and armed drivers - cost her $46,000 a month, and she wanted Pinault to cover the hefty bills.

Evangelista's
lawyer William Beslow had also argued that Augie deserves a lifestyle 
similar to that of Pinault's four-year-old daughter with Hayek, born just months after Augie.

Pinault, 49, is heir to a family estate estimated at $11.5billion. As chief executive of 
PPR, 
the conglomerate that owns Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Bottega Veneta, he earns $5million a year.

He
spends $50,000 a month just on the taxes, upkeep and loan payments for 
the $12million Los Angeles home he's put in trust for the girl, 
Valentina, the Post reported.

And taking the witness stand, he 
revealed he spent a staggering $260,000 on gifts for himself in 2010 - 
but could not remember what he had bought his son or how much he had 
spent on him.

Escape: It is not known if Pinault, seen Monday, will pay the $46,000 a month Evangelista demanded

Bitter feud: The former couple were expected to spend four days in court to thrash out a settlement

'I have a watch collection,' he said, the New York Post reported. 'It's for when I buy a watch for me.'

He
went on: 'I bought him a present for his birthday and for Christmas,' 
yet admitted he could not remember what he bought Augie for his fourth birthday.

And for Christmas: 'I bought it online. It was a piano thing.'

Despite his wealth, Pinault had criticised Evangelista for 
her outlandish demands, suggesting the $46,000 a month is in fact for 'mom 
support'.

She has maintained she is modelling or working on her image at 
all hours of the day.

'Most of the expenses do not relate 
to Augie but they relate to Ms. Evangelista,' Pinault's lawyer, David 
Aronson, said in opening statements on Thursday.

'It is the classic case of someone trying to bootstrap herself to something that is alimony.'

Support: Ahead of the settlement on Monday, Evangelista was pictured with her son Augie and ex-boyfriend Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton, from whom she broke up last year

Also at the trial on Thursday, Evangelista's lawyer recounted a conversation the former couple shared in January 2006.

'After some initial happiness, he told her he wished she would terminate the pregnancy,' Beslow told a support magistrate.

Evangelista,
who was then in her early 40s, told Pinault she would keep the baby. 
Pinault revealed the couple had spent just seven days together in four 
months when she made the announcement.

the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Ball the same night as she was thought
to have settled her alimony suit against her former boyfriend 
Francois-Henri Pinault

'She would support the child herself, since he had made it perfectly clear to her that he had no interest in doing so. And she did.'

Pinault said he found out she was pregnant 
in early 2006 and admitted he broke up with her on hearing the news.

'She was so happy to be pregnant,' he said. 'But it was not planned. I decided to stop the relationship at that point.' He added: 'We were dating four months and I didn't even know her very much.'

Asked
why he didn’t pay Evangelista anything in child support for the first 
years of Augie's life, Pinault answered: 'She didn’t ask and I didn’t 
offer.'

Unhappy ending: Evangelista was excited about her pregnancy, while Pinault was not, he said in court

Fears: At the child support trial, Francois-Henri Pinault (left) also revealed his wife actress
Salma Hayek (pictured) feared their daughter Valentina (right) might 
have Down's syndrome

It also emerged on Friday that he had
asked his former girlfriend to delay the process of legally recognising
Augie as his son as his wife Hayek was going through a difficult 
pregnancy.

'We were told the baby had Down 
syndrome until late May 2007,' Pinault said, adding that Hayek, then 41,
almost lost their daughter Valentina.

Evangelista agreed to delay the process and he was grateful, the New York Post reported.

Although she was accused of piggybacking on Pinault's lifestyle, Evanglista's lawyer said she was 'looking for a continuation of the 
reasonable lifestyle of Augie'.

'I need to protect him,' Evangelista told Love magazine in February.

Last year a judge questioned the model's need for full-time nannies, asking how often she worked.

'When I work, it can be a 16-hour 
day,' she said. 'On days when I do not work, I am 
working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I
have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an 
athlete.'

Demands: Evangelista is not so hard up herself, earning millions from high-profile modelling campaigns, cosmetic contracts and cover shoots

Last week, Manhattan divorce lawyer Raoul Felder
said the eye-watering payout - which comes to $1,500 a day - was unlikely.

He pointed out that judges 
consider how much it costs to care for a child, rather than the wealth 
of the parents.

'She’s in for a big surprise. I wouldn’t be counting the money yet,' he told the New York Daily News.

Evangeista is worth $8million and owns a 
penthouse in Chelsea, New York and an apartment near her 
son’s school on the Upper East Side.

She
broke up with billionaire and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton 
last year and filed her case against Pinault shortly after the break up.

Since, Pinault has been paying child support - although the amount has not been disclosed.

The couple dated from 
September 2005 until January 2006, and she was pregnant with Augie when 
Pinault began dating Hayek in April 2006. He and Hayek married in 2009.

Evangelista had kept the name of Augie's father secret until it was written in court papers filed in August.
