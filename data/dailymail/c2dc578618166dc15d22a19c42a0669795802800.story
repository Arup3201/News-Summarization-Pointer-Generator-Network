She grabbed global headlines worldwide for reporting in her bikini at the G20 and now, she's about to stir another viral storm after her latest video release wrapping up the summit.

As world leaders sweltered in their suits during the G20, Susanne Ward, 27, turned up the heat when she interviewed protesters during People's March at Musgrave Park in South Brisbane.

The  video, titled 'G20 Hot Exposure', the 27-year-old is seen speaking to a shocked female protester after  the Gold Coast model approached her for online news channel 'Aussie Beach TV'.

'That's incredibly misogynistic and sexist and it's an absolute reflection of the G20's patriotic b******t that is destroying the planet,' the woman told Aussie Beach TV.

'And to put this beautiful and intelligent woman in a bikini for ratings is f*** up!' before she stormed off the camera. 

The video was posted onto YouTube on Tuesday, along with the caption: 'WARNING; Course language. Janaya and the Aussie Beach TV crew travelled to Brisbane recently to attend the G20 People's March and Summit at Musgrave Park, West End.

'We asked the citizens why they were at the march and a few more important questions.'

Ms Ward's unique reporting style on the streets of Brisbane during the G20 made international headlines 

Ms Ward, who goes by the stage name Janaya, told Daily Mail Australia that she had no qualms about flaunting her body to bring attention to politics.

‘I’m a bikini model so I didn’t feel uncomfortable about doing the interview in my bikini.

‘Anyway, I’m happy with what I’ve got going on,’ she says with a laugh.

‘With the forty degree heat, being in a bikini was the best way to do it!’

But Ms Ward, who goes by the stage name Janaya, is serious about telling people’s stories and giving them a voice about important social issues.

‘A lot of people have a lot to say but none of the normal people get heard,’ she said.

‘But they should be heard because the world is our world.’

Aussie Beach TV spoke to people on the streets in the hope they could give everyday Australians a platform so their opinions would be heard

During the G20, Ms Ward spoke to different protesters about issues including globalisation, indigenous rights and the legalisation of marijuana

During the G20, Ms Ward spoke to different protesters about issues including globalisation, indigenous rights and the legalisation of marijuana.

However she insists her preparation for the weekened only involved ‘buying another bikini’.

She says she learnt so much from interviewing everyday people in the street.

‘I never knew about things like how the government is only saying what they want us to know,’ Ms Ward told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Everyone was really smart, people blew me out of the water.'

Aussie Beach TV hires attractive women to report in their bikinis, in the hope that their stunning appearance will make ‘everyday Australians’ pay attention to the issues that matter.

‘Aussie Beach TV is based on getting the girls in bikinis to do interviews with people because it will actually get people interested and watching,’ Ms Ward said. 

The mastermind behind the idea, Markus Forest, says ‘only five to ten per cent of viewers out there said that Janaya should put some clothes on’

The mastermind behind the idea, Markus Forest, says ‘only five to ten per cent of viewers out there said that Janaya should put some clothes on’. 

During the G20, the Aussie Beach TV news crew encountered an irate woman who was offended by Ms Ward’s lack of clothing.

‘One person didn’t like what we were doing, she yelled and swore at the camera,’ said Mr Forest.

‘She asking why we were exploiting a beautiful and intelligent young woman by getting her to degrade herself.’

Mr Forest says that the angered woman's passion is exactly what the news site is all about.

‘We stick up for her right to say that; her free speech and freedom of expression,' he said.

‘So we’re going to put her fight to air because it’s a ripper!’

Janaya is serious about telling people’s stories and giving them a voice about important social issues

He started the website in late 2011 and they have already made 120 videos.

The website also includes ‘bikini entertainment’ including bikini sports, fashion and pool parties.

Mr Forest also plays a character in the series named ‘Jack Russel’, an eccentric bogan with a fake mullet and an ocker accent.

Mr Forest hopes that his unique approach will appeal to ‘the average Aussie’.

He believes his bikini reporters will captivate the audience in a unique way, so everyday Australians will learn about alternative views that do not normally receive media coverage.

‘We want to show all the news that you should have noticed but you were probably distracted, or the stories or opinions that you don’t hear on the news.’

‘We want to make it fun and more popular to talk about the important stuff.’

‘Big TV news crews came up to us and said “you have the best job”’

 

Ms Ward was relieved she was in a bikini because it was the only way to survive the heat. Mr Forest, who was in character as Jack Ruseel, was also affected by the 40 degree temperatures and stripped down to his speedos
