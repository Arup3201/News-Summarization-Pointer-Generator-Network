Kelly Brook is a curvy cracker in a set of images for her new underwear range for New Look.

The Celerity Juice presenter, 33, posed on location for her latest collaboration with the High Street fashion brand.

And the brunette's Christmas Collection is likely to go straight to the top of her fans' festive wish-lists.

Kelly Brook's latest lingerie collaboration for New Look features lace and jewel-toned satin pieces

Posing in the boudoir-inspired lace collection, Kelly is simply smouldering

The collection oozes Christmas glamour with silky satins, romantic 
lace and sheer panelling.

Rich
 in colour, the colour palette is intended to capture winter with 
midnight blues, berry red and deep jewel tones as well as plenty of 
monochrome.

In one shot the model, who is currently single, peeks over her shoulder as cascading curls fall down her back.

In another she models a pair of sheer knickers with peek-a-boo detailing.

The Collection features many of Kelly's favourite staples: Polka dots and vintage-inspired designs

And in another picture, 
Miss Brook shows off a sheer black lace print body flocked with 
polka-dot hearts and a white laced neckline, with a sexy satin gown 
draped over her shoulders.

Another
 body from the collection features midriff panelling and a polka-dot 
trim, shown off by the petite star as she reclines on a distressed 
burgundy sofa.

Retailing from £6.99, the range will be 
available from the beginning of December in selected New Look stores and
