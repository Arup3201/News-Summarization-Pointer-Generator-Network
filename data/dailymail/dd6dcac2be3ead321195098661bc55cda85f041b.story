Britons are falling out of love with plastic surgery.

The number of men and women going under the knife fell by almost 10 per cent last year – the biggest drop on record.

Much of the slump can be explained by women turning their backs on boob jobs.

The annual audit of members of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons shows that demand for breast enlargements has fallen by almost a quarter.

Fall in procedures: Surgeons say the breast implant scandal has made people think more carefully having surgery for purely cosmetic reasons

Surgeons say the breast implant scandal in which tens of thousands of women were given cut-price breast implants filled with silicone meant for mattresses has made people think more carefully having surgery for purely cosmetic reasons.

Men are also paying for fewer enhancements than in the past – perhaps because the pinched and pulled metrosexual look is no longer in fashion.

BAAPS members carried out 45,406 operations last year – almost 5,000 fewer than the previous year.

Some 41,364 of the ops were carried out on women – a 9 per cent fall.

This was driven by a 23 per cent drop in the number of breast enlargements.

In 2014, just 8,609 women had the operation – compared with 11,135 in 2013.

And many of those that did have the op choose smaller implants that gave a more natural look.

With celebrities such as Jordan, who made her name on the strength of her surgically enhanced bust, also down-sizing, the days of ‘pumped up’ cleavage seem to be numbered.

The number of women having nose jobs, tummy tucks, brow lifts and ear corrections has also fallen.

Fall: The number of procedures undergone by women in 2014 was 9 per cent less than 2013

However, there has been a 10 per cent increase in the amount of liposuction done.

Some 4,042 men had cosmetic surgery last year – a 15 per cent drop on 2013.

Strikingly, the figures for all ten most popular ops fell or remained static.

Nose jobs, the most popular procedure for men in 2013, fell by 30 per cent.

And the number of operations to reduce male breasts or ‘moobs’ dropped by 10 per cent.

Eyelid surgery, in which tired, puffy and overhanging skin is removed, is now the most top reason for men going under the knife – but even it is less in demand than in the past.

The lack of male interest has been attributed to changing tastes, with the primped and preened metrosexual look falling out of fashion and manly, rugged races growing in popularity.

Surgeons say that women too are taking a more natural approach.

Rajiv Grover, former president of BAAPS, said: ‘Aesthetic preferences evolve naturally over time.

‘2014 saw men sporting bushy beards and women bushy eyebrow, as well as a number of “enhanced” celebrities downgrade their implant sizes.

‘In cosmetic surgery, the natural, less-is-more look is definitely on the rise, as patients opt to be “tweaked” rather than “tucked”.’

However, they admit that people are also much more safety conscious.

Jackie Lewis, a consultant plastic surgeon at the Cromwell Hospital, in London, said that the breast implant scandal ‘really did frighten people’.

As a result, prospective patients are doing more research into the potential risks.

Mrs Lewis said: ‘I think people are much more aware of the things that could possibly go wrong.

‘People are a lot more informed and sensible now, which is a good thing.’

BAAPS members do around a third of Britain’s cosmetic surgery, so the true number of operations carried out in 2014 will be around 140,000.
