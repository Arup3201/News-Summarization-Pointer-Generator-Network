Sportsmail's Matt Barlow has everything you need to know about Chelsea's new signing Mohamed Salah - dubbed the 'Egyptian Messi'

Chelsea's £11million move for Egypt winger Mohamad Salah is mired in controversy after it emerged he has twice refused to shake hands with Israeli players.

Owner Roman Abramovich, chairman Bruce Buck and director Eugene Tenenbaum are all Jewish and will be concerned by Salah’s actions.

The Basle star, who will join Chelsea this weekend after completing a medical, refused to shake the hands of Maccabi Tel Aviv’s players in both legs of their Champions League qualifiers last year.

Controversy: New Chelsea signing Mohamad Salah refused to shake Maccabi Tel Aviv players' hands in both Champions League qualifiers last year, instead using his fist

Done deal: Chelsea have signed Basle's Mohamed Salah, who has scored twice against them this season

Jose Mourinho was quick to play down the incident on Friday. 'It's not a concern. We know the club Chelsea is. I know the manager I am,' he said.

'There are no problems with us. We know what owner we have and the variety of players we have. We can help a young boy grow up and be stable.'

Before the clash with Maccabi at St 
Jakob-Park on July 30, Salah left his boots by the side of the pitch and
 avoided the customary pre-match handshake by going to the touchline to 
change into them. Basle won the game 1-0 and flew to Israel for the 
return leg on August 6.

Salah,
 21, then avoided the customary handshake with Maccabi’s players before 
kick-off, but clenched his fist instead to make contact with each member
 of the opposition.

He went
 on to score his side’s second goal on the way to a 3-3 draw that 
ensured Basle qualified for the Champions League group stages under 
impressive coach Murat Yakin.

Salah’s actions will cause some 
discomfort to Chelsea’s hierarchy. Abramovich is a frequent visitor to 
Israel and sponsors many charitable causes in the country.

But Salah would counter any suggestion of anti-Semitism, saying he felt pressurised to appease some extreme sections of the Egyptian community.

Despite his controversial behaviour, Chelsea intend to press ahead and confirm his signing after the sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United for £37m. They have agreed a fee with Basle and the move will be completed as soon as Salah has passed a medical in Switzerland.

Salah is a regular in the Egypt national team and has scored 17 times in 27 appearances.

He came to Chelsea’s attention last 
season with some mercurial performances in the Europa League against 
Tottenham and later against Rafa Benitez’s side in the semi-final, when 
he scored in the second leg.

Salah was also on target against Chelsea in both of this season’s Champions League group games against Jose Mourinho’s side.

During his career with Basle he scored 20 times in 78 games and his form in front of goal has helped him win a move to Stamford Bridge.

Well-known threat: Salah also scored for Basle in last season's Europa League semi-final against Chelsea

If you can’t stop ’em, buy ’em, right?

Seems so. Chelsea lost home and away against Basle in the Champions League this season, with Salah on target in each game. He scored the only goal at St Jakob-Park having out-sprinted Branislav Ivanovic.

So, quick then?

Sure is. He is comfortable on either wing, has good balance, sound technique, dribbles well, goes past defenders, has terrific acceleration and is especially dangerous on the break. He also bears a passing resemblance in looks and busy style to Jermaine Pennant.

But he’s better than Jermaine Pennant, right?

There’s probably more purpose and end product, granted, and he gave Ashley Cole a torrid time at Stamford Bridge. Salah has responded to subsequent steps up in class through the European competitions.

So, why hasn’t he been snapped up sooner?

He has been heavily scouted by PL teams. Liverpool were keen but Chelsea have been able to scrutinise his progress since the teams met in last year’s Europa League semi-final.
