From exam stress and homework struggles to friendship woes, middle school can be a difficult time. 

But last week, nearly 150  eighth graders in Massachusetts had their spirits lifted after walking into school in the morning - only to find kind-hearted Post-it notes stuck to each one of their lockers.

The handwritten notes, reading 'You are beautiful', were placed on lockers around Ipswich Middle School in  Ipswich last Friday by a mystery well-wisher. Not a single eighth grader was left out.

'It was sort of a boost,' said student Tovah Lockwood. 'A warm hug. It’s a nice gesture.' Another, Charlize Vermaak, added: 'I had this really dumb smile on my face. I couldn’t stop smiling.'

And one unnamed student said: 'It made everyone’s day.'

Within a few hours, some of the delighted 149 students had unstuck their notes and moved them on to the lockers of students whom they deemed particularly in need of support and kindness.

One of these students was Eric Anderson, whose family home at 62 Central St burned down three weeks ago. Speaking to CBS Boston, Eric said of the gesture: 'It’s still good that people care'.

Before Friday morning, the anonymous messenger had asked teacher Christina Ciarametaro if they could write and stick the notes to eighth graders' lockers without any security issues, it is reported.

A good morning: A female eighth grader opens her locker amid nearly 150 'You are beautiful' Post-it notes

After gaining permission, the person then likely spent more than an hour and a half handwriting the 'You are beautiful' notes, before posting them around the school, situated in the city's High Street.

Ms Ciarametaro told Wicked Local: [The students] were like little kids at Christmas and those who had lockers around the corner rushed to see if they had a similar message on their lockers.'

She added: 'It was one of the most powerful experiences I have been part of at IMS in 10 years.'

Ms Ciarametaro said she would not disclose the identity of the well-wisher. But she revealed that some of the teachers at the middle school know who it is, while others 'don't want to know' .

Principal: School principal, Dave Fabrizio (pictured), said the gesture - which has been deemed 'beautiful', 'amazing' and 'moving' by social media users - is what matters, not the identity of the mystery well-wisher

School: One week on, the Post-it notes are apparently still stuck to lockers at Ipswich Middle School (above)

School principal, Dave Fabrizio, said  the gesture - which has been deemed 'beautiful', 'amazing' and 'moving' by social media users in recent days - is what matters, not the identity of the individual.

'If each child looked at it in a different way and said "Boy somebody cares about me" or "I’m going to have a better day because of it" the message is all you need,' said Mr Fabrizio.

One week on, the Post-it notes are still believed to be stuck to lockers at the school.
