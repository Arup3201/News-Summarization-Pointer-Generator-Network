Two lucky Cincinnati residents each won $1million because they have the same name.

Kevin Lewis, both of them, were awarded a $1million prize after the Horseshoe Casino, in Cincinnati, OH., Saturday called their name as the winners of a promotion and failed to immediately realize the wrong Kevin Lewis' life was changed .

After realizing the wrong Kevin Lewis had claimed the prize, the casino decided to ‘do the right thing’ and pay both men.

And the winner is...: Kevin Lewis! Just, not this one, the other one

The real Kevin Lewis: This Kevin Lewis is the real winner, but the casino paid both men the prize

‘This was our blunder,’ Kevin Kline, casino senior vice president and general manager said in a statement. ‘So, consistent with our commitment to do the right thing for our guests, Horseshoe awarded a $1 million prize to each of the men.’

Awarded as part of a $3million Summer Giveaway promotion, when Kevin Lewis’ name was called and he appeared on-stage, he was awarded a giant check and took a picture with casino staff.

Only when going through a more detailed verification did Horseshoe realize the mistake.

‘A gentleman whose named they called, Kevin Lewis, was in the crowd, came forward and was given his jumbo check,’ spokesperson Jennifer Kulczycki told ABC News. ‘Then as the local leadership team moved on to do the secondary verification process, the team realized it had made a blunder.’

The ‘real’ Kevin Lewis was also the same age, also engaged, a casino regular and a city resident, Kulczycki told ABC, declining to comment on the verification.

‘There were a lot of similarities between the two gentlemen that led to confusion on our end,’ Kulczycki told the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Contestants entered the promotion by swiping loyalty cards each day at a kiosk inside the casino, according to the Enquirer, which added that additional entries could be made through points built up by gambling.

Both winners have declined to do media interviews, and an attempt by MailOnline to reach a Horseshoe Casino spokesperson was unsuccessful.

The final $1million prize will be awarded September 1, according to reports.
