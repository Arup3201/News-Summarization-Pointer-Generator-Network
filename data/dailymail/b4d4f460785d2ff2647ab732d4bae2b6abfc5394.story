In ship-shape: Noelle Reno

One might find it hard to believe Fashion TV star Noelle Reno has 
any imperfections.

But, despite  a regular gym routine and a healthy 
diet, the socialite was self-conscious of her ‘wobbly’ tummy.

Now, she says she has ditched the Spanx – after ‘fabulous’ results from a flab-zapping treatment.

Noelle,
 31, booked six Velashape sessions with Brazilian doctor Ariel Haus at 
his Harley Street clinic.

The treatment – which costs from £190 – 
involves a probe that emits radio-frequency energy, a type of heat, 
while suctioning fatty areas and tightening skin.

‘My tummy and love
 handles are my stubborn areas and this treatment really shifted the 
fat,’ says Noelle, partner of tycoon Scot Young – once imprisoned for 
not playing ball with judges during his toxic divorce, with his former 
wife Michelle.

‘Even my boyfriend said my stomach looked much flatter.’

While most people claimed they 
would seek a diagnosis for themselves or a loved one,  12 per cent said 
they would prefer to be left in the dark if they were suffering from an 
incurable neurological disease.

‘I’d
 waste my life worrying about something out of my control,’ said one in 
the survey by health screening experts GE Healthcare.

Some
 forms of dementia can be detected before symptoms begin with gene 
tests, but the majority will be picked up once there are obvious signs 
and the disease has progressed.

There
 is a push for earlier screening, and many trials have shown if caught 
early the progression of many forms of the disease can be delayed.

Marc
 Wortmann, executive director of Alzheimer’s Disease International, 
said: ‘People fear becoming a burden on their friends and families and 
do not desire a diagnosis of dementia. However, without proper diagnosis
 they risk missing out on appropriate treatment.

It has taken the Continent by 
storm. Now the E-Fit, a mobile and breathable workout kit fitted with up
 to 20 electrodes, has reached the first gyms in the UK.

Sprinter Usain Bolt is already a devotee of the device, which uses electric stimulation to cause muscles to contract and relax.

The kit is now being promoted for anyone wanting to boost their performance and fitness levels in sports.

The maker claims that by simulating the muscle movement that would occur during normal exercise, a  20-minute session is equal to a full hour’s workout.

Count yourself lucky if you bagged an office with a window.

Office
 workers exposed to natural daylight sleep for longer, have a better 
quality of sleep, are more physically active and have a better overall 
quality of life, says research.

The study involved 49 day-shift office workers, 27 with windowless offices and 22 who with office windows. T

heir
 exposure to daylight, activity and sleep was measured with a device 
worn on the wrist, while quality of life was self-reported.

The
 employees with windows received  173 per cent more white light exposure
 during the working day and slept on average 46 minutes more than their 
windowless colleagues.

The
 research findings at America’s  Northwestern Medicine and the 
University of Illinois, Urbana, were published in the Journal  Of 
Clinical Sleep Medicine.

No one likes being laughed at. But if you are one of the  13 per cent of the population who actually have a phobia about it, your heart could suffer.

Gelotophobia,
 the fear of being laughed at or a misperception of other people’s 
expressions of cheerfulness, is linked to slowing of the heartbeat, 
anxiety, loneliness and depression, says research.

As social animals, we seek acceptance and avoid rejection, but we differ in how we react to cues of social rejection.

In
 a study, people with and without gelotophobia performed mental 
arithmetic for five minutes. While working they were interrupted by two 
insulting statements via an intercom. Later, laughter was delivered 
through the intercom, as if by accident.

The heart rates of the phobics slowed for several seconds, said researchers from the University of Graz in Austria.
