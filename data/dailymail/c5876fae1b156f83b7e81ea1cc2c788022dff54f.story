A woman who developed anorexia after obsessing over stick-thin celebrities has beaten the illness - by being crowned Miss Toned Figure in a  bodybuilding tournament.

Charlotte MacGill, 26, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, would pore over pictures of painfully thin models and celebrities such as Victoria Beckham.

She would then starve herself and exercise to excess in a bid for an elusive 'thigh-gap'.

But as her weight dropped below eight stone, her health deteriorated.

She became depressed and suffered skin problems, thinning hair and bad breath. 

It was only when she started a job as a physiotherapist and took up weight training that she managed to turn her life around.

Charlotte MacGill, now 26, says taking up bodybuilding saved her from anorexia. She is pictured above at her lowest weight, when she would starve herself and exercise to excess in a bid for an elusive 'thigh-gap'

Now Ms MacGill has become a muscly transformation of her former self, winning regional, national and global bodybuilding competitions.

She said: 'I became really body conscious when I was 16 and started going to aerobics with my mum.

'Suddenly I was desperate to look like celebrities like Britney Spears who had washboard stomachs and Victoria Beckham with her slim thighs.

'But bodybuilding changed my life - I know how to exercise properly now and can't believe how unhealthy I was before.'

As a teenager, Ms MacGill became influenced by airbrushed models and slim celebrities in magazines and strived to look exactly like them.

In particular she craved a 'thigh gap' and washboard stomach. At 18 she joined a gym and became addicted to exercise.

She said: 'I just wanted to run any excess weight off. I ran six days a week. 

'My goal was always to stay below eight stone, so you could see my ribs and I'd have a 'thigh gap'.

'For more than two years, I worked out religiously at the gym but didn't know what I was doing or how to achieve what I wanted. I was desperate for the size zero body shape I saw in magazines.'

Still not happy with the way she looked, she started dieting in the hope of gaining the 'perfect' figure.

Her addiction continued while she studied sport rehabilitation at the University of Bolton, with the added strain of the typical student lifestyle on her body.

She said: 'When I went on nights out with friends, I'd binge on drinks as well as takeaways. That way, I could convince myself I wasn't anorexic.

'We'd get junk food after leaving a nightclub but I'd feel guilty afterwards and have to run even further on the treadmill.

'In fact, the takeaways were probably the only thing stopping me from becoming dangerously thin. I was so hungry sometimes that I would binge-eat on cakes and sweets. 

'A couple of times, I made myself sick and that's when I realised I had lost control.

'It wasn't an eating disorder, but it was starting to become one.'

Ms Mac Gill starved herself and exercised to excess from the age of 16. She suffered side effects like thinning hair, bad breath, spots and I sometimes became depressed about life. She is pictured (left and right) as a teenager when her eating disorder began

She added: 'I would just repeat the diet every day and I started to suffer side effects like thinning hair, bad breath, spots and I sometimes became depressed about life.

'Looking back, it's clear that I did have an eating disorder but I didn't see it then.'

After graduating, Ms MacGill got a job as a physiotherapist in her hometown of Bolton and her obsession with exercise didn't go unnoticed by her boss.

Worried that she had a warped body image and was in no position to help rehabilitate their clients, he asked her to write down her daily diet.

She said: 'He said my diet was shocking and told me I should stop running. He gave me an eating plan to increase my calories and got me doing weight training four times a week.

'He introduced a lot more healthy carbohydrates into my diet and tripled the amount I was eating.

'I was really worried I was going to get fat but I knew he knew what he was talking about. I put all my trust in him.

'I had porridge or muesli for breakfast, lots of rice and chicken, sweet potatoes, low fat rice pudding and bananas.'

She warns  success in bodybuilding competitions doesn't come easy - it requires months of strict dieting and training. Now, she hopes to inspire women to aim to be toned and healthy, not skinny

Within just two months, Ms MacGill was so pleased with the transformation in her body shape, she decided she wanted to try out for a competition run by the National Amateur Bodybuilders' Association (NABBA).

She said: 'My boss was amazed when I got serious about bodybuilding so quickly, but I wanted something to focus on. 

'I was building muscle as well as fat and I felt so much better in myself, so I entered my first competition eight weeks later.

She won her first regional competition in May 2012, but after the losing the next one, took some time out from competing to train properly.

In October 2014, she entered three competitions in the 'toned figure' category and was crowned champion in all three - including the global title. 

But she warns the success doesn't come easy - it requires months of strict dieting and training. 

She said: 'I eat lots of white fish and green vegetables, oats and rice cakes. I'm very strict with myself and don't have any treats at all. 

MsMacGill says she has the full support of her boyfriend, who is also a bodybuilder. Both plan to compete next year to add to the regional, national and globlal titles Ms MacGill has already won

'But, when I'm not getting ready to compete, I pig out and eat whatever I like. I love pick'n'mix and chocolate and have such a sweet tooth.'

'Knowing you have a goal in mind makes it all worth it, though. You get a thrill from it - it feels amazing to build your own physique. I get lots of compliments on my figure and lots of requests for arm wrestles!'

Ms MacGill has the full support of her boyfriend, fellow physiotherapist John Ramsay, 28, who is also a bodybuilder.

'We're like a normal couple and go out for meals together when we're not preparing for a competition, but when we are, we have to be careful about what we're eating. 

'We cook each other meals and say, 'How many grams of protein would you like?'

Both plan to compete again next year and Ms MacGill believes her transformation isn't over yet.

She said: 'My family and friends are really supportive and follow what I do. They're so proud that I'm healthy now and I've changed my body image.

'Obsessing over unrealistic celebrity images was really damaging to me as a teenager so I hope that my new body shape will inspire teenage girls to concentrate on being toned and healthy rather than skinny.'
