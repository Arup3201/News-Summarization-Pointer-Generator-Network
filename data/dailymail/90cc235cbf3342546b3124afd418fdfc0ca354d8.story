A New Zealand team of designers has created a desk made out of 100 per cent recyclable material that can be adjusted to standing or sitting height and then packed-up and taken anywhere. 

Designed by Refold, three recent university graduates from Wellington - Fraser Callaway, Oliver Ward and Matt Innes - the Portable Cardboard Standing Desk is made entirely of cardboard and yet can hold up the weight of an adult.

Weighing only 6.5kg, it is designed to be fitted together in as little as two minutes and then folded down into its self-formed carry case.

Made out of 100 per cent recyclable materials, the desk can be adjusted to sitting or standing height 

It was created by Refold: three recently graduated university students from Wellington named Fraser Callaway, Oliver Ward and Matt Innes

'It is made completely from a single material – 7mm twin cushion kraft cardboard, which means it's 100% recyclable and can be put out with your household recycling,' Refold explains.

'Each leg is constructed from three pieces of cardboard laminated together with environmentally friendly glue.

'For maximum strength the flute direction alternates with a horizontal flute sandwiched between two verticals.'

However, one of the most important design aspects of the desk according to its creators is its ability to be easily adjusted for its users to either sit or stand.

Refold says one of the desk's most important features is the ability to allow users to stand 

'Research shows that when you're standing you're more likely to engage with others, share your ideas and work together,'they said

As recent studies have suggested that sitting down for hours at a time each day is leading to heart disease and early deaths, Refold have put forward their design as an easy solution.

But the desk's flexibility also offers a range of options for work places that want to increase the productivity and collaboration in their spaces.

'Research shows that when you're standing you're more likely to engage with others, share your ideas and work together,' Refold claims, adding that their desks can be re-arranged and moved to suit any environment or space in moments.

It also allows for flexible working areas to be created and is suitable for a variety of spaces 

The team have also been working alongside UNICEF New Zealand  to help improve education in the Pacific Islands by trialling the desks in less fortunate schools 

The inspiration behind the innovative design came to the team when they were trying to organise work experience for graphic design students who were transitioning from university into the workplace. 

The program was repeatedly road-blocked by studios that claimed to love the concept, but have no physical desk space for the students to participate in their activities.

Frustrated, they created the recyclable desks which are made through digital fabrication – allowing each desk to have the option of drastically differing in its design in order to fit to individuals and their needs.

The inspiration behind the idea came from the team's inability to organise work experience for graphic design students due to studios claiming they did not have the physical desk space for the students to participate 

Weighing only 6.5kg, it is designed to be fitted together in as little as two minutes and then folded down into its self-formed carry case

The team have since recognised the opportunities that a flexible desk can not only provide in an office space, but in an educational setting. 

'We see these desks as a product to instigate positive change in the schools of those who are less fortunate,' the team have said.

'We have been working with UNICEF New Zealand to help improve education in the Pacific Islands by trialling our desks in schools.'
