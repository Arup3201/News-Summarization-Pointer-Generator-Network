Pastor Maldonado is not expecting his current bitter frustration to ease over the course of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix.

Six grands prix into his maiden campaign with Lotus - after spending two seasons at Williams - Maldonado currently finds himself at the foot of the 22-driver championship table.

The team's problems have been numerous, but Maldonado appears to have encountered his fair share, initially retiring in the first two races in Australia and Malaysia.

After at least seeing the chequered flag in the three grands prix that followed in China, Bahrain and Spain, with a high of 14th, a new low then arose in Monaco where Maldonado failed even to start.

Normally renowned for his strong performances around the streets of the principality, Maldonado said: 'I was very disappointed because I was expecting to be in the points and the car did feel strong.

'The chances in Monaco are always very high, and I was ready to do a great race, but unfortunately it was not to be.

'As you saw, we were not the only team to have technical problems at the last race, however we just need to work harder to try to solve all of the small issues and get better with each race.

'They are frustrating, absolutely, but we are getting stronger and stronger each time the car goes out on track.'

At present the normally volatile Venezuelan is remaining calm as he added: 'When you have a hard time it is vital to be completely focused on trying to solve the problems.

'I'm trying to do better from my side and also to help the engineers improve the car.

'This is a crucial moment for the team, approaching the middle of the season. We need to push very hard to recover what we lost at the beginning.

'We always knew it was going to be tough to start with, but the key is not to panic.

'We'll just keep our heads down and quietly work harder, do more and do better to catch up, and overtake the other teams.

'We're capable of it, there's no doubt about that, and while it's always frustrating not to be on the podium where we belong, this is part of the story.

'It's very easy to just give up, but I think it will make us stronger in the end.

'There's a cool quote I heard - 'there's no shortcut to any place worth going'. That's pretty true I think.'

Unfortunately for Maldonado, points - never mind a podium - may again be hard to come by in Montreal this weekend as the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve does not suit the current Lotus.

'Top speed and slow corners are probably the weakest points of our car now, and unfortunately Canada has long straights followed by low-speed corners,' said Maldonado.

'It could be a difficult weekend for the team. We are not expecting to be at the top, simply because of the type of track and how we understand our car and its performance strengths and weaknesses.

'But anything can happen and our guys are all working very hard to adapt the car to find more traction in the slow corners and squeeze out some more top speed.'
