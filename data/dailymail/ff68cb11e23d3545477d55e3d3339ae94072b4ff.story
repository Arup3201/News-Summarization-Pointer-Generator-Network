A film portraying Nick Clegg’s role in the creation of the first Coalition government since the Second World War has been announced – sparking ridicule in Westminster.

The one-off Channel 4 programme – quickly dubbed ‘Nick Clegg the movie’ – will be set in the days following the 2010 election when backroom deals helped shut Labour out of power for the first time since 1997.

The revelation sparked speculation in Westminster over which Hollywood actor would play Mr Clegg - a former university Thespian himself – and his glamorous Spanish wife Miriam.

A Lib Dem source close to the Deputy Prime Minister suggested there was already one superstar in the running. The source said: ‘That would explain why Johnny Depp has been calling.’

The Spanish actress Penelope Cruz was also suggested as a leading contender to play Miriam.

But Mr Clegg may fancy a go playing himself in the movie. He once played the prince in an amateur pantomime of Sleeping Beauty at university.

Mr Clegg has previously boasted about his days as a wannabe actor.

He said: 'Acting was a great love of mine and I never would have caught the idea of drama unless I'd been encouraged to do so in school.'

Speaking to the acting magazine The Stage he added: 'When I was younger, I had the privilege of performing alongside others who have since gone on to lead very successful acting careers.'

Mr Clegg also appeared in a Westminster School play with Helena Bonham Carter. 

A series of online spoofs were mocked up showing the Deputy Prime Minister in a series of famous films

Playwright James Graham, whose National Theatre play This House was set in the dying days of James Callaghan's Labour government, said Mr Clegg was pivotal in a ‘historic’ moment in British politics.

He said: ‘In May 2010, British politics was faced with a dilemma it hadn't had to face in peacetime for over 75 years.

‘The public were asked “Who should govern?” and they came back with the answer “We don't know”.

‘Those historic, dramatic few days put personalities at the heart of politics - and the choices made, I believe, changed the face of British politics forever.

‘What we try to capture in this drama is the tension, the high stakes, and the frequent farcical and absurd nature of what happens when a power is wrangled, negotiated and fought over like children trading cards in the playground.’

The 90-minute film, with the working title ‘Coalition’, is the latest in a string of political dramas on the channel including the Bafta-winning Mo about Mo Mowlam and The Deal, which starred Michael Sheen and David Morrissey as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

The Lib Dems tonight asked on Twitter who should be chosen to play the Deputy Prime Minister. One mock up image on Twitter suggested Benedict Cumberbatch would be a good choice

Online spoof Twitter account 'General Boles' - a parody of the Tory MP Nick Boles - suggested the final scene of the Nick Clegg Movie would see him at the wheel of the Titanic

The channel is also making a 10-part spy drama - called Opposite Number - about agents fighting a secret war in the closed world of North Korea.

Its writer, Matt Charman, said: ‘North Korea is one of the last truly impenetrable nations on the planet, and one of the most dangerous for the West.

‘I wanted to write a drama that could blow the lid off our understanding of who we think the North Korean people are and what their government truly wants.’
