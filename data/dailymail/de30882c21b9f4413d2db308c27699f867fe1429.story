This is the shocking moment a daredevil risks death as he clings on to a tram that is travelling at 30 miles per hour.

Crouching low to avoid being spotted by the driver, the man is clearly seen holding on to the tram's windscreen wipers as it zips along past cars.  

The tram surfer's idiotic actions were captured in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, by Paul Pashley who filmed the shocking scene. 

Daredevil: The man is clearly seen clinging to the tram's windscreen wipers as it travels through Sheffield. Paul Pashley, who filmed the scene, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw it'

Dangerous: The man was hitching a free ride as cars travelled in the opposite direction. Paul said: 'If he had been fallen off and been hit by a car he would have been done'

Paul, a 35-year-old singer, said: 'I was on my way to my gig and we came across a 'tram surfer' en route. 

'I couldn't believe it when I saw it, I had to film it.

'He was obviously quite skilful as you could see he was resting on the bumper, holding on to the wiper blades and had his head down so the driver couldn't see him.'

The tram's final destination is believed to be the Cathedral stop in Sheffield city centre.

Shocked Paul added: 'I reckon it was going at least 30 miles per hour and if he had been fallen off and been hit by a car he would have been done. We made sure to stay a decent distance away.' 

Expert: The man is clearly no stranger to 'tram surfing' and was spotted keeping his heads 

The man clung on to the tram for some time, and appeared to be an expert as he continued on his journey.

Paul added: 'Saying that, he seemed so calm and relaxed. I couldn't believed we missed the bit just after the tram stopped.

'He jumped off, stretched his legs and arms, then when he heard the bell jumped back on, giving us a thumbs up as he moved off.'

A spokeswoman for Stagecoach Supertram, who run the service, said: 'This is very dangerous behaviour that should not be promoted. Safety is our absolute priority and this kind of stunt is extremely irresponsible.'
