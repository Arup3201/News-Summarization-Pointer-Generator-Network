Cara Delevigne may have dominated the headlines and social media over the past two years, but with her stunning looks and sought-after style, all eyes are moving to her older sister, Poppy.

The middle Delevingne sister, 27, is an ambassador for Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld personally made her wedding dress when she married James Cook in May.

A self-confessed party girl, Poppy now has as many photographers chasing her and designers flocking to her than her supermodel little sister - and is fast-becoming just as famous.

In an interview with Giles Hattersley of Sunday Times Style, Poppy admits that she needs two rooms of her Notting Hill home to house all the clothes she is sent by top designers.

Starting her modelling career at 18, she tells the publication that it was so easy to be overlooked that the way to make herself stand out, was to go out.

'I like to work all day and go out all night then, every couple of months, I crash,' says Poppy.

'It's quite shocking if 7pm rolls around and I've got no plans.'

Despite being best friends with Sienna Miller (the two shared an apartment in New York) and having Superdry sponsor her hen party at Coachella music festival in California in April, when Poppy 'crashes' she does it just like the rest of us: with comfort food and TV.

Runway success: Poppy has been modelling since she was 18, for the likes of Louis Vuitton, Anya Hindmarch and Julien Macdonald

'I need two days of lying in a bed large enough to swim in, eating cans of baked beans and watching 17 episodes of Friends,' she says.

Socialite Poppy, whose father, Charles, is a successful property developer, had a privileged upbringing. Her elder sister is Chloe Delevingne, 29, who lives life a little less in front of the cameras than Cara and Poppy.

Poppy grew up in a mansion in Belgravia and attended school at esteemed Bedales, where Daniel Day-Lewis, Minnie Driver and various Royals have been educated.

A successful model, Poppy was signed to Storm by Sarah Dukas - the very same eye that spotted Kate Moss - in 2008.

She has since modelled for Laura Ashley, Anya Hindmarch, Mango, Alberta Ferretti and Burberry, and walked for Julien Macdonald.

She was the face of the Louis Vuitton summer 2012 collection, handpicked by Marc Jacobs himself.

Never one to do things in small measure, Poppy had not one but two wedding ceremonies to James.

The first was in England where she wore the gorgeous white Chanel gown and had 13 bridesmaids, including sister Cara, also dressed in Chanel.

Two weeks later, she jetted off to Marrakesh for the second ceremony, where she wore a custom-made dress by Pucci (one of her favourite designers) and guests included Suki Waterhouse, Alexa Chung and Georgia May Jagger.

But designers aside, Poppy is has no desire to shun high street brands.

She was recently pictured in a TopShop skirt, and told Elle magazine last year: 'I love high-street fashion.

'I’m all about Topshop and Zara – even American Apparel. American Apparel also does the best bras – they’re amazing.'
