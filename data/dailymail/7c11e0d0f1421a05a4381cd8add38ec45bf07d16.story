Hard-up: British families with a stay-at-home mum are worse off than in most of the developed world because of tough tax rules, researchers say

Families with stay-at-home mothers are worse off in the UK than in most countries across the developed world, new research has revealed.

The tax burden on couples with two children but only one breadwinner is much higher because the UK fails to take family responsibilities as seriously as other rich nations, critics said today.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has looked at 33 of the world's most developed countries and found that the UK's tax system hinders families with one working parent, the majority of which are married couples.

Across OECD countries the average tax rate for a typical family with one 
stay-at-home parent and one working person is around six per cent, but is nearly ten per cent 
in the UK.

This is because there are not the significant tax breaks for them that are found in most other nations and can cost Britons thousands more in tax every year.

It is believed that Chancellor George Osborne may consider a new tax allowance for married couples in his upcoming budget to try to rectify this inequality.

The extra tax break could save millions of people up to £1,600 a year.

In the OECD study researchers also found that a single person on the national average salary of £34,000 is better off than 83 per cent of the UK population after tax. But a couple with two children and a full time parent is only 40 per cent better off after tax.

Today the Government was urged by CARE, the Christian social policy charity who helped finance the research, to adapt Britain's tax rules to help hard-working families who are currently losing out.

'UK one earner married couples with children carry a far greater tax burden that the OECD or EU average wage. We are out of line with all developed economies in ignoring the family,' CARE chief executive Nola Leach told the Daily Telegraph.

'At all income points one earner families are lower in the income distribution than singles and couples without children. This cruel anomaly in the tax system is hurting families at a time when they need all the support they can get.'

The Government is planning to raise the personal income tax allowance to £10,000 but Mrs Leach says that this is not necessarily the best way to support low and middle income families as it still favours the rich.

Former Tory Chancellor under Margaret Thatcher, Lord Lawson, will launch the report tomorrow and also claim that the Coalition is hurting many British families and not helping them enough.

It is still women who predominantly stay at home in the majority of British families with one breadwinner.  

But the number of house-husbands has tripled over the past 15 years and 14 per cent of families with children now have a father with the main responsibility for looking after the children.
