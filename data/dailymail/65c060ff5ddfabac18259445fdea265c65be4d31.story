Soaring above a weight of history, the Dambusters squadron has flown its final mission before being disbanded for only the third time in its existence.

The RAF set up 617 Squadron in 1943 for only one purpose - to carry out Operation Chastise, breaching dams near German factories in the dead of night by using experimental 'bouncing bombs'.

But 71 years, five new fleets of planes and thousands of missions later, the squadron is still at the forefront of British military operations.

Historic: Jets from the famous 617 Squadron fly from Khandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, for the final time before it is disbanded for only the third time in its history

Sunset on an era: Wing Commander David Athurton, 617's current leader, told British Forces News: 'There's a degree of sadness. It's quite a poignant time'

Saying farewell: Squadron Leader Mark Jackson carries out pre-flight checks before his final flight aboard the aircraft in Afghanistan. They will soon return to Scotland

Based at RAF Lossiemouth near Inverness, Scotland, the squadron is about to receive its sixth new fleet of planes, replacing its aging Tornado GR4s with the Lightning II stealth fighter which is due to be introduced in 2016.

Until then 617 Squadron will be no more. Yesterday crew members took their last flight aboard 617's current fleet - from Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan.

The air force's most famous squadron took over aerial reconnaissance there in November and has flown more than 400 missions. Now its crew members will disperse to join other squadrons or become flight instructors.

Wing Commander David Athurton told British Forces News: 'There's a degree of sadness; it's quite a poignant time.

'I'm glad we're able to draw this chapter of this squadron's history to a close on operations. I think that's fitting.'

Despite the very modern nature of the
 task in hand, the crew could not forget their past - the image of water
 pouring from a broken dam is inscribed on their badge.

Weight of history: It is hard for the crew to forget the significance of their squadron number. The image of a burst dam is inscribed on their badges

Pride: 617 Squadron now uses Tornado jets (left), a leap in technology from the famous bouncing bombs designed by Barnes Wallis (right), who was later knighted

Born into battle at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, with just a few weeks' notice of its star mission, the unit has been through several transformations to keep up with the times. It began with Lancaster bombers and received Lincolns the year after the war ended.

In 1952 defence chiefs provided Canberras, the first jet-powered light bomber to enter mass production in Britain. The Squadron then disbanded in 1955, re-entering service two and a half years later with a new fleet of Vulcans which lasted almost 30 years.

In 1981 it disbanded again to replace the Vulcan bombers with a fleet of Tornado GR1 jets, which were later upgraded to GR4s.

Although no mission would match the notoriety of the Dambusters, 617 Squadron saw service for many high-profile tasks.

It made the first use of the RAF's cruise missile Storm Shadow during the invasion of Iraq in April 2003.

Vital: The huge dams on the German River Ruhr protected industrial heartlands for the Nazi war effort. Breaching the dams in May 1943 was a crucial blow

Rushed: Dr Barnes Wallis (right) had very little time to test his bouncing bomb, which skimmed the surface of the water before impacting low on the dams. It was tested off the British coast in top secret conditions, so confidential that even Wing Commander Gibson was not told the full nature of his mission until shortly before

The Squadron was formed on March 21, 1943, with Wing Commander Guy Gibson tasked to recruit top fliers from other squadrons.

For weeks not even he was told of the task - only that it was essential to be able to fly low over water.

They trained by flying over the dams and reservoirs of Derbyshire while the bouncing bombs, designed by Barnes Wallis, were tested off the Kent coast.

The crews were tasked with breaching four huge dams on the river Ruhr, the heart of German industry and crucial to the Nazi war effort.

In just a few precious weeks, top-secret tests had shown the bomb had to be dropped at exactly 220mph, 60ft above the water in order to skim across the surface.

Appeal: Part of 617 Squadron's fame can be put down to the 1955 blockbuster The Dam Busters, which immortalised the raid with the help of the polished glamour of the silver screen. Right, the squadron's badge depicting a breached dam with water pouring from it was approved by King George VI in 1944, and has remained ever since

Nineteen modified Lancaster bombers flew into enemy territory on the night of May 16, with Gibson deliberately using his own plane to draw away German aircraft while his team undertook their task.

Eight of the aircraft and their crews were lost, and two of the four dams - Mohne and Eder - were breached.

Upon their return, the crew were honoured for the danger they had faced, the short time they had to prepare and the audacity of what they had done.

The last surviving member from that night, Squadron Leader George 'Johnny' Johnson, 91, recently revealed how he celebrated - with a nice cup of tea.

The Tornado GR4 jets are now set to return to RAF Lossiemouth as the Dambusters story fades into memory for another two years, before it rises again, ready to fight another day.
