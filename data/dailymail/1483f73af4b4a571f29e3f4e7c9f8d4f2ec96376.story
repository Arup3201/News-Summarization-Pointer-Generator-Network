This is the gipsy couple who married ten minutes after a guest was murdered at their wedding.

Barney McGinley, 63, was shot in the chest at point-blank range outside the Catholic church in Northern Ireland where Jimmy O'Connor, 16, and Matilda McGinley, 17, were about to marry.

Another guest was shot in the arm and a friend slashed with a machete in the  village of Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh on Wednesday.

Police know the identity of the gunman, who is still on the run after fleeing the scene in a car, with sources suggesting the shooting was part of a long-standing feud between rival traveller families.

The young couple whose wedding day was marred by the brutal attack were encouraged to continue and walked up the aisle around 10 minutes after the murder.

Victim: Barney McGinley, 63, was shot in the chest at point-blank range outside the Catholic church in Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh

Mr McGinley was flown to hospital by air ambulance but could not be saved.  The other two men injured in the attack were not seriously injured but required hospital treatment.

Parish priest Father Michael King said he married the young couple at the request of the bride's mother after the mayhem outside left  one man dead and two injured. 

He said women sprinted into the church 'looking for shelter', screaming: 'There are shots, there are shots, there is somebody shooting'.

Father King said that the women and he had pleaded with the men to stop fighting in the church car park before the shooting.

He said: 'I was shocked by the events, I'm thinking about them ever since. But in another sense I'm not surprised because there is a subtext in traveller's weddings.' 

'There is always something very low simmering beneath the surface waiting to explode and it exploded and the circumstances were tragic.'

He added: 'Couples are getting married under 18, this lad was just over 16 and the girl was just over 17.

'The reason they come this way to Northern Ireland, because this bride was from Dublin and the groom was from the Midlands... the reason they came here to get married is because you can get marrie under 18 in Northern Ireland.

'In the south of Ireland you need to be 18, so that's why so many of them come up here'.

Dramatic day: The bride and members of the wedding party leave St Mary's Catholic Church in the rural village of Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, after the service

Police at the scene: The priest said there had been an 'altercation' in the car park before the bride arrived

Carry on: Father Michael King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned

Tributes have today poured in for the murdered man.

Cousin Willie McGinley wrote on Facebook: 'R.I.P Uncle Barney. Gone but will never be forgotten. Still can't believe he's gone. God only takes the best.'

Eileen Connors posted: 'Rest in peace Barney. May God welcome you into his kingdom where you'll have peace and happiness.'

Michaela Dinnegan added: 'R.I.P Barney. May you get the best bed in heaven and look over all your family and help them get through this hard time.'

The new couple were also praised online, with one saying of Matilda McGinley: 'I’ve seen brides but I have to give it to her she was the nicest bride'. Another said she looked beautiful. 

Probe: Forensics officers searched for clues around the grounds of St Mary's Catholic Church

Sinn Féin councillor Thomas O'Reilly told the Irish Daily Mail that there were rumours in the town that a 'jealous lover' turned up at the church but he ended up missing his intended target and shooting two other men instead.

He added: 'Everyone in the community is shocked. My condolences to the dead man's family and all injured but this happened next door to a primary school, this is of huge concern.

'People are arriving home from work this evening and no-one can believe what has happened. Apparently the bride was still in the church when the shooting took place,' added Mr O'Reilly.

Assembly member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Tom Elliott said the attack was 'horrific'.

'It is very worrying that certain people have access to firearms and are willing to use them for any reason,' he said.

'There is a significant onus on police to ensure that these criminals are caught and that the courts ensure they are locked up for a long period.'

Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Detective Chief Inspector Una Jennings, who is leading the murder investigation, urged those responsible to hand themselves in.

'What should have been a day of joy and celebration has been turned in to one of heartbreak and tragedy,' she said. 

'We are following a number of very definite lines of inquiry in this investigation, thanks to accounts of events outside the church before the wedding ceremony given to us by other guests. 

'We know who they are. It would be better for all concerned if they made themselves available to police as soon as possible so that we can build a complete picture of what happened yesterday and the background to those tragic events.'
