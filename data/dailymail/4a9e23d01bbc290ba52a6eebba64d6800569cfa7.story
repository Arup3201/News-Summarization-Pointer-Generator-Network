Eco-warrior: Prince Charles yesterday called on people to improve their health by looking after the planet, which had said needed treatment

Prince Charles yesterday called on people to improve their health by looking after the planet.

In a keynote address to the Royal Society in London, the prince said: 'Protect the health of the planet, protect our health. 

'Actions which are good for the planet are also good for human health.'

He added: 'Taking a more active approach to transport by walking and cycling and adopting healthy diets reduce greenhouse gas emissions and but also reduce rates of obesity, heart disease, cancer and more – saving lives and money.

'Reductions in air pollution also result, with separate and additional benefits, to human health. A healthy planet and healthy people are two sides of the same coin.' 

The event yesterday linked Charles's International Sustainability Unit and the World Health Organisation, bringing together health ministers, senior civil servants and health professionals.

The prince described the United Nations Climate Change Conference, to take place later this year, as one of our 'last opportunities' to keep a lid on global warming. 

'We can only pray that our sick planetary patient might be placed on a road to recovery, in the process bringing gains for human well-being,' he said.

'Failure to write the prescription, however, might leave us contemplating the death certificate instead.

'So, my fervent hope is that you can find the means to make the difference that our world so desperately needs.'

The heir to the throne went on to highlight research which described the phenomenon as 'the greatest threat to human health of the 21st century'.  

He said: 'I hardly need to tell you we are faced, I fear, as far as the problem of human-induced climate change is concerned, with a challenge of astonishing complexity.

'The fact of climate change is now accepted by every major scientific body in the whole world.

'The gravity and immediacy of the threat it poses to us and our children and grandchildren is also accepted by constituencies that can scarcely be accused of being part of some half-baked conspiracy dreamt up by extreme environmentalists intent on undermining capitalism.

'These constituencies include the UN, the World Bank; The Pentagon and the UK Ministry of Defence, the CIA, NSA. ... and, I'm happy to say, nurses and doctors.'

The issue of climate change will be one the main themes of the prince's visit with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, to the US next month when the couple will meet President Obama at the White House.
