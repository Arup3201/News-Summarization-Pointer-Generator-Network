Fascinating images have emerged from an Australian Aboriginal tribe's annual pilgrimage to their sacred sites along Queensland's western deserts.

Melbourne photographer Brook Mitchell documented the spiritual event of the Marrinyama men who embark on the journey each year as a way of keeping their local traditions and lore alive.

The men spend three months of their summer at bush camps near the desert outpost town of Cloncurry in Queensland's north-west, whereÂ  temperatures average in the high 40Cs.

They're also known as the 'Kangaroo Society' for the self-inflicted ceremonial marks cut into the arms of the men with sharp rock fragments to resemble the scratch from a kangaroo.

Mitchell said he was invited to follow the group led by Lance Sullivan, born Tjupurrula Maarij Tjarra and now elder of the Yalarrnga Nation, perform rituals such as the kangaroo and emu dances to wake up their ancestors.

'It was a powerful experience,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The society's desert rituals are equal parts age old tradition and self renewal, with the men all looking to their past for the strength to act as positive role models amongst troubled communities.

'As Lance asserted: "without our past we have no future, without our culture we have nothing".'

Mitchell said the men were strikingly dressed in their feathered headdresses - known as dhoeri - while they also mixed blood with the red earth to create paint for the caves at 'Majumba Ndia', also known as Kangaroo dreaming.

'The paintings were retouched and added to with paint made from a mixture of red ochre, water, blood and honey,' he said.

Mitchell was amazed to witness how determined these men were to keep their culture alive, even if it means inflicting severe pain in the process.
