An huge collection assembled by acclaimed actress of stage and screen, Lauren Bacall, who died in August 2014, is to go under the hammer at Bonhams in New York

Many of the pieces come from three of Bacall's residences, including the LA home she shared with her first husband, Humphrey Bogart.

Others come from  her country home in Amagansett and her New York apartment, which she shared with second husband, Jason Robards until 1969.

Highlights include six bronze maquettes by Henry Moore, Britain’s greatest 20th century sculptor and one of Bacall’s favourite artists.

Bacall’s admiration for Moore began in the 1950s while she was living in Los Angeles. After finally meeting the sculptor at his studio in 1975, she wrote: 'It was and will be ever a high point of my life ... [it was the] realization of a dream.'

Also included in the highlight exhibition are bronze sculptures by noted American artist, Robert Graham, whose works fascinated Bacall, and who was married to her close friend, Anjelica Huston.

She apparently referred to the three sculptures, all of which depict nude women in various poses, as her 'girls'.

Equally beautifully made is the jewellery collection, some of which was created by designer, Jean Schlumberger.

Particularly striking is an  18-carat yellow gold, enamel, cultured pearl, and rose diamond Mogul-inspired camel brooch by British jeweller, Elizabeth Gage. 

Unusually, the piece is accompanied by the original drawing and handwritten correspondence between Gage and Bacall.

Speaking about the tour, a spokesperson for Bonhams said: 'Bonhams is delighted to share with the public a rare insight into the world of Lauren Bacall, the accomplished collector. 

'Her collection is a truly a reflection of her extraordinary taste and remarkable life.’

Lauren Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske in Brooklyn in 1924. She attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, alongside Kirk Douglas, and supported herself by working as an usherette and a model. 

It was her work in modeling which led to her breakthrough: she was spotted by Diana Vreeland, then fashion editor of Harper’s Bazaar. 

Bacall soon appeared on the cover of Harper's, catching the attention of the celebrated director, Howard Hawks shortly after.

An amethyst, turquoise and diamond ring is expected to fetch £3,850 - £5,780

Hawks changed Bacall’s name to Lauren and took a chance on the inexperienced starlet, casting her in his adaption of Hemingway’s tale, To Have and Have Not. 

19-year-old Bacall was apparently so nervous, her head shook involuntarily, so she tilted her chin down to steady herself, with the result being that she looked up  at the camera. 

Her unusual style of delivery, combined with the script’s many innuendos, were to prove a winning formula.

The public was hooked on the chemistry between Bacall and Bogart - and the studio took advantage, casting them together in Key Largo, The Big Sleep and Dark Passage. 

The couple married in 1945, had two children, and stayed together until Bogart’s death in 1957. Bacall later had a third child with her second husband, Jason Robards.

Bacall also became an accomplished stage actress, receiving critical acclaim for her work in Cactus Flower, Applause, and Woman of the Year.

Nevertheless, she continued to make films and eventually appeared in more than 30, among them How to Marry a Millionaire and Murder on the Orient Express. 

The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996) - of which Barbra Streisand was director, producer and star - earned Bacall a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination.

In 2009, Bacall collected an Oscar in recognition of 'her central place in the golden age of motion pictures.'
