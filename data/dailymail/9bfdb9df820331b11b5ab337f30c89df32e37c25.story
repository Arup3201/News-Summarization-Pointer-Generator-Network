Investigators believe the missing pregnant wife of a California-based Marine may have been shot while hunting with a married ex-Marine with whom she was having an affair.

Court documents say that on the day she disappeared three weeks ago, 20-year-old Erin Corwin had planned to meet with Christopher Brandon Lee to spend a day together on a hunting trip, according to an affidavit obtained by The Desert Sun.

The detective's affidavit shows the investigation is focusing on married father-of-one Lee, 24, who may have been the father of Corwin's child.

The affidavit also states Lee's wife, Nichole Lee, told a friend police 'would never find the body' and that she scolded her husband for 'not being able to keep his lies 
straight when he was interviewed by detectives because he was dumb'.

Still missing: Erin Corwin, 20, disappeared on June 28, two weeks after discovering she was pregnant. Married to a Marine, she was allegedly having an affair with a fellow marine who lived on the same military base in Twentynine Palms, California

Arrested but released: Christopher Brandon Lee, 24, a recently discharged marine, was allegedly having an affair with Erin Corwin. He was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of having a 'destructive device' but released two days later. He has reportedly moved to Alaska

Newlyweds: Erin married Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin (pictured) two years ago, and they found out Erin was pregnant two weeks before she went missing

Base: The couple live at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms. Christopher Lee also lived at the base. Erin's abandoned car was found outside the site two days after she was reported missing

Lee, who volunteered at a horse ranch 
with Corwin, was arrested July 4 on suspicion of possession of a 
destructive device.

The device turned out to be a potato gun, but Lee was held for two days before being released on bail.

Authorities wouldn't say if the two cases are connected.

Lee maintains he was not with Corwin on the day she went missing, but confirmed he was hunting in Joshua Tree National Park.

He also told police that he had kissed Corwin, but denied having a sexual relationship with her, according to the documents.

Corwin was last seen on June 28 bound for Joshua Tree National Park while three months pregnant.

Her husband, Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, reported her missing the following day.

Two days later, her car was found outside
 the gate of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine 
Palms, where the couple and Lee live.

Court documents show that Corwin had admitted to a friend she was having an affair with Lee in a series of text messages.

Corwin said in the texts she had planned an outing with Lee for the day she disappeared.

Lee was arrested earlier this month after a search warrant was served at a home in Yucco Valley.

He was then released on bail two days later, the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department said in a statement.

Wife: Nichole Lee (pictured), who is married to Christopher Lee, allegedly told a friend that police would 'never find' Corwin's body

Moved: Following his arrest earlier this month, Christopher Lee, 24, reportedly moved to Alaska

Family: Christopher and Nichole Lee have a daughter together

Ranch: Both Corwin and Lee kept horses at the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch in Yucca Valley

Mystery: Erin Corwin was on her way to 
Joshua Tree National Park (pictured) - about five miles from the Marine Corps base - 
when she went missing three weeks ago

A day after that, he was honorably discharged after six years in the Marine Corps, the Desert Sun reported.

While interviewing Isabella Megli, the owner of White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch, where Corwin and Lee keep horses, authorities learned that Lee's wife had made several comments to her about the investigation.

'Nichole told Isabella that without a body the detectives did not have a case against them and the detectives would never find the body,' the court document's said.

Nichole also said investigators had searched her residence but 'missed something' because they didn't go through the garage.

However Megli told The Desert Sun that her and Nichole were talking about something else.

Megli owns the Yucco Valley home that the police searched.

Lee, his wife and their daughter stayed at the home as they prepared to relocate to Alaska.

They are believed to have moved last week.

The affidavit says a rifle belonging to Lee was retrieved by police from a closet in the back of Megli's residence.

Megli said she had no knowledge of the rifle.

She added that she never suspected Corwin and Lee of having an affair.

The court documents also say police found a single 
set of shoe tracks at Corwin's abandoned vehicle at the marine base.

The tracks led from 
the driver side door of her Toyota and then disappeared next to a set of
 tire tracks.

The court document states that tracks found at the scene were 'consistent' with the tire tracks left by Lee's Jeep.

Sweethearts: The married couple moved in 
together for the first time only a few months ago after the husband 
returned for serving overses. They have been together since they were teenagers (pictures)

Sheriff's spokeswoman Jodi Miller said Lee was arrested as a result of a search warrant in an ongoing investigation, but would not give more details, nor say any more about the destructive device Lee is suspected of possessing.

It was not immediately clear whether Lee had hired an attorney, and current contact information in his name could not be found.

He was in the Marines for seven years, last serving as a rifleman in the Individual Ready Reserve.

A number of people have been interviewed in Corwin's case, Miller said, but no person of interest or suspect has been named.

Several law enforcement agencies and hundreds of volunteers searched a broad swath of desert for Corwin, but there have been no reported sightings.

The search was significantly scaled back last week, but it continues, officials said.

Corwin is still classified as a missing person.

Police do not believe she ran away.

Both Erin and Jonathan Corwin are from Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

They have been together since they were teenagers.
