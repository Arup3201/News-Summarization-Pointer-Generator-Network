The founder of the organization that built Colorado's largest mosque is offering to bury suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a Denver-area Muslim cemetery.

Sheikh Abu-Omar Al-mubarac said he will pay for a traditional Muslim burial - no headstone, monument or casket - at a plot at a Muslim cemetery in Denver or Bennett.

Al-mubarac refused to say which one out of concern for 'undue publicity.' He says he'll bury Tsarnaev as long as his family can get the body to Denver.

Offer: Sheikh Abu-Omar Almubarac who founded the Colorado Muslim Society and the states largest mosque has offered to bury the body of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev

Al-mubarac incorporated the Colorado Muslim Society in the late 1960s but made his offer independently of the organization. Al-mubarac says only God can judge Tsarnaev.

However, the Colorado Muslim Society issued a statement on Monday night distancing itself from its founder, Al-mubarac.

'It has recently been reported that the Colorado Muslim Society has offered to provide burial services for Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the individuals who perpetrated the grave and destructive bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon.

This report is absolutely untrue. The individual who has reportedly made this offer does not speak on behalf of the Colorado Muslim Society,' the statement says.

It continues, 'The Colorado Muslim Society strongly condemns all acts of violence and grieves with all of America after the attacks in Boston.

The conduct of Tamerlan Tsarnaev is abhorrent and contrary to every principle and belief that underlies the purpose of the Colorado Muslim Society.'

The Colorado Muslim Society's general counsel Qusair Mohamedbhai told The Denver Post 'we would never, ever do something like that — offer to bury someone who has committed an extreme act of violence against this country.'

Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Montgomery Village, Maryland, has 
been unable to bury his nephew in Massachusetts because of protests.

The funeral director who currently has the 
body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in his possession has made a plea to the State Department to 
help him settle what will happen with the remains.

The city of Cambridge, where the 
suspected bombers lived prior to the attack, refused to bury the body.

Mr
Stefan, whose business in Worcester, Massachusetts has been picketed by
protesters, said that everyone deserves a dignified burial.

Decision time: Peter Stefan told a news conference on Monday that a decision had to be reached after the city of Cambridge refused to bury the body of suspected bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev there

The impasse over 26-year-old Tsarnaev's body came as a local man started a fundraising campaign to have the alleged terrorist's body returned to his family in Russia. 

William Breault, from Worcester, has kick-started the campaign with $500 to send the body back to Tsarnaev's parents.

Mr Stefan said on Monday that he understood the reluctance to deal with the remains following the atrocious attacks last month.

However he told NBC: 'Everyone wants him sent back to Russia. I'm gonna get on the phone with the necessary people and say, ''We need help with this.'''

The funeral director added: 'It also makes us look bad. In this country, we bury people. We don't leave them hanging around.'

Mr Stefan said that he believed that alleged terrorist's family want his body returned to Russia. Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva has repeatedly claimed that her son's were framed for the Boston bombing.

A State Department spokesman said that Tsarnaev's family should contact the Russian Consulate for help while Massachusetts Governor Patrick Deval called the burial a 'family issue'.

Family: Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni arrived at Mr Stefan's funeral home on Sunday where Tsarnaev awaits burial rites

Determined: Funeral director Peter Stefan accepted the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, to give him a 'dignified burial'

Cambridge city manager Robert Healy said on Sunday that Tsarnaev's body was not welcomed in one of its cemeteries.

'I
have determined that it is not in the best interest of peace within the
city to execute a cemetery deed for a plot within the Cambridge 
Cemetery for the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev,' Healey said.

Tsarnaev's uncle  Ruslan Tsarni visited the funeral home over the weekend to claim his nephew's body.

Tsarni chose to step in, he said, 
because 'no one wants to associate their names with such evil events' 
and because religion and tradition call for his nephew to be buried.

Every cemetery in Massachusetts has turned down the body of Tsarnaev but Mr Stefan remains insistent that this death be handled like any other.

He has also reached out unsuccessfully to cemeteries in New Jersey and Connecticut.

Some protesters outside the funeral home believe the bombing suspect should be buried at sea, similar to what was done with the body of Osama bin Laden.

Other protestors simply did not want Tsarnaev's remains in their town, like retired firefighter Ronald Wahlers.

'It’s going to give this neighborhood a bad name,' Wahlers, who has lived in Worcester for a year and a half, told the Boston Globe. 'This guy doesn’t belong here.'

Tsarnaev, 26, died from ‘gunshot 
wounds of torso and extremities’ and blunt trauma to his head and torso. The certificate lists the time of his death as 1.35am on April 19, four days after the deadly bombing.

Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with authorities who had launched a massive manhunt for him and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the U.S. ten years ago. Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing.

Tsarnaev's family was making arrangements Friday for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured the day after his brother's death.

Body: Tsarvaev's body is now at Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, waiting to be buried

The body was released by the state medical examiner on Thursday.

It initially was taken to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters, before being taken to Mr Stefan's funeral parlor, which is familiar with Muslim services.

Meanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth.

Boston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to national TV.

Authorities plan to look at security procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the New Year's Eve celebration held each year in New York City's Times Square, Massachusetts state police spokesman David Procopio said.

Governor Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event.

As part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities have been searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student.

Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found 
hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a backyard in Watertown, a Boston 
suburb, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill.

Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of 
helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his 
dormitory room before the FBI searched it.

The
April 15 bombing, which used pressure cookers packed with explosives, 
nails, ball bearings and metal shards, killed three people and injured 
more than 260 others near the marathon's finish line.

Angry: Dozens of protestors have begun picketing Stefan's business, like Scott Schaeffer-Duffy, pictured, who crossed the Boston marathon finish line minutes before the bombs detonated

The brothers decided to carry out the attack before Independence Day when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation.

Investigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said.

The brothers' mother insists the allegations against them are lies.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained on Friday.

The new procedure is the government's first security change directly related to the Boston bombings.

The order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated on Thursday and came one day after the Obama administration acknowledged that one of the students accused of hiding evidence, Azamat Tazhayakov, of Kazakhstan, was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a valid student visa.

Tazhayakov's lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the bombing and was shocked by it
