University of Notre Dame denied official recognition to a student club that supports traditional marriage.

Students for Child-Oriented Policy (SCOP) was denied on April 30 by the school's Club Coordination Council (CCC) because its mission 'closely mirrored' other clubs' aims, Fox News reports.

The club's Facebook page says it is focused on marriage policy in Indiana and how that may affect children's well-being.

'SCOP's overarching concern is that policymakers are failing to approach their task with a view to how those policies will affect children,' its page says. 'They seem to conceive of policy only as it will affect the stable, independent adult with resources.'

This 
spring, SCOP created a petition asking for Notre Dame 'to make a clear 
stand in support of the true definition of marriage and to take serious 
and sustained action to improve the public understanding of this natural
 institution.'

Protesting the club's aims, students formed another group, called Students Against SCOP, and started a petition of their own asking for it to not be officially recognized.

The denial is 'not unusual,' Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Brown told the National Catholic Register. He said 31% of clubs were denied recognition in the last five years mainly because they had the same purpose as already-existing clubs. SCOP was one of six clubs denied this spring, he said.

CCC President Jimmy McEntee told the Register that 
SCOP's goals are not unlike those of Children's Defense Fund and Orestes Brownson Council.

However,
 the paper points out that Children's Defense Fund website was last 
updated in 2005.

McEntee declined to comment to MailOnline but said that he stood by the council's decision.

Law professor Gerard Bradley, who is the club's prospective faculty advisor, said in a statement 'there is no substantial overlap or redundancy' between SCOP and the other two clubs.

Bradley said this misunderstanding may be due to 'utter ignorance' about the club's purpose or possibly 'sheer hostility against what SCOP stands for.'

'Either way - ignorance or hostility - this decision reflects very badly on the University of Notre Dame,' Bradley said. He said he expects University President Father John Jenkins to reverse the decision.

Requests for comment to the university were not immediately returned.
