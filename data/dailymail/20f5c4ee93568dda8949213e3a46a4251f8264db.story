For most people scrap wood means little more than an improvised door stop or a replacement paper weight, if not just rubbish for the bin.

But not for artist James McNabb, who sees a miniature home, office or skyscraper in every wooden off cut that falls onto his studio floor.

The Philadelphia-based sculptor has carved thousands of pieces of scrap wood and carefully placed them together to form a vast city skyline.

The wooden skyscrapers, made in different shapes and sizes, look remarkably like the Manhattan skyline in New York City.

Skyline of sight: Growing up in Montville, New Jersey, McNabb says he would stare at the city skyline from hilltops as a child

'You could see the New York City skyline from the hilltops

The collection, totalling a staggering five thousand individual buildings also includes a huge ‘city wheel’ - which is almost five feet high.

And the artist explained how the idea came about.

The 28-year-old said: 'I grabbed a piece of scrap wood from the bin, and without thinking, made some cuts.

'In a few minutes the piece started to look strangely familiar, like a screwdriver or a mini skyscraper.

'I grabbed another piece of scrap wood, and made another object - this time, it looked like wrench, or a table leg.

'In the next hour I made 15 more - I stayed up that night and worked until morning.

'In 24 hours I made more than 200, all intricately different from the next.

Scrapping the rules: McNabb says his habit of using scrap wood is 'my reference to the idea that in order to be successful in the city, we must be willing and able to make something out of nothing'

Connections: The artist, who has 10 years of woodworking experience, was able to create this collection as he gets his own supply from his father, the owner of a wood mill

'When I stood them next to each other, I discovered I was making a small city of objects that were all distinctly different and unique.'

And the artist, who owns his design studio in Philadelphia, said his fascination with skylines started when he was a child.

He added: 'I’ve loved city skylines ever since I was a child, growing up in Montville, New Jersey.

'You could see the New York City skyline from the hilltops - I always liked to stare at it.

'Growing up, I experienced an outsider’s perspective, always viewing the city from the distance. But from that viewpoint, its very captivating.

'I’ve always been inspired by New York City, but mostly for the culture, the fast-paced environment, and the notion that it’s the place people go in search of freedom, fortune and fame.'

The artist says: 'To date, I¿ve made roughly 5,000 skyscrapers. I have been cutting a handful or two every day lately - the total number is still growing'

And the artist, who has 10 years worth of woodworking experience, was able to create this collection as he gets his own supply from his father.

He continued: 'My dad has a small wood mill in New Jersey - he has provided me with most of the wood I use to make furniture.

'I usually gather a bunch of scrap wood and put a pile next to the band saw.

'I put my headphones in, listen to my favourite music, and start cutting - I have worked through the night on several occasions.

'To date, I’ve made roughly 5,000 skyscrapers. I have been cutting a handful or two every day lately - the total number is still growing.

'My habit of using scrap wood to make this work is my reference to the idea that in order to be successful in the city, we must be willing and able to make something out of nothing.'
