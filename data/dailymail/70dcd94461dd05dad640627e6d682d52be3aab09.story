Comedienne and author Sarah Silverman has fronted a new National Women's Law Center campaign to raise awareness concerning the U.S. gender wage gap, in which she attends a staged sex change consultation.

'Every year the average woman loses around $11,000 to the wage gap,' Miss Silverman, 43, explains from a doctor's office, flinging around a selection of prosthetic penises.

'Over the course of her working life, that's almost $500,000. That's a $500,000 vagina tax... that's why I'm becoming a dude.'

Time for a sex change: Sarah Silverman has fronted a new campaign to raise awareness concerning the gender wage gap (pictured) and claims almost $30 trillion is owed to U.S. working women

As the video unfolds, titled Sarah Silverman Closes Her Gap, Miss Silverman peruses a wide selection of hilariously realistic prosthetic penises in a bid to become a man, and thus enjoy better pay standards. 

'In the grand scheme of things, it's way less expensive than the money I'll lose having a p***y,' she reasons, admiring penises dubbed 'The Gentleman,' 'The Frat Boy,' and 'The Seinfeld.'

Casey Rand, creative director of Droga5, which masterminded the campaign, told Adweek: 'Equal pay may not be a sexy issue, but it's an important one.

'And it is absurd. Young women need to know what's at stake. And we knew that to get them to engage, we'd need to play up that absurdity.'

'Oh my god I've got boots that would look amazing with this. I'll take it!' Miss Silverman exclaims upon being matched with her ideal penis.

'Can you give me two really big balls? I feel like I'm gonna be a ball guy. Or make it three. It's gonna take a lot of balls to tell women that the wage gap is fair.'

And she has a point. According to the campaign, dubbed the Equal Payback Project, women make up almost half the working population, yet typically earn just .76c - or .69c if they are mothers - for every dollar a man makes, in almost every profession.

As the campaign points out, these figures mean that society owes working women nearly $30 trillion.

The National Women's Law Center argues that this issue isn't been talked about enough. Indeed, around 60per cent of private sector workers are discouraged or actively prohibited from talking about wages at work.

'The wage gap is stubborn, it's persistent and it's outrageous,' says the organization's co-president Marcia D. Greenberger.

'We're thrilled that Sarah Silverman is bringing her prodigious talents and brand of irreverent humor to bear on a very serious issue for women and their families.

'We hope she opens hearts and minds - and a few pocketbooks - to provide the resources to close the wage gap once and for all.'

The campaign is calling for donations to reach $30 trillion - the collective dollar total lost to the 69 million-strong female workforce over the course of their careers because of the gender pay gap.

Of course, this goal is nigh impossible, and set more to make a point. If it is reached, every working woman in the U.S. will receive a check for $435,049 - the total amount she will lose to the gender pay gap.

If not, all funds will go to the National Women's Law Center, where it will be used to push new legislation, promote flexible work hours, and keep employers accountable for existing legislation.

'They're very good at what they do,' Miss Silverman assures us. 'You know, for a bunch of girls.'

Miss Silverman has been fighting for a wide range of social causes for much of her career.

A vegan since she was ten years old, the comedienne and author of The Bedwetter, is currently in a relationship with Welsh actor Michael Scheen, but has stated that she won't get married until same-same couples are legally permitted to do so.

Her satirical comedy addresses a wealth of social taboos and controversial topics such as racism, sexism, and religion; and her latest screen appearance was over the weekend when she hosted Saturday Night Live.

Miss Silverman isn't the only star giving air time to the issue of gender inequality.

Last month, Harry Potter actress Emma Watson made a much-lauded speech at the United Nations Headquarters in which she spoke passionately about feminism and women's rights.

Miss Watson thus launched the HeForShe campaign, which strives for equal rights for men and women, including the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.'
