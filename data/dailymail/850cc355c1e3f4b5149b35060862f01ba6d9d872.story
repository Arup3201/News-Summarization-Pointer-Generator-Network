HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

Barclays Premier League penalty boxes are starting to look more like WWE wrestling rings as defenders blatantly cheat to stop attackers scoring goals from set pieces.

Sunday's clash of the titans at Old Trafford produced the most outrageous example yet seen. Marcos Rojo took John Terry in a headlock while Chris Smalling did the same to Branislav Ivanovic before dragging him to the ground. Both Manchester United defenders went unpunished.

But this is by no means an isolated incident and Sportsmail has launched a new campaign  to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area.

Referees and assistants need to toughen up - they can see these fouls but choose not to punish them because they do not want to give away multiple penalties per match.

But that is not good enough. Bodychecking and wrestling inside the box must be stamped out, just as tackles from behind have been and reckless challenges are being now.

Guilty defenders must be named and shamed - if everyone knows who the cheats are, referees will have no excuse not to punish serial offenders.

So, here is a rogues gallery nominated by Sportsmail's experts. The players below are those who we consider the worst offenders in the game. But unfortunately they are still just the tip of the iceberg.

Nominate YOUR prime suspects by using the comments section below...

But that was not the only incident at the same set piece, with John Terry and Marcos Rojo also grappling (right)

RYAN SHAWCROSS (Stoke City)

No player has conceded more penalties in the Premier League in the past five years. As good and decent as he is, the Stoke defender is one of the worst offenders. He’s being targeted by officials now and was correctly punished when he held Swansea striker Wilfried Bony at a corner.

MARTIN SKRTEL (Liverpool)

I would say the Liverpool defender has turned this in to an art form if he wasn’t so bad at it.

Ian Ladyman

Liverpool's Martin Skrtel has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking

VINCENT KOMPANY (Manchester City)

Arguably the finest defender in the Premier League after John Terry, Kompany is a brute. He operates on the edge – just ask Fernando Torres, who the Belgian ‘monstered’ in the 2013 FA Cup semi-final (below). Watch him as City defend their next corner, he’ll be all over his man.

MARTIN SKRTEL (Liverpool)

I wouldn't say he is the worst in the Premier League but it does not go unnoticed how often Liverpool's Slovakian central defender grapples with opponents at set pieces. There's nothing wrong with being combative but one of these days Skrtel may find himself being penalised.

Dominic King

MARTIN SKRTEL (Liverpool)

Always felt he and Daniel Agger got away with a lot at Liverpool. With Agger gone, Skrtel is the standard bearer.

JOHN TERRY (Chelsea)

The Chelsea captain will do just about anything to clear his lines and make it hard for the opposition and this often means resorting to the dark arts. But you don’t become the Premier League’s best defender without working out how to get away with it.

MILE JEDINAK (Crystal Palace)

Mike Dean rightly awarded a spot-kick when the Palace captain rugby-tackled Burnley’s Lukas Jutkiewicz to the floor last month. Julian Speroni spared his blushes with a fine penalty save that day but Jedinak is a serial offender.

Joe Ridge

MAROUANE FELLAINI (Manchester United)

Cynical defending was about the only thing Fellaini contributed to United's cause during his first year at Old Trafford. Let's have more spectacular goals like the strike at West Brom last week rather than all that ugly shirt-pulling, please.

Chris Cutmore

MARTIN SKRTEL (Liverpool)

He is all about the physical side of the game but takes it too far defending corners and free kicks. Skrtel barely ever looks at the ball and rarely does he not have a chunk of his opponent's shirt in his hand. He's been doing it week-in-week-out since he joined the Premier League in 2008.

Sam Cunningham

STEVEN TAYLOR (Newcastle)

The physical defender gives as good as he gets in the box, and then some. Taylor loves blocking in the area in every sense of the word, including Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic's eyeline in 2013.

Kieran Gill 

WES MORGAN (Leicester City)

Not the quickest over five yards, Morgan gains an advantage when defending corners by blocking off from set pieces. More of a wrestler than shirt-puller, the Leicester captain consistently gets away with impeding strikers unfairly, often grasping an opponent’s upper arm to haul them back.

Jack Gaughan

Branislav Ivanovic (Chelsea)

The defender got a taste of his own medicine at the weekend. Ivanovic may be playing the victim right now but he’s mastered the dark arts of defending. Just look at the picture below.

Rajvir Rai

Mertesacker (yes, him again) has his shorts tugged by Ivanovic during a corner at Stamford Bridge in October - and fellow Chelsea defender Gary Cahill (left) grabs hold of the German's torso for good measure

JOHN TERRY (Chelsea)

One of the main offenders for the last decade or so, John Terry loves a tug on an opponent's shirt. Grappling for space in the area ready to 'defend' a set-piece, the Chelsea centre back has long evaded punishment for being heavy-handed in the penalty box.

Elliott Bretland

MAROUANE CHAMAKH (Crystal Palace)

When the Moroccan arrived at Arsenal he was notable as much for his ‘defending’ at corners as his (limited) goal-threat. Since working under Tony Pulis and now Neil Warnock at Palace, his proficiency at the dark arts has only increased. Rarely seen at a set piece without a handful of shirt.

John Terry, Chelsea captain

‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’

Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager

‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ 

Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker

‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’

Graham Poll, Former top referee

‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’

Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender

‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’

Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager

‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’

And the readers of MailOnline...

‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath

‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester
