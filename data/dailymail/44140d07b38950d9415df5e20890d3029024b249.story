Accused: Msgr Kevin Wallin was allegedly suspended by the Church for having sex in his rectory. He has also been charged by police with distributing crystal meth in a cross-country ring

A Connecticut priest at the centre of a meth drug-dealing gang has been suspended over allegations he had sex in his rectory.

Monsignor Kevin Wallin was relieved of his duties in May last year after complaints were made by staff at his residence in Bridgeport.

The news will embarrass the Church as the priest also faces charges of helping run a cross-country methamphetamine 
distribution ring.

Msgr Wallin allegedly received 
the drug  shipments from suppliers in California and then sold them to 
undercover officers at least six different times between last September 
and the beginning of this month.

According to his indictment he was selling around $9,000 of meth a week at one stage.

Msgr Wallin, 61, is alleged to have bought an 'adult entertainment store' which investigators believe helped him launder thousands of dollars in weekly profits, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

Rectory staff are believed to have notified the local diocese after the priest allegedly 'dressed as a woman and engaged in 'sex acts.'

Diocese officials are understood to have consulted lawyers who said that none of Wallin's behavior appeared to be illegal.

The priest had resigned from his role as pastor of St. Augustine's in Bridgeport in June 2011, citing health concerns and personal problems.

Msgr Wallin, who previously served as secretary to bishops Walter Curtis and Edward Egan in Bridgeport, was arrested and charged with six counts of possession with intent to distribute crystal meth, NBC Connecticut reported. He has been detained until an arraignment hearing next week.

Church officials said they were not aware that the priest was selling drugs when he was pastor of St. Augustine's Cathedral or in St. Peter Parish, according to the Chronicle.

Trusted: Msgr Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons

He is believed to have continued to 
receive his stipend - salary - from the Church, until he was arrested on
the drugs charges on January 3 this year.

Msgr Wallin left his post as head of St. Augustine's after nine years and was granted a 'sabbatical' by church authorities.

'During his sabbatical, the Diocese became concerned about his well-being and have continued to reach out to him,' the Diocese
wrote in a statement.

'To date, he has not spoken directly with 
diocesan officials.

'News of [his] arrest comes with a sense of shock and 
concern on the part of the Diocese and the many people of Fairfield 
County who have known him as a gifted, accomplished and compassionate 
priest.'

Ring: The priest and four others were arrested for allegedly conspiring to distribute crystal meth

Four others were also charged with 
conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine  along with Msgr Wallin in the joint
investigation by the federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the Connecticut State Police's Statewide Narcotics 
Task Force.

They were identified as Kenneth Devries, 52,; Michael Neslon, 40,; 
Chad McCluskey, 43,; and Kristen Laschober, 
47.

'The hard work of the DEA and the Connecticut State Police in this case 
resulted in the dismantling of what we allege was a significant 
methamphetamine distribution organization that spanned from California 
to Connecticut,' said U.S. Attorney David Fein, according to the Connecticut Post.

Msgr Wallin faces up to 20 years behind bars and a $2 million fine if convicted.
