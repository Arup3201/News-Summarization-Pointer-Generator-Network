On the mend: Isabel Manchip has restricted use of the left side of her body but is learning to walk

A girl who suffered a stroke at just one year old is managing to defy medical predictions by learning to walk and talk.

Isabel Manchip from Portsmouth is one of the youngest children in Britain to suffer a stroke, which damaged  75 per cent of the right side of her brain.

Isabel, now two, still has little use of the left side of her body and wears a splint every day to support her left arm.

Unlike adults, for whom the greatest stroke risks are known to be smoking, poor diet and high cholesterol, the causes of childhood strokes are less clear-cut.

Her parents Rebecca, 45, and Eddie, 48, believe Isabel's was brought on by chickenpox.

Eddie, an IT consultant said: 'Isabel had a high temperature for eight days solid.

'Doctors thought it was an infection which caused it, but the likelihood is that she had chicken pox because our son Matthew came down with it shortly afterwards.

'Instead of having a bleed on the brain which can sometimes happen in a stroke, her brain was starved of oxygen.

Isabel had the stroke on December 28 2011 and was in intensive care for five days.

Doctors told her parents to be prepared for the worst: 'We were told not to expect her to survive and the first 48-hours were critical.

'They got her in intensive care soon enough to try and preserve as much of her as possible.

'Me and Rebecca were told 95 per cent of the right side of her brain was damaged and her chance of survival was pretty slim.

Brave: Despite Isabel's ordeal, she and her parents Rebecca and Eddie are determined that she should live as normal a life as possible

'It was a horrible time - we didn't expect her to survive.'

When Isabel came round she only recognised her mother Rebecca, causing more heartbreak for the family.

Eddie said: 'She didn't recognise me, so Rebecca spent the first week at the hospital comforting her.

'It was extremely hard for me because 
Isabel was a daddy's girl beforehand, and she is again now she is 
recovered, but she just stared blankly at me.

Critical: Isabel in the intensive care unit at Southampton General Hospital in December 2011, two days after her stroke

Memory loss: When Isabel came round she could only recognise her mother, much to her family's heartache

'I kept going into see her at hospital and eventually she came round to remembering me again.'

Three months later Isabel had another MRI scan which showed the damage had reduced to 75 per cent as the bruising and swelling had gone down.

One year on she has now defied doctors' expectations not only to live, but to see, walk, run and cycle. Her father said: 'She's happy, cheeky and full of life.

Fighting for her life: Isabel's parents were told 95 per cent of the right side of her brain was damaged and her chance of survival was slim

'The right hand side of the brain which 
affects understanding has been tested and her intelligence and she is 
beyond where she should be for her age.'

Injury to the left side of the brain, known as hemiplegia, will cause paralysis on the right side of the body and injury to the right side of the brain, like Isabel's, affects the left.

Determined: She still has little use of the left side but she has persevered with her movement and speech

Eddie explained the extent of her injuries: 'She was completely blind in her left eye but she can now see across the room and walk, run, cycle.

'Although we are still trying to get her to use her left hand, arm and foot more, I think the main part of the recovery has been done.

'Her recovery has been way beyond anyone expected.

'We are so grateful she is almost back to normal - she's our little miracle.'

Rebecca, a book keeper, said: 'Isabel has come so far and we are thankful she is still with us.

'She is a determined little girl who likes learning off her six-year old brother Matthew by copying what he does.

'There isn't much more we can do for her now but her recovery has been amazing.'

Although strokes are normally associated with older people, research shows that around 350 children and babies have a stroke each year in the UK.

Stroke side effects for children can include epilepsy, visual impairment or speech difficulties.

Some children also develop specific learning difficulties or emotional and behavioural problems.
