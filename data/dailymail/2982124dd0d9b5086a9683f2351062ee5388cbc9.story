Paul Scholes has slammed England's World Cup campaign and fears the nation are on a continuous downward spiral.

Roy Hodgson's men picked up only one point during their three group games in Brazil, arriving back in England on Wednesday.

FA chairman Greg Dyke believes changes to the Premier League system, allowing more homegrown players to make the step up to first-team football, could help England win the World Cup in 2022.

But Scholes said: 'From what I've seen at this World Cup, we'll be lucky to qualify. I fear England are going the way of the Republic of Ireland, Wales and Scotland.

'England can take some positives. Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Ross Barkley, even though he didn't start the first two games, are a sign of the future - fast, intelligent footballers. But otherwise I'm struggling.'

Scholes believes the influx of foreign talent is at the root of the national team's growing problems.

'Compared to La Liga and the Bundesliga, English players are not getting enough first-team time in the Premier League,' said the Manchester United legend in his Paddy Power column.

'We're going backwards from 1990 and the era of Paul Gascoigne and that conveyor belt of talent. Simply, the Premier League is riddled with average foreign players.

'This is having a detrimental effect on the opportunities for young English talent and our international results.

'Players as talented as David Silva, Robin van Persie, Sergio Aguero and Eden Hazard only make the Premier League stronger. But it seems the Premier League is known as a market for average players (or their agents) to say: "I'll go to England and they'll pay me stupid money to play".'

Scholes, meanwhile, has questioned United's willingness to pay a high price for Southampton's Luke Shaw.

Scholes says: 'The proposed £34m transfer for Luke Shaw to United is another example of something which has a bad long-term impact. Clubs are priced out of this market which is why they go abroad for cheap options. For a left back to be worth £34m shows how silly the game has gone.'
