He might be a freshly minted 93 but the Duke of Edinburgh is showing no signs of slowing down after flying to Fallingbostel in Germany to meet soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Once at St Barbara's Barracks, he presented servicemen from The Highlanders, 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, also known as 4 Scots with their Afghanistan campaign medals.

Speaking on the parade ground, the Duke, who is the unit’s royal colonel, told more than 400 men and their officers gathered in front of him:

'I am delighted to have been asked to present these campaign medals on this occasion, and I am only sorry that D Company is not here to receive theirs as well.

'Well, as you know, this is the conclusion of the battalion’s third deployment to Afghanistan, and I believe everyone involved can look back with satisfaction at a job very well done.

'I think we should never forget that it was at the cost of three killed and nine seriously wounded.'

He went on to say that everyone also recognised the invaluable contribution made by wives, families and friends, and that he hoped they enjoyed their leave together.

The medals presented by Philip recognised those who had served in Afghanistan for the first time.

The focal point of today’s parade was the battalion colours, which were presented to the unit in Kinloss by Philip in 2011, immediately after their return from operations in Afghanistan.

The recent tour for the main body of the battalion lasted eight-and-a-half months and there are more than 100 soldiers from D Company still in Afghanistan.

During the visit, the Duke met some of the families of the servicemen and posed for a photograph with the battalion. He also had an informal lunch in the officers’ mess and also visited the sergeants’ mess.

The Duke has been having a busy period of late, with his 93rd birthday coming hot on the heels of the State Opening of Parliament and the state visit to France.

Prince Philip, who is descended from the royal line of Denmark and also holds the titles Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich, who celebrated his birthday on Tuesday, has made a huge contribution to public life during his long years as prince-consort.

Currently patron of more than 800 charities, the Duke works closely with organisations focused on scientific and technological research, child protection, sport and conservation, and has dedicated himself to boosting British industry.

He also helped found the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, which encourages teenagers to participate in charity and community work, as well as getting them out into the countryside.

A military man, the Duke had a long and distinguished career as a naval officer, including a stint as First Lieutenant (second-in-command) on the destroyer, Wallace, and took part in the Sicily landings in July 1943.

Since giving up his naval career in 1951, the Duke has remained close to the military - including the Royal Regiment of Scotland whose campaign medals he presented today.
