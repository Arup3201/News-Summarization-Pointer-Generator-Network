An Indian woman has claimed she was kept as a slave and beaten while working as a nanny for a senior Government lawyer.

Widow Pratima Das alleges she was a victim of human trafficking who ended up being abused for four years while at the home of Shibani Rahulan – principal legal adviser at the Department of Health.

Mrs Rahulan, however, has denied exploiting the 43-year-old and has produced photos of the nanny at family gatherings and holidays which, she says, prove she was not kept under duress.

Counter claim: Homeowner Shibani Rahulan - principal legal adviser at the Department of Health - said pictures such as this of Pratima Das on a family visit to the London Eye showed she wasn't held under duress

The allegations were revealed yesterday as Miss Das’s lawyers argued at the Appeal Court that it should overturn an Employment Tribunal’s decision not to hear her original case because she was ‘out of time’.

Her counsel, Ian Wheaton, told the hearing that Miss Das – who is illiterate in both her own language and English – had been a victim  of human trafficking when she was brought to London from India  in 2004.

He said: ‘It is her case that she was treated as a slave, her passport was confiscated and she was forced to work 15 hour days.

‘She was prevented from eating with the family – reduced to sitting on the floor eating the respondent family’s leftover food.

‘She was effectively held in captivity only able to make short trips to a nursery and she was threatened with violence if she tried to speak to other people.’

Mr Wheaton added that ‘events crystallised’ in June 2008 when she and her employers were involved in a ‘violent altercation’ and she managed to escape from the family home in Harrow, north-west London.

She went to hospital for treatment and then to the police claiming she had been assaulted.

Miss Das – who now lives in Southampton – then spent many months seeking legal advice but was ‘hindered by administrative delays’.

This initially saw her file an original Employment Tribunal action 42 days late which was ruled out of time.

She was then a further 80 days late in applying to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.

The court heard Miss Das was from a ‘low caste’ family in India and had been told she would  be paid £100 a month for working which should have been  paid directly to her family abroad in Rupees.

Miss Das is currently in the process of seeking permission to stay in Britain permanently.

In 2009 a judge at an asylum hearing ruled she could not go back to her home in India because Mrs Rahulan, 40, belonged to an ‘influential and higher class family in that area’.

Miss Das claimed she could face ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’ should she return.

Judge Sharp ruled at the time that Miss Das’s treatment came within the ‘definition of trafficking’, adding: ‘Her employers were harbouring her and abusing their power and taking advantage of her vulnerability for the purpose of exploiting her as an overworked and abused employee.’

But Mrs Rahulan and her current partner Rex Waldron hit back at her claims.

In a statement for the family, Mr Waldron said: ‘Miss Das said when she was sacked ‘‘I will make you regret this for the rest of your life’’ – and she’s lived up to that threat.

‘Pratima lived as a member  of the family. We’ve got photographs of her at all of our parties and family gatherings – does she look like  she’s here under duress? As a slave? It’s ridiculous.’

Yesterday Lord Justice Mummery refused the application from Mr Wheaton to allow Miss Das’s case to go before the Employment Appeal Tribunal and advised that she might go to the civil or criminal courts with her allegations.

Last night, Miss Das’s lawyer Paul Grant, of Bernard Chill & Axtell Solicitors, said there may yet be an appeal to the Supreme Court on Human Rights grounds.
