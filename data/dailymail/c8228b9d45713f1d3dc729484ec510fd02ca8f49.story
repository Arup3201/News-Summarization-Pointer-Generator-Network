The United Kingdom gave the Obama administration intelligence in June 2014 about where in Syria the ISIS terror army was holding its American captives, but the White House dithered and missed its opportunity to rescue them, according to a shocking report published Thursday.

U.S. and British officials said the administration sat on the information for nearly a month before launching a military raid to recover American aid worker Kayla Mueller and journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. 

By the time a rescue was mounted on July 4, 2014, the hostages had been moved. 

All three are now dead. ISIS militants executed Sotloff and Foley, and ISIS claims a Jordanian airstrike killed Mueller when it hit a buiding where she was being held.

DITHERER-IN-CHIEF: President Obama, shown yesterday with Secretary of State John Kerry and outgoign Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, allegedly wasted precious time last year without acting when British and French intelligence pinpointed possible locations where ISIS was holding US hostages

The Daily Beast quoted an unnamed American official saying that Obama’s national security team refused to plan a rescue mission around information gathered by a foreign government.

'The issue was that they didn’t trust it, and they wanted to develop and mature the intelligence, because it wasn’t our own,' the American official said. 'They got the information. They just didn’t trust it. And they did sit on it, there’s no doubt about that.' 

British officials and private security contractors said that hesitation was a source of frustration since a string of videotaped ISIS executions began in August and might possibly have been prevented.

NOT SO MUCH: Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters in August that 'we've used all of our military, intelligence, diplomatic resources that we can bring to bear to try to pull a thread to find out where our hostages are

British intelligence had learned in May of last year from released ISIS captives the locations of two or three places where hostages were being held captive, according to the Daily Beast.

The UK also had surveillance images from satellites and drones, and the results of some 'electronic eavesdropping.

The information wasn't certain until early June, however. By then the British government had a 'positive identification and that information was shared with Washington,' according to a British source who spoke with the Daily Beast.

National Security Council spokesperson Bernadette Meehan insisted that 'U.S. forces conducted this (rescue) operation as soon as the president and his national-security team were confident the mission could be carried out successfully and consistent with our policies for undertaking such operations.' 

But Foley's mother Diane said the U.S. also had intelligence from the French government about the hostages' whereabouts as early as March 2014 but did nothing about it.

'That was part of our frustration,' she told the Daily Beast. 

'The State Department said they were connecting with the French and everybody at the highest levels. Very specific information was available as early as mid-March.'

'And that’s what’s been so tough for us as families, because apparently they were held in the same place all those months,' Foley said.

Obama himself has pushed back against the idea that he acted too slow.

'I don’t think it’s accurate then to say that the United States government hasn’t done everything that we could,' he told the Buzzfeed website on Tuesday.

'We devoted enormous resources, and always devote enormous resources, to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world, and I deployed an entire operation at significant risk to rescue not only (Mueller), but the other individuals that had been held, and probably missed them by a day or two – precisely because we had that commitment.' 

The Washington Post reported in August 2014 that Obama had green-lighted that failed raid.

'We had a combination of ... intelligence that was sufficient to enable us to act on it,' an administration official said then.

The Pentagon moved 'very aggressively, very quickly to try and recover our citizens,' according to that source.

During Obama's Martha's Vineyard vacation in August, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that 'we've used all of our military, intelligence, diplomatic resources that we can bring to bear to try to pull a thread to find out where our hostages are; to try to rescue them when we saw an opportunity; to try to work with any country that might have any means of locating them.'
