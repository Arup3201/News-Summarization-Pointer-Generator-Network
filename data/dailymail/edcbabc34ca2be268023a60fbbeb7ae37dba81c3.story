A punter is £55,000 worse off after losing a massive single £30,000 bet on his beloved Wales to beat Australia at rugby.

Steve Richards thought his luck was in when he won £38,970 on a £10 football accumulator at odds of 3,896/1, correctly predicting the results of 12 games.

Less than a week later he decided to gamble £30,000 of it on Wales beating the Aussies at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday.Scroll down for video

The look of loss: Steve Richards reacts as he sees his money go down the drain following a big win

Steve, 56, a roofing contractor, stood to make £55,000 with a £25,000 return as the Welsh were odds-on favourites at 5/6.

But he watched in dismay as they went down 30-26 in a thrilling game. Despite his defeat Steve said he had no regrets - and would never back against Wales.

Speaking in the Black Diamond pub, in Edmondstown, Rhondda, where he watched the game with friends, he said: 'I thought it was Wales's time to win. I just lay in bed one night and I thought 'go for it'.

'I wouldn't change it, even if I could, I've still walked away with £9,000 so I'm a very lucky man. I would never back against Wales. If I thought that they were going to lose I just would not place a bet.'

He added: 'I thought it was a fair game, it's just the same old scenario - losing to a southern hemisphere side.

'I thought Australia might have been 
tired, New Zealand certainly looked it last week, so that's why I 
decided to put the bet on.'

All smiles: Mr Richards managed to be happy, however, because he is still £10,000 better-off from an accumulator

Steve, from Tonyrefail, Wales, who remained calm throughout the game and vowed to carry on betting, in the hope that his day will come.

He said: 'I bet every week - it's something to look forward to in life. I won't ever stop betting.

'I bet on the football and sometimes the horses and the dogs.'

He said he would be a little more rational with the spending of the £9,000 he kept behind.

He added: 'I won't be taking a holiday because we've got a dog and we can't leave it behind.

'I'll probably put the money in the bank and just leave it there for a bit - there isn't much I need it for at the moment.

'When it gets to April I'll probably do a few things to the garden.'

Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said: 'It was a nail biting finish and we're breathing a huge sigh of relief.

'Steve is still nearly £9,000 ahead of us so we can't be too smug though!'
