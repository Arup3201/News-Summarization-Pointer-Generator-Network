Chris Christie is the likely victor in today's gubernatorial election as he is leading his Democratic rival by 20 points and is expected to hold on to his job for another four years.

That said, Christie was clear during the campaign that if he decides to run for an even bigger title- as he has been loudly considered a possible presidential nominee- he will have no problem leaving office before his second term as governor comes to a close.

That admission would hurt many candidates, but not Christie as voting booths opened in New Jersey on Tuesday with him beating his Democratic rival Barbara Buono by a wide margin.

Taking it all in: Mary Pat Christie laughs at the jokes that her husband Chris made to reporters after voting in Mendham, New Jersey on Tuesday

Happy day: Chris Christie is expected to win a second term as New Jersey governor when the state votes in their gubernatorial election today and he is leading by 20 points in the latest polls

Keep smiling: Barbara Buono went up against Christie after working as a state senator and she used her campaign to paint him as an ambitious conservative out for only himself

Mrs Buono was the first of the two to cast her vote, wearing a blue skirt suit and waving to fans at the Metuchen polling station.

Christie commented for the first time about the fact that a member of Mitt Romney's campaign staff leaked the New Jersey governor's private vetting file to two reporters writing a book about the 2012 campaign.

In the files, several potentially embarrassing disclosures were made about Christie's past including lawsuits and favoritism when it comes to awarding state contracts.

'When it came to light a few months ago that it had leaked, Mitt called me right away, and I could tell he was really embarrassed and outraged about it and I think thats the kind of reaction that the person in charge should have,' Christie said in an interview with CNN on Election Day.

The authors of the book in question, Double Down, have not revealed their source but it had to be someone within Romney's inner circle.

Christie brushed off the issue, but said that it was clearly a reflection of someone's feelings against him and not the handful of other Republicans vetted by Romney's team who had similar files.

'There's nothing in there that I have a huge problem with and it seems it only happened to me,' he said.

Christie spent much of the past week traveling across the state in an effort to ensure voter turnout, and if his supporters cast their vote, he may become the first Republican governor to win a state-wide office by more than 50 per cent since former President George H.W. Bush did so in 1988.

Christie was last seen on Monday, making the rounds at a series of campaign stops including one photo opp at a bakery in Hillside.

The Republican's weight has been an issue of public debate ever since he was considered as a possible Vice Presidential candidate for Mitt Romney last year.

'I feel really good,' Christie told CNN's Jake Tapper on Election Day.

'We're a little more than halfway to my goal in the last 8 months and I sleep better and the biggest difference to me is that I didn't feel badly at my previous weight but I didn't realize how badly I slept which is bad for my staff because I have more energy than I did before which I didn't think was possible.'

He has repeatedly brushed off the 
concerns about his health by saying it is a personal issue but he also 
announced in May that he had undergone lap-band surgery two months prior
 to help combat his obesity.

As
 part of his campaign, Christie allowed his doctor to give a report on 
his health status saying that the 51-year-old has been 'losing weight 
steadily' since the February operation.Â 

'Governor
 Christie has normal blood work, normal cardiovascular test results, and
 good functional capacity,' said Dr Rachana Kulkarni.

Get in there: Governor Chris Christie shakes the hand of a worker at the Oasis Pastry Shop in Hillside, New Jersey during a campaign stop on Monday, just hours before polls open in his re-election bid

Steering clear: The Republican governor's weight has been a concern for some political operatives and may have been a contributing factor for why he was passed over in the choice of Mitt Romney's vice presidential selection

Being good: Since having lap-band surgery in February, Christie's doctor said that he is half way towards his weight goal but would not disclose what that number was

The doctor would not give a specific figure to CBS News during an interview last week, but did say that Christie is 'more than halfway' to his goal weight.

While his weight has largely been an issue for critics, but a new book that gives a backstage look at the 2012 election reveals that it is something that his allies thought about as well.

Christie was listed as part of Mitt 
Romney's short list for vice presidential candidates, and the campaign 
tell-all 'Double Down', as reported by Time, shows that the candidate's team used fish-themed nicknames for each of the secret subjects.

As such, Christie was given the moniker 'pufferfish'.

Facing off: The latest poll has Christie beating his Democratic opponent Barbara Buono by 20 points

Many directions: Even if he is re-elected on Tuesday, he has said that he would consider running for President in 2016 which would force him to leave the governorship before his term ends

The latest poll conducted by Monmouth University reported by PolitickerNJ, has Christie beating his Democratic opponent Barbara Buono by 20 points, with him winning the race 57 per cent to 37 per cent.

The presumed victory comes as little surprise as Christie is popular on both sides of the aisle and received some record-breaking approval numbers following his handling of Hurricane Sandy.

His campaign staff were not the only ones who expected a victory, as the Democratic Governor's Association only spent $5,000 to support his competitor.
