A painstaking conservation effort to 
remove old patches and repair weak spots in a 714-year-old copy of the 
Magna Carta has revealed that the full text of that English declaration 
of human rights remains intact even though some words are faded and 
illegible to the eye, the National Archives said today.

A $13.5million gift from philanthropist 
David Rubenstein - owner of the handwritten document - is funding the 
conservation effort as well preparations for an upcoming exhibit.

Thanks to the gift, the largest cash 
donation to the National Archives, the copy of the Magna Carta 
eventually will be shown as a forerunner to the freedoms imagined in the
U.S. Declaration of Independence, Constitution and Bill of Rights.

Rare: David Rubenstein poses with a 1297 Magna Carta document, at the National Archives in Washington in March, 2008

Plans call for exhibiting it along 
with documents showing the struggle for rights of African Americans, 
women, immigrants and others.

The Magna Carta bears the seal of King
Edward I and is dated 1297. It is one of 17 known handwritten copies of
the text that established a tradition for the rule of law that even the
king would honour. It is the only original version in the Americas, 
while 15 are held by British institutions and one is held by Australia's
Parliament.

Ultra-violet photography revealed the previously illegible writing and a fuller picture of the document's good condition, conservators said. Words on the right side of the text had been hidden by water damage at some point in the past.

Lead conservator Catherine Nicholson said: 'It's just sort of a wonderful, magical tool that conservators use to reveal what, just to the naked eye, would seem to be lost forever. Even though things look damaged, there's still a residue there that can be confirmed.'

Low-angled light also revealed an embossed image of the king seated on his throne as part of the document's seal.

None of the faded ink was replaced during weeks of conservation because the archive abides by a conservative treatment philosophy.

Spokesman Susan Cooper explained: 'We consider it part of the history of the document, the fading, we want to leave that there.'

During the treatment process, conservators removed old patches and adhesives and added handmade conservation paper to strengthen the weak spots. The Magna Carta was then humidified, flattened and will lie untouched for at least three months under weights to reach the proper moisture level before being placed in a new case with humidified, inert gas for long-term preservation.

Less than one per cent of the document's text was illegible because of damage, conservator Terry Boone said. The missing text was not revealed under simple UV light, but only when conservators used a special camera the archives recently purchased.

Nicholson explained the findings: 'We're looking at something written in medieval hand, and it's in Latin,' Nicholson said.

The future exhibit could include a ultra-violet image with the full text, as well as interactive elements with a translation to show visitors how it is linked to the rights of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution.

Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot first purchased the document from a British family for $1.5million in 1984 when it was last conserved at a Virginia lab. For 20 years, it was lent to the National Archives and was on public view much of that time.

Then in 2007, Rubenstein bought it for $21.3million at auction. The billionaire co-founder of The Carlyle Group, a Washington-based private equity firm, said he bought it to prevent it from being taken out of the United States. He returned it to the National Archives in 2008 on a long-term loan.

A new gallery named for Rubenstein is scheduled to open in 2012 with the Magna Carta as a centrepiece.
