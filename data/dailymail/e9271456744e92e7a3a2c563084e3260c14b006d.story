Former Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock has heaped some of the blame for his Eagles demise on the state of the pitch at Selhurst Park.

The 66-year-old, who was sacked as manager of the south London club on Sunday, endured a difficult four months, but says that he was not helped by the playing surface at Palace's home games.

'Aston Villa and Sunderland were disappointing performances [1-0 and 3-1 losses respectively]. Other than that, the pitch has been terrible at home,' Warnock told talkSPORT's Sports Breakfast. 'It's not bad for the away team, playing once, but we've kept it bad.

The ex-Palace man was quick to say that the Palace training ground at Beckenham is not up to scratch

'We've been reported by every team in the Premier League. They [the Palace players] couldn't do the kilometres they've done away from home. It was like running on sand, and that has hampered them.'

Alan Pardew, the incoming Palace boss - as revealed by Sportsmail on Monday - will not suffer the same problem, as the Selhurst Park pitch was dug up after Boxing Day, to be replaced before their next home game against Tottenham on January 10th. 

Warnock went on to explain the other shortcomings he faced in his time at Palace.

Warnock also cited the defeat to Sunderland (pictured) as another low-point of Palace's season so far

'The infrastructure at Palace is very poor, but Pardew will get time. The training ground is not in the best state. We thought we had a new one a few months ago, but that fell through. The chairman is working very hard.

'All we wanted was a striker and a left-sided defender and we've been looking for a while now.  

'When you look at the Premier League. I think they can do it, you know. I think Alan knows what he needs. I think they can finish as high as they did last year.

'Quite honestly, you've seen how we played at Spurs and we've played like that most games, We've just been punished at home.'

Warnock was sacked with the Eagles languishing in the bottom three of the Premier League. Last season, with Tony Pulis at the helm, they were propelled to 12th, but have failed to find the same form this term.

The departing manager though, is happy with the job he did at Selhurst Park.

Steve Parish made a bold move by sacking Warnock after four months, and has appointed Pardew instead

'Yes, absolutely. The Southampton game I actually just changed the tactics because of the way Southampton played. I was convinced we could go to QPR and win. I were disappointed not to go to QPR, I've never had an opportunity to say goodbye to their fans. At both clubs, I didn't get much chance to bring in players.' 

'The crowd had a right go at me (on Boxing Day). I would have had a right go at me, taking Bolasie off at 3-0 down. His wife was having a baby and we had QPR 48 hours later. There was a group that shouted, not thousands and thousands. There were no abuse at the end of the game, Palace fans have been great to me.'

And so, that is that. Warnock leaves Palace in the bottom three, but with high aspirations for the rest of the season. According to the ex-Eagles man, Pardew is the right man to move the club forward. In fact, he told him that in August.
