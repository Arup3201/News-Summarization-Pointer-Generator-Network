NBC Nightly News has issued a wonderfully fact-filled apology to the state of New Hampshire after inadvertently leaving the Granite State off the map while covering the story of a train derailment in Canada earlier this week.

'It moved to Vermont and then New York took over a bunch of territory,' said news anchor Brian Williams during the segment.

'Mea culpa and full disclosure,' he told viewers.

'New Hampshire was lost by our graphics department - it has since been found and put back.'

Williams said a few 'sharp-eyed viewers' noticed the discrepancy - as well as 'at least one U.S. senator'.

Returned: After putting New Hampshire back in its place, Brian Williams gave viewers a brief yet info-packed run-down on the state

He said the error called for a reminder of the great things about New Hampshire then reeled off some little-known facts.

For example, did you know that paper towels were invented in New Hampshire? How about that the inventor of Tupperware was from there?

Williams says the state has the best 
motto: Live Free or Die, and that its entire elected delegation is female
 - including the governor, two U.S. senators and members of congress.And
 while these politcos are 'serious people', he says the state has also 
bred amusing types such as Sarah Silverman and Seth Meyers.

Williams moves on to other stories after the revelation about paper towels, but the 59-second segment was approved by Twitter pundits who were quick to jump on the error after the 
original NBC segment was 
aired on Tuesday.
