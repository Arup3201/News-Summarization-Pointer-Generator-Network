Online retail giant Boohoo.com opens its first standalone store tomorrow, allowing fans of its fast fashion wares to shop them in real life for the first time.

But instead of a location in its native UK, the Boohoo.com shop has popped up for the next two weeks in New York City - part of a major bid to capture the U.S. market.

The two-level store, which is positioned among the designer boutiques of West Broadway, opened with a star-studded launch party last night, with guests including Jamie Chung, Femme and a live performance from Tanlines.

When shoppers are welcomed for the first time tomorrow however, they will find it stocked with highlights from the fall/winter collection.

And with trend-led pieces costing from just $20, it looks set to become a fierce competitor in the U.S. to Forever 21 and H&M. In fact, a member of the PR team told MailOnline, no item ever costs more than $100.

It is a formula that clearly works. The eight-year-old company reported revenues of £67million for the six month period to August 31.

But future standalone stores are not part of the company's gameplan, says co-founder and CEO Carol Kane.

'If I talk about our product strategy, it's of newness,' she told WWD. 'We have 500 lines delivered every single week. You can't support what we do very easily in a store environment. You can have a collection here, but it's going out of stock as quick as it's going in.' 

Rather, the pop-up shop is more of a marketing tool, not dissimilar to the strategy behind Amazon's brick-and-mortar store, which is believed to be opening in Midtown Manhattan for the holiday season.

On the prospect of a permanent Boohoo.com store, Kane replied: 'I’m asked that all the time. My business partner [Mahmud Kamani] has a great answer: "Why would I open a store when I can open a country?"'

Boohoo.com is not the only fast fashion retailer to break into the U.S. market of late. Earlier this month, it was announced that Primark will be opening seven stores across the Northeastern U.S. over the next year to 18 months, located in large shopping mall spaces leased by Sears.

Two destinations have so far been announced as part of the deal; the Staten Island Mall in New York City, and the King of Prussia Mall in Philadelphia.

The Boohoo.com pop-up is located at 462 West Broadway in SoHo, New York and will be open until November 15.
