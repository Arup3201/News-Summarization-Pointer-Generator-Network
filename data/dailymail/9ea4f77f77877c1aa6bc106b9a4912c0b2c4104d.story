Her job is to present the national news but one concerned TV viewer believes the ABC's Virginia Trioli is not paying enough attention to her appearance.

The anonymous critic took it upon themselves to inform the 50-year-old journalist she is 'definitely in need of a makeover'.

In a harsh letter, which the ABC News Breakfast host posted on Twitter alongside the caption 'Mails in #justagirlonabudget', Ms Trioli was instructed that she should stop wearing 'blacks and browns' because they are 'very ageing'.

ABC News Breakfast presenter Virginia Trioli laughed when she received a handwritten letter about her appearance from concerned viewer who is not a fan of her dark glasses

The journalist posted the letter, which explains 'I feel you are definitely in need of a make-over', on Twitter

The handwritten memo starts off by saying: 'I watch you every morning,' and goes on to tell Ms Trioli she should change her glasses.

'Next the glasses ugh! Go for the light coloured frames, as with your dark eyes, black make you look "owlish". You will be very pleasantly surprised,' they said.

The rude writer asks 'dare I say it, did you obtain your clothes from charity shops?'.

'This letter is NOT meant to insult you but so that you look 40 not 60,' they add.

The rude writer asked Ms Trioli 'dare I say it, did you obtain your clothes from charity shops?'

On Friday night she hit back by posting a photo of her self glammed up in a black dress

They sign off 'good luck! Looking forward to seeing a new Virginia.' 

Ms Trioli took the letter on the chin, despite its many insults.

Responding to comments made on Twitter about the note, she said: 'You are all very funny. Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to the op shop. #fashionpolice'

And on Friday night she hit back by posting a photo of her self glammed up in heels and a black dress while at a journalism awards night in Melbourne.

'Looking crappy as ever,' she joked.

Ms Trioli told the Guardian Australia that she often receives comments from viewers about her looks.

'My reaction is just to be myself and not let it occupy a tiny bit of my time. I can’t afford for it to be a distraction, I have to get through three hours of live TV every day,' she said.
