It has been giving Britain’s aristocracy advice on social etiquette for more than 200 years.

Now Debrett’s is branching out from producing guides on elegant manners and will start offering courses in social skills to jobseekers.

The publishing house is offering residential and day courses - starting at a £1,000 - to a generation of young people who struggle to make eye contact or proffer a firm handshake.

The publishing house is to offer courses to young people who lack social skills needed in the workplace

Debrett’s developed its programme on ‘social intelligence’ for under-30s after business leaders raised serious issues around young people entering the modern workplace.

Its research highlights concerns over the employability of graduates and school leavers who have no idea how to behave at work.

Debrett’s says that ‘manners, social intelligence, personal presentation and impact can be as important as academic qualifications.

‘With so much focus on exam results and the hectic informality of modern family life and technology, social graces can be a casualty.’ 

The courses come amid accusations that schools and universities are so focused on academic targets that they are failing to produce rounded graduates.

Instead they are turning out young people who are shy and awkward after spending all their time on the internet or mobiles, who lack the ability to spell or write a letter, and are unable to get through a day without regular online checks on what their friends are up to.

Louise Ruell , Debrett’s director of training, said: ‘Young employees need to differentiate themselves beyond their academic achievements.

Employers listed dependency on the internet and text jargon as some of the reasons why young people are so ill equipped in the workplace

The research clearly shows that this is often lacking.’

Ninety per cent of the senior executives on a panel at Debrett’s believe social skills are just as important, or even more important, than academic skills.

Some 63 per cent said their office juniors often lack any such skills at all. A quarter said they had even embarrassed them in front of clients.

Meanwhile, one in four business leaders complained that prospective candidates had inflated expectations regarding salaries and career progression and were over-confident and formulaic in interviews.

Misplaced informality was another complaint. Some 21per cent of employers said young employees had dressed inappropriately for the workplace or had drunk too much at work social events.

Amelia Higham, managing director of Dovetail Insurance, said: ‘There is so much emphasis on passing written exams that there’s no room for them to be taught life skills.

‘Throw in text jargon and overuse of the internet to communicate and you’ve got a generation which cannot connect one to one. Being a nice person to do business with is crucial no matter what business you are in.’

She said she would prefer a job applicant to have good social skills rather than perfect academic grades.

‘We have just had a chap in. On paper he looked fabulous - he had brilliant qualifications. On the second day he had to write a letter - he couldn’t do it. It was appalling really.

‘It’s the whole ethos of this generation - they miss a trick with their attitude of expectation.

‘We all expected to do rough jobs during the summer holidays or whatever, pick fruit, knock on doors selling things, working in a factory. Those jobs taught life skills.

‘Every teenager should have to do some sort of summer job. It would teach them not to rely on the bank of mum and dad and help their development as well.’

The publishing house considers itself an expert on 'knowing the who's who and what's what of today's Britain'

Almost three quarters of the 58 business leaders in the survey did agree that a preoccupation with technology hurts the social skills of young employees, affecting their ability to build relationships with clients.

Even firms whose business is in the digital world are concerned.

Linford Haggie, managing director at Graphic Alliance, a digital advertising agency, said: ‘We want candidates who live and breathe the digital world but too many are over-reliant on technology.

‘They are shy and scared. They don’t want to pick up a phone and have lost any people skills. I don’t blame them, no, they need to have the working world demystified and schools and businesses have a part to play.’
