Criticism: Barrister Kate Blackwell, who was criticised for the tough questioning of a sex assault victim who later committed suicide tried to claim the case's notoriety meant she should escape a driving ban

A barrister criticised for the tough questioning of a sex assault victim who later committed suicide tried to claim the case’s notoriety meant she should escape a driving ban.

Kate Blackwell QC argued she had been ‘vilified’ after the case and insisted it would not be safe for her  to use public transport because she and her children had been sent threatening letters.

But her argument, after she was caught speeding at 63mph in a 40mph zone, failed when magistrates rejected her claims that the publicity had left her vulnerable.

Miss Blackwell defended former choirmaster Michael Brewer last year at his trial for sex offences. But she was attacked for her tough cross-examination of violinist Frances Andrade – whom Brewer abused as a schoolgirl.

Less than a week later Mrs Andrade, a 48-year-old mother of four, took a fatal overdose. Her family said she had not been able to face being called a ‘liar’ and a ‘fantasist’ in court.

Brewer and his wife Hilary were later both found guilty of indecent assault, with the judge stressing he had no concerns about Miss Blackwell’s line of questioning.

This week the barrister, 44, attempted to use the public anger the case provoked to avoid receiving a driving ban.

Blackwell, herself a mother of four, was recorded speeding in south Manchester last September.

With nine points already on her licence, the QC – who appeared under her married name, Katherine Rogelj – faced an automatic ban. But Buxton magistrates were  told a ban would be an exceptional hardship, particularly with her now ex-husband spending most of his time  living in Slovenia.

Miss Blackwell claimed publicity around the Brewer trial had left her fearful of using public transport.

She told magistrates: ‘I was representing the defendant facing historical sexual offences and shortly after I cross-examined the complainant she committed suicide.’

Richard Silver, defending, told the court: ‘She hadn’t done anything other than her correct duty.’

Miss Blackwell was asked by Mr Silver: ‘Is it right you were vilified in the Press for that case.’ She replied: ‘Yes.’

He continued: ‘And received threatening letters in which you and your children were threatened? And your photograph was published in the papers?’

She replied: ‘Yes. I was also followed back to chambers on several occasions.’

Mr Silver went on: ‘Do you have a concern if you have to use public transport?’ Miss Blackwell replied: ‘Yes.’

He added a road ban would make it almost impossible for her to get to various courts with her heavy caseload.

But chairman of the bench, Hilary Batterbee, rejected his argument, telling Miss Blackwell: ‘The reason you work in various locations and are transporting large amount of boxes and files will be very difficult, but we believe other arrangements would be made.’

Miss Blackwell, of Didsbury, Manchester, had five points imposed and was banned for six months, although this was suspended pending appeal. She was ordered to pay a £650 fine and £100 costs.

Brewer, now 69, who was director of music at renowned Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester in the 1980s, was convicted of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade when she was 14 and 15 but cleared of raping her.

His ex-wife was jailed for 21 months after she was convicted of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade when she was 18. After the death of Mrs Andrade, who taught the violin at a £25,000-a-year girls’ school in Surrey, rape support groups said judges needed to do more to ensure trials were not ‘reduced to an attack on the witness’.

In April a review concluded Mrs Andrade’s suicide ‘could and should have been prevented’, directing particular criticism at mental health teams for refusing her therapy until after the trial despite previous overdoses.

It also recommended police and prosecutors remain in contact with vulnerable witnesses after they have finished giving evidence.
