A poaching ring illegally slaying deer in a spree of 'thrill killings' was cracked after one member posted a picture on Facebook.

The incriminating photograph appeared to show Jose Manuel Ortega-Torres lumbering a dead animal over his shoulder in the baking summer sunlight - months before the fall hunting season.

Game officials were tipped off in June 2013, sparking a lengthy investigation that uncovered a gang of 'thrill killers' in Las Vegas, Nevada, who shot game for no other purpose than to kill them.

Nevada Department of Wildlife spokesman Edwin Lyngar said: 'People do not poach to feed their families. In the vast majority of cases, the meat is left behind. We call these thrill killings, where people do it for their ego.

'They were taking some of the meat, but that doesn’t seem to be the motivating factor.'

A search of Ortega-Torres's home found illegally-killed deer, migratory birds and a stash of weaponry, Fox News reported.

The findings led them to his associates: Adrian Acevedo-Hernandez, 36, Jose Luis Montufar-Canales, 31, and J. Nemias Reyes Marin, 31,

The group is believed to have illegally obtained licenses and tags to hunt.

'We had a systematic killing, illegal killing, of wildlife,' Lyngar said. 'We will never know the total amount that they killed.'

All bar Ortega-Torres are facing federal charges for possessing firearms as it is believed they are illegal immigrants.

Awaiting further trials, Acevedo-Hernandez has already been convicted of unlawfully possessing three deer, ordered to pay $5,000, and forfeit seven firearms and a truck.

Montufar-Canales was convicted of falsely obtaining a hunting license.
