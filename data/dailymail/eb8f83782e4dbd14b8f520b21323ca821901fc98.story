Shoulder to shoulder, the Thatcher family formed a touching guard of honour as the matriarch embarked on her final journey.

They stood all in black in quiet dignity while they watched the coffin make its way from St Paul’s Cathedral.

Later, they would grieve in private. But this was the moment they put on a display of togetherness in full view of the millions watching the great lady’s send-off.

Faces of grief: The Thatcher family, left to right, including Carol Thatcher, her friend Marco Grass, Sarah Thatcher with her husband Sir Mark, and children Michael and Amanda watch the coffin depart from St Paul's

The line-up was dominated by the towering figure of Sir Mark Thatcher, who bore a dignified grimace.

Sir Mark, 59, who was flanked by his wife Sarah and his children from his first marriage, looked baggy-eyed and totally bereft.

Sarah – now the only Lady Thatcher – was clearly holding back her emotions too.

Her face was elegantly made up but her eyes appeared red from tears.

Both she and Sir Mark’s twin sister Carol wore pillbox-style hats and pearls.

The
Iron Lady’s daughter, who is looking increasingly like her mother, 
carried an equally studied expression as she pushed back her tinted 
blonde hair.

Her on-off partner Marco Grass was a surprise addition to the line-up.

He is a ski instructor and lives with her in the fashionable resort of Klosters in the Swiss Alps, and the exact nature of their relationship is unclear.

Baroness Thatcher’s only 
grandchildren, Michael, 24, and Amanda, 19, stood proudly next to their 
father. Amanda was elegant in Mary Jane-style heels and a black fitted 
and slightly flared above-the-knee coat.

In contrast, with his athletic stance, football-playing Michael looked like an all-American hero.

It was a family portrait that the former prime minister would surely have found deeply touching.

All
of them found it impossible to tear their eyes away as her coffin was 
gingerly loaded on to the hearse before being driven away.

Later came a reminder of the private family grief that lay behind a highly public ceremonial occasion.

Miss Thatcher was seen weeping as she said a final goodbye to her mother at Mortlake Crematorium, south-west London.

After rushing to comfort her, the family walked together into the chapel with their arms round one another.

Hundreds
of onlookers had lined the street and gently applauded as the coffin 
passed through the gates, which were guarded by police.

The officers saluted as the hearse entered the grounds.

Two
coaches carrying guests had arrived at the crematorium half an hour 
earlier for the 30-minute private service, at the same venue where Sir 
Denis Thatcher was cremated in 2003.

His wife’s ashes will eventually be buried alongside his in the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea.
