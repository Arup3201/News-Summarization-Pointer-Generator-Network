Ronald Reagan's granddaughter has sparked a furor after she posted a photograph of herself with a man dressed as an al-Qaeda suicide bomber to Facebook.

In the image, Ashley Marie Reagan, the daughter of Ronald Reagan's adopted son, Michael Reagan, who is a conservative talk-radio host, has an arm around an unidentified man who has a fake bomb strapped to his chest.

The man is wearing a white robe that 
covers the top of his head and a mask that's a caricature of an Islamic 
terrorist, with a beard and large nose.

Outrage: Ronald Reagan's granddaughter, Ashley, has sparked a furor after she posted a photograph of herself with a man dressed as an al-Qaeda suicide bomber, pictured

According to the National Enquirer, 
Nancy Reagan, 92, is disgusted in Ashley's behavior, and 
has told those around her that the late former president would be too.

'Nancy is old but lucid enough to know that Ronnie would be spinning in his grave over the irresponsible behavior of his granddaughter,' The Enquirer quoted a family insider as saying.

A grinning Ashley is wearing a camouflage outfit and has a plastic cup in her hand, which presumably contains alcohol.

Foundation: The 30-year-old, shown here with her uncle Roger, is a kindergarten teacher but also serves as the office director of the Reagan Legacy Foundation

Upset: Nancy Reagan, pictured in 2012, is reportedly disgusted in Ashley's behavior

The 30-year-old is a kindergarten teacher but also serves as the office director of the Reagan Legacy Foundation.

The California-based organization is charged with advancing Reagan's favorite causes and keeping his memory and presidential accomplishments alive.

The Enquirer reported that the former first lady found the picture particularly hard to take because her husband was commander in chief during the 1983 terrorist attacks in Lebanon.

More than 240 U.S. servicemen lost their lives in the attacks.

Nancy Reagan's health has been ailing
 of late, with reports suggesting she has a lung condition that makes it
 difficult for her to breathe.Â 

'Nancy
 is already extremely frail,' the magazine quoted the source as saying, 
adding that the stress from Ashley's shock picture only added to her 
health woes.

But the insider added that she is only 'glad that Ronnie didn't live to see this disgrace.'

Sad: The Enquirer reported that the former first lady, pictured at her husband's 2004 funeral, found the photo particularly hard to take because her husband was commander in chief during the 1983 terrorist attacks in Lebanon
