A woman who swallowed a $4,000 ring as police pulled her over on suspicion of stealing it has been arrested along with another male suspect.

Bryan Ford, 30, and 25-year-old Christina Schlegel were pulled over half an hour after allegedly driving off with a ring worth $4,350 from a Zales store in Orem, Utah.

Staff at the store reported the crime to the police, saying the pair got away in a car with its licence plate covered in pink sticky notes.  

Christina Sclegel, 25, and Bryan Ford, 30, were arrested  after police say they stole a ring worth $4,350 from a Zanes store before making a getaway in a car with its licence plate covered by sticky notes

But after officers stopped the duo, they had to X-ray Schlegel in order to get the ring back after she admitted swallowing it while being chased. 

Ford and Schlegel allegedly made off with the item of jewelry on Friday afternoon after going into the store on the pretense of buying it.

According to police an attendant at the store chased Ford into the parking lot and saw him climb into a Pontiac G6 which had the licence plate covered in pink sticky notes before driving off.

Officers then spotted a vehicle matching the description half an hour later and stopped the car. Police brought a Zales employee to the scene, and when she identified Ford the pair were arrested.

After leading officers on several 'wild goose chases' in search of the ring, Schlegel admitted she had swallowed it, and an X-ray showed it was lodged in her stomach (pictured)

However officers could find no trace of the ring, and said they were sent on 'several wild goose chases' before Schlegel eventually admitted swallowing it.

She was taken to a hospital where an x-ray revealed the precious item lodged in her stomach. Doctors then checked her over before she was sent to jail.

Both Ford and Schlegel were both booked into the Utah County Jail on suspicion of felony-level theft.
