A hotel package aimed exclusively at women without children has been launched in New York.

The Westin New York Grand Central has teamed up with author Melanie Notkin, the leading voice of the nearly 50 per cent of American ladies who are childless, to offer a special Womanhood Redefined break.

The hotel invites females to 'celebrate their own personal journey' on a three-night getaway which focuses on food, health and well-being.

Time to reflect: The getaway is geared towards the large percentage of American women who are childless

Priced at £140 ($235) per night, the package - which promises to re-energise your mind and body - includes personal consultations with the hotel's executive chef Brian Wieler and running expert.

A copy of Notkin's book Otherhood is also thrown in as well as loaned workout gear from New Balance.

Guests also receive a £15 food and drink credit, a 10 per cent discount on classes at the nearby Mang’Oh Yoga Studio and the icing on the cake - a free Westin White Tea candle.

First of its kind in New York: The Womanhood Redefined break is on offer at the Westin Grand Central

Melissa Braverman, the marketing manager for the hotel, told the New York Times: 'As a woman who is 40 and single and who doesn’t have children, it was a resonant topic to me. 

'I’m kind of in a place in my life where I’m like: "What’s the opposite of a procreation vacation?"'
