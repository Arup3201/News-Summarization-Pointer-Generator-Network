A trainee dietician chowed down four stuffed Chipotle burritos in three minutes - something, hopefully, he would never advise his patients to do.

Matt Stonie, 21, from California, who is currently studying towards a degree in nutrition, filmed himself pulling off the stunt as part of his sideline career in competitive eating.

In his YouTube video - which has been watched more than one million times - he explains that he will be devouring four wraps which stack up to around 3,700 calories.

Gut-busting: Matt Stonie, a trainee dietician from California, chowed down four stuffed Chipotle burritos in three minutes - the meal totaled around 3,700 calories

Healthy appetite: The 21-year-old filmed himself pulling off the stunt as part of his sideline career in competitive eating - he is currently ranked second in the world

Challenge complete: At two minutes 59 seconds, Mr Stonie wipes his mouth and forehead in seeming exhaustion - he washed down his giant meal with a large cup of Diet Coke

Mr Stonie said that he opted for two chicken burritos and two steak, each stuffed with white rice, black beans, sour cream and salsa.

To wash it all down, he plumped for a large Diet Coke. His check came to $34.23 before tax and tip.

In the film, simply titled 4 Chipotle Burritos & A Diet Coke, he is seen using his hands to shovel each wrap into his mouth, being careful to remove the aluminum wrapping beforehand.

Just as the clock signals the second minute he finally tucks into the last burrito.

Then, at two minutes 59 seconds, he finishes the last mouthful, wiping his mouth and forehead in seeming exhaustion.

One viewer who watched Mr Stonie's video exclaims in the comment section: 'Dude, my stomach hurts from just watching.'

Quite a mouthful: Each was stuffed with white rice, black beans, sour cream and salsa

Shoveling it in: Mr Stonie, nicknamed 'Megatoad', is the second ranked competitive eater in the world and one of the youngest members of the Major League Eating organization

Another adds:' Damn lol [sic]  I can barely finish one burrito.' ﻿Mr Stonie, nicknamed 'Megatoad', is the second ranked competitive eater in the world and one of the youngest members of the Major League Eating organization. 

According to his Major League Eating biography, his 5ft 6in frame weighs a slight 120lbs.

Many fans question how he doesn't get fat demolishing such huge portion sizes but Mr Stonie maintains a strict diet and exercise schedule when he's not competitive eating.

His records include demolishing a 5.5lb birthday cake in eight minutes 59 seconds at his own 21st birthday party and devoring 10.5lbs of frozen yogurt in six minutes.

Mr Stonie’s burrito feat was a personal challenge and not part of a competition.

Recently he also polished off 12 Cinnabon rolls - totaling more than 11,000 calories - in just under ten minutes just for 'high jinks'.

'I feel like hell,' he said after eating the iced pastries.
