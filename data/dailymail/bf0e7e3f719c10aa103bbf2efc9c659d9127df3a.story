The father of a young British man who has been lost in the thick bushland and gullies of Australia’s Blue Mountains for 10 bitterly cold nights today admitted he believes that his son is dead.

David Tweddle, who has flown out to Australia from his home in Reading with his wife Michelle, has been waiting anxiously in the mountains as hundreds of searchers hunted for 23-year-old Gary Tweddle.

Gary was last heard from during a late night phone call to friends staying at a hotel resort in the mountains, west of Sydney, when he told them he was lost in bushland.

Curiously, however, a motorist has told police that he saw a man answering Gary’s description - and wearing the same checkered pink shirt - trying to wave down a car at the roadside not far from the hotel shortly after midnight.

It is not known if that sighting was before or after Gary told his friends that he was lost.

His father today said in a farewell message to his son which he posted on Facebook that he loved him very much - but told followers that what had been a search and rescue operation conducted by police and fire service officials had now been re-classifeid as a ‘recovery operation’.

The change of circumstances in the search means that rescuers are now looking for a body, rather than someone who might have been able to survive the unforgiving conditions during which temperatures have dropped below zero at night.

In an emotional message to his son, who moved to Australia four years ago to start a new life and had won a top job at a technology firm, Mr Tweddle wrote: ‘I miss and love you unconditionally, Gaz.  

Missing: Gary Tweddle, 23, had gone for a walk from his hotel in the mountains, near Sydney, when he called friends to say he was lost in bushland - that was the last time anyone heard from him

‘I am so proud of all you have achieved at Oracle’  - the technology company - ‘and with your private life. The depth of this pride is infinite. You are a true star in all our lives.

‘We have had so many incredible times together in UK, ZA (South Africa) and Goa to name a few and there is nothing I would not give for 1 more second of time with you.

‘Money, possessions and material becomes irrelevant now. It’s all about time, so my closing message to you my friends is cherish every second you are fortunate enough to have with the people you love.

‘Waste not one moment, be available and show love at every opportunity. I love you so much son, so, so much. Dad X.’   

Mr Tweddle compared Gary’s plight with that of British bushwalker Jamie Neale, who was found alive after going missing for 12 days in the Blue Mountains at the same time of year four years ago.

Mr Neale was wearing warm clothes and had supplies in a backpack, whereas Gary, who had earlier been drinking with his friends before deciding to take a walk from the resort hotel, was wearing just a shirt and jeans.

Mr Tweddle and Gary’s stepmother are expected to return to the UK at the weekend or early next week.
