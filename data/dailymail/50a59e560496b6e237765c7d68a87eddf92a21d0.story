Lottery players in America are bracing the cold weather to snap up $2 Powerball tickets, with tonight's jackpot up to a whopping $317 million.

It marks the biggest prize fund in almost a year, with 18 consecutive draws since December 3 2014 and no big-prize winner.

The $317 jackpot marks an increase of $31.2 million from Saturday's prize, which vendors say is down to 'brisk' ticket sales.   

Feeling lucky? Lottery players in America are bracing the cold weather to snap up $2 Powerball tickets, with tonight's jackpot up to a whopping $317 million

The prize marks the 11th largest Powerball jackpot ever and the 22nd largest in U.S. history when including Mega Millions, the other national lottery game.

Cut-off times for ticket sales vary by state but typically end 59 minutes before the drawing.

The winning numbers will be announced at 10:59pm ET (0259 GMT) on local television networks and on the official Powerball website. 

The jackpot - won by matching all five white balls in any order and the red Powerball - is either an annuitized prize paid out over 29 years or a lump sum payment.

For tonight's draw, the one-time lump sum payment would be $220.6 million.

The second prize - won by matching five white balls in any order - is $1,000,000 paid in cash and any time a player matches the red Powerball, they win.

The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately 1 in 32. 

But the chances of winning the big prize, regardless of how many tickets a player buys, are one in 175 million.

Powerball is played in 44 states, Washington, Peurto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Draws take place bi-weekly, on Saturdays and Wednesdays.

Indiana leads the nation in Powerball jackpot wins at 38. The highest jackpot win for the state was for $314 million.

The largest Powerball jackpot was $590.5 million, won by a Florida woman in May 2013.

Before the latest prize, Powerball's last major jackpot was in February 2014 when it was $425 million.
