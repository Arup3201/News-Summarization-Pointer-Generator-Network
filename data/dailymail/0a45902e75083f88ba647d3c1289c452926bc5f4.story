From smart boxes to cable services, there are more ways than ever to watch television.

Now, network operator EE has launched what it claims is the UK’s 'most advanced TV service' that combines live and recorded programmes across TV sets, mobiles and tablets.

It uses a specially-designed EE TV smart box, which is free on contracts that start at £9.95 a month.

The company hopes to compete with rivals BT and TalkTalk, which have won over customers by offering premium programming as part of their respective broadband packages.

The service is focused on mobile viewing, so tablets and smartphones will ‘work seamlessly’ with home TVs, allowing customers to access Freeview, live and catch-up services across multiple devices.

EE TV also lets viewers watch programmes on their home TV, as well as on up to three smartphones or tablets simultaneously.

This means four different programmes, in four different rooms, on four different devices could be viewed at the same time.

The user interface of the box is designed to mimic that of a smartphone.

‘Live windows’ gives instant access to a visual menu including a TV guide, recorded content and on-demand services.

EE TV requires a smart box (pictured) to offer the functionality, and this box is free on packages starting at £9.95 a month. The TV box has a 1TB hard drive that stores up to 600 hours of standard TV, or 300 hours of HD

Claim: EE claims its TV services is the 'most advanced service' in the UK.

Multi-screen experience: Users can pause, rewind or record live and pre-recorded programmes simultaneously on up to four devices – from TV to smartphones and tablets.

Remote control: Viewers can use their phone or tablet as a remote control. The EE TV app lets users browse and watch programmes, plan ahead or manage recordings without interrupting what’s on the TV.

Replay and restart: Using the replay feature, the service records the user’s six favourite channels so they can view anything from the past 24 hours. Users can click ‘restart’ to catch the beginning of a missed show.

Content: As well as the 70 channels offered on Freeview, EE TV offers catch up services such as BBC iPlayer, 5OD and Wuaki.tv. Daily Motion, You Tube and The Weather Network are also available.

TV box: The TV box has a 1TB hard drive that can store up to 600 hours of standard TV, or 300 hours of HD.

Future-proof: EE TV is HTML 5 compatible and new content and apps will be updated and developed.

Price: The box is free for EE mobile customers who sign up to an EE Broadband plan from £9.95 a month.

Availability: The box will become available in EE stores in the coming weeks. 

The system is designed to make programme clashes a thing of the past. 

A multi-screen system lets users stream live and recorded content directly from the EE TV box’s hard drive, using a new remote app for iOS and Android devices.

A replay feature will additionally let customers view the last 24 hours of TV, and organises recent shows by genres or channels – even if they are not yet available on catch-up services,

Like some other TV boxes, a MultiRecord function means four programmes can be recorded simultaneously.

Programmes are stored directly on the EE TV box, which has a 1TB hard disk drive, with space for up to 25 days of TV content.

The service will let people to use their smartphone or tablet as a remote control. 

For example, viewers will be able to use the EE TV app to navigate the guide and select the content they want to watch on their mobile device, without interrupting what is displayed on the TV screen.

EE, which is jointly owned by Orange and Deutsche Telekom, said its smart box is worth £300 but will be free for all EE mobile customers who sign up to an EE Broadband plan.

Customers with existing pay monthly mobile plans who sign up to EE TV and home broadband will receive a boost in their 4G allowance by up to 20GB, depending on their plan.

The company has designed EE TV for people with 4G access on their mobiles and tablets. 

It added that video content already makes up more than half of EE’s 4G mobile network activity.

‘Today we’re announcing the most advanced TV service the UK has ever seen. 

'How, where and when people watch TV and movies is changing, and mobile technology is driving that change, said Olaf Swantee, chief executive of EE.

‘[EE has] unrivalled insight into people’s changing viewing habits. 

'It’s helped us create a service that has mobile at its heart, and makes the TV experience more personal than ever before.

‘With EE TV, not only can you watch different streams of live and recorded content, on multiple screens simultaneously, but your mobile becomes the remote. 

'This gives each viewer the chance to watch, queue and view what they want, when they want. It’s a completely new way to enjoy your favourite programmes, films and internet content.’

EE’s service will be similar to other offerings on the market.

That model has proved popular in recent years to customers who want more than the basic television service, but are not willing to pay for the full TV subscription services offered by the likes of BSkyB and Virgin Media.

BT, for example, has helped grow its broadband business since launching a high-profile sports service.

EE has repositioned itself in recent years, stealing a march on its competitors by becoming the first mobile operator in Britain to offer superfast 4G services, nearly a year before rivals Vodafone and Telefonica's O2 were able to compete.

Commenting on the launch, Paolo Pescatore, Director of apps and media at market intelligence firm CCS Insight, said it is ‘hugely significant’. 

‘It demonstrates the growing need for telcos to offer multi-play services. It's a logical move from EE and one that's in direct response to BT launching its mobile service next year. 

'EE has thrown down the gauntlet and today's announcement puts the pressure on others to accelerate their own quad-play plans. With this in mind the UK market is now ripe for consolidation.’ 

‘EE will be the first of the four major mobile network operators to launch a quad-play service and it represents a statement of intent by the company to offer content in order to sell more broadband connections.’ 

He said that the company has seen growth in its broadband business and is in a stronger position that other quad-play providers – Virgin Media and TalkTalk. 

‘EE has taken a sensible approach with its TV service as it doesn’t want to be embroiled in bidding wars for premium content. However given the exclusion of Netflix, EE must strongly consider forging agreements with other key rights owners including BSkyB for Now TV. 

'The company must also strengthen the range of on-demand services as this is becoming increasingly important to consumers as underlined by Netflix’s growth,’ Mr Pescatore added.

EE’s service will be similar to other offerings on the market, providing the UK’s biggest broadcast channels and other programming such as movies on an on-demand basis. Here, a user watches content on a tablet, while a TV guide is shown on their main TV
