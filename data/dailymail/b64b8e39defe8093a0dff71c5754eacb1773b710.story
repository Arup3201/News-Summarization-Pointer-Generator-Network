Death probe: The HSE is investigating the death of Savita Halappanavar died of blood poisoning after doctors refused her an abortion

The independence of a probe into the death of a mother who was refused an abortion in Ireland has been questioned after a series of blunders.

The HSE investigation has bowed to pressure to remove three doctors from the seven-member inquiry panel because they were from Galway University Hospital, the hospital where Savita Halappanavar died, after a conflict of interest was questioned.

Now it has emerged that the professor leading the investigation had previously helped write a report which was written in favour of more liberal abortion laws.

Mrs Halappanavar, 31, died of blood poisoning after Irish doctors refused her an abortion at 17 weeks pregnant when she began miscarrying. She died of septicaemia a week later on October 28.

Her grieving husband Praveen Halappanavar, 34, told how he begged doctors at Galway University Hospital to terminate the pregnancy, but they refused to do so because she was 'in a Catholic country' and the foetus's heartbeat was still present. 

In a recent interview he said that he has no intention of cooperating with the HSE investigation.

Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny has said
that the three replacement experts would ‘have no connection at all 
with Galway University Hospital. In that sense the investigation will be
completely and utterly independent’.

Pro-life campaigners have argued that the head investigator, Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, head of obstetrics and gynaecology and deputy head of clinical sciences at St George’s Hospital in London, should not be allowed to stay on after revelations about a medical paper he co-wrote in 2009.

The paper, entitled Safer Childbirth: A Rights-Based Approach, says that countries with more liberal abortion laws have lower death rates from pregnancy.

The HSE stated that it would be challenging to find any obstetrician who did not have an opinion on pro-life or pro-choice issues and argued that Prof Arulkumaran’s qualification in the field was ‘beyond reproach’ and that his opinions previously expressed were irrelevant to the probe.

In response to Mr Halappanavar's refusal to help the investigation, Prof Arulkumaran hoped to persuade the grieving husband to talk to investigators. His testimony on Mrs Halappanavar’s care was essential to identifying problems, the professor said.

Thousands of protesters took to the streets in rallies around Ireland on Saturday to pay tribute to Mrs Halappanavar as campaigners demanded changes in the law to allow abortion in the case where the mother's life is in danger.

The Irish Health Minister James Reilly is set to present a report to Cabinet next week from a group of abortion experts but will not make any recommendation.

The Irish Council for Civil Liberties
is pushing for an independent inquiry. They said that the best way to 
involve hospital staff in the investigation was to call them as 
witnesses rather than panel members.

Director
Mark Kelly was quoted in the Irish Independent saying: ‘This remains an
internal HSE investigation into the conduct of persons employed by the 
HSE.’

India's ambassador to Ireland said last week that Mrs Halappanavar might still be alive today if she had been treated in India. 

Debashish Chakravarti told RTÉ radio that he hoped the Irish government would take steps to ensure the circumstances which led to her death never arose again.  

Mr Halappanavar, who works as an engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, came to Ireland from India with his wife four years ago to start a new life together. She had a job in Westport, Co Mayo and the pair lived in Galway city.

They were so excited about the expected birth of their first child, which was due on March 20, that they had an early baby shower in recent weeks when Mrs Halappanavar’s parents were visiting.
