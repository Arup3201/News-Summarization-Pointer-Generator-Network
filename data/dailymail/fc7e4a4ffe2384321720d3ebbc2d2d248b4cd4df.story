When you’ve shelled out a small fortune on a pukka pair of personalised shoes, it’s nice to get the chance to show them off.

That opportunity arose for Prince Harry while chatting to children at an awards ceremony last night.

As he kneeled down to talk to the youngsters, the soles flashed with a capital letter H studded into each one with shiny brass tacks.

The shoes, costing about £1,500, were handmade at John Lobb, which is close to St James’s Palace and holds three Royal Warrants.

Adorable: Prince Harry had the pleasure of meeting Carson Hartley, four, from Liverpool. Carson was born three months prematurely with a heart defect, chronic lung disease, spina bifida and brittle bone disease

Harry laughed with delight as Carson ran around him before leaning over and giving him a hug and a high five

Mrs Hartley told Harry that Carson had four other siblings. ‘I would hate to have four sisters,’ the prince joked.

Harry displayed his bespoke footwear at the WellChild Awards in Central London to honour the courage of youngsters with serious medical conditions.

The prince, one of charity’s patrons, laughed with delight as Carson Hartley, four, from Liverpool, ran around him before hugging him and giving him a high five.

Carson has had 40 operations for illnesses including a heart defect, lung disease and spina bifida. He also has to carry a machine around with him to breathe through a tube.

He has had more than 40 operations and is permanently ventilated via a tracheostomy and has to carry a machine around with him. 

‘He’s a livewire. I bet he keeps you on his toes,’ he said to his parents, Damian, 23, and Kirsty, 34.

Mrs Hartley told Harry that Carson had four other siblings. ‘I would hate to have four sisters,’ the prince joked.

Afterwards Mrs Hartley said: ‘He told me that he couldn’t believe how much energy he had and how he couldn’t believe how happy he was given everything that has happened. He was absolutely lovely and just amazing with Carson.’

In a reception at the Park Lane Hilton in London, the prince was also introduced to Maddison Sherwood, six, who gave him a home-made card with a drawing she had done of him - with bright ginger hair.

‘Is that meant to be me?’ he laughed but took the joke in good spirits.

Maddison, from East Keale, Northamptonshire, was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy in 2009 when she was ten months old. Her condition causes severe muscle weakness and she relies on a ventilator. 

When she was born her parents, Lidia and Jamie, were told she would never talk, eat or be able to support her own head – but she now attends mainstream school and can do everything her family was warned against.

Mrs Sherwood, 28, said: ‘We asked him how old he was – we had read that he was 30 but pretended we didn’t know. He told me that he was feeling very old.

‘He also told Maddison that she was doing wonderfully and that she should carry on and do what she was doing as she had proved everyone wrong so far.’

Another award winner who left the Harry speechless was Olivia Ruston who presented the prince with an hilarious pottery piggy bank she had made with a shock of ginger hair.

‘Is that meant to be me?’ he roared, ‘that’s just brilliant.’

‘I haven’t had one since I was a child so I had better start saving my pennies in it,’ said the prince who recently was said to have inherited £10 million for his 30th birthday.

Olivia, ten, from Southport was receiving an award for the way in which she cares for her younger sister, Jessica, eight, who has acute medical needs. Olivia is trained to help with Jessica’s tracheotomy and can feed her sister through a peg in her stomach.

Her mother Alison, 35, said: ‘She is just remarkable.’

Harry has been patron of WellChild , the national charity for sick children, for seven years

Rosie Flory, 15, also gave Harry a wrist band and cards made from drawings created by her brother, Harry, who died in 2012 from a brain tumour.

Rosie, from Bournemouth, became Harry’s own Florence Nightingale and made sure his last months were happy and comfortable.

‘We spoke about how grief affects us in different ways and how we cope with it. Obviously he has had experience of losing someone close to him,’ she said.

The prince also admired a tiara worn by Rachel Hooley, ten, from Cramlington, Northumberland, who suffered acute heart failure when she was seven and was given a transplant at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle.

She recently took part in the British and World Transplant Games in everything from swimming to sprinting.

‘He loved my tiara and dress – I couldn’t believe it,’ she said.

Harry met 15-year-old Cecilia Adamou from Cobham, Surrey, who was born with a serious congenital heart condition and has bravely overcome a series of resulting complications.

‘I've had a heart transplant, a kidney transplant. I've also got two brain tumours, and two spinal tumours and some feet problems," she said. "I was told I would never walk again.’

‘Prince Harry said a lot of people in the Army are told that but they do walk again.’

She too has defied the doctors' predictions and is walking again. ‘Hopefully I'm over the worst it,’ she added.

Harry has been patron of WellChild , the national charity for sick children, for seven years and has described their annual awards ceremony as one of the highlights of his year. 

'You are an example to us all - we can learn a great deal from your strength of character,' the Prince said

In an emotional speech, Harry said: ‘I would like to congratulate each of the Award Winners - your stories are moving beyond words and remind us all of just how fantastic you all are.

'You are an example to us all - we can learn a great deal from your strength of character, resolve and humour in facing down challenges every day.'

Also joining the prince were celebrity guests including Vernon Kay, Gaby Roslin and singer Pixie Lott. 

Pixie, who is currently appearing on Strictly Come Dancing, said: ‘It’s just an honour to be here at such a heart-warming event. It makes you put everything in perspective. These children are so amazing and I wouldn’t miss it for the world.’

Asked about Strictly she said: ‘The training is going well but there is so much to learn, the steps are so complicated and the way you hold yourself is like nothing I have done before.

‘My first dance is on Friday – I can’t tell you what it is, it has to be a secret – but there has been a bit of treading on toes.

‘The only dancing I have done of late is for my music videos – and ballroom couldn’t be more different.’
