Thousands of children across the country were left devastated after hackers took down the PlayStation and Xbox online networks on Christmas Day.

While children were reduced to tears during the 'worst Christmas ever', parents fumed about paying hundreds of pounds for games consoles that could not be used.

In furious internet posts they demanded that console manufacturers Sony and Microsoft pay compensation for the worldwide fault and asked why it took so long for the problems to be corrected.

Mark Haynes said there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie (pictured), 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing

A notorious group of hackers called Lizard Squad said it carried out the hack 'for the laughs' and to expose poor online security.

The consoles rely on an internet connection for many of their functions. Parents were so angered by the issues with the machines, which cost up to £349, that they wrote hundreds of messages to both companies on Twitter accompanied by the message '#christmasruined'.

Ros Bruce said her ten-year-old son had spent weeks planning what games he and his friend would play together ahead of receiving an Xbox One for Christmas. The boy was sorely disappointed when he tried to download a game and was still unable to play it more than 15 hours later. 

Miss Bruce, from Essex, said: 'He has spent most of the day in tears. He says it's been his worst Christmas ever. I think Xbox should compensate us all.'

A Twitter user from Scotland also called for a refund and said: '£450 later and the kids have an expensive plastic paperweight.'

Mark Haynes told the Daily Mail there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie, 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing.

Mr Haynes, 50, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, criticised Microsoft's response to the problem after calling technical support four times only to be told by one staff member that the company 'had no idea what was going on'.

Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service

Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch'

The hack took down Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network. Popular games such as Call Of Duty and The Sims 4 were all but useless for frustrated gamers.

Analysts said that the attack was a DDOS, or distributed denial of service attack, in which online networks are overwhelmed by traffic, leaving normal users unable to gain access.

One of the most popular features of the consoles is the ability to play against friends and other users who are in different locations. This feature, however, requires an internet connection and many children were left disappointed at their inability to use it.

While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up.

Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack.

A message on the Xbox status page yesterday said that its core services were 'up and running' but PlayStation said engineers were continuing to work on 'network issues'.

There has been no official link between the incident and the infiltration of Sony's computers by hackers said to be working for North Korea.

However, Sony and Microsoft were heavily involved in the release of The Interview, the comedy film about the communist nation which has angered its tyrannical leader Kim Jong-Un; the film centres on a plot by two American journalists to assassinate him.

Sony's entertainment division produced the movie, and Microsoft made it available to stream on its Xbox film service.

There are 48million worldwide subscribers to the Xbox's internet features, and more than double that for the PlayStation, which has some 110million.

Last month Sony announced that it had sold one million consoles in the UK just eight months after launching, with a sales boost expected before Christmas.

In an interview on tech website Winbeta, Lizard Squad said that it had carried out the attack on Christmas Day to 'anger and reach the largest amount of people'. It claimed that the attack was to highlight poor online security and that Microsoft had barely any protection at all for its Xbox online network.
