At 49 years of age, Bernard Hopkins is not your average professional boxer.

The Philadelphia-born fighter may be just two months shy of his 50th birthday yet he holds the IBF, WBA and IBA light-heavyweight titles and is looking to add the WBO and WBC belts to that collection on Sunday morning.

A unification bout with Russian Sergey Kovalev could see the oldest-ever world champion achieve yet another incredible feat - by unifying the entire division in Atlantic City.

Bernard Hopkins is the oldest world champion in history at 49 and is looking to unify light-heavyweight divison

The American has re-launched himself as 'The Alien' in his last couple of world title fights

Watch the huge unification bout live on Box Nation (Sunday, 4am). 

Originally the self-professed 'Executioner', Hopkins used to walk to the ring with his head covered in a hangman's hood. Now though he has re-modelled himself and wears an alternative mask - that of an Extra Terrestrial - calling himself 'The Alien'.

Hopkins will be looking to takeout his opponent and unify the division. The American has 55 wins from 65 bouts - with six losses, two draws and two no contests - with 32 of those from knockouts.

He does, however, face an unenviable task against Kovalev. The Russian himself is nicknamed 'The Krusher' and Roman Simakov, who he beat in 2011, later died having slipped into a coma due to the sheer power of the punching from his opponent.

In anticipation of this huge fight, Sportsmail takes you through some of the incredible facts and figures that have shaped The Alien's career...
