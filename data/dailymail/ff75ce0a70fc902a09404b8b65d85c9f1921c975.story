A 'psychotic' killer who butchered a mother and son and was freed from Broadmoor hospital after just seven years has uploaded a video of himself sipping expensive whisky and flaunting his watch collection.

Gregory Davis, 35, stabbed Dorothy Rogers 31 times, then chased her fleeing son, 19-year-old Michael, to a children's playground and disembowelled him.

Davis - who has claimed he thought the world was an unreal game he could only escape by killing - planned the attacks in his diary before carrying them out in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in 2003.

Sipping whisky: Davis was also pictured drinking spirits in the video. He has since tried to mount of a defence of his attacks by emailing the victims' local paper

A court heard that he was gripped by a 'psychotic episode' at the time, and Davis was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility, and was sent to a high-security hospital rather than prison.

Davis was released in 2011 leaving the family of his victims disgusted after persuading a mental health tribunal he was well enough to be given a conditional discharge.

The conditions were lifted earlier this year and since then Davis has been taking advantage of his new-found freedoms.

He posted a video on YouTube showing off a glitzy watch collection and swigging the pricey drink.

In the video, which has now been taken down, he flashes his collection - with one Patek Phillipe thought to be worth around £25,000 and makes a show of drinking the spirit.

Davis tried to join a trip to Thailand with luxury watch collectors but they were 'horrified' when security checks revealed Davis's disturbing past.

The flashy display has left many wondering where he gets the cash for his ostentatious spending.

A former friend of Davis's victims said: 'The thought that Greg Davis is drinking alcohol again and spending thousands indulging his passion for watches is disgusting.

'He should never have been freed after such an horrendous crime.'

In a lengthy email sent this month to the victims' local newspaper, Davis mounts a 1,600 word defence of the killings, barely pausing to express any remorse for their deaths.

He claims he thought the world was a video game emanating from a blue orb on the back of his head, and the only way he could escape this 'unreality' was to commit horrific crimes.

He said: 'I thought that nothing was real in the world expect [sic] me and that I had created the world as a game to test myself.

'I believed this information was emanating from a blue orb in the back of my head and I had to do what it was telling me.

'I was convinced through the delusion that I had to be the opposite sort of person to how I had always been in order to break out of the unreality of the world I though I was trapped in.

'Since in my life I had always been a law-abiding, polite and kind person up to that point, I was deluded into believing that I had to do terrible things like killing people.'

He adds: 'Of course the terrible acts I committed will never be healed for the victims' families and I live with part of me destroyed by what I did.

'All I can do is try to live as good a life as possible and make a positive difference where I can.'
