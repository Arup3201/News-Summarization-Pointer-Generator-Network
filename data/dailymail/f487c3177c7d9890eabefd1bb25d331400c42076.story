A girl who had a violent fit and collapsed during a cross-country race died because of a "significant" delay getting her to hospital, a coroner ruled today.

Shannon Powell, 14, was competing in Trent Park, in north London in January this year, and the coroner said that neglect by race organisers contributed to her death.

First-aiders rushed to help the teenager and an ambulance was dispatched to the scene at noon, North London Coroner's Court heard.

Paramedics refused to carry 14-year-old schoolgirl Shannon Powell, who 
fatally collapsed during a cross country run, due to 'health and 
safety', an inquest heard

A post-mortem examination found she had a rare heart disorder called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

North London coroner Andrew Walker 
said: 'There was a significant delay for Shannon getting to hospital, 
which caused her death in the sense that there was an opportunity for 
rendering care which, if taken, would have prevented the death.

'The ambulance arrived at 12.06 and then spent 30 minutes trying to find the address, arriving at 12.36.

'The crew could not drive to where she lay as the gate and height restriction barrier were in place and locked.'

The ambulance was able to reach Shannon when a passer-by unlocked the gate.

Mr Walker said: 'The ambulance could not have arrived at the scene any earlier, given the information they had.

'Although the provision of first aid 
for the event had been considered and the team of first-aiders had been 
employed, little or no thought had been given to what should happen if 
an ambulance needed to attend a person at the event.

'All but one of the gates to the park
were locked and there was a mistaken belief that all London Ambulance 
Service vehicles had keys they could use to unlock the gates.'

He added that no risk assessment had 
taken place for the site for the provision of medical care and there 
were no clear details available to guide an ambulance to the correct 
gate.

He said: 'The instructions given to the marshals concerning what to do should a person need an ambulance were inadequate.'

Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Walker said Shannon's
death was contributed to by neglect.

Shannon's parents Wayne and Simone Powell, pictured leaving North London
Coroners Court yesterday, were distraught at hearing of their daughter's 
final moments

Wayne Powell, Shannon's father, tried to read a statement to the court on behalf of her family.

He was overcome with emotion and struggled to get the words out as his eyes welled up and a court clerk had to take over.

The statement said: 'We find it hard to understand why there was such a delay in getting Shannon to hospital and we have been yearning for the truth about what happened in those long hours in Trent Park before Shannon finally reached hospital.

'We would like to thank everyone for attending Shannon's inquest to allow us the chance to learn what happened to our beautiful girl on that fateful day.

'Her love for life was great and she grabbed all opportunities that came her way - she is a much-loved daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin, loyal friend, and losing her has devastated the family and the community.'

Talented runner and swimmer Shannon Powell was a member of Ealing, Southall and Middlesex Athletics Club

Earlier, the inquest heard Shannon was a talented athlete and had seemed 'fine' before the race.

She
was running well but when she failed to cross the finish line members 
of Ealing, Southall and Middlesex Athletics Club, including her coach, 
went to look for her.

Team manager Tracey Gould found her first after spotting a group of people on top of the hill wearing high visibility jackets.

Shannon's last words to her were "sorry" for not finishing the race, the inquest heard.Â 

She told the inquest: 'I thought there was a problem with her stomach or she had twisted her ankle but as I made my way closer I could see there was somebody on the ground. When I got there I could see it was Shannon.

'Her breathing was very fast as if she had just stopped running. When I first got to her she opened her eyes. She said sorry for not finishing the race.'

Miss Gould said she stayed with Shannon, who by this point was slipping in and out of consciousness.

'Obviously something had happened which was very serious,' Miss Gould told the coroner.

'When she opened her eyes they were fixed. Something had happened which worried me at that time because she couldn't focus. She was wide eyed.'

Shannon, a Year 10 pupil at Northwood College in Middlesex, died before she could be taken to hospital. She was three weeks away from her 15th birthday.
