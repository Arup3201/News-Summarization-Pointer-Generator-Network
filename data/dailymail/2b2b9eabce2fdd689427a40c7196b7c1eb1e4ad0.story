A 46-year-old mother of three whose body was pulled from the Saugatuck River in Connecticut last Friday had been struck by a Metro-North train while walking on the tracks.

A duck hunter spotted Annette White, of South Paris, Maine, in the frigid waters. According to authorities, the woman suffered blunt impact injuries to her head, torso and extremities.

Surveillance footage from Metro-North's Saugatuck train station revealed that a westbound train stopped on the Saugatuck River Bridge for about 20 minutes Thursday evening.

Tragic: Annette White, 46, a divorced mother of three, has been identified as the woman whose body was discovered floating in the Saugatuck River in Westport, Connecticut, last Friday

Fatal move: Police believe White, who was new to the area, was trying to cross the Saugatuck River Bridge by going across the tracks when she was killed

In the video, Metro-North personnel emerged from the locomotive, inspected the front of the lead car and searched the tracks, but continued on their way after failing to find any signs of a deadly collision with a pedestrian, CBS Connecticut reported. 

On Monday, police divers acting on a tip from a Metro-North passanger found Annette White's cell phone and one of her earrings below the tracks where the train came to a stop.

Investigators believe White, who was new to the area, was trying to cross the Saugatuck River Bridge by walking across the tracks at around 6.45pm Thursday when she was struck by the oncoming westbound train and tumbled into the icy waters below.

At around 9.15am Friday, a hunter in a kayak came across the woman's body near the Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club in Westport and alerted the authorities.  

Emergency stop: Surveillance footage from the Saugatuck station showed that a westbound train stopped for 20 minutes and Metro-North personnel inspected the lead car but found no damage to suggest that a person had been struck

Discovery: A police diver found Annette White's cell phone and one of her earrings directly under the train tracks

Closure: A duck hunter in a kayak spotted White's body floating in the frigid waters more than 12 hours after she was struck by the train

An autopsy revealed that White's injuries were consistent with someone being hit by a train.

Police believe the woman's death was accidental and did not involve any foul play. However, they have yet to determine why White ended up on the bridge the night of her death. 

The 46-year-old woman, a Maine native, had lived in Iowa with her husband and three children for more than two decades and taught psychology at Iowa Western Community College. The couple divorced 18 months ago and White moved back to her home state.

According to her Facebook page, White began dating another man last year, and in July 2013 she reportedly relocated to Westport, Connecticut.

White's former sister-in-law Suzanne Jankiewicz Mortensen said that the woman was a great mother and an intelligent, warm person. 

â€˜Why was she on the tracks and didn't she hear the train coming at her?â€™ Jankiewicz Mortensen wondered in her interview with Connecticut Post.

Metro-North officials have concluded that the engineer aboard the train that struck White had acted properly.
