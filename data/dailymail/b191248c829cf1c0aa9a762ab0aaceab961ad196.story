Jailed: Rapist Ashad Arif, 28, has been sentenced to life in prison for raping a teenager just six years after being jailed for an identical crime

A convicted rapist who was freed from prison and went on to carry out an identical attack on a teenager within three years has been jailed for life.

Arshad Arif was considered to be at a high risk of re-offending when he was released from prison after serving five years for his first rape attack and was regularly visited by police.

Within three years of his release and just a week after a police officer's quarterly visits he carried out his second rape on a teenage girl.

A Judge today branded Arif dangerous and
told him that he would have to serve a minimum of six-and-a-half years 
behind bars before he could be considered for release.

Reading Crown Court heard his 17-year-old victim was trying to make her way home after losing her handbag on a night out when 28-year-old Arif let her use his mobile phone to contact her family before offering her a lift in a taxi.

But instead of taking her home, Arif took her to a muddy park 25 miles away where he raped her twice.

The girl managed to escape and her attacker was tracked down by police by the mobile phone he had let the girl use before the attack.

Judge Zoe Smith said: 'In November last year the girl was 17-years-of-age and particularly petite.

'On November 25 she had gone to a club with friends for one of their birthdays where she became confused by alcohol and became separated from her friends.

'At about 2am she found herself outside the club without her bag, without her coat or phone and she found herself unable to return inside.

'Mr Arif had gone to Watford on that night to hang about the clubs there.

'At about 2.50am you saw the girl as you walked past the club. She was standing outside and you approached her.

'You allowed her to use your phone and offered to take her home by taxi although she had just used your phone to call her mother.

'You could be seen on CCTV part carrying her part dragging her away from the club.

'On arrival in Slough you half carried her, half dragged her into Salt Hill Park.'

The court heard Arif then twice raped her in the park.

The girl eventually escaped, jumped over a wall at a nearby house and hammered on the door to raise the alarm.

Arif was identified after police traced the number the schoolgirl had used to phone her parents to the defendant.

Forensic tests on a swab taken from the girl also revealed the presence of semen, which a DNA test showed was Arifâ€™s.

Jury members heard that in 2004 Arif had approached another drunken 17-year-old in the early morning, under the pretence of taking her home, and raped her in a flat.

He admitted rape on the basis that sex was initially consensual and in 2006 was sentenced to five years in jail.

Judge Smith said: 'I have come to the conclusion, even taking into account the basis of plea in the earlier matter, that you pose a high risk of serious harm to the public by committing further offences in the future and have reached the conclusion that the sentence must be imprisonment for life.'

Arif, from Slough, Berkshire, showed no emotion as he was led to the cells.

His young victim, who the court heard now suffered with nightmares and insomnia as a result of the attack, was not in court to see him jailed.
