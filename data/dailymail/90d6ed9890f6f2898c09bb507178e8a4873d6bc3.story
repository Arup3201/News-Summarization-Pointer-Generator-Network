Two men have been charged with the murder of an of a newlywed police officer who was attacked while on his Christmas night out in Liverpool.

Pc Neil Doyle, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was set upon in the early hours of Friday morning in what his boss described as an unprovoked and vicious attack. 

Andrew Taylor, 28, from Huyton, Liverpool, and Christopher Spendlove, 30, of Stockbridge Village, Liverpool, will appear at Liverpool Crown Court tomorrow.

Both defendants have also each been charged with two counts of Section 18 assault, said Merseyside Police.

Police said previously that it appeared that the attackers knew that their victims were off-duty police officers. 

Mr Doyle married only five months ago and he and wife Sarah, 37, had booked a belated honeymoon for the new year. 

Mrs Doyle said in a statement: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all.

'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.'

The couple were married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month.

Speaking last week, Sir Jon Murphy, Merseyside's Chief Constable, said: 'Constable Doyle was enjoying a Christmas night out with his work colleagues.

'They were subjected to an apparently unprovoked and vicious attack by a group of males. There is no indication whatsoever that they were involved in any kind of argument or altercation earlier in the evening.

'The officer I have spoken to has indicated that the individuals who approached them referred to them as police officers. 

Investigation: The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am following the officers' Christmas party at a pub. Above, officers at the scene on Friday

'They then assaulted the officers, leaving two with nasty head injuries and resulting in the tragic death of Neil.'

The attackers vanished when it became clear that Mr Doyle was seriously hurt.

Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived. 

A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. 

Sir Jon said the constable was a patrol officer who had served with the force for ten years.

He had won a commendation for arresting three violent robbers.

The Chief Constable said it was a 'sad day' for Merseyside police and sent his 'heartfelt condolences' to Mrs Doyle and the officer's family. 

Speaking after his death, one neighbour, Margaret Murphy, 61, said: 'It's such a shock. Neil was a lovely lad, very quiet and unassuming. I can't get over it. I saw his wife and brother this morning, they were very upset.

'They told me Neil had passed away after an incident in town. It's so terrible, especially so close to Christmas.'

Another neighbour, Theresa Doyle, who is no relation, added: 'Neil was a lovely neighbour, very polite.

'He wasn't the type to get into trouble – if anything I would guess he had stepped in and tried to solve a problem. He was a really good character. They kept their lives very private. To be honest you would never have known he was a police officer.

'I just feel for Sarah now, and how she copes without him. It is such a shame. It is such sad news.'
