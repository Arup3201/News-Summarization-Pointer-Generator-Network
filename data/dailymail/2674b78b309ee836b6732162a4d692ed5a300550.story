Piloting a 256-foot long vessel must be difficult, but the crew maneuvering Steve Jobs' super-yacht through through a narrow draw-bridge in the Caribbean make it look easy on the aerial footage of the feat.

Drone videographer Brian Muston recorded the $120million vessel passing through the 56-foot opening in the Simpson Bay bridge en route to open waters in Sint Maarten.  

Jobs commissioned Venus in 2008 after spending several summers on the yacht owned by  Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle and a friend of Jobs.

Approach: The 39-foot wide Venus was seen leaving the Simpson Bay Lagoon, with a 56-foot wide bridge opening leaving about 8 feet on either side for an exit

Drone footage: Videographer Brian Muston taped Venus using a drone and uploaded the footage to YouTube 

But work on Venus wasn't completed until 2012, a year after Jobs passed away following a struggle with pancreatic cancer.

Phillippe Starck helped design the sleek 256-foot long vessel, and Jobs enlisted the chief engineer of the Apple Stores to design reinforced glass for its walls, according to his biographer Walter Isaacson.

Starck spoke about Venus in an interview with French Vanity Fair, explaining the yacht houses six bedrooms along with communication systems between the kids' rooms in the front and the adult quarters in the rear.

'Steve wanted to be sure that the teenagers could be set up in the front of the boat when he was at the back and vice-versa. He was obsessed with silence,' Starck said. 

'In his home, children did not make noise, nor the dog, nor his wife … no one made any noise, ever.' 

Jobs' widow Laurene Powell Jobs currently owns the ship, which has been seen in Montanegro, Palma, Gibraltar and Horta Azores according to Shipspotting.com.

The ship was recently underway west of Saba, another Dutch island in the Caribbean, according to Marine Traffic.

There may be a legal scrape in the future for Muston, who was flying the drone less than a kilometer away from the Princess Juliana International Airport SXM in Sint Maarten.

The Daily Herald reports that the airport's director was discussing the issue with the Department of Civil Aviation.

Tight squeeze: Luxury ships pass through the opening frequently, though not all have the celebrity appeal of Jobs' vessel

Easy does it: Sint Maarten hosts a number of large vessels in the Simpson Bay Lagoon, which come and go through one of two bridge openings

Slipping away: Once the crew guided Venus through the opening it passed through Simpson Bay and into open waters

Photos of the interior show a bridge that looks like an Apple store, with at least seven iMacs set up for navigation

Like a villain: The Instagram user behind woodsholeinn captained photos of the yacht by saying he'd happily become a Bond villain

Aficionado: Ship spotting enthusiasts have sighted the vessel in Montanegro, Palma, Gibraltar and Horta Azores

Passed on: Jobs left the yacht to his wife, Laurene Powell, after his death, which Jobs had hoped would not come before the ship could be finished
