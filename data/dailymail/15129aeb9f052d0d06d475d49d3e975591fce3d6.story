Guilty: Renee Marie King was convicted of  murder, child abuse and criminal sexual conduct for the death of her two-year-old stepdaughter Lily Furneau-Wolfenbarger

A woman has been convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting her two-year-old stepdaughter because she threw a temper tantrum and soiled her pants.

It took jurors just two hours to find Renee King, 28, of Macomb County, Michigan, guilty of murder, criminal sexual conduct and child abuse in the November 2010 death of Lily Furneaux-Wolfenbarger.

Members of the toddler's family cried with grief as the verdict was read out.

Lily's mother Lauren Furneaux 
said that though King would not be able to hurt any more children, 'it 
still doesn't bring Lily back'.

The two-year-old was murdered in her father's trailer park home in New Haven when King was left to look after her.

Jeffrey Wolfenbarger, 29, who is married to King, was at work at the time. He and Ms Furneaux had joint custody of the child.

During the trial the prosecution argued that Lily was killed simply because she acted like a normal toddler.

Assistant Prosecutor Therese Tobin said: 'The price...Lily paid with her life 
was because she was acting like a two-year-old that day.

'This defendant wanted to hurt Lily. Lily was acting up, and this is how
 she chose to hurt her.'

Lily's autopsy showed the 20 injuries to the child's head were consistent with having it slammed into the floor over and over again, the same trauma someone would experience in a car crash.

The injuries to her genitals, were comparable to what a woman would experience giving birth, the court heard.

Horrific: Lily's injuries were said to be consistent with having her head slammed into the floor again and again and her genitals like that a woman experiences in child birth

Mother: Lauren Furneaux said of her daughter's death, 'I fought with everything I had and I failed as a mother, I just want to hold her again'

Prosecutors said an object was used to rape the toddler, though exactly what kind of object was not revealed.

The
 defense argued that Lily suffered from a medical condition that caused 
her to fall, and that she fell again while King was trying to revive 
her.

Defense attorney Jason
 Malkiewicz argued that King loved the daughter like she were her own, 
according to the Detroit Free Press.

He said considering the gravity of charges, deliberations should have taken longer.

'They didn't even ask to see one single exhibit. Shocked is all I can say.'

When she was arrested, King told police and relatives that she dropped the two-year-old while in the shower, but investigators said there was evidence found at the home that did not support this.

Prison: Renee King cried when the jury delivered their verdict after only two hours. She will be sentenced on April 10

The two-year-old's father, Jeffrey Wolfenbarger, faces charges of aggravated assault and disturbing the peace after knocking a 
woman over while attempting to attack someone outside court on February 17.

It was related to proceedings which took place in the court that day.

King will be sentenced on April 10. She has three children of her own from other relationships.

Lauren Furneaux told the Free Press she wishes there was more she could have done to save her daughter.

Ms Furneaux said: 'I fought with everything I had, and I 
failed as a mother. ... I just want to hold her again.'
