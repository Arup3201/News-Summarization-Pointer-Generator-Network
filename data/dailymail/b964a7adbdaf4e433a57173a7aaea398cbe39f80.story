Swingers are set to descend on the Brecon Beacons for a cowboy themed sex party, much to the disgust of disgruntled locals.

More than 100 have signed up for the two-day event on July 4 and 5 at the secluded four-star Clyngwyn bunkhouse, in the Beacons National Park.

The weekend, in the shadow of Ystradfellte waterfalls, is being set up by a couple claiming to be called 'Fire and Ice', also known as Ally and Steve.

They have been plugging the £20 nights at the secluded hostel on a swingers website.

'We have been on the scene for a while but are by no means hardened swingers,' the couple wrote.

'We enjoy the social side just as much as anything else.'

Swingers from all over Wales have been discussing their party outfits on the website fabswingers.com.

'MissMaverick', from Swansea, promised to bring some order to the party by dressing as a Sheriff.

'Sounds like you guys need a sheriff to oversee matters,' she said. 'Luckily for you, I know one.'

One woman, who lives nearby, said she was 'disgusted'.

'It is despicable that people should parade their sexual escapades in the open.

'The venue is easily accessible to all kinds of hikers even children, and indeed the venue is used as a hiking hostel for youths on occasion,' she said.

The resident claimed the event was being attended by professionals from schoolteachers to social workers.

'I for one wouldn't appreciate my children or indeed any family member depending on people that saw public sex displays as a hobby,' she said.

She claims the group have hired a photographer to record the event.

'He is photographing the naked jelly and custard wrestling and selling the photographs,' she added.

Glynneath councillor Eddie Jones welcomed the tourists.

Glynneath councillor Eddie Jones has welcomed the tourists, adding that: 'Anything that brings people to my area is to be welcomed'

He said: 'Anything that brings people to my area is to be welcomed. I wouldn't want them running down the middle of the street doing anything, amusing as that might be.

'But each to their own I suppose. I'm not a prude by any means.'

The four-star Clyngwyn bunkhouse, in the Beacons National Park, has 19 beds and camping facilities on its three acres of land.

Its website states: 'Clyngwyn's range of accommodation open all year round allows us to cater for a wide range of group holidays, family holidays, schools, parties, reunions and weddings/civil partnerships.

'We aim to provide a friendly and laid-back atmosphere for you to feel at ease.'

Owner Julie Hurst said: 'I just rent my bunkhouse out, I don't know what they are doing. You would need to speak to the organisers.'
