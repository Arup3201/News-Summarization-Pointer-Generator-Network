The close links between Google and the upper echelons of the Conservative Party were on public display this weekend at a society wedding attended by David Cameron.

The Prime Minister and his wife Samantha were guests at the marriage of Naomi Gummer, a senior Google executive.

She was a political adviser to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt – whose brief includes internet regulation – before moving to the web giant where she is now a public policy analyst.

Miss Gummer, 27, married the Duchess of Cornwall’s godson Henry Allsopp, 38, heir to the 6th Baron Hindlip, in Chadlington, Oxfordshire.

The duchess also attended the ceremony as did Mr Allsopp’s sister Kirstie, the TV presenter.

Embattled Mr Hunt was there with his wife Lucia and their two young children. He has faced repeated calls to resign over his links to News International and faces a crunch session before the Leveson Inquiry this week.

He wore a morning suit, like most of the male guests, while the Prime Minister opted for a less formal blue lounge suit. Mrs Cameron wore a Peter Pilotto dress.

Miss Gummer is the daughter of PR guru Lord Chadlington. His country estate borders the Camerons’ in Oxfordshire, and is president of the Prime Minister’s Witney constituency party.

Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha, attended the ceremony with their 21-month-old daughter Florence, in what looks set to be a testing week for the relationship between the Prime Minister and his Culture Secretary.

Both men were pictured with their families at the marriage ceremony in Chadlington, Oxfordshire.

Despite the public show of unity between the men, however, it is believed the Prime Minister is preparing contingency plans for Mr Hunt leaving the cabinet.

It is thought the Culture Secretary could take time out from his role in the autumn after it emerged his department is in a state of paralysis following the revelations at the Leveson Inquiry.

A senior Government source, speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, said the Department was 'barely functioning':

'The DCMS is in a state of suspended animation at the moment and this obviously has an effect on the Olympics.

'I think Jeremy could well decide to take some time out after the Games.

'He would say he has done nothing wrong and has nothing to hide, but he needs to recharge his batteries for a while.'

The Prime Minister, who has also been damaged by the revelations, is likely to be tested further by Hunt's evidence at the Inquiry this Thursday.

It is expected that Mr Hunt's argument that he acted properly in his quasi-judicial role overseeing the News Corp bid will come under intense questioning.

For now, however, Mr Hunt looked relaxed as he was pictured at the wedding with his family.

A number of other high-profile guests, including the Duchess of Cornwall, who is Henry's godmother, were also at the Oxfordshire ceremony.

Camilla, who was not accompanied by the Prince at Wales, wore a white summer dress with matching headwear to the wedding.

Art dealer Allsopp was previously in a relationship with the widow of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain. Allsop and Gummer announced their engagement last December.

The pair had grown up in the same street in Kensington, west London but only met four years ago on a Caribbean island, before starting dating each other last summer.

One guest at the wedding ceremony, which took place in brilliant sunshine, described the pair as 'blissfully happy'.

At the high-society wedding, nearly every male guest - including the beleaguered Culture Secretary - chose to wear the traditional morning dress, making David Cameron's decision to wear a lounge suit all the more surprising.

Samantha Cameron appeared to also upstage her husband by appearing in a bright summery Peter Pilotto dress at the Oxfordshire ceremony.
