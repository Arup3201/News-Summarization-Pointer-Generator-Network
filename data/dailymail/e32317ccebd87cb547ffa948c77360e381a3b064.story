Manchester United coach Louis van Gaal has dismissed Cesc Fabregas and Toni Kroos from the club's list of targets for this summer.

The Dutchman has, however, been linked with Bayern Munich talisman Bastian Schweinsteiger and the word out of Munich is that Pep Guardiola would be willing to listen to offers of £10million for the 29-year-old midfielder.

Schweinsteiger, whose name cropped up during David Moyes's tenure at United, is also interested in a new challenge.

Has his own ideas: Louis van Gaal has identified a number of different targets for when he takes over

On the hunt: Bastian Schweinsteiger could be available for £10m and Van Gaal is interested in the midfielder

The old regime had concerns about his fitness and value for money, given that he earns £8m a year but Van Gaal worked with the Germany star at Bayern nnd knows him better than most.

Also in Van Gaal's thinking is the Dutch contingent of Feyenoord right back Daryl Janmaat, centre back Bruno Martins Indi and the versatile Ajax defender Daley Blind.

A deal for Roma's Kevin Strootman remains on the cards once he proves he is recuperating well from his knee ligament injury.

Meanwhile, Danny Welbeck has admitted to becoming frustrated by his failure to hold down a first-team place up front for United.

The England forward wants a central role for club and country to prove he can score goals regularly at the highest level.

Play me through the middle! Danny Welbeck has admitted his frustration at Old Trafford last season

Welbeck has scored eight times in 21 
appearances for the national team but spent most of the season 
struggling for form at United under David Moyes.

‘It
 does get frustrating,’ said the 23-year-old. ‘You want to be playing in
 a certain position and you’re not getting the opportunity to do that.

‘For
 United I’m more likely to be left wing of a four-man midfield with only
 two centre midfielders so it’s a bit more difficult for me to make runs to 
score when I’ve got to think about my defensive duties as well.'
