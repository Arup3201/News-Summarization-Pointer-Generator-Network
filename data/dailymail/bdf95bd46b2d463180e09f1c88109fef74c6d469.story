Power base: Lucy Baldwin, 29, who has rapidly risen to the rank of managing director at Goldman Sachs

Their names may still be relatively unknown - but these are the potential billionaires-to-be who are expected to shape the world's affairs for decades to come.

While most people quietly grow older, these individuals have are quickly amassing vast power bases - and they are all aged under 30.

Forbes magazine - a respected American business publication - has put together 15 lists of 30 young leading lights who are seen as the names to watch out for in 2014.

The list includes Amir Taaki, the 
25-year-old associated with Dark Wallet, which is an online service that
 allows people to trade Bitcoins anonymously.

Also on the power list is Pete Cashmore, the Aberdeen-born founder of the website Mashable.

Lucy
 Baldwin, 29, a London-based Goldman Sachs managing director was also 
named. She has risen rapidly through the ranks at the banks after 
graduating from Birmingham University in economics in 2004.

Evan
 Spiegel, the co-founder of Snapchat, would have been a billionaire 
already if he had accepted a $3billion offer from Facebook for his app.

Not
 all the 450 names on the Forbes magazine 30 under 30 lists will join 
the realms of the super-rich - and many of them may not want to.

One of the youngest names of all on 
the list is 16-year-old Malala Yousafzai who became known around the 
world after being shot by the Taliban.Â

The 15 lists cover everything from business to technology, music and sport.

Although American names dominate on the lists put together by the U.S. magazine, a handful of Brits have been included.

One
 Direction are on the list of top music stars, while Andy Murray, who 
last year became the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles 
title in 77 years, is on the sport list.

A list of the prodigies - all born after 1983 - is put together annually by the twice-weekly New York based magazine.

The 25-year-old London-born software developer is behind Dark Wallet, a service which will allow people to trade the virtual currency Bitcoin anonymously.

Expelled from school for hacking, Mr Taaki has promoted free computer software and advocates total data freedom.

An establishment outsider, Dark Wallet will enable people to trade Bitcoins anonymously - and therefore evade detection by governments around the world.

He has worked alongside Cody Wilson on the app which will be totally free to use.

London-based boyband One Direction make it onto Forbes list of the top 30 under 30 music stars.

The
 band signed up with Simon Cowel's record label in 2010 after appearing 
on the X-Factor and have followed up success in the UK with three US 
number one albums.

Zayn 
Malik, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Niall Horan wil be 
some of the best known names on the hot list of under 30 stars.

Few Goldman Sachs employees ever make it to the rank of managing director - and even less in their youth.

But London-based Lucy Baldwin is already in charge of the bank's European research management team - despite being aged just 29.

She made her debut on the Forbes 30 under 30 list in 2012 and is leading the 21st century charge of women in the corporate world.

She was previously in charge of the bank's retail and consumer equity research.

Scottish businessman Pete Cashmore - who still lives with his parents - founded the popular news and technology website Mashable when he was aged just 19.

Now 27, the entrepreneur - dubbed the 'planet's sexiest geek' - splits his time between his native Scotland and New York.

Now employing more than 120 people, Mashable covers and aggregates a wide range of news related to the fast-evolving social media and Internet sector covering companies ranging from start-ups to larger players including Facebook and Twitter and has in excess of 50 million page views a month.

The company have offices in New York and San Francisco - and soon Los Angeles and London as well.

Andy Murray emulated Great Briton Fred Perry last year and became the first British male to win the Wimbledon men's singles titles in 77 years.

His victory came less than a year after he won his first grand slam event in New York at the US Open.

The notoriously shy Scot, who grew up in Dunblane, would no doubt be surprised to appear on a list of the biggest young global names. However, he makes the sport list.
