Lashing out: Neil Whittaker-Axon, 39, repeatedly punched a 65-year-old cyclist who had complained about being 'cut up'

A bus driver jumped 80 feet to his death from a bridge following a road rage attack on a grandfather.

Neil Whittaker-Axon, 39, had been fired after repeatedly punching a 65-year-old cyclist who complained about being 'cut up' in Manchester city centre.

The father of two said he had 'embarrassed his family' by losing his job at bus firm Finglands.

Although he found other work, he had a mental breakdown and became paranoid, claiming that someone had given him a pie which was poisoned and that he was being watched by police and social services.

After telling a psychiatrist he had three choices - going to hospital, getting shot in the head or killing himself, Mr Whittaker-Axon plunged from the top of an aqueduct near Stockport, Greater Manchester.

A post mortem examination revealed he had died from head injuries, which are believed to have been caused by his impact with the water.

An inquest in Stockport was told that Mr Whittaker-Axon, from Manchester, had been married with two children, but his relationship ended in 2004 after he struggled with being a parent.

His former wife Jessica told the hearing: 'He always kept himself busy and liked keeping fit by mountain biking. He struggled about being a father. He wanted to live a free life.

'During the latter stages of the marriage, I felt like he was drinking a lot. I mentioned it to him but he refused to admit that he had a drink problem.'

In November 2011, Mr Whittaker-Axon was convicted of common assault at Manchester Magistrates' Court.

No details of the assault were given at the inquest, but retired joiner Harry Clare told the trial he had been cycling through the city centre when the double-decker driven by Mr Whittaker-Axon forced him on to the pavement.

The grandfather followed the vehicle to Manchester Piccadilly bus station and went up to the driver's window, thinking he might get an apology.

But Mr Whittaker-Axon leaned out and began hitting him, then lifting him off the ground by his collar and smashing his sunglasses.

At the time, Mr Clare told the court: 'I thought the guy might have apologised to me and I followed him there to say, "what on earth is the problem?". His body language said he wasn't going to shake my hand. I heard the window slam.

'He reached out and grabbed me by the back of the collar of my clothing. He yanked me to the side of the bus. I felt my head banging against something and something banging against my helmet.'

Mr Whittaker-Axon insisted he was defending himself but was fined £150 and ordered to pay £100 costs and £175 compensation to the cyclist.

Last June, he was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital under the Mental Health Act after calling police the previous night, talking about being kidnapped.

He told officers he believed he had been under surveillance and that his mobile and iPad had been hacked.

Neighbours complained of him running around in the street wearing only his trousers and police tracked him down at an industrial estate in Stockport.

Consultant psychologist Dr Aman Gupta, who treated Mr Whittaker-Axon, said he was 'very paranoid' and had complained about hearing voices.

'Psychotic episode': The father of two was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital in June after calling the police, talking about being kidnapped. A month later, he jumped off the aqueduct and died

Dr Gupta said: 'He said somebody had given him a pie which was poisoned, his toothpaste was poisoned, he was being watched by the police and social services.

'He complained of having embarrassed his family.

'He said he had three choices - going to hospital, getting shot in the head or killing himself.'

On July 11, Mr Whittaker-Axon was spotted jumping from the aqueduct into the water, leaving behind a black rucksack, brown jacket and silver keys.

Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'We know he had a period as an in-patient for what appeared to be a psychotic episode. Having heard the evidence, it leads me to conclude that he has taken his own life.'

An earlier version of this article suggested that Mr Whittaker-Axon took his life as a result of being fired from his position at Finglands bus firm.  We are happy to clarify that this was not the case and that there were other contributing factors.
