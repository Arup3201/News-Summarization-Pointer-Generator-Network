Padding such a long way back was a tall order for a little lapdog with stumpy legs.

So when Alfie the Yorkshire terrier was dumped by thieves 120 miles from his home, he found a novel way to bring about a snappy rescue.

With great presence of mind – or luck – he dashed into a deserted country lane just as an RSPCA van drove by.

The near-miss, plus a lot of barking, made RSPCA inspector Stephanie Law pull over.

When she opened her cab door, Alfie bounded in and started licking her face appreciatively.

Because the seven-year-old was microchipped, RSPCA staff were able to trace his owner, Kirsty Mitton, in Wednesbury, West Midlands – the opposite end of the M40 from where he was found in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.

Inquiries revealed Alfie had been missing for 12 days after being stolen with Miss Mitton’s other Yorkshire terrier, Lillie, during a raid on her home.

Miss Mitton, 23, put up 400 posters near her home and launched an appeal on Facebook to find the dogs after the burglary on March 21.

Yesterday, Inspector Law said: ‘I was just driving down the deserted road when I saw Alfie run towards me, clearly trying to attract my attention. He ran right in front of the van, barking, and as soon as I stopped and opened the door he just bounded in and jumped on the seat.

‘It was as if he recognised my uniform and knew I was there to rescue him.

‘I have had plenty of people wave me down for help but I have never actually been flagged down by a dog in need of rescue before.’

Miss Mitton, who runs her family’s haulage firm, has had Alfie since he was a puppy. Lillie, five, is not microchipped and is still missing.

The pets are thought to have been stolen by dognappers who cash in on the lucrative trade in Yorkshire terrier puppies, which can sell for £900. They have become increasingly popular after being photographed with celebrity owners such as Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.

The two dogs were the only things taken in the break-in. It is thought Alfie was dumped by the thieves when they realised he is neutered. Lillie has not been spayed so can still breed.

Miss Mitton, said: ‘It was like he just flagged her down and knew who she was. It is incredible that he rescued himself like that.’ 

Anyone with information about missing Lillie should call the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018
