An ancient carnivorous reptile with teeth shaped like steak knives has been named.

Nundasuchus roamed the Earth 240 million years ago and had bony plates on its back like a crocodile, with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur.

The skeleton, which has taken more than 1,000 hours to reconstruct, may help experts to fill in gaps in the ancient reptile family tree.

What a find! Palaeontologists have discovered an ancient carnivorous reptile with teeth shaped like steak knives. Nundasuchus roamed the Earth 240 million years ago and was heavy-bodied with limbs under its body like a dinosaur. An illustration of the 9 ft (3 metre) reptile is shown

The nine foot (three-metre) reptile was one of the larger reptiles that lived before dinosaurs roamed the planet.

‘The full name is actually Nundasuchus songeaensis,' Sterling Nesbitt, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Virginia Tech explained.

The name means ‘predator crocodile’ with ‘unda’ meaning predator in Swahili and ‘suchus’ a reference to a crocodile in Greek. 

A distant relative? The ancient reptile had bony plates on its back like a crocodile (a stock image is shown) with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur. Its name means ‘predator crocodile’ with ‘unda’ meaning predator in Swahili and ‘suchus’ a reference to a crocodile in Greek

Name: Nundasuchus songeaensis

Meaning: Predator crocodile, with 'unda' meaning predator in Swahili and 'suchus' a reference to a crocodile in Greece. 

The later part comes from the town, Songea, where the bones were found.

Age: The reptile lived 140 million years ago

Distinctive features: It had bony plates on its back like a crocodile, with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur, as well as teeth that have been likened to steak knives.

Skeleton location: It was found in Songea, south west Tanzania.

Importance: The bones may help experts to fill in gaps in the ancient reptile family tree.

'The "songeaensis" comes from the town, Songea, near where we found the bones,' Professor Nesbitt said.

‘The reptile itself was heavy-bodied with limbs under its body like a dinosaur, or bird, but with bony plates on its back like a crocodilian.’

The 32-year-old academic has discovered seven reptiles and dinosaurs in the past decade, and was involved in naming 17.

He discovered the partial skeleton in 2007 when he was a student but it has taken years to piece the bones together, which were in thousands of pieces.

While a large number of skeleton bones were found, most of the skull was not recovered.

Nundasuchus was discovered close to a town in southwestern Tanzania while Professor Nesbitt and a team of researchers were looking for prehistoric relatives of birds and crocodiles.

‘There's such a huge gap in our understanding around the time when the common ancestor of birds and crocodilians was alive - there isn't a lot out there in the fossil record from that part of the reptile family tree,’ he said.

‘This helps us fill in some gaps in reptile family tree, but we're still studying it and figuring out the implications.’

The bones were collected in Songea, southwestern Tanzania (shown on the map) in 2007. Its skeleton was found in thousands of pieces and took more than 1,000 hours to reconstruct

Professor Nesbitt said that he realised very quickly what he had found.

‘Sometimes you know instantly if it's new and within about 30 seconds of picking up this bone I knew it was a new species.

‘I had hoped to find a leg bone to identify it, and I thought, “this is exactly why we're here” and I looked down and there were bones everywhere.

‘It turns out I was standing on bones that had been weathering out of the rock for hundreds of years - and it was all one individual of a new species.’

The reptile was recorded in the Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology.

Prehistoric crocodiles were able to run around like dogs to escape the jaws of predatory dinosaurs.

This is according to a study published last year that showed, for the first time, how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world.

Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish, but their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales.

Today, most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish. But their ancestors (pictuerd) were very different creatures, with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales

The study, by Bristol University, revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments.

The team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the Mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years.

The study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the Jurassic seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey, such as fish.

The research also found that variation peaked again in the Cretaceous period- 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food.

After the devastating end-Triassic extinction event, crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish.

They also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the Cretaceous Period - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs, including eating plants.

Surprisingly, the lower jaws of Cretaceous crocodiles did not have a huge amount of variation.

Instead, the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy, such as armadillo-like body armour.
