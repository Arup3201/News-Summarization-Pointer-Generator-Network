A five-year-old girl who recovered from a brain tumour was forced to clean up her own urine in front of her classmates after wetting herself.

Liberty Rose Finn underwent nine grueling months of chemotherapy to overcome cancer.

But the illness left her with disabilities which often result in her wetting herself.

Brave: Liberty Rose Finn recovered from cancer but the illness results in her occasionally wetting herself. Her mother Dawn is furious after her daughter was forced to clean up her own urine after wetting herself at school

After an accident in the classroom at Church Gresley Infant and Nursery School, in Swadlincote, south Derbyshire, the youngster was forced to clean up her own mess in front of her classmates.

A teacher then ordered her to stand facing a wall for 10 minutes.

It left her parents Carl and Dawn Finn furious.

Initially they kept quiet about the incident while the school conducted an investigation.

But the couple decided to break their silence after receiving a letter from the school which said it had ‘fully investigated’ the incident and the ‘matter had been dealt with’.

It also said appropriate action had been taken and the member of staff concerned ‘deeply regrets what has happened’.

The family, from Castle Gresley Swadlincote, have now hit back over the way the incident was handled.

Little fighter: Liberty in hospital suffering from cancer at just nine months old

Furious: Liberty's parents are unhappy with the way their daughter's school handled their complaint

Mr Finn said: 'We strongly feel that the school, the board of governors and the education authority are trying to quietly sweep the matter under the carpet.

'The teacher wasn’t suspended while the investigation was carried out.

'We have been told the governors have looked into the matter and they reassure us that our child’s welfare is of paramount importance and that appropriate action has been taken. However, they have not told us what the action was.

'My wife and I have watched our daughter bravely battle cancer. We have seen her inspire thousands and thousands of people.

'We will not see her humiliated in public. We cannot let this matter go with just a warning.'

Liberty was eight months old when she was diagnosed with optic chaism glioma - a tumour around her optical nerve which meant it could never be operated on due to its size and location.

However, after nine months of chemotherapy, the tumour vanished, making Liberty the first person on record to beat such a tumour.

Mr and Mrs Finn said they were horrified as their daughter and her twin sister, Destiny, told them what had happened.

Mr Finn added: 'My daughter has been left with special needs after bravely fighting a brain tumour and was subjected to what I can only describe as an act of public humiliation.

'Liberty Rose was made to clean her own urine off the classroom floor and made to do this while still in her soiled clothes.'

Her parents are now appealing against the decision by the board of governors and have contacted Derbyshire County Council.

However, a spokesman for the education authority said: 'We are not going to investigate the matter.

'We have spoken to the acting head teacher, and the school has apologised to the parents and has taken action to make sure it doesn’t happen again.'

The teacher involved has been the subject of criticism on the social network site Facebook.
