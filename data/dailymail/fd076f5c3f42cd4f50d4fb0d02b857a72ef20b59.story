Britain has dodged a triple-dip recession and is finally on the road to recovery, a leading international watchdog declared today.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said the UK economy grew at an annual rate of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2013.

That is the equivalent of just over 0.1 per cent on a quarterly basis and enough to avoid another recession following the 0.3 per cent slump in the final three months of 2012.

Figures published by the Office for National Statistics confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012

Pier Carlo Padoan, deputy general secretary of the OECD and its chief economist, said the situation 'is still fragile' but 'improvements are beginning to be seen'.

The Paris-based think tank said growth would pick up to an annual rate of 1.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year as Britain emerges from the economic doldrums.

It came as official UK figures showed the crucial services sector grew by 0.3 per cent in January - its strongest rate of expansion for five months.

The Office for National Statistics said output in the sector, which makes up three-quarters of the economy and includes pubs, stock brokers and hairdressers, was 0.8 per cent higher than a year earlier.

It bolstered hopes that Britain has avoided a triple-dip recession despite the freezing weather and the crisis in Cyprus. The ONS will publish the official number for the first quarter in late April.

Mr Padoan said: 'The situation [in the UK] is still fragile. I think the policy course, both in terms of monetary and fiscal policy, is going in the right direction and improvements are beginning to be seen.'

While the unemployment rate has fallen, a sign of an improving economy, the depseration of jobseekers was laid bare today when 4,000 people turned out hoping to find work at a new shopping centre.

Long queues started to build two hours before the jobs fair at the Solent Hotel, in Whiteley, Hampshire, got under way, drawing in people from all walks off life clutching CVs and laptops in a bid to make the right impression.

Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The 0.3 per cent rise in services output in January is very good news for hopes that the economy can avoid further contraction in the first quarter of 2013 and dodge a triple dip.

'The odds are swinging towards the 
economy avoiding another GDP fall in the first quarter as long as the 
latest bout of snow does not have a significant distorting impact.' But 
other analysts were less confident.

Alan
 Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said: 'It's a close call but my 
feeling is a triple-dip recession is more likely than not.'

Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said: 'The economy is flatlining. 2013 will probably be a write-off.'

The OECD forecasts will be a welcome boost for Chancellor George Osborne

Britain is trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century and the economy is still more than three per cent smaller than it was before the crisis struck in 2008.

A third recession since then would be a further setback for George Osborne in the wake of last week's gloomy Budget.

The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed in half its growth forecasts for this year to just 0.6 per cent and said the deficit-reduction plan has stalled.

But it predicted growth of 0.1 per cent in the first quarter - indicating that there will be no triple-dip - although the Bank of England has warned the chances of another recession are 50-50.

Britain has already been stripped of its AAA credit rating by international agency Moody's and rival Fitch has warned that the country faces another downgrade by the end of April as the Chancellor struggles to deal with the soaring national debt.

It is feared that another downgrade could sent the pound tumbling and drive up borrowing costs for the government, businesses and households.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: 'Stronger growth in the services sector at the start of the year has greatly reduced the risk of the UK falling back into a triple-dip recession.

'The country is not out of the woods yet, with much depending on how the economy has coped with adverse weather conditions in recent months, and the indications are that any growth is still disappointingly weak.

'Even if the political embarrassment of a triple-dip recession is avoided, the underlying weakness of the economy still has the potential to trigger further credit rating downgrades, putting selling pressure on gilts and sterling.'
