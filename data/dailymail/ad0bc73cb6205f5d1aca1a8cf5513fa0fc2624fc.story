Chelsea have suffered a blow in their pursuit of Palermo's Paulo Dybala after the striker declared he 'would love to stay in Serie A'.  

The 21 year old has scored 13 league this season and has also attracted interest from the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid. 

But reports in Italy suggest that Juventus have offered £23million for Dybala, who admitted he would love to play alongside Andrea Pirlo and does not 'speak a word of English or French'.

'I love Italy. This is the country that made me famous and I would love to stay in Serie A,' he said.

'There are some big teams out there who don't play in Champions League and I can't deny that I'd love to play in Europe's most prestigious competition.

'It's a lot easier for a striker when you have a playmaker like Pirlo behind you,' he added. 'He makes even the most difficult things look easy.'
