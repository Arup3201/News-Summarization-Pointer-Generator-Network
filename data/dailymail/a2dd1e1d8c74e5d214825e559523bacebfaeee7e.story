This is more expensive than Stan, a partnership between Channel Nine and Fairfax, which will cost $10 for TV and movies.

It is also pricier than Netflix, which has yet to release its costings but is expected to also charge around $10 per month.

Presto is a partnership between Channel Seven and Foxtel, and will include selected content from both networks.

On Thursday the company announced its partnership with HBO and Showtime, however series from these studios will only be available on Presto after they have aired on Foxtel.

Most HBO series still in production, including Game Of Thrones, are not included.

On Thursday the company announced its partnership with HBO and Showtime, however series from these studios will only be available on Presto after they have aired on Foxtel (such as HBO show Entourage)

Hit series Girls is on offer, but the show’s fourth season - which began airing on Monday (Australian time) - is not included and will not be added until it has aired on Foxtel.

A Presto spokesman told Daily Mail Australia: 'Presto TV presently won't have the most current series available. This might change down the track and pending other content acquisitions.'

TV shows on offer include The Sopranos, The Wire, The Newsroom, Veep, Dexter and Deadwood.

Presto will work on Windows, Mac, Chromecast and tablets but it is not available as an app for smart TVs.

Customers can buy packages but Presto has yet to release its official launch date.
