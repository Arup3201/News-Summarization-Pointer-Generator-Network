Jailed: Family doctor Andrew Johnson, 61, was sentenced to 11 years and eight months in prison for sex offences against nine women

Family doctor Andrew Johnson was known for greeting attractive women patients with comments such as ‘eh up sexy’ and ‘hello gorgeous.’

In the privacy of his consulting room his remarks were even more inappropriate, telling one woman who was reluctant to undress ‘I’m a doctor and if I want to look at your boobs and bum I will do so’ and another ‘Oh very nice, you should keep wearing those sort of things’ when he noticed she was in stockings.

But the GP’s over familiarity also crossed the boundaries into sexual assault, a court heard.

Johnson squeezed the breasts of his patients and touched them inappropriately while carrying out examinations for his own sexual gratification, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

A patient with tonsillitis was given a breast examination and another was given an internal check for a chest infection.

Johnson, 61, was convicted of sex offences against nine women patients over a 28-year period and also admitted indecently assaulting the teenage daughter of a family friend away from his surgery.

The father-of-three was jailed for a total of 11 years and eight months.

Passing sentence Judge Simon Lawler told Johnson: ‘They trusted you as their doctor with their bodies. You breached that contract between doctor and patient in the worst possible way.

‘Your sexualised behaviour was something which no-one should have to endure in a consultation with their doctor.’

The judge said he left his victims in a state of shock and praised their courage in giving evidence against him.

Johnson was found guilty of 14 offences of indecent assault and one of sexual assault in April. The case could not be reported for legal reasons until yesterday.

His victims were aged between 16 and 46 and were assaulted in his surgeries at Bawtry, near Doncaster, and Blyth, near Worksop, between 1978 and 2006, when he stopped practising because a complaint was made.

One of the women said she had not come forward until years later because ‘it was my word against his and I didn’t think anyone would believe me.’ The court heard Johnson was struck off ‘in disgrace’ by the General Medical Council in 2010.

He began groping patients almost immediately after taking over the practice from his father.

A 22-year-old woman claimed the GP gave her regular internal examinations although she was suffering from depression.

He quizzed her about her sex life and suggested she buy a sex toy to relieve stress.

Johnson told a 32-year-old woman with stomach pains that she should spice up her sex life by saying ‘no knickers on’ when her husband phoned. He also rubbed and stroked her bottom when he had no reason to, the court heard.

A woman of 30 with chest pains was touched inappropriately and told: ‘I need to know if you orgasm.’

She later went back with sleeplessness and depression. He said she should take a less stressful job like a ‘checkout chick at Tesco.’

Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell, QC, said: ‘It seemed to her that Dr Johnson wanted her to take off her clothes a lot of the time.’

Another patient thought the doctor was ‘a bit of a pervert’ after he made a comment about her having a ‘very nice cervix.’

While a 46-year-old, who had a tan after returning from a holiday in the Seychelles, was touched as if he was ‘trying to stimulate her sexually.’

Johnson said he had no recollection of any of the consultations as they were so long ago and he had 3,000 patients.

The GP admitted he could have touched the women’s private parts accidentally but ‘not as a deliberate act.’ In victim impact statements several of the women told how Johnson’s perverted behaviour had ruined their lives. One woman is now petrified if she has to sit next to men on planes.

Another said: ‘He abused his position as a doctor. I placed my trust in him. He had access to me as a patient, not as a woman. 

'He chose to abuse that trust which will stay with me for the rest of my life.’ A complainant groped as a teenager said Johnson was the first man ‘to place his hands on her in a sexual manner’ and she had ‘lost the right to choose who that person should be.’

Johnson was initially only jailed for five years but his sentence was increased to nine years by the Appeal Court because he had been treated too leniently.

Yesterday the jail term was increased by a further 32 months after he admitted 12 indecent assaults on a girl aged between 14 and 16 at his home and a Christian Fellowship camp during the 1990s.

After the hearing Detective Chief Inspector Steve Whittaker of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘These crimes are inexcusable. 

'He abused his position as a doctor by taking advantage of the trust his patients had given him. In my opinion this is the ultimate betrayal of trust by an extremely manipulative man.’
