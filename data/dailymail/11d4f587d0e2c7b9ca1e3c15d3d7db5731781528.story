QPR boss Chris Ramsey has defended ageing star Rio Ferdinand after the centre back came in for some stick from his own fans during Saturday's defeat to Tottenham. 

The former England international was culpable for both goals, leading to chants from the away end of 'It's time to retire' - something a smattering of home fans joined in with.

Ramsey, however, stuck up for his defender, praising Ferdinand's effort and refusing to blame him for the goals Rangers conceded.

The 36-year-old has not been at his best since joining QPR, and some fans turned on him on Saturday

'I think Rio's applied himself well,' Ramsey said. 'I'm very pleased with the way he played.

'In the position we're in, when goals go in people will always get blamed or people look at some more than others.

'For Rio to be the age he is and applying himself the way he is in training and in games, we need to encourage him.

'It's always disappointing when a goal goes in, and you can always break it down and analyse it to its finest points. The players involved will always be disappointed.'
