The Crown Prince of Dubai fought to spin anti-clockwise to free the twisted parachute cords at 3,000ft

Dubai's skyscrapers and white beaches can be seen beneath him as he forces himself anti-clockwise.

He told Emarat Al Youm: 'In such situations taking a decision can save the jumper, whereas delaying for seconds can lead to ominous results.
