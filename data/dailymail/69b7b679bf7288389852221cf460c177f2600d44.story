As basketball trick shots go, this one was a very tall order – because it involved throwing a ball from a 561ft tower into a hoop below.

But the self-proclaimed ‘Ambassadors of Fun’ at Dude Perfect pulled it off and the YouTube video of the feat has gone viral, with nearly 400,000 views at the time of writing.

Dude Perfect have made dozens of basketball trick videos and their latest involved one of the team, Tyler Toney, throwing a ball from the top of Reunion Tower in Dallas  - appropriately nick-named ‘The Ball’ - into a hoop being carried by Cody Jones and Garrett Hilbert in the car park below.

Toney throws the ball with immense force and it hurtles towards Jones and Hilbert who, with the help of some guidance via walkie-talkies, deftly manoeuvre the hoop into position.

The camera in the tower follows the ball all the way to the bottom, in one shot, and there are whoops of delight when it goes through the net.

Aerial footage taken from the side shows just how strong the throw needed to be for the ball to reach the car park.
