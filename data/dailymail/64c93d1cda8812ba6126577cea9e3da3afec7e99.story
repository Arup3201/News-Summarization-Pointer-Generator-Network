David Moyes has written a letter to Manchester United season-ticket holders admitting he is 'desperate to compensate' for the dismal start to his tenure at the club.

The former Everton manager took the reins from legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson last summer, but has seen the champions’ form take a nose dive as they sit seventh in the Premier League, have been knocked out of the FA Cup and are on the brink of Champions League exit. 

But the United faithful continue to back their manager, despite some shocking performances both at Old Trafford and away from home.

United fans had grown accustomed to success under Ferguson, who won 13 Premier League titles in his 27 years at Old Trafford, and Moyes has informed them that he wants to take the club back to those heights. 

Moyes wrote in his letter, titled A Word From The Boss: ‘While I knew that this job would be a challenge when I took it on, the difficult season we have experienced was not something that I envisaged, which I am sure is the case as well for you supporters – and my players, staff and I am desperate to compensate for that.’

‘Everywhere we turn people outside the club have a lot to say about Manchester United, but we have all stuck together through some tough times this season and I firmly believe that, in the long run, we will all come out at the other end, stronger for the experiences.

‘Everything we need have been through will make us a better, stronger team and club in the future.‘Over the years you have seen great winning sides here and, in time, I have absolutely no doubt that we will see great winning sides here again. 

‘A big step towards that will be transforming Old Trafford back into the fortress it has long been renowned as, and we will do everything in our power to get the positive performances and results to do that, so that we can give you Season Ticket holders and all of our supporters something to shout about.’

To repay the fans, Moyes has promised improvement next season, and wants Old Trafford to become a fortress once again, like it was under Ferguson.

He wrote: ‘You are accustomed to seeing a successful Manchester United and the backing you have given the players and I throughout the season has been incredible. 

‘Away from home the travelling fans have remained the best in the country, while at Old Trafford your unwavering faith has been noticeable and hugely welcomed.

'Supporting your team when they are winning is easy, but much harder when things are not going as well, and the loyalty you have shown us has been magnificent.’
