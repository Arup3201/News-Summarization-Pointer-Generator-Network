National Insurance was introduced by Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George

George Osborne is backing a bid to change the name of National Insurance to ‘earnings tax’.

Tory MP Ben Gummer will introduce a Bill tomorrow to rename the century-old levy on the grounds that it has become misleading.

National Insurance was introduced by Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George in 1913 to pay for state pensions and other benefits.

But it has been decades since National Insurance funds went solely to pay for the welfare state, leading to the charge that it has become just a hidden form of Income Tax.

The Chancellor is understood to be ‘attracted to the idea’ of renaming National Insurance, having previously called for a review of whether it should simply be amalgamated with Income Tax.

But Mr Osborne has not yet made that move fearing voters would be alarmed to see their headline tax rates rise.

Mr Gummer said he was campaigning for the change in order to encourage transparency in the tax system.

He said: ‘I am very pleased the Government is interested in the idea.

'They have been very receptive to trying to make the tax system more transparent.

‘This would be a really good step forward in making what the Government takes from taxpayers clearer and simpler.

‘The most important part is changing the name so in the public mind we can begin the two as the same, which they are. This is a first step.’

The Government has previously resisted changing the name since focus groups have shown that elderly voters still believe National Insurance funds pensions and the NHS and would be horrified if it were abolished, even in name alone.

National Insurance rakes in billions every year for the Treasury. Workers earning between £149 and £797 a week pay 12 per cent of that income in National Insurance.

A further 2 per cent is paid on all earnings over that level. That means many taxpayers are effectively paying 2 per cent extra in income tax, raising the higher rate to 42p in the pound and the top rate to 47p.

Critics say National Insurance is particularly pernicious because, unlike income tax, MPs are not allowed to vote on whether it should be levied every year. Instead they are only asked to approve level of the charge.
