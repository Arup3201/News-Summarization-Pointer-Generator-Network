Harry Redknapp gave the fraudster cash handouts, tickets to football matches and paid for dinners

Harry Redknapp reveals today how he was conned for three years by a fake jockey who he bankrolled in return for racing tips.

The football manager was introduced to the ‘promising apprentice’ one evening at the London casino Les Ambassadeurs.

Redknapp tells the story in his autobiography Always Managing, which is serialised in the Daily Mail this week.

In the series he slams the FA as ‘clueless’, tells of his battle to clear his name over tax fraud charges and describes the devastating effect of the case on his wife Sandra.

The young man at the casino was introduced to him as ‘Lee Topliss’ – the name of a real jockey – and Redknapp, then in charge of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, recalled how he seemed a ‘nice kid’.

‘He wasn’t dressed too well, looked like he could do with a few quid, but very open and chatty,’ wrote Redknapp. ‘If you like a bet, he seemed like a good man to know.’

Conversation between the pair turned from racing to football and the ‘jockey’ told how he ‘loved Tottenham – the only problem is I can never get a ticket’. But thanks to the generosity of Redknapp, that was about to change.

‘Suddenly, he was at near enough every home game,’ he said. ‘He’d ring me up, give me a few tips for horses – they usually got beat – and then arrange to come to the match at the weekend.’

‘Lee’ would even enjoy games in the directors’ box at Manchester United and Arsenal – and for one game sat in a private box next to billionaire Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.

On occasions Redknapp would treat his young friend to dinner and was amazed at how the apprentice, who would need to be at a certain weight in order to meet handicapping requirements, would ‘tuck into his food’.

Redknapp said: ‘I took him to a lovely Italian in Chelsea and he was eating steak and drinking wine and I said, “Lee, how can you eat all this if you’re riding tomorrow?’’ and he said, ‘“Don’t worry ‘Arry. I’ll go for a run at 5am and sweat it all out in the sauna.”’

At one stage, the young man told 
Redknapp that he had been offered the chance to ride for the famous 
Godolphin stable in Dubai where he could win big prize money.

Then
he explained that he could not afford the air fare. The Premier League 
manager lent him £500. ‘I never saw that again, prize money or not,’ he 
recalled.

After Redknapp left Tottenham and had taken over at Queens Park Rangers his jockey friend switched his allegiance and in May this year he had a place in the directors’ box at Anfield when QPR travelled to play Liverpool.

After the game he said he did not have the train fare to get to the races at Newbury the next day.

Once again, Redknapp felt sorry for him and bankrolled him with £150.

Weeks later Redknapp fielded a call from football agent Willie McKay who asked if he was still in touch with his friend ‘Lee Topliss’.

‘Yeah, he’s always ringing me, more losers than winners,’ said Redknapp.

‘He’s not Lee Topliss,’ said McKay. ‘He’s a potman at a boozer in  Newmarket. He picks up glasses – he’s not a f****** jockey.’

Redknapp wrote: ‘Three years he’d had me. The best seat in the house, good restaurants, lifts here, there and everywhere – and heaven knows what in handouts.’

Ironically, the conman was only found out after he had given McKay a ‘rare, successful’ tip and the agent happened to be at a Doncaster race meeting where the real Topliss was riding.

McKay spotted Topliss standing with his back to him in the paddock. He tapped him on the shoulder, introduced himself as ‘Harry’s mate’ and thanked him for the winning tip.

Redknapp said: ‘The jockey stared at Willie as if he was mad ... Then Willie began to study the lad’s face.

‘It wasn’t the “Lee Topliss” he knew, the one he had met with me at Les Ambassadeurs.’

Redknapp said he always regarded himself as streetwise but the fake jockey had been in a ‘different class’. ‘He was a conman preying on the racing scene and the little rogue had us all.’

A spokesman for the real Lee Topliss, 24, who has ridden around 100 winners, said he did not wish to comment.

It has been a turbulent year for Redknapp whose QPR team was relegated from the Premier League in May.

In February he was cleared of tax fraud at Southwark Crown Court. The case had centred on £189,000 in an offshore account he set up in Monaco.
