The number of singletons has risen by 3million in a decade, as more of us choose to live on our own, according to new research.

A detailed analysis of the state of the nation reveals that in some areas more than half of people are unattached, with Islington topping the league tables where almost two in three men and 57 per cent or women are single.

But anyone looking for love in East Devon is going to struggle, because just a quarter of men and fewer than a fifth of women are on the market.

The Office for National Statistics has published an interactive map showing the areas where all the single men, and women, live.

The Office for National Statistics released a interactive series of maps showing where single people live, including this one which shows the percentage of those aged 16 and over who were not living as a couple in 2011

In 2011 over 15.7 million adults or 35 per cent of people aged 16 and over England and Wales had never been married, a rise from 12.5 million (30 per cent) in 2001.

Including people who have been married before but are now divorced or widowed, the total number of singletons hit 23 million in 2011.

This equates to 51 per cent of the population, outnumbering those in couples for the first time. In 2001 there were 19.4 million people classed as ‘not married’, 47 per cent.

The ONS said: ‘The rise in the single population could be the result of a number of factors, including the proportional decline in marriage since the 1970s and the increased social acceptability of remaining single or cohabiting (either never marrying or not re-marrying following divorce or widowhood).’

People who live near the seaside may be more prone to divorce, a new report suggests.

The divorce hot spots of England and Wales are all coastal areas, according to the ONS.

The local authority with the highest proportion of divorcees was Blackpool where 13.1 per cent of the population were divorced.

In Hastings 12.8 per cent of people were divorced while 12.2 per cent of those in Torbay had been through a marriage breakdown.

Weymouth and Portland, Thanet, the Isle of Wight, Gosport, Eastbourne, Great Yarmouth and Worthing also made up the top 10 places with the highest proportions of divorced people.

'The top 10 were all in coastal areas, and mainly on the South coast of England apart from Blackpool and Great Yarmouth,' the report states.

'Higher levels of divorced population may relate to the affordability of housing and living costs in some of these areas resulting in divorced people with reduced economic assets living there.'

The single population is also ageing, in part as a result of more older people being divorced and widowed.

In 2011, the median age of the
 adult population who had never been married was 27.5, a rise from 26.9 
in 2001. Those who were not married in 2011 had a median age of 35.6, a 
rise from 35.0 in 2001.

Of those who had never been married, women were younger than men, with a median age of 26.9 compared with 28 years.

The
 ONS said: ‘This is linked to the trend for women to marry men who are 
older than themselves.However, not married women were on average older 
than men (39.3 and 32.9 years respectively). This is most likely due to 
the higher proportion of widows in the population (10 per cent of adult 
women compared with 3.3 per cent of adult men).’

Islington in North London has the highest proportion of single men (63 per cent), followed by Lambeth (61 per cent) and Hackney (60 per cent).

In Tower Hamlets, Hammersmith and Fulham and Manchester 59 per cent of men were classed as single.

By contrast, just 24 per cent of men in East Devon were single, with 27 per cent single in South Northampton, East Devon and North Kesteven in the East Midlands.

Islington is also the capital of single women, with 57 per cent unattached, ahead of Lambeth on 56 per cent and Hackney 55 per cent.

In Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth and Camden, 53 per cent of women were single.

But in East Dorset just 18 per cent of women were single, followed by Richmondshire (20 per cent) and several areas where only 21 per cent were single.

‘The majority of the top 10 local authorities with the highest proportions of those who were either never married or unmarried were in London,’ the ONS said.

‘Local authorities with high proportions of single people had younger populations. Oxford, for example, appeared in the top 10 for both groups.

‘The area with the lowest proportion of both never married and not married was East Dorset where 21% of the adult population had never been married and a further 18% were divorced or widowed.

‘This reflects the older age structure in this area and higher proportions of the population who were widowed.’

While the top 10 for men and women were dominated by the same areas, in some parts of the country there were marked differences.

In Richmondshire in North Yorkshire there were 21 men to every 10 women who had never been married. 

In the small village of Scotton in Richmondshire, there were 97 men to every 10 women – because it has a large army barracks in the area.

There were more women than men who were not married in coastal areas such as Rother (East Sussex) and Christchurch (Dorset) where there were around 13 women who were not married to every 10 men who were not married.

The ONS added: ‘These coastal areas have an older population and as women have higher life expectancy, this is likely to be due to the number of widows in the population.’
