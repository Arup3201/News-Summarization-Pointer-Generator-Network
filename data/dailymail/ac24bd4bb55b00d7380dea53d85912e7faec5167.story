Dozens of Royal fans turned up at an Asda after hearing the future King was opening the store - only to find a baker named Prince Charles cutting the ribbon instead.

Eager shoppers gathered outside the supermarket in Arnold, Nottingham, yesterday after rumours circulated of a Royal visitor.

But they were disappointed when the guest of honour turned out to be a 55-year-old Asda worker named Prince Charles.

Regal name: Baker Prince Charles who cut the ribbon for an Asda store in Nottingham. Royalists who turned up were expecting the future king

Prince Charles, whose middle name is Rafael, got to cut the ribbon to unveil the new-look store as he has worked for the company for 25 years.

But onlookers who were expecting to see the heir to the throne said they felt duped.

Pensioner Gladys Mortimer, 78, said: 'We thought it would be a bit odd if he opened a supermarket but we thought it could be real so came down to take a look.

'It's a shame really and I feel sorry for him that his parents gave him that name - it's a bit cruel and I bet he's had a bit of stick over the years.

'It was a bit of an anti-climax though.'

Royalist Don Barton, 80, added: 'Everybody had been saying he was coming - but it turns out it was just a cheap stunt to get them some publicity.

'I've travelled 10 miles to be here and I feel duped.'

Prince Charles wore a grey suit over his white bakery overalls and even had a gold crown on his head.

Speaking after the ceremony, the dad-of-five said being named after the successor to the throne meant people always put the phone down on him.

He joked: 'It was an honour to open the store, I enjoyed it and it has made my day.

'When I phone people up and I say my name is Prince Charles they say 'yeah you are joking' and they put the phone down.

The father-of-five is a long-serving member of staff and was honoured by his colleagues

'I try again and they say okay and put the phone down again.

'When I go to the bank or anywhere else I have to show my driving licence or my passport all the time.

'I would love to meet the real Prince Charles and tell him how much trouble his name has caused me but in a funny way.'

Mr Charles, who lives in Nottingham, has worked at Asda for 25 years and has spent the last 15 years at the store in Arnold.

'I would love to meet the real Prince Charles and tell him how much trouble his name has caused me but in a funny way'

Store manager Rebecca Portess today said she chose the bakery worker to cut the ribbon because he was the longest serving member of staff.

She added: 'We nominated him to open the store because he had got the longest service.

'Once we realised people had picked up on his name, we thought we would have a bit of fun with it and got a crown.'
