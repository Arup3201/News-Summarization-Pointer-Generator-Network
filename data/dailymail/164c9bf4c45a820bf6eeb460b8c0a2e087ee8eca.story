Alan Pardew claims that Matt Phillips’ 40-yard wonder strike for QPR against Crystal Palace was better than David Beckham’s goal from inside his own half at Selhurst Park 19 years ago. 

Phillips picked the ball up in the middle of the park and took a touch before belting an effort over Palace keeper Julian Speroni and into the top left corner from 40 yards.  

But it proved to be too little, too late as QPR went down to a 3-1 defeat on Saturday afternoon.

Palace manager Pardew said: ‘I remember Beckham scoring the goal here and, from a technical point of view, Phillips’ was better because it was an outstanding hit.

'Matt can be very proud of it. In 25 or 30 years on a training ground, I can’t remember seeing a better goal.’
