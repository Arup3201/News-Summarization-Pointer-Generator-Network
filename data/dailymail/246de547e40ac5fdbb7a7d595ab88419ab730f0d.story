300 vials of a new Ebola vaccine will arrive in Liberia today, to form part of the largest trial into the efficacy of the experimental drug

The first batch of an experimental Ebola vaccine has been shipped to West Africa, destined to help protect 30,000 people in Liberia.

The shipment, of an initial 300 vials of the vaccine, marks the first to arrive in one of the three countries worst affected by the Ebola epidemic.

The drug will form the basis of the first large-scale vaccine trial, with healthcare workers on the front line treating Ebola patients, among the first to receive the drug.

It comes as the World Health Organisation said this week, the epidemic is showing signs of waning. 

But after ravaging three West African nations and spreading fear from Dallas to Madrid, it has hammered home the message that the world needs a better detective system for emerging diseases.

Researchers hope to enrol up to 30,000 people to take part in the trial, a third of whom will get the vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline. 

The drug is currently being tested in five small phase one safety trials in Britain, the US, Switzerland and Mali and involving around 200 volunteers.

Moncef Slaoui, GSKs global vaccines chief, said: 'The initial phase I data are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases of clinical testing, which will involve the vaccination of thousands of volunteers, including front line healthcare workers.'

The drug uses a type of chimpanzee cold virus to deliver safe genetic material from the Zaire strain of Ebola, the strain responsible for the unprecedented epidemic in West Africa. 

Data so far show 'an acceptable safety profile' including in a West African population and across a range of dose levels, GSK said, adding it had now selected the most appropriate dosage for the Liberia trial.

The World Health Organisation  yesterday said  the Ebola outbreak in West Africa appears to be waning but cautioned against complacency in an epidemic that has seen 21,724 cases reported in nine countries since it started in Guinea a year ago. 

Some 8,641 people have died, according to WHO data.

Mr Slaoui stressed that GSK's shot, like other candidates from a NewLink Genetics and Merck collaboration, and from Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic, is still in development and can't be deployed unless and until it proves safe and effective.

'Any potential future use in mass vaccination campaigns will depend on whether the WHO, regulators and other stakeholders are satisfied ... and how quickly large quantities ... can be made,' he said.  

Professor Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, hailed the move as an 'important step' in the fight against Ebola.

He said: 'In order to show that a vaccine works you have to perform phase III trials in those people most at risk from the infection. 

'Make no mistake, this isn't an easy task; there are huge logistical hurdles to overcome.

It comes as the World Health Organisation said the epidemic, which has ravaged Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, is showing signs of waning

'Ebola virus infection has decimated what was an already under-resourced Liberian healthcare infrastructure, making delivery a tricky thing to achieve. 

'These vaccines also need cold storage, which isn't always easy to guarantee. Also, recruitment to the trials will require a huge effort in social engagement and education.' 

Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, who is helping fund the new vaccine, added: 'This week we've heard encouraging news from West Africa, indicating that we may at last have reached a turning point in what has been the worst Ebola outbreak in history. 

'The unprecedented speed at which the vaccine preparation has progressed would not have been possible without sheer determination and global partnership between national governments, funders, researchers and pharma companies, and agencies on the ground who have worked tirelessly to get this crisis under control.' 

Experts and politicians gathering at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos have focused on the epidemic, noting the risk posed by pandemic threats such as deadly strains of flu and drug-resistant superbugs.

WHO director general Margaret Chan, said: 'Viruses do not need visas to get across borders.'

She admitted the international response to future epidemics must be better co-ordinated. 

Her own organisation has been criticised for failing to move faster to tackle Ebola and has acknowledged that it lacked the staff and tools to fight the epidemic adequately early on. 

'The whole world needs a new early-warning system for these diseases,' said Alpha Conde, the president of Guinea - where Ebola went undetected for three months in early 2014.
