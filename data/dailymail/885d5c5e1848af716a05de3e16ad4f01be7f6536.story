Luke Shaw has called on Manchester United’s fringe players to step forward and help Louis van Gaal find a way out of an injury crisis which has deepened during the international break.

Daley Blind, David de Gea and Michael Carrick have all been injured since leaving for international duty two weeks ago. Blind has damaged knee ligaments, De Gea dislocated a finger and Carrick hurt his groin.

Angel di Maria has had scans on his foot after clashing with United winger Nani - who is at Sporting Lisbon on loan for the season - during Argentina’s game against Portugal at Old Trafford.

The Argentinian playmaker hopes to be fit to face Arsenal on Saturday, as does Shaw, who came off 66 minutes into England’s win in Scotland as a precaution after feeling the muscle tighten in his left hamstring.

‘We know we’ve picked up a lot of injuries, especially in defence, where it’s always changing each time,’ said Shaw. ‘We’ve obviously picked up another injury with Daley Blind but we’ve got to deal with that and try to get around this week and go firing into the game on Saturday.

‘I think it’s time for people to step up, those who are not getting game time and who are frustrated on the bench can come in for a massive game like Arsenal that everyone will want to play in. Everyone will be working hard and focusing on this weekend and come the game, we’ll be ready to go.’

Shaw impressed at left back, winning his fourth cap in the 3-1 win against the Scots before he was replaced by Kieran Gibbs.

‘I picked up a few knocks during the game and my left hamstring, which I hurt at the start of the season, I could feel a little bit,’ said Shaw. ‘We had a discussion at half time over whether to bring me off then but it was a game I didn’t want to come off in, so I played on and then Roy decided to sub me. We’ll have to see. I’m hoping to be fit.’

The 19-year-old defender will be anxious to play against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, and further cement his place in the United side, after his £31million summer transfer from Southampton.

The hamstring problem disrupted his start to the campaign, but he has since forced his way into the team after responding well to Van Gaal’s fitness demands.

‘The fitness side was something me and him talked about,’ said Shaw. ‘But I feel really good at the moment, really fit. It was all about getting a run of games and that’s something I’ve had. Hopefully I can keep getting a run of games and keep improving.

‘It was a frustrating time picking up that injury but the toughest thing was getting back into the team. Now I’ve had a run of games and I’m feeling really good. Hopefully I can show people why United have bought me.’

United defenders Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Rafael and Jonny Evans have all been out but Chris Smalling will return to boost Van Gaal’s options after serving his suspension for the red card at Manchester City.

‘We can’t turn a corner without picking up an injury,’ said Smalling. ‘I’ve been out with injuries, too, and a lot of the defenders have. It’s not easy and it’s hard to pick up momentum. Hopefully, we’ll have a strong team for Saturday.’

It doesn’t help their defensive headaches, but Nani, who has more than four years left on his Old Trafford contract, claims his United career may not be over despite his loan move.

‘It’s a possibility that I might come back to Manchester United,’ said the Portuguese winger after completing 90 minutes in his country’s 1-0 win at Old Trafford.

‘Why not? Let’s see what they say. It will be more difficult in January, but you never know. Coming back is something eventually we have to discuss. At the moment I am focused on my job at Sporting Lisbon where I am doing well.’
