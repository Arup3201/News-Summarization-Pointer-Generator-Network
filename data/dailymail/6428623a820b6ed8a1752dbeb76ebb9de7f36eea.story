Former minister Sir Alan Duncan has called for the five-year fixed parliaments law to be repealed

David Cameron is under growing pressure to agree to tear up the Government's controversial fixed term parliaments act which means general elections take place only once every five years.

Former minister Sir Alan Duncan today calls for a cross-party deal to repeal the legislation, branding it a ‘recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings’.

He is the most senior MP to demand that the law – which will make it all but impossible for either Mr Cameron or Labour leader Ed Miliband to run a minority government if they fail to win a Commons majority next year – is scrapped.

Writing for the Daily Mail, he warns it could also lead to repeated changes of government between 2015 and 2020 without voters having any say.

‘All parties should now combine to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, making the change effective from the day after next May’s election,’ Sir Alan, an international development minister until this summer’s reshuffle, insists.

Critics say few appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election.

It means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the Queen to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable.

Instead, they need to win the support of a 'supermajority' of two-thirds of MPs for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period - meaning the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents.

The only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no confidence. 

But other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held. A new coalition could therefore take power without any election taking place.

Critics say the legislation, cooked up to keep the current coalition together, has ended up being a recipe for never-ending power-sharing government.

The Act has also been widely criticised for creating a 'zombie parliament' with little left to do before May's general election.

Sir Alan warns the sense that current coalition ‘was negotiated behind closed doors will be nothing compared to the public anger if coalitions are formed, broken and re-formed within the five year term of a Parliament without any new election taking place to give them legitimacy’.

The fixed-term parliament law was pushed through by the Coalition after they came into power in 2010

Lord Norton of Louth, Britain’s greatest living expert on Parliament, said of the Act: ‘What is notable is the extent to which its provisions were not that well appreciated at the time and still are not fully understood.

‘Even one academic article on the subject believed that the Queen retained some discretionary powers in respect of dissolution.

‘Prime Ministerial discretion is not involved. The prerogative power in respect of calling an election is gone. The Queen retains no discretionary powers.

‘Under the Act, the provisions are to be reviewed in 2020. However, given the criticisms now being directed at the measure, pressure for some change may become such as to prompt some change.’

Veteran Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh agreed his party should commit to scrapping the legislation. 'We've never had fixed term parliaments in the past and it creates terrible inflexibility.

'It was created artificially just for the sake of the current coalition, supposedly to stop one party walking off, rather than any good constitutional innovation. Five-year parliaments are too long. We should repeal it.'

The growing realisation at Westminster that Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg have overseen constitutional changes that ensure future coalitions are far more likely will anger some MPs who had not appreciated their long-term implications.

Some senior Tories, including at least two Cabinet ministers, believe Mr Cameron should have run a minority government after failing to win an outright majority in May 2010 and gone back to the country in a second election in October of that year.

One Conservative MP sceptical about the coalition said: 'The coalition was a mistake in the first place, and now Cameron and Clegg are going to leave behind a law tying the hands of future party leaders.'

Sir Alan Duncan warns that while the agreement to stay the course has served the country well, a permanent constitutional change will not

A short term fix can do long term damage. So it is with the decision to introduce fixed-term five year parliamentary sessions. It might be good for now: but it’s bad for the future.

Until recently General Elections were governed by the Parliament Act 1911, which allowed for a maximum Parliamentary term of five years. Crucially, though, it afforded the sitting Prime Minister the authority to call an election at any time.

The Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 changed this to a rigid five year term, with no easy mechanism for shortening it. Consequently, everyone has known for years that the date of the next election will be 7th May 2015.

The Prime Minister’s power to dissolve Parliament under the historic Royal Prerogative has lapsed. The new fixed term of five years can only be curtailed if two thirds of MPs vote for dissolution, or if the House of Commons passes a vote of no confidence in one Government, but fails to pass a vote of confidence in an alternative one within a fortnight.

We can all see why this was agreed. The only way a viable government could be formed after the 2010 election was for Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to join as one to create a parliamentary majority. 

The Liberal Democrats needed to guard against being wrong-footed by a Conservative Prime Minister exercising his historic right to pick the election date and choosing to do so at the worst time for the Liberal Democrats. 

A deal to agree how long the Government should last was an essential part of the glue which bound the Coalition together. 

The agreement to stay the course has served the country well, but a permanent constitutional change will not.

A fixed term in office and pre-determined election dates might suit a Presidency. They do not in normal circumstances suit a Parliament. 

Unlike a Presidency, where that top person remains one and the same, Parliament is an organic institution: its characteristics and composition can change in the course of one year, let alone five. 

Some MPs will die or resign, others may cross the floor. In the course of our history parties have split or merged. 

Between elections the nature of Parliament, which underpins the energies and legitimacy of a government, can change dramatically. 

The pressures and changes in the Commons can be at their most acute when there is a tiny majority for the government of the day or, worse, no straightforward majority at all.

There have been many such occasions in our history, when it has been best for the country to have a General Election at moments which would have been impossible if we had fixed-term Parliaments.

After the February 1974 election Ted Heath tried unsuccessfully to hang on as Prime Minister, before accepting the arithmetic was against him. 

The Wilson government that took over felt obliged to return to the polls just a few months later, achieving a wafer thin majority. 

Jim Callaghan’s government fell once the Scottish and Welsh nationalists deserted the Labour Government after the devolution referendums of 1979. John Major governed with a very slim majority between 1992 and 1997 with by-election defeats making the Government live on an ever sharper knife edge.

The point is that all these Prime Ministers had the option, when the make-up of Parliament changed, to pull the plug and seek a stronger mandate from the voters. Even when they chose not to, the House of Commons had the power to force their hand with a simple Vote of No Confidence, as in 1979.

The Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, erects new hurdles that make it harder to dissolve Parliament mid-way through its term. As a result, it is a recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings. This will weaken, not strengthen, public confidence in our politics.

The sense that the current Coalition was negotiated behind closed doors will be nothing compared to the public anger if coalitions are formed, broken and re-formed within the five year term of a Parliament without any new election taking place to give them legitimacy.

For if the Government were to lose a vote of no confidence, the Prime Minister could no longer call an election and dissolve Parliament. 

Now, the Opposition would have the chance to cobble together its own majority by wooing potential partners. 

All this would happen hidden from view in the corridors of Westminster, with the ballot box nowhere in sight. 

In this scenario the leader of a smaller party, acting as kingmaker, could simply walk away from their coalition partner and prop up the Opposition, without the trouble of asking any voter for their opinion.

These are the unintended permanent consequences of an Act designed to fix a temporary problem.

It is in every party’s interests and every voter’s interests to have strong, accountable government. To do so, all parties should now combine to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, making the change effective from the day after next May’s election.

If we don’t do this we will all regret having to live with a law suitable for holding together one term of Parliament, but wholly inappropriate for all of those which follow.
