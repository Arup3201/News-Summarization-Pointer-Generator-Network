Delighted as she and William undoubtedly are, the duchess’s pregnancy could not have come at a more chaotic time for the royal couple.

The duke is about to make one of the biggest decisions of his life so far – whether to extend his time in the RAF or quit to become a full-time working royal.

And to make matters worse, the couple still won’t have a permanent home by the time the baby is born early next summer.

Kate and William’s planned move to their glitzy new apartment in Kensington Palace is now unlikely to take place until October 2013.

Contractors refurbishing Apartment 1A, which used to belong to Princess Margaret, have uncovered asbestos which has to be cleared before the couple – let alone a newborn baby – can move in.

Sources close to the Cambridges also say the apartment, which has since been used as offices and exhibition space by Historic Royal Palaces, was ‘virtually uninhabitable’ when it was inspected after their wedding last year.

When the baby is born Kate and Wills are likely to still be living at Nottingham Cottage but hope to move into Margaret's former apartment as soon as possible

It has no kitchen or bathroom and needed total rewiring and plastering, none of which could be started until the apartment was fully vacated by the charity’s staff just a few weeks ago.

‘At the moment there is just no way their new home will be inhabitable by the time the baby is born,’ said one.

This means that when they become parents, the couple will still be shuttling between their relatively modest rented farmhouse on Anglesey in North Wales, and the two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.

If the duchess’s health continues to suffer, the couple are also likely to face another major domestic hurdle.

William is tied to his base in North Wales for at least the next nine months. But Kate is more than likely to be forced to stay nearly 300 miles away in London – alone – to be closer to her gynaecologist.

Kate’s natural desire to be close to her mother, Carole Middleton, may also mean the duchess is more likely to stay in Nottingham Cottage. It is only 50 miles from her parents’ £4.85million home in Bucklebury, Berkshire.

And if she stayed in London, Kate would only be a short drive away from the Marylebone hospital where she has been treated since Monday.
