If you think relations with unions are difficult now, take a look at this mansion which a millionaire businessman built with fort-like defences to keep out activists in the 1800s.

The spectacular £1.95m home in Newport, South Wales, was built by a wealthy Victorian industrialist.

Magnate John Jenkins put up the walls to keep out 'invaders' as he feared the rise of Chartists - the early trade unionists.

Mansion: The home in the Welsh town of Carleon near Newport is on the market for £1.95m and comes complete with it's own fort and Stone defences

He wanted the defences around the mansion, the Mynde in Caerleon, to protect the property from any working class enemies. But today the stone fortications mark the grounds and gardens of the luxury family home.

Current owner Terry Greenhaf, a successful engineer, said: 'The house has history and lots of it.

'We’ve brought our children up here and it’s also a very peaceful, relaxing home where owls and buzzards fly by, herons come and visit.

'You can just sit or walk in the grounds and think you’re right in the heart of the countryside.'

Fort: The home was built in 1839 by wealthy trade unionist John Jenkins. He erected the stone defences to keep out activists

Luxury: As well as the fortified defences, the mansion has 20 rooms, a swimming pool and a bar nestled in the heart of the Welsh countryside

Defences: The home has a wall around it and fortified defences which were built to keep out 'invaders'. Current owner Terry Greenhaf, a successful engineer, says the house has lots of history and is a 'peaceful, relaxing home'

The property’s stone fortifications were
built in 1839 by Mr Jenkins, who was a tin plate businessman turned 
High Sheriff of Monmouthshire.

He constructed the walls for protection against the Chartists - working class activists who campaigned for the right to vote.

The Chartists were becoming increasingly belligerent and the sheriff built the wall to keep them off his land.

Today the three and a half acre site is home to a 20 room mansion complete with it’s own swimming pool and a bar.

The house also boasts seven reception rooms, five bedrooms, four bathrooms, sitting rooms and a triple garage.

Secluded: The mansion, the Mynde in Caerleon, is up for sale after being owned by the same person for 35 years

Land: The three and a half acre site is home to lots of wildlife and is regularly visited by owls, buzzards and herons

Walks: The owner says you feel like you are completely in the countryside while walking through the grounds

But the property is now up for sale after the Greenhaf family, who have lived there for 35 years, said they want to 'downsize'.

Peter Reilly, head of residential sales at estate agent Savills’ Cardiff office said: 'The property is spectacular.

'Ornamental plaster work, wooden doors and wide staircases add to the feeling of opulence throughout this most elegant property.

'The gardens have been beautifully landscaped with low walls, raised borders, ornamental railings and a lovely pergola-covered walk to side of the house.

'There are also far reaching views over the River Usk and the countryside beyond.'

Picturesque: The house also boasts seven reception rooms, five bedrooms, four bathrooms, sitting rooms and a triple garage

Peaceful: The home is surrounded by a fort and stone defences leaving it totally untouched

Grounds: The mansion comes with a large garden as well as a pond and swimming pool
