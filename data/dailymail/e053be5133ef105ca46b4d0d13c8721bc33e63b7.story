Warren Gatland has made just two changes to his starting XV for Wales' second Test match against South Africa on Saturday.

Samson Lee, who makes his first start for the side, comes into the front row for veteran Adam Jones, who is dropped from the squad completely.

The other change sees Josh Turnbull replace Aaron Shingler at flanker.

Mike Phillips retains his place at scrum-half in an unchanged back-line while captain Alun Wyn Jones will make his 80th Wales appearance alongside Luke Charteris in the second row.

Gatland's side were beaten 38-16 in Durban last Saturday and the Wales head coach wants his players to bounce back.

'We have been really happy with the response from the players during training this week, we have had a good week and we see Saturday as an opportunity to right the wrongs of last weekend,' Gatland told the Welsh Rugby Union's official website.

Keeping faith: Warren Gatland has kept 13 of the 15 players who were convincingly beaten in Durban

'We were disappointed with last week's display but we want to finish the season with a big performance and show what we know we are capable of.

'It's a great opportunity for Samson and Josh and they deserve the chance after impressing from the bench last weekend.'
