Swiss teenager Belinda Benic, who has been compared to Martina Hingis, fell back down to earth after crashing out of the US Open quarter-finals 6-2, 6-1 to Peng Shuai.

The 17-year-old had taken Flushing Meadows by storm, reaching the last eight while taking the scalps of top 10 players Angelique Kerber and Jelena Jankovic.

However, the wheels of her dramatic run came off in spectacular fashion after she was beaten by the unseeded doubles specialist from China for the loss of just three games. 

Eastern promise: Peng Shuai reached the US Open semi-finals despite being unseeded

All good things: Belinda Benic reached the US Open quarter-finals as an unseeded 17-year-old

Empire state of mind: The 28-year-old will play either Caroline Wozniacki or Sara Errani in the last four 

Shuai used a lot of angles and varied here shots to unsettle the youngster as she swept through the first set before racing to a 5-0 lead in the second and serving outfor the match at 5-1.

The teenager was also given a coaching violation during the second set for apparently receiving instruction from her entourage. The Serbian-born youngster appealed to the umpire but never regained her composure.

It has nevertheless been a superb tournament for the teenager, who has worked with Martina Hingis' mother, Melanie Molitor, since she was four and often practises with Hingis.

Ranked 331 a year ago, she is the youngest player in the top 100 and is projected to climb into the top 35 when the rankings are updated next week.  

Warning: The teenager appeals to the umpire after receiving a coaching violation in the second set

If at first you don't succeed: Peng Shuai reached here first grand slam semi-final in 37 attempts

This was the first time that Shuai has reached a grand slam semi-final after 37th attempts and the 28-year-old gave an emotional speech after the game.

Speaking through tears, she said: 'It's an amazing time for me. It's a little bit too exciting.

'I love tennis but it's a long time my career, it's been tough sometimes. I was thinking about giving up because I don't know if I can make it.

'I want to say thanks to my coach and my parents because they tell me to fight and never give up. And that today was coming.'

Shuai will play either Caroline Wozniacki or Sara Errani in the last four.
