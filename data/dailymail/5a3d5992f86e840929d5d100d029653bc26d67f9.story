Forget Lord of The Rings, this is Lord of The Ruffs.

A pet pug is casting a spell over its owner who has dressed it as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings.

This is one of the hilarious outfits modelled by a trio of pugs who have been transformed into hobbits, rock stars and even royalty.

Owner Phillip Lauer, 57, said: 'They are the family photos that we put up on our walls just like other people do of their kids.

Ready for action: Blue dressed as Boromir, who was one of the Nine Walkers who made up the Fellowship of the Ring

'Yes, it's a lot of time and effort but we have a lot of great memories and photos to share. It puts a smile on our faces, too.'

Mr Lauer and his wife Sue have been transforming their dogs Blue, Bono and Roxy, for the past six years.

It started with local dog-dressing competitions and making creative holiday cards for friends, but soon spiralled into a full-time hobby.

They have even built a custom studio at the family home in Sonoma County, California, to take professional-standard shots.

Most of their latest creations - including their favourite outfit, Boromir - have come from J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

The have titled the series the Pugs of Middle Earth. Others subjects include lifeguard pugs, rock star pugs, and pugs in Parka jackets.

When they cannot buy the outfits, Mrs Lauer, 47 who has a degree in fashion design, makes them and can spend up to 20 days sewing a single costume.

Mr Lauer, an IT professional, said: 'As we entered larger and more competitive costume contests, we really pushed ourselves to do more complex costumes.

'We continually challenge ourselves to keep getting better or try harder things.'

He added: 'As far as who is best, all three are good. It's almost as if they are competing with each other to be best in front of the camera.

'We save the most challenging costumes for Blue to wear, Bono does the best action shots in costume and Roxy has a great range from coy to diva.

'We love our pugs and looking through the photos is looking back at our journey with our pugs. The hard part now is deciding which ones do we want to do next.'
