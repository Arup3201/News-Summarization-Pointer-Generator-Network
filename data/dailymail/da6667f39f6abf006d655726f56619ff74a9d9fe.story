Dreading the big reveal on the beach? So was I, until I discovered this summer’s answer to wobbly thighs, stretch marks and bulging love handles: the skirtini.

As the name suggests, it’s not a skirt, it’s not a bikini — it’s both: swimwear that comes with a little skirt attached to skim over lumpy thighs and cover wobbly bottoms. Many are all-in-one swimsuits which incorporate extra fabric into the design but there are also tankini tops that come with briefs that are not so brief thanks to a nifty skirt overlay.

Even bikinis can be skirtinis — you get the same bra top, but the skirted bottom gives extra coverage just where you need it.

But be warned: the length of the skirt and the cut of the top has to be just perfect to flatter — but get it right and a well-chosen skirtini will totally transform how you look — and feel — on the beach this summer.

Floral print swimkini, £35.99, moontide.com

This has a bright, jolly pattern and the ruching across the tummy is forgiving. The frilly bit skims the top of the thighs nicely but didn’t cover my entire bottom and sadly the padded top squashed my boobs, so not so great for anyone over a D cup.

SCORE: 3/5

Samantha Sage Charleston swimsuit in navy with cream bow, £89, samanthasage.com

An elegant, classic design in 
forgiving navy that miraculously enhances curves without resorting to 
tummy control panels or underwiring. Instead, it’s cleverly cut with a 
short, playful, frill that is perfectly positioned to give an hourglass 
silhouette. It’s very comfortable, too, and I feel great in it. Worth 
the investment.

SCORE: 5/5

Curvy Kate birds of paradise tankini top, £40 matching skirt £26,  figleaves.com

A fun pattern and skirt is really 
flattering, covering the bottom without hiding too much leg. But as soon
 as I put the top on, I looked more like I was heading to a tennis court
 than a swimming pool. The top is way too long and loose.

SCORE: 2/5

Magisculpt swim dress, £49, Marisota.co.uk

Ladies, throw away your sarongs. In this flirty swim dress, everything’s covered. You won’t get much of a tan wearing it but if you’re going to a beach wedding or party, you won’t need to change when you fancy a dip! Not for serious lane swimming but for posing poolside, it’s a winner.

SCORE: 4.5/5

Sea by Melissa Odabash swim dress, £45, Simplybe.co.uk

A Little Black Dress for the beach. How 
glam. You could wear this from beach to bar and vice versa. The skirt 
hides the tops of the thighs and the gold detail on the halterneck adds a
 little dazzle without looking too TOWIE. It lacks a little in boob 
support and waist definition but it’s very comfortable.

SCORE: 3.5/5

Freya halter neck top & matching skirted brief both, £32, Leialingerie.com

If you thought your bikini days were 
over, think again. This blue skirtini with mini polka dots hides the 
mummy tummy perfectly. The underwired bra top, in bra sizes up to an H 
cup, is flattering and feminine as well as comfortable. I love the 
colour and the frills. It makes me feel years younger.

SCORE: 5/5
