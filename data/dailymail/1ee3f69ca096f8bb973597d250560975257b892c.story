Two undercover police officers who had children with female activists from environmentalist groups they infiltrated have been named for the first time by Scotland Yard today.

A High Court judge has forced the Met to reveal the identities of Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert who joined protest groups to feed information back to the Yard in the 80s and 90s.

Women they had sexual relationships with are suing because they claim the men deceived them - but Boyling and Lambert - who had fake identities - claim that they were genuinely in love.

Last month High Court judge Mr Justice Bean ruled the Met could not use its policy of 'neither confirm nor deny' (NCND) in response to damages claims brought by women who said they were tricked into forming relationships with undercover officers.

The force's long-standing NCND policy was designed to protect the identities and safety of officers working undercover. 

Boyling - who took the name Jim Sutton - had sex with three women between 1995 and 2000. He later married one of them and they had two children with her before they divorced six years ago.

Lambert - who took the name Bob Robinson and pretended to be a left-wing environmentalist - had affairs with for women between 1984 and 1988 and had a son with one of the women. One relationship lasted 18-months.

Both men were members of the Yard's undercover Special Demonstration Squad. 

But after the judge issued the force an ultimatum, the identities of the officers have been disclosed in court papers filed as part of the force's defence to the civil claims, the Met confirmed today.

A spokesman for the Met said: 'In compliance with the order of Mr Justice Bean the MPS has confirmed in its defence that Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert were undercover police officers.'

The women are among a number of people who want compensation for emotional trauma allegedly caused by officers infiltrating environmental activist groups.

Their claims for deceit, assault, negligence and misfeasance in public office arise out of long-term and intimate sexual relationships they had with four men who - unknown to them - were members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), between 1987 and 2007.

Mr Justice Bean issued an ultimatum which forced the Met to disclose the names in its defence in order to be able to answer to the claims and had the force not done so within 28 days it would have been taken to admit them.

At the time, lawyers for the women described the ruling as a 'devastating blow' for the Met.

Solicitor Harriet Wistrich of Birnberg Peirce and Partners said: 'The police have been on notice of this case for three and a half years and until this judgment, they have wilfully refused to engage in any meaningful way with the most serious allegations put to them.

'Their ongoing refusal in the face of an overwhelming body of evidence in the public domain has greatly aggravated the distress caused to my clients, who want answers from the police as well as justice and accountability.'
