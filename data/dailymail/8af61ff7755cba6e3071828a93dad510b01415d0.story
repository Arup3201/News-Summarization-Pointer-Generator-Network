Newcastle are interested in taking Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry on loan.

The Germany Under 21 forward could find first team chances hard to come by next season, particularly after the arrival of Alexis Sanchez.

And Magpies chief Alan Pardew wants to test the water with a season-long loan bid.

Gnabry, 19, is highly rated by the Gunners, who won’t let him leave permanently.

But Arsene Wenger may consider letting the youngster leave on a temporary basis to enable the forward to gain valuable first team experience.

Southampton are also interested in taking Gnabry on loan.
