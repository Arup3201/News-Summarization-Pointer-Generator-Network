Women have uncovered the abusive pasts of more than 1,300 partners under Clare's Law since it was introduced 12 months ago.

The figures underline the shocking scale of abuse taking place behind closed doors across England and Wales.

Police forces took action on more than one out of three occasions, passing on sensitive information 1,335 times out of 3,760 applications. 

Clare's Law was rolled out nationally in March last year, following a 14-month pilot in Gwent, Wiltshire, Nottinghamshire and Greater Manchester.

It allows the police to disclose information about a partner's previous history of domestic violence or violent acts.

The scheme is named after Clare Wood, 36, who was strangled and set on fire in 2009 by her ex-boyfriend who had a hidden history of abuse.

Her father Michael Brown, 71, said he is 'quietly delighted' the law is being used, but fears the figures are only the 'tip of the iceberg'.

He said: 'This is just people that are coming to the fore. This is only the tip of the iceberg. There's an awful lot of it not reported, people are frightened to come forward.

'We didn't have the lofty ambitions to do away with domestic violence – that would have been nonsensical.

'What we did was try to give ladies and gents who were in trouble another chink in their armour. I think we succeeded in that.

'This is just the start. This is what it is in just the first year, all these people know about Clare's Law, they're going to tell another five, another dozen, and next year this is going to snowball.'

Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws revealed huge regional variations in the likelihood of information being released.

Outside the four forces involved with the Clare's Law pilot, Lancashire had the highest number of disclosures at 146, while Norfolk had made five disclosures, the lowest level.

Greater Manchester is the force most likely to reveal information, which it did in 60 per cent of cases, while in neighbouring Merseyside the figure is just 11 per cent.

Miss Wood, 36, was strangled and set on fire by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester.

Appleton had a history of violence towards women and prowled dating websites, often using different aliases. He hanged himself six days later in a derelict pub.

Other figures revealed the courts have granted 2,220 domestic violence protection orders, which can be used to protect victims.

The orders were launched in the same month following a one-year pilot in West Mercia, Wiltshire and Greater Manchester.

Salford and Eccles MP Hazel Blears, who campaigned for the law, said the figures show the scale of the threat of domestic violence.

But she said she is concerned that the variations in disclosures suggest the law is being applied differently by forces.

Last year, the police watchdog found thousands of domestic violence victims are being failed by police due to 'alarming and unacceptable weaknesses'.

There were 269,700 domestic abuse-related crimes in England and Wales between 2012 and 2013, with 77 women killed by their partners or ex-partners in the same period.

On average, the police receive an emergency call relating to domestic violence every 30 seconds and around 8 per cent of recorded crime is made up of abuse in the home.

Polly Neate, of Women's Aid, said any woman who asks for help under Clare's Law should also be referred to support groups for help.
