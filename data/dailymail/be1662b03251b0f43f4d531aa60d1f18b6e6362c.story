If Queens Park Rangers do defy all odds and expectations and stay in the Premier League for another season, what price can be placed on the contribution of Charlie Austin?

After 17 goals to return them to the promised land last term, Austin took this season’s tally to seven as they recorded an immensely valuable win over fellow strugglers Leicester City.

His 74th-minute header settled a thrill-a-minute contest at Loftus Road and lifted Rangers off the bottom of the table. Their place was taken by Leicester, who simply failed to take their chances.

‘It was an open, attacking game — an excellent game with both teams going for it,’ said Harry Redknapp. ‘We went one down in the first five minutes and it was their first goal for a while; they’re a dangerous team on the counter.

‘We could have felt sorry for ourselves but we didn’t. We came back and made lots of chances. It was an excellent performance with a lot of pressure on the game today.’

The visitors led after only four minutes, through a classy finish from Esteban Cambiasso, but succumbed to pressure and trailed at half-time thanks to Wes Morgan’s calamitous own goal and Leroy Fer’s opportunism.

The Foxes, whose winless streak in London now stands at 17 Premier League matches, levelled in the second half through Jeffrey Schlupp but failed to hang on as Austin scored once again at home. It was his fifth in six appearances here this season, all of great value.

It may only be late November, but with Leicester 18th and QPR 20th at the start of play, the term ‘six-pointer’ could just about be justified. QPR will be feeling much more optimistic about their situation.

A burst water main at nearby Wood Lane had caused problems earlier in the day, but all Leicester were interested in was ending a drought.

It was 500 minutes or five matches since their fans had last been able to celebrate a goal. But that agonising wait ended at 504.

On their first assault, Schlupp fed the ball in from the left and Leonardo Ulloa nudged it right to the incoming Cambiasso.

With the understated class that has seen him win championships in three countries and the Champions League, the veteran Argentine rolled the ball in off the post.

The last time Cambiasso scored, Leicester beat Manchester United 5-3. Was it an omen?

A second goal would have helped and Jamie Vardy surged through a few minutes later but a careless first touch let him down and Rob Green pounced to swipe the ball from his feet.

Vardy then left Onuoha for dead on the right and crossed for Riyad Mahrez who fluffed his lines badly when confronted with Green’s gigantic frame and sent the ball wide of the far post.

Rangers had enjoyed most of the ball but it took them an age to start creating meaningful chances. Karl Henry waltzed his way into a shooting position but failed to release the ball, much to the crowd’s consternation.

He tried to find the bottom corner on 27 minutes from outside the box but it just looked pathetic when the lurking Vargas didn’t bother to stick out a boot.

The pressure mounted, with Barton industrious and Suk-Young Yun marauding down the left, and it finally told on 37 minutes. Christmas may yet be a month away, but this equaliser was gift-wrapped.

Steven Caulker, somehow, was in Leicester’s penalty box and his poked cross was bundled into his own net by Morgan, who didn’t adjust his feet to make the anticipated clearance. His team-mates looked on non-plussed.

Straight from the re-start, Leicester caught their opponents napping and Vardy’s powerful strike hit Green on the chest.

Then, on the stroke of half-time, the second goal QPR’s dominance of possession probably deserved.

All their own work this time as Barton swung in an inviting cross from the right, Austin launched into a header that Schmeichel beat out. But there was Fer, following up, to smash home the rebound, his first goal since joining from Norwich.

Leicester, determined not to become the victims of QPR’s third league win of the season, started the second half brightly. Mahrez forced Green into a block before his right-wing delivery was flicked onto the crossbar by Vardy.

A third goal would have been handy for QPR and Austin looked the most likely to provide it. First, he saw a first-time shot deflected into the side-netting of Marcin Wasilewski and then, after a very neat exchange with Vargas, his volley was well saved by Schmeichel.

The game swung in the balance and Cambiasso’s quick free-kick caught the QPR defence asleep. Vardy raced onto it but could only find the side-netting.

It didn’t provide the wake-up call the hosts needs and, on 67 minutes, Leicester were level. Schlupp was fouled on the edge of the box but referee Roger East played an advantage. From a subsequent cross, Cambiasso headed down for Marc Albrighton to blast one.

His effort was blocked but it fell invitingly for Schlupp, back on his feet, to find the net with a crisp left-footed finish.

QPR responded superbly. Schmeichel saved brilliantly from Fer’s header but the resulting corner caused panic in the Leicester defence.

Onuoha’s close-range effort after a mad scramble was blocked on the line by David Nugent but there was Austin with a stooping header to send Loftus Road into raptures. Austin whipped off his shirt in celebration. I suspect he won’t care about the booking.

Pearson said: ‘I feel for the players today because in terms of an attacking unit, we were very good at times. Our goals were the two hardest chances. We were very positive, created chances but still couldn’t win the game.’
