West Bromwich Albion are in talks over a loan for Liverpool defender Andre Wisdom on loan.

Manager Alan Irvine has lined up the move with a deal for Aston Villa's Alan Hutton looking unlikely.

Irvine has signed Hannover 96 left-back Sebastien Poconogli for Â£1.5m but remain interested in Australian left-back Jason Davidson too.
