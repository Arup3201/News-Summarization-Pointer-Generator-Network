Murderer: Paul Groves, 34, who bludgeoned to death William 'Billy Boy' Martindale, 39, with the handle of a pickaxe

A factory worker bludgeoned a self-styled Essex gangster to death using the handle of a pickaxe in a row over drugs.

Paul Groves, 34, was today found guilty of murdering William 'Billy Boy' Martindale, 39, in a savage attack on his remote smallholding in High Ongar, Essex.

He knocked his friend unconscious by punching him before repeatedly hitting him with the weapon.

The cold-blooded killer was also found guilty of causing severe head injuries to another man, Paul Meeking, 55, in the attack.

Victim Mr Martindale, a father-of-three, wrote a book about his gangster lifestyle and claimed to have two £50,000 contracts on his head.

But during the trial at Chelmsford Crown Court his grieving wife, Tina Joseph, 35, said: 'I don't think he was a gangster. He just thought he was one.'

Groves launched his attack on Martindale and Meeking, from Barking, Essex, following a row over drugs on September 7 last year. Meeking was in hospital for four days following the incident.

Today a jury took two-and-a-half hours two unanimously find him guilty of murder and causing grievous bodily harm.

During the trial Groves claimed that Martindale had boasted about killing two hitmen.

He claimed that he attacked the father with the pickaxe after punching him because he feared he would get up and kill him.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Marina Ericson, said: 'We are delighted with today's verdict.

'The evidence heard throughout the trial demonstrated the level of violence used by Paul Groves when he brutally attacked both Billy Martindale and Paul Meeking.

'Paul Groves is a violent man whose intention to cause serious harm to both Mr Martindale and Mr Meeking has been proven.

'Our thoughts continue to go out to Billy's family and friends at this time. We hope this verdict will provide them with some comfort and allow them to move on with their lives, following what has been a very distressing period for them.'

Mr Martindale's book about his alleged gangster lifestyle was called 'Wanted: My Life on the Run as Billy Boy Yates'.

Today his wife said: 'These past few months have been quiet and we have certainly felt the loss of Billy. Our lives are empty without him as he brought character to our day.

'He had a bubbly personality and I am so angry that his dispute with Paul Groves got out of hand and left my children fatherless.

'I am even more angry that Billy was assaulted in front of his children and Paul Groves should be ashamed of himself for allowing this to happen. It infuriates me.

'My children and I would like to thank other members of the family, friends and neighbours who have supported or offered support throughout the past eight months. They have been invaluable.

'We miss Billy dearly and life isn't the same without him. After this verdict and Paul Groves' sentencing, we can hopefully rebuild our lives and plan for the future. We must not dwell on the past.'

Groves is due to be sentenced at the same court tomorrow.
