To some observers, it always seemed rather odd that Abu Hamza al-Masri spent eight years and more than £150,000 of British taxpayers’ money fighting extradition to America.

After all, the militant Islamist preacher had been in a British prison — principally at Belmarsh in South London and, later, Long Lartin in Worcestershire — since May 2004. Did it really make that much difference, swapping a jail cell in one hated infidel country for a jail cell in another?

But the former Soho nightclub bouncer — convicted in Britain of ‘soliciting to murder’ and inciting racial hatred — has always feared the Americans getting their hands on him.

Hook: Abu Hamza, the former Soho nightclub bouncer - convicted in Britain of 'soliciting to murder' and inciting racial hatred - has always feared the Americans getting their hands on him

And today, as he languishes in near-solitary confinement in the grim Metropolitan Correctional Centre in Manhattan, he can stare at his 7½ft x 8ft cell’s stained breeze-block walls and reflect that he was right to be afraid.

For years, the Egyptian-born preacher abused the hospitality of the country that gave him a home — quite literally, housing his large family in a smart West London street, and supporting them with state benefits — by attacking its values and calling for its violent overthrow.

But while the British Government is deeply relieved to rid itself of him after years of embarrassment and exasperation, U.S. officials haven’t been able to hide their delight at finally getting their hands on him.

After the September 11 attacks destroyed the Twin Towers, Hamza crowed: ‘Many people will be happy, jumping up and down at this moment.’ Today, that’s a fair description of the American government’s feelings on having him in its power.

Eleven years after Hamza’s hate-filled sermons inspired 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui (and months later did the same for Londoner Richard Reid, who tried to bring down a Miami-bound American Airlines flight with a shoe bomb), he has arrived in a country that loathes him as much as he loathes it.

The New York Post summed up the prevailing mood: ‘Now he’s all ours,’ it said.

Hamza and the other three suspects extradited with him were ‘at the nerve centres of Al Qaeda’s terror networks and will finally face justice’, according to Preet Bharara, the U.S. district attorney who will lead the prosecution. Peter King, a local U.S. congressman and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, described Abu Hamza as ‘obviously an arrogant b*****d’ and an ‘evil person’.

In the U.S., 54-year-old Hamza faces 11 terrorism charges relating to three plots, among them the 1998 kidnapping in Yemen of 16 tourists, including two Americans, in which three Britons and an Australian died.

He is also accused of supporting the setting up of a terrorist training camp in Oregon, and fomenting violent jihad in Afghanistan. He has pleaded not guilty, but faces a life sentence — and, in America, life is likely to mean life — if convicted.

Already, he has experienced the brutally no-nonsense approach of U.S. law-enforcement: on arrival, his famous hooks were confiscated as a security risk, and last Saturday he was forced to make a court appearance with the stumps of his arms protruding from the short sleeves of his navy blue jumpsuit. (Hamza says he lost both hands and an eye in a landmine explosion during the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan.)

But this is just the start: he can expect no quarter from U.S. authorities determined to make his life as uncomfortable as possible. At one stage, prison guards at the Manhattan jail — where breakfast is powdered egg, tinned tomatoes and toast — boasted that he was having to eat through a straw as none of them were willing to feed him.

Contrast this with the softly-softly approach of human rights-obsessed Britain, where prison officials paid £650 to fit special hook-friendly taps in his Belmarsh cell.

For now, his American lawyers have won him the right to wear his hooks for short periods each day so he can feed and wash himself. And the U.S. government has agreed to pay around $16,000 for a set of rubber prosthetic hands — though only the basic model, officials stress. While British taxpayers paid millions for his detention costs, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman stressed that official policy states all inmates’ health services ‘will be obtained at the lowest possible cost’.

Hamza has, at least, managed to wrangle a new pair of anti-slip trainers after his lawyer pleaded that, without his hooks to break his fall, he could injure himself if he trips over. Such are the concerns these days of the infamous preacher of hate.

While he waits to go on trial — which could take anywhere from nine months to two years — Hamza will remain in the bleak New York jail that has housed fraudster Bernie Madoff and Mafia boss John Gotti.

The 14-storey concrete building has held previous terror suspects in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, and 24 hours at weekends. Hamza’s hour of exercise in a caged area on the roof is likely to be equally lonely, say ex-wardens.

Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, known as the Merchant of Death, has spent 14 months there in solitary confinement. His lawyers claimed conditions were ‘barbaric’, comparing it with the imprisonment of the fictional Count of Monte Cristo and complaining that Bout had been denied ‘basic, God-given rights, like fresh air and sun’.

Unfortunately for Bout, it looks as if he will be transferred to somewhere his lawyers described as ‘even worse’ — the ‘Supermax’ ADX Florence facility in Colorado.

Supermax, nicknamed the Alcatraz of the Rockies, is America’s toughest prison for its roughest prisoners. After the U.S. gave assurances that Hamza would not be sent to the military base at Guantanamo Bay, the Supermax is almost certain to be his destination if convicted.

Almost all America’s most notorious terrorists, domestic or foreign, are held here, with the country’s most vicious gang leaders and drug lords.

Hamza had long fought extradition at the European Court of Human Rights by claiming that conditions at Supermax amount to torture, but this was rejected by the court.

Suffice to say that Supermax, described by a former warden as a ‘clean version of Hell’, is a far cry from HMP Belmarsh. At the latter, which houses some of Britain’s most dangerous men, staff and prisoners are increasingly intimidated by Muslim inmates, who account for one in five of the prison population.

Islamic extremists — who sit at the top of the prison pecking order and are widely feared — are reportedly recruiting new followers unmolested in Belmarsh’s prison yard.

In such an environment, according to the counter-extremism think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, Hamza — who resided in a maximum-security cell, but not solitary confinement — was able to communicate with fellow prisoners and even deliver sermons, without attracting the attention of warders, by banging on the pipes.

There are no pipes with which to talk to any of the other 250 inmates at the Supermax. And though there are plenty of other Islamic extremists, including some he inspired, Hamza wouldn’t be fraternising with them.

Prisoners live in virtual isolation, confined 23 hours a day under tight lockdown conditions in tiny cells. In  each, there is only a concrete bed and thin mattress, an immovable concrete desk and stool, a combined lavatory, sink and drinking fountain, and — if he is lucky — a small black and white TV showing educational and religious programmes.

A 4in wide window, little more than an arrow slit, looks out on to an inner courtyard, but only shows the roof and sky to prevent prisoners working out their location for an escape.

Inmates exercise in a concrete pit resembling an empty swimming pool, also designed to stop them working out where they are in the building. Communication with the outside world is severely limited under restrictions known as SAMs, or Special Administration Measures.

A prisoner such as Hamza would be able to communicate with only a handful of other inmates, while personal phone calls would be restricted to select family members and are always monitored.

Lawyers warn that Hamza’s family — his wife is still living in a £1 million council house in London — may not be allowed into the U.S. to see him.

Previous inmates have nothing good to say about the Supermax. In letters to a local newspaper, convicted bomber Eric Rudolph complained that the regime is intended to ‘inflict pain and misery’. Conditions — particularly the isolation and sensory deprivation — have prompted six suicides and hundreds of hunger-strike protests, most recently by shoebomber Richard Reid.

And in June, a lawsuit on behalf of mentally ill prisoners there claimed some were so disturbed they were swallowing razor blades, smearing faeces around their cells  and banging their heads against walls for hours on end.

Other Supermax residents include 9/11 architect Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called Unabomber Ted Kaczynski — who murdered three people and injured many others — and five Al Qaeda terrorists convicted of the 1988 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.

Alun Jones QC, the lawyer who represented Hamza in his tortuous extradition proceedings, has been trying to elicit sympathy for his client, whom he says has diabetes, psoriasis and high blood pressure.

Chiding Britain for not trying Hamza itself on some of the charges he faces in the U.S., he has trotted out the standard line of lawyers defending notorious clients that ‘a test of a civilised society is how it treats people it despises’.

In which case, as Hamza is about to discover, America is considerably less civilised than Britain.
