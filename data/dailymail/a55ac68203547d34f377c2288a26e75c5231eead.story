A NHS nurse who worked 19-hour days 
with moonlight shifts at a steel plant said she had to work the marathan
hours to pay for her son's university education.

Diane Davies, 55, is accused of endangering patients lives by her marathon working days for 12 years.

But Davies told how she took on the extra shifts as a steelworks nurse after becoming the sole breadwinner for her family.

She is accused of breaking NHS rules by working 19-hour days for 12 years, leaving her 'too tired' to properly care for patients.

'Too tired': NHS nurse Diane Davies (pictured yesterday) drove straight from night shifts at a
Llanelli steelworks to her job at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, the 
court heard

Davies would drive home when 
her shift ended at 5pm only to start the routine all over again at the 
steel plant five hours later, functioning on barely any sleep.

Health
chiefs were unaware the nurse was holding down two full-time jobs. The 
court heard Davies' 12 years of night shifts had boosted her income by 
up to £28,000 per year on top of her NHS salary.

The
court was told Davies worked from 10pm to 7am as an agency nurse at a 
steelworks, before driving to Swansea's Morriston Hospital for 8.15am to
put in a near nine hour shift on the ward.

But she told a jury she did what she 
had to so to 'survive' and took on the punishing workload with two 
full-time jobs after her husband Ken lost his employment.

She said: 'I did what I had to do to survive.

'I was putting my son through university at the time so money was very very tight.

'My husband lost his job so we lost a wage.

'It was very important for me to put my son through university and things were bad.'

Davies is accused of putting patients' lives at risk because she was too tired to care for them properly.

She worked from 10pm to 7am as an 
agency nurse at a steelworks, before driving to Swansea's Morriston 
Hospital for 8.15am to put in a near nine hour shift on the ward.

Davies would drive home when her 
shift ended at 5pm only to start the routine all over again at the 
Trostre steel plant in Llanelli, West Wales.

Punishing: Between her jobs at Trostre steelworks and Morriston Hospital (pictured), Davies put in a working week of between 77 and 82 hours, the prosecution claims

The nurse told a jury that her role 
at the steelworks as a 'babysitting' shift and she was able to sleep for
'about six hours' while on the job.

She said: 'After I finished at the hospital my husband would cook dinner, I'd watch telly or have a sleep then go to Trostre.

'They employed 600 at the steelworks,
it was heavy industry so they had a nurse 24/7 but the nurse on a night
shift wasn't really needed.'

'My role was to baby sit the plant at night.

'I'd do a hand over from the day 
nurse, clean up, stock up dressing trollies, make notes for the 
following day's duties and that was my role finished so I'd sleep.

'I couldn't have worked two jobs if I didn't have any sleep, so I slept.

'I never worked straight through two shifts, I slept at Trostre.

'If I was disturbed I woke up and dealt with that but that was the nature of the work.

'You can't sit in a chair for eight hours and not fall asleep.'

'If Davies had disclosed her full-time second job it would most definitely not have been allowed'

Julian Quirke, senior HR manager at Morriston Hospital

 

Swansea Crown Court heard how health chiefs were unaware the nurse was holding down two full-time jobs.

The court heard Davies' 12 years of night shifts had boosted her income by up to £28,000 per year on top of her NHS salary.

But Davies claimed she had informed 
her line manager at the hospital she was working a second full-time job 
at the steelworks - but he 'had not been concerned'.

She said: 'As he'd never placed any priority on it I didn't think it would be an issue with anyone else.
'I thought I was doing the right thing.'

Davies told the jury her work at the 
hospital was managerial not not clinical - from 2003 she was appointed 
junior sister and later sister.

She said she would 'never' be involved in clinical procedures and did not distribute drugs or remove stitches from patients.

Prosecutor Kristian Jowett said: 'She was obliged to disclose her second job to the NHS but she didn't do that.

'Nurses are required to disclose secondary employment to their employers to ensure safe practice.'

The prosecution claims she had a working week of between 77 and 82 hours spread over four days.

The court heard Davies' contract at Morriston Hospital was for a minimum of 37-and-a-half hours each week.

During her employment at the steelworks through Acorn Recruitment, she worked between 40 and 45 hours a week.

She is accused of doing both jobs four days of the week, breaking the rules of her contract with the NHS.

Julian Quirk, a senior human resources manager at the hospital, said: 'Working the hours Davies did would be almost impossible.

'It would be illogical for someone to
work so many hours back-to-back. There simply would not be sufficient 
time for the individual to have rest.'

'If Davies had disclosed her full-time second job it would most definitely not have been allowed.

'If somebody was working 19 hours a day, I cannot imagine a manager not saying that would represent a risk.'

The
court heard how that during the 12 years at the steelworks Davies was 
paid between £8,471 and £28,238 each year in addition to her NHS salary.

Davies,
of Birchgrove, Swansea, denies putting patient safety at risk and 
obtaining a financial advantage by failing to disclose her second job.

The experienced nurse claims she thought the hospital knew about her other employment and that she 'never hid it'.

Davies,
who received no complaints regarding her clinical duty, has now 
resigned from her role at the hospital, where she worked since 1994.

The trial continues.
