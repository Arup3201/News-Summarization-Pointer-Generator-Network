A grandmother sentenced to death by firing squad for smuggling cocaine into Bali has told Indonesian officials she intends to appeal against the ruling.

Lindsay Sandiford, 56, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was convicted of taking 10.6lb (4.8kg) of the Class A drug into the country.

The court said she had shamed Bali’s tourism 
reputation by smuggling the cocaine in the lining of her suitcase 
through the island’s international airport.

She received the sentence despite prosecutors only asking for a 15-year jail term.

A court official confirmed his office had received the appeal request through the head of Kerobokan Penitentiary where Sandiford is being held.

Earlier it was announced that the British government is to be challenged over its failure to fund legal representation for Sandiford, who is presumed not to be able to afford legal representation for the appeal.

Law firm Leigh Day, which is working with the charity Reprieve, said it would cost around £2,500 to pay for an adequate lawyer to take on her case, but the Government will not pay.

The firm said Sandiford had not been properly represented since her arrest at Bali airport in May last year.

A spokesman said: ‘We strongly object to the death penalty and continue to provide consular assistance to Lindsay and her family during this difficult time.

‘We have made repeated representations to the Indonesia authorities and the Foreign Secretary raised Lindsay Sandiford's case with Dr RM Marty Natalegawa, Indonesian foreign minister, during the recent November State Visit of the Indonesian President. We understand that, under Indonesian law, Lindsay has at least two further avenues of appeal through the courts as, well as an opportunity to apply for presidential clemency should these be unsuccessful.

‘HMG does not provide legal representation for British nationals overseas. However, we assist British nationals in identifying potential legal representation, including by working closely with NGOs. We will continue to raise this case on diplomatic channels.’

Following the call for a judicial review into Sandiford's case, Cheltenham MP Martin Horwood has urged the Foreign Office to rethink its policy on support for Britons sentenced to death abroad.

The British grandmother is being kept in Kerobokan jail in Bali, Indonesia. A court official confimed his office had received the appeal request from the prison

He said: ‘Indonesia itself now pays for lawyers to represent its migrant workers facing the death penalty in countries like Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and China.

‘I don't think it's unreasonable for Britons abroad to expect the same kind of support from their own government in this kind of extreme and unusual situation.’

The MP met Foreign Office officials last week to ask them to support her search for urgent legal representation, and he is due to meet the Indonesian ambassador today to discuss the legal process in Indonesia.

Sandiford is originally from 
Redcar on Teesside but married and moved to London, and later lived in 
Gloucestershire before leaving for India several years ago.

She is one of 12 Britons currently facing the death penalty abroad, according to the Foreign Office.
