Mothers are using their newborn babies as an excuse to let themselves go and avoid exercise, according to this tough love personal trainer.

Sydney-based trainer Allan Trinh believes new mums prioritise their kids over themselves and they end up missing out health-wise.

'They're letting go, they're not eating properly and they just don't care,' Mr Trinh told Daily Mail Australia.

'I don't think that's right. You have to be a role model to the kids.'

The 24-year-old mobile personal trainer said he expected to 'cop a lot of slack from mums' over his controversial stance but he was more concerned about his message.

'The three main excuses I hear are 'I'm too tired, I've got no time and my kids are my workout',' he said.

'I know mums are really busy and haven't had much sleep, but it's all about the kids and they don't prioritise themselves anymore.

'Before I start with them they're a mess, but how they come out of it is completely new women.'

He said new mums let themselves go, don't eat properly and just don't care because their children are the main priority

Mr Trinh, who has run Personal Direct Training in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney for almost four years, says a large proportion of his business are mums.

'I'm not a parent but I've been into the homes of a lot of mums - I've seen their lifestyles and the way they eat,' he said.

'I do sympathise with them. I will never go through pregnancy but I want to make a difference (with their health).'

Mr Trinh said mums needed ­energy and only exercise could help with that.

'They can push the baby in the pram or do a quick exercise program at home... anything that they can do,' he said.

'It has to be convenient and consistent for a new mum who only has spare time here and there.'
