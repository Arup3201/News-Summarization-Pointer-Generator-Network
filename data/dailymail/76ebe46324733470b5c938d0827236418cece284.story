Things turned ugly during a closely fought high school basketball game in Texas when members of the crowd unveiled provocative signs proclaiming 'White Power.'

Fans of home team Flower Mound flashed the offensive signs during their heated triple-overtime victory over rivals Plano East on Friday.

'We thought it was racist,' said a Plano East student athlete who was at the game and asked not to be identified. '(The sign) said 'white power,' and we were shocked.'

Witnesses said the incident happened late in the game when both student sections were hyped up as the scoring lead switched several times.

But the Plano East athlete remembers a specific moment when it got very raucous in the gym.

'Our student section started pointing at the sign,' the player told WFAA8.

'That's when it clicked into everyone's mind… 'Whoa... what are these guys doing?' And the teachers came and took the signs down.'

The student said the signs were held up for 30 seconds before teachers rushed to remove them.

However the provocative gesture was photographed and shared on social media by angry players and fans.

Flower Mound's coach Eric Littleton responded on Twitter to the image of the sign saying it was 'unacceptable'

'This is ridiculous,' tweeted one Plano player. 'I thought we passed the racial stage of society.'

Witnesses claim racial slurs were also directed at players during the game, especially after a player had been injured.

Angry Plano students also told a local TV station that someone urinated and defecated on their team's bus, although neither team has confirmed it.

Flower Mound's coach, Eric Littleton, responded on Twitter to the  sign describing it as  'unacceptable.' 

'As head coach at FMHS I offer our full voice apology. I will pursue this fully. No place for this,' he tweeted.

The Lewisville Independent School District, which oversees Flower Mound, has promised a full investigation.

'I want to be clear that this type of incident — however it has been perceived — has not and will not be tolerated in LISD,' Interim Superintendent Kevin Rogers said in a statement.

'We have always had high expectations for our more than 53,000 students and hold them to those standards both in and outside of the classroom.'
