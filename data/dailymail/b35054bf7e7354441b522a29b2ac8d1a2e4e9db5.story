This death-defying leap could leave even the most seasoned thrill-seekers feeling a little shaken or stirred.

For more than £125 a pop, people with an adventurous streak can bungee jump off an iconic Swiss dam and replicate the opening scene of GoldenEye.

Since the film was released in 1995, daredevils and James Bond fans have been flocking to the 720-ft tall Contra Dam to follow in the footsteps of the fictional MI6 agent.

The arch dam on the Verzasca River in Ticino, Switzerland is where actor Pierce Brosnan made his stunning debut as 007 in the film.

The actual onscreen bungee jump, however, was performed by British stuntman Wayne Michaels. 

It was named the best movie stunt of all time in a Sky Movies poll in 2002, and there is a constant queue of adrenaline junkies who are looking to recreate the stunt.

The dam, built in the 1960s, has been featured in a number of films and television shows from around the globe.
