A ruthless commander fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq has been ridiculed by activists online after a photograph emerged of him wearing camouflage that made him look like a doner kebab.

The photograph shows notorious ISIS commander Abu Wahib standing next to a black van somewhere in Iraq's Anbar province while wearing distinctive brown military fatigues.

The rotund 28-year-old general's stance and unusually-coloured outfit was immediately compared to a doner kebab by members of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered, the anti-ISIS activist group based in the terrorist organisation's de facto capital.

Easily confused: Islamic State commander Abu Wahib's unusually-coloured military fatigues (right) were immediately compared to a doner kebab (left) by anti-ISIS activists on social media

Notorious: Abu Wahib is one of the Islamic State terror group's most recognisable commanders thanks to his thick black beard and single eyebrow

Taking to Twitter to mock the Islamic State commander, RIBSS' Abu Mohammed shared the photograph of Abu Wahib alongside an image of a large doner kebab cooking on a rotating spit. 

He captioned the photograph '#same', much to the amusement of the followers of his anti-ISIS activist organisation. 

It is far from the first time Abu Wahib has been mocked on social media.

Since rising to prominence for the sickening filmed murder of three Syrian lorry drivers in Iraq's Anbar province in the summer of 2013, the militant became one of the terror group's most recognisable commanders thanks to his thick black beard and single eyebrow.

Anti-ISIS satirists have subsequently edited images of the hirsute Sunni extremist to make it look as if he is the star of shampoo commercials or appearing on a dating website.

Leader: Despite only being 28-years-old, Abu Wahib (centre) is the long term commander of a militia known as the Al-Anbar Lions (pictured), who control vast swathes of territory in central Iraq on behalf of ISIS

Distinctive: Although Abu Wahib currently has a $500,000 bounty on his head, new photographs of the hirsute commander regularly appear online - and are usually quickly mocked by anti-ISIS campaigners

Despite  only being 28-years-old, Abu Wahib is the long term  commander of a militia known as the Al-Anbar Lions, who control vast swathes of territory in central Iraq on behalf of ISIS.

Although he currently has a $500,000 bounty on his head, new photographs of the commander regularly appear online - and are usually quickly mocked by anti-ISIS campaigners.

The terrorist is understood to have been first drawn to terrorism while studying computer science at the University of Anbar and was arrested for links to Al Qaeda in 2006. 

Abu Wahib was held by US forces at the Camp Bucca detention facility in southern Iraq until 2009, when he was sentenced to death and moved to Tikrit Central Prison in Saladin Province.

A prison riot led by members of Al Qaeda in Iraq - the forerunner or ISIS - led to Abu Wahib and 109 other Sunni extremists escaping and seeking sanctuary among the terror group's leadership.

The following year Abu Wahib was filmed leading a group of militants as they pulled over three Syrian lorries travelling through Iraqi desert. He was filmed accusing them of being Shia Muslims before brutally executing them at the side of the road.
