A police officer claims she was fired after trying to stop a fellow cop from abusing a suspect.

Cariol Horne of Buffalo, New York says that Officer Gregory Kwiatkowski was choking and punching a suspect who was already handcuffed after responding to a report of a domestic disturbance.

What's more, Horne says that Kwiatkowski punched her in the face when she tried to stop him from assaulting the man - and she ended up getting fired.

The incident happened on November 1, 2006 when Kwiatkowski and Horne were at the home of Neal Mack, a black man, after receiving a report of a domestic disturbance between him and his girlfriend.

Horne claims when she entered the home Mack had already been handcuffed by Kwiatkowski.

'He was handcuffed in the front and he was sideways and being punched in the face by Gregory Kwiatkowski,' she told WKBW. 

'Gregory Kwiatkowski turned Neal Mack around and started choking him. So then I'm like, "Greg! You're choking him," because I thought whatever happened in the house he was still upset about so when he didn't stop choking him I just grabbed his arm from around Neal Mack's neck.

It was then that she claims Kwiatkowski assaulted her.

'He comes up and punches me in the face and I had to have my bridge replaced,' she said.

Then, in a shocking turn of events, Horne was fired and charged with obstruction.

She appealed her case repeatedly but lost each time, finding herself out of work after 19 years on the force.

Now, the mother of five works as a truck driver.

Kwiatkowski, who is now retired, was recently indicted on federal civil rights violations for an incident involving as group of black teenagers that occurred in  2009.

According to U.S. Attorney William J. Hochul Jr., Kwiatkowski and two other officers shot a young black teenager with a BB gun after he had already been handcuffed and put in  the squad car.

The charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

Horne's case meanwhile has been sent to the New York State retirement system for review.
