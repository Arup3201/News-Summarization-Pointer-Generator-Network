Chelsea are favourites to agree terms with Brazilian starlet Kenedy after his club Fluminense agreed to sell his economic rights to Giuliano Bertolucci's agency.

Bertolucci looks after Oscar, Willian and Ramires.

Another advantage for Chelsea is that the forward is represented by former Portugal international Deco, who spent two seasons playing at Stamford Bridge.
