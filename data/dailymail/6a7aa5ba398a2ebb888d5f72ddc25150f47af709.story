A nursing home resident has been arrested for murder after he allegedly bludgeoned his elderly roommate to death with part of a wheelchair on Wednesday.

Thomas Yarnavick was arrested over the attack on his 71-year-old roommate at a New York nursing home.

Police said an ongoing argument over a curtain that separated the men's beds escalated into the brutal attack.

'It's as if you live in a small, 
tight-knit town, and you wake up to incredibly tragic news. This is like
a small town,' Aaron Lichtman, a spokesman for the Beacon Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in the Rockaways, said.

Yarnavick, 66, had been roommates with his unnamed victim since September and staff said there had been no warning signs or obvious problems between them.

Mr Lichtman said staff at the nursing home, which was badly damaged during Superstorm Sandy last year, had never witnessed such violence.

The attack happened at about 1.30am. An employee who discovered the distressing scene called police.

The 71-year-old victim had serious head injuries and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

It is not yet known if the wheelchair used in the attack belonged to Yarnavick or his victim.

Yarnavick, who is facing murder and weapons charges, was taken into custody and is awaiting arraignment in Queens.

Psychologists and grief counselors have been made available to other residents in the home, which can house up to 120 people.

'There is a lot of work to do to help these residents. We are all grieving, the employees, too,' Mr Lichtman said.

The nursing home, which is on the Rockaways broadwalk, was badly affected by Sandy last year.

Requests for the home to be evacuated were denied, meaning residents remained in the building as seawater crashed through the first floor.

They lived in the soaked, sand-filled building for several days afterwards, with the lights running on emergency generators, until the state gave a mandatory evacuation order as a snowstorm approached.
