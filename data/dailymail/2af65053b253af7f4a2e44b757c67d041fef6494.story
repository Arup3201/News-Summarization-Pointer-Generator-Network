Three young women are speaking to police after allegedly going on a shopping spree with a stolen credit card.

The women, aged in their late teens and early 20s, contacted police after CCTV footage of them shopping up a storm on the Mornington Peninsula, south of Melbourne, hit social media on Friday morning.

The images were released by Victoria Police in a bid to track them down.

It's alleged by police that the women found a lost card at a Rosebud shopping centre and then used it at shops in the complex and in the Rye CBD on New Year's Day.

Security cameras at the shopping centre captured the four well dressed women.

The three women are now speaking police, while the fourth woman is yet to speak with investigators.
