This is the moment an RAF Typhoon closes in on a Russian surveillance plane after it flew close to UK airspace, before making it turn back.

The photograph of the Russian Tu-95 'Bear H' was taken from one of the RAF's Quick Reaction Aircraft after two Russian planes were spotted off the coast of north-east Scotland.

However, the aircraft turned away after the British jet fighters, one which can be seen approaching the Russian plane from above, took off from Leuchars airbase, near St Andrews in Fife yesterday.

Spotted: RAF Typhoon Quick Reaction Alert aircraft were launched from RAF Leuchars to determine the identity of the unknown aircraft as approached the NATO Air Policing Area north of Scotland

Planes were launched by the RAF to determine the identity of two unknown aircraft seen approaching the NATO Air Policing Area north of Scotland, which could not be identified by other means.

The aircraft were later identified as Russian Bears, which the Ministry of Defence said remained in international airspace, as they are entitled to do.

Incidents of foreign planes flying close to UK airspace are surprisingly common - with eight similar occurrences reported last year, according to the Ministry of Defence.

A spokesman from the MoD said that Russian military flights have never entered UK sovereign airspace without authorisation.

Monitoring: Defence experts say Russia uses such surveillance flights to remind the world of its military might and to probe other countries' air defence systems

Defence experts say Russia uses such surveillance flights to remind the world of its military might and to probe other countries' air defence systems.

The incident comes as international tensions heighten over the Ukraine situation, after last month's annexation of Crimea by Russia.

Typhoon Pilot Flight Lieutenant Gary Montgomery, of 6 Squadron, said: 'Typhoon Quick Reaction Alert stands ready to scramble at a moments notice, 24/7, all year long, to maintain the integrity of UK airspace.

Identified: The aircraft were later identified as Russian Bears, which the Ministry of Defence said remained in international airspace, as they are entitled to do

'We scrambled on 23 April to intercept two unknown aircraft approaching the NATO Air Policing Area from the north.

'We intercepted and flew within visual range and identified them as Russian Tu-95 "Bear H" aircraft.

'We
 monitored their progress, including handing them over to Danish F-16 
QRA aircraft as the Bears flew towards Denmark, then continued to 
monitor them as they returned.'

Jet: An RAF Typhoon, similar to the ones scrambled yesterday. Pilots say the planes are on constant alert, and ready to deploy at a moment's notice
