Patriots fans can’t get rid of their Aaron Hernandez jerseys fast enough.Fans began lining up at Gillette Stadium hours before the pro shop opened Saturday morning after the team announced they would exchange Aaron Hernandez jerseys for any other jersey free of charge. Over 500 jerseys were exchanged in the first 90 minutes alone, according to multiple reports.The unprecedented move was announced last week by the Patriots after the star player was released in the wake of being arrested and accused of murdering a friend.

Moving on: Patriots fans lined up by the hundreds to exchange their Aaron Hernandez jerseys for any other player free of charge

‘They're going to lose a lot of money on this, but that's what makes it one of the best organizations definitely in the NFL," Mike Vitelli told the Boston Globe.Fans echoed Vitelli’s sentiment, saying that the team is doing the right thing.‘I think it’s a great thing the team is doing,’ Andrew Keating told the Globe, ‘What [Hernandez] did was a pretty awful thing.’

Classy move: The Patriots are offering a new jersey to all fans who want to get rid of the one they bought with Hernandez's name

Trade: This fan wore his Aaron Hernandez jersey to the trade-in, there was no word on whether he wore his new jersey out of the pro shop

The jersey exchange comes on the heels of yet another search of a Hernandez property in the past few days, according to reports.The latest property to be searched in connection with the murder of Odin Lloyd has been characterized in reports as a ‘flop house’ rented by the player for a mere $1,200 a month.Details released this week of that search, conducted June 26, were pretty grim.

Investigators are said to have found 11 boxes of ammunition, a bag from Kay Jewelers, paychecks from both the Patriots and Puma, a valet receipt from a downtown Boston hotel, a Hertz rental agreement – a rental car in Hernandez’s name was found in the vicinity of Lloyd’s body – a Western Union receipt and two set of keys to a brand new Hummer in the disgraced star’s name, according to the Boston Herald. The search warrant also reportedly indicated cops were looking for cocaine, but there is no evidence of any drugs being found during the search.

Gone: The Patriots are trying to help fans move on from their fallen star by offering a free jersey bearing any other player's name in exchange for a Hernandez jersey.

Also, authorities are examining Hernandez’s tattoos, of which he has many, for signs of any past or present gang affiliations.Two associates of the accused murderer have been arrested and officials are also looking into possible involvement in a double murder in Boston last summer, according to reports.‘I think it’s a good idea, and it gives everyone a chance to wear a player that they are pretty proud of,’ Marta Hernandez later added.The most popular jersey so far has been defensive lineman Vince Wilfork, according to the Herald. Star quarterback Tom Brady and linebacker Chandler Jones were close behind. The exchange runs through the weekend.It's not clear what the team plans to do with the unwanted Hernandez jerseys, multiple attempts by Mail Online to reach a Patriots spokesperson were unsuccessful.
