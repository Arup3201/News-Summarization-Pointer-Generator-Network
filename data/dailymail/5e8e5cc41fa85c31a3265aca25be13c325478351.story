According to local folk stories, the 
people who live in the area moved from the plains in central China to 
mountainous Guizhou Province many centuries ago to avoid war.

One legend maintains that because 
they hoped to one day move back to their homeland they didn’t bury their
dead but instead stacked their coffins in the caves.

According
to other stories the tradition started because the area is often 
subject to floods and the coffins were stored in caves to prevent them 
from being affected.

Being in caves also means that the coffins are closer to the sky and therefore closer to heaven.
