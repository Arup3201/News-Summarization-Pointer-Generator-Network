Summer has arrived at last and sun-deprived Britons have been flocking to the country's beaches to bask in soaring temperatures after enduring weeks of soggy weather.

But not everyone will be welcoming the respite from the rain. The sudden change in weather has come with an unfortunate side effect for hay fever sufferers - soaring pollen counts.

The seemingly endless weeks of rain in the UK since spring have seen pollen-bearing grasses and weeds flourish.

The tiny particles spread easily on humid days, and the current hot spell has seen an increase in the amount of pollen in the air.

Lindsey McManus, from Allergy UK, said hay fever sufferers might see their symptoms flare up after the sudden change in weather.

'Because the weather has been so up and down people might be thinking they had got away with it,' she said, explaining that wet weather keeps levels of pollens that trigger hay fever lower.

'When it's warm weather, and it's a little bit breezy, (symptoms) are going to really kick in,' she said.

'Things like weeds and grasses and trees are all pollinated by the wind, and (the particles) are really small so winds carry them long distances.'

Britain's estimated 16 million hay fever sufferers have already been warned that the chaotic weather could see the country's hay fever season last up to a month longer than usual.

The season normally ends in July, but experts have said the freak weather could leave sufferers enduring sneezing fits, sore throats and watery eyes well into August.

At the beginning of the month NHS Direct reported a 20 per cent increase in calls from hay fever sufferers during the early summer months compared to the same period in 2011.

Patrick Sachon, health manager at the Met Office, said the settled, drier weather would be reflected in boosted pollen counts.

'The
unsettled weather this summer has led to a fluctuating pollen count but
as expected we have seen some very high levels when the weather has 
been good,' he added.

With people all over the country revelling in the glorious sunshine, it would be easy to forget that less than a fortnight ago large swathes of Britain remained on flood alert after persistent heavy downpours at the start of the month followed the wettest April to June period on record.

Around 3,000 homes and businesses were flooded and people were swept to their deaths as Britain was battered by rain for weeks on end.

The wet weather also saw roads closed off, cars marooned in flood water, and rivers bursting their banks.

Even this month rainfall has hit 71.8mm, above the typical 69.6mm July average.

Such sodden scenes may seem a distant
memory today, as the south of England enjoys more blue skies and 
blazing sunshine, but forecasters have warned the heatwave is not 
expected to last past the weekend.

Lucky
folks with a ticket for the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in Stratford,
East London, tomorrow, will be hoping the spectacular summer weather 
will hold. But the Met Office has said there is a 50/50 chance of 
showers tomorrow evening, and a 20 per cent chance they will be heavy.
