North Korea is continuing to stoke tensions with a fourth nuclear missile test, which comes as the regime may be looking to carry out war on a different battlefield - the internet.

South Korea's point man on North Korea, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae, 
told a parliamentary committee today that 'there is such an 
indication' that the country is preparing to launch another test missile, according to two ministry officials who spoke on condition 
of anonymity.

Ryoo was answering a lawmaker's question about increased personnel and vehicle activities at the North's nuclear test site.

Provocative act: North Korea is said to be preparing a fourth nuclear missile test, a new incendiary action amid tensions with South Korea and the U.S.

Ministry officials cite Ryoo as 
telling the lawmakers he wouldn't provide further details because they 
involve confidential intelligence affairs.

South Korean defense officials 
previously said the North completed preparations for a nuclear test at 
two underground tunnels. The North used one tunnel for its February 12 
nuclear test.

The second remains unused.

North Korea has unleashed a flurry of war 
threats and provocations over the U.N. sanctions and ongoing U.S.-South 
Korean military drills, which the allies say are routine but Pyongyang 
says is a preparation for a northward invasion

The Pentagon has strengthened missile 
defenses and made other decisions to combat the potential threat.

U.S. 
Gen Martin Dempsey, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said yesterday 
that he doesn't believe North Korea will engage in military action soon,
'but I can't take the chance that it won't.'

Threats: Kim Jong Un's regime may be preparing to launch cyber attacks against the South and the U.S.

Dempsey said the U.S. has been preparing 
for further provocations or action, 'considering the risk that they may 
choose to do something' on one of two nationally important anniversaries
- April 15, the birth of North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, and April 
25, the creation of the North Korean army.

Meanwhile, Kim Jong Un's regime may be preparing to launch cyber attacks against the South and the U.S.

North Korea, which has a reported 3,000 hackers in its cyberterrorism network, is believed to have been targeting various South Korean media and banking sites in recent weeks.

Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for The Heritage Foundation’s Asian Studies Center, told The Daily Caller: 'Defectors from the unit told South Korean intelligence officials that North Korea sends hackers to other countries for training as well as to conduct undercover operations.'

Klingner added that the North has 'very strong cyberterrorism capabilities.'

Seoul and Washington are taking the 
threats seriously, though they say they have seen no signs that 
Pyongyang is preparing for a large-scale attack.

In addition, the U.S. said last week 
that two of the Navy's missile-defense ships were moved closer to the 
Korean Peninsula, and a land-based missile-defense system is being 
deployed to the Pacific territory of Guam later this month.

The Pentagon
last month announced longer-term plans to strengthen its U.S.-based 
missile defenses.

The U.S. military also is 
considering deploying an intelligence drone at the Misawa Air Base in 
northern Japan to step up surveillance of North Korea, a Japanese 
Defense Ministry official said Sunday.

Three Global Hawk surveillance 
planes are deployed on Guam and one of them is being considered for 
deployment in Japan, the official said on condition of anonymity because
the official was not authorized to speak about the issue.

North Korea successfully shot a 
satellite into space in December and conducted its third nuclear test in
February.

It has threatened to launch a nuclear attack on the United 
States, though many analysts say the North hasn't achieved the 
technology to manufacture a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could fit 
on a long-range missile capable of hitting the U.S.
