Mama June is lying when she says she has not rekindled her relationship with sex offender Mark McDaniel, Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson has said.

In an interview with Dr Phil on Tuesday, Uncle Poodle said he had seen her kissing McDaniel, who was released from prison in March - 10 years after her daughter Anna accused him of molesting her. 

He added that, despite June's claims, images of her and McDaniel have not been photoshopped - and insisted that he had seen them in bed together with her nine-year-old daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo', during a recent trip to North Carolina.

'She tells everyone that [she and Mark] haven't seen each other and that the photos are photo shopped,' he told Dr Phil. 'It's a big lie.'

Speaking out: Honey Boo Boo's uncle Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson has claimed he saw McDaniel and Mama June together, and heard her boasting about having sex with him while on a trip to North Carolina

After the interview, Uncle Poodle flew to Los Angeles for a polygraph test.

It revealed that he was telling the truth about seeing Mama June, McDaniel and Alana in bed together during the weekend trip to a North Carolina casino in September.

He explained that he and his husband had been sharing a room with June, McDaniel and Alana on the weekend trip and awoke to see them in bed, with June in the middle.

At one point at the weekend, McDaniel and June went off together and she returned and - in front of Alana - and described how they had just had sex.

'It got graphic,' he told Dr Phil.

Uncle Poodle said that by the time they took the trip, he knew McDaniel was a sex offender so wanted to go to ensure that Alana was safe.

He said that he first met him when he drove Mama June to a house viewing on September 9, and disputed her claim that she did not know McDaniel would be there.

When Uncle Poodle returned home, he asked a police friend to run McDaniel's name - and learned he was a sex offender.

'Why would you take your child in front of him knowing that he molested your child?' he said. 'It ticked me off.'

He added that Child Protective Services had interviewed him and that he had told them what he had seen, and shared with them photographs he had taken.

The interview with Uncle Poodle came just a day after Mama June spoke to Dr Phil. 

The 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' matriarch insisted that she had no idea that her daughter Anna had been molested by her former boyfriend until two years ago.   

'Anna did not tell me, my mother didn't tell me what he was accused of,' June claimed. 'I didn't hear Anna's side of the story until she moved in with me two and a half years ago.'

Denial: Mama June appeared on an interview with Dr Phil on Monday and answered questions about her reported relationship with the man accused of molesting her daughter. She denied they were together

She said that even when McDaniel was arrested and in jail, no one would tell her why he was locked up - including the police and the jail staff.

But she admitted that she didn't do enough to protect the girl, who told police that she was molested repeatedly in 2002, sometimes while her little sister Pumpkin, then three, was beside her.

'I do in a way feel like I did fail to protect Anna, but I didn't know,' she told Dr Phil. 'And she admitted that too. I was at work when this happened so I knew nothing, and she never did come to me, anything, the whole time it was happening.'

She said that even when she did find out a couple of years ago, she was not sure what to believe. 

'A person I lived with five years, I don't know if he could do that,' she said. 'It was a shock. I wanted to talk to Anna to get her side of the story but I wasn't able to.' 

McDaniel ultimately pleaded guilty to child molestation and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Since he was released earlier this year, he has been pictured with Mama June and her kids.

But she denied anything was going on.

Accusations: Her oldest daughter Anna accused McDaniel of molesting her when she was just eight and has expressed her anger that her mother could have rekindled her relationship with the man

'I'm not in a relationship with Mark McDaniel,' she insisted. 'I have seen him twice [since he was released]. One time was by coincidence.'

She said that she happened to bump into him 'in the mountains' but that they ignored each other. Then in mid-September, she claims she went to give his son diapers and McDaniel was there.

Photographs were taken and leaked showing them smiling and walking around a house together with Honey Boo Boo. Mama June said these were from the accidental September meeting.

She said that the only words they exchanged at that meeting were, 'Hey, how ya doing?'

She also insisted that another image shared by TMZ and showing her in bed with McDaniel had been photoshopped, claiming that she had other very similar photos of herself on her computer.

TMZ said it stands by the integrity of their images '100 per cent'. 

Mama June, whose real name is June Shannon, claimed that she met with McDaniel the second time so that her daughter Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Thompson could get some closure.

Questions: One of Mama June's daughters, Pumpkin, said she had asked her mother if she could see McDaniel after his release from prison because she wanted to get closure, and her mother agreed

She said that McDaniel raised the girl, now 14, from when she was two months to when she was six years, and that Pumpkin had many questions about who he really was.

Pumpkin later appeared on the show and confirmed what her mother had claimed.

'I guess I wanted closure on actually who he was,' Pumpkin told Dr Phil. 'I wanted to actually know for sure if he did what he did.' 

But when faced with him, she didn't ask him about the molestation, she said, because she didn't feel like she could.

She added: 'If I knew it would blow up as big as it is now, I would never have asked.' 

She added that she no longer had a relationship with her sister Anna because she thinks she has chosen to believe gossip about their mother and McDaniel, rather than the family. 

'If we're supposed to be a family, why would you go by what someone else says and not listen to what your mama has to say?' she said. 

Mama June also claimed that she believes the recent scandal is only part of the reason why TLC canceled the show. She said she thinks her children were also getting 'wore down' by the filming.

David 'Sugar Bear' Thompson - Honey Boo Boo's father and Mama June's estranged husband - also revealed that he is living in the home, despite the separation.

But the couple insisted that they were not back together, and instead were just under the same roof for practical purposes in bringing their children up together.

'I didn't say we were going to get back together, but I know he wants to try to get his family back together,' Mama June said. 'Nobody ever knows the future.' 

The interview comes three weeks after the photos emerged showing Mama June and McDaniel together.

In another interview with Entertainment Tonight, Mama June revealed that she was also young when she started dating McDaniel, and indeed when she lost her virginity - at age 12.

'I had no idea what it was, how to whatever… and then it kind of escalated from there,' she explained.

'I was dating men who were in their 20s, 30s, my mom knew about it. I would kind of lie and say they were 21, 22. When me and Mark started dating, I was 20 and he was 38.'

Mama June's three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying Michael Cardwell.
