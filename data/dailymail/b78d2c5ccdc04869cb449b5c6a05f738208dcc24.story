In a double world record ride, a British thrillseeker is attempting to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the world and visit the most capital cities by motorcycle.

23 year old Rhys Lawrey, from Cambridge, is now on the New Zealand leg of his adventure, which was his home town as a youngster

He has so far travelled more than 30,000 kilometres and visited 21 countries over 133 days.

Riding a Triumph Tiger 800XC, the motorbike enthusiast is trying to raise money for The Prince Trust Charity, a youth charity that helps change the lives of young people in the UK and help them find work.

Watch out for the locals : 23 year old Rhys Lawrey (pictured) from London is attempting to navigate the world by motorbike. He recently completed his Australia leg and has now arrived in New Zealand. He has travelled more than 30,000 kilometres and visited over 21 countries in 133 days all for charity.

On the third of May, Rhys left London with the goal of travelling 80,000 kilometres, visiting 73 countries, 52 consecutive capital cities, and crossing six continents by June next year.

And he's well on his way, already at country number 22 - although still has 52 more countries to go and another 50,000 kilometres.

'It's quite mind blowing, I experience so much every day, today in the morning I went from crystal blue skies to jumping off a bridge,' said Rhys.

And the 23 year old is a thrillseeker indeed, having just completed one of New Zealand's famous bungie jumps.

'I'm pretty keen for thrilling things,' he said, 'I screamed quite loud, it made good footage.' 

While he admits to having a ball, the motorbike lover says his big adventure can get a little tiring although now in western countries it's a little bit easier.

He has just arrived in New Zealand and says there's been a few dramas with registering his bike on the road but he says that's now been sorted.

'Every country has it's difficulties.'

Reminiscing on his ride so far Rhys, who actually lived and worked in Brisbane back in 2013, said his most memorable moments are the people that he meets, particularly in Asia.

'It's quite amazing travelling and China is absolutely an amazing place beyond belief, everybody is friendly, even the military guards,' he said.

Getting into a muddy situation in China : 'It's quite amazing travelling and China is absolutely an amazing place beyond belief, everybody is friendly, even the military guards,' he said.

The climate is a big factor in his rides, going from one extreme to the next

He also says the most interesting thing about his trip is how the cultures work and how cultures lives their lives.

'We all live a very different life, it's funny to see it, i.e. in Asia seeing a family on a scooter is considered normal but in Australia those parents would be hung up for bad parenting. I had to sit back and laugh

One of his not so memorable moments was when he crashed in Turk Ministan. The 23 year old came off, but fortunately only suffered a few bruises.

'It was four to five in the afternoon, my water bottle was boiling hot, I was tired and then I came off and the bike landed on my right leg.'

'I was wearing proper gear though so the boots saved my leg, just a bruise,' he said.

He also described the country as not the most welcoming place to be. Staying overnight at the border he had to sleep on a table and got hassled by local police.

'In the capital Ashgabat I was with a couple of riders, one rider got told off from hotel security because he had his legs on the couch, they're just very strict and they don't like foreigners,' said Rhys.

The climate was also a big factor in his rides, going from one extreme to the next.

'There's nothing you can do about it but just get on with it. It's part of the motorcycling adventure, you have to live and breath it,' he said.

Rhys has also tried a number of interesting delicacies on his adventures from brains to ducks gums and neck and says he's probably even eaten a whole bunch of other foods but didn't even know what they were.

Rhys made plenty of friends in Asia : the 23 year old said China was one of the most friendliest countries

Rhys is trying to raise money for British charity, The Prince Trust who are a youth charity. He wants to raise as much as possible

The whole adventure is also raising money for British charity, The Prince Trust, chosen by Rhys because being a young person himself, he wanted to interlink with a youth charity.

He says fundraising is going OK at the moment but he would love a bit more, although hasn't had the time going through countries like Asia because he's been concentrating on surviving.

'I want to raise as much as possible, there's no goal because of the large scale of the project,' he said. 

2moroRider is partnered up with The Prince Trust Charity - to help raise funds which can also be donated through the JustGiving website and JustTextGiving by Vodafone.

In New Zealand now, the 23 year old still has 50,000 kilometres to rack up on his trusty Triumph

So far Rhys has seen a clean bill of help and is crossing his fingers that will continue.

The 23 year old also hasn't suffered any flat tyres and says his bike is still in top condition and just keeps going and going.

After four months on the road, he's still got plenty more to go and once he's finished in New Zealand in November he'll be bound for Los Angeles.

Rhys is hoping he'll reach the end of his massive adventure by June next year.

'I will finish, guaranteed, I'm determined.'
