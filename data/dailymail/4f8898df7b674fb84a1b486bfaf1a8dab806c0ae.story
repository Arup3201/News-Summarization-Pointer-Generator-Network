Police have identified a 22-year-old woman as a 'person of interest' in last week's slaying of an aspiring rapper who was shot and killed while driving his Maserati on the Las Vegas strip.

Police said Tineesha Lashun Howard was riding in a black Range Rover with prime suspect Ammar Harris when he opened fire on the Maserati being driven by 27-year-old Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr. before dawn on Thursday.

Cherry, who performed under the name 'Kenny Clutch,' was mortally wounded and his silver sports car veered out of control, colliding with a taxi in an intersection at the heart of the strip - killing the cab driver and his passenger.

Harris, 26, has been the subject of a multistate manhunt since the incident, and police say he has a long criminal history that includes arrests for robbery, sexual assault, kidnapping and soliciting prostitution.

Police believe Harris is 'involved in the sex trade,' said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police spokesman Officer Bill Cassell.

Harris is described as having several tattoos, including a large black-eyed owl on his neck and small heart on his upper right cheek.

Police officials described Howard as a 'missing and possibly endangered individual' from the Miami area.

'She's listed as a missing person,' Cassell said. 'How she went missing is part of the Miami Police Department's investigation.'

Several photos released by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department showed Howard and Harris together in each others' arms.

In one of them they are seen riding in a sport utility vehicle, possibly the Range Rover.

The Range Rover used in the shooting, which bore paper dealer plates, has been impounded by police, but officials have not said where they found the luxury sport utility vehicle.

No weapons were recovered from inside.

Earlier on Tuesday, Las Vegas taxicab companies pledged $35,000 toward a reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Harris.

Authorities say the dramatic shooting in a busy intersection of the desert resort city may have stemmed from a verbal altercation in the valet area of the Aria Resort and Casino a few blocks away on the Strip.

The new revelations came hours after a new picture of Harris was released as cops widen their manhunt.

Capt Chris Jones, of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, said: 'We have him identified. Now the focus is on locating and apprehending him. We're getting help all over the place.'

He is described as having several 
distinctive tattoos, including a large black-eyed owl on his neck and 
small heart on his upper right cheek.

Police have also revealed that Harris, an alleged pimp, has a length criminal history, which includes charges of sexual assault, kidnap and robbery.

The manhunt has been extended to the southeastern states, with police already searching Nevada, Arizona, California and Utah.

It follows the shootout early on Thursday at the junction of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, near several world famous casino resort hotels, including The Bellagio and Caesars Palace.

The driver of the taxi, Michael Bolden, 62, and his passenger, identified in local media reports as Sandi Sutton, from Washington state, were killed in an explosion after the Cherry's Maserati struck the vehicle.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said Harris is wanted for the murder of all three, and that officers were 'utilizing every available resource' to find him.

He warned yesterday that any members of the public 'harboring' Harris or helping him to evade the authorities could face charges themselves.

Lt Steiber said: 'At this point Ammar Harris is the one responsible for the shooting and the murder of three individuals.'

No weapons were found in the silver Maserati, police have confirmed, and Cherry, an aspiring rapper, did not return fire.

Lt Steiber added: 'Right now, as far as we're concerned, Mr Cherry, he's the victim of a murder and that's what we're focused on.'

Harris, who lived in South Carolina and Georgia, was convicted of marijuana possession in 2005 in Atlanta.

In December, he was arrested in Miami for reckless driving and failure to produce a valid license.

He also used the name Ammar Asim Faruq Harris when he was arrested last May in Las Vegas and charged with sexual assault, kidnapping and coercion with a weapon.

His apparently brand new Range Rover has been impounded, but police have declined to say where it was found. Steiber said no guns were found inside.

Authorities say the shooting may have stemmed from a verbal altercation in the valet area of the Aria Resort and Casino a few blocks away on the Strip.

It took place less than a mile from where rapper Tupac Shakur was shot in September 1996.

The 25-year-old had been riding in a BMW with Death Row Records co-founder Marion 'Suge' Knight after the two men had attended a Mike Tyson boxing match.
