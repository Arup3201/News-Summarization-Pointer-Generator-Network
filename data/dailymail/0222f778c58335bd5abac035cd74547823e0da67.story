Irma Zamora's husband told her not to get out of their vehicle
after approaching a car accident that smashed a fire hydrant and knocked a
light post into the water.

Hoping to help the victim inside the smashed SUV, the
40-year-old mother from Burbank, California insisted in an act of kindness that
cost her her life.

'I saw her step into the water. Her arms stiffened and she
fell flat on her back and it felt like it was going in slow motion,' witness
Christie Vergini told KTLA.

First responder: Irma Zamora, 40, was the first to run to help the car crash when she dashed into a pool of water tragically carrying 4,800 volts of electricity from a broken lamp post

Double tragedy: Seeing Mrs Zamora lying in the road with others unable to reach her, neighbour Stacey Schreiber, 39, dashed into the water too before also fatally electrocuted

Scene: An SUV that smashed into a fire hydrant sent this steady explosion of water into the street where horrified bystanders watched unable to help without being electrocuted

With the light post lying in the street's gushing water, it
sent a current of electricity estimated by firefighters at 4,800 volts into the
pooling street.

It shocked everyone who tried to help - in all, two fatally.

'We made an attempt to try to rescue the woman,' Gerome
Glassman told the station while fighting back tears. 'One by one each of us got
electrocuted. It flew me back. I ended up on all fours.'

Skyler Maxon who was with his twin brother at the time of
the crash, said his brother was hospitalized after his attempt to help, too.

Trying to help: Gerome Glassman, left, was one of several who tried to reach Mrs Zamora's body was was severely electricuted while, right, Skyler Maxon's twin brother was hospitalized for his attempts to help

Hospitalized: Skyler Maxon, seen with his brother, said that his twin reached out and grabbed Mrs Zamora but was severely electrocuted sending him to the hospital

'My brother grabbed her and tried to pull her out and that's
when he got hurt,' Maxon told KTLA.

That's around when witnesses say 39-year-old Stacey
Schreiber, who lived in an apartment nearby, also ran into the water.

'I kept telling her, pleading her, stay back it's a life
wire,' Mr Glassman said. 'Either she didn't hear me, and she dropped within
seconds. She dropped within seconds, there was nothing we could do.'

On the pool's edge, Mr Zamora's husband cried out at the
scene and had to be restrained by witnesses after he stepped into the water and
was mildly shocked himself.

Twelve-year-old DJ Vergini witnessed Mr Zamora's pleas.

Witnessing husband: Standing along the pool's edge, Mrs Zamora's husband had to be restrained from going after his wife whom he attempted to stop from trying to help the pictured SUV's passenger

'Please help my wife, please help my wife! I need help!' DJ
recalled to KTLA of the desperate man.

Both Mrs Zamora's body and Ms Schreiber's were removed from
the water by firefighters who used a 6-foot non-electricity conducting pole,
the Los Angeles Times reports.

'She saw someone hurt. The first thing on her mind was I'm
going to go help them,' Mrs Zamora's son told KTLA after his mother's death.

He said he knows that she's in a better place.

'She died like a hero,' Mrs Zamoraâ€™s sister Ana Aviles told
the Times.

Heartbreaking news: The sister of Mrs Zamora, whose seen pictured with her son, said that she was watching the crash on the news with other family members never realizing it was her

Mrs Aviles said she was watching the news with family when
she heard of the tragic accident, not knowing it was her sister lying in the
street.

'We never imagined it was her,' she said.

The 19-year-old driver of the SUV was allegedly speeding on
the road when he crashed.

Speaking for her brother identified as Arman Samsonian, his
sister Ani told CBS LA that he holds himself responsible for the deaths that
night, in a horrible accident he tried to help out in as well.

'He said that he saw her lying down, so he tried to help
her, and he got shocked, too,' his sister said while biting back tears.

Driver: The vehicle's driver Arman Samsonian, 19, right, was allegedly speeding when he crashed the vehicle in an accident his sister Ani, left, says he feels horrible for

'He told me to please get flowers and take it to the site.
He really feels bad for these poor women.'

Ani said that contrary to witness' reports, her brother
claims he was not street racing that night.

Samsonian could face reckless driving charges while a friend
of his seen driving behind or next to him before the crash is being questioned
as well.

'Everyone involved in this is going to be changed forever.
Nobody is going to look at life the same way,' Samsonian's sister said.
