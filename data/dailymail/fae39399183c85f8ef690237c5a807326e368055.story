A Fort Lauderdale police officer is facing possible criminal charges after he was filmed pushing and slapping a homeless man at a bus terminal.

A witness captured the moment Officer Victor Ramirez led Bruce Laclair, 58, away from the Broward County bus station before apparently becoming frustrated with him and pushing him to the ground.

From the floor, Laclair told the officer that he had hoped to use the restroom inside the station.

'I'm telling you right now what is going to happen,' Ramirez can be heard saying on the video. 'You're not supposed to go pee here.' 

Startling: A member of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, Vincent Ramirez, apparently pushes a homeless man, Bruce Laclair, to the ground after they exchanged words at a bus terminal at the weekend

Terrifying: Once on the ground, Laclair tells the officer he was there to use the restroom and the officer responds by slapping him so hard that a loud slap can be heard. The man filming gasps in horror

Laclair remains on the floor and does not raise his hands as Ramirez suddenly slaps him across the face, eliciting a shocked cry from the man behind the camera.

'I'm not f****** around with you!' Ramirez tells Laclair. 'Don't f****** touch me.'

He then arrests the homeless man for trespassing and hauls him away in cuffs.

Laclair spent 20 hours in jail before he was released on Monday. The man, who has been homeless for six months, told Local 10 News that he must pay $300 for court costs related to the charge.

He told the channel he was feeling bruised, 'pissed and in pain'.  

'I didn't touch him. I didn't get aggressive with him,' Laclair insisted. 'Then he pushed me to the ground. Then he punched me in the face.' 

On the ground: Laclair, 58, said he did not raise his hands to the officer before he was slapped

Cuffed: He was arrested for trespassing and spent the night in a cell before being released on Monday. The police department is now investigating the incident and Ramirez has been suspended with pay

Gerald Schorder, who saw the slap, agreed that he did not see Laclair raise his hands to the officer.

'The officer just knocked him down with his hands,' he said. 'The guy was defenseless.'

It is unclear what the men said before the witness started recording the altercation on his cell phone, but there are signs throughout the terminal warning people against loitering. 

The Fort Lauderdale Police Department has launched an internal investigation and Ramirez, a nine-year veteran of the department, has suspended with pay paid.

Police Chief Frank Adderley said at a press conference on Tuesday morning that they're looking into possible criminal charges against the officer. The agency will also review its use-of-force policy. 

Probe: Laclair, left, said he did not raise his hands to the officer and a witness, Gerald Schorder, right, agreed that he had not seen the man act aggressively towards the police officer

At the press conference, City Manager Lee Feldman, called the video 'clearly disturbing' and said it was 'not representative' of the police department.

'I'm not going to justify any of the officer's actions,' he told reporters.

'We are committed to doing the right thing - not only the right thing by the city but the right thing by the community.' 

The State Attorney's Office also is reviewing the incident, he said.
