England’s players are braced for a harsh post-mortem at their Surrey HQ on Monday despite the supreme quality of Friday’s victory over Wales.

The magnitude of the result will not ensure immunity from criticism as the national team strive to build on an impressive start to their RBS 6 Nations campaign.

There was an abundance of English gallantry and class on show at the Millennium Stadium but the quest to raise standards ahead of Saturday’s clash with Italy at Twickenham means the review process will highlight every error, however trivial.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants won’t attempt to sugar-coat the debrief. Instead, they want to refocus minds after the 21-16 triumph in Cardiff. Any trace of euphoria will be banished, any hint of complacency resisted.

There will be a concerted effort to adopt the never-satisfied mentality of a champion team, which is what England are desperate to become.

Wasps captain James Haskell delivered a barnstorming performance in Cardiff but even in the aftermath of a famous victory, he said: ‘Come the Monday review we will be hard on ourselves. The mark of a good side is being tough on yourselves in victory — go away, learn, prepare for a big week and it all starts again next Saturday.’

Asked if he expected to face harsh video analysis on Monday, the flanker added: ‘Oh, 100 per cent, 100 per cent. If you’ve got any ambitions to be a world-class side, you have to be really tough on yourselves.

‘The coaches will do a big presentation then the boys will do one-on-one feedback.

‘I’ll have to go through my game rigorously and I’m sure there are lots of things I can improve on. To get a win like we did is very special, so I think we’ll allow ourselves a few hours to smile, then the job will start again.’

This week’s challenge for the England management is to somehow recreate the intensity of their build-up to the Wales game.

Facing Italy at Twickenham is, in truth, a banker. The hosts will be determined to reveal a ruthless streak in the way they set about demonstrating their superiority, no matter how convincing their public utterances about taking nothing for granted.

One especially heartening aspect of the win over Wales was the level of composure and leadership in the visitors’ ranks.

Captain Chris Robshaw set an authoritative tone in the tunnel before kick-off with his refusal to take to the field when first requested, amid concerns that the opposition would keep his players waiting for too long in the bitter cold.

His defiant stance sent out the right message. His expression of stern conviction spoke volumes about a man who has grown into the role. Robshaw was standing up for his players and they responded by fighting their way out of what Lancaster called a ‘big hole’ after going 10-0 down.

‘We weren’t particularly panicked,’ said Haskell, referring to that early scoreline and the reaction to it. ‘We knew that if we stayed in the mix, looked after the ball and played in the right areas, we’d challenge Wales. We managed to do that.

‘At half-time we came in, re-grouped and knew we were in the game. We played sensible rugby, looked after the ball and kept our discipline.’

This ability to adapt calmly on the hoof was a sign of increasing English maturity. Haskell spoke of his aim to make good decisions and that has evidently been a priority across the board.

There were clear heads under pressure, as illustrated by two astute kicks from Mike Brown — one in restricted space to set up Anthony Watson’s try and another which found touch deep in Wales territory late on to help his team turn the screw.

Lancaster has often referred to the ‘leadership group’ in the squad and — despite the loss of several key men to injury — it was very much in evidence on Friday.

It certainly helped that Robshaw could call upon the support of four club captains in the starting XV — Haskell, Joe Marler (Harlequins), Dylan Hartley (Northampton) and Ben Youngs (Leicester).

‘Having leaders from clubs in the side can only help to support Robbo,’ said Haskell. ‘Obviously the buck stops with him and he’s got to have the final say but the “small talk”, as we call it, helps the boys to keep their heads on.

‘When we look at some of the best sides in the world — especially when we look at New Zealand — they’ve got a lot of experienced players there who have been through so many situations before.

‘We had some boys who had never played a game in Cardiff, so it was important to stay calm and keep making the right decisions. The best teams in the world do that.’

England are not in that category just yet but they took a giant stride in the right direction against Wales — not that the players will be allowed to savour the feat any longer.
