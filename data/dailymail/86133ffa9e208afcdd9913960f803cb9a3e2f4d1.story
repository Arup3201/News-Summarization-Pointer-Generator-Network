Clive Betts, chairman of the Communities and Local Government committee, said Ofsted's 'credibility is on the line'

Ofsted's credibility suffered a major blow yesterday when scathing MPs said the inspectorate was partly to blame for the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal.

The education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs.

Yesterday a Parliamentary committee probing Ofsted’s work there called for urgent inspections of every council in the country with responsibility for child protection – to ensure large-scale abuse isn’t being ignored elsewhere.

Clive Betts, chairman of the Communities and Local Government committee, said Ofsted’s ‘credibility is on the line’.

The Labour MP added: ‘The perpetrators bear ultimate responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children in Rotherham but the ineffectiveness of Ofsted’s inspections contributed to a failure to expose the extent of the problem.’

The fierce attack came on the day a second group of MPs found flaws in Ofsted’s handling of the Trojan Horse affair, in which Birmingham schools were accused of fostering religious extremism.

The Commons education committee said little evidence of radicalisation had been found and ‘confidence in Ofsted has been undermined, and efforts should be made by the inspectorate to restore it’.

Meanwhile, the Rotherham report pointed to Ofsted inspectors repeatedly labelling child protection in the town as ‘adequate’ – yet they were tied to their paperwork and had no idea what was really going on.

Instead, the inspectors simply accepted what they were told by local officials, and didn’t ask searching questions. ‘Ofsted does not appear to have probed beyond what it was told, and it failed to penetrate the professional jealousy and incompetence that distorted the operation of children’s social care in Rotherham,’ stated the report.

It also described Ofsted’s habit of calling the efforts of councils like Rotherham adequate as ‘ambiguous’. While Ofsted thought ‘adequate’ meant that improvement was needed, outsiders, including councillors, thought it meant ‘satisfactory’.

‘Rotherham appears to have gone a step further and interpreted it as indicating a strong performance.’

The MPs added that Ofsted was operating in a way that meant its different inspectors and departments did not discuss their findings with each other – and inspections of councils like Rotherham were ‘too short and narrowly focused’. They relied on paperwork – rather than actuality – and on what they were told by councils, who did not pass on concerns raised by whistleblowers and others.

‘We conclude that the experience of whistleblowers at Rotherham was the antithesis of what a good whistleblowers policy should be,’ the MPs said.

They called for Louise Casey – who was sent in by the Government to examine Rotherham’s failures after the scandal broke – to carry out a second inquiry to check that the town is working more effectively. A similar inquiry should be held into South Yorkshire Police, they said.

And they were ‘uneasy’ about the way in which Ofsted polices itself as it ‘may not be sufficiently accountable for its performance’.

Last night an Ofsted spokesman said: ‘We welcome the report and the committee’s recognition that the changes we have made since 2012 strengthen our ability to uncover where children are at risk. We know we didn’t get it right historically in Rotherham and have apologised for those mistakes.’
