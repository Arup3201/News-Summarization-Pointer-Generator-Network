We all have the odd photographic skeleton in our closets - those embarrassing childhood pictures that we hope never see the light of day.

But it seems that users of the Chinese equivalent to Twitter are more than happy to air their most cringeworthy snaps of bygone days.

Weibo users have been taking to the website in their droves to post hundreds of hilariously awkward pictures to amuse their friends using a hashtag that translates as 'showing off some embarrassing photos of our childhood'.

Old before their time: These Chinese girls have presumably been raiding their mothers' wardrobes. One can only assume that the cigarette is a toy

Made up: These two young Chinese boys were careful to ensure that their lipstick matched their ties

In the army now: These two girls having taking patriotism to a new level, but it's not clear why they are kitted out in full military regalia

The photos, many of which appear to 
date back to the eighties and early nineties, show the youngsters in a 
range of bizarre outfits and wearing far too much make up.

While
some parents have gone for the sophisticated look while dressing their 
little angels, others have just gone for the downright bizarre.

One youngster is pictured kitted out in fruit and vegetables, while others proudly strut their stuff in full military regalia.

Many
of the photos appear to have been shot in a studio - with children 
giving grown up props such as cigarettes that one can only assume are 
fake.

Bling: These two youngsters are all dressed up to the nines in their furs and finery

A tight squeeze: These two youngsters look less than comfortable in their oversized cardigans

Fancy dress: These youngsters probably won't be using these images on their Facebook profile page any time soon

Fruity: The girl on the left looks less than amused that her outfit has been adorned with fruit and vegetables, while the girl on the right looks slightly happier with her choice of extravagant make up

Some parents dressed 
their kids in outfits reminiscent of Chinese classics like Journey to 
the West and Legend of the White Snake.

Others are just candid shots taken at home of the tots in their parents clothes.

Some
seem to have been taken for festivals or special occasions - the red 
dots on the children's heads are for beauty or good luck.

This young Chinese boy looks utterly terrified. Perhaps at the excessive amount of knitwear he is wearing

Oh petal: This young girl (left) appears to be having a nap in her a flower bed,

Looking back: These two youngsters decided to post their embarrassing childhood pictures online
