New York institution Katz's Delicatessen is suing a local string of food trucks called 'Katz & Dogz' for ripping off the 125-year-old eatery's name and cinematic claim to fame.

While Katz's has been a favorite of New Yorkers for more than a century, most out-of-towners know the deli from a famous scene in the movie 'When Harry Met Sally' when Meg Ryan's character fakes an orgasm while eating a Reuben sandwich.

In the scene, Ryan's performance is so convincing that an older customer tells her waiter: 'I'll have what she's having'.

Movie moment: Those who grew up outside New York know the Lower East Side institution from the film 'When Harry Met Sally' when Meg Ryan's character fakes an orgasm in the restaurant

Quotable: The scene's punchline comes when an older patron tells her waiter: 'I'll have what she's having'

In addition to playing off the original deli's name, Katz & Dogz food trucks sells a sandwich called the 'Reuben Orgasm' which the original deli believes is a 'blatant' attempt to dupe customers.

Customers are likely to assume that the trucks, which sell the same Jewish-style fare, and the famed deli are somehow affiliated, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Wednesday.

Katz & Dogz, which operates two 
trucks and a cart, appeared on the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn 
last year, according to the lawsuit.

Like
 the deli, Katz & Dogz trucks sell pastrami, corned beef sandwiches,
 knishes and other traditional fare, according to the complaint.

'Defendants'
 blatant efforts to appropriate (Katz's) business goodwill, name and 
mark have resulted in (Katz's) being associated with food products and 
restaurant services over which it has no control,' the lawsuit said.

On the street: Katz & Dgoz food trucks sell the same Jewish fare as the famous Lower East Side deli. One of their sandwiches is named the 'Reuben Orgasm' a nod to the famous 'When Harry Met Sally' scene

Secret recipe: Katz's Deli is world-renowned for their large Reuben sandwiches which they've been selling on the Lower East Side since 1888

The deli's owners are seeking an order to bar the trucks from using any name that could easily be confused with Katz's.

Katz's owners claim they offered Katz & Dogz $7,000 to change the name but that the truck owners reneged on the deal before it was finalized.

Reached by telephone, an owner of Katz & Dogz who identified himself as Tarek, said the deli owners had been 'pushy' and 'not polite' when they approached him about a name change.

He declined to comment on the lawsuit because he said he had not seen it.

'I would like to avoid a lawsuit ... but I'm not going to sign any paperwork,' said Tarek.
