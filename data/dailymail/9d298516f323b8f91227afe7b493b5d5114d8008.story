A first edition of Mein Kampf signed by Adolf Hitler is set to fetch at least $35,000 in a controversial online auction.

The two-volume set was published from 1925 and inscribed by the far-Right leader to Philipp Bouhler, the 12th member of the Nazi party who oversaw the murders of 70,000 people.

It is the third copy of Hitler's racist autobiographical manifesto to be sold by the same Los Angeles auction house in just a month - with the previous two fetching $64,850.

First edition: This signed, two-volume copy of Mein Kampf could fetch at least $35,000 in a controversial auction. It is the third copy of Hitler's manifesto to be sold be the same auction house in just one month

Auction house owner Nate Sanders, whose eponymous firm is running the sale, defended the decision to sell racist books saying they were 'part of history'.

The sale of Nazi memorabilia is banned in some European countries, including Germany and France, and led to a major French case against Yahoo more than a decade ago.

But Mr Sanders, who is Jewish, said most collectors were not neo-Nazis but simply military history aficionados.

'It is a piece of history,' he said last week. 'The same people who collect Adolf Hitler (items) collect George Washington, or World War II, or George Patton.

'You have the whole gamut. There's white supremacist collectors of Hitler, and there's Jewish collectors of Hitler items.'

The volumes were signed by the Nazi party leader after his release from prison for high treason in 1924.

Inscribed: The books were given to Philipp Bouhler, the 12th member of the Nazi party who oversaw the murders of 70,000 people, for Christmas in 1925 and 1926, each carrying a message from Hitler

Dedication: The second message said: 'To Herr Philipp Bouhler, on the occasion of Christmas inscribed most sincerely as a sign of recognition of your performance of duties, Adolf Hitler, Munich, December 24, 1926'

They were published by Franz Eher Nachfolger of Munich and inscribed to Bouhler, one of the leaders of the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 when Hitler attempted to overthrow the Bavarian government by gunpoint.

He went on to be a key Nazi leader, and as Chief of the Chancellery for Hitler he led the barbaroc T4 'child euthanasia' programme.

Between 1939 and 1941 more than 70,000 sick and disabled children and adults were killed at extermination centres in psychiatric hospitals in Germany and Austria.

Anti-Semite: Hitler's manifesto outlined his conspiracy theory that Jews caused Germany's ills

Doctors continued their unethical practices right up until the end of the war, which historians believe may have claimed another 200,000 lives.

Mein Kampf was initially published in two volumes, the first in 1925 and the second in 1926.

The deeply anti-Semitic book outlined Hitler's political ideas and pushed the theory that Jews were responsible for all of Germany's economic problems.

It was dictated to Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess while he was behind bars for his part in the Beer Hall Putsch, and was designed to raise money for his defence.

The signed volumes are being sold with a starting price of $35,000, but could fetch far more when the auction ends on March 26.

Volumes of Mein Kampf from the 1930s are common because they were wedding gifts in Nazi Germany, but a copy signed by the author is rare.

The previous two copies of Mein Kampf held by the California auction house, both signed, had a starting price of $20,000 but sold for $64,850 on Friday.

The first volume of the edition now up for sale is signed: 'To Herr Philipp Bouhler, in grateful recognition of your loyal work for our movement on the occasion of Christmas 1925, inscribed most sincerely, Adolf Hitler, Munich, December 24, 1925.'

The signature on the second volume reads: 'To Herr Philipp Bouhler, on the occasion of Christmas inscribed most sincerely as a sign of recognition of your performance of duties, Adolf Hitler, Munich, December 24, 1926.'

Signed pages: The sale of Nazi memorabilia is banned in come European countries including France

Two copies of Mein Kampf, including this one inscribed to future SS leader Joseph Bauer, were sold by the same auction house on Friday for $65,000. Owner Nate Sanders defended the sales as 'part of history'

Sam Heller, of Nate D Sanders auctions, said: 'Volumes of Mein Kampf signed by Hitler are scarce, but these volumes take on extra significance because Hitler inscribed them to Philipp Bouhler.

'He was responsible for the Nazi Aktion program, which murdered over 70,000 disabled adults and children in Germany.

'They are an ominously signed set of books that futilely warned the world of Hitler's intentions.'

The books have been rebound in burgundy leather boards with gilt lettering since their publication.

The auction house has not revealed their history or the identity of the seller.
