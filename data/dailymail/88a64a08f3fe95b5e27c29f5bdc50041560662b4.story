Two non-executive directors have resigned from Mid Staffordshire health trust after yesterday's announcement that it will be going into administration.

Board members Eleanor Chumley-Roberts and Dr Lyn Hulme are stepping down from the trust that was at the centre of the Stafford Hospital scandal.

Deputy Chief Executive Maggie Oldham said: ‘The Trust Board wants to emphasise in the strongest possible terms that our focus remains on delivering care to our patients.

‘We want to reassure our patients and
all the local community that we will continue to put our patients first
throughout this challenging period.

‘We regret that the announcement by 
Monitor has resulted in the resignation of two of our Non-Executive 
Directors, Eleanor Chumley-Roberts and Dr Lynne Hulme. 

'We would like to
thank them for the service they have given to the Trust.’

Mrs Chumley-Roberts said at yesterday's board meeting: 'Transparency within the NHS has always been important, as has putting patients at the forefront.

'Personally I have been very disappointed with some of the changes that have taken place at very short notice.

'I resign from the board today and will be giving three months’ notice.'

Dr Hulme, who joined the board five months ago, said: 'I have been absolutely marginalised and made to feel irrelevant ever since.'

This comes after it was announced that Mid-Staffordshire may be the first foundation trust to be put into administration.

Monitor, the watchdog that regulates trusts, said it was considering the move in order to 'safeguard services' for local patients

South London Healthcare NHS Trust (SLHT) became the first ever NHS trust to be put into administration last year after it started losing around £1.3 million a week.

Now Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust could be the first foundation trust - the flagship trusts of the NHS - to face the same fate.

Monitor said it was consulting the Health Secretary and key organisations about the prospective appointment of trust special administrators.

They said that if administrators are 
appointed, they will devise a plan for the reorganisation and delivery 
of services that will be subject to public consultation.

Two months ago Monitor concluded that the
trust was 'clinically and financially unsustainable' after it was 
revealed that a subsidy of £73million would be need to keep it afloat 
for a further five years.

David Bennett, chief executive of Monitor, said: 'We are now consulting on whether to appoint trust special administrators with the expertise to reorganise services in a way which is clinically robust and sustainable.

'Their priority will be to make sure 
that patients can continue to access the services that they need and 
they will work with the local community to do this.

'Taking into account the consultation process, it would be several weeks before trust special administrators were in place.

In the meantime, the trust board will continue to ensure the current range of services are delivered for patients and trust special administrators would then continue that responsibility.'

A public inquiry into the trust said that patients had experienced 'appalling' care between 2005 and 2009.

It said that the trust had cared more about cost control than the quality and safety of the care it gave.

The families of patients involved in the Stafford Hospital scandal protested outside a meeting of NHS bosses yesterday and renewed their calls for the resignation of chief executive Sir David Nicholson.

A dozen people held placards with Sir David’s photograph accompanied by the words 'Resign', 'The man with no shame' and 'Too many deaths, no accountability'.

Sir David, who has faced calls to quit since the Francis report revealed issues a Stafford Hospital, was instead given a vote of confidence.

The trust has been the subject of three inquiries in four years.
