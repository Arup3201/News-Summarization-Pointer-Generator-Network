A 20-year-old woman was allegedly shot dead by her friend who tried to hang a loaded 1800s war rifle on the wall.

Destanie Leeson, from Midwest City in Oklahoma, was getting ready for a birthday party on Saturday night when her friend allegedly picked up the loaded 1891 rifle, which had fallen off the wall, and accidentally fired it, shooting her in the back.

Leeson's fiance Dalton Wilson said the apartment owner, who wasn't at home at the time of the shooting, kept the rifle loaded 'for protection'.

Leeson's fiance Dalton Wilson told news9.com Leeson was getting ready for a party with a friend in a unit at Chestnut Square Apartments.

Leeson, Dalton and Leeson's mother Robyn Williams lived in the unit directly opposite.

Dalton said he was at home when he heard a gunshot.

'My friend ran in yelling, freaking out, repeating himself, I just shot her, I shot her, I accidentally shot her,' he said.

'I walked in, and just froze. I rolled her over on to her back, started saying 'baby, just stay with me.'"

Wilson
said the loaded rifle was leaning against a wall by a bed when it fell.

His friend tried to place it back where it was when it discharged, 
shooting Leeson in the back.

'He was just trying to sat it back where it was, I honestly believe that,' Wilson said.

Leeson's mother Robyn Williams said she got on her hands and knees and begged for her daughter to survive. 

'She got up off the couch and walked 
across, and within 10 minutes she's dead,' Williams told news9.com.

'I heard a pop
and I ran over there and my baby was laying back. I blew in her mouth. I
heard gurgling. I thought she was breathing.

'I just don't believe she's gone, and even though I know it was an accident.

'I got on my hands and knees and I asked God to please, please spare my baby.'

Juanita McCane, Leeson's neighbor and friend, told news9.com she was shocked at how quickly it all happened.

'And it's like it went off like that. It
didn't even last that long,' she said 

'They said she screamed because she 
was in shock at the loud noise and stuff. And we looked over she was 
gone. She didn't make it.'

Leeson, a country music lover, had reportedly only lived in the apartment complex for a month with her mother and Wilson.

She grew up in Edmond and went to Edmond Santa Fe High School.

'Everyone, actually everyone's in shock. It still feels like I'm in a dream,' Violet West, a family friend, told news9.com.

Another wrote: 'you were the nicest person I ever met in my life, if anything was wrong you were there. we went through so much in middle school, and high school, growing up with you has been the best thing that a friend could ask for. ill love you always and miss you greatly.'

Leeson's family ran a car wash near Quail Springs Baptist Church yesterday to raise money for her funeral.

Williams said her the death of her daughter, who was born on Cinco de Mayo, 'came at the worst time' because Leeson's father Kurtus Leeson needs a liver transplant and her sister is expecting a child.
