In the escalating battle of big
data vs. human experts, score another win for numbers.

The most accurate predictions of which movies the U.S.
Library of Congress will deem 'culturally, historically, or
aesthetically significant' are not the views of critics or fans
but a simple algorithm applied to a database, researchers have found. 

The crucial data, scientists reported in Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, are what the Internet Movie
Database (IMDb.com) calls 'Connections' - films, television
episodes and other works that allude to an earlier movie.

By the 25-year-lag rule, the 1971 box-office disappointment 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' should be in the registry:IMDb lists 52 long-lag citations to it, the 37th most in theNorthwestern analysis. In December, six months after the scientists submitted theirpaper, the Library added 'Willy Wonka' to the list of 650cinematic immortals, just as the research predicted.

The number of references to a film more than 25 years after its in the IMBD database release was a nearly infallible predictor of whether itwould make the registry, topping 91 percent accuracy, saidapplied mathematician and study author Max Wasserman ofNorthwestern University.

For 15,425 films in IMDB.com examined in the study, the
measure that was most predictive of which made it into the
Library of Congress's National Film Registry, which honors
'significant' movies, was the number of references to it by
other films released many years later.

The 1972 classic 'The Godfather,' for instance, is referred
to by 1,323 films and television episodes, which as recently as
2014 quoted the 'offer he can't refuse' line, referred to the
famous horse-head scene, or played the theme music, for
instance. 

'Godfather' made the registry in 1990.

The number of references to a film more than 25 years after
its release was a nearly infallible predictor of whether it
would make the registry, topping 91 percent accuracy, said
applied mathematician and study author Max Wasserman of
Northwestern University.

Critics' judgments, Oscar wins, and box-office numbers did
not come close.

Films are nominated for the registry by the public and
chosen by the Librarian of Congress in consultation with a board
of experts including critics, academics, directors,
screenwriters and other industry insiders.

By the 25-year-lag rule, the 1971 box-office disappointment
'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' should be in the registry:
IMDb lists 52 long-lag citations to it, the 37th most in the
Northwestern analysis.

In December, six months after the scientists submitted their
paper, the Library added 'Willy Wonka' to the list of 650
cinematic immortals, just as the research predicted.

The end of the Oscars? Critics' judgments, Oscar wins, and box-office numbers didnot come close to the algorithm, the study found.

'Experts have biases that can affect how they evaluate
things,' said physicist and co-author Luis A.N. Amaral of
Northwestern. 'Automated, objective methods don't suffer from
that. It may hurt our pride, but they can perform as well as or
better than experts.'

Other movies identified by the Northwestern algorithm as
likely to make the Registry include 'Dumbo,' 'Spartacus' and
'The Shining.'

Of course, humans are not entirely superfluous:
flesh-and-blood creators must decide to refer to an earlier gem
in order to establish the crucial IMDb 'connections.'
