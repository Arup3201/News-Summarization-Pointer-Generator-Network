Israel captain Yossi Benayoun has left Queens Park Rangers to join his hometown team Maccabi Haifa on a two-year deal. 

The club said late Friday that Benayoun, who last week made a record 95th appearance for his country, will return to play in Israel after spending the last 12 seasons in Europe. 

The 34-year-old former Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and West Ham midfielder, had joined QPR in December 2013.

He spent four seasons at Maccabi Haifa early in his career, winning two Israeli league titles before transferring to Racing Santander. 

Benayoun told the club's official website that players and staff 'can bring back the great days of Maccabi Haifa.'

Maccabi Haifa had a disappointing 2013-14 Israeli Premier League season, finishing fifth, 31 points behind champion Maccabi Tel Aviv.
