A young mother is asking the Maine Supreme Judicial court to overturn a state-imposed do-not-resuscitate order for her baby daughter, who, in a medical miracle, came out of a coma after she was placed in her mother's arms to die.

The one-year-old, Aleah Peaslee, is brain-damaged and blind after her 22-year-old father Kevin Peaslee allegedly violently shook her on December 21 in an apartment he shared with her 17-year-old mother Virginia Trask.

The baby was placed under state custody because of the alleged child abuse, but Trask's parental rights have not been terminated, and she's fighting the state's imposition of a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order on the girl.

The child went into a 'deep coma' after the alleged shaking incident and doctors informed the mother that she was 'neurologically devastated,' reports Fox News.

Trask agreed to the DNR order after being informed of her daughter's grave condition.

However, after Aleah was removed from a ventilator and put into her mother's arms to die, she began breathing on her own and opened her eyes.

She eventually became alert and the parents canceled the DNR order.

However, medical personnel wanted to reinstate the order because the baby girl's still-grave condition.

The Maine Department of Health and Human Services then obtained authority to do so, without terminating the mother's parental rights.

The judge said that it was in Aleah's 'best interest' not to 'endure a cascading series of events that would inevitably lead to her death.'

The Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys and several other groups have filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Trask, saying that state officials do not have the constitutional right to make the choice for Trask's child.

Right to life: Aleah Peaslee's mother wants to overturn a state-imposed do-not-resuscitate order for the baby

'Even when a state agency believes the parent’s decision to be incorrect, that does not permit it to interfere in the parent’s right to make medical decisions for her child,' the brief reads.

'The state is effectively arguing that this mom isn’t fit to make medical decisions for her child simply because she wants the child to live. No one has declared this mother an unfit parent, yet the government wants to take her place,' ADF Senior Counsel Steven H. Aden told WND.

'The Maine Supreme Judicial Court should reaffirm Mainers’ interest in life, parental rights, and the integrity of the medical profession by reversing the lower court and restoring this mom’s full rights to make medical decisions on her daughter’s behalf.'

According to WND, Kevin Peaslee ran a stop sign with Aleah in the car and was pulled over by police.

They noticed the child needed medical help and drove the father and daughter to hospital.

Peaslee was bailed out of jail in January after pleading not guilty to felony assault and felony aggravated assault.

'Everyone deserves a fighting chance to live. All this mother is doing is fighting for that chance for her baby,' said ADF Senior Counsel Steven H. Aden. 'This mother’s parental rights should not be ignored; no one has the authority to deny her the right to save her daughter’s life.'
