The adoptive parents of missing North Carolina teen Erica Parsons appeared in court on Wednesday as they face more than 75 charges of fraud.

Casey and Sandy Parsons are accused of continuing to collect benefits for their adopted niece after her disappearance. They plead not guilty to the charges in Greensboro Federal Court.

Erica was 13 years old when she was last seen in November 2011, but wasn't reported missing until July 2013 when her 20-year-old adoptive brother informed authorities of his sister's absence after getting into a fight with his parents.

The Parsons continue to claim that they sent Erica to live with her 'Nan', though the girl's biological mother says no such grandparent exists.Â

The charges against the Parsons are not related to Erica's disappearance, but their actions after she went missing.

Federal prosecutors say the Parsons continued to collect several benefits intended for Erica, including a $634 monthly check for adoption assistance.

The Parsons are also accused of receiving state funds for Erica's Medicaid, Social Security and food.

Additionally, prosecutors say the Parsons lied on their income tax returns by using different identities to make up false dependents.

According to the indictment, Erica was home-schooled, had hearing problems and learning disability.

Adoptive mother Casey Stone Parsons faces 76 charges including theft of government funds, making false statements regarding healthy care matters and aiding the filing of a false tax return.

Her husband Sandy Wade Parsons faces 49 charges including conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States and theft of government funds.

The Erica Parsons case has continued to baffle investigators, and she has never been found.

The Parsons have insisted that they were not worried about her safety because they believed she was with 'Nan' - even though it later emerged that both of Erica's biological grandmothers were in fact dead.

The missing teen's biological mother Carolyn Parsons spoke out against the couple's claims, saying she will not give up looking for her daughter, who is now 15.

'I'm in somebody's nightmare and they will not wake up and let me out,' she previously told WBTV.

Casey and Sandy's lawyer, Carlyle Sherrill, said that it was Carolyn who introduced Erica to 'Nan', adding: 'That's who brought Nan to them and probably knows who Nan is.'

But Carolyn said: 'Nan and Irene don't exist. The only two people that know the truth are the only two people that won't give the truth.'

She also said she had not wanted to hand her daughter over to her in-laws, but felt she had to because she was unable to bring up the child properly.

'No mother wants to have children and just give them up,' she said. 'I didn't want to. She didn't deserve the life that I had.'

Carolyn says she has not seen Erica since January 2011, 10 months before she went missing.

A polygraph test carried out on Sandy Parsons was found to be 'strongly deceptive' when he described how he had nothing to do with her disappearance.
