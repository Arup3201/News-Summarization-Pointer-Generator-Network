This year's spectacular summer has seen Britain's vineyards enjoy a bumper harvest as forecasters predict warm temperatures will remain in parts of the country throughout the week.

In contrast to last year's washout, the long hot summer has produced near-perfect grape growing conditions, meaning the award-winning Camel Valley Vineyard near Bodmin, Cornwall, has enjoyed one of its best ever harvests.

Sam Lindo, chief winemaker on the vineyard, said: 'It's been an excellent summer for us. We
had temperatures above 30 degrees during our flowering period at the 
end of June and beginning of July which we've never had before.

Harvest: The Camel Valley Vineyard near Bodmin, Cornwall, has enjoyed one of its best ever harvests this year, which it puts down to conditions over the summer

Vineyard: Chief winemaker Sam Lindo said the crucial time for the vineyard was the flowering period, which this year saw temperatures above 30 Celsius

Conditions: In contrast to last year's washout, the long hot summer has produced near-perfect grape growing conditions

'This provided us with ideal weather conditions to produce an excellent crop.'

The vineyard, the largest and most decorated in Cornwall, has more than 24,000 vines across 17 acres on south-facing slopes.

It produces an array of white, red and rose wines and is famed for its sparking rose, which won best in the world at the 2010 World Wine Awards.

Mr Lindo, whose parents Bob and Annie 
opened the vineyard in 1972, said: 'We've had one of our biggest crops 
yet due to the weather.

'The crucial time for us is the 
flowering period, so we were extremely happy to get such perfect weather
conditions which will also help us with next year's crop.

'This
year started off terrible. In May it was very cold and wet and we were 
anticipating another summer like last year's so it was a relief when the
warm spell arrived.'

The UK enjoyed one of its hottest summers on record this year with temperatures putting 2013 as our warmest, driest and sunniest for seven years.

Approximately 189mm of rain fell over the summer, around three-quarters of the average and making this about the 16th driest since records began.

Meanwhile, after much of the country 
woke up to a blanket of fog this morning, forecasters have predicted 
temperatures will remain above average for 
the rest of the week.

Lindsay
Mears, spokesman for the Met Office, said: 'The main problem at the 
moment is the fog - that is to clear a little bit later by midday, but 
maybe it will hang around a little longer in East Anglia, on the Cornish
coasts and on the far west.

Three day forecast: Sunny intervals are expected on Friday following an overcast day on Thursday, although temperatures are expected to remain above average throughout

The changing seasons: Head gardener Adam Magee at St John's College, Cambridge, trimming the Virginia Creeper as it starts to turn from green to scarlet. Mr Magee can only access the wall of ivy from a punt on the River Cam, which flows next to the college grounds at Cambridge University

Hard at work: It takes Mr Magee around half a day every year to cut back the creeper, which covers the wall of an old warehouse in the college gardens

'Apart from that the rest of the country is going to be pretty nice really, quite dry with temperatures in their low 20s.'

Ms Mears said temperatures could reach 20C to 21C in the south and the midlands, while in the north it could fall to the mid-teens. However, some rain and cloud could arrive by tomorrow.

Ms Mears said: 'Over the next few 
days it's going to be showery in the west and this is moving across the 
country, spreading north.

'It
looks like a bit of a cloudy day tomorrow with the cloud persisting a 
bit, although East Anglia looks like it might have the best of the sunny
intervals along with Newcastle and Edinburgh.'

Fog on the Tyne: While much of the country woke up to a blanket of fog, forecasters have predicted temperatures will remain above average this week. Pictured is a ferry on the River Tyne

Forecast: The fog was predicted to have lifted across most of the country by midday, although it is believed tomorrow will be slightly more cloudy

Above average: Temperatures could reach up to 21C in the south and the midlands, although it is expected to be slightly colder in the north

Blanket: Commuters on their way into Newcastle city centre along the A1058 Coast Road were met with dense fog which blanketed Tyneside

Prediction: Some rain and cloud is expected to arrive by tomorrow, although it is believed it will turn sunny again by Friday

Temperatures tomorrow should remain similar to today, while Friday is looking like it could be sunny again across the country, apart from the south west.

The weekend however could be unsettled with the possibility of some heavy showers.

Ms Mears said: 'It's just above average for this time of year really, so it does feel warmer than it should be.

'The main thing is it cools off much more quickly at the end of the day because of the time of year.'
