A Brit with a condition which causes tumours to grow all over his face is set to star in a new music video after impressing the director with his performance alongside Scarlett Johansson in one of 2013's best films.  

Adam Pearson, who suffers from Neurofibromatosis, caught the eye of Slovak director Andrej Kolencik with his appearance in sci-fi film Under The Skin.

Kolencik was so impressed, he pulled out all the stops to get Pearson, 29, over to Slovakia so he could star in popular Slovak rock band Ciste tvary's latest music video.

Fairytale: Pearson played the main character in the video for Slovak rock band Ciste tvary

Kolencik revealed: 'I had not known him before Under the skin. 

'I watched the movie when we were preparing the music video and looking for a main character and we felt it was just perfect.'

The award-winning film director and visual artist said they managed to contact him through social media to ask him if he wanted to do the job.

The Slovak director had no big expectations - so was absolutely delighted when Pearson agreed.

He said: 'To be honest I only really started to believe it when I saw that Adam and his agent had agreed.'

The director, 30, needed ten actors for the yet-to-released music video, described as a dark fairytale.

He said: 'Adam stars as one of criminals sentenced to death and he and the other criminals to walk through woods to a public execution.'

Locations: The video was shot in a village in north-western Slovakia, and in a studio in Bratislava (pictured)

Delighted: 'He is very humble but also very professional,' said Kolencik after working with Pearson, pictured here with staff and the other members of the cast

The video was filmed in woods near the town Malacky, in the north west of Slovakia, and in a film studio in Bratislava.

Pearson, who had the starring role, also had to lie in snow and is later seen kissing a fairy.

'The co-operation with Adam was great,' Kolencik said. 'He always tried to give his maximum. He is very humble but also very professional.

'In the movie Under The Skin he played the part really well and it was likewise in our video, we got exactly what we wanted.'

Adam Pearson has been an outspoken campaigner for people with facial disfigurement for a number of years.

Pearson's condition, which affects one in every 2,300 people and which causes non-cancerous tumours to grow on nerve tissue, has left him acutely aware of the way people perceive him - and how he is potrayed in the media.

Before he appeared in Under the Skin, he starred in Channel 4 documentary Beauty and the Beast: The Ugly Face of Prejudice, which tackled the problem of prejudice head on. 

Writing for the Daily Mail  last year, he said he would love to play a Bond villain - but only if he was evil for the way he behaved, and not the way he looked.

'It would be an opportunity to raise the profile of people like me who have a condition that affects their appearance,' he said.  

'What I hope I can do is help to create a society where grown-ups don’t hold these immature, naive prejudices.'
