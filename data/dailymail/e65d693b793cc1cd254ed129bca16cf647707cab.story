Best-selling author Barbara Taylor 
Bradford, whose 28 novels about powerful women have amassed her a fortune of £200 million, has slammed erotic fiction Fifty Shades Of Grey
as repetitive, badly written and 'not even sexy'.

The British writer, 80, said that the EL James' novel, which became the top-selling book in Britain since records began when it was published in June 2011, is 'terribly badly written'.

Speaking to the Radio Times, Taylor Bradford also admonished 'hero' character Christian Grey as 'every woman's worst nightmare, although he's rich'.

Dismissing fellow British writer James' trilogy as 'repetitive and not even sexy', she went on: 'When the female character has her bottom 
smacked with a whip it's the end of the book, except her saying, 'Holy 
cow!' in excitement.'

In her outspoken interview, Taylor Bradford, whose novels often feature ambitious young women rising to the top, also said that in the real world such such success only stirs up jealousy and resentment among other females.

She said: 'Some women can be a bit devious, especially if you're successful. They're jealous and envious, although they'd be afraid to display that with me. I'd punch them in the face.'

'Wired differently': Barbara Taylor Bradford picture with her husband, Bob

A Fleet Street journalist before she became an author, the 80-year-old said: 'I was born ambitious, determined, driven, so nothing was going to stop me following my dream. I didn't see myself as a feminist.'

Miss Taylor Bradford, whose personal wealth is thought to be close to £200million, added: ‘I never had any harassment, or feeling up.

‘It’s strange today that the slightest compliment can be seen as harassment. It’s this generation. I don’t know why.’

Long lasting: Miss Taylor Bradford has been married to Bob for 50 years

She has been married to film producer Bob Bradford for 50 years and revealed that he calls her Napoleon because she is ‘bossy, dictatorial’ and can become ‘shrill’ – while she refers to him as Bismarck because of his German origins.

After decades of marital bliss, she has clearly learnt a thing or two about how to maintain a happy personal life. Her advice is to accept that ‘men and women are wired differently’.

Interview: Miss Taylor Bradford's interview in full is in this month's Radio Times

Miss Taylor Bradford whose works include A Woman Of Substance and a series of books on How To Be The Perfect Wife, told Radio Times: ‘I used to think it was true what mummy said – a woman makes a marriage work – but now I think the man has to put something into it, too.

‘When my 31-year-old goddaughter has problems with her husband I tell her, “Keep your mouth shut and do your own thing”.

‘Bob apologises for small things – “Sorry I broke that plate” – but never says sorry when we have an argument. Men can be stubborn and can’t multitask.’

Appearance clearly still matters to Miss Taylor Bradford, who confessed that she has used Botox and had eye surgery, but has not had a facelift – and insists the only pills she takes are vitamins.

The author, who lives in a New York penthouse, may enjoy a jet-set lifestyle but she is only too aware of the humble roots of her family.

She has taken part in a new ITV series Secrets From The Workhouse, in which she tells how her grandmother was forced into a workhouse and gave birth to two illegitimate children.

A 2004 biography by Piers Dudgeon revealed that Miss Taylor Bradford’s mother Freda was illegitimate – probably the daughter of the Marquess of Ripon, for whom her grandmother, Edith, was a maid – and had been in a workhouse.
