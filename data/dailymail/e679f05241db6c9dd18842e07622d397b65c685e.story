The seaside house immortalised in the classic film The French Lieutenant's Woman has been sold to the former Lord Mayor of London, Sir Roger Gifford.

Ware House, which is situated on 17 acres of sprawling land, boasts some of the most stunning views in Britain - looking out over 26 miles of coastline, with not a single property in sight.

The six-bed Regency house in Lyme Regis, Dorset, featured in the 1981 movie as the home of Meryl Streep's troubled character.

It was put on the market last year by 
owner Minnie Churchill, the granddaughter-in-law of former Prime 
Minister Winston Churchill.

Secluded: Miss Churchill and her partner Simon Bird bought the 200-year-old home in 1999 but are moving to Berkshire to be near her children and grandchildren

Period charm: Features such as the exposed fire place and the light and spacious living area bring warmth to the impressive home, which is situated on 17 acres of land

Miss Churchill and her partner Simon Bird
 bought the 200-year-old home in 1999 but are now selling and moving to 
Berkshire to be near her children and grandchildren.

Sir Roger and Lady Gifford are believed to have paid almost Â£3millon for the stunning property.

The Lord Mayor is elected annually as head of the City of London Corporation and former banker Sir Roger became the 685th person elected to the role between 2012 and 2013. It's different to the Mayor of London's role. Currently Boris Johnson, he leads the Greater London Authority (GLA) and is responsible for the strategic governance of Greater London.

Ware House boasts four reception rooms, 
six bathrooms, a library and well-maintained gardens. It also has two 
cottages within the grounds, a stable courtyard and croquet lawn.

The house is surrounded by well-kept lawns and flourishing gardens - and is just a short walk from the picturesque town of Lyme Regis.

But the property's main attraction is the
 unbroken views of the Jurrasic Coast - a World Heritage Site - across to the Isle of 
Portland, with nothing in the way to blot the landscape.

Martin 
Lamb, of estate agents Savills, said: 'The house sits to the west of 
Lyme Regis and faces the south east, which means it looks down on 26 
miles of coastline.

Elegant: One of Ware House's four reception rooms. Miss Churchill said that she is very sad to be leaving but is happy the house is going to a lovely family

Country retreat: A well-kept lawn stretches out in front of the spacious home. It also has two cottages, a stable courtyard and croquet lawn

'A
 French visitor to Ware House once compared the view to the Cote d'Azur 
to which Minnie Churchill is said to have replied that you can sea 
wall-to-wall villas on the hillside of the Cote d-Azor whereas you can't
 see a single house along the coast from the house.

'It has to be one of the best views in the country and it is a beautiful location.'

The impressive property was featured as the main house in the French Lieutenant's Woman - a film based on a novel by John Fowles that was later adapted for the screen by playwright Harold Pinter.

It tells the story of two affairs in 
parallel. One brings to life the doomed Victorian love story imagined by
 Fowles, and the other takes place between two actors on location - 
filming the French Lieutenant's Wife.

Hollywood home: Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons in the French Lieutenant's Wife, which was filmed at Ware House and the property's new owner Sir Roger Gifford

Shooting for the film took place on location in Lyme Regis, where the streets and buildings were carefully transformed into the Lyme Regis of 1867 - when the Victorian part of the film is set.

The intriguing film was nominated for five Academy Awards and won Streep a BAFTA for best actress.

Now
 Sir Roger, who was Lord Mayor of London from 2012 to 2013, is ready to make the iconic house his home.

The former banker
 has a main home in Scotland and it is thought will use the seaside 
retreat as a second property.

Speaking on selling the property, Miss Churchill said: 'We are very sad to be leaving but are happy the house is going to a lovely family.

'They have a home in Scotland which is where he is from and he is very keen on his Scottish roots.'

Mr Bird said: 'We have been in Lyme Regis for 15 years and think West Dorset is the most wonderful area in the county.

'However it's now time to move on and we will be officially moving out at the end of this month.'
