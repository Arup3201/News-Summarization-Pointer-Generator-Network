It might look small and unassuming but this radio controlled car is faster than an Audi R8, which costs around £80,000.

The fluorescent wedge-shaped radio controlled car is far from a standard toy as it has a blistering top speed of 188mph (303km/h) - the top speed of Ferrari’s classic 288 GTO.

The miniature car is called the R/C Bullet and is completely handmade with specialised materials and components, a little like the construction of a Formula One car.

Despite measuring 2ft (60cm) in length, the car is faster than some of the world’s most covetable supercars, including the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish and Bentley’s Continental Flying Spur – which certainly have speedy-sounding names - but have top speeds of 183mph.

Audi's R8 has a top speed of 185mph.

It is also a record breaker and is the world’s fastest radio controlled car, Autoblog reported.

The Bullet car sounds like a full-sized power car as it zooms past so fast that if you blinked you might miss it.

The car has carbon fibre wheels to withstand the forces created by high speeds, an incredibly aerodynamic body - which was tested in a wind tunnel - on top of its light-weight carbon fibre chassis and special tyres to supply the grip needed for a record-breaking run.

The wedge shape helps it have enough down force to stay glued to the track at such high speeds and an all-wheel drive system gives it plenty of traction.

It also has high speed motors and a long-range radio so it can complete long runs in a straight line to set its top speed, according to RC Groups.

It was built by radio controlled car enthusiast Nic Case, 50 from Southern California, who is no stranger to setting records.

Earlier versions of the Bullet reached almost 162mph (259km/h) in 2008 and 172mph (276km/h) in November 2013.

He is now determined to power through the 200mph (322km/h) barrier.
