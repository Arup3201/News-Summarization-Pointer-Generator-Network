There aren’t many people who begin their working lives with a burning desire to become a professional odour judge or a diver for golf balls.

Some might not even believe that job titles such as dinosaur duster or dog food tester have ever graced a CV.

But an American photographer has endeavoured to bring some of the world’s most unusual professions to our attention.

Odour Judge: Nancy Rica Schiff, who perhaps has one of the most unusual jobs of all, spent more than ten years travelling around America tracking down professionals that the rest of us never knew existed

Dog Food tester: The American photographer has endeavoured to bring some of the world¿s most unusual professions to our attention

Nancy Rica Schiff, who perhaps has one of the most unusual jobs of all, spent more than ten years travelling around America tracking down professionals that the rest of us never knew existed

Her adventures saw her scaling Mount Rushmore to follow a Presidential crack-filler, as he perilously dangled over the rock face, making sure that time didn’t take its toll on four of America’s most famous sculpted faces.

She has huddled underneath a trailer as hundreds of cows were artificially inseminated by a more-than-willing man and watched as a museum worker painstakingly dusted dinosaur bones.

Her unusual subjects could not be 
further removed from her own working life as a young portrait 
photographer, capturing household names such as Andy Warhol, Woody Allen
and Whoopi Goldberg.

Head for heights: Her adventures saw her scaling Mount Rushmore to follow a Presidential crack-filler, as he perilously dangled over the rock face, making sure that time didn¿t take its toll on four of America¿s most famous sculpted faces

Semen collector: One of the more unusual jobs was when she photographed a woman who collects bull's semen for a living

But in 1989, after spotting a race-timer at the Hollywood Race track in California, Miss Schiff became fascinated with those who leave their house every morning to thrust themselves into the most unconventional working scenarios.

After
three years of travelling and research since the inception of her idea,
she had amassed 15 photographs, which she bundled into a drawer.

The bizarre shots sat dormant for 
nearly five years before somebody expressed an interest and the idea for
a book became a reality.

There have now been two volumes of her images - Odd Jobs, released in 2002, and 
2006’s follow-up Odder Jobs.

She
describes her motivation for taking the pictures as a ‘fascination with
American humour’, which shines through in many of her photographs.

Pulling
ideas from newspaper articles, magazines and talking to people about 
the strangest jobs they knew, she eventually built up an impressive, if 
baffling, portfolio.

Sparring partner: Her unusual subjects could not be further removed from her own working life as a young portrait photographer, capturing household names such as Andy Warhol, Woody Allen and Whoopi Goldberg

She
found herself particularly interested in jobs involving ‘sex reversal’,
evidenced by the male tampon tester or female who designs men’s 
underwear.

Despite 
spending a large part of her working life meeting people because of the 
strange ways they earned a living, Miss Schiff says she was struck by 
the ‘normality’ of those she met.

While
some may expect an occupation as an animal keeper at the Playboy 
mansion to go hand-in-hand with unorthodoxy, Miss Schiff says: I was 
struck by how they were all quite normal – and all the people I met 
seemed to enjoy their jobs.’

She adds: ‘Some of them even invented their own jobs – such as the sandcastle instructor – which I found quite charming’.

Now
living in Italy, ‘walking around and taking pictures of things’, the 
photographer’s career often leant towards an unorthodox subject matter.

She has previously undertaken projects photographing twins and octogenarians.

Golf Ball Diver: She describes her motivation for taking the pictures as a 'fascination with American humour', which shines through in many of her photographs

Whether dealing with notable figures such as literary giant Arthur Miller, or the owner of a pet cemetery, she said she was always equally inspired – driven by the lure of turning up on a job and ‘not knowing what to expect’.

Describing how she picked suitable subjects for her odd jobs, she says: ‘My criteria for odd was simple: There had to be a twist of some sort.

‘Perhaps there was a gender reversal for example, a male bra designer or a young man testing tampons.

‘In fact, ‘testing’ professions 
became a whole chapter. Or perhaps the job dealt with death or a 
forbidden but funny subject—or maybe the job was performed by only one 
person on earth.’

Her 
stylised shots, carrying an otherworldliness befitting her subjects, 
were always taken in black and white, which she describes as the 
‘colours of photography’.

She
describes the knife-thrower’s assistant as the ‘strangest’ profession, 
saying she ‘just couldn’t believe anyone would do that’.

Undeterred she had a go herself, describing the experience as ‘scary’, but adding the caveat: ‘He was obviously very good.’
