Just over a year ago, Natalie Kerr was hooked up to an oxygen machine, so weak she was physically unable to hand her son and daughter their Christmas presents.

But thanks to an organ donor and a 
successful operation, Natalie, 31, was able to celebrate this year with 
10-year-old Brandon and four-year-old Isabelle.

'If I hadn't have had my new lungs 
then I wouldn't be here now,' she said. 'I was getting the presents wrapped early 
for last Christmas in case I was going to die.

'I was so poorly I knew I couldn't go on. I was no use to anybody.'

Since her transplant, the former nurse, from Bolton, has made the most of every moment.

Natalie, who was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension four years ago, said: 'It was my first Christmas being well with Isabelle and the first time I could properly enjoy it with her.

'Last year, I was sitting there with my oxygen mask on watching them open presents and I couldn't even help them put things together. The kids didn't know any different, really.

'I just smiled and carried on. What 
kept me going was hoping that I would get new lungs and all the time I 
was constantly thinking about getting better.'

Since having her operation, Natalie,
from Adlington, near Bolton, has amazed doctors 
with her progress and she now has check-ups every three months.

She has been making the most of being
well and has celebrated Bonfire Night and Halloween with the children, 
and got a new puppy, a chocolate Labrador.

The family also went on holiday to 
Spain, though Natalie had to fly back home and go straight to intensive 
care at Wythenshawe Hospital after just one day abroad when she began to
struggle to breathe.

She said this Christmas has been extra special and that she enjoyed shopping and taking the children to see Father Christmas for the first time.

She said: 'The kids were so excited and I couldn't wait to decorate the house and get the Christmas music on.'

Another highlight was the pantomime at Bolton Albert Halls.

It is an annual tradition for the family but Natalie says this time the children were excited because they could 'sit where they wanted'. Last she was in a wheelchair.

She hosted more than 10 members of her family on Christmas Day after making a deal the previous year that if she got new lungs she would cook.

Natalie said she thinks of her donor every day and wants to encourage others to sign the donor register to help others.

She said: 'If the lady who gave me her lungs could see how much she has changed my life I think she would be very happy.

'If only she could see the smiles on my kids' faces.

'Brandon wrote me a letter today and it said "I love you mummy and I am so happy that you have got new lungs". I think of her all the time.'

Pulmonary hypertension is a serious medical condition
involving raised blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries - the blood
vessels that supply the lungs.

It has a variety of causes: it can be inherited, related to other health conditions such as a hole in the heart, or the cause may be unknown.

It can damage the right side of the heart, making it less
efficient at pumping blood around the body and getting oxygen to the muscles.

In people with Â pulmonary hypertension, the walls of
the pulmonary arteries are thick and stiff, making it difficult for them to
expand to allow more blood through. Alternatively, the arteries may be blocked
by blood clots which can also hinder blood flow.

This makes it difficult for the right-hand side of the heart
to pump blood through the arteries, so this part of the heart has to work
harder, and will become gradually weaker, potentially leading to heart failure.

Symptoms include: shortness of breath, fatigue, feeling faint or dizzy, chest pain, a racing heartbeat and leg swelling.

It can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are
similar to many other heart and lung conditions, but it can be very serious so
it is important you visit your GP if you experience symptoms. Left untreated,
it may cause heart failure.
