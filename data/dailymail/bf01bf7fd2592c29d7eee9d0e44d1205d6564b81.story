Peace talks between American and the Taliban, which were being held in secret, have been 'blown out of the water' after details - including the identification of the Taliban's negotiator - were leaked.

In a bitter blow to both parties, Tayyab Agha, Taliban leader Mullah Omar's former private secretary, was outed as the man leading his side's negotiations, which have been halted in their infancy.

The breakdown of the talks, which began before the death of Osama bin Laden, has sparked claims that the details of the clandestine meetings were deliberately leaked by 'paranoid' Afghan government figures.

It has come to light that the meetings, designed to broker a peace deal between the terrorist group and its opponents who have fought a decade-long bloody war in Afghanistan and on the Pakistani border, took place in Germany and Qatar this year.

It is alleged that Agha met with senior officials from the US State Department and Central Intelligence Agency, and the discussions were mediated by Michael Steiner, Germany's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Western diplomats indicated that the negotiations had only been at the preliminary stage, and were designed to show the Taliban, who admitted to the 9/11 attacks 10 years ago which killed 3,000 people, that the U.S. and its allies are deadly serious about forging peace.

The diplomats told the Daily Telegraph that the terrorist group's leaders were wary of opening talks with the Americans, as they thought that the U.S. only wanted to find out their movements.

Further, the leaders believed that if news of the discussions were publically aired, they would lose face and credibility in the wake of their former leader, bin Laden's killing in May.

However, following just three meetings - one in Qatar and the other two in Germany held in March and April - details have been leaked to the Washington Post and German newspaper Der Spiegel - both named Agha as the principal Taliban negotiator.

Sources suggest that Agha has not been seen since the revelations, despite the efforts of American officials, who attempted to contact him through intermediaries in Quetta and Peshawar in Pakistan.

According to the leaks, talks between the U.S. and the Taliban had taken place before he was killed in May

'The talks were a big deal, the real thing,' a source 'close to the talks' told the Telegraph.

'I hope people will learn the lesson on the importance of confidentiality in the early stages. People in the US are horrified about what has happened.'

Meanwhile other sources in Kabul - the second largest city in Afghanistan - also agreed that the discussions had been 'blown out of the water'.

For years the Taliban had rejected Afghan president, Hamid Karzai's attempts to get around the negotiation table.

However, details of contact with a senior aide to Mullah Omar sparked quiet confidence in Kabul - U.S. officials wanted to keep the Afghan government in the loop, so told them of the meetings.

The former deputy European Union representative in Kabul and an expert on the Taliban, Michael Semple believes that the leaking of the meeting's details will be hugely damaging to both sides.

'The Taliban have long claimed that they will drive the foreigners out by force before contemplating talks,' he told the Telegraph.

'They need a period of confidential contact to satisfy themselves that there is something serious on offer to warrant them taking the big step of acknowledging that negotiations have to start now and not after things have been settled on the battlefield.

'When the fact that talks had taken place and the identity of the Taliban envoy were leaked the Taliban shifted into their version of damage control.

'The leadership put it about that the contacts were nothing out of the ordinary.

'They were just routine discussions about prisoner releases, which a movement at war has to undertake periodically.

'It is hardly surprising that the Taliban chose to downplay the significance of Tayyab Agha's mission.

'In terms of progress towards negotiations which might end the war, it has proved a case of one step forward and two steps back.'
