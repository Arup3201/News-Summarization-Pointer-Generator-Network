Never buy a player on the back of a good World Cup used to be the maxim in football, too many clubs having been deceived by a player shining for three or four games with their national team in the rarefied atmosphere of tournament football.

However, some players do grow and mature more rapidly in the spotlight and appear to establish themselves as players worth watching by virtue of the fact that they deliver under the highest pressure.

Marcos Rojo is one of the above. Going into the World Cup the 24-year-old Sporting defender was widely perceived as one of the weak links in the Argentina team, especially by his nation's press who were unconvinced by his selection in the starting XI. In fact, most would have said he was only there because of the lack of a suitable alternative.

But as the tournament progressed, he established himself, being praised by fans and eventually the press as well. He has a degree of flair about him – he cleared the ball in the penalty area against Bosnia by flicking one leg behind the other, a trick known as a rabona in Spanish.

And having scored the third and winning goal against Nigeria somewhat fortunately – the ball bounced up off his knee as he followed in a corner - he grew steadily in confidence, nutmegging Arjen Robben in the semi-final and then performing well in the final against Germany.

He more often played in central defence for Sporting which is probably why he is attracting Louis van Gaal’s attention as a potential left-sided player in a back three or as a left-sided wing back. And he is quick – the FIFA stats had his top speed down as quicker than Robben's in the semi-final against Holland.

Born in La Plata, 45 miles from Buenos Aires, down the River Plate, he came up through the ranks at the Estudiantes La Plata, the club most-closely associated with former United midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron.

Enigma: Veron was fabulously talented but his Old Trafford career was blighted by inconsistency and a lack of defensive cover - here he enjoys a highlight, scoring in the famous 5-3 victory at Tottenham in 2001

Indeed Veron and Rojo were team-mates when the defender was starting out his career, Veron having returned to his home town club. Rojo had a brief spell at Spartak Moscow before signing for Sporting two years ago.
