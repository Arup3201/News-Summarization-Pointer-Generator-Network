Bungling road painters made a schoolboy error when they misspelt 'keep clear' markings - outside a primary school.

Parents instantly spotted the gaffe yesterday by contractors who were resurfacing the street outside Highfield Primary School in Blacon, Chester.

Instead of writing SCHOOL - KEEP CLEAR the workers had painted SCHOOL - KEEP CLAER - a mistake which had to be hurriedly corrected this morning.

Schoolboy error: Council contractors misspelt the word 'clear' outside a primary school in Blacon, Chester

Spot the difference: The mistake was quickly corrected this morning after it was reported to the council

It comes less than a year after contractors for the same council, Cheshire West and Chester, put keep clear markings and zig zag lines outside the site of a primary school which had closed five years earlier and been demolished.

A council spokesman said yesterday's error was spotted 'as soon as the work was carried out'.

The spokesman added: 'Our contractors have been out to the site this morning to correct it.'

One eye-witness said: 'The council
 workers have made a mockery of themselves making such a schoolboy error
 - they can't even spell a five-letter word.

'It
 was quite funny when even five-year-olds spotted that they'd spelt it 
wrong. Thankfully it wasn't too long before they corrected it.'

The council said it is making changes outside the primary school to improve safety after a number of near misses in which young pupils were almost hit by vehicles.
