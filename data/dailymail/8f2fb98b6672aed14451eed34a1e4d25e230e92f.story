A multi-million pound expansion of South Wales' only privately-run jail Parc Prison will see phones installed in new cells.

But Jason Evans, Head of security at the Bridgend prison which is set to 
become the biggest in Wales and England by 2015, has stressed this does 
not mean it is going soft on criminals.

Mr Evans insisted having phones installed in the 216 new cells, which is also being introduced in other prisons, will not compromise 
security or public protection.

He said: 'I know people think that 
will be a retrograde step. But once there's a phone in prison it doesn't
really matter where you put it.'

He said use of the landlines will 
remain restricted and monitored in exactly the same way as traditional 
cell-block phones. Inmates can only ring approved numbers and the lines 
will be shut off at certain times.

Director of the prison, Janet Wallsgrove, 51, insisted that the G4S-run jail operates a 
zero-tolerance approach to rule breaking and crime by both prisoners and
visitors, waging a 'war of attrition' on drug smuggling.

Mrs Wallsgrove, who took the helm seven years ago, added that Parc achieved a level-4 exceptional score in the Government's prison rating system in August.

By early 2015, Parc will house more than 1,700 inmates.

She said the Â£35m expansion - including a plush visitor centre - would help staff manage inmates better and continue to crack down on drug smuggling.

'People would have you believe that everybody here is having a lovely time with their feet up watching Sky TV and that just isn't the case,' she said.

Mrs Wallsgrove said a 'humane' ethos is at the heart of the establishment and that staff have found that in most cases, the better you treat a prisoner, the better they behave. But she said this does not mean she gives an inch when it comes to security.

The prison operates a modern approach to the treatment of the 6,000 adult and 200 child visitors who come through the gates every month, allowing them to meet inmates in more relaxed surroundings than the traditional visiting rooms.

But there are still four drug sniffer dogs, specially-trained officers, CCTV and intelligence links to help stop drugs getting into the prison.
