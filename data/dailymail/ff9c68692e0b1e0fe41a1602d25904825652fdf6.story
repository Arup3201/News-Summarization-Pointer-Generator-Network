Erin Boag defied those who criticised her for dancing while pregnant saying: it's 'good exercise'. She added: 'What do people expect us to do, just sit at home resting all day?'

When Erin Boag , star of Strictly Come 
Dancing, took to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall at 22 weeks pregnant
 in December, she thought nothing of her protruding bump.

Her mind was only on delivering the 
stunning routines with partner Anton du Beke that have thrilled viewers 
for the past ten years.

But the audience was not equally unfazed by her dancing ‘in her condition’. One angry fan even rang the venue afterwards to complain – saying they may not have bought a ticket had they known.

For in spite of increasing evidence of the benefits of exercising while pregnant – and that ‘putting your feet up’ is an unhealthy thing to do – it remains a controversial subject.

‘The complaint didn’t bother me – I laughed more than anything else,’ says Erin, 39.

Now 36 weeks pregnant and due at the end of the month, she is still going to the gym.

‘There’s nothing wrong with dancing while pregnant; it’s good exercise. What do people expect us to do, just sit at home resting all day?

‘I’ve not performed since but still work out and teach dancing – I dance belly to belly with the students to show how it’s done.

'I do get looked at a lot in the gym when I walk in and when I’m working out – especially now I’m really big with only four weeks to go.

'But I think if a lady can work out when pregnant, then good on her. Exercising brings many benefits – like an easier recovery after birth – and I’ll do whatever I can to make things easier.’

As well as speeding recovery after labour, exercising while pregnant is good for the baby; recent research has suggested it can boost brain development, strengthen blood vessels and protect from diabetes.

Meanwhile, many pregnant women – and their babies – suffer health problems due to excess weight: obesity in pregnancy can trigger pre-eclampsia, diabetes, and even cause foetal abnormalities.

Around half of all mothers-to-be are now overweight or dangerously obese.

Erin, who lives in Kingston,  Surrey, with her husband Peter O’Dowd, 48, dropped out of Strictly last May as she wanted to conceive.

‘Time was ticking on and I wanted to have a baby – I was already 38 and didn’t want to push it too far. I knew Strictly would be too much if I was pregnant as it is very, very strenuous, and seven days a week, seven hours a day.’

The New Zealand-born dancer conceived naturally within months, but suffered extreme morning sickness – which only swimming eased.

‘From six to 15 weeks I was so sick I didn’t want to see the light of day. Then at 16 weeks a nurse suggested I try swimming, despite being sick, so I dragged myself to the pool and I felt much better. I swam four or five times a week until the nausea went away at 21 weeks.’

She then returned to her regular gym sessions for an hour four or five times a week.

‘In the past couple of weeks I’ve had to slow down as my body is getting tired – it’s like ploughing through mud. So I now walk on the treadmill, go on the cross trainer and bike, plus do a few light weights. I don’t push myself and I don’t run now as your body releases a hormone to soften the joints so you have to be careful.’

Erin’s exercise regime has the approval of her doctors. ‘I asked my consultant if it was OK to exercise and he said absolutely yes; your body will tell you when to stop, so just listen to your body.’

This advice echoes that of Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr Clive Spence-Jones, who recently said: ‘There is no evidence that exercise during pregnancy can damage the baby or cause complications.

‘A large round-up of studies in 2010 came to this conclusion – the trials reviewed included vigorous non-contact exercise such as swimming, static cycling and floor-exercise programmes. The growing baby is surrounded by fluid in the womb that keeps it well insulated from movement outside.’

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends moderate exercise such as brisk walking, jogging or cycling, three times a week. Vigorous exercise should be undertaken with caution as the resting heart rate increases during pregnancy.

Erin says: ‘I went for a 36-week scan and everything is perfect – there’s a little too much fluid around the baby but doctors aren’t concerned and my blood pressure is fantastic.’

Once the baby is born Erin will be heading straight back to the dancefloor – and the gym – as she and Anton have a show booked just seven weeks after the birth.

‘It gives me a target. I’ve put on two stone and none of my clothes fit: my thighs are like tree trunks, my boobs are huge and my bum… I’m not looking backwards in the mirror until the baby is born.

'The doctors don’t seem concerned but in my profession it’s difficult to come to terms with – my career depends on my fitness and weight. I’m being careful about what I eat and will work very hard once the baby’s born.

'People may criticise but that’s my living – so the baby will be in a pushchair as I go running.

‘But right now it’s all about the baby’s health. I’m really excited and can’t wait to meet the little bundle.’
