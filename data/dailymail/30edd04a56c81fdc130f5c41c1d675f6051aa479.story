Jordan King, the son of former Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King, is the new development driver at Manor, the F1 team of which his father is chairman.

King will also compete this season in GP2, F1’s feeder series, with a view to taking on full racing responsibilities for Manor in the future.

‘I am obviously over the moon to be joining Manor Marussia F1 Team as a development driver,’ said King, 21, who was Formula Three champion in 2013. ‘This is such an exciting project, full of great people and with a real chance of success. This is another great step closer to my ultimate goal of racing in Formula One.’

King’s father is one of the major figures in the rebirth of Manor after the team, then known as Marussia, went into administration at the end of last season. He has worked closely with the main backer, energy entrepreneur Stephen Fitzgerald, to get them on to the grid for the season’s opening race in Melbourne on Sunday.

It was also announced today that Spaniard Roberto Mehri, 23, will take the second race seat at Manor, alongside Brit Will Stevens.

Mehri had a season with Manor Motorsport in Formula Three Euro Series in 2009, before winning the championship two years later. Last year he was third in the tough Formula Renault 3.5 Series and took part in practice for Caterham on the Fridays of grand prix weekends.

Team principal John Booth said: ‘It is fantastic to welcome Roberto and Jordan to the team. Not only are they very talented young drivers with exciting futures ahead of them, they are “graduates” of Manor Motorsport in junior formulas, which is obviously very rewarding for us, given that the development of young talent is an important part of our philosophy.
