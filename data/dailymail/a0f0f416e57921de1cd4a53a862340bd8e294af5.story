Former Oakland Raiders line-breaker Rolando McClain - who retired from the NFL in May aged just 23 following a string of controversies - has explained how he was headed down a path of anger-filled self-destruction and felt like he 'just wanted to kill someone'.

Stepping away from the game less than a month after singing with the Baltimore Ravens, McClain - who in 2010 was given a rookie contract worth $40 million over five years - said he feared he was on-track to be the next Aaron Hernandez, who he watched get hauled away in handcuffs and charged with first degree murder.

McClain's comments, which are revealed in a new interview with ESPN magazine, come after he was arrested three times in 16 months during visits home to Decatur, Alabama.

McClain said he started developing a disdain for pro football due to constant requests for money from family and friends in Decatur, leading him to fork out over $600,000 over a six month period to take care of those close to him.

On the day of his most serious arrest - for discharging a firearm beside a man's head during an altercation - McClain was in town for his grandfather's funeral.

Upon arrival he found out his family had planned a $20,000 funeral, including limousine transfers, that he was to pay for.

'I was pissed off,' McClain told ESPN.

'I was feeling like Aaron Hernandez or something ... like I just wanted to kill somebody.'

'(I) would have ended up locked in a cage like an animal. That had to be the only outcome.'

McClain has spent the last few months in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, which is his college town.

He is taking classes at the University of Alabama to work towards a degree in family financial plan.

It's a far cry from where he was five months ago.

McClain was arrested for disorderly conduct in April at a park in Decatur, where an estimated 700 people had gathered for the night, just 10 days after signing with Baltimore.

'The officers started moving everyone out of the street, when they heard someone from the crowd start yelling ''F the police'',' Decatur Police Lt. John Crouch said at the time.

'They continued to move people out of the streets when they heard it again. They eventually identified the person in the crowd.

'They moved in, told him he was under arrest for disorderly conduct, at which at that point, he tried to jerk away.'

They later identified the man as McClain.

In January he was arrested after he reportedly signing an expletive instead of his name on fine to the for a window-tint violation on his vehicle.

Aaron Hernandez, a former tight end for the New England Patriots, was indicted by a grand jury in August for the murder of Odin Lloyd, a friend and semi-professional player for the Boston Bandits. Lloyd's body was found about a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, with multiple gunshot wounds to the back and chest

Despite his trouble-plagued year, McClain said he would 'probably' return to the NFL next season.

He is continuing to keep in shape while in Tuscaloosa.

If he does return to the game, the Ravens will retain his rights.

McClain appeared in 41 games over three seasons for the Raiders and recorded 246 tackles over that span.

He was released from the Patriots shortly after his arrest in June.
