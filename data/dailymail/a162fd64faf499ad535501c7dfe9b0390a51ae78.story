A holidaymaker in France was killed by an explosion believed to have been caused by a World War Two bomb that had washed ashore on the French island of Groix.

The 26-year-old man died after a blast near a campfire while on a break in Brittany with nine other friends, one of whom was seriously injured in the blast.

Early indications, reports radio station France Bleu, suggest the tide had brought the unused explosive to the shore before it detonated at about 2am on Sunday after the group had gone to bed.

The injured 25-year-old friend was transported by helicopter to Nantes while the other members of the party were taken to hospital in nearby Lorient to be treated for shock. 

Police soon cordoned off the beach and a metal object reported to be a 'piece of ammunition' from the second world war was found.
