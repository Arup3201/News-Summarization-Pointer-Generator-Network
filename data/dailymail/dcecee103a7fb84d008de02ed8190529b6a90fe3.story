The Royal Family put on a show of force yesterday after one of their most publicly disastrous weeks in recent years.

The Queen attended church near Balmoral with Prince Philip and other senior royals including Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Edward.

But although Charles might have been praying for divine intervention to keep his son on the straight and narrow, he was not accompanied by Prince Harry with whom he has been spending the weekend.

However the Mail can reveal that 
Harry will appear in public this week for the first time since the 
scandal over his Las Vegas trip broke, attending an official engagement 
on either Thursday or Friday.

The 27-year-old royal is due to make an 
appearance at the Paralympics in London in his role as an official Team 
GB ambassador – a potentially mortifying experience.

As revealed by the Mail on Saturday, 
Harry flew up to his father’s Highland estate, Birkhall, at the weekend 
for a heart-to-heart chat about the storm that has engulfed him since he
was photographed playing a game of ‘strip billiards’ with a group of 
complete strangers in his Las Vegas hotel room.

One girl has already sold her account
of the night, recalling how the third in line to the throne and his 
friends trawled for women in a seedy hotel nightclub before inviting 
them up to his £5,100-a-night suite.

She claimed the prince was the 
first to take his clothes off before encouraging a pretty blonde he ‘had
his eye on’ to do the same and that his police protection officers 
failed to intervene as fellow revellers snapped away with camera phones.

One Sunday newspaper claimed 
yesterday that another girl was negotiating a warts-and-all television 
interview to be broadcast in the next few days.

Charles has so far remained ‘sternly 
protective’ of his son, although that may well change should further 
explosive revelations emerge.

Significantly, although every royal 
present in Scotland over the weekend went grouse shooting together on 
Friday and Saturday, Charles and Camilla opted not to join them.

 It is 
believed they stayed behind at Birkhall talking to Harry before he 
returns to his military duties as an Apache attack helicopter pilot.

Royal sources say Charles is less 
concerned by what his son did than the fact he and his Scotland Yard 
protection team allowed themselves to be compromised.

When Harry arrives back at his base at
Wattisham, Suffolk, it is also likely he will face a stern stressing 
down from his commanding officer and be asked to donate two weeks’ 
salary – around £1,450 – to charity.

It has also been reported that 
Harry’s new love interest, 23-year-old aspiring actress Cressida Bonas, 
is deeply unimpressed by his antics.

And Harry’s private secretary Jamie 
Lowther-Pinkerton has ordered him to close the Facebook account he 
operated under the pseudonym Spike Wells.

But Rupert Murdoch, whose Sun 
newspaper became the first British publication to print pictures of 
Harry naked in Las Vegas, took to Twitter to urge critics to give the 
prince ‘a break’.

As for Prince Philip, his appearance 
at Crathie Kirk yesterday showed how well the 91-year-old is recovering 
since he was discharged from hospital last Monday following the 
recurrence of a bladder infection.
