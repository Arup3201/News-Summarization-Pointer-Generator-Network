It was meant to be the trip which provided Valerie Trierweiler with the perfect PR opportunity following embarrassing revelations about her private life.

But the French First Lady’s awkward attempts to hug a Congolese schoolchild did not exactly go according to plan when the girl appeared to burst into tears.

Miss Trierweiler was in Africa with her partner, French President Francois Hollande, as part of a conference of French-speaking countries in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The trip follows a difficult week for
Miss Trierweiler after claims that she was the shared mistress of the 
then future president of France, Hollande, and conservative minister 
Patrick Devedjian.

And despite never before in her 
profile role being associated with humanitarian causes, the 
immaculately tuned-out Miss Trierweiler was pictured with young homeless
women.

But her attempts to hug one of the 
children turned from a positive photo opportunity into a disaster  as 
the youngster’s body language made it clear she was a little reluctant 
to be the subject of Miss Trierweiler’s sympathy.

It was the first time the French 
First Lady has been seen in public since explosive revelations in a new 
book which claimed that the 47-year-old had, while still a married 
woman, been the shared mistress of both Hollande and Devedjian.

Le Parisien called the photo op an attempt at ‘restoring her image’ which remains ‘extremely degraded’.

When asked about her the growing relationship scandal surrounding her, Miss Trierweiler told journalists travelling with her to Kinshasa, the capital of Congo: ‘I don’t want to talk about it’.

Referring to the unnamed youngsters she sat next to she added: ‘When you see those problems there, when we see that these children are in danger of survival, the rest does not matter.’

Despite this, she has issued writs against two leading political journalists who exposed her colourful romantic history in La Frondeuse (The Troublemaker), a new book.

Its publication came after a Harris Interactive poll found that an astonishing 81 per cent of French people had an unfavourable opinion about Miss Trierweiler.

This makes her by far the most unpopular first lady in the history of the Fifth Republic.
