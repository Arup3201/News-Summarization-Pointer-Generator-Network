'I beat the f**k out of him': Sophia Body is being held on $2million bail after admitting to the brutal beating of an elderly man

A 28-year-old Chicago woman has allegedly admitted she dragged an 82-year-old man from his car and 'beat the f*** out of him' because he bumped her vehicle.

Sophia Body has been charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery of a senior citizen after the incident, which occurred Thursday night in the city's Grand Crossing neighborhood.

Authorities responded to the 900 block of East 79th Street after witnesses reported a battery in progress.

They arrived to find the octogenarian bleeding from the right side of the head and suffering from lacerations to his back, police said.

Body allegedly admitted she beat the elderly man, who hasn't been named, because he gently hit her car after he pulled over to help her.

'Yeah, I pulled his a** out of the car and beat the f**k out of him,' she told officers, according to a police report cited by the Chicago Tribune.

The alleged victim told officers he pulled over after two women flagged him down. He said he dinged the woman's car by mistake.

That's when the pair dragged him out of the vehicle and hit him in the head and body several times, including with a screwdriver, police said.

A nearby convenience store's surveillance camera caught the attack and the owner handed the footage over to police for review, reported the Tribune.

The Tribune also reported that a second woman, aged 38, was being held for questioning but had not been charged early Sunday. However, a Chicago Police Department spokesman denied that claim to MailOnline.

'As far as we know, there is only one person being investigated,' the spokesman said.

Body is being held in Cook County Jail on $2million bail.

The victim, of the South Side's Brainerd neighborhood, was taken to John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, where his condition had stabilized.

He suffered lacerations to the upper and lower back and bleeding to his head, police said.
