The shopping trolley bag so beloved of grannies may be a familiar sight in the post office queue, but it has never been the chic shopper’s choice — until now. This winter, two of fashion’s biggest names have launched luxury designer versions of the humble wheelie bag.

Of course, you’d have to win the lottery before you found yourself trundling Louis Vuitton’s £14,100 version or Chanel’s £6,025 edition around Waitrose.

But the rediscovery of the shopping trolley goes beyond Paris’s poshest labels, and this season they are the accessory of choice for stylish shoppers everywhere. Indeed, one brand, Sabichi, has seen sales leap by almost 40 per cent in the past two months alone.

So, which are more It Bag than Old Bag? We pick the shopping trollies you can pull along with pride...

MONOCHROME MAGIC

Rolser four-wheeler Mono trolley, £69, Thetrolleyrevolution.com

This sturdy trolley by upmarket Spanish brand Rolser is solidly constructed from metal and high-quality plastic.

It also has a smooth folding mechanism both in the centre (to halve it in size for packing away) and on the wheel configuration, which you can switch from four wheels to two for a speedier ride round supermarket corners by pushing the stand down. As a result, it’s easy to manoeuvre.

The bag itself is strong and light, in thick waterproof fabric, with an internal pocket for bits and bobs. Trolley bags are measured in litres and this one will hold 48 — that’s nearly 85 pints of milk. The top pulls closed with a duffel bag-style toggle, beneath a flap with a press-stud that protects the top from rain.

The only disadvantage is that the wheeled height is non-adjustable, so if you’re planning on wearing heels to do your shopping, you may find yourself having to stoop to grab the handle.

STYLE RATING: 4/5

CHINTZY CHARM

Sabichi Bon Bon shopping trolley, £24, sabichi.co.uk

This pretty two-wheeler brings a touch of chintzy charm to your shopping with its delicate pattern and polka dots — and at £24 it is also one of the cheapest on the market.

While the fabric feels light, it is well put together and has a thermal lining, making it perfect for transporting frozen food.

At 40 litres (that’s a potential 80 tubs of Haagen-Dazs), it is still pretty big but the fastening is a little flimsy: just a small square of Velcro holds the trolley’s flap down.

The wheels have good rubbery tyres, although it won’t take long for their white sheen to look grubby.

The wheels, like the bag, are supplied unconnected to the frame, but after a couple of false starts we found them easy to put on (make sure they are clicked properly into place) — although you may not fancy banging the bag up and down kerbs.

STYLE RATING: 3/5

DOTTY FOR DOTS

Polka Dot Wheelie Bag, £34.99, lakeland.co.uk

This is a Tardis of a trolley. In spite of its apparently small size, it has a 40-litre capacity.

Its clever design means you can either remove or drop the handle to carry it as a relatively normal-looking tote bag.

The top and the front and back pockets all zip up, so it feels secure, and there’s a side pocket for a brolly.

It doesn’t feel as sturdy as some of the larger trolleys, though —and that pink bow looks cheap.

STYLE RATING: 2/5

CHEAP AND CHEERFUL

Knalla shopping trolley, £22, ikea.com

There’s no denying that this trolley is a budget option.

Yes, the pattern is cheerful. But the 42-litre bag feels a little flimsy and, over the drawstring fastener, the flap is held down with little plastic twist-locks that feel as if they might snap off if used too vigorously.

Yet for £22 it’s not bad value and features a convenient adjustable handle that works like those on suitcase trolleys, so it will suit both dainty women and their taller sisters.

Its two rubber wheels have decent treads so it should have grip on a muddy day, and although it rattles somewhat cheaply when moved around, it would be great for occasional use.

The removable interior pocket is a nice touch to avoid scrabbling around for small items such as keys or purses, and there’s an extra flat zip pocket on the back of the bag which would be handy for a newspaper or magazine.

STYLE RATING: 3/5

FRENCH FANCY 

Perigot market trolley, £63.50, selfridges.com

This trolley from chic French homewares brand Perigot is all about understated style.

It feels contemporary thanks to the nicely finished details such as slender handles, double stitching on the bag, a soft foam grip, two very smooth-rolling wheels and a minimalist aesthetic. The laminated waxed canvas makes the bag seem waterproof and hardy, and it looks smaller than its 40-litre capacity — there’s plenty of room to stuff it with mineral water bottles.

It has an internal pocket for small items and a side pocket for an umbrella — though it would probably be better with a zip over it to keep the rain out. Then again, that would ruin those pared-back, utilitarian-chic lines.

The main drawback? In colour and fabric, it’s ever so slightly Royal Mail.

STYLE RATING: 3/5

STEADY CRUISER

Typhoon shopping trolley, £54, debenhams.com

This two-wheeled trolley from Typhoon feels solid and well-made, and is easy to fold away. The 40-litre bag is sturdy, too.

Even better, it has an inner insulated bag with a drawstring top that allows you to separate cold or hot products and keeps them at the right temperature, making it a great choice for the big supermarket shop.

The main bag also pulls tight with a drawstring, but the Velcro fastening is less than secure and strangely positioned — one side of the Velcro runs horizontally and one vertically, so it holds only lightly in the centre.

The bag feels agile, though, looks a little more eye-catching and cheerful than most trolleys, and there’s no rattle at all on the wheels — you certainly won’t get the wild careering of the average supermarket trolley.

STYLE RATING: 4/5

RETRO HIT

Coates willow basket trolley, £76.10, englishwillowbaskets.co.uk

This will certainly create a stir at the farmers’ market: it’s made in Somerset from willow grown in the county’s wetlands using methods this family company has employed since 1819.

Wicker is incredibly long-lasting if looked after and this is a sturdy item — and although its lack of cover reduces its practicality on rainy days, it is perfect for holding a bunch of flowers without crushing them.

It’s a lovely, tactile object and, as it’s not too tall, there’s no scrabbling around for lost items. Best of all is its strong walking-stick handle and stand.
