A letter written by novelist Rudyard Kipling, in which he appears to admit he plagiarised part of one of his best known works has been unearthed.

The one-page autographed letter, written in 1895, addressed to an unknown woman, makes reference to the famous Laws of the Jungle, included in one of his most famous and well-loved novels, The Jungle Book.

In the letter, Kipling admits it is 'extremely possible' he helped himself 'promiscuously' to others peoples' ideas, but that he cannot remember 'from whose stories I have stolen.'

The letter is set to be sold for £2,500 at auction.

The author, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907, was at one time believed to be the highest-paid writer in the world.

His works include The Jungle Books, Kim and the Just So Stories.

The letter, which is being sold by Andruiser Autographs, reads: 'I have been absent from home for some days. Hence the delay in answering yours of no date, in regard to my account of the Law of the Jungle.

'I am afraid that all that code in its outlines has been manufactured to meet "the necessities of the case": though a little of it is bodily taken from (Southern) Esquimaux rules for the division of spoils.

'In fact, it is extremely possible that I have helped myself promiscuously but at present cannot remember from whose stories I have stolen.

'Very sincerely, Rudyard Kipling.'

Autograph expert Adam Andrusier said: 'Letters by Kipling that mention his most enduring work are extremely rare.'

Born in Bombay, Rudyard Kipling was named after Rudyard Lake, Staffordshire, a beauty spot his parents visited.

Kipling was the first English-language writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, at 42, and is still its youngest ever recipient.

He died in 1936 and his ashes were buried at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.

The Jungle Book is one of the most loved children's books in the English language.

In 2010, a rare proof edition of the classic was discovered that revealed the book was dedicated to his baby daughter Josephine in 1894 who was just one year old. She died just five years later of pneumonia.

Joseph Rudyard Kipling was born in 1865 in Bombay to his British colonial parents, John and Alice Kipling. His father was an artist and worked at the Jeejeebhoy School Of Art in Bombay.

When Kipling was six, his mother decided he needed an English education and sent him to live with a foster family, the Holloways, while he attended school in Southsea. Mrs Holloway beat and bullied him and he struggled to fit in at school, finding comfort only in books.

At the age of 11, Kipling was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, so a family friend contacted his mother and she rushed over from India and removed him from the Holloways' clutches.

After finishing his schooling in Devon, Kipling returned to India to work on a local newspaper. He also began to write short stories, and published a collection of them, entitled Plain Tales From The Hills, in 1888, just after his 22nd birthday.

As Kipling's writing career burgeoned, he returned to England. His arrival in London was met with great acclaim, and he met and became friends with American agent and publisher Wolcott Balestier, at around the same time as he published The Light That Failed.

Kipling fell in love with Balestier's sister Carrie, and married her in London in 1891.  The newlyweds moved to America and had a baby girl, Josephine, shortly after settling in Vermont in a house called Bliss Cottage.

It was in this cottage that Kipling began work on what would become the Jungle Books - he had an idea about a boy who was brought up by wolves.

In four years Kipling produced a series of Jungle Books, and a second daughter, Elsie, was born in 1896.  His tales of and for children won huge acclaim, and by the age of 32, Kipling was the highest-paid writer in the world.

A legal scandal sent the Kiplings back 
to England, and another child, a son, John, was born in 1897. But 
tragedy struck when the Kiplings sailed back across the Atlantic to 
visit Carrie's mother: Rudyard and his elder daughter became seriously 
ill with pneumonia, and the child died.  It was said Kipling never got 
over the tragedy.

Batemans, a National Trust property in East Sussex, which was the home of Rudyard Kipling from 1902 to 1936

The Kiplings returned to England and the picaresque novel Kim was serialised in a magazine and then published in book form in 1901.

In 1902 Kipling bought Batemans, a house dating back to 1634.  Here, the author published his Just So Stories, which he had crafted for his late daughter as he put her to bed.

In 1907 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature - the first English-language recipient - and in 1906 he published Puck Of Pook's Hill and Rewards And Fairies, which contained the poem If, came in 1910.

In 1915 Kipling travelled to France to report on the First World War. In October of that year the family heard Kipling's son John had gone missing in France but no trace of him was found. Kipling felt so guilty about encouraging his son to sign up, he went to France to search for him but no trace was ever found.

Kipling continued to write but, with two of his three children dead, he lost the will to write the children's stories that had made his name.
