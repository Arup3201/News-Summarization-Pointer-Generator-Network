The first Test between Australia and India will now take place in Adelaide on December 9 following the death last week of Phillip Hughes.

The series was supposed to start in Brisbane on Thursday but has been delayed and the venue switched to give grief-stricken players more time to recover, with Hughes' funeral taking place on Wednesday.

The Australian and Indian cricket boards considered a range of options in conjunction with the players' union, including cancelling the Brisbane Test altogether, before opting for a reshuffle.

Third Test (Melbourne) - December 26

Fourth Test (Sydney) - January 6 

Adelaide, which was due to host the second Test from December 12-16, will now host the series opener from December 9-13, in what is sure to be a highly emotional occasion.

Brisbane will now host the second Test from December 17-21 while the third Test will proceed as planned from Boxing Day-December 30 in Melbourne.

The fourth and final Test will still take place in Sydney in the new year, but will start on January 6, three days later than originally scheduled.

Hughes died in a Sydney hospital last Thursday, two days after he was struck in the head by a short-pitched delivery during a domestic first-class match.

His death has triggered an outpouring of emotion, sympathy and support from inside and outside the cricketing world.

The funeral for the left-hander, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, will be held in his hometown of Macksville in New South Wales.
