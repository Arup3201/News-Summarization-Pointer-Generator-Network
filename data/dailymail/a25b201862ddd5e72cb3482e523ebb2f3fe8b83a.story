While there are plenty other attractions - from over 6,000 live animals to a slew of free concerts - the Florida State Fair has become notorious for its food.

Or, perhaps more accurately, for what new delicious thing can be deep fried or wrapped in bacon. 

And 2015 will be no different.

Opening Thursday, the menu for this year's fair is headlined by a Funnel Cake Burger - a beef patty with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickle served between two crunchy glazed funnel cakes, according to The Tampa Tribune.

Gut-busting: The Funnel Cake burger - a bacon cheeseburger wedged between two funnel cakes - is one of three unusual (and high fattening) chosen to appear at the Florida State Fair, which opens this week

Old favorite: Funnel cakes - a known carnival and event treat - are made by pouring batter into hot cooking oil and are usually served with icing sugar

Funnel cakes are essentially drizzles of batter that have been deep fried, and are usually served dusted with icing sugar.

Its a fitting new item from the fair, which first became famous for its Krispy Kreme donut burger. 

According to Spark People, one serving of funnel cakes serves up 44 grams of fat and 88 grams of carbohydrates, giving a total 760 calories.

Add to that the contents of the burger - such as the one served up by Five Guys -  and the funnel cake burger gives you an estimated total of 97 grams of fat and a whopping 1420 calories. 

But the greasiness doesn't stop there. 

Knocked out: The Deep Fried Oreo Burger was not chosen to appear at this year's fair after a public vote

Two other burgers made the official fair menu after a public vote.

The Parmesan Crusted Burger is a twice fried patty coated with a potato chip and parmesan-Romano cheese mixture melted over the top.

The third, the Jalapeno Crusted Burger, is a similar creation, but with a corn chip, jalapeno and Mexican cheese mix, plus guacamole, salsa and sour cream.

Another strong contender, the Deep-Fried Oreo Burger, was cut during the public vote.

The burger consisted of a beef patty that, after being grilled, is slathered in Oreo cookie batter and deep fried.

Bacon and other toppings are then added, and it is served on a regular hamburger bun.

Also cut the Holiday Express Burger -  featuring Thanksgiving dressing, sweet potato fries and a cranberry orange marmalade sauce - and the Burger of the Gods, which had  brie cheese,  bacon and a maple cinnamon apple compote. 

Huge: The Amish Doughnut (picutred) is described as being 'the size of a child's head'

Besides burgers, there's also the popular pastry menu.

Making its debut this year is the cronut, a mix between a croissant and a donut first developed by the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York.

Alongside the cronut is the Amish Doughnut, which is described as incredibly similar to a glazed doughnut, only topped with icing and sprinkles and is 'the size of a child’s head'.
