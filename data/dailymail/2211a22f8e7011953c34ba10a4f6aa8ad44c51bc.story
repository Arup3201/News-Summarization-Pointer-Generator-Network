Sam Allardyce says Louis van Gaal didn’t offer him a drink after West Ham’s defeat at Manchester United last weekend.

After United’s 2-1 victory at Old Trafford, the West Ham manager waited to have a drink with Van Gaal – a tradition Sir Alex Ferguson was fond of during his reign – but no offer was forthcoming from the Dutchman.

And Allardyce says he was 'disappointed' by the snub.

Allardyce recalls Sir Alex Ferguson always extended the courtesy of a glass of wine after the game

Writing in his column in theEvening Standard, the Hammers boss said: 'I always invite the visiting manager into my office for a drink and a chat after a home game. 

'Which is why I was surprised and, yes, disappointed, that there was no such invitation following our match at Old Trafford last weekend.

'When all was done and dusted after the match, I went to where Sir Alex Ferguson was invariably waiting with a glass of wine — and everything had changed. I think the room is now used for analysis.

'I was told it didn’t happen any more, so I said “fair enough” and left.'

United have agreed personal terms with Radamel Falcao over a proposed summer transfer

Meanwhile, United have already agreed the personal terms of a proposed summer transfer for loan signing Radamel Falcao in a bid to avoid a repeat of the wage wrangle they had with Carlos Tevez five years ago.

United signed the Colombia centre forward on loan from Monaco on the last day of the summer transfer window.

Having paid a loan fee of £6million to the French club for the 28-year-old, United have also agreed to a transfer fee of £43.5m if they decide to take the striker permanently at the end of the season.
