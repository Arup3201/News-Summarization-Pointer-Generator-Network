Ellie Simmonds’s swimming showdown is back on.

The poster girl of the Paralympics looks set to take on rival Victoria Arlen on Saturday, after the American was reinstated in her category following an appeal.

World record holder Arlen, 17, was ruled ‘ineligible’ for the Games on Monday, as her impairment was not deemed severe enough to qualify for her allocated category.

But the International Paralympic Committee yesterday upheld the American team’s appeal and said she would be allowed to compete in the same ‘S6’ swimming classification as Simmonds.

Simmonds became known as the darling of the pool at Beijing in 2008, when she won golds in the 100m and 400m freestyle at the age of just 13.

Now 17, Simmonds, who has dwarfism, is hoping to defend those titles against Arlen, who broke both of her world records at the US trials in June.

The American was paralysed in 2006 by a virus which affected her spinal cord and left her in a vegetative state for two years.

On Saturday she will face Simmonds in the heats of the 400m freestyle, with a final decision as to her classification being made after this contest.

Before the Games, Simmonds named Arlen as her greatest rival, telling the BBC: ‘It’s given me a bit of a buzz really, a bit of determination.

‘I’m a very competitive person and being behind the blocks, knowing that she is the world record holder and that I have to beat her, is really exciting.’

Simmonds is competing for four medals,  in the 50m, 100m and 400m freestyle and the 200m individual medley.

And the pressure is on – following her double gold in Beijing, she was named the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, and became the youngest person ever to be awarded the MBE.

Speaking about this year’s Games, she said: ‘Four years ago it was all new for me.

'Now I know coming into the Games what a Paralympics is like, how big an event it is.

'It’s definitely going to be a big event being at a home Games.

'It’s exciting, but it’s quite scary.’
