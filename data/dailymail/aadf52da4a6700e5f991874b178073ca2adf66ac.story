Emergency dispatchers are constantly dealing with annoying accidental calls.

But, thanks to a savvy call center operator, a 911 pocket dial on Saturday lead police to a major drug operation bust.

The worker stayed on the line for almost half-an-hour listening to people'talking about making and selling methamphetamine', according to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun.

The operator sent police to an address in Deltona, Florida, updating the officers en route from what she was hearing, including a 'bubbling sound as if something was cooking'.

Family duo: Donna Knope, 55, her son Jason Knope, 32, were allegedly busted cooking meth in a shed at the back of their home in Deltona, Florida, on Saturday after accidentally calling 911

Accomplice: Thomas Stallings, 41, was arrested with the mother-son duo. Inside the shed police allege they found drug-making paraphernalia such as coffee filters, a butane torch, batteries, drain opener hypodermic needles and lighter fluid

Arriving at the residence about 12.31am, cops found a shed out back that had white smoke coming from it.

Peering through the windows they realized the structure was a clandestine methamphetamine lab.

'(The officers)  observed Thomas Stallings and Donna Knope sitting in chairs facing a second male later identified as Jason Knope, who was working on something on the work bench,' the report said.

'There was a green plastic bottle wrapped in plastic wrap, a butane torch, and a zip lock bag with a white powdery residue on the work bench.'

The officers said the bottle was smoking.

Donna Knope, 55, her son Jason Knope, 32, and Thomas Stallings, 41, were caught off guard when the officers stormed the shed.

All three were arrested and charged with manufacture and possession of methamphetamine with intent to sell or deliver.

Scene: The shed was located at the back of this home at 3281 Roland Drive, Deltona, on Saturday night

A search of the shed produced'all of the makings of an active meth lab, including coffee filters, a butane torch, batteries, drain opener, plastic tubing, hypodermic needles, lithium strips, lighter fluid, plastic bags and numerous plastic bottles containing a white substance', Smoking Gun noted.

Knope - who was denied bail - and her son live in the house at 3281 Roland Drive.

Stallings, who lives at a separate address, is on probation in connection with a burglary conviction.

The meth lab has since been dismantled.
