Temperatures may be cooling but the high street's latest collections are starting to hot up.

New Look is the latest fast-fashion chain to unveil its AW14 collection and there's enough cosy knits, dusky pink coats and sparkling metallics to take you through to next year in style.

Taking inspiration from the catwalks, New Look has curated smooth and futuristic fabrics with bold linear patterns, flashes of on-trend pink and bold animal prints.

Tis the season to be cosy: New Look has taken some serious inspiration from the catwalks this season, where comfort is key. The pink coat is still a wardrobe staple so if you haven't got one to recycle from last season, there's never been a better time to invest 

As Stella McCartney, Celine and just about every other designer proved, this season is all about monster knits with chunky knitwear and felted wool in gritty khaki tones and it seems that New Look certainly took note. 

Parkas come with furry hoods, cocoon coats in bold checks and pastels and over-sized boyfriend coats in mannish checks and if you're feeling the chill, faux fur scarves, snoods and stoles will warm you up and add a sensual finish to the simplest of outfits.

Boyfriend jeans and acid washes update the denim collections for wearable streetwear a la Rita Ora and footwear has been toughened up with chunky soles and on-trend metal hardware.

Check mate: Co-ords make up a lot of the collection and it's all about plaid fabrics this season

Fix up, look sharp: This season is all about sharp tailoring and the trouser suit has been given a feminine makeover with loose cuts and soft dove grey shading, left, while outerwear comes with checks and cosy finishes 

Flower power: Winter dresses can be dressed down with tights and flats or up with heels and a leather jacket for a night out on the town

The high street giant have also included plenty of partywear for all those festive soirées. Inspired by the late 1960s, dresses come in lush velvets and shimmering metallics covered with embellishment 

Speaking about the latest drop, Lydia Jones, fashion blogger and founder of Want Her Wardrobe, said: 'This is a strong season for New Look and their campaign imagery is super slick with some real trend-led pieces.

'I love the eye-catching fringing and flashes of fluoro and can't wait to wrap up warm in a cosy snood.' 

It's a wrap: Parkas come with furry hoods, cocoon coats in bold checks and pastels and over-sized boyfriend coats in mannish checks

Bling bling: Garments and accessories are given added drama with jewels, crystals, tassels and fringing this season 

Winter chills: Boyfriend jeans come ripped and acid washed, while T-shirts are emblazoned with slogans
