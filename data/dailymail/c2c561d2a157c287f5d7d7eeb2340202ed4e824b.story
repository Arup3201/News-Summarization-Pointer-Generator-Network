From the Simpsons and the Flintstones, to Snow White and Wonder Woman, one artist has put a disturbing spin on the animated lives of America's favorite cartoon characters.

No Violence Against Women is a project intended to throw the issue of domestic abuse into the spotlight, by forcing us to confront what goes on behind the happy veneer of many real-life families and relationships.

Italian artist and activist AleXsandro Palombo, 40, who is based in Milan, tells MailOnline: 'I wanted to give visibility to a problem that affects a great amount of women all over the world.'

Unsettling: Italian artist and activist AleXsandro Palombo has re-imagined iconic cartoon characters in domestic violence situations, to raise awareness for violence against women

The artist, who is famous for his thought-provoking satirical work, chose 'the most iconic cartoon characters of all time' to illustrate his point, and released the images in honor of International Women's Day earlier this year.

His cast includes a bloodied Snow White at the feet of Prince Charming and a battered Marge Simpson standing dejectedly next to her husband Homer, who, like fellow fictional patriarchs Fred Flintstone and Peter Griffin, grins vacantly beside his wife as if nothing is amiss.

The only male figure who looks conventionally menacing is Popeye, who wears his trademark scowl, and perhaps the smiling Fred Flintstone, who, on closer inspection, is gripping his baton shiftily behind his back.

One banner bears the stark question: 'What Kind of Man are You?'

Such challenging art generally sparks a divided response, but regardless of how the message is conveyed or received, violence against women remains a profound issue all over the world.

'Domestic violence is a problem so widespread that its victims and perpetrators could be anyone,' Mr Palombo says. 'Even in couples that appear to be normal.'

Popeye and Olive Oil: The images are undoubtedly disturbing, and, like other famous re-worked cartoon art before it, is likely to trigger polarized reactions

Rampant problem: 'Domestic violence is a problem so widespread that its victims and perpetrators could be anyone,' Mr Palombo says

According to DomesticViolence.org, one woman in the U.S. is beaten or assaulted every nine seconds.

Furthermore, domestic violence is classed as the leading cause of injury to women in the U.S - more than car accidents, muggings, and sexual assaults combined.

And sadly, based on government reports, between 55per cent and 95per cent of women who have been physically abused by their partners never contact non-governmental organizations, shelters, or the police for help.

What kind of man are you? Mr Palombo has used Disney princesses and other famous cartoon character in much of his political or social artistic statements in the past

For Mr Palombo, its not the first time Disney characters have appeared in his provocative work. Earlier this year, he published a project entitled Do You Still Like Us? - which saw Pocahontas, Cinderella and Snow White, amongst others, in wheelchairs or with crutches and missing limbs.

The artist, who lost his own leg to cancer two years ago, gained wide applause for raising awareness around the subject of people with disabilities.

Earlier works dive into the morally-fraught fashion world, including an image depicting Vogue editor Anna Wintour clutching a butcher's knife and a rabbit's head - a reference to her outspoken obsession with fur - and another which sees designer Victoria Beckham as a bikini-clad skeleton, entitled Anorexic Fashion Icon.
