An American filmmaker has attempted to recapture something that is inevitably lost with time – the ability to see the world through the eyes of a child.

Attaching a GoPro camera to his son, the man from Denver, Colorado threw him in the air a number of times to record footage of his perspective.

Explaining his idea at the start of the video, the dad says: ‘I was always curious what JJ saw when we threw him in the air.

‘So we are going to put the GoPro on the baby and throw him in the air, and then I’m going to let him see my side.’

The dad gets the experiment underway after counting down from three and the youngster begins laughing in excitement.

The camera picks up the sense of speed as the baby is propelled from the father’s arms before stopping in the air and returning to him safely.

Up, up and away! The baby's perspective captures the snowy garden, the dog and his dad awaiting his return

Catching a view of the whole garden, the camera picks up the surrounding snow, the shadows from the tree, the dog looking upwards curiously and the father awaiting his son’s landing.

After throwing and catching his son a few times, the video maker attaches the camera to himself and repeats the process, capturing the game from his perspective.

Holding his son in his hands, the youngster bobs in and out of shot on the three count before he is propelled upwards into the air.

The youngster looks thrilled after being repeatedly thrown into the air and caught by his father

Stretching out his arms for balance, the youngster looks a mixture of thrilled and nervous as he comes hurtling back down to earth and into his father’s hands.

The video concludes with the video maker holding his son in his stretched arms while he spins around on the spot.

The youngster opens his mouth and laughs in enjoyment as the garden twirls around him before his father throws him into the air a final two times.
