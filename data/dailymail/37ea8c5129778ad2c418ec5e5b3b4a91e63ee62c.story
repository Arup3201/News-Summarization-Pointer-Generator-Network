It's believed the two were asleep in a first-level apartment at the time of the incident, with a concrete slab from the second floor falling on top of them.

Crews used hydraulic jacks and lifting blocks to lift the concrete enough to get to them.

Five children and two adults were taken to UAB Hospital earlier on following the pre-dawn explosion.

They had to crawl through fire and debris to reach safety.

'This explosion was a tragedy for the family and this community,' said Birmingham Police Chief A.C. Roper.

'There are so many other things that could have gone wrong in the response and rescue effort but our public safety personnel really demonstrated their skill and expertise in this operation.'

Mayor William Bell visited the scene earlier this morning and prayed with victim's families, Mardis said.

'I came out and the whole building was on fire.'

'I thought an airplane had crashed down here.'

Taris Richardson, who said he has lived in the community for 20 years, said the smell of gas has been a problem in the apartment complex going back three years, especially during the summer and at a building adjacent to one that exploded.

The Salvation Army were onsite to provide food and water to firefighters and those affected/

Residents in the immediate area have been complaining that their water is muddy and undrinkable, however Mardis said that can happen when firefighting, because fire hoses pull a large volume of water and can stir up sediment in the system.

'We will have some dirt in the lines,' he said.

An investigation will properly determine what caused the blast.
