With no running water, clashes at soup kitchens for supplies and accommodation in the form of hole-ridden tents, it’s an unthinkable standard of living.

And these photographs show the shocking conditions faced by up to 2,000 African and Middle Eastern migrants eager for a new life in Britain.

The camp in Calais - which has come to be known as Jungle 2 - houses people desperately trying every night to stow away on lorries bound for the UK.

Police response: Hundreds of desperate refugees from Africa and the Middle East have set up the squalid new Jungle 2 camp

Close to Britain: While previously, many have come from Afghanistan, the majority of this new migrant influx are from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan

Mohammed Atasi, 31, has spent eight weeks at the camp and has been stopped five times by border officials trying to board lorries.

His family - including wife Nadia, 30, and their three young children - have already fled war-torn Homs in Syria, and made it to England in April.

Mr Atasi told Russell Myers of the Daily Mirror: ‘I don’t know when I will see them again. We are living like animals here.

‘Why does no one care? I used to work as a chef at a five-star hotel. Now I am living in borrowed clothes.’

Cleaning: Estimates by French authorities suggest at least 35 are successful in crossing the Channel every day, but at least 1,200 migrants remain in the town

Nourishment: Migrants fleeing poverty and war in Africa and the Middle East arrive in Calais with hopes of crossing the Channel on a ferry or on trucks laden with cargo

Tomatoes in hand: Their numbers in the Channel port have swelled to up to 2,000, overwhelming the city, aid agencies and police

New arrivals: Deputy Mayor Philippe Mignonet recently said Calais 'has been taken hostage'

Hopeful: Britain is seen by many migrants as Europe's Shangri-La, with a more humane treatment of migrants than continental neighbors like France

Last week the Daily Mail reported how migrants in Calais clashed in a turf war as tensions in the illegal camp spilled over into violence.

Riot police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to contain the hundreds of men as they fought running battles early last Tuesday morning.

The rival groups from Sudan and Eritrea are battling for control of an area of land which is the best location for attempting to get into UK-bound lorries.

It comes as a leaked police memo revealed French authorities are ‘alarmed’ by the soaring number of migrants arriving in the country.

Giving them food: A spokesman for aid group Secours Catholique in Calais, said there is 'lots more tension' at the camp at the moment

Shaving in the open: Mayor Mignonet has blamed in part a Franco-British cooperation accord that he says puts the brunt of the burden on Calais

Rising figures: In the first six months of last year 7,913 migrants arrived in Italy, and the number was 4,301 in 2012

Working together: The migrants want outsmart scanners, CO2 detectors and other technology used on trucks and planted through the Channel Tunnel

Most have made their way from Italy after escaping East Africa. Some 61,591 migrants landed in Italy in the first six months of this year.

The trouble in the camp has been rumbling on since last Sunday night after groups of the young men clashed at a soup kitchen for supplies.

While previously, many have come from Afghanistan, the majority of this new migrant influx are from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan.

Estimates by French authorities suggest at least 35 are successful in crossing the Channel every day, but at least 1,200 migrants remain in the town.
