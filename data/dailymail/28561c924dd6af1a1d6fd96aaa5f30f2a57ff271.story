Fears: Nick Clegg said he worried the U.S. and Israel may 'take matters into their own hands' and launch a pre-emptive strike against Iran

Iran is developing a missile with a 6,200-mile range capable of reaching Britain, it was revealed yesterday.

The rogue state’s new weapon could also deliver an attack as far away as America’s East Coast.

Israel’s deputy prime minister Moshe Ya’alon made the chilling claim as his country’s military chiefs revealed Tehran had stockpiled enough enriched uranium to produce four nuclear warheads.

Nick Clegg last night expressed concern 
that the U.S. and Israel would ‘take matters into their own hands’ and 
launch a military strike against Iran.

The West fears that Iran will equip its missiles with nuclear devices.

Defence sources in Tel Aviv predicted there could be a strike against the Iranian regime as early as this summer.

Yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘I worry that certain countries might take matters into their own hands.’

Iran insists it is developing atomic technology for civilian purposes.

Military chiefs in Israel announced that Tehran had stockpiled enough enriched uranium to produce four nuclear bombs.

Mr Clegg spoke out as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned Israel to resolve the standoff with Iran peacefully.

Asked if he was concerned that Israel would attack Iran, the LibDem leader said: ‘Of course I worry that there will be a military conflict and that certain countries might take matters into their own hands.’

He said Britain had been attempting to demonstrate that ‘there are very tough things we can do which are not military steps in order to place pressure on Iran.’

Last week the European Union agreed to tougher economic sanctions, including an embargo on Iranian oil exports, over its failure to abandon its nuclear programme.

Iran threatened to retaliate by closing the Strait of Hormuz, which channels one-fifth of the world’s crude oil, prompting Britain to warn it would send military reinforcements to the Gulf if the international waterway was blocked.

The Royal Navy already has five ships there with HMS Daring, one of its sophisticated new Type 45 destroyers, on its way.

Mr Clegg refused to speculate if Britain would ‘participate’ in military action. But he said: ‘Of course, in a situation like this you don’t take any options off the table.

‘When you are involved in a major standoff with a country which appears to have a... hostile intent on these issues, of course you don’t do that.’

Meanwhile, Israel’s deputy prime minister Moshe Ya’alon told a security conference that Iran was successfully building long-distance ballistic missiles.

He said the weapons, with a range of 10,000km (6,200miles), were ‘aimed at America, not us’ although a missile that could be fired such a distance could also strike Britain.

Mr Ya’alon said: ‘Such a non-conventional regime should not have such non-conventional capabilities.’

He told the annual Herzliya national security conference in Israel that an Iranian military compound that mysteriously exploded on November 12 last year was developing long-range missiles.

At least 17 people, including a general, died in a blast on the base around 20miles west of Tehran. Iran said an ammunition dump had exploded but the destruction was widely blamed on foreign intelligence services.

Major-General Aviv Kochavi, Israel’s chief of military intelligence, said that Iran could make four atomic bombs by enriching uranium it had already stockpiled.

He said that from the moment Iran’s spiritual leaders ‘give an order... to speed up production of the first nuclear explosive device, we estimate it will take about a year to complete the task.’
