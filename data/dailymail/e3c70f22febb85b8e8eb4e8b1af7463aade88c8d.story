Buddhist monks arriving at an event to the sound of chanting and bells isn't outside the realm of possibilities for most people.

But a crowd at New York's Union Square got the shock of their lives when four 'monks' broke from their solemn, statuette poses and started breakdancing to the Beastie Boys hit song Ch-Check It Out.

The performance was produced to raise awareness for 'MCA Day', an annual event which honours the life of deceased Beastie Boy Adam 'MCA' Yauch.

The four dancers – identified as Franklin Chen, Jason Ng, Erich Reyes and Stephen Pyo – start their performance by solemnly entering Union Square dressed in robes, with their hands in a prayer-like motion.

To the sound of bells and chanting, the men each make their way to a corner of the makeshift dancefloor – a black and white mat, featuring a logo promoting ‘MCA Day’ in the square's centre.

Once in place, the group bow their heads, while the chanting and bells continue playing.

Suddenly, the Beastie Boys hit song ‘Ch-Check It Out’ starts to play and the ‘monks’ break from their solemn stances and start busting their moves.

Buddhist monks may seem like a strange way to advertise an annual memorial day for Yauch, who died in 2012 following a long battle with cancer.

However, the former Beastie Boy was a practicing Buddhist and supporter of Tibetan Independence, after converting in 1994.

Frank Anselmo, the man behind the video and creative director of New York-based advertising firm KNARF, claims he and his crew spent six months planning the stunt.

On the question of whether or not the monks really are men of the robe, Mr Anselmo told the New York Daily News: ‘Of course they're not real monks.’

After auditioning several breakdancers, the team eventually narrowed it down to four that would be willing to shave their heads.

Identical robes to the ones worn by the Dalai Lama were also ordered from Nepal.

Having grown up in New York, Mr Anselmo idolised the Beastie Boys – who were also born and raised in the city.

The third annual MCA Day took place in Brooklyn on Saturday.
