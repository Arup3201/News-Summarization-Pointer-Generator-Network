West Ham United have signed Marseille midfielder Morgan Amalfitano for £1million.

Amalfitano, who spent last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion, signs on a three-year deal, the French club confirmed.

The Frenchman has one cap for his country, and played 31 times in the Premier League last season, scoring four times.

Deal done: Sam Allardyce shakes hands with Morgan Amalfitano as he arrives at the club

Amalfitano told the club's website: 'It's very good news and I'm very happy to come to this big club.

'I've waited a long time, but I am very happy to have signed here. The Club wanted me a lot and for that I waited for West Ham and now I'm here.

'The manager explained to me how the team plays and how he needs me. I explained to him where I prefer as my position in his team. This is a new team with very good players with great experience of this league. I think everything can go well and I hope we have a good season.

'I prefer to play behind the striker, but last year with West Brom I played on the right. I like to cross the ball too, but I can also give through passes from behind the striker. 

'The coach will see what happens in every game and if he finds another position for me in the team, there is no problem for me.

Back then: Amalfitano played 31 times in the Premier League for West Brom, scoring four times

'I enjoyed my first year in English football and for that reason I have come back and hopefully I can improve again. The first year was good for my experience and I will try to help West Ham now by giving my best and continue to improve in this league. I like this country and this is the best league.'

Amalfitano joins Mauro Zarate, Carl Jenkinson, Alex Song, Diego Poyet, Aaron Cresswell, Enner Valencia, Cheikhou Kouyate and Diafra Sakho as the Hammers' summer signings.

West Ham have won once this season, and lost 3-1 to Southampton on Saturday at Upton Park.
