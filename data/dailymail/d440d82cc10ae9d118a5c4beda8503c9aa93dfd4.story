The wife of the new Bank of England governor has suggested that her family is struggling to to find a place live in London - despite his £874,000 pay packet.

Diana Carney publicly bemoaned that an influx of wealthy French fleeing their socialist president’s hefty taxes has led to a lack of suitable housing in the capital.

Mark Carney, a former £1 million a year Goldman Sachs banker, is taking up the Bank of England governor’s post this July. He will receive a £250,000 housing allowance - or £5,000 a week.

Mrs Carney tweeted a link to a story about how France’s President Hollande is scaling back taxes on the rich, with the remarks: ‘Maybe I’ll be able to find a place to live in London after all.’

With a housing allowance of £5,000 a week, they can certainly afford to look at some of the most exclusive addresses in London.

Mrs Carney - who runs a left-wing think tank Canada2020 and has praised the anti-capitalist Occupy protest movement - also signalled she expected to take part in policy-making in the UK.

Speaking in a TV interview broadcast on Sunday, she said: ‘My husband was brought in to bring new ideas and fresh thinking to the Bank of England, and I would hope that I can bring some ideas from Canada in the policy environment and learn from the UK, but also inject some perhaps new thinking in some of the areas with which we’re mutually dealing with the same issues.’

She cited income inequality as her top priority and also signalled that she hoped to work with Nick Clegg.

‘It’s been a big priority for the Deputy Prime Minister and they have a commission on what they call social mobility and I hope that I can continue working in this area and see if we can make some headway,’ she told Canada’s Global News programme, The West Block with Tom Clark.

Before his appointment at the Bank of England, Mr Carney - the current governor of the Bank of Canada - was approached to become leader of the Canadian Liberals - a sister party of the Liberal Democrats.

His wife’s remarks about the struggle to find accommodation in Britain sparked dismay from campaigners.

John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the influential Treasury select committee, said: ‘Her husband is getting a housing allowance that is more than many of my constituents earn in ten years. I would be happy to help her find suitable accommodation. I’m prepared to move out of my London flat for her which will be available at just four per cent of her housing allowance.’

Robert Oxley, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘While Diana Carney clearly recognises that punitive rates of taxation across the Channel are going to send people flocking to London, not many of us are lucky enough to have a taxpayer funded allowance to subsidise our homes.’

Mrs Carney, who was born in Britain, also said she was braced for interest from the public as part of a power couple. Asked if she could deal with press interest, she said: ‘We’ll do our best. I think we’re both pretty confident in who we are.’ The couple met at Oxford where they both played hockey.

A daughter of a wealthy pig farmer, she attended the £31,000-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire before gaining a first in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St John’s College, Oxford.

During a grilling by the Treasury select committee last year, Mr Carney defended his remuneration package, which includes a salary of £624,000. This is £144,000 more than the current governor, Mervyn King, because Mr Carney has declined to have a pension.

‘The housing allowance relates to the fact that I’m moving from one of the cheapest capitals [Ottawa] to one of the most expensive capitals,’ he said.

‘It’s a relatively common arrangement for senior executives.’

Mr Carney will start his Threadneedle Street role on 1 July 2013.
