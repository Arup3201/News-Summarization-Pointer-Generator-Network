A Humpty Dumpty statue sitting on the wall of an Oregon theme park fell and smashed into pieces -  just like in the famous nursery rhyme.

Humpty Dumpty fell on Saturday at Enchanted Forest in Turner, according to KOIN6.

Happier times: The statue of Humpty Dumpty is seen before his fatal fall

Enchanted Forest shared an image on Saturday of the destroyed Humpty Dumpty on the park's Facebook page.

'A sad day at EF! Hopefully we can put him together again! (Thankfully, no one was hurt, except Humpty)' the photo's caption said.

The Enchanted Forest posted an image on Sunday of Humpty Dumpty's sculptor Roger Tofte, 84, looking at where his creation once stood. 

Can he put Humpty back together again? Roger Tofte, who built the statue over 40 years ago, says he will try to build a new one

'Witnesses have told us two adult men tried to climb up on the wall with Humpty Dumpty and accidentally pulled the wall and Humpty down,' the park wrote.

Humpty Dumpty was over 40 years old when he fell, the park said.

'It's true he's old, built before 1970, but he was still very special to us and not a family member we were looking to replace!'

Tofte, who built the theme park, told KOIN6 'It's going to take quite a few hours just to start from scratch again and try and duplicate what I had.

'That's [what] the problem [is] going to be - to make it like it was before. And I'm 84, so I hope I have some creative juices left.'
