Tragedy: Adam Thomas Stewart, 31, was killed by a bear

A Utah man reported missing a week ago has been found dead as the result of a bear attack.

Adam Thomas Stewart, 31, of Virgin, Utah, was in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in central Wyoming checking on a research plot when he was reported missing on Sept. 7.

His body was found between his campsite and the plot on Friday.

According to officials, he was alone.

This the twelfth fatal bear attack in North America this decade, and the eleventh by a wild bear.

The last one occurred on May 7, 2014, when Lorna Weafer was attacked and killed near Fort McMurray, Alberta.

The last attack in Wyoming happened on August 24, 2011, when John Wallace was killed in Yellowstone National Park.

There were two fatal bear attacks in Yellowstone Park in 2011, and in both instances, a grizzly bear was responsible for the death. 

Authorities declined to release what details led them to believe it was a bear attack.

Officials also aren’t certain yet what type of bear killed Stewart.

The coroner says he assumes it was a grizzly, but he doesn't have enough information right now to make that determination.

It has still not been stated what research project Stewart was working on at the time of his death. 

An autopsy is expected later this week. 

There has been no statement from Stewart's family at this time.
