Staff watched children's performances, enjoyed a buffet and listened to speeches as they toasted to the 75th anniversary of one of Russia's most notorious Gulag camps.

The bizarre party to celebrate the founding of a forced labour camp and attended by local officials and former guards gave little indication to the horrors of its past.

Usol'Lag camp in Solikamsk, near the Ural mountains, held both criminal and political prisoners during the Soviet years and was set up during the early Stalinist purges aimed to clean the communist union of those with undesirable political opinions.

Usol'Lag held thousands of political prisoners at any one time and had the higest death rate of any camp under the gulag.

The Gulag was the organisation which ran the forced labour camps during the soviet years and is an acronym for Chief Administration of Corrective Labour Camps and Colonies.

Gulag has also become the noun used to describe the forced labour camps of Soviet Russia.

It was mainly in function from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, 53 separate camps and 423 labour colonies in use in March 1940.

Their camps were spread across Russia and would hold both criminal and political prisoners whose crimes could be anything from stealing a loaf of bread to being suspected of spreading anti-Stalin propaganda.

It is estimated that over 25 million people passed through the Gulag system, either through imprisonment in work camps, deportations or ‘labour colonies’.

Due to the closed system and the common practice to release prisoners as they were about to die, the number of deaths caused by the Gulag has been estimated to 1.6 million, but could be as much as 10 million.

Proudly announcing the anniversary of the camp, the Solikamsky regional department of Russia's prison service said the Stalinist police ‘instilled traditions in the camp that still hold value 
today.'

In a statement released to Russian press yesterday the 'corrective colony' said these proud traditions include 'allegiance to the motherland, mutual assistance and respect for war veterans.'

‘So hard were the times in which the 
Usol'Lag camp was founded, so heavy were the burdens it overcame!’ wrote Sergei
Yerofeyev, deputy chairman of the camp's museum.

Usol'Lag was founded in 1938, and functioned as a timber processing plant.

It held 10,000 to 
30,000 prisoners at any given time, a number which included criminals as well as those convicted of 
‘counter-revolutionary activity’ and other political crimes.

More than 
16 per cent of prisoners died of malnutrition and overwork, one of 
the highest rates in the Gulag.

Following the 1953 death of Joseph Stalin, Usol'Lag transferred its remaining 
political prisoners in 1955 and was closed in 1960.

Horror: Millions of Gulag prisoners died due to the appalling conditions in the working camps, such as wooden planks as beds with only a blanket to protect them against the Siberian climate
