An elderly cancer patient died of an overdose the day after a GP prescribed morphine over the phone, an inquest heard.

Dr Mushkoor Sheikh failed to carry out a home visit to see 80-year-old widow Betty Horsfield.

The next day, she was inadvertently given double the recommended dose of the opiate by her daughter, Dawn Ellis.

Betty Horsfield, 80, died of a morphine overdose the day after Dr Sheikh allegedly refused to carry out a home visit. Her daughter, Dawn Ellis, called the GP because her mother was in agonising pain due to her cancer

A medical expert said this amounted to ‘gross failure’, as morphine should not be prescribed to anyone for the first time without a face-to-face consultation.

Doncaster coroner Nicola Mundy recorded a verdict of misadventure after a two-day inquest and is reporting the doctor to NHS bosses over the death which took place in March, 2010.

Mrs Ellis said afterwards she felt at one time as if she was being blamed for her mother’s death.

She said: ‘I am just so glad someone listened. I am pleased something is going to come out of it.

‘From now on when you ring a doctor they should come out and do a visit. That should be the proper procedure.

‘When they told me she had died from the morphine I felt I’d be blamed. At the end of the day I was managing her pain relief, but it was an accident.’

Mrs Horsfield, from Doncaster, was suffering from breast cancer and had been in agonising pain for four days when her daughter called the Bentley Health Centre.

She asked Dr Sheikh to visit her mother, but he rang her back and said he would instead send a prescription for Oramorph to a chemist.

Instead of carrying out a home visit, Dr Sheikh prescribed morphine over the phone. This was administered by Mrs Horsfield's daughter, Dawn Ellis (pictured posed by model)

The inquest heard that the chemist failed to include the right size spoon for administering liquid morphine.

Mrs Ellis broke down in the witness box as she insisted she had requested a home visit from the GP.

She gave her mother the medication in an attempt to ease her pain but she died as a result - the prescription was for 10ml up to four times a day but Mrs Ellis admitted using a dessert spoon to give her as much as 70ml the day before she died.

A pathologist said Mrs Horsfield died from morphine toxicity.

Dr Sheikh told the inquest he had asked questions of Mrs Ellis and ‘listened to what was reported’ before he decided the only option available was morphine.

He swore on oath about the telephone call. He said: ‘She didn’t ask me for a home visit. I was responding to a request for a patient who was in pain.’

But Dr Alan Crouch, an independent medical expert, said Mrs Horsfield had not been seen by a doctor for six months and she had never before been prescribed morphine.

He said: ‘The bottom line is that this patient needed to be seen and assessed. I think with a patient like Mrs Horsfield who was elderly and infirm it was mandatory.

‘This amounted to a gross failure. I don’t think to prescribe morphine was appropriate. Without going to properly assess the patient it was a serious deficiency.’
