Everton centre-back John Stones has resumed full training and could return to the side to face QPR on Monday.

England international Stones suffered ankle ligament damage in Everton's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United in October which required an operation.

However, the 20 year-old's rehabilitation has gone well and Toffees boss Roberto Martinez revealed he is on the verge of a return.

Stones needed surgery on his ankle ligament injury, but is now on the road to recovery

'John's trained once with the team and he came through that well,' he said.

'It's about introducing him into a competitive game. Its' great to have him back.

'John is ahead of schedule, probably two or three weeks but I would expect that because he's a quick healer. He hasn't stopped one second to make sure he gets back.

'He is desperate to get back on to the football pitch. He started the season well, and sometimes at that age it's difficult to maintain that level.

'Now he is ready to step up the level. He's a phenomenal character.

'We will assess John as well as James McCarthy, Steven Naismith and Darron Gibson before QPR. They are different stages but all four have a chance of being involved.'

Roberto Martinez confirmed that Stones was back in first team training and will be assessed ahead of QPR

Martinez admits QPR will pose a significant threat to his side even though they have struggled on the road this season.

He added: 'I know QPR have Charlie Austin missing but they are in a good moment, we respect them. I admire Harry Redknapp hugely.

'I think everyone knows QPR have had good results at home, and they have been well deserved, away from home they have been unlucky.

'It's an important period for us. Every game is difficult. QPR have found their rhythm and it's not a great time to face them.'
