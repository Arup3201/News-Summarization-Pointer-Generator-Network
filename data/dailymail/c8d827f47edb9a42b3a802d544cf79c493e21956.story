An owner who thought his dog had drowned when a storm destroyed their boat has been reunited with his beloved pet after she swam more than a mile in the dark to find him.

Stephen Alioto, who lived on the boat in Richardson Bay, California with Daisy his pit bull, was ashore in Sausalito without her when a massive storm battered the area last Thursday.

When he returned, all he saw above the water was the boat's mast, and he feared she'd drowned.

But in fact, when the boat started filling up with water, Daisy had scrambled through the hatch  and, remembering swimming lessons her owner had given her, made it to shore.

She then found her way to Sausalito Presbyterian Church, where she and Alioto sometimes went for free meals.

'My neighbor told me there was a soaking wet, shivering dog crouched in the church doorway,' the Reverend Paul Mowry, who is also the police chaplain, told the Mercury News. 'Initially, I thought she was just a lost dog.'

He told the Sausalito police and the Marin Humane Society and an officer scanned Daisy's microchip, which gave them telephone numbers and told them the dog's name was 'Babe'.

When Mowry got through to one of the numbers, the person on the end of the phone said the dog had been given away to a friend named Steve, who had changed her name to Daisy.

'We have a Steve who comes to our free lunches on Wednesday,' Mowry said.

By this point, Alioto had reported his missing dog to police. After hearing about the report, Sergeant Thomas George recalled the lost dog at the church and called Mowry, Mercury News reported.

But Alioto was now homeless and impossible to track down. That's when Mowry's partner, Joe Silverman, suggested they go to location holding the next free meal in the city.

Relief: Alioto said he sobbed when the pastor told him Daisy had turned up outside his church last week

Astonishing: Daisy somehow climbed out of the boat and swam more than a mile in the dark to shore. She headed to the church because she and Alioto sometimes had free meals there, officials believe

The following day, they went to The Open Door Ministries and learned there was a man there telling people his boat sank while his dog was on board. 

'I walked over and said to Steve, "We have your dog." He said, "Are you kidding me?" I told him the dog showed up at the church. He started sobbing and threw his arms around me,' Mowry said.

'I cried so hard,' Alioto told KPIX5.

The following day, Mowry took Alioto to the Humane Society to be reunited with Daisy. He told officers that once he took her in, he had changed her name from Babe.

He told Mowry that, unlike his belongings, Daisy could never be replaced.  

'That dog is his companion,' the pastor said. 'She's his everything.'

Alioto told KPIX5 that he was overjoyed to be reunited with his pet. 

Storm: Alioto's boat was flooded when a huge storm struck Northern California last week. Pictured, children look at a flooded road in Forestville, California last Friday, 50 miles north of where Alioto's boat sank

'I'm big daddy Kibbles and Bits,' he said of their relationship. 'I'm the guy who provides the dog food, the walks, the baths, and everything that she tells me she needs.' 

Daisy and Alioto are now staying on a friend's boat. Strangers visiting the Humane Society gave him a 50-pound bag of food, while the shelter gave Daisy a new collar.

'As they were leaving, a Good Samaritan heard the story and handed some money toward Daisy's care,' said Lisa Bloch of the Humane Society.

'This is a beautiful story and I think it says a lot about our community here in Marin and how much we care about animals and people.'
