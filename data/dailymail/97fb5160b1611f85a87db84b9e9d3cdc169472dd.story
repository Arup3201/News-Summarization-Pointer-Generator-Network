The proportion of Britons with dementia has unexpectedly fallen by about a quarter in the last twenty years

Britons are less likely to develop dementia today than two decades ago, researchers claim.

A major study found the chances of developing the disease in old age has fallen by a quarter since the 1990s.

However, the overall number of dementia sufferers is on the rise because more of us live to an age when the illness is most prevalent.

It is not yet clear why the dementia risk has dropped but the Cambridge University researchers think it may be partly due to better treatment for heart disease – including improved uptake of drugs for high blood pressure – which could protect against dementia.

It could also be down to improvements in education over the last century.

Children who stay at school for longer are less likely to get dementia later in life.

But the researchers warned that dementia – including Alzheimer’s disease – remains a huge burden on the NHS and society, which will only increase in the coming years.

The study also found that the percentage of care home residents with dementia had increased from 56 per cent to 70 per cent, with fewer residents in better health.

This places a considerable burden on staff and means patients may be at risk receiving of poor care.The researchers said the development could be because the elderly and frail are more likely to receive support at home from carers, using residential homes only as a last resort when they are too ill to care for themselves.

The study, published in the Lancet, followed 8,000 randomly selected over-65s between 2008 and 2011, recording how many participants had dementia.

They compared the findings with the results of another group of 7,000 adults who had been followed between 1989 and 1994.

The proportion diagnosed with dementia dropped from 8.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent over the 20-year period, a fall of 24 per cent.

A study of almost 15,000 people revealed that within the general population there are now 200,000 fewer cases than predicted two decades ago. Image shows a CT scan of a brain with Alzheimer's disease

Professor Anthony Arthur, of the University of East Anglia said: ‘What we are not 
saying is that the numbers of adults with dementia is falling.

But individually someone aged 65 has a lower risk than they did 20 years ago.

‘Obviously as the population ages there will be more people in the 65-and-over category.
‘We think that risk factors associated with heart disease have declined dramatically.’

Researchers think that one cause may 
be the increasing use of drugs for high blood pressure such as beta 
blockers, which are thought to have a protective effect because they 
help maintain a steady flow of blood to the brain.

Another cause may be a fall in the numbers of smokers. Tobacco is known to increase the risk of getting the disease.

Dementia prevalence is higher amongst women than men over 65 with 7.7 per cent thought to have dementia, compared to 4.9 per cent of men

An Alzheimer’s Society spokesman 
said: ‘This interesting study could indicate that better heart health 
and education are combining to play a role in reducing dementia 
prevalence.

‘While this is good news, this is one study which needs careful examination and may not indicate a continuing trend.

‘Dementia remains the biggest health and social care challenge facing the UK.’

Dr Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of
 the Lancet said, ‘A reduction in prevalence of dementia in the older 
population is an important and welcome finding.

‘But it is not a signal for government to deprioritise investment in dementia care and research.

‘Dementia remains a substantial challenge for those affected, their families, the NHS, and the Treasury.’
