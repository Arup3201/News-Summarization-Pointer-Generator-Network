If you thought the Mocha Frappuccino was the most creative item Starbucks had to offer, then think again.

A group of Starbucks baristas in Santa Ana, California, have come up with a decadent new array of beverages, all created using in-store ingredients.

The challenge, set by Foodbeast, saw competitors blend frappucinos with baked goods, fresh fruit and of course plenty of coffee.

LA Smog: Inspired by the Los Angeles sky, this drink contains green tea frappuccino, a pump of mocha, java chips, espresso, Italian drizzle and espresso whip

Half baked: The Blueberry Breakfast Shake and the Strawberry Shortbread Crumble feature muffins and cookies

One, named LA Smog, combines a green tea Frappuccino with a pump of mocha, java chips, espresso, Italian drizzle and espresso whip to create a murky visual effect.

And for those who like to drink their breakfast, the Blueberry Breakfast Shake is topped with a muffin crumble and fresh blueberries.

It is a creation tasters were particularly impressed by: 'It tastes as amazing as it sounds and actually didn’t feel too heavy.’

Shake it up: The Mexican Flag Frap and Apple Pie Frap round out the list of decadent drinks

Unfortunately we’re unlikely to see the Blueberry Breakfast Shake on official Starbucks menus anytime soon - Foodbeast notes that baristas aren't actually permitted to blend baked goods.

Another forbidden concoction is the Strawberry Shortbread Crumble, which adds shortbread cookies to the mix – and it’s not the only play on a classic dessert.

The strawberry, chocolate and vanilla Neapolitan Frap references 1980s ice cream tubs, while the Orange County Dream gets its creamsicle flavor from the combination of a Vanilla Bean Frappuccino and a Valencia Orange Refresher.

The sites notes that there's no guarantee your local Starbucks will attempt to make any of these decadent drinks - though if you get lucky, they will likely cost between $4.25 and $6.75.

In May, a Dallas, Texas, man named Andrew Chifari claimed to have created the world's most expensive Starbucks drink, which he called the Sexagintuple Vanilla Bean Mocha Frappuccino. It included 60 shots and was valued at $54.75.
