Shakespeare is renowned for his enormous vocabulary as well as his introduction of new words to the English language - but can any modern-day writers compete with his literary skills?

A New York data scientist not only proved that there are indeed contemporary lyricists that can give the playwright a run for his money, he has also discovered that they come from an unexpected source - hip hop.

By comparing the works of Shakespeare with 85 different hip-hop artists, he found 37-year-old Californian rapper Aesop Rock - who used 7,392 unique words in his first 35,000 lyrics - has a wider vocabulary than the 16th century poet.

Earlier this week, New York-based data scientist Matt Daniels analysed the first 35,000 lyrics of 85 hip-hop and rap artists and compared the number of unique words to those used in the first 35,000 words of Shakespeare's plays and Herman Melville's Moby Dick. In top spot was Aesop Rock who used 7,392 unique words, highlighted, while DMX sat at the opposite end of the scale with 3,214 unique words

1. Aseop Rock: 7,392 unique words

2. GZA: 6,426 unique words

3. Kool Keith: 6,238 unique words

4. Herman Melville: 6,022 unique words

5. Canibus: 5,991 unique words

6. CunninLynguists: 5,971 unique words

7. RZA: 5,905 unique words

8. Wu-Tang Clan: 5,985 unique words

9. Roots: 5,803 unique words

10. Ghostface Killah: 5,774 unique words

11. Killah Priest: 5,737 unique words

12. Blackalicious: 5,480 unique words

13. Kool G Rap: 5,394 unique words

13. Redman: 5,331 unique words

14: E-40: 5,207 unique words

15. MF Doom: 5,204 unique words

16. Outkast: 5,212 unique words

17. Shakespeare: 5,170 unique words

18. Nas: 5,096 unique words

19. Beastie Boys: 5,090 unique words

20. Das EFX: 5,005 unique words

By comparison, Shakespeare used 5,170 unique words, putting his vocabulary alongside Beastie Boys and Outkast, while Moby Dick author Herman Melville scored 6,022, only beaten by Kool Keith, GZA and Aesop Rock.

‘Literary elites love to rep Shakespeare’s vocabulary: across his entire corpus, he uses 28,829 words, suggesting he knew over 100,000 words and arguably had the largest vocabulary, ever,' explained Matt Daniels from Undercurrent in New York.

‘I decided to compare this data point against the most famous artists in hip hop. I used each artist’s first 35,000 lyrics. That way, prolific artists, such as Jay-Z, could be compared to newer artists, such as Drake.

Daniels analysed the first 5,000 words for seven of Shakespeare's works including Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Macbeth, As You Like It, Winter's Tale, and Troilus and Cressida. While for Melville, he studied the first 35,000 words used in his 1851 novel Moby Dick.

All lyrics were taken from website Rap Genius, but Daniels only used lyrics current to 2012. As a result, he said this lack of recent data prevented him using a number of more recent artists such as Kid Cudi.

He also admitted a few other high-profile rappers didn’t have enough official material to be included, for example, Biggie and Kendrick Lamar.

According to Daniels, 35,000 lyrics is 
the equivalent of between three and five studios albums, but because not
 all artists have released that number of tracks, he included mixtapes.

He then used a methodology called 
token analysis, also known as lexical analysis which involves using a 
computer to turn words into tokens that can be analysed and counted. 

As
 Daniels explained, each word was counted once, so pimps, pimp, pimping,
 and pimpin are four unique words. To avoid issues with apostrophes, for
 example, pimpin’ versus pimpin, Daniels removed these from the dataset.

‘It still isn’t perfect. 
Hip hop is full of slang that is hard to transcribe, for example, shorty
 vs. shawty, featured vocalists, and repetitive choruses.’

But he adds it’s still interesting and reveals a wide range.

Aesop Rock was well-above every artist in the dataset, while the presence of Wu Tang Clan at number seven, excluding Herman Melville, was also significant.

This
 is because, as well as being in the top ten as a group, individual 
members also feature in the top 20 with GZA at number two, Ghostface 
Killah at nine and Raekwon and Method Man at 19 and 20 respectively.

Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Macbeth, As You Like It, Winter's Tale, and 
Troilus and Cressida. While for Herman Melville, pictured right, he 
studied the first 35,000 words used in his 1851 novel Moby Dick. 
Shakespeare used 5,170 unique words putting his vocabulary alongside 
Beastie Boys and Outkast, and Melville scored 6,022, only beaten by Kool 
Keith, GZA and Aesop Rock

In top spot on the chart was 37-year-old Californian rapper Aesop Rock, also known as Ian Matthias Bavits, pictured left, who used 7,392 unique words in his first 35,000 lyrics. While Earl Simmons, known as DMX, pictured right holding the award for Male Entertainer of the Year at the Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles, sat at the opposite end of the scale with 3,214 unique words

‘Perhaps their countless hours of studio time together exposed each rapper’s vocabulary to one another,’ explained Daniels.

To
 further understand each rapper's vocabulary in Wu-Tang's first five 
albums, Daniels selected a 3,500-word threshold to put each member was 
on an equal footing.

‘U-God
 and GZA clearly bolster the group’s average,’ said Daniel. 'Raekwon and
 Method Man’s contributions have a lower average compared to other 
members, but recognise that their data points would exceed most artists 
in hip hop.’

Wu-Tang Clan made the top ten, but individual members also made the top 20. GZA is at number two, Ghostface Killah is at nine and Raekwon and Method Man at 19 and 20. To further understand each rapper's vocabulary in Wu-Tang's first five albums, Daniels selected a 3,500-word threshold, pictured. 'U-God and GZA clearly bolster the group's average,' said Daniel. 'Raekwon and Method Man's contributions have a lower average, but their data points exceed most artists in hip hop'

Wu-Tang Clan perform at Pimlico Racetrack in Baltimore. From left to right, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God, and Inspectah Deck. To explain the group's large vocabulary, Daniels said: 'Perhaps their countless hours of studio time together exposed each rapper's vocabulary to one another'

Daniels also looked at where the 
rappers were from, to see if there was a vocabulary divide between 
southern, midwest, west and east coast states.

The south had the lowest average at 4,268, while the east-coast, including 50 Cent and Fat Joe, scored highest with 4,804.

Only
 four of the 17 southern-based artists in the dataset were above 
average, including Outkast, as Daniels explained: ‘At 15, Outkast’s deep
 vocabulary is definitely a function of their style: frequent use of 
portmanteau, such as ATLiens, Stankonia, southern drawl, including 
nahmsayin, ery’day, and made-up slang, for example, flawsky-wawsky.

'My guess is that this is a function of crunk music's call-and-response style, resulting in more repetition of words.’

Daniels also discovered some of the biggest names in hip hop scored below the average. These included 2Pac on 3,790 words, Snoop Dogg on 3,974, Kanye on 3,982 and Lil Wayne on 3,743, pictured. Popular artist Drake scored 3,522. While Jay Z scored marginally higher than Nelly with 4,506 compared to 4,413 respectively

Meanwhile, Daniels discovered some of the biggest names in hip hop scored poorly and well below the average.

These included 2Pac on 3,790 words, Snoop Dogg on 3,974 and Drake on 3,522. Jay Z scored marginally higher than Nelly with 4,506 compared to 4,413 respectively.

The highest scoring female was Lil Kim on 4,474 unique words, followed by Nicki Minaj on 4,162 and Missy Elliott with 3,874.
