Sergeant Woods, joined by an Army and Air Force crew, were on a resupply mission to a U.S. camp in Bu Prang, Vietnam aboard a C-123 Provider when the aircraft came under enemy fire on Oct. 24, 1964. The plane crashed and all seven men aboard, including Woods, perished.

While the remains of the other six men were recovered, remains of Sergeant Woods could not be found at the time.

In December 2009 and January 2010, a joint American and Vietnamese team excavated a site near where the plane has crashed to search for Woods' remains, according to the New York Times. While they found human remains, they could not conclusively identify them as belong to the missing soldier.

On Friday, Woods, along with his fellow crew members, were buried in a single coffin as part of group burial. The other soldiers are Air Force Capt. Valmore W. Bourque, Air Force 1st Lt. Robert G. Armstrong, Air Force Staff Sgt. Ernest J. Halvorson, Air Force Staff Sgt. Theodore B. Phillips, Air Force Airman 1st Class Eugene Richardson, Army Pfc. Charles P. Sparks.

'Therefore today, they were all buried in this one ceremony to include Wood,' Lt. Col. Melina Morgan, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Defense's POW/Missing Person's Office, told the newspaper.

Relatives of the men were joined by other soldiers at the funeral service. Woods' children, Steven R. Woods and Lisa Szymanski, accepted a folded American flag. Woods held a framed picture of his father during the service.

'I would like to say “thank you” today to those who have never forgotten, who remember the soldiers and what they do every day,' Szymanski said at the burial, reported the Leaf-Chronicle.  'I would like to thank the people who taught us what those initials mean – Prisoner of War and Missing in Action. We will never forget what you have done for all of us, and we appreciate it.'

Although Szymanski never met her father, she said that he instilled pride.

'His legacy lives on in the hearts of his children and his grandchildren,' she said. 'His legacy lives on in the aspirations of his great-grandchildren. And his legacy lives on in the hearts of all of you who have never forgotten and never will forget the sacrifice he made.'

The Arlington ceremony wasn't the only one that took place on Friday for Woods. His hometown of Clarksville, Tennessee held a memorial service, attended by two of his grandsons and their families.

'It was amazing,' Donnie Woods said. 'I didn’t think anyone would remember, but once I heard they were doing [the Clarksville ceremony], I knew I had to be there.'

More than 58,000 soldiers died in the Vietnam War. And 1,642 remain missing, according the the Department of Defense.
