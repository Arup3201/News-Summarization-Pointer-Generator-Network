Six of Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s senators are reportedly plotting to vote against him when it comes to the softening of Australia’s race hate laws.

The senators are in favour of a proposed bill, put forward by Family First senator Bob Day, that weakens the Racial Discrimination Act by removing the words ‘insult’ and ‘offend’ meaning no one can be prosecuted for insulting or offending someone over their race, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Mr Abbott backed down on plans to water down the Racial Discrimination Act in August last year after controversial changes to the act had been discussed for over six months.

He was ridiculed by the opposition, ethnic leaders, the public and his own party over his u-turn.

Mr Abbott first announced he wanted to reform section 18C of the act when journalist Andrew Bolt was found to have breached the act with a Herald Sun column. The political commentator fell foul to 18C for an opinion piece questioning the motives of lighter-skinned Aboriginal people.

The amendments would have scrapped a prohibition on offending, insulting or humiliating individuals based on race.

It’s now emerged that half a dozen of his senators still want the act reformed and are willing to cross the floor to make it happen.

The Sydney Morning Herald says West Australian senator Chris Back, Queensland Liberal National Party senator Ian Macdonald and South Australian senator Sean Edwards are all in favour of voting to soften the race hate laws.

Known supporters of Family First’s proposed bill also include Liberal senators Cory Bernardi, Dean Smith, Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm and senator Linda Reynolds

Attorney-General Brandis has previously said Australians have a 'right to be bigots' when defending his proposed changes to the law.

However, the repeal of 18C, which was an Abbott government election commitment, has been widely criticised as a watering down of protections against racism.

Section 18C of the act makes it unlawful to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin.

Queensland Liberal National Party senator Ian Macdonald also believes Australian's should be allowed to insult and offend people over their race, according to how he has indicted he will vote

Senator Linda Reynolds believes the law prevents 'free speech' rather than protects people 

More than 5500 submissions flooded into the Attorney-General's office following the release of draft laws in March 2014.

Only a handful were released publicly but the majority reportedly opposed the changes.

Last year, the PM admitted the proposed changes to section 18C of the act had 'complicated' relations with ethnic groups.

Coalition backbenchers joined the opposition, and Labor leader Bill Shorten says that's why the 'deeply unpopular' changes have been ditched.

'What is clear ... is that the Attorney-General has been rolled by his cabinet,' Mr Shorten told reporters.

The government had been humiliated and embarrassed by the proposal, he said.

'This has been a dreadful waste of national energy,' the opposition leader added.

The Australian Greens have also repeatedly questioned the motive behind the changes to the law.

South Australian senator Sean Edwards has also reportedly announced he's in favour of changes to the law
