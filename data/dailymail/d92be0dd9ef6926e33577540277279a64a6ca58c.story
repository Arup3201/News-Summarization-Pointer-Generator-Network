A farmer who was annoyed after Russians sold China expensive military equipment more than twenty years ago has spent his life savings building his own submarine.

Du Xiutang put 300,000 yuan (£32,310) towards the project and asked friends and family to donate anything they could. 

The 53-year-old, from Yulin, China, still needs 300,000 yuan to complete the submarine, which has already taken nearly seven months to build, People's Daily Online reported.

The self-taught former miner has finished building an escape pod and managed to install a power source.

He even invented a hydraulic drainage and dual propeller system, which has been patented nationally.

He is awaiting a periscope - but hopes he will be able to put the sub in the water this summer. 

Mr Du, who has had a life-long interest in mechanical design, said: 'When Russia sold China a retired submarine at a high price in 1992 I thought the Chinese people must make their own submarines.

'The most advanced submarines in the world cannot always be made by others. These thoughts motivated me all these years to succeed.' 

Some of the money has been provided by his son, who works in the welding factory where the submarine is stored.

Professional researchers and engineers are stunned that Mr Du  developed the submarine.

Here are its specifications: 

Mr Du added that he was determined to get more money and would not stop.

He said: 'In order to take this project further this is the only option. 

'I am looking for a business partner who has strong economic credentials and who has a sincere willingness to work in the defence industry.

'If we give up at this halfway point then all that hard work will have been for nothing. I am riding on the back of a tiger at this point. I just can’t get off.'
