Laura Trott has a pre-race obsession: Bruce Springsteen's No Surrender.

Team GB's 2012 Olympic gold medal whizz-kid listens to the song to rev herself up before each battle in the velodrome, but she might be unique in her track selection.

It seems most people prefer plugging themselves into Queen, Madonna, Lady Gaga or Prodigy while working out, according to a new study.

Some 57 per cent of 2,000 fitness enthusiasts surveyed claimed music significantly helped them train.

But while British silver-winning gymnast Louis Smith listens to reggae to get into his sporting zone, and American swimmers Michael
 Phelps and Ryan Lochte both opt for rapper Lil' Wayne, the general 
public are much more keen on pop and house music to get their muscles 
moving in the gym.

Some 29 
per cent of people surveyed by Tesco Phone Shop said they listen to pop 
music while working out, while 26 per cent prefer dance and house music 
and 35% choose rock.

A calm and collected three per cent 
listen to classical music while training, and five per cent opt for an 
R'n'B-flavoured sountrack. Three per cent who really like to feel the burn choose heavy metal.

Queen's
 1970s classic Don't Stop Me Now topped the individual song polls with 
15 per cent of the vote, followed by Survivor's Eye of The Tiger with 14
 per cent and Tina Turner's The Best with eight per cent.

Don't Stop Me Now also scored the most votes with women, while Eye Of The Tiger was most popular song with male voters.

Turner's song scored the most votes with the over-55s.

Over in Stratford, Team GB's Olympic athletes have 
revealed they are more likely to have a pre-match listen to the Chemical
 Brothers (Chris Hoy), 2Pac (Mo Farrah) and Phil Collins (Ben Ainslie).

Queen's Don't Stop Me Now is the most popular song to listen to while working out in the UK

Dr Costas Karageorghis, a reader in 
sport psychology and deputy head of the School of Sport and Education at
 Brunel University in London, has spent 20 years conducting scientific 
research into the effects of music on sport and exercise.

He
 said: 'Music and sport have much in common: both are culturally 
pervasive, both are about good rhythm and both touch us emotionally. 
Athletes routinely tap the power of music as part-and-parcel of their 
training.

'Our research has
 shown that during exercise well-selected music can reduce the 
perception of effor by as much as 12 per cent and enhances mood by 10 
per cent.

'As well as using
 stimulative music during training, many athletes are discovering the 
recuperative benefits of calming music following a tough workout.'

Former Aston Villa footballer Ian Taylor, who
 has designed a range of workout-friendly iT7 wireless headphones which 
use Bluetooth technology, said: 'This research backs up exactly how I 
used music when
training. It definitely helped my stamina, improved my concentration and
boosted my performance.'
