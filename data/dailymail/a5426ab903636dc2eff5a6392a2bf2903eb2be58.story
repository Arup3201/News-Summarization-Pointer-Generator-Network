These festive pictures show the country's only free-roaming herd of reindeer wandering across the snow-topped hills of the east Highlands.

Rather than calling Lapland their home, the 150-strong Cairngorm Reindeer Herd can be found in two locations in Scotland.

Around 50 animals can be found ranging the Cairngorm Mountains, such as these pictured, while the remainder stay the Glenlivet Estate - some 30 miles away.

Born free: The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd, pictured, is Britain's only free-roaming group of reindeer and can be found in the Highlands in Scotland

Numbers: There are 150 animals in the herd - some of which roam the Cairngorm mountains while the others stay in the Glenlivet Estate 30 miles away

Santa's little helper: The hard-working animals are all tame and regularly appear at festive gatherings throughout the winter months

The reindeer were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by a Swedish reindeer herder, Mikel Utsi.

He started with just a few reindeer, but the herd has grown over the years.

It is currently held at between 130 and 150 by controlled breeding, with most deer being born in the summer months.

An account of the introduction written by Mr Utsi is featured on the official website for the animals.

One-off: The reindeer, more commonly associated with Lapland, were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by Swedish reindeer herder Mikel Utsi

Running free: The herd - which have also featured in numerous films and television shows - is kept at around 150 by controlled breeding

Well looked after: The animals are monitored and cared for by staff at the Reindeer Centre in Glenmore, which was founded by the animal herder

In it, he says: 'Looking across Rothiemurchus Forest to the Cairngorms from the railway bridge at Aviemore on a cold morning in April 1947, I was instantly reminded of reindeer pastures in Lapland.

'In 1952, I brought some of my Swedish mountain reindeer to Scotland as an experiment, to show that they could live and breed in these surroundings.

'Official difficulties which had caused delay were overcome mainly through the interest shown by the Press and the influence of the Reindeer Council of the United Kingdom.'

The animals are tame and are often drafted in to pull sleighs during the months of November and December.

Meet and greet: Visitors to the centre can go on guided tours of the area and even meet some of the free-roaming animals

Explorer: This rather intrepid animal looks far more at home in the Scottish Highlands than Lapland

In the winter months, teams of reindeer are rounded up to visit Christmas parades around the country - hopefully getting everyone in the festive spirit.

The hard-working creatures also appear at certain promotional events and even work in film studios.

In winter, a daily visit to the herd departs from theÂ  Reindeer centre in Glenmore - with guides taking visitors to the animals.

At certain times of the year a small group are catered for at the centre in a paddock.

Working hard: The animals are often using in Christmas parades and can be found at Santa's grottos in the run up to Christmas
