This is the shocking moment a Philadelphia high school teacher was filmed lying unconscious in a hallway after allegedly being knocked out by a  student.

Pewu Johnson, 68, a substitute English teacher, reportedly reprimanded the teenager after he saw a girl sitting on his lap in an 'inappropriate' manner at Bartram High School.

Later that day, the student confronted Mr Johnson and told him, 'get the f*** out of my face', before throwing him to the ground, causing him to smack his head against the floor, school officials said.

Shocking: Teacher Pewu Johnson, 68,  is caught on video lying unconscious in a hallway at Bartram High School in southwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after being knocked out by a male student

Recovering: Mr Johnson (pictured), a substitute English teacher, reportedly reprimanded the teenager after he saw a girl sitting on his lap in an 'inappropriate' manner. Later that day, the student confronted him

Video footage, filmed on another student's camera and later shared on social media, shows the teacher lying motionless in the hallway while his alleged attacker stands over his body.

'He grabbed me, then lifted me up, then dropped me on my back, on the floor. I became unconscious. I wasn't hearing anything. I was out.' Mr Johnson told The Philadelphia Inquirer.  

Following the apparent assault, Mr Johnson was rushed to hospital, where he was examined and treated for concussion. He was released several hours later, NBC Philadelphia reported.

But despite his release, the victim, a Liberian immigrant with deep roots in Philadelphia, still suffers from intense neck pain and is not sure when he will be fit enough to return to work.

Meanwhile, the unidentified student has been suspended from the school in south-west Philadelphia. He is expected to be charged with a criminal offense in coming days.

Speaking of the assault on Thursday afternoon, Philadelphia School District spokesman Fernando Gallard said it was 'the result of an individual making a dramatically poor choice'.

Knocked out: Following the apparent assault, Mr Johnson was rushed to hospital, where he was examined and treated for concussion. He was released several hours later, but still suffers from intense neck pain

He added: 'The School District does not tolerate this type of behavior and is working with Bartram High School and Philadelphia Police to make sure that the student is discipline and also charged.'

Alarmingly, Thursday's attack was the third assault on a teacher at the school in less than a month.

On October 21, a teacher suffered a badly injured back after being shoved to the floor twice by a ninth-grade student who  attempted to snatch their laptop.

And on October 9, a 12th grade student punched a teacher in the face in a bid to witness a fight that had erupted outside the classroom.
