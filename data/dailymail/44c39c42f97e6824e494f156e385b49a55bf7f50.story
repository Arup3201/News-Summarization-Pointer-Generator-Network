There was agony for England's netball team as they lost by a single point to Australia after Caitlin Bassett made it 49-48 with just seconds left on the clock at the SECC.

World champions Australia now top Pool B, with England likely to play reigning Commonwealth champions New Zealand if they finish runner-up in the group.

It all looked so promising for England early on, after they lead 16-10 in the opening quarter.

Australia fought back to trail by a point at half-time with the score at 27-26 in England's favour, but they doubled that lead by the end of the third period.

In a nail-biting final quarter - which saw Australia adopt an increasingly robust approach - the lead changed hands a number of times, and it was left to Bassett to break English hearts with a dramatic late finish to seal Australia's win.

England shooter Joanne Harten burst into tears at the final whistle, having missed a chance just seconds before Bassett won the game for Australia.

Afterwards, Serena Guthrie told BBC Sport she believes Australia were 'over the top' with their physical play during their win.

'It felt a bit over the top today, but that's the game,' said Guthrie. 'We will see what they can bring in terms of skill, because the physicality is certainly there. I know Sharni well. I came up with her through the under-21s.

'She's a physical player and put on there for a reason. I don't think it got to us in the way they wanted it to. We held strong as a team. We deserved to win and that Aussie team didn't.'

England face South Africa in their next match on Sunday.
