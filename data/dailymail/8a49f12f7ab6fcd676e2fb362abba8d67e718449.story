A British jihadist who has lost two of his brothers in Syria has said he wants to stay and fight until he is also killed.

Amer Deghayes, 20, from Brighton, travelled to fight for al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affliated group, against the Bashar al-Assad regime in October 2013.

His younger brothers, Jaffar, 17, and Abdullah, 18, joined him in Syria but both have been killed in the conflict.

Family: Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) have both been killed 

Amer said their deaths had made him more determined to carry on fighting until he is killed, revealing that he has no desire to return to the UK.

'I have promised Allah that I will stay on the way of jihad until I get killed,' he told ITV News.

He describes martyrdom as the 'greatest success a person can attain', adding: 'It [his brothers' deaths] makes me more determined to get what they got.' 

Jaffar, 17, is believed to have died last weekend trying to overthrow dictator Assad's government.

His brother, Abdullah, 18, died in Latakia province in April after leaving the UK in January to reportedly take up arms with Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda-affiliated group.

Asked how his father reacted to news that he had lost another son, Amer replied: 'I expect that he accepts Allah's will.'

Abubaker Deghayes has urged the Government to rethink its approach to fighters wanting to return to the UK to encourage his son to come home.

But Amer, a former finance student, said he is not considering leaving Syria so 'does not pay much attention' to whether he would be allowed to come back to the UK.

In a film shot by Vice News this year, Amer  said: ‘My work here is not done. I came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice, and we still haven't reached the goal yet.’

He added: ‘I'm in the Syrian civil war because I believe it's my duty to fight here ...The Muslim nation is like one body. If one part complains, the other parts react, so I don't see it as a Syrian conflict. I see it as an Islamic conflict.’ 

The Deghayes' parents had insisted their boys are not terrorists, and simply went to Syria to protect the weak

However, he says a change in the law would help the fight against Assad as it would open 'the gates of support' and allow 'people that are thinking twice about coming here' to come and 'do their duty'

He said he did not think returning fighters would pose a threat to the UK.

The Deghayes brothers are the nephew of Omar Deghayes, who was held by the U.S. as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo Bay detention camp from 2002 to 2007 after he was arrested in Pakistan.

Counter-terrorism investigators have expressed concern about aspiring British jihadis travelling to Syria and becoming radicalised.

It emerged this month that a fourth man from Portsmouth, Hampshire - Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 19 - died fighting in Kobani.

Three others from the same city - Iftekar Jaman, 23, Mamunur Roshid, 24, and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in October last year.

In January alone, 16 people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences related to Syria compared with 24 arrests in the whole of last year.

Others who have died include one man suspected of carrying out a suicide attack. Abdul Waheed Majeed is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February.

The 41-year-old married father-of-three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria.
