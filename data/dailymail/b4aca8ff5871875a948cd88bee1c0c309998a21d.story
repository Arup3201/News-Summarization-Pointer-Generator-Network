Gordon Ramsay has revealed that his wife Tana ordered him to lose weight – because he was so chubby he could not see the bottom half of his body.

The 6ft 2in chef told how he embarked on a year-long fitness regime and slimmed down from a peak of 16st to 14 after Mrs Ramsay made him stand on the scales.

The 47-year-old told America’s Entertainment Tonight talk show: ‘Tana advised me I was putting on weight and she wanted me to get out of bed every morning and stand up and be able to look at my meat and two veg.

‘I’ve now got my six-pack back. It’s gone from two to four to six. She put me on a strict diet. Every day she made me stand on those scales.

‘She closed our kitchen down and turned it into a utility room. That’s like your wife driving your car every day and burning the clutch. 

'The fridge was empty then. Now the fridge is full of coconut water.’

Gordon looked noticeably slimmer when spotted dining out with wife Tana in Los Angeles last week

The Ramsays, who are best friends with Victoria and David Beckham and have been spotted twice in the past week dining out in Los Angeles, now follow a low-fat diet at home, favouring protein-rich dishes such as poached fish and grilled chicken.

Ramsay has also been working out with personal trainers in London and Los Angeles and recently competed in a triathlon and Iron Man contest.

Mrs Ramsay, who is due to appear on his US MasterChef programme, joked: ‘I gently mentioned that maybe he was getting a little bit rounded. I didn’t put him on a diet.’

She also said her notoriously foul-mouthed husband of 18 years is a ‘pushover’ with their four children especially with daughters Megan, 14, and Matilda, 12, known as Tilly.

She said: ‘Anything I say isn’t suitable, like high heels, wedges, they ask Gordon and he always says yes.’

Tilly, 12, is set to follow in her father’s footsteps by fronting her own cookery show on children’s channel CBBC. ‘Tilly’s a very good cook,’ said Ramsay.
