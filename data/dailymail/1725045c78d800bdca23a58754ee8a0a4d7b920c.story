She’s 33 weeks pregnant with her second baby but that hasn’t stopped this mum from pumping iron.

Brittany Hore, 22, is determined to keep fit while pregnant and has been working out at home while her fitness fanatic partner Freddy Arias and their one-year-old son Orlando keep a watchful eye.

The qualified personal trainer, from Currans Hill, south west Sydney, does weights three times a week as part of a structured programme which she hasn’t stopped because of her growing bump. 

Brittany Hore is 33 weeks pregnant and still loves doing weights to keep fight 

She does three 30-40 minute workouts every week to keep strong and says it isn't about being skinny

During her 30-40 minute workouts, Brittany does a variety of exercises including barbell curls, tricep dips and squats. 

At 33 weeks, babies weigh a little over 4 pounds and are about the size of a pineapple.

Brittany previously worked out throughout her pregnancy with her first son Orlando and told Daily Mail Australia that people who criticise her need to educate themselves first.

'People definitely have their opinions, they think it's wrong for you to exercise because it looks like it can harm the baby but it's about doing the research,' she said.

'They don’t have the knowledge to know it's good for you. For those people that do judge, you should go and research and look into it,' she added.

Brittany said if she feels sick one day then she won't train and she makes sure she doesn't push herself too hard

However, Brittany stressed that she has been exercising since the age of 16 and was doing weights before she was pregnant, while it's not advised for someone who has not lifted weights before to start when they are pregnant.

The former body sculptor has halved the weights she is using and explained: 'I was doing weight training before... there’s no harm to the baby as long as its not strenuous on the body.

'It’s more about watching your breathing and making sure you are not over exerting your body and are keeping a reasonable heart rate.' 

Brittany said if she feels sick one day then she won't train. For her it is not about being skinny but about feeling healthy.

'You shouldn't worry about putting on weight. It's about embracing the changes your body goes through and what you feel is good,' she reasoned.

Personal trainer Cassie White told Daily Mail Australia that while exercise in pregnancy can be a controversial issue it always comes down to the individual.

'It really depends on the woman and her previous experience with weights training. It's not recommended that a woman begin lifting heavy weights during pregnancy if she's completely new to it,' Cassie said.

However, she explained: 'If she’s been training for a long period of time, is strong and confident, knows good technique, eats well and gets plenty of sleep, lifting weights is generally fine. It’s really about context and the individual.'

Brittany has qualifications in fitness and has been working out for years 

She is now a stay at home mum with her one-year-old son Orlando 

Brittany said she does 30-40 minute workouts each time and that it is very Important to take 1-2 minute breaks between sets.

Here is her 3 Day Split Program:

Monday: Lateral pull down (3 sets), Seated row (3 sets), Barbell curls (3 sets), Calf Raises (3 sets)

Wednesday: Upright row (3 sets), Lateral raises (3 sets), Tricep dips (3 sets), Tricep kick backs (3sets)

Friday: Barbell squats (3sets),Walking lunges (3sets), Leg extension (3sets), Calf raises (3sets)

'Exercise is great during pregnancy – it helps with the birth and makes it easier for mum to get back into shape afterwards. The psychological benefits are really high, too. It just needs to be safe and progressed,' Cassie added.

'When women are pregnant a hormone called relaxin is released, which relaxes off the joints. During the late stage of pregnancy women are more at risk of muscular skeletal injury, especially around the sacroiliac joint, which is in the pelvis. So they need to be careful of dynamic movements that put pressure on it.

'At 33 weeks it’s not about heavy loads, it’s about keeping active and feeling good about herself. 

'Women should generally avoid doing exercises on their backs, be aware of blood pressure changes and single-leg work is generally too aggressive on the sacroiliac joint. But everyone is different when it comes to how much exercise they can handle and women just need to monitor themselves.'
