Police have asked villagers armed with a speed gun to stop clocking drivers breaking the law - because they can't cope with the paperwork. 

Residents in Ticknall, Derbyshire, were given the gun by officers to catch speeding motorists who break the 30mph limit through their village. 

So far the volunteers have carried out 10 speeding operations on the A514 main road through the village clocking a total of around 200 motorists.

But now police have told the group its operations are netting so many motorists they can't cope - so they'll have to stop clocking speeding drivers.

They have announced a new crackdown in the area as part of a new road safety scheme  - and told them they can stand down.

Drivers caught by the speed gun are sent warning letters from force saying they have breached the limit and if they do it again they risk prosecution. They are allowed 6mph leeway over the limit.

Volunteer Kevin Harris said: 'We are getting so many cars speeding that the police said they couldn't cope.

'But we will keep doing the speed watches because if we don't do something someone will be killed. 

'The police are doing what they can with the resources they have.'

Police say the new crackdown by the Derbyshire Road Safety Partnership will tackle speeding on problem roads in the county.

A Derbyshire Police spokesman said: 'Community speedwatch events are an extremely valuable resource of information for us, as they help to illustrate the volume of speeding in certain areas.

'This allows us to focus our efforts on areas that we know are a problem or could become one.

The A514 through Ticknall has been identified as one of 100 roads across the county that we will be focusing on over the coming year, and that is partly down to the work of local residents carrying out the speed watches.

'However, the watches do result in increased workload for police staff, as every driver seen speeding receives a letter and this has to be processed. 

'That is why we ask residents to be reasonable with the frequency and length of time spent recording details.'
