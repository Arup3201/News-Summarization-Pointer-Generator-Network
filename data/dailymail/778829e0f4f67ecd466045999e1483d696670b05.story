A prominent Japanese politician has raised hackles as Barack Obama visits Tokyo by claiming it's an 'open secret' that he and the first lady are headed for divorce, and that the president has been using Secret Service agents to cover for him as he pursues extramarital affairs.

Kazuyuki Hamada, who sits in the upper house of Japan's parliament, earned his PhD a half-mile from the White House at George Washington University, and emerged as a shrill commentator on America's economy and foreign policy.

In 2009 he also joined the ranks of the so-called 'birthers,' arguing in a book titled 'Who is Obama?' that the president likely wasn't born in the United States.

Boys' night out: President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shared expensive sushi on Wednesday in Tokyo, with their wives nowhere to be seen. Mrs. Obama stayed home, angering some outspoken Japanese politicians who saw her China visit in March as a slap

Kazuyuki Hamada (L) is a member of the upper house of Japan's parliament, called the National Diet. He claims the Obamas are headed for divorce over the president's cheating and the first lady's wild travel spending – especially her recent trip to China (R), which some in Japan saw as a slight

Uh-O: President Obama greeted U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy with extra warmth upon his arrival in Tokyo. His four-nation trip comes at a time of rising tensions and mounting distrust

But it's his more recent writing that's capturing the attention of the international press this week.

Hamada complained April 5 on his official blog about Obama's decision to visit Tokyo without first lady Michelle Obama in tow. 'His approval numbers are dragging down 
near 30 per cent,' Hamada wrote, according to an English translation.

BIRTHER: Kazayuki Hamada's 2009 book 'Who is Obama?' sided with so-called 'birthers,' arguing that it was likely the President of the United States was born abroad and was ineligible to hold the White House

'The 
president has been criticized for having no visions or leadership to 
solve domestic and diplomatic problems, some even ridiculing him as the 
worst president of the postwar era.'

'The biggest reason – of many – for the collapse of his reputation is his failed relationship with his wife,' Hamada claimed

'It is an open secret that the pair are already negotiating their divorce, and that they are waiting for his term in office to be over, and then they'll separate.'

He had stiff words for the impact of the first lady's multimillion-dollar 'goodwill' trips to far-flung places on the taxpayers' dime.

The Japanese pol claimed that 'if you ask the president, he will tell you, "I can't show my face to the voters after how she's spent so much money".'

'On the other hand,' Hamada added, 'if you get his wife to talk, she'll tell you: "The president is a pathological philanderer. He uses the Secret Service for this, and has used them to hide evidence that he's a cheater".'

Some of Hamada's claims appear to closely mirror a January report from the National Enquirer.

The tabloid reported in January that the Obamas are sleeping in separate bedrooms and have determined that the president will return to Hawaii in January 2017, while Mrs. Obama and their daughters will remain in Washington, D.C.

Hamada's official parliamentary biography notes that after earning his Ph.D, he worked for the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, and then for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.

CRS briefs, prepared for members of Congress, often sort out technical details or split economic hairs on issues vital to American national security, defense and economic survival. MailOnline was unable to identify any briefs that bear his name.

It's difficult to look at the nearly 50 books Hamada has published, though, without sensing an anti-American streak.

Trouble in paradise? The National Enquirer first claimed that the first couple's marriage was on the rocks, a report that Kazuyuki Hamada seems to have absorbed and taken seriously

What trouble? The Obamas seemed to put any public relationship fears to rest with a smooch during Monday's White House Easter Egg Roll -- a photo that may not have made it to Japan

No men allowed: Mrs. Obama took her mother and daughters on a multimillion-dollar China trip last month, turning her absence this month in Japan into an insult in some corners

The 2009 'Who is Obama?' includes the claim that the president 'has 
done nothing for the American People,' according to a partial translation of the book's introduction obtained by MailOnline.

'This
 is the man who, during the [2008] campaign, took massive amounts of 
money from Wall Street,' he wrote, 'and has now proceeded to throw around the 
American people's tax dollars – a man with nothing more than a promise 
on his lips.'

Hamada's
 other works include a 2002 volume titled 'The Dark Corridor: An 
American underground conspiracy of the military-industrial complex.'

In 2006 he wrote 'The Next World Order: The Rise and Development of America.' The low-budget paperback's cover,
 reminiscent of campaign literature from the anti-Federal Reserve former
 GOP congressman Ron Paul, featured a smirking Obama and a gold coin.

Howard LaFranchi, a staff writer with the Christian Science Monitor, first hinted at Hamada's anti-Obama rant on Wednesday.

In most corners, he wrote, Mrs. Obama’s absence from Tokyo 'is a woeful sign of Japan’s retreat from the top tier of America’s allies.'

One Obama, no waiting: The U.S. first lady didn't make the trip to Tokyo, leaving an adoring throng with only her husband to gawk at

Many, LaFranchi noted, are speculating 'that Obama is suggesting his lack of connection with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by coming stag, or that Michelle is hinting at her disapproval of this or that Japanese policy or reality (perhaps whaling? or maybe the relative subjugation of Japanese women?) by staying home.'

But if the first lady tags along when President Obama visits China next year, Hamada and other prominent Japanese national figures will likely crank up the anti-Obama press mill again.

Keith Koffler, a veteran White House correspondent, noted on his White House Dossier blog that the first lady has the perfect political excuse for avoiding the long trip to Japan: a Democratic National Committee fundraiser on Thursday.

The last American first lady to stay home while her husband made a state visit to Japan was Betty Ford in November 1974. That trip, just months after President Richard Nixon's resignation, marked the first time a sitting U.S. president traveled there.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment, despite MailOnline calling it a 'softball' question.
