When Melanie Sykes was unveiled as the new face and incredibly toned body of the Ultimo Adore Moi range, the world was in awe of her killer abs.

And now, the TV presenter has revealed the secrets behind her incredible body to MailOnline.

The 43-year-old says her body comes with hard work and she does sit-up, crunches and Russian twists every single day.

Melanie Sykes has been unveiled as the new face and incredibly toned body of Ultimo's Adore Moi range and achieved her killer body through a rigorous exercise regime

The mother-of-two explains that she barely drinks any alcohol and has a 'low-ish' carbohydrate intake.

She also swears by Active Woman Refine - tablets that describe themselves as 'fat torching' capsules.

The tablets claim to be packed with essential fat-fighting nutrients like CLA- a natural omega acid that targets fat deposits for conversion into energy- as well as Yerba Mate, green tea extract and L-carnitine, which aim to reduce body fat while increasing muscle.

Melanie says she takes two tablets daily in conjunction with her fitness regime.

Her final golden rule is commitment.

The star has previously opened up about how she maintains her incredible figure, telling MailOnline: 'On a good week if I'm not working I
get in the gym between three and five times a week, an hour a time.

'I
started training about four years ago. I was approaching 40 and just 
thought it would be quite good to get fit... I was slim, but it wasn't 
about that, it was about getting a bit fitter.'

And Melanie has showcased her hard work in her first ever lingerie campaign for Ultimo.

She joins Michael Buble's pregnant wife Luisana Lopilato as a face of the underwear brand.

This is Melanie's first lingerie campaign - and, at the age of 43, she looks better than ever

The latest collection from Adore Moi by Ultimo a French boudoir feel, featuring embroidery, French lace and fine detailing.

Speaking
about the campaign, mother-of-two Melanie said: 'I actually can’t 
believe I have shot my first lingerie campaign in my forties, but I 
really do feel in good shape at the moment and thought "OK Mel, it’s now
or never!".

'Adore
Moi is a brand that celebrates women - no matter your age or size - and
I’m really excited to be fronting the new campaign.'

Michelle
Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, said: 'Melanie epitomises everything the 
Adore Moi woman wants to be – beautiful, elegant, successful and 
confident in her own skin. 

'We’re thrilled to have her on board. She looks absolutely incredible in the designs and is an inspiration to all women in their forties.'

feel. The range is incredibly luxurious, but really affordable at just

Sharon
Webb, Debenhams Head of Lingerie Buying and Design, added: 'We are 
delighted to have Melanie as the new face of Adore Moi, she is the 
perfect fit for Ultimo and as a supporter of natural beauty, we are 
thrilled to have such an inspirational image being portrayed to our 
customers.'

It's been a year of celebrations for Melanie, who tied the knot with her toyboy lover Jack Cockings, 27, earlier this summer.
