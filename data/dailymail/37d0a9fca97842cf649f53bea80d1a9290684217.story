An alleged bullying incident during which a 15-year-old boy was tied up with his hoodie over his face in Minnesota is being investigated by authorities after the boy’s parents used social media to draw attention to it.

Dave and Nicolette Rochefort say they were shocked when they found out what had happened to their son, especially as a teacher had been present.

They say the teacher made no effort to stop the bullies – two 18-year-olds and a 17-year-old - who also whipped their son with an electrical cord.

The incident happened at Osakis High School during an industrial technology class on Friday.

A photo showing the boy sitting on the floor with his hands tied behind his back and a hoodie tied tightly over his head was posted on Facebook by the boy's mother

A photo showing the boy sitting on the floor with his hands tied behind his back and a hoodie tied tightly over his head was posted on Snapchat another student. 

Nicolette Rochefort posted the photo of her son on Facebook on Friday.  

‘Police say there is no criminal activity here!,' she wrote.

'Apparently it's okay to tie children up in school. Please share and pass on I want all of mn to see this. Bullying policies are NOT working!’

The post has since received more than 40 comments and been shared more than 16,000 times.

Dave Rochefort likened the position his son was left in to images in the media of extremists.   

'My 15-year-old son was tied up with his hands behind his back, legs in front, and his hood pulled tightly over his head and tied around the neck,' he told Fox 9 News. 

'Just like you see the terrorist group ISIS do to the people they kill.'

The boy's mom Nicolette Rochefort, left, says police claims that her son chose to be involved are ludicrous. Teacher Kyle Kostrzewski, right, has been placed on administrative leave while the district investigates

The parents allege that the incident went on for 40 minutes and only ended when a fire alarm sounded in school. 

Their son - who hasn't been named - called home immediately after the incident and his father picked him up and they went to the police department.

After interviewing other students in the class, Police Chief Chad Gulbranson told Osakis Review that it appeared that the victim chose to be involved in the act.

‘As horrible as the picture looks, it was determined that there was nothing criminal involved,’ said Gulbranson.  

The Rocheforts say claims that their son was a willing participant are 'ludicrous.'

Dave Rochefort claims his son has been a repeated target of bullying at the hands of upperclassmen, and that teachers and administrators have consistently turned a blind eye.

'It's ridiculous, these boys are troublemakers and nobody does anything about them,' he said.

He says his son has been shaken up by what happened and they have decided to pull each of their four kids out of Osakis schools as a consequence.

The teacher of the class where the bullying incident allegedly occurred is Osakis City Council member Kyle Kostrzewski. He has been placed on administrative leave while the district investigates the incident.
