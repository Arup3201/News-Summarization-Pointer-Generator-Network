Conman: James Whitehouse, pictured, was jailed for two years in October after he defrauded £1,800 from his lovers

A conman used a dating website to trick women into thinking he was ‘the perfect man’ before stealing their identities to take out payday loans.

James Whitehouse, 30, left four women riddled with debt after charming them online.

He spent months gaining their trust and told them he loved them, but then used their personal details to take out loans from companies including Wonga and Payday UK.

When the women became suspicious, he would end the relationship and move on to someone else.

Whitehouse, who drove one of his victims to bankruptcy, was arrested in October 2012 after one woman reported him to police, but he went on to deceive two more.

The gambling addict pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud totalling around £1,800 in October this year, and was jailed for two years at Birmingham Crown Court.

But the scam artist’s dealings are still affecting his victims. Emma Warren, 34, from Shirley, West Midlands, faced threats that bailiffs would be knocking on her door when she refused to pay three of the loans Whitehouse had taken out.

The single mother of one was encouraged by friends to join the dating site Plentyoffish.com.‘His first messages were very normal and both being parents, we had a lot in common,’ she said.

The pair met in person six weeks later in December 2012. Miss Warren said: ‘He was just so easy to be with. He was a real charmer, always attentive and complimentary.’ After three weeks Whitehouse told her he loved her.

But when the couple booked a holiday, he asked for her bank details to transfer his share of the money. Weeks later, she was stunned to find it was overdrawn.

She noticed the money he had sent her was a loan from Payday UK and other loans had been taken out in her name. Whitehouse refused to answer her calls.

Miss Warren said: ‘I contacted the bank straight away...  but they didn’t stop £200 being taken by Payday UK. All together the loans initially came to about £700.

‘But when I contacted the companies and explained that I hadn’t taken out these loans, they said I still owed the money.’

Whitehouse also ‘borrowed’ £2,000 in cash from her grandmother, claiming he needed it to look after his seven-year-old daughter, but it was never paid back.

Miss Warren, who can no longer give her three-year-old daughter the Christmas she had planned, added: ‘The payday companies need to make their policies stricter so not just anyone can get a loan with your name and account number.’

When she met Whitehouse he was still conning Emma Taylor, 28, from Birmingham, who met him on the same website in September 2012.

Miss Taylor lent him £200 but he repaid her with money from payday loan firms TXT loans and Minicredit, taken out in her name.

Judge William Davis QC said the conman had ‘defrauded vulnerable women one after the other, purely to support [his] gambling habit’.
