Migrants flowing into Europe by boat from Africa this year are expected to exceed 100,000 by mid-August, officials have said.

Nearly 91,000 people have reached Italy 
by sea since the start of the year, already close to the record-high of 
92,000 arrivals in 2011.

It came as another 2,500 arrived in Italy in the last 24 hours after being rescued by the navy and coastguard while crossing the Mediterranean.

Desperate: More2,500 migrants have arrived in Italy in the last 24 hours after being rescued by the navy while crossing the Mediterranean from Africa

Influx: The migrants were rescued in the previous few days in the Strait of Sicily while trying to reach Italian coasts from Africa

Around 1,000 people were brought by the coastguard into the southern port of Reggio Calabria.

Another
 958 migrants arrived in the Sicilian town of Pozzallo on board a navy 
vessel, while over 500 people reached the city of Palermo.

Most of them are Egyptians, Pakistanis, Eritreans, Syrians and Somalis, the authorities said.

Italy's navy and coast guard have been 
patrolling the Mediterranean Sea since last October as part of an 
EU-funded search-and-rescue mission called 'Mare Nostrum' (Our Sea).

But overwhelmed by the numbers, the country is increasingly waiving European rules to fingerprint migrants, allowing them to move on.

Many are then heading to Britain via Calais, where the unprecedented influx is causing a tense summer as clashes break out among asylum-seekers in overcrowded camps.

Sudanese and Eritreans have battled in
 the heat in France's port city, with frustrations rising as the 
Africans jockey for space while trying to sneak into Britain - the dream
 destination some 30 kilometers (20 miles) away.

British police have been on site trying to make sure they don't cross over.

Their
 French counterparts fired tear gas on Tuesday to break up the latest 
battles that left dozens injured, one seriously, the Calais prefecture 
said.

Migrants fleeing 
poverty and war in Africa and the Middle East arrive in Calais with 
hopes of crossing the channel on a ferry or on trucks laden with cargo.

Their numbers in the city at the edge of the English Channel have swelled to up to 1,300, overwhelming the city, aid agencies and police.

'There are migrants who arrive each day and each day some who succeed in getting to Britain,' said Deputy Mayor Philippe Mignonet, in charge of security, earlier this week.

He refused to say how many migrants outsmart the scanners, CO2 detectors and other technology used on trucks and planted through the Channel Tunnel.

'Calais has been taken hostage,' Mignonet said, blaming in part a Franco-British cooperation accord that he says puts the brunt of the burden on Calais.

Britain is seen by many migrants as Europe's Shangri-La, with a more humane treatment of migrants than continental neighbors like France, where there are only 22,000 living units for some 60,000 asylum seekers.

Clashes among migrants are a new phenomenon.

'There are lots of people, so there is lots more tension,' said Noemie Bourdet of aid group Secours Catholique in Calais.
