Experts have been left scratching their heads after the remains of large bird leg were discovered in an abandoned airfield in northern Scotland.

Nearly three feet long and with three sharp claws the size of a man's hand, the leg was found by a dog walker near Tealing, six miles north of Dundee.

Experts believe the remains may belong to a rhea, a flightless bird native to South America, but there are no known keepers in the area.

As yet, no one has been able to come up with an explanation for the bizarre find.

Sean Donaldson, who lives in a nearby cottage, said he made the discovery while walking his two-year-old black Labrador Oscar.

He said: 'We were down at the Tealing Airfield firing range just beside my house when he started jumping around and going nuts.

'I went to see what he'd found and he was standing over this huge leg, surrounded by lots of scattered feathers.

'The leg was almost three feet long and the claws are the size of my hand.

'The feathers were large and white with bits of black through them.

'I picked the leg up with a bag and took it home.'

Mr Donaldson, 39, a janitor at Dundee University, said he believes the mystery bird was killed on the spot by a bigger animal.

He said: 'I'm baffled by what this 
bird was.

'Some people have speculated it might have been an ostrich but 
it doesn't look exactly like an ostrich to me.

'And even if that's what it was, what was it doing running about an abandoned airfield?

'I can think of no logical explanation.

'The bird has clearly been killed here, by what I don't know. It looks like it's been moved around by whatever was eating it.

'But it was still fresh, and it stank a bit.'

Pictures of the bird's remains were sent to experts at the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Scottish
SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: 'We understand a large bird 
leg has been found in the Angus area and, having looked at a photograph,
we think it may have belonged to a rhea, a flightless bird native to 
South America.

'However, in order to confirm this, the remains would have to be taken to a museum for identification.

'It is likely this bird has been eaten by another animal but, as we are not aware of anyone in the area who keeps rheas, it is unclear how it came to be there.'

The rhea is normally a native bird of South America but the leg was discovered in an abandoned airfield in Tealing six miles north of Dundee
