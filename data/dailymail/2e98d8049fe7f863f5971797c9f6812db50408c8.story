These pictures show the giant hostel for refugees set up by the mayor of Calais to keep them safe from the elements as they wait to cross the channel to Britain.

The building in the port city has been converted from a former dockers' social club, and has space for 120 asylum seekers, mostly from Africa and the Middle East.

The refugees must sleep on mattresses on the floor, packed so closely together that it is almost impossible to walk between them.

Camp: This is the £70,000 winter shelter for refugees in Calais hoping to travel to Britain

Shelter: The refugees, mostly from Africa and the Middle East, are given sleeping bags to keep them warm

Converted: The building used to be a social club for dockers before being reopened as a refuge

The £70,000 winter refuge provides migrants with running water, heating and a sanitary block.

The town's mayor Natacha Bouchart opened the shelter last week after saying the number of people crossing the Channel had become 'untenable'.

They have also been provided with sleeping bags to help them fend off the cold winter weather.

Signs on the wall ban residents from drinking, smoking and fighting - suggesting that authorities are worried about the possibility of tempers boiling over as the migrants wait to enter the UK.

Warning: Signs at the shelter instruct residents not to drink, smoke or fight on the premises

Instructions: The shelter will provide a home for 120 refugees when temperatures drop below freezing

The
camp - situated in the centre of Calais - is similar in concept to the 
infamous Sangatte asylum centre, which attracted thousands of UK-bound 
migrants before it was closed by the 
French authorities in 2002. 

It opened its doors early last Thursday to a queue of more than 100 Syrians, Eritreans and Afghans.

The
migrants had been forced to beg for shelter due to stormy winds which 
had blown away their makeshift tents pitched within walking distance of 
the Channel ferry terminal.

Billed as a ‘humanitarian gesture’, the camp will remain open to migrants from 6.30pm to 9am when temperatures fall below freezing during the day and minus 5 at night .

Controversy: The shelter was opened because Calais is apparently struggling to cope with the influx of migrants

Halfway house: Many of the migrants staying at the shelter are expected to claim asylum in Britain

However, its opening has sparked anger among a group of residents calling itself ‘Save Calais’.

The
outraged locals plan a sit-in demonstration in front of the Town Hall 
to protest at the port falling prey to ‘massive immigration’. 

Last week, it emerged that Calais's council has been forced to employ a security firm to patrol the seafront to prevent desperate migrants from breaking into beach huts.

The immigrants were also sleeping rough on sand dunes and inhabiting the town's parks.

Speaking last week to justify the new winter refuge, Ms Bouchart said there were ‘between 10 and 15’ illegal squats in the town which are now subject to legal moves to evict migrants.

The largest squat - situated at Boulevard Victor Hugo - belongs to an 80-year-old woman.

It was occupied by the British anarchist group No Borders and is currently home to up to 90 migrants.

Sub Prefect of Calais Alain Gerard said that all evictions will be handled with ‘the maximum of humanity and respect’.
