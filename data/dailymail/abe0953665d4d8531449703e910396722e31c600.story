Billionaire playboy Stewart Rahr has lived up to his reputation after releasing a sex tape of himself engaging in an orgy with three young women in the back of a limousine.

The self-titled 'King Of All Fun' allegedly sent the tape to several of his New York contacts. It came one month after it emerged that he reached a $250million divorce settlement with ex-wife Carol.

The 43-year marriage began before the pharmaceutical mogul made his fortune, so many assumed the riches would be split evenly in the absence of any prenuptial agreement.

In the video, the 67-year-old can be heard from behind the camera urging the three pretty brunettes to perform sex acts on each other, the New York Post reports.

The song 'I Don’t Care, I Love It' 
can be heard in the background. He emailed the video around with the 
message: 'What a trip, what a crew!'

Rahr’s lawyer Ben Brafman told the Post when asked about the video: 'However
inappropriate or offensive the footage might appear to some, all the 
women are consenting adults who were engaged in friendly, voluntary and 
lawful behavior.'

The video is thought to have been posted in the South Of France. 

Rahr sold his pharmaceutical company Kinray for $1.3 billion in 2010 and did not have any money when he met his wife Carol.

In that time, he has built 
friendships with power brokers including Bill Clinton, Michael Milken, 
Alicia Keys, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Lionel Richie and Andrea 
Bocelli through his philanthropic work.

'Stewart always said he’d never get divorced because it would be too expensive,' a source told the New York Post last month. 'They met when he didn’t have two cents to rub together. She could be entitled to half his $1.6billion fortune.'

The couple’s considerable real estate  assets will be split. According to the Post, Rahr will retain ownership of their Hampton’s estate, for which he paid a record breaking $45 million in 2005.

Carol will keep their New York City pad, a $30 million unit in the Trump Park Avenue.

Rahr, 67, was served with divorce 
papers in late 2012 in front of the couples’ own home. Carol Rahr's 
decision to launch divorce proceedings against her husband, follows 
reports that the couple have been living increasingly separate lives in 
recent years.

His: In 2005, Rahr forked over the highest sum ever paid for a residence in New York for his 18,000 square foot Hampton's mansion. He kept the house in the divorce

Speculation
over how tempestuous the proceedings would become grew after it was 
reported that Carol hired Robert Stephen Cohen, a divorce attorney 
dubbed the 'pit bull’ who has previously represented the likes of 
Christie Brinkley, Ellen Barkin, and Uma Thurman, and is famous for 
playing tough.

The Rahr's divorce settlement ranks among the highest of all time, but some even rank above it:

Those rumors were further fueled when 
Rahr, in turn, hired attorneys Ben Brafman and David Aronson, whose firm
Aronson, Mayefsky & Sloan represented Katie Holmes in her 
high-profile divorce from Tom Cruise.

'Mr
Rahr intends to act honorably and fairly,’ Brafman said when the 
divorce was first reported. ‘He is hopeful and confident that the 
parties will come to an amicable agreement and that despite ending their
marriage, will remain friends in the years ahead.'

‘I just have so few sunrises left and I want to be happy,’ Rahr explained to Forbes
after the divorce was announced last year. He said he believes 
marriages should have clauses allowing them to be annulled mutually once
children reach adulthood.

But
if years of reports of Rahr throwing tantrums, threatening violence, 
and trying to buy his way into the ‘King Of All Fun’ title are to be 
believed, the marriage may not have ended as mutually as Rahr describes.

According to the New York Post, one 
incident allegedly stemmed from a dispute between him and professional 
gambler RJ Cipriani. Rahr allegedly pulled a gun on an elevator operator
at Trump Tower in New York after an altercation with the man.

When police arrived, Rahr was found to have a gun, which was confiscated by officers. He claimed it wasn't loaded.

And
in December, Rahr was banned from top New York restaurant Nobu after 
the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he 
didn't get his favorite table.

Rahr reportedly sent an email complaint to Nobu owner Drew Nieporent.

He admits having a disagreement with a female manager but denied threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call.

No bull: Last year, the testy Rahr was accused of threatening to kill the manager of Nobu restaurant in New York and then emailing his celebrity friends about the experience

It was reported that after the face-to-face confrontation with the manager, which occurred on the night of Carol’s birthday party, he sent a caps-locked tirade to Nieporent and CC'ed a group of his famous friends including Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix.

It is unknown what, if any response, Rahr got from his celebrity crowd sourcing but his misbehavior did reportedly get him banned from all 25 international Nobu locations.

Sweetheart: Though he's called Stewie Rah-Rah for his partying, he's also called generous for his giving and his philanthropy has even won him connections with the royal family

Philanthropist: Rahr, here with Jessica Simpson at an Operation Smile event, has even hosted charity events with guests like Bill Clinton, Ed Koch, and Mark Wahlberg

But Rahr appears to have a softer side, as well.

His philanthropic activities, including large sum donations to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, have helped him to forge friendships with powerful figures such as Bill Clinton and Michael Milken. Singers Alicia Keys and Andrea Bocelli performed at his annual charity dinner.

Rahr made his fortune selling wholesale pharmaceuticals. He sold the company he started and still wholly owned, Kinray Pharmaceuticals, for a reported $1.3 billion in 2010.
