Manchester City have unveiled the kit that Manuel Pellegrini's side will wear on the road as they pursue back-to-back Premier League titles.

The champions have revealed their new dark blue Nike away kit with just 16 days to go until they kick off their season at Wembley in the Community Shield against Arsenal.

The shirt gradually gets lighter as it reaches the shorts - but doesn't quite come close to City's sky blue home kit. Yellow details stand out across the shirt - including a 'We are City' message on the inside collar.

Fans will be pleased to see the return of the dark blue and yellow colours - intended as a nod towards the 2-2 Second Division Play-Off final draw in 1999 that saw City promoted on penalties.

The new kit is available for pre order now and hits the shops on July 29.

And as if Sergio Aguero and co needed an edge to beat their rivals, the kit even includes socks with 'Elite Match fit' technology that aims to cushion common injury areas, as well as providing a better touch through less material being used.
