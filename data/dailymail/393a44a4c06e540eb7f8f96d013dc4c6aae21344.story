An unconscious patient secretly raped in A&E by a male nurse who filmed the attack admitted today she tried to kill herself after police revealed her ordeal.

The victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic by Andrew Hutchinson, 29, as they lay in hospital beds at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012.

Sex offenders: Nurses Andrew Hutchinson and Oliver Balicao were able to rape patients at the A&E at John Radcliffe Hospital - where unconscious patients are now being treated in open areas

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, "That’s not me" but I had my mum round and she said, "That is you."

'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help.

'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'.

The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious.

She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear.

She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol.

Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' 

It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade.

In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital.

A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson’s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. 

But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients.

A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks.

The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman’s skirt as she stood by her sick friend’s bedside.

Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent.

He also used the medical camera – which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients – to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre.

The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women’s changing rooms and raised the alarm.

Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone.

Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him.

He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug.

The court heard that police had identified ten victims – females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre.

His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department.

Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. 

At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own - he will be sentenced next month.

Mark Power, Director of Workforce at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The ultimate responsibility for these appalling offences must rest with Andrew Hutchinson. Our staff have been devastated by his actions and his betrayal of their trust. It is not possible to eliminate the risk of a rogue practitioner entirely.

'This does not absolve anybody from learning lessons from these terrible events and we have taken steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening again. Our emergency department is now busier than ever and patients who are unconscious are treated in one area of the department with open visibility. At the time of the offences, this group of patients were more spread out within the department.'

It emerged today that it is not the first rape scandal on its A&E ward.

Nurse Oliver Balicao raped a teenager in a side room after she had been rushed to hospital after an overdose in 2004.

Her mother and the girl’s boyfriend did not believe her because she was hallucinating but years later she came forward and he was convicted in 2010. 

Balicao had even used a condom to hide DNA evidence in the premeditated attack. 

He was also found guilty of a sexual assault on a 22-year-old PHD student who was attacked in her hospital bed. 

Balicao was previously jailed in 2007 for 16 months for having sex with a 16-year-old patient in a disabled toilet at the hospital after she had overdosed on paracetamol.

The girl had accused him of raping her when luring her in saying she needed to do a urine test - but a jury cleared him of rape and accepted a guilty plea of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.
