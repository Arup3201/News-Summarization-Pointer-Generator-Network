Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who slaughtered 77 people in the country's worst peacetime massacre, is pleading to be let out of prison to attend the funeral of his mother.

Breivik and his mother Wenche Behring Breivik met earlier this month at Ila Prison where Breivik is being held, his lawyer Tord Jordet said today.

She died on Friday after a long illness, according to her lawyer Ragnhild Torgersen. She was 66.

'He was allowed to say goodbye. They both knew it would be the final meeting,' Mr Jordet said. 'I spoke to him this morning. He was grieving. It was very sad news to him.'

Breivik and Mr Jordet also discussed whether the confessed mass murder would like to attend her funeral.Â 

'He would like to do so but it is up to the prison (board) to decide,' Mr Jordet said.

The 34-year-old right-wing fanatic killed 77 people in twin attacks on July 22, 2011, in Norway's worst peacetime massacre.

He detonated a car bomb outside 
government offices in Oslo killing eight people and then drove to the 
island of Utoya where he massacred 69 in a shooting spree at the summer 
camp of the governing Labour Party's youth wing.

Five years before the massacre, Breivik had moved back to live with his mother and ended all social contacts.

His
mother never attended Breivik's 10-week trial for health reasons, but 
in a statement read in court she said Breivik had fabricated 
information.

Breivik and his mother had telephone 
contacts in recent months because she was not able to visit him in 
prison for health reasons, Mr Jordet said.

'He told me they had completely 
opposite ideological views but they had a good mother and son 
relationship,' the lawyer said. 'He regarded her as a good mother.'

Last
year, the Oslo District Court found Breivik guilty of terrorism and 
premeditated murder for the attacks. He was given a 21-year prison 
sentence that can be extended if he's considered a threat.

The self-styled anti-Muslim militant denied criminal guilt, saying he's a commander of a resistance movement aiming to overthrow European governments and replace them with 'patriotic' regimes that will deport Muslim immigrants.

Police said they found no evidence of Breivik belonging to any such group.
