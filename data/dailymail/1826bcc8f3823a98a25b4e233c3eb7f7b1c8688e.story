Bob Peeters had wanted an FA Cup run to galvanise his struggling Charlton side, so this defeat will only heap further worry on a club going backwards.

The Addicks had started the season looking as if they’d be challenging the Championship’s top six but appear more likely to become embroiled in a dogfight at the bottom should this winless run stretch much longer than its current eight games.

Even the floodlights packed up on the hosts, suspending the first half for 10 minutes and the manager saw Yoni Buyens meekly sent off for a second booking which summed up another dour afternoon.

Going with what is close to their best XI, Charlton lacked ideas or invention against a Blackburn team who maximised their squad depth with seven changes.

The league is much more important for Gary Bowyer - he has designs of the play-offs - but it was the visitors who meant business and were ahead inside four minutes. Craig Conway teased down the left and floated a cross towards Chris Taylor, starting his first game since September, to head beyond Neil Etheridge.

They should have been out of sight long before this was eventually over. Chris Brown, all alone at the back post, could only head straight at the goalkeeper, while Conway skewed wide when it was easier to score.

It had all the hallmarks of a game between two Championship sides suffering for form and was - for the majority - a rather rank affair. But this third round clash was lit up by a moment of invention from the lively Johann Gudmundsson who - standing over a dead ball 30 yards out - spotted Simon Eastwood too far across his line and wonderfully beat the goalkeeper at the near post.

Charlton were level for just four minutes though. Taylor got his second, but was indebted to the team move preceding it. The imperious David Dunn jinked in midfield, keeping hold of possession, before Liam Williamson knocked a super through-ball into Brown’s path and he found Taylor to thunder in.

There was time for Tom Cairney to rattle the bar late on, but this was done well before then.
