Made from six savoury layers and four sweet ones, this 12-inch-tall pancake tower has been dubbed The Beast and contains 2,500 calories - the same as an average man's daily intake.

Stuffed with cheese, cajun chicken, salami, Nutella, peanut butter, chocolate and a fried egg with maple syrup, the £15 meal has been created by chef Faisal Mayet who is challenging diners to finish it in less than 10 minutes  on Shrove Tuesday.

Hearty eaters who successfully battle their way through the American-style meal at Pancake Corner in Urmston, Greater Manchester, get the dish for free.

Diners will have to finish the £15 American-style pancake dish if they want to get it for free  

Mr Mayet, 27, said: 'I think it's pretty calorific. A stack of four American pancakes with just maple syrup is about 600 calories.

'I think it has got to be possible to finish it. We did a trial a while back with a just a stack of 10 plain pancakes and two out of four people succeeded, although one didn't do it in the time.

'Obviously this is a lot more, and there are many different flavours to contest with but I reckon someone out there will take it on and do it! 

'I am not sure how all these different flavours like Nutella with spinach, or chicken with chocolate or even mayonnaise with toffee sauce are going to work out. That's why it's a challenge.'

The layers are made up of American-style pancakes topped with Italian tomato sauce and cheese, followed by a layer of Cajun chicken and BBQ sauce, and a layer of marinated chicken mayo and black pepper.

The pancake tower also includes layers of spinach, tomato and cheese and also a pancake topped with salami.

Four sweet layers of strawberry and Nutella, peanut butter and sliced banana, hazelnut, slice banana and toffee sauce and a mix of milk and white chocolate buttons complete the dish. 

On top of the pancake tower is a fried egg smothered in maple syrup.

The tower costs £15 and must be finished in just 10 minutes with winners getting the dish for free.

In order to make the tower, which takes 15 minutes, Faisal and his team follow a strict plan of assembling the tower with the savoury pancakes at the bottom because they take the longest to cook.

Mr Mayet added: 'We wanted to do something different this Pancake Day.

'We have a lot of these ingredients on the menu and we thought, how weird would it be to put them all together. You see these really delicious looking pancake towers with strawberries and cream only.

'We thought what if we just did everything you could have on a pancake and made it into a tower. It is kind of like having five layer as of main course followed by a five layers of dessert. It is definitely something no one else will have thought about.'

Jacob Moss tries - and fails - to demolish the calorific pancake tower, which is on sale in Greater Manchester

Challenger Jacob Moss, 24, from Salford, a council worker, said: 'I couldn't eat it, not a chance and I'm a big eater! When I first saw it I thought 'that looks easy!

'I watch Man Vs Food and it looked nothing like that. I thought "I can do this". 

'Then I got stuck in and there was not a chance I was finishing it. It was much more difficult than I thought. All the fillings are really hard to get through. I was there for about 40 minutes and by that point I had only eaten a quarter.

'This is definitely a challenge to do and with all those different fillings and textures and flavours it became really hard to get through. I would have a go at it again. It is deceptively hard!'
