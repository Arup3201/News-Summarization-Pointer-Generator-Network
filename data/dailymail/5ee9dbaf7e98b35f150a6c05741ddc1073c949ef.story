This is the incredible moment a man trapped under a 13-tonne bus was rescued by a group of more than 20 passengers and onlookers.

Chang Suibin was knocked down by the bus in China's Henan province on Friday and became stuck with his hip underneath the front right wheel of the bus.

Passengers on the bus, pedestrians  at the traffic lights and onlookers then all grouped together to lift the bus so the man could be pulled free in under three minutes.

He was taken to a nearby hospital with a pelvic fracture and is currently receiving further treatment.

'My sincere thanks to everybody, to the friends, to the kindhearted people of Zhengzhou.... Good people can be found everywhere in our society,' said Mr Suibin.

Local traffic police officer Tang Xiaoqi was reportedly first on the scene and waved for people to help the rescue effort.

He said: 'People nearby, passengers from the bus and pedestrians waiting at the traffic lights by this intersection all came together to lift the bus. We failed at first, but then more people joined in - some lifting and some pulling the victim - and eventually we got him out.'
