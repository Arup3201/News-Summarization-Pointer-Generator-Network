Roberto Martinez has admitted he is unlikely to sign a striker to replace Samuel Eto'o as he backed Arouna Kone to deliver Everton's goals.

Eto'o completed his move to Sampdoria earlier this week, which leaves Everton, who have failed to score in four of their last six Barclays Premier League fixtures, with Romelu Lukaku and Kone as the only recognised strikers.

Kone has endured a wretched time at Goodison Park, scoring only once since his £5million move from Wigan in June 2013 and being restricted to a handful of starts because of a serious knee problem, but Martinez's faith in him is total.

'At the moment Kone is fully fit and ready to give a lot to the team so we do not need anyone to replace Samuel Eto'o in that position,' said Martinez, whose squad have just returned from a warm weather training break in Qatar.

'We have players performing in that number 10 position – Ross Barkley and Steven Naismith - and with Romelu and Arouna we are strong in that department.

'We are not looking at this window to find solutions. We worked in the summer to find solutions so the work is to get players back in confident mood. We have not lost any of the talent of last season. Saying that we will always try to use the window in our favour. The work now is to recover the confident mood of the players.'

Martinez also insisted that the penalty miss by Kevin Mirallas is now 'water under the bridge'

Martinez - who insists the controversial penalty miss from Kevin Mirallas against West Brom is now 'water under the bridge' - is hopeful that key midfielder James McCarthy will be back to face Crystal Palace on Saturday. The Republic of Ireland midfielder has been sorely missed during his absence because of a hamstring problem but his manager now feels he is ready to relaunch his campaign.

'James is a very important player,' said Martinez. 'He will be refreshed and fully fit. We want him to get back and be the same way. He had been a real important part of the success that we had last season and we want him back as quick as we can.

We are facing a team that is full of confidence and in a very good moment of their season. We are well aware of how difficult it will be. They have a lot of pace and defend very well. We know that we are in a position where we want to get more points. We have a chance to be ourselves again and kick start our season. We have seen that Selhurst Park is a really tough place to go but we are looking forward to going there.'
