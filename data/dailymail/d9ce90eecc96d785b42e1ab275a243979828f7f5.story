A hillwalker who died in the Scottish mountains has been named by police.

James Jack, 57, was found yesterday in the Streap area, near Fort William, in the West Highlands, which is still under heavy winter conditions.

Mr Jack, who was known as Jim, was from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, and his family has been informed.

Northern Constabulary said their search and recovery of the body was supported by the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team and an RAF helicopter.

The Walk Highlands website describes Streap, which has a peak of 994 yards, as a 'magnificent mountain' but warns of 'very rough, rocky and often pathless' conditions.

The death is the latest in a series of accidents in the Scottish mountains this year.

Four people were killed during an avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian in 
January. The only survivor was able to stop his fall with an ice axe.

Another avalanche in the Cairngorms in February claimed the lives of 
three people, while in the same week a second avalanche killed a 
hillwalker.

Two climbers were also killed in falls on Ben Nevis.

On Friday, a group of hillwalkers escaped with only minor injuries following an avalanche in the Cairngorms.

A spokesman for the Northern Constabulary said: 'Police can confirm that the body of a 57-year-old male has been recovered from the Streap area, Glenfinnan, following a search by the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team and RAF Helicopter Rescue One Three Seven.

The Met Office is currently warning of sub-zero temperatures and storm force winds across the West Highland regions.

Police have said it is not yet possible to link the death to the weather.

It came on the same day that a body of a man was discovered in Wick River, in the north Highlands close to John o'Groats.

A spokesman for the Northern Constabulary said its specialist crime division are currently investigating the death.

In total 13 climbers and walkers have died on Scotland`s mountains this year - seven of them in avalanches.

The latest death comes after a major safety warning was issued by Britain's top mountaineering bodies for climbers and walkers to be 'realistic about the seriousness' on Scottish mountains.

'It will soon be Easter, but it's still full-on winter in Scotland's mountains,' said the councils, who represent more than 85,000 members between them.

'We advise that climbers and hill walkers need to be realistic about the seriousness of the Scottish mountains at this popular time of year, and of the need to match knowledge and experience to mountaineering objectives.'

Mountaineering Council of Scotland president, Brian Linington, said: 'There are always more visitors to Scottish mountains at Easter and Whitsun and we urge them to act upon this advice.

'Many are keen to get to grips with the mountains, but the pattern when I was part of the Skye Mountain Rescue Team was for a high number of incidents at Easter.

'This was due to a number of factors, including loose holds after winter ice had loosened everything up, together with very icy old snow patches in critical shaded spots.'
