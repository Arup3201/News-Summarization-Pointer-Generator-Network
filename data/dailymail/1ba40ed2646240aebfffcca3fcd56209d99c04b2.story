Rosemary Shearman, 72, was found murdered in the living room of her home in Hornchurch, Essex, on September 3 last year

A gambling addict who murdered an elderly member of his bridge club by stuffing a handkerchief in her mouth and beating her to death, has been jailed for 18 years.

Thomaz Blazquez, a former Crown Prosecution Service worker, harboured ‘violent fantasies’ against Rosemary Shearman, 72, for six months because she owed him £30.

Blazquez, 51, battered his victim and tied her up before killing her in the living room of her £500,000 detached home in Hornchurch, Essex, on September 3 last year.

Mrs Shearman, a mother and grandmother who knew her attacker through the Gidea Bridge Club in Essex, was waiting alone at her house for a taxi to take her to Dover for a luxury cruise when she let her murderer in.

Her body was discovered when the taxi driver arrived at her home but got no reply. He alerted neighbours who found her body lying on the living room and contacted police.

A post-mortem revealed she had died of asphyxiation and blows to her stomach and hand.

When officers arrived they found Blazquez, who worked for the Crown Prosecution Service for 25 years, in the bathroom trying to commit suicide.

The jury took only three hours to find Blazquez guilty at Southwark Crown Court today.

Judge Alistair McCreeth said: ‘Rosemary Shearman was a mother and a grandmother, someone with many about her who loved her and many who were her friends. Her death will be mourned by many.

‘The crime of murder carries only one sentence, imprisonment for life, and this is the sentence I now pass.'

Blazquez, who had worked for many years as a case worker in the Old Bailey before moving to the homicide unit in Pimlico, had a history of depression and mental health problems.

Colleagues said he worked for the agency’s team in the capital for almost a quarter of a century before leaving last November.

During that period he was involved in bringing to justice some of the country’s most high profile murderers and rapists.

On the day of the murder, Blazquez, who lived South Woodford, east London, but was staying at his parents in Hornchurch, Essex, set out to his victim's home carrying a bag with a rope, duct tape and a knife.

The jury heard when Mrs Shearman answered the door she was ‘friendly towards him’ saying he was lucky to catch her as she was about to go on a cruise.

He demanded the £30 she owed him and, when she refused to give it to him straight away he lost his temper and started hitting her.

Blazquez did not give evidence but his forensic psychiatrist Dr Carlo Longhitano told the court Blazquez had confessed to him while in custody at the John Howard institute.

The jury heard Mrs Shearman pleaded with him saying ‘I will do anything you want’ but Blazquez told the doctor ‘she kept talking and talking’ so he repeatedly hit her before tying her up.

He told the doctor: ‘I hit her in the stomach about three times, told her to keep quiet but she wouldn’t so I tried to put a handkerchief in her mouth and tie up her feet.’

He had earlier pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted the killing on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Judge McCreeth added the defendant was of ‘good character’ and his previous mental health problems should be taken into account when sentencing.

Police were called to Mrs Shearman's home in Essex after a taxi driver, who arrived to collect the grandmother to take her on holiday, raised the alarm when she failed to answer the door

He said: ‘The impairment of his mental functions, while of insufficient degree for diminished responsibility should in some measure reduce the minimum term.’

However he said the ‘savage’ nature of the ‘horrible murder’ argued against reducing the sentence to the minimum term.

He said: ‘This was the murder of an elderly woman who was therefore someone vulnerable which took place in her own home into which she had unwillingly admitted the defendant.

Friends described Mrs Shearman as a 'real giggle'

‘I accept he went to her home without the intention to kill her but as soon as he attacked her he was eager to do all he could to avoid the consequences of his actions and set about in a determined fashion to kill her.

‘It was a brutal attack, binding Rosemary, gagging her and carrying out a prolonged assault with blows, gagging and binding her despite her pleas and then stamping on her hand and chest. These are aggravating features.

‘Given the serious nature of the offence the minimum term should be 20 years, which I will shorten to 18 years.’

Prosecuting barrister Mark Dennis read out a statement from Mrs Shearman’s son Greg Shearman in which he spoke of the ‘devastation’ the death had caused.

‘On behalf of all the family the devastation and trauma this has caused us, and the community in which my mother lived for her entire life, is very difficult to put into words. We have lost a mother and grandmother.’

Mrs Shearman, a grandmother of five, had moved into the house with her husband Albert in 1979. Mr Shearman, a company director, died five years ago.

She was a constant fixture at a weekly social group in her area and would take frequent trips with friends to the coast or abroad.

On the day she was killed she was preparing to travel to the Canary Islands for a cruise.

Charlotte Fitch Murphy, who runs the Ardleigh House Community Association where Mrs Shearman was a regular, described her as a ‘real giggle’.

‘She would come to all our events, would pop in to the centre several times a week and would go on every trip going,’ she said following her death last year.

'She loved sports, would play bowls and tennis and table tennis, and would make sure she had her tickets for Wimbledon every year.

'We went to Brighton for the day and we had a real laugh - we saw people sunbathing nude on the beach and she thought it was a hoot.

'We also went to Eastbourne for four days in June and to Whitstable for a day in July. And she had already paid the deposit for a trip to Turkey in December.'

Mrs Shearman leaves behind a son, who runs a catering business in Wales, and a daughter who lives in Hong Kong.

A CPS spokeswoman confirmed that Blazquez worked for CPS London as a case worker between January 1988 and November 2012.
