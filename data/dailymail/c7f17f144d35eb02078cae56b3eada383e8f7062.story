Nine people have been arrested after up to 50 teenagers and adults started a huge brawl after a high school basketball game.

The violent scenes unfolded at Whitehaven High School in Memphis, Tennessee, with people punching and kicking each other before police officers swarmed the auditorium on Friday night.

Two juveniles - aged 15 and 17 - were arrested along with seven other adult men following the game which saw the home team lose to local rivals Hamilton 76-54.

Response: Police cars swarm around Whitehaven High School in Memphis, Tennessee, after a huge brawl involving 50 people broke out at a basketball game 

Booked: Rashad Thompson and Deadrick Simmons were two of nine arrested as a result of the fight which took place during the game between Whitehaven and Local rivals Hamilton 

Brandon Moncrief, Deadrick Simmons, Rashad Thompson, Calvin Daily and Martez Farmer were all booked into a local jail. 

However, police records suggest they have not yet been charged.  

Marcus Johnson, who lives across the street from the school, told WMC Action News: 'Its kind of surprising that something like that escalated.

He added: 'I guess its always a possibility that kind of stuff can happen. But its just kind of weird that people would want to do that as big as the police presence usually is over in that area.

'They take care of business they don't you know start a whole lot of trouble, so I mean maybe its just a one time thing.' 

Fight: Brandon Moncrief was also detained following the altercation at the school's auditorium (right), but police records suggest no one has been charged
