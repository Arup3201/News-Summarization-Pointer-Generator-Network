Brendan Rodgers has warned Liverpool may have to endure further short-term pain before they can finally turn their ailing season around.

Though there was some good news for Rodgers on Friday when Daniel Sturridge signed a new incentivised five-year contract, which could see him earn up to £150,000 per week, there are still a number of issues for the Liverpool manager to solve.

Chief among them is how he sparks an upturn in Liverpool’s form. They have not won in the Barclays Premier League since August 31 and their Champions League aspirations are in jeopardy after an anaemic performance in Basle that Rodgers branded ‘soft’.

Liverpool face a potentially awkward fixture at home to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday afternoon and Rodgers has admitted the significant transition that went on at Anfield during the summer — and the process of bedding in new players — means they are vulnerable.

‘It’s hard for the supporters and I understand that,’ said Rodgers, who is considering giving Rickie Lambert his first Premier League start for Liverpool today.

‘It must be so difficult to see a team that for 18 months has been so fluent and dynamic. Now they probably look and see a team with maybe no resemblance to that in many ways.

‘I understand that and there is no-one more frustrated. We look at our game, which is based a lot on possession, but we’re also a big threat in transition when we’ve won the ball back and we’re on the break. We don’t look a threat at the moment.

'I think the pain is for now. We lost a top-class player (Luis Suarez) and then had to bring in other players to help us now and for the future. Once these players settle in and adapt, and really understand how we work, we’ll move back to where we were.

‘There will be frustration now, absolutely. No-one respects that more than me. We have to work hard to get them settled and bedded in. These are players we believe will be outstanding but sometimes it takes a wee bit of time.’

Sturridge certainly has faith that Rodgers will find the formula to get Liverpool winning again and he revealed that his decision to extend his contract to the summer of 2019 was based on his belief that he will compete for the major honours.

 ‘We were so close to success last season and it was a bitter pill to take not winning the league,’ said Sturridge. ‘But that’s just a taster of what the fans will get — but hopefully this time we’ll have the trophies to show for it.

‘Everyone is very obsessive in terms of wanting success and being winners. That’s what we are — that’s the Liverpool way. It’s the Liverpool way of life. The way the manager wants us to implement his style, his football, I think we will have success in the future and I’m just looking forward to those days when we’ll be lifting trophies and celebrating.’
