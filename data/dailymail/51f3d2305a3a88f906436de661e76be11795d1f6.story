Gareth Bale's first-half brace against Levante on Sunday helped Real Madrid to their first win in three games and also provided the perfect response for the Welshman to some of the recent individual criticism he has faced.

World-record signing Bale had not scored in the nine games preceding the clash with Levante and had been the target of plenty of boos and whistles around the Santiago Bernabeu stadium; and following his opening goal on 18 minutes, the winger made a point of venting his frustration, covering his ears and kicking the corner flag. 

Spanish sports newspaper Marca splashes on Bale and Real's timely return to form ahead of their La Liga title showdown with Barcelona next week.

AS say that Bale's inspired performance against Levante can help Real Madrid to regain their confidence

AS leads with a similar line, 'Bale therapy for the Nou Camp,' suggesting that the player's goals are the ideal tonic for Los Blancos' recent dip in confidence after some disappointing results.

Elsewhere, Mundo Deportivo previews Barcelona's Champions League last 16 second-leg with Manchester City. Barca currently lead City 2-1 on aggregate following their win at the Etihad Stadium back in February, and the magazine spotlights talisman Lionel Messi as the Catalan side's main goal threat. The Argentinian forward scored twice against Eibar on Saturday to bring his seasonal tally to 43.

Mundo Deportivo's match report of Real Madrid's game, meanwhile, centres in on a sub-plot of Bale's renaissance - the seeming unhappiness of team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo. Indeed, Ronaldo was visibly frustrated after his failed bicycle kick was cleared off the line, only for Bale to pounce on the rebound. It was hardly the action of a man playing solely for his team.
