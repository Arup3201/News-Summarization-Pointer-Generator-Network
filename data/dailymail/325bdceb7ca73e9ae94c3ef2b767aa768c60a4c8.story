QPR's Charlie Austin has hailed the 'exceptional form' of Tottenham forward Harry Kane, insisting the 21-year-old is a shining example of what confidence can do for a striker.

Kane's two goals fired Spurs to a 2-1 win over Rangers on Saturday and took his personal tally to 26 goals in all competitions this season.

Austin and Kane are both jostling for a spot in Roy Hodgson's England squad, which is announced later this month, but the QPR striker had only praise for his compatriot.

'Harry Kane has been in exceptional form this season,' Austin told paddypower.com.

'He was the difference between us and Tottenham on Saturday - and he is a great example of this self-belief.

'That brace makes it eight goals in six league games and when you're on that run you just want the games to keep coming.

'He's confident going into games, and he's confident when he's front of goal that he's going to score.

'That's the kind of confidence that a striker really wants and it will inevitably benefit the team.'

Austin has enjoyed an excellent campaign himself, scoring 15 goals in his debut season in the top flight.

A dip in form saw Austin score just once in seven matches at the start of the year but two goals in his last three games suggests the 25-year-old his rediscovering his rhythm.

'If you're a confident striker the ball will always fall to you in the right positions,' Austin said.

'If you're in form there's nothing stopping you picking the ball up 25 yards out and having a shot, whereas a striker low on confidence might play it out wide and be slightly more conservative.

'If you get the goal to kick-start the run, your self-belief keeps growing and you know you'll keep getting chances to score.'

Austin is only five away from reaching the 20-goal mark in the league this season but the striker insists he has not set any targets.

'I've never got into the habit of setting myself personal targets,' Austin added.

'If you set yourself a target you can give yourself something to achieve, but if you don't hit those aims you see yourself as a failure.

'For me that isn't a motivation. It was my first season in the Premier League this year and I wanted to go in all guns blazing and just see what I could do.'
