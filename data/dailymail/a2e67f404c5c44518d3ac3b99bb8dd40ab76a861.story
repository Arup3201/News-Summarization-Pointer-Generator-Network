A self-styled 'Al Qaeda gunman' was shot and wounded in the French city of Toulouse today after holding four hostages during a six-hour siege of a bank.

Armed tactical police stormed the branch of Credit Industrial and Commercial (CIC) shortly before 5pm, releasing the manager and another senior member of staff.

Two others had been released earlier in the day by the 26-year-old, named only as 'Bouzema', who had fired a shot during a would-be robbery.

The drama took place just 100 yards from where Islamic terrorist Mohammed Merah, 23, died in a hail of bullets after holing-up in his flat for 32 hours after he had himself killed seven people in March.

Referring to today's drama, local police union spokesman Cedric Delage said: 'It's an attempt at an armed theft which has turned into a hostage situation.'

The gunman is said to have taken hostages when a bank employee refused to give him cash, said Mr Delage.

But, despite his claim to be a terrorist, the gunman was a known schizophrenic with a 'strong religious conviction', according to a spokesman for the Toulouse Prosecutor.

The man had asked for officers of the elite RAID tactical unit who killed Merah to attend the scene, but instead their brother police unit, the GIPN, went in.

Shots were heard, along with small explosions as doors were blown off their hinge, and within minutes the man had been captured.

He was wounded in the stomach, but was in a 'stable' condition and likely to make a full recovery, said a local police spokesman.Â 

Staff at the Caousou college confirmed that all of there 2,000 odd students - from kindergarten age to 18 - had been sent home during the siege.

Among those evacuated were four- and five-year-olds from a private language school next to the bank.

Valerie Ruckly-Gravier, who heads the
 Happy Momes school, or Happy Kids, said police advised that the 
security parameters in place could last throughout the day.

'I had to call the parents ... The 
police accompanied the group to the parents at the end of the street,' 
Ruckly-Gravier said by telephone.

The gunman's sister, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said he was an 'angry' character who had 'fear of the outside world.'

There had originally been fears that the 'Al Qaeda operative' wanted to gain his revenge for what happened to Merah, possibly by initiating a shoot-out with the RAID.

Merah's father, Benalel Merah, had accused the unit of 'executing' his son and is currently trying to sue the French government over what happened.

Mr Merah senior, who lives in Algeria, has filed a lawsuit in Paris against those 'at the top of the police force who gave the orders' to kill his son.

Scene: This bank in Toulouse is where a self-styled member of Al Qaeda has taken hostages

Merah, who was born and brought up in Toulouse, confessed to killing seven people, including Jewish children and three soldiers, in a rampage caused outrage across the world.

It later emerged that Merah had attended terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and that he had links with Al Qaeda groups.

There have been fears since the atrocities that Merah was working with other Islamic radicals in France and that they might strike at any time.

Merah's older brother, Abdelkader Merah, is currently being held in a high-security prison on suspicion of assisting his brother in the seven murders.

Elite RAID officers assaulted the French national weather centre in Toulouse earlier this month when another gunman took hostages. He was seriously wounded but nobody else was hurt.
