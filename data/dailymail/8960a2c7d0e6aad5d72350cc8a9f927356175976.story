Guests at this boutique hotel in North Carolina can leave with more than a good night’s stay.

When customers arrive at the Aloft hotel in downtown Asheville they are greeted by an adorable dog wearing an ‘Adopt Me’ vest.

It is believed to be one of the first hotels in the world where guests can adopt an animal during their stay.

It’s part of an adoption programme run by the hotel and Charlie’s Angels Animal Rescue, a local organisation which finds ‘forever homes’ for dogs, cats and other pets that may otherwise be euthanized at a shelter.

Fourteen dogs have been adopted since the programme started last July.

Jan Trantham, from Atlanta, and her husband, Will, adopted a two-year-old Shih Tzu named Jackson after falling in love with the dog when they checked in.

She said: ‘Every time we went somewhere, one of us would say, “Let's go back to the hotel and see Jackson.”

‘I couldn't stop thinking about this dog.’

Caren Ferris of Amherst, Massachusetts, and her husband, John, adopted a four-year-old terrier mix named Ginger after filling out paperwork and paying $175 in fees (approximately £110).

They met the dog, wearing an ‘Adopt Me’ vest, as they were sat in the hotel bar.

Caren said: ‘I got up to leave and told her goodbye. She sat up, looked me in the eye and kissed me on the lips.

‘So I called the shelter, thinking maybe we should adopt the dog.’

But it’s not that easy to take one of the dogs home. Charlie’s Angels has strict adoption standards, including a home visit.

The programme has been such a hit that the hotel and pet rescue organisation hope it will become permanent and spread to other locations within the pet-friendly Aloft chain.

Located in a mountain tourist mecca the hotel allows guests' pets to stay for free and hosts only one adoptable dog at a time.

There are reserved spaces for the dogs, including the reception desk and roof, but they are not allowed to stay in guests’ rooms.

However they can go with guests to the restaurant or bar if they’re on a lead.

Christine Kavanagh, Aloft’s director of sales, said: ‘We feel like we are saving lives.

‘The guests love it. It shows up on guest reviews and consumer surveys.’

She added: ‘We have a little playpen by the front desk. At times, there's a crowd around the pen because the dog is a conversation starter.

‘Our hotel draws people together so they can mix and mingle and maybe adopt a dog.’
