As if snowboarding wasn’t enough of a rush, one British thrillseeker has decided to do the sport using electric jet thrusters.

Jamie Barrow, the UK’s fastest snowboarder, set a world record earlier this year using electric engines at the St Moritz resort in Switzerland.

The Swiss-born sportsman was able to reach a speed of 50.1mph (80.63 kph) on a flat stretch using nothing but the electric thrusters to propel him.

‘It might sound a bit crazy to begin with - "Oh yeah, I'm going to be propelled along by electric jet engines", said the University of Bath graduate.

‘But in reality, it's not as bad as it sounds. You're not going to take off and fly somewhere.’

The jet engine record attempt began when Mr Barrow was contacted by Adam Contoret from Staffordshire-based DreamScience.

Mr Contoret came up with the idea for the device after he tried his hand at paramotoring and found he didn't like the experience of strapping a huge engine on his back.

Dreamscience said recent advances in lithium polymer battery technology have made it  possible to power four eight-kW motors.

These each turn spin fan blades at speeds of up to 30,000 rpm.

To use the device, the rider holds onto the central bar and controls thrust with either a thumb throttle or bite control.

Adam Contoret, the inventor of the device, hopes the the thrusters will also be used to improve jump height and push riders up hills.

'It's like a jet on a runway,’ he said. ‘It seems slow at first and before you know it you're just going like a rocket.'

He decided to develop his own thrust system that could be used by skiers, windsurfers, skater and snowboarders .

‘The thruster is a very powerful motor driving a fan, about 30,000 rpm,’ Mr Contoret told Gizmag.com.

‘A modern jet engine has a turbojet propulser module at the core of the engine and this drives a large fan at the front of the engine that generates most of the thrust.

‘Electric motor technology has recently progressed to the level where the turbojet core can be replaced with a high power electric motor.’

Dreamscience’s latest prototype uses four 8 kW motor-powered thrusters, along with a lithium-polymer battery pack to power the motors.

To use the device, the rider holds onto the central bar and controls thrust with either a thumb throttle or bite control.

The world record, by Jamie Barrow, was set on a frozen lake at St Moritz resort in Switzerland. The Swiss-born sportman was able to reach a speed of 50.1mph (80.63 kph) on a flat stretch using nothing but the electric thrusters to propel him

Mr Contoret hopes the the thrusters will also be used to improve jump height and push riders up hills.

'It's like a jet on a runway,’ he said. ‘It seems slow at first and before you know it you're just going like a rocket.

‘I see devices like this becoming extreme sport devices to get up skiers up slopes and to go wind surfing when there’s no wind.’

While the device isn’t currently on sale, Dreamscience said it estimates a future retail price to be around $5,000 (£3,000) and $10,000 (£5,970).
