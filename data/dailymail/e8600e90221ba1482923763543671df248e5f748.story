Fifty per cent of women admit to using them - and a little known fact is that they were the fifth domestic appliance to be made electric, following the sewing machine, fan, kettle, and toaster.

But nonetheless, the vibrator is still a taboo topic.

Worse still, travelling with one - particularly in these days of hand luggage only - has the potential to turn into a humiliating nightmare (just ask Tulisa Contostavlos, who was stopped at airport security because 'something' in her bag was vibrating.)

But one company think they have the answer.

Lovehoney have unveiled the Tingletip - a discreet £9.99 gizmo that fits directly on to your electric toothbrush.

Discreet? A sexy toy company have unveiled the £9.99 Tingletip, which fits onto your electric toothbrush and acts as a vibrator

Designed to be fitted on top of your electric toothbrush, the device, which says it is designed to work with 'all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes' uses the vibrations of the brush to turn the covered tip into a clitoral stimulator.

Describing the intriguing device on their website, manufacturers Lovehoney call it 'a breakthrough in electric toothbrush technology'.

Nothing to see here! The vibrator is perfect for sneaking through airport security

'Unlike 
anything else on the market, the Tingletip fits directly on to your 
electric toothbrush (not over the top), producing orgasmic vibrations 
from start to finish,' they say.

Speaking about the device, sexpert Tracey Cox said: 'They're
actually quite good and more powerful than they look.

'Plus ideal for women who
feel embarrassed about travelling with a traditional vibrator in case their
bags get searched.

'A lot of vibrators that are designed to look like other
everyday gadgets have very weak vibration, whereas this one does the job. It's
not as silly as it seems!'
