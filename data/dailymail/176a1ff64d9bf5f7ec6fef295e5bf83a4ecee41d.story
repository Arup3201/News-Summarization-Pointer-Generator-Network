A mother whose teenage son committed suicide has revealed her battle to come to terms with his devastating, untimely death.

Lisa Schenke's 18-year-old son Tim walked in front of a train on April 26, 2008 following a battle with depression, alcohol and drugs.

The teenager's death was the first in a cluster of shocking teenage suicides over a four-year period which shook Monmouth County, New Jersey.

In her book Without Tim, published this week, Mrs Schenke, 53, describes how she channeled the pain of losing her child into community work - becoming a tireless advocate on suicide awareness at rallies and organizations, reaching out to young people in pain.

Tragic loss: Tim Schenke, 18, committed suicide in 2008 following a battle with depression and substance abuse

Two months after the death of Tim Schenke, a fellow student Andrew M. Clark Jr., 18, at Manasquan High School walked in front of a train on graduation night in June 2008.

Joseph Calton-Henehan, 20, who had recently graduated from high school, stepped out in front of a train two months later.

In April 2011, a 19-year-old teenage girl Lily Seegobin, who was studying at Rutger's University, was killed after she drove on to train tracks in her car.

In the most recent suicide, a 15-year-old boy from Spring Lake Heights was struck by a train in February 2012.

According to an article about the Manasquan suicide outbreak, during this dark period 19 other students were rescued from suicide attempts by police while dozens more were taken to psychiatric units after displaying suicidal signs.

In total nine students took their own lives in southern Monmouth County - seven lost their lives on train tracks.

The tragic loss of young lives has become one of the largest in a disturbing phenomenon of suicide clusters in the U.S.

Mrs Schenke, who has two other sons 
now studying at college, has made it her mission to reach out to young 
people in trouble and raise suicide awareness.

Without Tim by Lisa Schenke is out this week

She wants no other families to suffer the loss of a child like she has. Tim was an exceptionally 
bright teenage boy, who had won a 
$100,000 college scholarship to study engineering before his tragic death.

Mrs Schenke told nj.com: 'I want the contagion to stop. I want 
young people to understand that life will get better.

'And I want to help
people who might be suffering from the same things that Tim did.'

At first she spoke to her Tim's friends, devastated in the wake of his death.

Soon, friends of friends began reaching out to her and parents called the Schenke family home to ask her to speak with troubled teenagers about the pain that suicide leaves behind.

Mrs Schenke is one of an army of people in the New Jersey area who have come together to let young people know that they are not alone with their problems.Â 

Teachers, counselors, health workers, parents and police officers have all united together to show that help is at hand.
