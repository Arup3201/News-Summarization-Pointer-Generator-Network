 Bristol Palin is moving out.

The daughter of political pundit Sarah Palin and sometimes reality star has listed her home in Wasilla, Alaska for $549,000, a steep increase from the $388,000 she paid for the property back in 2011.

This as she has just announced her engagement to former Marine and Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer.

Palin bought the home in 2011 for $388,000 and has since remodeled parts of the house

She lives in the 3-bed, 3.5-bath 3,200 sq. ft. abode with her son Tripp

The increase in price is also due to the fact that Palin remodeled the 3-bed, 3.5-bath 3,200 sq. ft. abode where she lived with son, Tripp, according to TMZ.

It is not yet known where Palin plans to move, though in the past she did spend time in both California and Arizona. 

Meyer popped the question to Palin in Las Vegas last Friday at a Rascall Flatts concert, and the pair shared their big news the next day.

'He’s so romantic!' said Palin on her blog.

'He asked me to marry him at a Rascal Flatts concert. The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated “Bless the Broken Road” to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!

She then added; 'It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands. He really is good and His plans are so much greater than our own.' 

Then remodeling of the house caused the increase in price

Palin and Meyer, who met on the set of Sarah Palin's Amazing America TV show, have been dating for just under a year

Mom Sarah seems to be a big fan of Meyer as well, sharing a photo of him and her daughter on social media celebrating the big news.

This will be the first marriage for both, though Palin was briefly engaged to Tripp's father Levi Johnston.
