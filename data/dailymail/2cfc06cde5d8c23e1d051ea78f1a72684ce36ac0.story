The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoyed a concert in Ottawa last night to round off a busy Canada Day.

Kate dazzled in a purple Issa Jersey dress as the Royal couple laughed and clapped while they watched acts from across the country joining 100,000 people on Parliament Hill.

They were the guests of honour at the event which was part of the national celebrations marking Canada's 144th birthday. Kate had changed her clothes from her earlier red and white outfit - Canada's national colours - into the purple dress, making it an impressive five outfits in 24 hours.

Fashion queen: Kate wore a Issa Jersey dress with black shoes and had her hair swept back in a chignon. It was her fifth change in 24 hours

She was still wearing the maple leaf 
brooch, which the Queen has loaned her for the tour - a glittering 
diamond piece in the form of the national emblem of Canada.

The Duke and
 Duchess sat in the audience for around half an hour watching acts Great Big Sea, Tragically Hip and Weezer before leaving for a private event where they viewed the finale 
fireworks.

Earlier as they arrived for an official 
Canada Day show in an open-topped landau, the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge looked simply overwhelmed by the adulation – and the heat.

Intimate: Kate and William were seen laughing and joking at the music event but they also shared several romantic moments during the evening

More than half a million flag waving 
people crammed the streets of the city – many having travelled hundreds,
 if not thousands of miles - just to catch a glimpse of the glamorous 
newly-weds in temperatures of more than 90F.

In a speech to the crowds at the 
event the Duke told them how he and his wife were 'excited' by the 
prospect of becoming 'part of the Canadian family' as they travel around
 the country during the next seven days.

The second-in-line to the throne 
said: 'To be here on Canada Day - a day of unity, a day of coming 
together as families, and as a nation - is even more special for us.'

Rapturous welcome: First job of the day for Prince William and his wife Catherine was at the Canadian Museum of Civilisation  where they took part in a citizenship ceremony to mark Canada Day. The Duchess of Cambridge wore a red hat with maple leaves

While many were keen to see the 
prince, there is little doubt that it is Kate, 29, who is winning their 
hearts in what is widely considered to be a dress rehearsal for the rest
 of her public life.

Television channels and newspapers 
are offering wall to wall coverage of the new Duchess’s charm offensive -
 and while she insists she doesn’t want to be seen as just a ‘clothes 
horse’, Kate did not disappoint.

In her first 24 hours on Canadian 
soil there have no fewer than five different outfits, beginning with the
 £575 smart navy Smythe les Vestes blazer, Roland Mouret shift and 
Manolo Bhlanik pumps she sported on leaving Heathrow on Thursday.

This was followed by a blue and cream
 lace Erdem dress and her much-loved £175 LK Bennett cream pumps for her
 first two engagements, a visit to the National War Memorial followed by
 a formal welcome at Government House.

In the evening there was a ‘fun’ BBQ 
with the cream of Canada’s youth for which Kate rolled out another pair 
of old favourites, the Issa bird print wrap dress she wore the day 
before she got married with a pair of Pied a Terre sling back wedge 
heels.

Today there were another outfit to 
wow the crowds including another familiar sight, the cream £159 Nanette 
dress by high street store Reiss that she wore for her engagement 
portrait. The dress was topped off with a Sylvia Fletcher for Lock and Co hat.

Proudly pinned to the Duchess’s dress
 was The Queen Mother’s diamond Maple Leaf brooch, given to the late 
monarch  by the people of Canada in 1939 and passed down through a 
generation of royal women.

She accessorised this time with an on-trend Anya Hindmarch tan and coral clutch, in the shape of a fan.

At the museum, there were 25 people from 14 countries who became Canadian citizens in front of the Royal couple

Her final outfit was to be unveiled overnight at an evening pop and rock concert.

And next week Kate is set to create a
 stir again when she dons full ‘western’ dress including jeans, shirt 
and cowboy boot at a rodeo in Calgary.

On their first full day of 
engagements in Ottawa, the launch pad for their gruelling 11 day tour of
 Canada and the U.S., the couple attended a Citizenship Ceremony.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper 
welcomed them to an afternoon program at Parliament Hill as 'the world's
 most famous newlyweds' and said they represent 'our unbreakable link 
with our past and our unqualified optimism for the future'.

The Royal couple watched intently while 25 young 
men and women – from vastly different backgrounds and cultures -  became
 fully-fledged Canadians.

Each took the Oath of Citizenship, professing loyalty to the prince’s grandmother, the Queen.

As each new citizen stepped forward, 
William presented them with a folded Canadian flag before his wife then 
handed over a small hand flag.

Then it was off to the official 
Canada Day celebrations in an open-topped carriage similar to the one 
the couple used on the way back to Buckingham Palace following their 
April wedding.

The state landau was built in the 
1890s from hand-wrought iron and carved wood. It was bought by Governor 
General Earl Grey in 1911 for $4,000 and donated to the nation.

But the stifling heat took its toll and Kate’s make-up began to melt. She gestured towards her cheeks and told Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s wife Laureen: ‘I’m just so hot. It’s incredible.’

As they arrived, the crowds - many 
waving home-made banners saying Canada loves William and Kate - went 
wild and their reception was akin to a pop concert.

The couple took their places in a 
VVIP section and watched the two hour show designed to celebrate the 
nation’s 144th birthday and featured both music and military displays.

William also gave a short speech to 
thunderous applause and high pitched screams in which he thanked the 
Canadian people for their welcome.

He talked of his and Kate's family ties to Canada - in
 French and English, as he had a day earlier.

The star attraction: Signs carried by the crowd included 'Canada loves Will and Kate'

Prince William said that Kate had learned about 
Canada from her late grandfather, 'who held this country dear to his 
heart for he trained in Alberta as a young pilot during the Second World
 War'.

On his side, he spoke of his 
grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. The queen, he said, 'has asked me to 
convey her warmest good wishes to the people of Canada, and her happy 
and abiding memories of being on Parliament Hill with Thee Duke of 
Edinburgh one year ago'.

The prince referred to his 
grandmother as 'the Queen of Canada,' since she remains Canada's head of
 state, drawing a loud cheer from the crowd.

He said the queen was watching their Canada tour with interest.

Aides have told the Mail the couple 
have been ‘thrilled and touched’ by the way in which the country – where
 the Queen is still head of state – has taken them to their hearts.

‘It’s unbelievable. I don’t any of us expected anything like this,’ 
they said.

Some people had waited through the night to see the Royal couple
