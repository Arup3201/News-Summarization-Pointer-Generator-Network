Newcastle head coach John Carver says the pressure is all on Everton and their under-fire boss Roberto Martinez ahead of Sunday’s meeting at Goodison Park.

Carver was on Merseyside to witness the Toffees come from behind to win 2-1 against Dynamo Kiev in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday night.

But he was taken aback by the level of unrest on the terraces after they fell behind early on.

‘I've got to be honest, it was pretty daunting. I was there with Steve Stone and Dave Watson, an Everton legend, and he'd never seen that before - he found it quite strange,’ said Carver.

‘So I’ve said to my players that all the pressure is going to be on Everton at Goodison Park.

‘They coped with it well in the end and got a good goal and dominated the second half. They deserved credit for coming back to win.

‘But there’s no pressure on us, the players can go and express themselves.’ 

Everton are 16th in the Premier League after a campaign disrupted by their participation in Europe.

And Carver has sympathy with Martinez given his own experience of a relegation battle in 2013 as Newcastle juggled the demands of a Europa League schedule.

‘It’s difficult to balance the demands of the Europa League and we can vouch for that when you’ve got a squad like we had then and they have now, it’s very difficult,’ he said. 

‘They’ve played 14 games more than us. Only the sides with huge squads will cope. It needs to go back to a knockout competition.’
