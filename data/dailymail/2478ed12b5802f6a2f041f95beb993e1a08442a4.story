Current and former NASA astronauts are furious over a new Beyonce video that samples audio from the failed 1986 Challenger mission which resulted in the death of all on board.

Her new video for XO features audio taken just after the Challenger broke apart. 'Flight controllers here looking very 
carefully at the situation. Obviously a major malfunction,' a 
NASA public affairs official said as wreckage fell toward earth on live TV.

The Challenger exploded 73 seconds after taking off from the Kennedy Space Center January 28, 1986. All seven 
crew members aboard were killed.

ABC News reported 'former and current NASA astronauts, 
employees and Challenger family members argue that using it in a pop 
song mocks the crew's sacrifice and opens fresh wounds.'

June 
Scobee Rodgers, the widow of Challenger Space Shuttle Commander Dick 
Scobee and a founder of the Challenger Center for Space Science 
Education, told ABC News she was not happy.

'We were disappointed to learn that an audio
 clip from the day we lost our heroic Challenger crew was used in the 
song XO,' she said.

'The moment included in this song is an 
emotionally difficult one for the Challenger families, colleagues and 
friends,' she added.

'We have always chosen to focus not on how our loved ones were 
lost, but rather on how they lived and how their legacy lives on today.'

Not happy: June Scobee Rodgers is one of many coming out against Beyonce over the song. her husband Francis 'Dick' Scobee was the commander of the challenger and she became a widow after 1986. Pictured above with her son

Keith
 Cowing, a former NASA employee who now runs the NASAWatch.com website, 
said, 'This choice of historic and solemn audio is inappropriate in the 
extreme.'

He is asking that the Texan remove the clip and apologize to families of the Challenger crew.

But on Monday the 32-year-old defended her use of the clip in a statement to ABC News: 'The song XO was recorded with 
the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones.'

The Halo singer added the reference should 'remind us that unexpected things happen,' so people should 'love and appreciate every
 minute that you have with those who mean the most to you.'

She also said, 'My heart goes out to the families of 
those lost in the Challenger disaster.'

Her statement ended with: 'The songwriters included the audio 
in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that 
they will never be forgotten.'

Not making friends: Astronauts, former NASA employees and the family of those who perished on the mission say they are disappointed about the inappropriate use of the clip. Above, a still from the XO video

Her response: On Monday the singer apologized in a statement to ABC News after being called 'insensitive'

The song XO - written and produced by Ryean Tedder and Terius Nash, also known as The Dream - is about loving while you can.

The video features the Sasha Fierce entertainer running through an amusement park with two friends.

They laugh as they ride roller coasters together and meet strangers.

The lyrics include: 'Your love is bright as ever/ Even in the shadows/ Baby kiss me/ Before they turn the lights out/ Your heart is glowing/ And I'm crashing into you.'

The wife of Jay-Z also sings, 'We don't have forever/ Baby daylight's wasting.'

Oddly, Beyonce has worked with NASA in the past: She recorded a wake-up announcement for the orbiting crew of the STS-135 shuttle flight

Always partying: On Friday Beyonce's husband Jay-Z (far right) had his arm around The Game, who was one of the writers on XO
