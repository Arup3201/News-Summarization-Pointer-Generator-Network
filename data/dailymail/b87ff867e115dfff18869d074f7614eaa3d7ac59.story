Kevin Sutherland made history on the Champions Tour on Saturday by becoming the first person to card a sub-60 round, with a magical 59 seeing him storm to the top of the Dick's Sporting Goods Open leaderboard.

Perhaps what is most remarkable about the 50-year-old's record is that he made a bogey on the final hole of his second round, with his tee on the 18th finding the rough costing him a chance of recording 14-under-par 58.

He began the day at Endicott, New York by incredibly picking up shots at the first eight holes, the highlight of which was an eagle at the par-five fifth to approach the turn in 28.

History: Kevin Sutherland became the first person to card a sub-60 round on the Champions Tour

Final: Remarkably, Sutherland actually made a bogey on the final hole of the round

He birdied the 10th and 11th and then added another three from the 15th, and only needed a par on the last to completea sensational 58.

It was not to be, but he settled for a 13-under-par round that featured 12 birdies to move to 14-under-par overall, three shots clear of his nearest challenger.

While the feat has not been achieved on the Champions Tour before now, six players have carded 59s on the PGA Tour.

Card: The 50-year-old golfer scored 59 as he stormed to the top of the leaderboard in New York

Success: Sutherland picked up shots in each of the first eight holes, including a brilliant eagle on a par-five
