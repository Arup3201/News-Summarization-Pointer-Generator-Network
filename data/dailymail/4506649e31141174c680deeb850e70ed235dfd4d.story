A speeding train slammed into a bus carrying kindergarteners to their school as it crossed tracks in a city south of Cairo, killing at least 50.

All but two of the dead were children, aged around four to eight, according to a senior security official near to the scene of the crash.

A woman and the bus driver also died in the crash near to the village of al-Mandara in the Manfaloot district of the Assiut province, he said.

The bus, which was carrying around 60 children earlier today, was broken in half by the force of the crash.

Witnesses said barriers at the rail crossing were open when the train hit the bus.

Transport Minister Mohamed Rashad and the head of the railways authority Mustafa Qenawi have resigned, and President Mohammed Mursi said those responsible would be held to account.

Prime Minister Hisham Kandil ordered an investigation into the crash and travelled to the scene.

A security official said it seems the railroad crossing was not closed as the train sped toward it, leading to the crash about 300 km (190 miles) south of the capital.   

Accidents
traced to negligence regularly left scores dead during the rule of 
ousted President Hosni Mubarak, who was accused of valuing loyalty over 
competence in many appointments of senior officials.

State media reported that as well as 50 
dead, 15 or more people were injured. A medical source said as many as 
28 were injured, 27 of them children.

This is the worst such tragedy since the country's first freely elected president, Mohammed Morsi, took power this summer.

Books,
school bags and children's socks were strewn along the tracks near the 
mangled bus. Parents of the missing wailed as they looked for signs of 
their children.

An Associated Press reporter at the scene said many of the remains were unrecognisable.

A
woman who called herself Um Ibrahim, a mother of three, was pulling her
hair in distress. 'My children! I didn't feed you before you left,' she
wailed.

One witness said the train pushed the bus along the tracks for nearly a kilometer (half mile).

As one man picked up a body part he screamed: 'Only God can help!'

Egypt's railway system has a poor safety record, mostly blamed on badly maintained equipment and poor management.

Earlier this month, at least three Egyptians were killed and more than 30 injured in a train crash in Fayoum, another city south of Cairo. In July, 15 people were injured in Giza, close to the capital, when a train derailed.

The railway's worst disaster took place in February 2002 when a train heading to southern Egypt caught fire, killing 363 people.

Media reports quoted official statistics saying that the rail and road accidents claimed more than 7,000 lives in 2010.

Resignation: Egyptian Transport Minister Rashad al-Mateeni, who resigned following today's tragedy

In al-Mandara village, along the 
tracks, angry families and locals gathered around the scene of the 
traffic, shouting at officials. Some chanted: 'Down with Morsi!'

Sheik Mohammed Hassan, a villager, 
said the government should be paying more attention to its domestic 
problems instead of focusing its attention to the violence in 
neighboring Gaza.

'The blood of people in Assiut is more important than Gaza,' he said.

While official reports said 47 
children had died, a doctor at a hospital in Assiut said the death toll was 38, among them 37 young children.

'They 
told us the barriers were open when the bus crossed the tracks and the 
train collided with it,' doctor Mohamed Samir said, citing witness 
accounts.

He said four children and two women had also been seriously injured in the accident.

Assiut Governor Yahya Keshk also said the crossing was open. 'The crossing worker was asleep. He has been detained,' he told state television.
