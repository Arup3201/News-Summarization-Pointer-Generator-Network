Families who have their holidays ruined by long flight delays will at last be able to claim compensation.

A landmark ruling has opened the floodgates for hundreds of thousands of claims, and could cost airlines millions.

It demonstrated that Britons have the right to compensation of up to £480, plus expenses, for hold-ups longer than three hours.

Last October the European Court of 
Justice ruled that delays caused by airline failures, such as technical 
faults or a lack of flight crew, merited compensation.

This week a judge in Staffordshire implemented that decision for the first time.

He awarded a former teacher and his wife £680, after their flight home from Tenerife with Thomas Cook was delayed by 22 hours.

Jeff Halsall won £680 from Thomas Cook on Monday in a landmark case that could open the doors to other claims from thousands of passengers

The decision is a major reversal for 
airlines, and consumer groups say it will ensure they treat travellers 
more fairly in future.

Historically, critics say, the firms have rejected most claims as a matter of course.

Airlines will still be able to deny payouts where delays are outside their control, such as during bad weather or strikes.

But, in theory, travellers can now claim compensation for flight delays dating back to 2005.

More than 200million passengers use UK airports each year.

Crude estimates suggest that two 
million of these are delayed for more than three hours, with at least 
400,000 eligible for compensation.

The Staffordshire case relates to Jeff and Joyce Halsall, from Kidsgrove, who took Thomas Cook to court in 2009.

A judge initially rejected the claim 
after the holiday company, which runs its own airline, said the delay 
was due to an ‘exceptional circumstance’ beyond its control. In fact, 
the flight, on October 31, 2009, was delayed by a mechanical fault.

Mr Halsall, 58, appealed against the 
decision after learning of the European legislation, which allows people
to claim between £200 and £480 if they are delayed for more than three 
hours.

On Monday the couple won the case. A 
judge at Stoke-on-Trent County Court awarded 800 euros (£680) in 
compensation and expenses incurred in pursuing the legal action.

Mr Halsall, a retired economics and business teacher, whose compensation claim was initially rejected

Mr Halsall, a retired economics and 
business teacher, said: ‘I am delighted to have won my legal case and I 
certainly hope passengers who were fobbed off over the past five years 
can now claim back what is owed to them.

‘It doesn’t matter how much people pay
for their flight, everyone is entitled to this. People probably think 
they have to go to court to do this but they don’t, all they need to do 
is write to their airline.’

The Civil Aviation Authority said Mr Halsall’s legal victory appears to be the first in Britain since the European ruling.

Raymond Veldkamp runs a website called
Flight Delayed, which helps travellers fight for compensation. He 
estimates that as many as two million suffer delays of more than three 
hours when using UK airports each year.

If half of these were the airline’s 
fault, one million might be eligible for compensation. Even if that 
figure was only one in five, 400,000 would still be eligible.

Mr Veldkamp estimates £73million is owed to travellers across Europe for the past five years.

Catherine Beader, the Lib Dem MEP for 
South East England, said: ‘It is vitally important to raise awareness of
this legislation because many simply do not realise they may be 
entitled to compensation.’

Thomas Cook apologised to Mr and Mrs Halsall for their 22-hour delay on a flight from Tenerife to the East Midlands because of a technical fault

Thomas Cook said it had offered Mr Halsall more money than the figure eventually awarded by the court.

A spokesman said: ‘We appreciate how 
frustrating flight delays can be and we’ve reiterated our apology to Mr 
Halsall for the lengthy wait he and his wife experienced. 

‘We always look at claims such as this fairly and make every effort to resolve complaints without the need for a court hearing.’

Passengers wait to hear of any news about their flight departures after long delays and cancellations due to severe cold weather this month

If your flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled or overbooked, you may be able to claim.

Compensation is £199 for inter-EU flights of 930 miles or less, £320 for flights between 930 and 1,860 miles and £480 for other journeys.

It applies to any flight leaving an EU airport and any flight into the EU on an EU-based airline.

Passengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number, names and reason for the delay. If rejected, the case can go to county court.

Flight-delayed.co.uk will pursue a claim for a fee of £14 or £20.50, and the Civil Aviation Authority’s website lets people download a standard letter that they can fill out and send to the airline.
