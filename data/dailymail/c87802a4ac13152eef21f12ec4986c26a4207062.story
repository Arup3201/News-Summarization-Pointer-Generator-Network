It was Demba Ba’s unlikely hurrah and the away goals rule which did for Paris Saint-Germain in Europe last season, but as they approach the beginning of a new campaign in which they will once again target Champions League glory, a more fundamental obstacle lays in their way.

The French champions, enhanced by the untold wealth of Qatar Sports Investments since 2011, were sanctioned similarly to Manchester City for breaching UEFA’s financial fair play regulations and have had to tailor their moves in the transfer market accordingly.

When winning the continent’s premier club title by 2016 has been the stated target all along, it was unsurprising to hear club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi call the punishment a ‘tremendous handicap’.

PSG were fined £49million, told not to increase their wage bill for the next two campaigns, and to ‘significantly limit spending’ in the market while curbing losses to no more than £24m next year.

Laurent Blanc’s team have won the last two Ligue 1 crowns, finishing ahead of Monaco at a canter last season by nine points, and with France’s other mega-wealthy side losing James Rodriguez to Real Madrid this summer it seems a formality the domestic title will once more head to the capital.

But it is in the Champions League where the owners want success, explaining why PSG paid a staggering £50m for David Luiz, who won the trophy with Chelsea in 2012. ‘To be clear -- the players I want, I'll have them,’ Al-Khelaifi had also said. Luiz joins Marquinhos, who moved from Roma last summer, in a rather costly Brazilian centre back pairing.

Such a purchase may seem to fly in the face of the financial regulations but it should be their only large cash signing this window. A different method beckons.

Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier has signed from Toulouse on a season-long loan with an option to make the move permanent, circumventing the transfer cap for this season. A similar arrangement could also bring Argentina winger Angel Di Maria from Madrid to Paris.

Yohan Cabaye, signed for £20m from Newcastle in January, is another addition to the squad which started last season’s Champions League with a 4-1 win at Olympiacos.

2012-13: Champions League quarter final - lost on away goals (3-3) to Barceloba 

2013-14: Champions League quarter final - lost on away goals (3-3) to Chelsea

The conundrum for Blanc was always how to fit £53m man Edinson Cavani with star performer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who cost £31m in 2012. The Uruguayan was upset at playing out wide while the Swede plundered 40 goals in all competitions and has been consistently linked with a move away.

Cavani, who scored 16 league goals in his debut campaign, said last week that he would be staying but he added: ‘It is important for an attacker to play in a position that is natural for him. Everyone knows what my position is and there is no point talking about it again.’

Ibrahimovic will see this as an important season too however. He turns 33 in October and perhaps this is his final opportunity to win the trophy he and his club covet most.

He scored both PSG goals against Guingamp to win France’s curtain-raising Champions Trophy in Beijing last weekend – one a long-range screamer – and in a poll for L’Equipe, 65 per cent said he would be the top scorer for the third year running.

Decisions to make: Blanc has had great success on French soil, now it's time to beat FFP and win in Europe

But despite all the silverware that had followed Qatari gold, Ibrahimovic knows the main objective. ‘To do better than last season,’ he said. ‘We had a fantastic season winning three trophies. We are focused on keeping this project growing and moving forward.

‘There is pressure on us but the players who are here are used to that. To say that we are a great team is not enough. We have to prove it on the field.’

PSG start the season on Friday night with a match away at Reims but Luiz, Thiago Silva and Maxwell have not featured in pre-season following the World Cup, and Cabaye, Blaise Matuidi and Ezequiel Lavezzi are also behind schedule.

‘The beginning of the season is as complicated as it was last season,’ said Blanc. ‘We will try not to give up too many points on the road but I'm happy with what the players have done so far.’

To be truly satisfied, success further afield must follow.
