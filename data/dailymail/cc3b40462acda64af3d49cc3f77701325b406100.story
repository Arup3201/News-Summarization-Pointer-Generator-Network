Susan Oliver, 48, is living in fear after armed robbers burst into her home in Scunthorpe where they tied her up and threatened to kill her 

A homeowner was tied up by a gang of robbers who threatened her with a 12-inch carving knife before stealing her £30,000 life savings.

Susan Oliver, 48, was at home in Scunthorpe in August last year when the three intruders burst into her property and carried out the terrifying raid.

The balaclava-clad gang beat their victim, leaving her with a broken nose and a suspected broken cheek, before threatening to kill her if she reported the horrifying attack to police.

The men, one of whom was also carrying a hammer, even threatened to cut off Mrs Oliver's toe during the hour-long ordeal.

Pardeep Kandola, 23, from Walsall, West Midlands, has now been jailed for nine years and four months after pleading guilty to armed robbery.

But his accomplices have still not been caught, leaving Mrs Oliver afraid of being alone in her home.

She said: 'I cannot even begin to come to terms with what's happened.

'I lived in the three-bedroom property quite happily for 15 years, now I can't be home alone.

'I have post-traumatic stress disorder and am undergoing weekly counselling sessions to help me overcome the ordeal.'

Grimsby Crown Court heard how Mrs Oliver was relaxing on her sofa when she heard a loud knock.

When she opened her front door, the men burst in, pushing Mrs Oliver  to the ground. She was also struck on the back of the head with a hammer, before being dragged across the floor.

The men then tied Mrs Oliver's ankles, wrists and knees up with tape, before Kandola began brandishing the large knife he had taken from the kitchen.

They then punched and threatened Mrs Oliver, as she begged for mercy. The men ran off, ransacking the property until they found her safe.

She said: 'I was in so much shock I could barely comprehend what was happening, and hoped it was just a nightmare.

'The pain barely registered at the time, I was numb with terror. My hands were bound behind my back so I felt even more vulnerable. I didn't cry or scream. I just begged them not to hurt me.

'The whole time they were shouting insults at me, calling me a "white slut". I was terrified they were going to rape and kill me.'

The gang then forced Mrs Oliver to reveal where her safe was, before ransacking each room until it was found.  

She added: 'I tried saying the safe was at the gym, but they knew I was lying. He knew exactly what he was after. He ransacked the upstairs rooms searching for my safe.

'Then he came downstairs to search. He found it in my study under the stairs in about ten minutes, but obviously it was locked.

'Downstairs, Kandola started slapping me round the face, demanding to know the code for the safe.

'I wouldn't tell him, and when I refused, he continued to hit me.' 

The men also took a £2,500 Rolex watch during the raid.

But Mrs Oliver's home insurance only covered up to £2,000, meaning she has lost her savings.

Kandola was caught after police found his DNA on saliva left on tape used to gag and bind Susan. 

Mrs Oliver has now installed CCTV in every room of her house and linked it to her smartphone so she can check rooms are empty before she goes in.

Humberside Police said they were still hunting the other two men.

Detective Constable Mark Lilleyman said: 'Two further arrests have been made and two men aged 30 and 24 have been released on bail as our enquiries are continuing.

'This is still very much an ongoing investigation and anyone who feels they may have information which could assist our enquiries is asked to call us.'
