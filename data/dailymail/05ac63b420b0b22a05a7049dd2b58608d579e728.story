Amelie Mauresmo has pledged that she will try to bring a female touch to Andy Murray’s coaching, while emphasising that her job is simply to help him win more Grand Slams.

On the day Rafael Nadal retained his French Open title Murray sent shockwaves through the tennis world yesterday by appointing the 34 year-old former Wimbledon champion and world number one as his coach for the grass court season, and almost certainly beyond.

'I think he's maybe looking for something different, about emotions and sensitive things,' said Mauresmo, although she played down the symbolism of what is an unprecedented move for such a top male player.

Bold step: Murray, who began training for the grass season today, has caused a stir by appointing Mauresmo

Proven class: Mauresmo was women's number won and won two grand slams, including Wimbledon

'It's not really interesting for me, this part of the story, to be honest.  All I'm interested in is to be able to help him in his goals. He’s an amazingly talented tennis player and I feel I have plenty to offer him.

'It will change a little bit my life and my retirement, let's say.  I'm passionate about this sport. Miracles don’t happen overnight but I love challenges.'

Mauresmo added that they had agreed to work for a ‘significant amount of weeks’ per year, assuming that the initial period is satisfactory.

Murray explained the background to a move being seen as smashing a glass ceiling for female coaching: 'I spoke to her a few times on the phone and when I was in Paris I met her before the tournament,' he said.

'We chatted a little bit about it, whether she’d be up for doing it. There was a will from both sides to give it a go and see how it works out.

Shared experience: Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006 while Murray finally took the title last year

Watching on: Mauresmo was at the French Open final on Sunday before starting work with Andy Murray

'She’s obviously a fantastic player. She won Wimbledon, was World No. 1, won the Australian Open. Just from speaking to her, she’s very calm, she’ s a good person. I think we will communicate well together and I think that’s a very important part of coaching.

' I obviously worked with my Mum for a long time,  even periods when I was 16, 17 years old. For me it doesn’t feel like a very different thing. Obviously I wasn’t paying my Mum so it’ll be a little bit different this time around because I’ll be employing Amelie. I think it’s exciting, something a bit new for me, something a bit fresh and hopefully it works well.'

Martina Navratilova was among those pleased to see Murray taking such a bold and agenda-setting step:, tweeting: 'An interesting call by Andy Murray. Cool to see a woman coaching a top guy. Hope it works out for them.'

Mary Pierce, a French contemporary of Mauresmo who knows her well, told the BBC: 'She is a great person, she's got great values and a sense of hard work but she has a great sense of humour.

'She knows what it takes to win Grand Slams, what it takes to get to number one, she will take it very seriously and give her absolute best to help Andy.'

Anguish: Murray had a strong French open before being thrashed by Rafael Nadal in the semi-final

Repeat success: Murray is desperate to replicate his win in SW19 last year after a promising French open

Two of the men who know Murray best from working with him, his ex-coaches Brad Gilbert and Mark Petchey, believe he has made an intelligent choice.

'I think this is good news for Murray, she should be a calming influence,'  said Gilbert. ' She was a smart player with an outstanding knowledge of the game who brings a fresh perspective and I think she will add a lot to Andy’s team.'

Petchey added: 'I think it’s a sound move. Amelie is clearly someone Andy likes and respects and she will bring something different. There just wasn’t an ideal male coach out there, and so why not go with a woman who has plenty of knowledge.'
