A 34-year-old 'transient' crashed a classic 1930 Ford Model A coupe into a river in Oregon after pilfering it from a church parking lot.

Sheriff's deputies arrested Erik Blake Halpin, whom they described as a transient, after he swam to shore and was treated at a nearby hospital for his injuries. The charges were drunken driving, unauthorized use of a vehicle and Criminal Mischief in the First Degree.

The saga started when a 79-year-old man took the fully restored Model A to church on Sunday to show it off.
