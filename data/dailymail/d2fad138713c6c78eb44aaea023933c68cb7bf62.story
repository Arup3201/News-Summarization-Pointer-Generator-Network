Hertz is being sued by one of its customers after he was allegedly racially abused by employees of the car rental firm on Facebook.

Maurice Howard, 27, filed the complaint against the firm last week after staff at Hertz Rent-A-Car at Maui Airport, Hawaii, took to the social networking site to insult him in Pidgin English after he had hired a vehicle there.

Mr Howard's attorney, Burton Gould, described the employee's comments as a 'hate crime' in a statement.

The group of employees allegedly took to Facebook in February 2012 to describe Mr Howard as a pretentious black man who rented impressive cars including BMWs.

They mocked Mr Howard claiming that his credit card was often declined.

The posts use terminology that Mr Howard's lawyers claim imply that he is a black man of low social status who aspires, in a crude manner, to appear to be of higher status.

A post by another employee, Samantha Chun, reads: 'Run that faka over!!! lol.'

Suing: Maurice Howard is also attempting to sue Facebook claiming that is violated its anti-bullying policy by allowing the posts which appeared in February 2012

One of the members of staff named in the law suit, Shawn Akina, allegedly described Mr Howard as a 'broke ass faka who act like he get planny money'.

Mr Howard is also taking legal action against 
Facebook claiming that the site violated its policy banning content that
could be seen as bullying or causing emotional distress.

His lawyer claims that his client's civil rights were violated and cites negligence on the part of both Hertz and Facebook for allowing the group to mock him.

According to the Huffington Post, the Lawsuit says: 'Clearly the posting attacking and bullying Howard is a prima facie case of Facebook's own definition of "harmful content".

'Moreover, these same individuals, continue to have accounts on Facebook, despite Facebook's policies which explicitly state that such "harmful content" being posted on Facebook is grounds an individual's account be terminated.'

The group of employees were all either fired or resigned following the incident, according to the lawsuit.

The posts were reportedly deleted once Mr Howard was made aware of them.

Hawaii Pidgin English is a form of Creole language based on English and used by many residents of Hawaii in everyday conversation.

It was originally used as a form of communication between English speaking residents and non English speakers and is influenced by a range of languages including Portuguese and Cantonese.

Hawaii's official languages are English and Hawaiian.
