A pair of biscuits which amazingly survived some of the bloodiest battles of the First World War are to go under the hammer.

The bidding at Lockdales auctioneers in Martlesham, near Ipswich, Suffolk, will start at £60, but huge worldwide interest sparked by the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War make a much higher final figure likely.

A soldier, L. B Charles, who fought in the bloody battles of Gallipoli and the Dardanelles in Turkey, brought the biscuits home with him.

Tough: These biscuits from a major campaign in the First World War will go under the hammer next week. They are almost 100 years old

He is thought to be Lt Lionel Bruce Charles of the 5th Battalion, The Queen’s Regiment, said to have lived for a time at Wroxham House, Norwich.

The biscuits have been preserved for 99 years and now the bizarre war-time keepsakes are to be sold.

Each one has a label on that reads 'Biscuits used by troops in Suvla Bay', the Turkish peninsula captured by British forces after horrific fighting and massive losses.

Dr Rachel Duffett of the University of Essex is an expert on food eaten by soldiers during the conflict and is the author of 'The Stomach for Fighting: Food and the Soldiers of The Great War'.

She said: 'The reason they last so long is they're pretty much inedible. They're made from flour, salt and water and that's about it.

'They're rock hard.'

The three ingredients are mixed into a paste and then baked for about 45 minutes on a high heat -  a recipe Dr Duffett has tried.

She added: 'They are just dreadful. They're like the worst children's rusk ever.'

Could the one up for auction still be edible? Dr Duffett wouldn't advise taking a bite.

'I don't think they would kill you. I wouldn't want to try though.'

At the start of the war, British soldiers at the front were allowed 10oz of meat and 8oz of vegetables per day, but this soon fell as supply lines were disrupted due thanks to naval blockades and the chaos of war.

By 1916, the meat ration was down to 6oz a day, and as the war wore on, meat was only provided once every nine days.

Other goods provided - nearly always tinned - were tea, bacon, cheese, jam and (famously disgusting) meat stews.

Soldiers were forced to fend for themselves and reportedly grew vegetable patches in reserve trenches and hunted and fished in quiet moments.

Cooks tried to find local vegetables when possible, but were often forced to use weeds, nettles and leaves to add to stews and soups.

Flour was scarce in 1916 and ground-up turnips were used as a substitute, resulting in bread that gave soldiers severe stomach problems.

Tommies were also forced to endure pea-soup with horse meat chunks.

By the time troops began to land at Suvla Bay the Turks were well dug in - and exacted a terrible price

The biscuits are famous for the hardness and longevity that has seen many survive for nearly a century. Indeed, some were so tough soldiers turned them into picture frames.

The British Army had 12 different recipes for its biscuits and bought more than 129m lbs (58.5m kg) of biscuits in 1918 alone, at a cost of £3,394,000.

They were incredibly difficult to bite into, but soldiers would dunk them in their tea or crumble them into the stews that were a daily staple on the front line.

James Sadler, the auction manager of Lockdales, said: 'This 100th anniversary year since the start of The Great War makes all memorabilia from the period collectable, including biscuits.

'This lot is being viewed with great interest by many 1914-18 conflict collectors.'

The biscuits will be sold next Thursday, the second day of the special two-day fine arts sale.

British and French forces launched a massive naval attack on Turkish forces in the Dardanelles, the strategically vital strait in north-western Turkey separating Europe from Asia, in the spring of 1915.

The onslaught was opened on March 18 by 10 Allied battleships.

Allied forces had bombarded and destroyed Turkish forts near the entrance to the Dardanelles.

But the deadly waters were still heavily mined, forcing Britain and France to sweep the area before its fleet could set out.

Three battleships were sunk and two more badly damaged.

By the time troops began to land on April 25 the Turks were well dug in - and exacted a terrible price.

The landing at Suvla Bay was an amphibious landing made on the Aegean coast of the Gallipoli peninsula in the Ottoman Empire. It was a desperate attempt to break the deadlock of the Dardanelles Campaign but was hindered by mismanagement and the troops were eventually forced to retreat by a robust Turkish defence.

In the wake of the battle the British commander at Suvla, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford, was dismissed.

The 61-year-old slept as the landings took place and his performance in command is seen as one of the most incompetent feats of leadership of the Great War.

Allied troops were finally evacuated in December 1915 and January 1916 after months of bitter bloodshed in one of the most disastrous campaigns of the war.

The Turks lost 300,000 men and the Allies about 214,000.
