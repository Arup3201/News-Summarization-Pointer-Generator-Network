Four men in Saudi Arabia have been beheaded after dressing up as women in order to lure their victim away before robbing and killing him.

A Pakistani drug smuggler was also put to death on Thursday bringing the number of people executed in the kingdom this year up to 26, according to an AFP tally.

The Kingdom's Ministry of Interior said use of the death penalty in such cases was part of an effort to maintain security and 'justice.'

The four robbers, from Saudi Arabia, were executed after they were found guilty of donning women's garbs to lure a compatriot. Once they persuaded him to follow, they stole from him before murdering him. 

The men would have been wearing a burka or niqab, which is commonly worn by women in the conservative Muslim country and covers the entire body, including the hands, hair and face, with a small slit or mesh for the eyes.

They were executed in the eastern town of Qatif, the ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.

Abdelghani Mohammed Akbar, from Pakistan, who was convicted of trying to smuggle heroin into Saudi Arabia, was beheaded in the Riyadh region, the ministry said in a separate statement. 

The Gulf nation has faced constant international criticism over its human rights record, including its use of the death penalty.

Saudi Arabia executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013, according to an AFP tally.

Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under its strict version of Islamic sharia law.
