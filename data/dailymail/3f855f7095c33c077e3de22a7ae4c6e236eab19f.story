Allegations: Tina Baldwin has been suspended from her job at the University Hospital Birmingham after boasting about stealing supplies from wards

A hospital cleaner has been suspended after boasting about stealing medical equipment on Facebook and posting pictures of herself wearing a bedpan as a hat.

Tina Baldwin, 45, bragged on the social networking site about stealing supplies from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

Ms Baldwin joked about 'raiding' the wards at the hospital which treats thousands of service personnel injured in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

She posted: 'Been raiding my ward for supplies.

'Got loads of bandages, pads, sterile wipes, boxes of gloves, micropore tape, butterfly stitches, there's not much left LOL.'

Friends of Ms Baldwin congratulated her on the apparent thefts, to which she replied: 'Not a problem, unless I get caught LOL xx.'

When one friend asked her if there were any spare beds, she responded: 'Loads of em (sic), but don't think they would fit in my handbag LOL.'

Ms Baldwin also posed for a picture with a disposable bedpan on her head while holding up a pair of surgeon's gloves which are either inflated or full of liquid.

Although she has since deleted most of the posts from Facebook, they have quickly spread to Twitter, where some users have described her actions as 'disgusting'.

Twitter user Christopher Tulloch posted: 'This is one NHS worker I will not be upset about losing her job.'

Baberaham Lincoln added: 'What an impressive level of stupidity.'

Some users directed their tweets at West Midlands Police and called for a criminal investigation into the posts.

A spokesman for University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We take any complaint about the professionalism of our staff extremely seriously.

'The member of cleaning staff concerned has been suspended pending an investigation into the allegations made.'

West Midlands Police confirmed today that they had not been informed about the Facebook posts.

Speaking from her £114,000 semi-detached home in Northfield, Birmingham, Ms Baldwin declined to comment on the allegations and simply said: 'I haven’t done anything.'

Another man who also answered the door at the house added: 'F*** off, who gives a s*** what she (sic) done?'

Ms Baldwin's Facebook page also shows support for right-wing extremists the English Defence League (EDL).

Neighbours yesterday described Baldwin as a 'nightmare neighbour'.

One said: 'She's vile. You hear her talking loudly in the garden ranting about Muslims all the time.

Ms Baldwin refused to comment on the allegations when the Daily Mail approached her, just saying: 'I haven't done anything'

'She's a nightmare neighbour but quite scary.

'She's covered in tattoos and is always swearing.

'She's not a nice person to know. I'm not surprised she's been suspended from work.

'She comes across like she doesn't give a monkey's about anyone or anything.'

Last year surgeons at the University Hospital Birmingham rebuilt the skull of brave schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai after she was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman.
