A driver has been taken to hospital with broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder after his car ploughed into the side of a house, demolishing part of the property.

Police and emergency services were called to the scene in Hop Pole, near Spalding, Lincolnshire, just after 4pm yesterday afternoon.

No one is thought to have been in the property at the time of the crash, which demolished part of a rear bedroom of the semi-detached house.

Local resident Cedric Jordan, 78, told the Spalding Guardian: ‘I was sat down with a drink and my wife when I heard this bang.

‘But we didn’t realise it was an accident until we saw that the police had roped off the road. There were some people up by the car that crashed but the police moved them on.

‘We have problems with cars being driven fast but I can’t remember anything like this happening here for a long time. It’s terrible and it’s just one of those things that has changed about the world.’

A police spokesman said: ‘Police and emergency services are attending an incident in Carrington Drive, Hop Pole following the collision of a vehicle into a house. This occurred at just after 4pm on July 23.

'It's believed that one vehicle is involved and one person has been injured - no details as yet.

'Emergency services are in attendance. It's believed that the structure of the house has been affected by the collision and that it may be unsafe.

'There are currently a number of roads closed and diversions in place in the area, including Carrington Drive, Market Deeping roundabout and Littleworth Drove. Highways are attending to assist with diversions.

'Motorists are asked to avoid the area if possible, as continuing work at the scene by emergency service is anticipated. There will undoubtedly be delays on the affected and surrounding roads.'
