Mark Cavendish and Chris Froome are preparing for there bid to wear the Tour de France leader's by cycling the Yorkshire route of Saturday's Grand Depart.

The first stage is a 190km route that begins in Leeds and finishes in the centre of Harrogate - potentially culminating in a sprint finish.

And Cavendish - who has never led the Tour - will be hoping it does so that he can contest to wear the yellow jersey for the second stage between York and Sheffield.

Cavendish has never worn the maillot jaune at the Tour before but he looked relaxed and focused as he rode along Saturday's route.

Chris Froome, on the other hand, won the 2013 Tour and the Team Sky rider is the overwhelming favourite ahead of Alberto Contador to do so again.

A stage win in the Grand Depart would also give Cavendish the perfect start as he aims to reclaim the green jersey, awarded to the sprinter with the most points.

Having claimed the green jersey in 2011, the Omega Pharma-Quick Step rider has had to watch on as Slovakian Peter Sagan has won it in the last two years.

The Manxman will also come head-to-head with German Marcel Kittel - who won the most stages at last year's Tour - for the first time since he out-sprinted the 24-year-old at the Tirreno-Adriatico earlier in the year.
