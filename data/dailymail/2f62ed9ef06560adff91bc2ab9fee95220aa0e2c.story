England are perfectly placed to end close to a year of abject misery by finishing off a job they have started with four highly impressive days at the Ageas Bowl and level this Investec series with victory in the third Test.

A win that would be absolutely priceless for England will be sealed if they can take the remaining six Indian wickets and complete what has been up to now one of the most important and satisfying performances of Alastair Cook’s career.

One of the most successful England teams in modern memory have completely and spectacularly unravelled since that golden afternoon in Durham almost 12 months ago when Stuart Broad propelled them to a decisive 3-0 Ashes lead.

This is the 11th Test since then and only the core of Cook, Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Ian Bell and Joe Root are still standing amid the rubble of a return Ashes whitewash, much blood-letting and setbacks against Sri Lanka and India.

That long winless run culminated with an absolute horror show on the final day of the second Test at Lord’s when the very future of a ‘new’ England side under Cook was placed in jeopardy before it even had time to sprout roots.

If Lord’s was rock bottom then Southampton is assuredly the start of the long climb back, with both, crucially, those senior players and the many promising newcomers combining here to provide a display full of character and purpose.

Wednesday was the perfect example of how England have dug deep in those few days since they self-destructed at Lord’s. Firstly there was Anderson, back to his absolute best, quickly taking the last two Indian first innings wickets to complete his 16th five-wicket Test haul on his 32nd birthday.

Then Cook, whose captaincy was very much on the line ahead of this game, was at the heart of a perfectly paced England second innings which saw them score 205 for four in 40.4 overs, 125 of them coming in 19.5 overs after lunch which allowed Cook the luxury of a declaration ahead of tea.

Athleticism: Jos Buttler dives to take the ball as Kohli watches on

Cook’s unbeaten 70, compiled with the minimum of fuss typical when he is on top of his game, was complemented by rapid selfless contributions from Gary Ballance, Bell and, most impressively, Root, who hit 56 in 41 balls.

It was the fall of Root that led to Cook calling a halt with India needing a world record 445 to win but with England having a full 130 overs to get them out again, with not even his most vociferous critics feeling he had gone on too long.

There was much work for England still to do and when Anderson and Broad failed to make a breakthrough in the first 10 overs a team who have forgotten how to win could have thought back to Sri Lanka and let their heads drop.

Yet an inspired piece of fielding from Broad and the equally inspired decision by Cook to bring on Moeen Ali as early as the 12th over changed the course of the Indian innings, this Test and, perhaps, the series.

It is easy to forget that England were expected to rest Broad here, with his right knee injury becoming acute, but he was determined to play and, characteristically, has thrown himself into this Test, not least when the Indian openers tried to take a quick single to him just after the end of his first spell.

Broad, virtually on one leg, collected the ball at short mid-wicket, dived and under-armed a throw that registered a direct hit with Murali Vijay fractionally out of his ground. Duncan Fletcher, who always wanted England’s batsmen to dive in such circumstances when he was their coach, would have been fuming.

Then Cook, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. It always seemed likely that many of the doubts over Cook’s captaincy would be eased once he started scoring runs again and now, all of a sudden, neither his field placings nor bowling changes appeared in question.

Most significant of all was his faith in Moeen, who is starting to look more and more like a ‘specialist’ slow bowler at this level rather than the part-timer that Cook and Peter Moores insisted he was at the start of summer.

Firstly Moeen had Cheteshwar Pujara brilliantly caught by Chris Jordan at slip off his second ball and later he returned to have Virat Kohli well caught by Jos Buttler. Remarkably, Moeen now has 11 wickets in this series.

Sweeping statement: Ballance joined captain Cook and showed his intent

Over the top: Gary Ballance launches Rohit Sharma back over his head for six

Driving force: Sam Robson plays a positive shot - before nicking off again soon after

In between times Cook had taken off Moeen and brought on Root, a decision that seemed questionable until Root had Shikhar Dhawan caught by Jordan. It was a particularly enjoyable wicket for England, who had seen Dhawan survive 13 runs earlier despite being trapped absolutely plumb in front by Moeen.

It could have been even better for England had Anderson held on to a sharp caught and bowled chance offered by Rohit Sharma but India, at 112 for four, will need close to a miracle to leave here tonight with their 1-0 lead intact or even enhanced.

The sight of Anderson being warned by the umpires for aiming verbals at Ajinkya Rahane as he left the field was a reminder that he is facing a suspension tomorrow when he comes up in front of Australian beak Gordon Lewis.

It would be a huge blow for England if they are without their attack leader on his home ground of Old Trafford next week but if Anderson can help wrap up victory today it would make that particular setback a little easier to accept.
