President Obama’s former press secretary said today that he was specifically instructed by the White House not to acknowledge the administration’s use of drones.

Speaking Sunday on MSNBC’s ‘Up w/Chris Hayes’ Sunday, Robert Gibbs said that he was told when he was named White House Press Secretary that ‘one of the first things they told me was, “You’re not even to acknowledge the drone program.

‘”You’re not even to discuss that it exists,”’ the former press secretary and current MSNBC political analyst said.

Gag order: Former press secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday that he was told to deny the existence of the controversial drone program

Game of drones: The Obama administration has claimed transparency but has, until recently, denied the scope of the program's existence

Mr Gibbs’ statement today is in direct opposition of one of the Obama Administration’s mainstays – transparency.

‘You’re the official government spokesperson acting as if the entire program…pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,' he said on the MSNBC program.

The president said in a statement 
that his administration was striving to create ‘an unprecedented level 
of openness in government,’ saying that he would work ‘to ensure the 
public trust and establish a system of transparency, public 
participation, and collaboration.

‘Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in government,’ the president had said.

However, the administration has 
significantly expanded its drone program, deploying around 100 troops to
Niger in West Africa to target Al Qaeda. Drones will be used for 
surveillance, and ostensibly, for attacks.

Controversial: Drone strikes have been used increasingly to carry out dangerous missions

Mr Gibbs referenced a 2009 exchange with former Fox News reporter Major Garrett, who asked about the drone program.

‘I would get a question like that and
literally I couldn’t tell you what Major asked, because once I figured 
out it was about the drone program, I realize I’m not supposed to talk 
about it.’

The White House did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment on Mr Gibbs’ statement.

The former press secretary, who 
served under Mr Obama from 2009 until February 2011, was replaced by Jay
Carney. He recently joined MSNBC as a contributor, but said that his 
former job will not stop him from speaking ill about the White House, or
his old boss.

Mr Gibbs told the Washington Examiner
on Friday that his new job on the left-leaning MSNBC is not to sing the
president’s praises.

‘I don’t see (my new position) either
as being a cheerleader for the president or as a spokesman for the 
administration’s point of view,’ he said.

‘I will be honest with my opinions and when I believe the White House has made a mistake, I will say so.’

On ‘Up w/Chris Hayes’ Sunday, Mr 
Gibbs added that he believes the president must be more forthcoming. ‘I 
have not talked to him about this, so I want to be careful – this is my 
opinion – but I think what the president has seen is, our denial of the 
existence of the program when it’s obviously happening undermines 
people’s confidence overall in the decisions that their government 
makes.’

Earlier this month, members of 
Congress demanded to see copies of classified documents detailing the 
administration’s justification of drone strikes on U.S. citizens deemed 
to be a threat to national security, to which the White House originally
refused.

The Department of Justice White Paper
details in vague legal terms how the U.S. can target and kill American 
citizens and has caused an outcry from human rights groups, who say that
it is unconstitutional for a U.S. citizen to be killed without due 
process.

The 16-page document, entitled 
‘Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is
a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qaeda or an Associated Force,’ were 
first obtained by NBC News.
