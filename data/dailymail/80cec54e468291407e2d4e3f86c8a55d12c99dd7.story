Arsenal left back Nacho Monreal took to Twitter to reveal his admiration for American film The Notebook.

Monreal stated his love for the 2004 romantic drama film  on Wednesday night - when England were playing Norway and Germany were taking on Argentina in a repeat of the World Cup final earlier this summer. 

The 28-year-old defender, who was left out of Vicente del Bosque's recent Spain squad, called The Notebook 'a very good film'.

First choice: Nacho Monreal has featured in Arsenal's first five games due to an injury to Kieran Gibbs 

High praise: Arsenal defender Monreal seems to be a big fan of the 2004 romantic film

Released in 2004, The Notebook is a romantic drama starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. 

Monreal has been involved in all five of Arsenal's competitive games so far this season as first choice left back Kieran Gibbs has been out injured.

Gibbs lasted just 53 minutes of Arsenal's Premier League opener against Crystal Palace before being forced off with a hamstring injury.

Monreal will be hoping he can keep his place for Arsenal's upcoming Premier League match against Manchester City on September 13.
