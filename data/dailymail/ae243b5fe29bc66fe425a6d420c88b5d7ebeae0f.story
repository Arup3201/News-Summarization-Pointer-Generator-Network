Confectionary firm Carambar has axed a long-standing joke about Formula One ace Michael Schumacher from inside its sweet wrappers.

The gag, which appears in French, has been deemed to be in poor taste following the driver’s horrific skiing accident on December 29.

The joke read: 'What vegetable goes very fast and laughs when cornering? Answer: Le chou marreur (Schumacher)'.

A Carambar spokesman said the joke 'will not be used on any future packets'

A spokesperson for Carambar said: 'This joke has been pulled from production and will not be used on any future packets.'

The chewy, caramel stick sweet was first created in 1954 and is famous for its silly jokes.

It was seven weeks ago last Sunday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his life-threatening accident while skiing with his son in the French resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet.

He remains in intensive care as doctors try to ease him out of an artificially-induced coma.

On Monday investigators announced that the inquiry into his accident had closed and ruled out any wrongdoing.

Closing the case, Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, in charge of the inquiry, ruled 'no infraction by anyone has been turned up'.

He cleared the French ski resort of Meribel of any wrongdoing.

He said the accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off-piste area and that the resort had conformed to the French standards for marking ski runs.

He said: 'No one was found to have committed any offence. The accident occurred in an off-piste area. The signage, marking, staking (marker poles in the snow) and information provided about the edge of this slope were all consistent with French standards in place.'

He said the rock that caused him to lose balance and the rock on which he struck his head 'are 10.40 metres from each other and both are located at 4.50 metres from the boundary of the piste'.

His decision does not, however, prevent Schumacher’s family from taking civil action.
