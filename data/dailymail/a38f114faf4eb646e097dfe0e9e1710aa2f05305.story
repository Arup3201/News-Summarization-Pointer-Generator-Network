Jean-Marc Hodgkin has been warned he faces a jail sentence after ploughing his horsebox into a pensioner

A City high-flyer is facing jail tonight after he was found guilty of ploughing his horsebox into a pensioner and left him pinned to his bonnet.

Ex-London Stock Exchange boss Jean-Marc Hodgkin was convicted of dangerous driving today following the incident that left Michael Parker, 74, with severe leg injuries.

He was cleared of the more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Parker.

Judge Gordon Risius today said he could not rule out a prison sentence for Mr Hodgkin after the jury delivered their verdict.

The father-of-two was told he will definitely be banned from driving.

Judge Risius said: 'I think that given the importance of getting the right sentence the proper course would be for me to adjourn for a pre-sentence report so I can ensure that all the options are properly covered.

'The fact I’m adjourning indicates that custody is a possibility but equally there are alternatives.'

Polo-playing Hodgkin, who wore a pinstriped suit and red tie, was emotionless when the verdict was read out at Oxford Crown Court after four hours and 25 minutes of jury deliberation. 

The jury had been told that Hodgkin had become furious after Mr Parker reversed his green Land Rover Discovery from the middle of a 30mph road into his driveway on August 4 last year.

Hodgkin, who had three of his polo horses and 250 litres of water in his Mercedes vehicle, was then forced to brake and stop just yards from Mr Parker’s vehicle near a dipped kerb.

An argument erupted between the pair, 
with Hodgkin allegedly calling Michael Parker a ‘cretin’, 
‘country bumpkin’ and a ‘f****** idiot’.

Mr Parker admitted that he also
used foul language before he was struck after getting out of his car.

Hodgkin, who had his 15-year-old daughter in the car, was accused of swinging his vehicle and three of his prized polo horses in the Mercedes, to the left - trapping Mr Parker on the bonnet of the Land Rover.

He then drove off from the A418 Aylesbury Road, Bierton, near Aylesbury, Bucks., leaving the pensioner on the ground with severe leg injuries, the court was told.

Passing motorists stopped 
to assist the pensioner, who sustained a deep cut to his leg, a 
dislocated knee requiring an operation and damage to ligaments and 
muscles.

Prosecutor Sandra Beck previously told the jury the impact of the 
pinning motion had bent the front grill of Mr 
Parker’s Land Rover towards the passenger side.

'That impact caused a
very serious injury - a dislocated knee requiring an operation with 
ligament and muscular injury,' she had said during the trial.

Hodgkin, who has worked for KPMG and served on the board of trustees at two schools in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, maintained that he had not deliberately driven into the pensioner.

Hodgkin previously said he was 'shocked, confused and upset' when police told him about Mr Parker's injuries.

He said: 'I think it was a horrible accident. It was an accident I didn’t know about at the time.'

He will be sentenced on September 30 and has been banned from driving until that date.

Mr Parker, who walks with a stick, 
told the court during the trial: ‘There was a verbal confrontation. The words were 
grossly unpleasant. Four-letter words were involved.

'It ended in the 
defendant giving it (the horsebox) one full blast of the throttle and 
swung towards me quite violently.’

The defendant, who regularly played 
polo at West Wycombe Park, Buckinghamshire, described his confrontation 
with Mr Parker.

He said: ‘I was getting illogical nonsensical answers so
I said ‘‘mate, you’re an idiot’’. Unfortunately that inflamed Mr Parker
and he started swearing back at me. I resolved to drive off.’

He said it was not an incident which lingered in his mind until 20 minutes later when police stopped him.

‘I said, ‘‘Is this because I shouted 
at the old man?’’ They just told me there had been an accident and a man
was injured. I felt sick and confused and frightened because I hadn’t 
been aware of an incident even.’
