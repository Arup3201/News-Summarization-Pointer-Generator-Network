This is the incredible moment brave brain tumour patient Ashya King took his first steps on the road to recovery after his parents' long battle for pioneering therapy.

Five-year-old Ashya managed to raise his arm and give a wave as he was helped by his mother Naghmeh, 45, and father Brett, 51, down a hospital corridor in Prague, Czech Republic.

The youngster, who was at the centre of an international manhunt after his parents took him out of Southampton General Hospital because they believed NHS treatment would have left him deaf, blind and brain damaged, has just finished his final session of proton therapy treatment.

Loving: Ashya King, five, managed to raise his arm and give a wave as he was helped by his mother Naghmeh, 45, and father Brett, 51, down a hospital corridor in Prague, Czech Republic, following the last of his treatment

Recovery: After taking his first tentative steps, Ashya was wheeled out of the specialist centre ahead of his family's move to Spain. The youngster has spent six weeks receiving pioneering proton therapy treatment

He has spent the last six weeks at the Czech Proton Therapy Centre where he has received 30 sessions of the pioneering treatment which his parents hope will be life-saving.

As he took to his feet for the first time since after being struck down with a brain tumour, Ashya gave a wave to the camera and managed a slight grin.

His father, who smiled broadly as he lovingly held his son under the arms as he attempted his first tentative steps, said it was great to see his condition improving.

'It really is amazing how much he has come on,' he told The Sunday Mirror.

The youngster was later seen waving from his wheelchair as he left the Proton Therapy Centre following the end of his treatment on Friday.

The Kings sparked an international manhunt when they took Ashya from Southampton General Hospital without seeking doctors' permission in August.

They were traced to Spain where, at the request of the British authorities, they were put in prison and the five-year-old was held in hospital under armed guard with no family allowed to see him.

Care: Paramedics lifted the five-year-old into an ambulance ahead of the family's plan to travel to Spain

The Kings had planned to sell a holiday home in southern Spain to fund the pioneering treatment which they desperately wanted their son to have, but which was refused by the NHS in England.

However, after a dramatic U-turn in events, they were eventually released from prison without charge and were able to continue their journey to Prague to the Proton Therapy Centre which agreed to treat Ashya.

NHS England later reversed its decision and confirmed it had decided to pay for the treatment abroad afterall.

Despite Ashya's treatment coming to an end in the Czech capital, Mr King said it was unlikely the family would return to Britain because they do not feel 'safe' enough.

Fears: Mr King said they are worried the authorities will take Ashya from them if they return to the UK

Instead, they plan to continue Ashya's treatment in Spain.

Mr King said: 'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe contemplating being in England.

'There is so much still at stake. We wouldn't want to lose Ashya. It would probably never happen but just having that small risk that you don't have to do anything wrong to have your children taken away and be thrown in prison'.

He added to Sky News: 'After some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to Spain.

We have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us.

'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe, I suppose you would call it, contemplating being in England until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us.

'Once that has been established then we can think about going back to England. But for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in Spain so we are continuing with (Ashya's) treatment in Spain instead of England.'

Earlier this week, Iva Tatounova from the Proton Therapy Clinic told Sky News: 'We always thought Ashya would benefit from the specialist treatment here at the PTC.

'And whilst he is still not fully recovered, he's responded very well to the proton beam therapy and there is no reason that he will not continue to get stronger once he leaves here.

Happy: Ashya was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted online by his brother

'I don't know if you remember the pictures when he was transported here - just lying on his bed in the ambulance.

'Now he can sit on his own, he can play with the toys and his motorics improved dramatically. He can also react to his surroundings.'

The specialist treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams, but NHS guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment.

During Ashya's 30 visits to the centre, he had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine, to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread, and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was.

He previously had major surgery to remove the brain tumour on July 24 and a further operation on his brain on August 22.
