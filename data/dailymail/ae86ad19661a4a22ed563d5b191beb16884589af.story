Chelsea powerhouse Nemanja Matic hasn't lost a game for his club since April and heads into the new year threatening to be the Premier League's most dominant player of 2015.

While Jose Mourinho's men lost their chance of emulating Arsenal's unbeaten season when they were beaten at Newcastle United, they still have an Invincible in their midst in Matic.

The 26-year-old Serbia midfielder – strong, powerful, tactically and technically excellent and hailed as a 'giant' by Mourinho – proudly boasts a personal record of 23 wins and seven draws in his last 30 games for the club in all competitions.

And as Chelsea chase an unprecedented quadruple, something even Mourinho hasn't managed before, Matic is the player he can least afford to lose, including John Terry, Eden Hazard and Diego Costa.

Lest we forget, Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League, in the last 16 of the Champions League, semi-finals of the Capital One Cup, and the FA Cup is about to start.

'It is possible. We are all ready to play in every moment,' insists Matic, and if they pull it off, he would be a shoo-in for Footballer of the Year.

It is no coincidence he was out with suspension when Chelsea crashed 2-1 at Newcastle at the start of December to lose their own unbeaten run. It is the only time since mid-September Chelsea have conceded more than one goal in the game.

As they prepare for their first test of 2015 at Spurs on New Year's Day, he is the player who separates Chelsea from the rest. Their rivals boast such glittering names as Alexis Sanchez, Wayne Rooney and Raheem Sterling but where Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool miss out is the lack of a truly world-class holding midfield player. 

Manchester City have the closest thing to Matic in Brazilian midfielder Fernando, which is why it's no coincidence they are next best to Chelsea in the table.

Jose Mourinho has hailed his central defensive midfielder as a 'giant' - he is a 6ft 4in wall of steel 

Mourinho says of his 6ft 4in wall of steel: 'He's a giant. Not for his size, but for the way he plays. He is a giant.'

The eye-catching £26million paid to Benfica to bring Matic back to the Bridge in January now looks a bargain.

Players are normally physically or technically excellent. Matic is both, combining outstanding power and a calmness on the ball that allows him and Cesc Fabregas to be the launchpad for so many Chelsea attacks.

Intriguingly, it has taken more than five years for Matic to become an overnight success in England.

He originally signed for Chelsea as a 20-year-old in the summer of 2009, his official start date coming exactly a month after the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti as manager.

Had Middlesbrough been quicker off the mark, they would have got him first. He spent a week on trial at the Riverside after Boro had been tipped off by the manager of his Slovakian club Kosice, Allen Bula, but the Teessiders never followed it up.

Instead, the £1.1m paid by Chelsea to Kosice looked money well spent when Matic's first three appearances for Chelsea ended in wins by 4-0, 5-0 and 8-0.

But after a season on loan to Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem to gain first-team experience, the midfielder was surprisingly sold to Benfica in the summer of 2011.

Even though the £21m transfer fee represented a tidy profit for Chelsea, the absence of a Matic-type player in midfield was felt as Roman Abramovich tried to build a new attacking Chelsea around the likes of Hazard and Oscar.

The experiment with Andre Villas-Boas didn't work and Roberto Di Matteo and Rafa Benitez's stints were always going to be brief given Abramovich's uncertainty towards RDM and the hostility of the Stamford Bridge crowd to Benitez.

When Mourinho arrived back in 2013, he realised halfway through his first season that Chelsea were too flimsy. Out went Juan Mata to Manchester United for £38m in the January transfer window in 2014 and back in came Matic, at an increased price

Chelsea had been able to keep a direct watch on the left-footer while he had been in Portugal. Matic played for Benfica against the Blues in the 2012 Champions League quarter-finals, which the English club won 3-1 on aggregate, and the Europa League final the following year, which Chelsea won 2-1.

Back at the Bridge, Matic impressed towards the tail-end of last season but it's been this campaign where he has excelled.

After an uncharacteristically loose start to the season for a Mourinho team, including a 6-3 victory against Everton, Chelsea have become masters of the clean sheet again.

Going forward, he is also a threat, mainly through his passing but also when he decides to unpack his fierce shot or show his aerial ability at set-pieces.

Two of his three goals have come in the Champions League – in which Chelsea qualified with ease – including a header on his return to Portugal when Chelsea won 1-0 in Sporting Lisbon.

Perhaps his stand-out display came in a hard-fought 2-1 win at Liverpool in November. He was voted man of the match at Anfield as Chelsea resisted a strong performance from Brendan Rodgers' side.

Matic didn't misplace a pass and even gave the team talk before the game. 'It was very inspiring,' said skipper John Terry. 'He is a real player for the team. He has been the heart of our performances week-in, week-out.'

With Mourinho currently in a paranoid state about a 'campaign' against Chelsea, he will probably remember having Fernando Torres sent off at White Hart Lane season by referee Mike Dean.

Still, with Matic in the side, you wouldn't put money on Chelsea losing their opening game of 2015 or many beyond that.
