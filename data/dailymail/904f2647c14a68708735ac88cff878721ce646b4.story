He was jailed in 2006 after pleading guilty to dangerous driving.

On 2 May 2005 Hamed was involved in a 90-mph three-car collision at Ringinglow Road, Sheffield, while driving his £300,000 silver McLaren-Mercedes SLR.

Sheffield Crown Court heard that Hamed had been anxious to impress businessman Asif Goro, who was a passenger in the McLaren-Mercedes at the time of the crash, when he crossed a solid white line at a speed of at least 90 mph and crashed head-on into a Volkswagen Golf that emerged from a dip in the road.

Hamed leaves Moorlands Open Prison after serving just 16 weeks of a 15-month sentence for dangerous driving. He seriously injured a 38-year-old man in a high-speed head-on collision 

Hamed's car then hit a second vehicle, the Ford Mondeo he had been trying to overtake.

Anthony Burgin, the 38-year-old driver of the Volkswagen Golf, was very seriously injured, breaking every major bone in his body and suffering bruising to the brain.

Hamed, who escaped the crash unhurt, was sentenced for 15 months in prison, of which he served 16 weeks, and given a four-year driving ban.

There was also a civil court case rumoured to cost Hamed, who was also stripped of his MBE, up to £1 million plus legal costs, as Mr Burgin was deemed unable ever to work again.
