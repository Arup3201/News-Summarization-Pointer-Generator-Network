There are 44,000 male escorts working in the UK but when former glamour model Jodie Marsh tried to interview the British women who hire them for a new documentary, she couldn't find one who would be willing to speak to her.

But she found the situation was completely different in the U.S. where women were more open about their desire for casual sex and their willingness to hire an escort to satisfy their needs.

One of the women Jodie met for her TLC show, Jodie Marsh On Women Who Pay For Sex, which airs this evening, is Cyndi, 46, from Miami.

Cyndi, 46, from Miami, hit it off with male escort Dom who she hired to go on a date with her

She told Jodie that she was willing to pay $2,500 (£1,700) for a date with her 'dream man' following the end of her 15-year marriage.

The mother said: 'I am finding men my age haven't taken care of themselves that well, I like younger men.'

On why she chose to hire a younger man to date rather than seek to meet someone on a dating site or through friends, Cyndi admitted it was because she just wanted to have fun and keep things casual.

She said: 'I want to get out of the daily grind of my life. It's hard for women to admit we don't want strings either, we feel an obligation to want more from it.

'It's hard to admit to your friends you just want casual sex and a really fun night and not have anything more come of it.'

Jodie, right, meets the pair who revealed their date led to a one night stand 

Cyndi hired male escort Dom, a father in a long-term relationship, to go on a date with her to a yoga class followed by drinks and dinner.

But Jodie discovered they clicked so well, they stayed the night at a hotel where they had sex.

Male escorts legally can't advertise sex for money and websites are carefully worded so women know they are not buying sex but companionship.

However, as Cyndi discovered, 'extras' are often on offer if both parties are agreeable.

Appearing on today's This Morning with Jodie, Cyndi told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that sex wasn't top of her agenda when she first hired Dom, a 6ft 3 ex-marine.

She explained: 'Hiring a male escort was something I was curious about after getting divorced. It served my needs without getting serious. I thought of it as a fun adventure.

'I had an open mind but didn't think it would definitely lead to sex. I thought it would be good experience and chance to hang out with good looking man who paid attention to me.

Cyndi appeared on This Morning today via video link as Amanda Holden, left, asked her why she hired a male escort and Jodie, right, revealed they couldn't get a British woman to admit the same

'Dominic he said he thought I was beautiful and was happy I was there. I suppose he was paid to say that but it felt really genuine.' 

After spending the night with Dom - whose girlfriend condones his employment - Cyndi told Jodie she would hire him again and would recommend other women do the same if they want a pleasurable night with no strings attached.

Jodie told Phillip and Amanda she was concerned about how Cyndi would emotionally handle the one night stand she paid for.

She said: 'She definitely had a real connection with him and I was worried she could fall for him as they clicked so much and had such a great time.'

Jodie, 36, is currently celibate and said on today's This Morning she would hire a male escort to join her at a party rather than attending as 'an older single woman on my own'

But Cyndi insisted on This Morning that she knew what she had signed up for.

'In this experience I could separate my emotions as I knew what I was involved with, it was what it was,' she said.

'We are humans and I thought he was adorable and sweet and we had a physical connection and chemistry but I wasn't going to let my heart get involved.

'I wasn't hiring him to fall in love and have kids with him. I would do it again and absolutely recommend other women do it if the situation is right and you are emotionally in control of your feelings.'

Jodie, 36, agreed that she would also hire a male escort to accompany her on dates - but as she's been celibate for the past four years there would be nothing sexual involved.

Jodie had to travel to America to interview women who have paid for sex with male escorts as none in Britain were willing to be open about it

On Jodie's TLC show, she also meets male strippers, pictured, as well as gigolos and the women who are forgoing dating and relationships for an evening with a professional lover

She said: 'I have hired an escort before and I would use one again if I was going to a party rather being an older single woman on my own.

'Women feel threatened by other single women so if you are there with a fella people don't see you as a threat.'

The TV presenter, who has also had success as a body builder, said she wasn't surprised she had to travel to America to research her latest documentary after finding nobody in Britain willing to admit they hire male escorts.   

She said: 'Not a single woman admitted to using them! We met so many of British male escorts and they really love their job.

'British people are not just reserved, they just do not want to speak openly about anything.'

Jodie Marsh On Women Who Pay For Sex is on TLC tonight at 10pm
