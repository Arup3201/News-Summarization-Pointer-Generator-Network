Controversial Benefits Street star White Dee is undergoing training in France as she prepares to become a celebrity chef in her own £20,000 cookery series. 

The 42-year-old self styled 'dole queen' is currently in Saint-Paul-le-Gaultier, France, where she is working under a 'top chef' at the Chez Maebro bistro in the town as her agent pushes for her to become the 'next Rustie Lee'.

After days of intense tutelage at the cafe - which offers chips, pizzas, and special kebab platters alongside traditional French fare - she will tonight serve up a three course meal to diners celebrating a private 80th birthday party.

The bistro in the small town in North Western France is popular with Brits and also regularly holds curry evenings. The bar last night hosted a Led Zeppelin tribute band for its mainly ex-pat customers.

Her agent Barry Tomes last month revealed that Dee had been offered her own TV cookery show - which will follow her teaching Brits how to cook on a tight budget.

The show - if given the go ahead - could land her £20,000 for a six episode run, he said.

Mr Tomes said the visit will be Dee's first turn in a professional kitchen ahead of her bid to become the 'next Rustie Lee' and that she had been hard at work perfecting courses of fish soup and moules frites for tonight.

TV chef Rustie became famous for her loud and outgoing style on her appearances in the 1980s breakfast show TV-am, and later had her own cooking programme.

Mr Tomes said the mother-of-two loves 
to cook fresh fish while at home and insists on serving fruit and 
vegetables to her children with every meal.

He said: 'She is very strict with them about that.

'To be honest with you she is a fantastic chef and doesn't really need the training, but I thought it would be a good idea ahead of the TV show.

'Cooking for five people at home is very different to cooking for 30 people in a restaurant.'

The Birmingham mother-of-two, who is rumoured to have had 
some of her benefits frozen after it emerged she was being paid to do 
promotional work, has been receiving around £20,000 a year in welfare 
payments.

The single mother angered taxpayers after insisting she would continue claiming handouts until the Government stops her.

Last month it was also reported she had turned down four job opportunities, claiming they were 'too boring' among other excuses.

After
 being given trial runs at four potential careers near her home in 
Birmingham, she declined to pursue any of them.

She 
is reported to be receiving £214 a week from a combination of Employment
 and Support Allowance - formerly known as incapacity benefit - child 
tax credit and child benefit, plus £500 a month in housing benefit.

Miss
 Kelly said she does feel guilty about claiming handouts, maintaining it
 is her depression that has stopped her from taking on full-time roles.

A decision on whether her benefits will be withdrawn is expected to be announced in July.

Mr Tomes aid that the DWP had requested an earlier meeting with Ms Kelly, but that she was unable to make it as it coincided with a public appearance at a pool party in Magaluf later this month.
