Like many women, I buy clothes because I like the way they look on skinny models in fashion magazines. But unlike them I am 43, a size 12 and mother of two children, so I’ve also learned to try to disguise my problem areas.

I know my husband would rather see me in tight dresses but I prefer floaty clothes which are a size too big for me and hide a multitude of sins. Or do they?

Mail fashion editor Eliza Scarborough took four wardrobe staples to show how the right outfit can make me look a stone lighter, and the wrong one a stone heavier...

FATTENING, PLEATED MAXI DRESS: I feel like a Greek goddess in this halterneck maxi dress, but when I really look at my reflection, I realise that, sadly, I don’t resemble one.

It looks as if my head is poking out of the top of a festival tent - there’s room for my whole family in here - and the halterneck that I believed was a failsafe flatterer makes my shoulders look broad. I thought the loose shape would skim over my physique, but without a belt it makes me look shapeless.

Perhaps if I were in my 20s, with toned, slender arms, I might be able to carry off this dress. As it is, I just look as though I have rather a lot to hide. I’ve easily gained a stone just by putting this on. SLIMMING, ILLUSION PANEL DRESS: When even supermodels like Kate Moss and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wear illusion dresses to enhance their perfectly proportioned physiques, it would seem sensible to take notice.

But I’ve never liked these dresses: they look a bit comical, somehow, and surely the optical illusion is too obvious to fool anyone?

But when Eliza finally convinces me to try this on, I really like it.  It’s not too tight or revealing, but it is alluring, though a little too obviously sexy for my taste.

Importantly though, the dark panels at the sides definitely make me look thinner. A stone seems to have instantly vanished.

FATTENING, HORIZONTAL STRIPES: I adore horizontal stripes. I own at least five Breton tops and a horizontal-striped dress, so I love this graphic tunic as soon as I see it.

It’s fun and funky, and I think the straight shape is elegant and youthful. But once I’ve put it on, as Eliza gently helps me see, I realise that I look like a giant bee or a zebra crossing.

The horizontal stripes make me look so much wider, while the dress hangs unflatteringly from my shoulders, with no hint of a waist underneath.

Based on what I’ve seen today, I fear my beloved stripy tops may have to go!

SLIMMING, DIAGONAL STRIPES: I can see the appeal of this pretty striped dress to other women, but I’d never have considered it for myself.

It’s not just the lack of sleeves or the plunging neckline that would have put me off; it’s the whole Fifties style, which I never imagined could suit me.

I’ve always been athletic rather than curvy, so I thought looser styles were more flattering for my shape. To my surprise, I found the nipped-in waist and diagonal stripes drew the eye and gave me the hourglass shape I’ve never had. I look so much slimmer! The diagonal stripes are definitely a trick I’d try again.

Fattening: Left, top, £30, and linen trousers, £39, hobbs.co.uk. Sandals, £85.50, and clutch, £255, russellandbromley.co.uk.

Slimming: right, green peplum top, £35, jaeger.co.uk. Blue bow belt, £29,hobbs.co.uk. Navy slim-leg trousers, £89, reiss.com

FATTENING, PASTELS: Like strawberries and cream, the combination of white linen trousers and a mint-green linen top seems perfect for a summer’s day. On the hanger, both items exude casual elegance.

But once  on, the baggy trousers swamp me, and the drawstring waist doesn’t help at all. While a tighter top may work better, this floppy number makes me look big.

This is an especially galling realisation as I have a pair of almost identical trousers at home, which I wear with a linen shirt. The outfit may have to go.

SLIMMING, DARK, BOLD COLOURS: These trousers are a hit: dark blue, body skimming and stretchy, they streamline my legs beautifully.

I’m wary of the top - I don’t like the colour or the lack of sleeves - but once I get it on, I realise that I’ve got it horribly wrong again, and Eliza has got it absolutely right.

The peplum actually makes my waist look narrower - an effect which is enhanced by the skinny belt. I would never have chosen this outfit myself, but I have to admit I really like it.

FATTENING, PLEATS: A pleated mid-length skirt teamed with a jacket and high heels is my failsafe choice for summer weddings and smart events. But looking at this picture, I’m going to have to rethink that. The pleats on the skirt add extra bulk to my hips, while the length cuts off my calves at their widest point. And looking at it carefully, I realise my usual choice of a boxy jacket is stiff. It hangs straight from my shoulders and skims my waist, making me look square.

Regardless, it’s more comfortable - and classier - than the ‘slimming’ skirt. I think I’ll chance the extra stone.

SLIMMING, TIGHT AND HIGH-WAISTED: While I like the sexy secretary look on other women - Joan from Mad Men springs to mind - I never thought I could carry it off myself.

This tight, high-waisted skirt looks as though it would cling to every lump and bump, while the draped top is too revealing for my tastes. But once I’ve wriggled into it, the slimline skirt does make me look leaner and several inches taller.

And while I’d feel more relaxed with the addition of a jacket, the wrap top is less revealing than I’d feared. This look just isn’t me, though. I may look slimmer, but I don’t feel comfortable.

I’ve spent years swamping myself in clothes that are too big for me, thinking they make me look slimmer. Now, rather late in the day, I realise that showing off my body — with all its imperfections — is wiser and more flattering. Forget the diet - losing a stone was simple with a few clever wardrobe tweaks. I’m amazed by what this experiment has taught me - but nobody else seems to be!

‘I’ve always hated you in linen,’ my mother tells me. ‘It makes you look so much larger than you are.’ (Why she hasn’t said anything for 43 years is beyond me.)

My husband, of course, is delighted, and dives eagerly into my wardrobe in search of the items he detests most. He quickly amasses a huge reject pile in the middle of the bedroom floor: on it, a beloved floaty, full-length blue cotton skirt, linen trousers, the stripy dress and a waistless green satin shirt I’ve just bought in the sales. ‘You can dump anything sludge-coloured too!’ he continues gleefully, adding several beige and cream T-shirts to the heap.

Eventually, all I have left are a couple of figure-hugging dresses, a pair of skinny jeans and my best suit. Time for some serious shopping, but only if I can take Eliza with me.
