Halle Berry was photographed heading to court today to ask a judge for an order prohibiting her ex boyfriend from having any contact with their daughter.

She wanted Gabriel Aubry to be kept away from their 3-year-old while he is being investigated for child endangerment.

The actress, who looked strained, was driven to the LA courthouse by her lawyer.

But Halle has been told she will have to wait until Monday to get a decision.

Another legal battle: Halle Berry was seen heading to court today where she is expected to ask a judge to prohibit Gabriel Aubry from seeing their daughter

Judge Scott Gordon heard the matter this morning while Judge Mark Juhas, who has been handling the ongoing custody case, is on vacation, according to TMZ.Â 

Accused: It has been claimed Gabriel Aubry was verbally and physically abusive to Nahla's nany

After
hearing the lawyers arguments, Judge Gordon decided to put the matter off until next Monday, when Judge 
Juhas returns.

Judge Gordon did not grant an immediate emergency 
order for either side because he believed there are enough protections 
in place to keep Nahla safe until Monday's hearing.

Halle and Gabriel did not address the judge.

The French-Canadian model is accused 
of pushing the nanny of his three-year-old daughter Nahla - who he had 
with ex-girlfriend Halle Berry - into a door while she was holding the 
little girl.

The caregiver, Alliance Kamdem, had requested a restraining order against Aubry claiming she feared retaliation.

But today the judge also rejected 
Kamdem's request for a restraining order, calling her petition 
'insufficient and speculative.'The judge added that Kamdem's issues should be resolved in family court.

Sources have said that the alleged incident took place when Gabriel was supposed to take Nahla to school on Wednesday but kept her home instead.

When
nanny Alliance Kamden arrived to pick her up and found her not to beat at school , she went to Gabriel's home and questioned him as to why he had 
kept her away from school.

According
to a report, Gabriel shouted: 'You're the f**king nanny. Who do you 
think you are? You are a nobody. You don't need to f**king know 
anything.'

Legal documents: Alliance Kamden's statement in petition for a restraining order against Gabriel

Claims: The nanny has documented several incidents she claimed happened between her and Nahla's father

Not enough: The request for a restraining order was rejected but the nanny is free to pursue criminal charges

Caught in the middle: Little Nahla was seen being taking to school while her parents were in court

He then pushed her out of the door while she was carrying Nahla, and she went to the police claiming she had been injured.

The investigation is being listed as 'battery' but the source adds child endangerment is also 'definitely' being investigated.

Alliance has now quit as the nanny of the child, and Gabriel's representative has slammed the case.

His spokesperson said: 'Anyone can file a police report at any time, regardless of it being accurate.'

It is the latest development in the long-running legal battle between the pair over their daughter.

The nanny has been a bone of contention previously, with the model failing in an attempt in October to have more visitation time with his daughter without her supervision.

He is furious at not being allowed to care for his daughter on his own, and claims the chidlminder encroaches on his relationship with Nahla.

The Mail contacted Gabriel and Halle's legal representatives, but have yet to receive a response.
