A Nazi surgical equipment set owned by an SS commandant and war criminal has been withdrawn from a sale today after phone and e-mail threats.

The wooden box of tools
belonged to Anton Burger, a major in the SS who worked at the 
Theresienstadt concentration camp between July 1943 and February 1944, 
where 140,000 Jews were held  -  and 33,000 of them died.

The set had been due to go under the hammer at Villa Hall Auctions in Bude, Cornwall, tomorrow.

The wooden box of tools belonged to Anton Burger, a major in the SS who oversaw the Theresienstadt concentration camp between July 1943 and February 1944

Disturbingly, given the contents of the box, there is no evidence that Sturmbannfuhrer Burger ever received medical training. A separate layer above the forked hooks reveals a sinister set of scissors

The case is marked 'instrumente gemischte', German for 'mixed instruments'. This has led to the theory it may have been part of the deception to fool the Red Cross into thinking it was for musical instruments

Austrian-born Burger was sentenced to death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name, eventually dying in Germany in 1991 at the age of 80

The police said the messages prompted 
safety concerns for staff and there will be a police presence at the 
auction even though the controversial lot has been withdrawn.

The set contains instruments that would have been used in amputations including a saw and scalpels.

It belonged to a late Jewish man whose
wife is the current owner. The man's own parents survived the camp 
where they were held and married.

Grace Cloke, partner at the Bude 
auction house, said: 'We've had phone calls and e mails which were not 
of a particular nice nature.

'Some were pretty threatening and the 
police were concerned that an activist group might turn up. Some of the 
contact was from people who had lost family members during the war and 
were not happy with the auction.

'But there were a few that were really unpleasant. One said "I hope you die of cancer".

'It's shame as our vendor was going to
donate the money to the War Child charity. None of us felt particularly
comfortable about the sale but the money was going to a good cause.'

The set had a guide price of £2,000 and it had been hoped a museum would have bought it.

News of the sale provoked outrage in 
the Jewish community. Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of 
Deputies, the main representative body of British Jews, said that 'to 
seek to profit from such ghoulish objects is deeply troubling'.

Other
Jewish groups, including the Anne Frank Trust and Holocaust Educational
Trust, said that the collection should be placed in an educational 
context, such as a museum.

Theresienstadt was used as a 
propaganda tool during the Second World War, with the Germans trying to 
fool the world that it was a 'paradise camp'.

Theresienstadt, near what is now the town of Terezin in the Czech Republic, acted as a ghetto for 140,000 Jews, with 33,000 dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as Auschwitz and murdered

Gillian
Walnes, executive director of the Anne Frank Trust UK

'Inexplicably there are those who
have a grotesque fascination with Nazi memorabilia and instruments used to
inflict suffering on innocent adults and children. 

'I
therefore hope that this item will be acquired by a respected museum or
academic institution that will use it for educational purposes.'

Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies

'There
is understandably a continuing fascination with this tragic part of our recent
history, and along with the countless books and films on the subject, from time
to time artefacts emerge that testify to the horrors of the Holocaust. 

'These things serve to remind us of the terrible events that happened, and
incontrovertibly show the claims of Holocaust deniers for the lies that they
are. 

'However, to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects, and to risk
that they might fall into the hands of admirers of the Nazis, is deeply
troubling. A more fitting home would be in a museum or suitable historical
archive somewhere.'

Karen Pollock, chief executive
of the Holocaust Educational Trust

'Wherever possible we believe
Holocaust-era items should be presented in an educational context, so that as
many people as possible can learn about what took place during that appalling
time.'

They even made a film showing happy 
workers shoeing horses and making handbags, while children played 
football or ate sandwiches to add to the deception.

Burger played a key role in covering 
up the true horrors of the camp during stage-managed visits by the Red 
Cross - which were used to
help conceal the sickening purpose behind it and other camps from the 
watching
world.

Disturbingly, given the contents of the
box, there is no evidence that Sturmbannfuhrer Burger ever received medical training.

The mostly monogrammed equipment was put up for sale by an anonymous
seller.

Before the withdrawal, Ms Cloke explained that the husband of the vendor
was Jewish, and his parents met and married at a concentration camp in Austria.

Ms Cloke said: 'This set was always in
their home while they were married. 

'He wouldn't talk about his history but he
used to spend a lot of time researching the Second World War.'

The vendor's husband passed away
some years ago and she lost contact with his family so she still does not know
how he came to own the instruments.

Ms Cloke added: 'The father [of the vendor's husband] used to deal during the war in the black market so we don't
know whether they were in the camp and were able to take it or whether it came
through the black market somehow,' she said.

'It is something we are never going
to know.'

The camp, near what is now the town of
Terezin in the Czech Republic, acted as a ghetto for 140,000 Jews, with 33,000
dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as
Auschwitz and murdered.

Just 1,900 were still alive when the
ghetto was liberated by Soviet troops on May 7, 1945.

Burger was ordered by SS leader Heinrich
Himmler and Adolf Eichmann, the orchestrator of the mass movement of Jews to camps
in Eastern Europe, to change the appearance of Theresienstadt to fool Red Cross
members who had requested access to a Nazi concentration camp.

Many inmates were temporarily removed from
the overcrowded camp and cosmetic changes made to fool the inspectors.

Fake shops and cafes were erected to give the
false impression that inmates had a life of relative comfort.

The Red Cross representatives seemed to
fall for the deception and the Nazis went on to make a propaganda film at the
camp.

The fact that the wooden instrument case
is marked 'instrumente gemischte', German for 'mixed
instruments', has led to the theory that this may have been made as part
of the deception, to suggest it was for musical instruments.

'Anton Burger was charged with
changing the appearance of the camp, and a lot of the Jews there were musical
so it is possible it was made to look like a musical instrument case,' Ms
Cloke said.

Austrian-born Burger was sentenced to
death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name, eventually dying
in Germany in 1991 at the age of 80.

It was only three years after his death,
in 1994, that anyone found out who the dead man really was.

Museums and other institutions showed an interest in the sale and Ms Cloke said they hoped
it would go to an organisation that would be able to use it in a positive,
educational setting.
