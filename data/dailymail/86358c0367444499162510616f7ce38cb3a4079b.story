It's something that feminists may find hard to stomach.

When it comes to getting on in life, laying on a little female charm can go a long way, a survey suggests.

More than half of British women admit to flirting with men to get their own way, with a fifth saying they do so at work.

Thirty per cent of the female respondents even said they used sex as a ‘reward’ for good treatment from their partner or husband.

The poll of 2,000 people found that 39 per cent of male managers admitted to employing a female candidate based on their level of attractiveness.

Almost half of those men said they had gone on to have a relationship with someone they had employed.

Almost three in five employers – 57 per cent – said they gave preferential treatment to attractive employees.

And when asked ‘Are you more likely to give way to an attractive motorist?’ 42 per cent of men replied ‘yes’ – in comparison with 16 per cent of women.

The survey was commissioned by comparison website Confused.com which said it wanted to investigate gender bias and positive discrimination.

Sharon Flaherty, head of PR at the  company, said: ‘So much focus nowadays is placed on how women can be seen as equals in the workplace without gender coming into play.

‘But our results show that despite this, many women will turn to their feminine wiles to help themselves get ahead, should the situation call for it.

‘Whether or not this is a good or bad thing is entirely subjective, but it seems that many women aren’t afraid to turn to gender at some point or another as a means of benefit, whether it be to flirt their way out of trouble or bag a promotion.’
