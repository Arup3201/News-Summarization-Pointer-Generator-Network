She's the 'property concierge' who claims she can't find enough upmarket Australian real estate to keep up with demand from her wealthy Chinese clients.

Monika Tu is the head of Sydney-based real estate firm Black Diamondz, which rakes in business from Chinese business people with cash to burn, the ABC's 7.30 reports.

'I am dealing with high net worth foreign buyers and we specialise in luxury properties. Almost 100 percent are established properties,' she said.

Ms Tu, who started the company with her husband Jad Khattar in 2009, boasts of surpassing her ambitious sale targets annually.

'My target was $100 million I remember, and I have reached now about $120 million,' Ms Tu said. 

She has already set next year's sale goal to $200 million.

An Australian parliamentary committee recommended strengthening rules on foreign investment on Thursday, including fines for those who buy property illegally.

Currently, foreign investors can purchase new properties in Australia but there are certain restrictions on selling established homes. 

The parliamentary review was commissioned earlier this year following concerns buyers were being pushed out of the market by wealth foreign investors.

Ms Tu told 7.30 she didn't believe the strengthening rules would have an effect on her cashed-up clients. 

'There are a lot of rules, and first of all they have to have a visa, they have to be a resident here and they will be able to buy,' she said.

'The majority have a significant investor visa... I think you have to invest a certain amount of money like, probably, $5 million into a business or management funds, and that is how they qualify for the visa.'
