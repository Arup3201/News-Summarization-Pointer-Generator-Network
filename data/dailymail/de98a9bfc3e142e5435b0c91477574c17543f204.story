A Chinese woman's eye was gouged out by her husband after he discovered she was in a new relationship and wanted a divorce, it has been reported.

The 39-year-old woman, surnamed Li, from Yulin city in Guangxi met her second husband, surnamed Long, on the internet in November last year after the end of her first marriage, reports the Nanguo Morning News.

For the first three months the relationship went well as they had a lot in common and the man, from south-central China's Hunan province, did whatever she asked.

However, he suddenly became violent after asking Li to help pay half of the 150,000 yuan (Â£15,000) debt that his family owed for their pig business. Li refused and Long allegedly stripped off her clothes and beat her.

She tried to leave him but Long hid her ID card and threatened to harm her family if she did.

Li was later forced into marrying him after weeks of intimidation. The man continued to beat her and also hid their marriage certificate.

On one occasion Long was cautioned by police after he attacked his wife in public near the train station in the regional capital Guilin.

After suffering months of abuse, Li escaped and returned to Yulin at the end of September and started seeing another man after being introduced to him by a friend.

But on December 13, Long showed up at her rented house unexpectedly and attacked her boyfriend. Li tried to stop Long but he turned on her, struck her repeatedly and then gouged out her left eye with his fingers.

Afterwards, Long got her to a hospital and then called the police to turn himself in. He has been in custody since Tuesday, the paper reported.

Li has lost her eye as a result of the attack. She said she was scared of her husband but had few options because he had hidden all of her identification documents. She also called on women's rights groups or legal institutions to help her in her plight.
