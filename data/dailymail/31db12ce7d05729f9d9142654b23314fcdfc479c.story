Paint giant Dulux has been forced to pay out thousands of pounds in compensation to disgruntled DIY-ers who claimed its ‘brilliant white’ paint is neither brilliant nor white - because it fades to yellow.

Customers complained the company’s oil-based paint turns a creamy yellow colour over time - often within weeks of application.

Dulux has admitted the problem was caused by new EU regulations which forced it to water down solvent levels in the paint.

But customers left with yellow walls are furious they weren't warned about of the problem before they invested hours painting their homes.

Lisa Winter, 35, (pictured) and her husband Martin, 36, have spent hours repainting their home in Yatton, Somerset, after the Dulux paint faded to yellow.

The couple painted all the doors and skirting in the hallway, landing, bathrooms and bedrooms in Dulux white satinwood after moving in.

Mum-of-two Lisa, a freelance writer, said: 'We recently had the skirting replaced in the hallway and when we put fresh white paint on there it showed up just how yellow the old paint was.

'So we’ve had to repaint everything and it’s going to take ages because there are so many doors to do.

'It’s very annoying because you expect white paint to stay white for longer than a few years. Especially when you pay extra for a leading brand name like Dulux.'

Colin Beare, 58, was offered £500 in compensation after 11 doors of his home and the flat he rents went yellow just weeks after he applied the paint.

But the general manager at a car salvage yard, from Gillingham, Dorset, is now taking the company to the Small Claims Court - insisting it will cost £2,000 to re-paint.

He said: 'I feel like I have been cheated - I was devastated when they told me what was wrong with the paint.

'It is obviously something they must have known about. I first started to notice it was discolouring after a matter of just weeks.

'I eventually came to the realisation that something was not quite right - at first I thought I had done something wrong - it looked horrendous.

'To my surprise Dulux actually put their hand up straight away and said ‘yes we have a problem with this paint - it is a problem that we know about’.It pulls into question why they managed to sell it to me in the first place. They have offered me £500 in compensation but I have estimated it will cost £2,120 to re-paint.

The problem emerged in 2010 after the European Union forced all companies to reduce the amount of Volitle Organic Compounds (VOCs) in their oil-based paints.

Firms, including Dulux, were forced to reformulate their paints, but that led to its ‘brilliant white’ substance losing its colour.

Martin Horler, an expert decoration consultant, explained: 'To get rid of or reduce the amount of VOCs, you had to reduce the solvent.

'If you reduce the solvent you have to increase something else. So what they would have to do to keep it in liquid form would be to increase the drying oil.

'To increase the drying oil unfortunately causes more rapid yellowing of the paint.'

Dulux included the VOCs label on its tins - informing customers of the change - but fail to warn customers of the yellowing problem. It even boasted that its paint was ‘long-lasting’.

In contrast, rival Crown Paints put on some of its tins: 'Recent changes made to meet the reduced solvent levels...may lead to yellowing over time.'

John Chesters, who was given vouchers for new paint and £250 by Dulux after doors and frames in his home turned yellow, added: 'It was if we had chosen a different colour.

'It was a real shock. Also we were worried about having to do the work again. It was just totally unacceptable.'

Dulux claims it has now solved the problem that had affected a 'small minority' of customers.

Matt Pullen, a UK director of Dulux, speaking on BBC’s Watchdog programme which highlighted the issue, said: 'This is a problem that affected the whole industry.

'We reformulated our products as did everyone else. We started to see a problem in the market in 2010 for a small minority of customers under certain conditions.

'As soon as we saw that we put all our energies into solving the problem, which we did in 2011.

'We focused our efforts on actually solving the problem rather than making a disclaimer against it.

'All the products we have produced since 2011 - and is in the shops on sale today - is as good as it was pre-2010.

'For those individuals who have had a problem and have complained to us - we’ve resolved 95 per cent of all those complaints in a fair and reasonable way.

'People can have confidence in what we are doing.'
