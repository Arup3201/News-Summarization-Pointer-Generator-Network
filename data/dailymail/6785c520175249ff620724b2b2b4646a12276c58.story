Freed Amanda Knox is in regular contact with her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, he has revealed in an interview.

The couple were sensationally cleared of murdering and sexually assaulting student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox, 24.

She and Sollecito, 27, had been seeing each other for a week before the brutal murder and initially they had been sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively but they were released on appeal earlier this month.

Breaking his silence for the first time in an interview with glossy Italian weekly Oggi, computer studies graduate Sollecito said: 'We need each other - we speak to each other on the phone and write to each other every day.'

Then, speaking of his invitation to visit Knox in her hometown of Seattle, Sollecito added: 'I will certainly go and see Amanda. She asked me over and I accepted with pleasure and there is no saying I will wait until Christmas.

'I could go earlier - I could go at any moment. I really want to see her again, to speak with her and look into her eyes.

'We need to speak and write to each other to try and understand what happened to us and to look forward to a future that appeared broken forever but instead we can still build on.

'We have so many things to say to each other. We spent four years in a circle of hell, we suffered unspeakably and it ruined our lives.'

Knox has kept a low profile since she 
was freed and is said to be negotiating a money-spinning TV interview 
deal with an American TV network which could make her $1 million - with 
the potential of earning up to ten times that amount as well.

Since returning to Seattle she has been seen out and about with friends but generally keeping a low profile and spending time with her family.

She was pictured out in downtown Seattle earlier this month with best friend Madison Paxton, who stayed close to her while she was in prison, and days earlier taking a drive with her step-father Chris Mellas.

She wrote in prison of how she longed to
 see her former boyfriend, David Johnsrud, and he was one of the first 
to pay her a visit on her return, although her father Curt stressed their 
relationship was now one simply of ‘friendship’.

Asked how his daughter had changed since
 she was jailed, Mr Knox said in an interview earlier this month that she was little different, other than 
occasionally slipping into speaking Italian and being less trusting of 
authority after her experience with Italian police. ‘It’s almost like 
she hasn’t lost a step with the family, which is nice to see,’ he said.

He said his daughter had to remain 
largely indoors for the moment, describing it as ‘a different version of
 jail’ but said she had at least been able to lie down in the grass – 
something she had longed for while in prison.

Mr Knox also revealed his daughter was being shadowed by a bodyguard and the family has been inundated with hate mail and threatening phone calls.

Knox and Sollecito, from Bisceglie near Bari, were originally found guilty in 2009 of the murder which had taken two years previously in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia.

However the appeal heard how the original evidence used to convict them was flawed and contaminated and they were freed after an independent forensic report ordered by the judge condemned the forensic investigation.

trial in 2008

Key to the case was a 30cm kitchen knife found in Sollecito's apartment and on which was said to be DNA from Knox on the handle and that of Meredith on the blade.

But the report said the amount on the knife was so low is should not be used to convict Knox - although they confirmed it was her DNA on the handle but she argued she had used it to cook with.

DNA from Sollecito which was found on Meredith's bloodied bra clasp was also dismissed as it emerged it had been left in the murder scene for six weeks before being collected and leaving it open to contamination.

Prosecutors in Perugia have said they will appeal the decision but they will have to wait until the judge's written ruling on the verdict is published sometime in the New Year.

Meredith from Coulsdon, Surrey, was a Leeds University student and was in Perugia for her degree course and she had only been in Italy for two months before she was murdered in November 2007.

Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 24, was convicted of murder and sexual assault after a fast track trial in 2008 and originally sentenced to 30 years but this was later reduced to 16 on appeal.
