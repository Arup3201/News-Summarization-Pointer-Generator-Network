His attendance at the champagne bar will only increase his reputation as a champagne socialist.

Despite once being a card-carrying member of the Communist Party and who still describes himself as a 'communist-stroke-socialist', Mr Crow does appear to enjoy the finer things in life.

Although quick to point out that he still lives in a council house in North-East London, the union boss holidays on cruises around Barbados with his long-term partner.

He is also fond of dining at exclusive restaurants like Scotts, in Mayfair, London and Rules, in Covent Garden, London.

Mr Crow recently came under fire for running up a £650 bill at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair.

during the meal before moving on to bottles of Morgassi Superiore 2009

The lunch at London's most exclusive restaurant marked Mr Crow's 50th birthday.

A
 fellow diner reportedly said: 'When they got to the table they had a round
 of beers, served in beautiful crystal glasses, then ordered champagne.

'It was served in champagne slippers - round saucer-like glasses.'
