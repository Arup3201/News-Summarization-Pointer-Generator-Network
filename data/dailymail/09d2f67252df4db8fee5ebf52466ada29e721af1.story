The glamour girl who is believed to have enraged a catwalk model who plunged to her death from a luxury apartment an hour after they met has been named as Lauren Penney.

Sahar Daftary, 23, had a furious row with her husband Rashid Jamil after discovering Miss Penney and her friend had been staying in the flat.

An hour after former escort Miss Penney and Helen Marshall, another escort, left the property, Miss Daftary fell 150ft to her death.

Property developer Mr Jamil has always insisted that Miss Daftary, a former Face of Asia winner, committed suicide – an explanation her family refused to accept.

Last week, almost four years after her death, a coroner recorded an open verdict into her death

The inquest heard that Miss  Penney had been living in Mr Jamil’s apartment in Salford Quays, Manchester, with Miss Marshall for a fortnight when she first met Miss Daftary.

Miss Penney did not attend the inquest but a statement from her was read out. It said she had been introduced to Mr Jamil by a mutual friend while on holiday in Dubai in July 2008.

The 28-year-old from Bolton, who also
 worked as a make-up artist, moved into his apartment with Miss 
Marshall, who worked for the same escort agency, in December 2008.

Mr
 Jamil would often ‘pop round’ to see Miss Marshall, but on the night of
 Miss Daftary’s death he was anxious for the escorts to leave.

‘Rashid was telling us that we  had to leave because he wanted to bring someone back to the flat,’ Miss Penney’s statement said. 

This angered Miss Marshall because Mr Jamil had said they could stay there.

But a short time later he and Miss Daftary came up to the flat.

‘Someone opened the door and there was this beautiful Asian woman standing there,’ Miss Penney’s statement said.

‘She looked very upset and  said, “Who are you and who brought you here?”

‘Helen and I were very surprised and shocked that this woman, who did not know us, was being angry towards us.’

Miss Penney said that throughout the confrontation Mr Jamil stood behind Miss Daftary looking ‘embarrassed’ and ‘sheepish’.

After a short while the two women left the flat and did not return until the following day, when they were informed of Miss Daftary’s death.

Mr Jamil, 37, was arrested on suspicion of murder but was released without charge.

Miss Daftary’s family accuse Greater Manchester Police of failing to carry out a proper investigation.

The Bolton inquest was told Miss Daftary had married Mr Jamil, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, in December 2007 in an Islamic wedding despite discovering that he was already married with two children.

Miss Daftary went to live with Mr Jamil at the exclusive NV Buildings at Salford Quays in May 2008.

But after two weeks the relationship broke down and she returned to her home in Brentford, West London.
