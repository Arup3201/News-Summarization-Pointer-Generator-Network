Discovery: Police have found a body on a beach close to where deputy headteacher Mark Bushnell (pictured) was last seen

Police searching for the deputy headteacher of a £25,000-a-year boarding school have found a body on a beach.

Mark Bushnell, a 50-year-old married father of three, parked his car at a seaside picnic spot two weeks ago, having left the family home in Durham, and has not been seen since.

The body was spotted close to where the deputy head of 600-year-old Durham School was last seen. He had worked at the school for 20 years.

The police said formal identification had not taken place but the family of Mr Bushnell had been informed.

A Durham Constabulary spokesman said: 'Police searching for missing Durham teacher Mark Bushnell have been alerted to a report of a body on the beach close to where Mr Bushnell was last seen.

'The report came from a member of the public and police are currently at the scene close to Blackhall Rocks in Peterlee.

'A formal identification has yet to be carried out and Mr Bushnell's family have been informed.'

Specialist search officers have previously been searching the area.

Stretches of railway line were also included in the search efforts and assistance was given by HM Coastguard, the National Police Air Support helicopter and volunteers from Teesdale and Weardale Search & Mountain Rescue.

Earlier this month when the search was on-going Martin George, the headmaster of Durham School, whose alumni include actor Alexander Armstrong and British Lions player Geoff Parling, spoke of the school's 'deep concern' over Mr Bushnell's disappearance.

He said at the time: 'Mark is a highly respected colleague and friend at Durham School, as deputy head he constantly works for the benefit of pupils.

'The whole school community is deeply concerned for his welfare and would urge him to contact his family as a matter of urgency.

'We would also ask any members of the public who may have seen Mark to contact police immediately.'
