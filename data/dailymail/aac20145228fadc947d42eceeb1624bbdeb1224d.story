Named after him: The BBC may reconsider renaming a wing at the London headquarters after John Peel following claims of an affair

The BBC may reconsider their decision to name part of their London headquarters after the late DJ John Peel amid claims he had an affair with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.

Jane Nevin claimed she may have even become pregnant by Peel during a three-month affair she met the BBC star presenter backstage at a Black Sabbath concert in the summer of 1969.

The plans to rename the Egton Wing of the BBC London headquarters, the Peel Wing are now being questioned following Mrs Nevin's claims.

Mrs Nevin says she was ‘in awe’ of the 
Radio 1 DJ, then 30, and that they would go to his London BBC studio or 
backstage at concerts to make love.

According to the BBC,
 a BBC spokesman said: 'Clearly, in the event of proven allegations of 
sexual abuse the BBC would reconsider its decision on the naming of part
 of our new building.'

The 
renaming of the Broadcasting House was announced in March this year and 
at the time, then-director general Mark Thompson said it was 'a fitting 
tribute to a man who personified so much of what the BBC stands for'.

Peel had unprotected sex with the teenager shortly after boasting on-air that he had been suffering from a venereal disease.

They split up when her mother found out 
about the relationship. But she discovered she was pregnant shortly 
after, aged 16, and had a ‘traumatic’ abortion at a clinic in Ealing.

‘I was devastated when I found out I 
was pregnant,’ she said. ‘I didn’t even think about telling John. I just
 wanted it to be over.’

When
 Mrs Nevin wrote to Peel out of the blue 30 years later mentioning their
 ‘brief affair’, he replied expressing his relief that she was not 
writing to confess she had his secret child.

On a postcard sealed in an envelope, Peel, who died in 2004, wrote: ‘Well, you’ve scared the daylights out of me. For years I’ve been expecting a letter starting, “In the 70s we had a brief affair – and your now son/daughter, aged 27, wants to meet you”.’

Mrs Nevin, 59, who lives in Capel, 
Surrey, decided to break her silence after allegations emerged that 
fellow BBC DJs abused dozens of teenage girls during this period.

The
 latest revelation will raise questions over the conduct of other 
celebrities within the corporation during the 1960s and 1970s.

She said: ‘He [Peel] must have known I was still at school. But he didn’t ask and I didn’t tell him.

‘At
 the time I was just so happy to be on his arm. I was young and he was 
famous. All I cared about was that I could make all my school friends 
jealous.

‘I was insecure and impressionable. I suppose I used him for his fame and he used me for sex.’

It echoes Peel’s own admission that he
 received sexual favours from young fans, once quipping: ‘Well, of 
course, I didn’t ask for ID.’

The DJ ran a Schoolgirl Of The Year 
competition on his long-running late-night Radio 1 Show and once 
complained that American virgins ‘would do anything but s*** you’. Mrs 
Nevin met Peel when she was invited backstage at a Black Sabbath concert
 in central London. She was hoping to meet the band, including Ozzy 
Osbourne, but instead caught the eye of Peel.

She
 said: ‘He came over and started talking to me. I was totally in awe of 
John. I adored his long hair and beard and he talked so intensely about 
music.

‘After that night, we would meet up about once a week. If we had sex, we never went to his place.

‘It would always be in his studio or backstage at the Roundhouse in Camden.

'Didn't ask': Mrs Nevine claims that Peel (left in 1968, right in 2005) must have known she was still at school. She said 'he didn't ask and I didn't tell'

‘I loved the status of knocking around with him. He would invite me to gigs and I would follow him around like a lapdog. I don’t know if sex was expected but I went along with it willingly. Looking back, it was terribly wrong and I was perhaps manipulated. But it was a different era.’

She admits it was a difficult period in her life. ‘I was badly bullied at school for being posh. I went to private school in South London until I was 11, but when my father died, my mother couldn’t afford to keep me there so I went to the local comprehensive in Wandsworth.

‘I did horse riding and dance classes at Italia Conti. I didn’t fit in. As a result, I was desperate to be loved.’

At the time, Peel was separated from 
Shirley Anne Milburn, a fan he had married in 1965 in America when she 
was only 15. He later claimed she had lied about her age.

When Mrs Nevin’s mother, an antiques restorer, found out her daughter was dating the DJ, she was horrified.

‘One night he called the house and my 
mother gave him hell,’ said Mrs Nevin. ‘She knew he had spoken about 
having VD because it had been in the papers. That put an end to us 
seeing each other.’

Later, a
 test confirmed she was pregnant. ‘My mother was very upset. She was 
worried I had ruined my life. My auntie had to lend her the money and I 
went to a clinic in Ealing. It was probably the worst day of my life.’

'I was totally in awe of John. I adored his long hair and beard and he talked so intensely about music. After that night, we would meet up about once a week. If we had sex, we never went to his place'

Jane Nevin

Mrs Nevin went on to become a bunny girl croupier at the Playboy club in Park Lane in the 1970s. She later ran a pub with her husband, from whom she is separated, and had a son, now 24.

Peel divorced his teenage Texan bride Shirley in 1973 and married Sheila Gilhooly a year later. They had four children and lived in Great Finborough, Suffolk.

It was from this address that he wrote the letter to Mrs Nevin in the late 1990s, after she asked him to appear at the opening of her new bar in Surrey.

He rebuffed her invite, ending the postcard: ‘I live near Ipswich so Croydon is pretty inaccessible. I’ll wait to hear from you again, John.’

Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘We are asking that any criminal allegations should be passed either to the BBC investigations unit or directly to the police.’

An insider added: ‘This is another terrible allegation and hopefully she will take this to the police so they can investigate.’
