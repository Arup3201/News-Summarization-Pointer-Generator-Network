This is the man who allegedly ruined Christmas for thousands of children after bringing down the Xbox and Playstation networks.

In a brazen television interview, the man, who went by the name 'Ryan' said he and a small group launched the Christmas Day cyber attack on computer games consoles.

He claimed that the group he was part of carried out the hack partly for amusement - and to expose poor security.

December 25 was ruined for children across the country who were forced to abandon plans to spend the holidays in a virtual world playing on their new Playstation or Xbox games systems due to internet hackers.

In a brazen television interview, the man (pictured), who went by the name 'Ryan' said he and a small group launched the Christmas Day cyber attack on computer games consoles. 

Children were reduced to tears during the 'worst Christmas ever' and parents fumed about paying hundreds of pounds for games consoles that could not be used.

A notorious group of hackers called Lizard Squad said it carried out the hack 'for the laughs' and to expose poor online security.

Now the man known as Ryan - who is thought to be a member of the group - has given an interview on Sky News saying a small team had masterminded the attack, adding that he understood 'it's a bit unethical'.

Speaking from Finland, he said: 'This attack was basically done by three people. We had a couple of people from outside the group helping with the attacks, helping us a little bit, but most of the traffic was coming from one or two people.

Mark Haynes said there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie (pictured), 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing

Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service

When asked why the group carried out the attack he said: 'Mostly to raise awareness - to amuse ourselves.

'Also one of the big aspects here was raising awareness regarding the low state of computer security at these companies.'

He added that he would be 'worried' if children 'didn't have anything better to do than play games on their consoles on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.' 

Meanwhile, a British man was last night named as one of the hackers who carried out the devastating attack.

Vincent Omari was said by a rival group to be a member of Lizard Squad. 

Last night Mr Omari, 22, denied the accusation. Speaking outside his parents’ home in Twickenham, South-West London, he said: ‘I am not a member of Lizard Squad. I am not one of the hackers. It is a case of mistaken identity.’

However, in messages believed to have been posted by Omari, a Twitter user with the tag @VinnSec admitted he was the ‘spokesperson for the group’, adding that police knew about cyber attack ‘and they have all my info if needed’.

Earlier, Mr Omari spoke to Sky News and presented himself as ‘an independent security analyst’, without any suggestion of him being a member of the hacking group.

Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch'

However, on BBC Radio 5 Live, an unnamed man with an identical voice who said he had just turned 22 admitted being part of the attack. Mr Omari turned 22 on Christmas Eve. A second Lizard Squad member has been identified online as a 16-year-old grammar schoolboy in Kent.

The consoles rely on an internet connection for many of their functions. 

Parents were so angered by the issues with the machines, which cost up to £349, that they wrote hundreds of messages to both companies on Twitter accompanied by the message '#christmasruined'.

Ros Bruce said her ten-year-old son had spent weeks planning what games he and his friend would play together ahead of receiving an Xbox One for Christmas. 

The boy was sorely disappointed when he tried to download a game and was still unable to play it more than 15 hours later. 

Miss Bruce, from Essex, said: 'He has spent most of the day in tears. He says it's been his worst Christmas ever. I think Xbox should compensate us all.'

A Twitter user from Scotland also called for a refund and said: '£450 later and the kids have an expensive plastic paperweight.'

Mark Haynes told the Daily Mail there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie, 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing.

Mr Haynes, 50, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, criticised Microsoft's response to the problem after calling technical support four times only to be told by one staff member that the company 'had no idea what was going on'.

The hack took down Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network. Popular games such as Call Of Duty and The Sims 4 were all but useless for frustrated gamers.

Analysts said that the attack was a DDOS, or distributed denial of service attack, in which online networks are overwhelmed by traffic, leaving normal users unable to gain access.

One of the most popular features of the consoles is the ability to play against friends and other users who are in different locations. This feature, however, requires an internet connection and many children were left disappointed at their inability to use it.

While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up.

Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack.

A message on the Xbox status page yesterday said that its core services were 'up and running' but PlayStation said engineers were continuing to work on 'network issues'.

There has been no official link between the incident and the infiltration of Sony's computers by hackers said to be working for North Korea.

However, Sony and Microsoft were heavily involved in the release of The Interview, the comedy film about the communist nation which has angered its tyrannical leader Kim Jong-Un; the film centres on a plot by two American journalists to assassinate him.

Sony's entertainment division produced the movie, and Microsoft made it available to stream on its Xbox film service.

There are 48million worldwide subscribers to the Xbox's internet features, and more than double that for the PlayStation, which has some 110million.

Last month Sony announced that it had sold one million consoles in the UK just eight months after launching, with a sales boost expected before Christmas.

In an interview on tech website Winbeta, Lizard Squad said that it had carried out the attack on Christmas Day to 'anger and reach the largest amount of people'. It claimed that the attack was to highlight poor online security and that Microsoft had barely any protection at all for its Xbox online network.

Earlier today, it was revealed how a gang of internet hackers claiming an affiliation with shadowy anarchist group Anonymous claimed it had leaked the details of more than 13,000 users of Playstation, Xbox and online stores including Amazon.

The hackers posted a document online containing username and password combinations. They also added credit card numbers as well as expiry dates.

The group told their followers that they hacked the account details 'for the Lulz'.

According to Dailydot.com , the hackers released account information from users of Xbox Live, Sony Playstation Network and Twitch.tv.

The hackers also released details they claimed came from retailers such as Walmart and Amazon.

They also released details from a host of pornography websites.

In addition they ripped Sony's controversial movie The Interview and uploaded it to a file-sharing website where it could be downloaded illegally.

It is understood that thousands of gamers have already complained to both Sony and Microsoft who have been hit by the network problems.

The hackers are believed to have used a denial of service attack, where they bombard the targets servers with internet traffic forcing it to shut down and preventing legitimate access.

The hackers claimed on Twitter to have released customer information of some 13,000 account holders

They also claimed to have ripped a copy of The Interview which could then be downloaded illegally
