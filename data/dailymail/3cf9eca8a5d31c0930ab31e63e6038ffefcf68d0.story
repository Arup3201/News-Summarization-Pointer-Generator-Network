Gavin Dunnicliffe, 30, from Derby, was sentenced to six years in jail in Derbyshire Crown Court for the violent assault on his victim which his lawyer described to the court as '54 seconds of madness'

A video has captured the moment a thug attacked a man with piping and beat him 55 times in 54 seconds.

Gavin Dunnicliffe, 30, from Derby, was jailed for six years for the violent assault which his lawyer called '54 seconds of madness'.

His victim was left with head wounds, a broken arm and fingers and cuts to his legs and back.

The video shows Dunnicliffe striking his victim for almost a minute without pausing.

Derbyshire Crown Court heard yesterday that Dunnicliffe was in a relationship with the ex-partner of his victim, a 47-year-old taxi driver.

The attack was so violent Derbyshire Police originally charged him with attempted murder - later downgraded to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to which Dunnicliffe pleaded guilty yesterday.

Jailing him, Judge John Burgess said: 'You told police the weapon was a length of rubber or plastic piping.

'If that had been a metal bar this man would be dead and you would be facing a murder charge.

'What you did that night was quite terrible, a sustained and powerful attack and as we saw on the CCTV sometimes you were holding that weapon with both hands.

'He suffered serious injuries which saw him stay in hospital for three days and then there are the mental scars he has suffered.

'This offence involved a degree of planning and it involved the use of a weapon.

'It was a sustained assault.'

Mark Van Der Zwart, prosecuting, at Derby Crown Court, said that the attack happened shortly before midnight on December 15 last year.

He said the victim had been involved in a confrontation with the woman's daughter, Jade Austin, the previous night outside a nightclub in Derby.

Mr Van Der Zwart said: 'On the night in question, Mr Dunnicliffe had set off to find him and attack him. Precisely why he should go out on this mission is not plain.'

He said the victim had been drinking in two pubs and Dunnicliffe had been in both pubs asking people if they had seen him.

He said: 'The victim went to the Yaadgaar takeaway in Littleover and left shortly before midnight.

'The defendant followed him on to South Avenue where the attack took place.

'In a victim impact statement, the victim tells how he has been left with a visible dent in his head from his injury and that he suffers flashbacks. He feels on edge and there are mental scars.'

Alwyn Jones, for Dunnicliffe, said his client 'wholeheartedly accepts what he did was wrong' and that it was 'unforgiveable and atrocious'.

Mr Jones said: 'He knows he must suffer for the 54 seconds of madness we have seen on the screen.

'His progress during his time in custody shows that, as and when the prison gates open, he has the potential to be a valuable member of society. There is a reference from the prison chaplain.'

'There is no excuse for how he behaved and he accepts that he went out that night to confront the victim.

'He has a supportive family unit when he comes out of prison.'
