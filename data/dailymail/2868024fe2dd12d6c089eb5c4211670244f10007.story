Human remains found on a remote Alaska island have been identified as those of a missing French adventurer, Alaska State Troopers said.

Francois Guenot, 32, dubbed 'the crazy Frenchman', vanished in May after embarking on a kayaking trip, Alaska Dispatch News  reported. 

His destination was Perryville, a small community hundreds of miles away from Kokhanok on the Alaska Peninsula.

The remains of the 32-year-old man were found in September on Shuyak Island north of Kodiak. 

The state medical examiner's office identified the remains using dental records, troopers said Wednesday. 

Mystery: Francois Guenot was last seen in Kohanok on the Alaska Peninsula and planned to kayak hundreds of miles to Perryville. Remains found on Shuhak Island in September have been identified as his body

Guenot, from Maiche, France, began appearing last year in southwest Alaska villages. 

He told people he had walked, canoed and bicycled across Canada and through Alaska, and planned to reach Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. 

He was last seen in early May near Kokhanok and friends last heard from him late that month, when he was near Kamishak Bay, on the coast of Katmai National Park and Preserve.

A kayak believed to be Guenot's was found by Katmai park rangers in June, and a waterproof bag was found 3 miles away. 

The kayak contained identification, food and maps, as well as an array of personal journals, according to rangers at the park, which is home to Alaskan brown bears. 

His last journal entry was dated June 15. 

The Coast Guard launched a brief search of the area but found no sign of the missing man.

Guenot's father and brother arrived in Alaska in August to press authorities to continue searching. They reasoned that survival items such as a compass, tarp and knife were not among the items found.

A volunteer cleaning up marine debris on the beach at Shuyak Island found the remains, which were wearing a rain jacket, chest waders and gloves.

Mr Guenot, who worked as a ski instructor in Maiche, had spent more than two years trekking across Canada before venturing to Alaska.

He arrived in Canada in the summer of 2011 to begin his trek across North America, which included several misadventures, including falling into a river in the winter.

He eventually made his way to Fairbanks, where he found a bike at the dump and rode it to Homer, before venturing to Seldovia, where he found two kayaks and made them into one seaworthy vessel.

In
 January
 2012, he told Yukon News that he dreamed of adventure in the wilds of Canada and Alaska,
 saying: 'I don't want to stay like a dog on a leash in France.'

Treacherous: The adventurer is believed to have been making his way from Kokhanok to Perryville. Katmai National Park ranger Wendy Artz said the land between the two villages in home to more bears than people

After showing up in south-west Alaska, Mr Guenot befriended Kokhanok resident Gary Nielsen and lived on his property in a tent.

When it was too cold to sleep outside, Mr Nielsen said the explorer - who earned his nickname based on his ultimate goal to reach the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia - would sleep in a steam bath.

He added that Mr Guenot had set off in May, telling him that he was going to Perryville, but had seemed to have trouble comprehending the great distances involved in travelling Alaska.

Earlier this year, the adventurer had spent three weeks walking around Lake Iliamna during spring break up, but somehow came back in one piece, he said.

Meanwhile, another of Mr Guenot's friends, Jim Tilley of Intricate Bay, said many locals were concerned about him, telling the Daily News: 'He was just aloof to the dangers of Alaska.'

Mr Neilsen said Mr Guenot had been planning to meet up with friends on July 19 when he vanished.

'If we hear nothing by the end of July, he's probably dead,' he added.
