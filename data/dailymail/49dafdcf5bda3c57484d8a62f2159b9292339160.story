A new laser therapy that bores microscopic holes in the skin is being touted as a way to erase stretch marks on the stomach, thighs and breasts, with minimal pain and downtime.

The Icon system is the first treatment for the common form of scarring to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

All scars are notoriously difficult to treat, yet exceedingly common; most people have at least one.

And stretch marks are estimated to affect up to 90 per cent of women during pregnancy.

Icon has a fractional laser that uses heat to create microscopic channels deep within the skin, while leaving the surface almost untouched.

These tiny injuries break down  scar tissue and are said to trigger a natural healing response. An inbuilt scanner assesses skin type and automatically adjusts settings to avoid pigment changes.

Studies show that on average, Icon reduces stretch marks by between  51 and 75 per cent, including those that are many years old. It can also be used on acne, surgical and burn scars.

Skin expert Dr Tapan Patel, medical director of the PHI Clinic in London, the first in the UK to offer the treatment, said: ‘No two scars are ever the same, so no one treatment will be suitable for all of them.

'However, I am seeing some good results with the Icon. It does not harm the top layer  of skin, which means it’s a more comfortable treatment than some other lasers.

'Patients don’t need pain relief and have less downtime.’

In general, scars form if a wound takes longer than three or four weeks to be covered with new skin.

Stretch marks most often occur during puberty and pregnancy when the skin expands rapidly.

Reality television star Kim Kardashian was recently filmed having laser treatment on pregnancy-related stretch marks on her breasts.

However, conventional laser treatments have not always been effective.

They have a reputation for being very painful, and only helpful on new, red scars.

Another side effect is pigment changes such as a permanent darkening of the skin.

Dr Patel said: ‘I had previously treated a woman with a burn mark  on her chest using a different laser that was effective but left her so red and sore that she had to take several days off work.

But when I treated her with the Icon, the redness went away within a few hours.’

Patients usually require two to six treatments costing £350 each, four to eight weeks apart.
