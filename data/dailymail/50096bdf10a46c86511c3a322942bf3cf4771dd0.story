England are set to meet San Marino in their Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on Thursday night with an estimated 40,000 less supporters than when the two sides last met in London two years ago.

The FA expects an attendance around 50,000 for the match against FIFA’s equal lowest-ranked team, making it likely to become the least attended competitive international football fixture at the stadium since the new Wembley opened in 2007.

The crowd will be even lower than when England faced Andorra in a June 2009 World Cup qualifier before 57,897 people on a night coinciding with a London Underground strike.

The last meeting with San Marino, a World Cup qualifier on October 12, 2012, was attended by 86,654 fans who witnessed a 5-0 win for the hosts with doubles from Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck, and one from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Apathy in the wake of England’s World Cup failure, in which Roy Hodgson’s side failed to make it out of the group stage, has been largely blamed for diminished interest in the national team.

A paltry 40,181 turned out for the 1-0 friendly win over Norway last month at Wembley, the lowest attendance for any senior international.

An improved performance in their Euro 2016 qualifying opener against Switzerland in Basle, won 2-0 by Hodgson's men, was an encouraging sign for fans but hasn't translated into ticket sales.
