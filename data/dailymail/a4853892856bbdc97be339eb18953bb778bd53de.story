The marriage license of mass murderer Charles Manson and a 26-year-old devotee who believes in his innocence is set to expire without a wedding taking place, prison officials said Monday.

California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesman Jeffrey Callison said weekend visiting for inmates passed without Manson getting married.

Afton Elaine Burton and the 80-year-old Manson obtained a 90-day marriage license late last year. It expires Thursday, making this past weekend the couple's final opportunity to hold a wedding inside a visiting room at California State Prison, Corcoran. 

If the wedding is to happen, the couple must register for a new Kings County marriage license.

No wedding yet: Star, 26, says she has been a fan on Manson, 80, since she was a teenager. They had planned to marry, but after 90 days with no wedding, their Kings County, California license to marry will expire

Burton, who goes by the name 'Star' and says she loves Manson, left her home halfway across the country and has spent the last nine years living near the Central California prison.

Manson was convicted of killing seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, the wife of director Roman Polanski.

Burton, who maintains websites espousing Manson's innocence, has not responded to recent requests seeking comment on the relationship. 

Too late: The infamous cult leader had his final opportunity to marry Burton during visitation hours over the weekend before the license expires Thursday

Shortly after obtaining the license, she told The Associated Press the nuptials were imminent: 'Y'all can know that it's true,' she said in November. 'It's going to happen.'

Not long after that, Star was spotted fabric shopping and looking at white satin, possibly for a wedding dress to sew for the jailhouse ceremony.

Star has been writing to Manson since she was a teen and even moved from her home in Illinois to the California town where he is imprisoned.

Previous reports had said the two were already married, but a formal ceremony had yet to be held.

The couple filed for a marriage license on November 7, which gave them just 90 days to carry out the nuptials. 

California Department of Corrections spokesman Jeffrey Callison previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day, which happen on Saturdays, Sundays and certain holidays (including Thanksgiving).

Callison said the couple would be allowed 10 guests from outside the prison, two guests from inside the prison and an officiant of their own choosing.

However, the two are not be allowed to consummate their marriage since Manson's life in prison sentence bans him from receiving conjugal visits.

In previous interviews, Star gushed about falling in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teen, and how she already considered herself married to him.

James McGrath, a New York City photo agency editor, said that he maintains contact with Burton and that she intends to obtain another 90-day license and go ahead with the marriage.

Looked at fabrics: Manson was granted a marriage license to marry Star in November of last year, which would expire in 90 days. Soon after getting the license, Star was spotted out looking at fabrics, potentially to sew a dress with for the ceremony

Postponed? Star's wedding would have had to take place during visitation hours this past weekend but they missed the mark

What's more, Manson's son Matthew Roberts has just recently revealed that one of the reasons his father is set to wed Burton is so that the two can have a child.

And while the two are not allowed conjugal visits, Roberts says of his father; 'Somehow he hopes to smuggle his sperm out of the prison.'

He then added; 'He wants to see what it might be like to raise a child with more of his own ideas. He is starting to think about how he wants his legacy to be left once he’s gone.'

Roberts also said in his interview with The Mirror that his father has wanted this for many years.

'Part of the whole thing with him marrying Star is that he would love to have kids and he was waiting for someone to come along and provide that,' he explained.

Manson became notorious in 1969 as the leader of a 'family' of young killers. Manson follower Susan Atkins died of cancer behind bars, but Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel remain imprisoned. So do Charles 'Tex' Watson, Bruce Davis and Robert Beausoleil, who is expected to have a parole hearing Feb. 19. Manson is eligible for parole next in 2027.
