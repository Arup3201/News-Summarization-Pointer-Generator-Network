Casey Anthony has become the most vilified woman in America, condemned as a compulsive liar and heartless mother who murdered her own
 daughter so she could spend her life shopping and partying.

But with today's sensational not-guilty verdict, the 25-year-old could be free as early as Thursday morning to begin the slow process of rebuilding her life - and cash in on her new-found celebrity status.

There is already speculation the compelling case could be turned into a movie, and she is likely to be inundated with 
lucrative television and book deals worth millions of dollars.

Despite the acquittal of capital murder charges, the Casey family lawyer said it was too early to say if they would welcome Casey back.

Sheer relief: Casey Anthony reacts after she is found not guilty of murder in Orlando today - but she will now have to pick up the pieces of her life and confront her family after a trial that ripped the Anthonys apart

Speaking after the verdict he said: 'The family hopes that they will be 
given the time by the media to reflect on this verdict and decide the 
best way to move forward privately.'

Although Casey smiled and broke into tears
 of delight as she learned she had escaped the death penalty, she is 
also likely to face the fear of attack from an angry public who were 
stunned by the jury's decision.

She will also have to confront her 
family, which was torn apart after her defence team dramatically accused
 both her father and brother of sexually abusing her.

Only one thing will be certain when she 
walks out of the Florida courtroom: Anthony will never againÂ  
live an anonymous life.

Anthony's trial, for the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee in June 2008, has captivated the nation.

Countless chat shows will give her the 
opportunity of telling her story for the first time - an offer she seems
 likely to take up, after her defence team had to dissuade her from 
giving testimony at the trial.

And because she has been found not guilty, there is nothing to stop Anthony selling her story to the highest bidder.

Adult entertainment company Vivid has even offered her a career as a porn star.

After her release, it is not clear where she will live, or how she will be reintegrated into society.

What does the future hold? Casey Anthony breaks down as the verdict is read out, left, and she breaks into a smile, right. She is now likely to be inundated with countless chat show offers and book deals

Stony-faced: In stark contrast to the scenes of jubilation, Cindy and George Anthony were the first to leave the courtroom today, and remained emotionless as the verdict was read out

She will face constant security fears, and it seems unlikely police will continue to provide protection after her release from jail.

Anthony found herself abandoned by many of her friends during her trial, who gave evidence saying she was proud of being a 
'good liar', and even entered a 'hot body' competition at a night club 
just days after defence lawyers claimed Caylee drowned.

It seems impossible that Anthony could return 
to her parents' Florida home, after the trial ripped the family apart 
with allegations of rape and incest.

In a statement after the verdict, Cindy and George Anthony described their daughter's defence as 'baseless', but said they had achieved 'closure for this chapter of their life.

Anthony appears to have become close to her legal team, and she may stay with defence attorneys Jose Baez or Dorothy Sims, who wept 
after the not-guilty verdict was read out.

Her freedom means she could also resume the party-loving life for which the prosecution claimed she murdered her daughter.

Shocked: Crowds of people gathered outside the courtroom for the verdict, and many were visibly stunned by the jury's decision

Despite the not-guilty verdict, Anthony will face an upward struggle to clear her name.

Her trial attracted intense media 
attention, and there were even fights in the courtroom as angry members 
of the public attempted to catch a glimpse of the woman portrayed as a 
cold-hearted murderess.

She was condemned by her own defence team in court as a liar, and the 
jury convicted her on four counts of deceiving police as she wove a web 
of lies following her daughter's disappearance.

Although each of those misdemeanour 
counts carries up to a year in prison, she is likely to walk free at 
sentencing on Thursday after having already spent three years in jail.

Anthony
 will struggle to rebuild her relationship with her parents. Cindy and 
George Anthony stood by their daughter throughout the investigation and 
trial, risking foreclosure on their home by paying her legal bills.

Mrs
 Anthony even tried to protect her daughter by apparently lying to the 
court, claiming she, rather than Casey, carried out searches for 
chloroform on the home computer.

Innocent victim: Caylee Anthony, whose skeletal remains were found with evidence that her mouth and nose had been covered in duct tape

But Anthony's own lawyers dropped a bombshell which rocked the entire trial when they accused her father of sexually abusing her since the age of eight.

They alleged Caylee drowned in a swimming pool, and at her father's insistence Anthony tried to cover up the death.

During testimony, the defence also questioned whether tests had been 
conducted to determine if Casey Anthony's brother Lee was the father of 
her daughter Caylee.

The judge ordered her legal team not to mention the incest allegations in their closing arguments, but the shocking claims will make it impossible for the Anthonys to return to anything resembling a normal family life.

Defeated: Assistant state attorneys Jeff Ashton and Linda Drane Burdick sit at the prosecution table, seemingly in shock, after the verdict

Mr and Mrs Anthony were expressionless as the verdict was read out, and left the court as their daughter was still being embraced by her jubilant legal team.

If she is released as expected on Thursday, it is likely she will be looked after by her lawyers in the short-term.

The Orlando Sentinel reported that 
she had just $94.49 in her bank account last Wednesday, and she has 
largely been supported by her parents.

But even before today's verdict, 
Anthony had received donations from wellwishers across the nation, 
allowing her to buy personal items while she was on trial, including 
shampoo, black mascara, nachos and BBQ chips.

She seems to have spent much of her time writing, ordering two boxes of 20 pens to be delivered to her prison cell during her trial.

Those wellwishers may come to her aid now, as she prepares herself for life outside prison for the first time in three years.
