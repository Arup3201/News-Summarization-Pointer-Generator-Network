Britain has seen a surge in the number of people living in large households because of the so-called ‘sandwich generation’, a report revealed yesterday.

More than three million of us now live in a household with at least five other individuals.

The Office for National Statistics said this reflects the increase in adults nicknamed the ‘sandwich generation’ because they are not only caring for their children but also their ageing parents.

Ladder: The difficulty of getting on to the housing ladder is one reason for the squeeze on space

With young people struggling to get on to the housing ladder, more and more are having to live with their parents because they cannot afford a home of their own.

There were 543,000 households with at least six residents, according to the analysis of Census data from England and Wales.

This has made it the fastest-growing category of housing, with a 25 per cent jump in ten years.

The rise was seen in every region of England and Wales, apart from the North East.

The ONS report said: ‘All of these areas have been identified as having high proportions of concealed families [such as inter-generational families], high levels of overcrowding and also have high proportions of the population identifying with Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi ethnic groups.’

More than one in ten households in the East London borough of Newham had at least six people living in.

Outside London, the areas with the highest proportion of ‘six or more’ were Luton, Slough, Bradford, Birmingham and Leicester.

The data also revealed a decrease in the number of traditional one family households with children – shrinking to 41 per cent of the household population from 43 per cent a decade earlier.

In 2013, more than 3.3million adults in the UK aged between 20 and 34 were living with a parent or parents – which was 26 per cent of the age group.

This is an increase of 25 per cent from 1996, according to the ONS.

In 2013, 49 per cent of 20 to  24-year-olds lived with their parents, compared with 21 per cent of 25 to 29-year-olds and 8 per cent of 30 to 34-year-olds.

By the age of 20, 65 per cent of men and 52 per cent of women were living with their parents in 2013.

This decreases steadily until around the age of 30, after which the percentages remain more stable.

By the age of 34, just 8 per cent of men and 3 per cent of women were living with their parents.

The ONS said: ‘A couple of factors may help explain this pattern. First, average earnings of young people increase during their twenties and level off in their mid-thirties.

‘Second, the likelihood of  living with a partner (either cohabiting or married) is higher at older ages.’
