Fed up with feeling ripped off and patronised by male mechanics? So was mother-of-two Caroline Lake, the brains behind Caroline's Cars - the UK's first all-female garage.

Now in its tenth year her business venture has proved so popular that many men - as well as women - flock to her Norwich workshop.

Caroline, 42, said: '[Going to] garages can be a terrifying experience for many women – I know women who prefer going to the dentist than going to a garage.

'I know women who have been ripped off, told their cars needed expensive work doing when it didn’t [or] just have men talking to their boobs and being leery.

'Women come here because they know they can trust me, and that I’m not going to rip them off. I want to encourage women to not be afraid and feel safe – it’s engrained in society that women automatically know nothing about cars.

'The success has even led to a strong demand by men to have their cars fixed and looked at by my garage – we’re getting a good reputation and I think people just warm to women.'

Caroline was forced to work as an unpaid apprentice for four years before she convinced her male boss to take her on as a paid employee.

As a result, she became one of the first women in the country to become a qualified MOT tester.

But after hearing countless complaints from women who had suffered harrowing experiences at male-dominated garages Caroline decided it was time to launch her own business.

Caroline said: 'Many women can leave feeling extremely intimidated and worried about the service they’re being given.

'Some women even know they’re being ripped off but are too scared to question the man’s diagnosis so pay extortionate amounts out of fear.'

Having launched her business with 
help from two friends Viv and Moranda, Caroline has since been forced to
 hire some manly helping hands to cope with the workload.

But there’s always pink overalls - the shop’s compulsory uniform - for any new additions. 

Caroline
 said: 'Whenever we have workshops we always get the men dressed up in 
pink uniforms - I even had my bank manager in them when he came in to my
 shop.'

With dreams of being able to franchise Caroline’s Cars and have test centres and garages across the UK, the motoring enthusiast also thinks women should learn more about their cars.

Caroline launched a series of educational classes for women introducing common faults and how to maintain cars but soon received requests from men to attend the women-only lessons.

Caroline said: 'A lot of men complained about my female-only teaching classes so of course I opened my arms to them and now we cater for anybody who wants to learn a bit more about their car and what to look out for.

'It’s not just young women who prefer a female garage; men are exactly the same about big burly mechanics and their "backstreet" reputations.

'I hope to expand my business and franchise it so we can have female garages up and down the country.'
