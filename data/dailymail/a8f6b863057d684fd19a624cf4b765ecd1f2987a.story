If two’s company and three’s a crowd, what do you get when you have three sets of twins?

For baby sisters Rowan and Isla 
Rodger, who have just become the third set of twins in their family, 
it’s double the brotherly love.

The girls, who were born two minutes 
apart, have Lewis and Kyle, 14, and Finn and Jude, 12, to spoil them – 
and help them through the trials of being a twin. 

Twin-credible! Mother Karen Rodger, who defied the odds by becoming pregnant with her third set of twins, is pictured holding her newborns Rowan (left) and Isla (right)

Parents Karen and Colin Rodger were 
told the odds of having three sets of twins were 500,000-1 when they 
found out they were expecting.

Mrs Rodger, 41, was convinced the 
doctors were right to think it was a rather unlikely prospect. ‘It never
crossed my mind that it would be twins again but I’m absolutely 
delighted,’ she said.

The dance lecturer was given the happy news during
her six-week scan, and immediately told  her husband in a text message.

‘He thought I was joking and 
immediately wrote back to say, “This is not funny”. I had to explain 
that it really was true,’ she said.

Doctors said there was a 500,000-1 chance that Mrs Rodger's third pregnancy would be twins

Surprise: Mrs Rodger found out she was having twins during a scan six weeks into the pregnancy and sent a text message with the news to her husband

The couple from Langbank, 
Renfrewshire, decided not to find out the sex of the babies before they 
arrived at Southern General Hospital in Glasgow last week.

Mrs Rodger 
said: ‘I was convinced I was having two boys. I’m still getting my head 
around the fact that there will be more girls in the house – people to 
steal my sparkly shoes and make-up.

‘I’m absolutely over the moon it’s girls. It’s definitely going to be a good journey ahead.’

However, Mr Rodger, 44, an events manager, has a few concerns – namely the inevitable worries of bringing up girls.  

‘Boyfriends will be completely unacceptable,’ he joked.

The girls, who are not identical, were delivered by caesarean section last Wednesday with Rowan arriving first followed two minutes later by Isla

‘I think the girls are going to have 
five dads with the boys looking out for them too, and it will be a 
frightening gauntlet for any boyfriend to run.’

Mrs Rodger will be 
counting on the boys too when her husband is away from home on work all 
of next month.

She said: ‘It is daunting but because the boys are a bit older, it makes it a bit easier.

‘They understand more and I’m going to need a lot of help from them.’
