Alex Salmond has stepped down as SNP leader with a prediction that his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, will 'make history' and secure independence for Scotland.

The outgoing First Minister made the forecast as he addressed the SNP annual conference in Perth shortly after Ms Sturgeon took over the reins as head of the party.

Ms Sturgeon will use her keynote speech today to suggest that her party will prop up a Labour government after the next General Election.

And she will pledge that her party will not do a deal with the Conservatives if David Cameron fails to win an overall majority at Westminster next year.

With a hung parliament being one possible outcome in May's general election, Ms Sturgeon said the nationalists - who have seen their support rise since the independence referendum - could hold the balance of power in the UK parliament.

As she makes her first speech as party leader at the SNP annual conference in Perth, she will say: 'The SNP will never put the Tories into government.'

In the general election, Labour will 'fall back on the same desperate mantras as before' and tell voters north of the border the only way to keep the Conservatives out of Downing Street is to back Ed Miliband's party.

But she will claim that is 'the biggest con trick in Scottish politics' and say voters must 'not fall for it again'.

Ms Sturgeon will recall: 'Scotland did vote Labour at the last general election, but we still ended up with the Tories.

'And if the people of England vote Tory next May, it won't matter how we vote, a Tory government is what we'll get. Or worse a Tory/Ukip government.'

If that happens, she will say Scotland will need 'strong SNP MPs who will stand up to the Tories, challenge the despicable politics of Nigel Farage and fight Scotland's corner'.

She will add: 'Perhaps this time Scotland's votes will count. Scotland could well hold the balance of power in a Westminster parliament with no overall majority.'

Ms Sturgeon will vow: 'If that happens, I promise you this - you won't need to have voted Labour to keep the Tories out, because that's what we'll do.

'My pledge to Scotland today is this - the SNP will never put the Tories into government.'

Mr Salmond announced that he would be resigning as both SNP leader and First Minister within hours of the referendum defeat in September.

Scotland has now 'changed utterly' as a result of that vote, he said.

He hailed Ms Sturgeon - who will be Scotland's first female First Minister - as a 'woman of extraordinary talent'.

Her mother, Joan Sturgeon, could be seen wiping away tears as she sat in the audience.

Mr Salmond told his successor: 'Nicola, your contribution to where this party now stands has already been immense.

'Your future contribution - I have no doubt - will be to make history.'

He told the conference the 'dream' of independence was 'alive and well and will succeed'. 

Mr Salmond said that in the referendum - in which the Yes campaign secured 45% of the vote - Scotland had risen to 'the challenge of change'.

He said: 'The people will not disappear back into the political shadows and the nation will not fade into the dark. This country has changed and changed utterly.

'That is the change which will carry us forward - forward to independence.'

While a majority of voters did not back independence in the referendum, Mr Salmond said he knew 'with a greater certainty than ever before' that the country would one day leave the UK.

'At various times in our national story, Scotland has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,' he said.

'This time, out of defeat will come future success.'

He insisted that September 18 would in future 'come to be seen as the day Scotland started to take control of our own destiny'.

He said that many No voters had been won over by the vow of substantial new powers made by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg in their 'last-minute promise of radical constitutional reform within the union'.

Mr Salmond told SNP activists: 'Be in no doubt - without that last-gasp concession, the No campaign would have had its just deserts.'

He went on to warn the leaders of the UK parties: 'If the Westminster gang reneges on that promise made in the campaign, they will discover that hell hath no fury like this nation scorned.'

Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown promised 'home rule' for Scotland when he made a 'brief cameo appearance as leader of Better Together' - the cross-party campaign for the union.

Ms Sturgeon will formally replace Alex Salmond as First Minister next week after a vote in Holyrood

While Mr Salmond said both the Conservatives and Labour would try to renege on the commitment, he stressed that 'Scotland expects the vow to be redeemed'.

Despite the referendum result, he said the SNP was 'invigorated as never before' as he set his party the challenge of winning a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster for the first time in next May's general election, and amassing 100,000 members by then.

'We have never been an ordinary political party,' Mr Salmond said.

'Now we are an extraordinary political party with a great task to be completed.'

While the SNP had 25,000 members at the time of the referendum, that membership has now swelled to more than 85,000.

Setting the target of increasing that further, Mr Salmond said: 'Let us ensure that by next May's election the SNP reaches a level which has never been seen before in any political party in the history of Scottish politics - 100,000 members to argue for the national cause.'

He also said the nationalists should set out to win 'our first UK general election in Scotland' in less than six months' time.

To help achieve that, he said the party should be 'open and generous', and allow 'some shining stars of the Yes movement to stand under the SNP banner'.
