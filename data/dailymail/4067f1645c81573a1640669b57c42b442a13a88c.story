Lewis Hamilton is hoping his Italian Grand Prix victory has provided him with a launchpad to again reel in Nico Rosberg - but is wary of Mercedes’ technical gremlins returning to haunt him.

Hamilton put behind him the furore of his feud with Rosberg two weeks previously in Belgium to take a much-needed chequered flag at Monza on Sunday.

With six races remaining and 175 points up for grabs, Hamilton now trails Rosberg by 22 points, which may appear a slender margin but he knows there can be no room for error or further issues.

Already this season Hamilton has suffered from a cylinder failure in the opening race in Australia, brake failures in Canada and Germany and a fuel leak that caused a fire in Hungary.

Even in Italy it was not plain sailing as he sat out most of second practice with an electrical issue, and then off the line his launch was hampered by another technical problem, whilst Rosberg has had gearbox issues at Silverstone and in final practice on Saturday.

'I’d like to think this win is a platform, but I have no idea what’s going to happen forwards from here,' said Hamilton.

'Over the weekend I had quite a few problems, missed almost a whole session in P2, then in qualifying in Q2 the car wouldn’t start again, but fortunately it did.

'As for the start sequence (at the beginning of the race), it could have been a lot worse. That was the best it could ever be considering I didn’t have the launch.'

Asked as to whether the power balance had again shifted in the wake of his win, Hamilton replied: 'Potentially, maybe. Time will tell.

'But these problems just keep popping up. Paddy (Lowe, executive technical director) said "It’s just so unlucky, with all the engines it just keeps happening to yours".

'Hopefully we’ll rectify them. Right now, I’m just looking forward, head down, and I see no reason why I can’t be as fast moving forwards.'

Rosberg’s double mistake into the first chicane, the second of which came when he was being pressured by Hamilton and cost him the win, seemed to suggest he could be starting to crack under the strain of the title fight.

It has offered up further hope to Hamilton, although Rosberg is still in pole position given he has a lead to defend.

'You can be relaxed when you’ve a cushion like that,' added Hamilton.

'He’s still got 20-odd points hasn’t he? Jeez, if I had that and even if things didn’t go well, that’s all right. That’s probably where he is (in his head).

'Of course, it’s not easy for anyone to be under pressure, and especially when I’m pressuring someone.

'Even for me, it’s hard when you have Fernando (Alonso) pressuring you, or (Sebastian) Vettel. That’s just the way it is.

'I’m sure if it was the other way around it would have been very hard for me to have kept him behind. It’s just the way it goes.

'Of course it (the win) is just a general positive, a big positive, and a step up the massive staircase I have to face.'
