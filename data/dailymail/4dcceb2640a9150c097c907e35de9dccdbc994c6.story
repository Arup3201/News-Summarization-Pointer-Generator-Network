A cashpoint filler was forced to call 999 after getting trapped inside an ATM while loading it with money.

Firefighters spent more than two hours trying to free the worker after he accidentally became trapped in a security room behind the device at a petrol station in Brentwood, Essex.

Crews had to verify the identity of the trapped security guard before calling in a specialist search and rescue team to help with the incident at Shell Service Station on Saturday lunchtime.

The specially-trained officers used heavy-duty cutting equipment to dismantle the front of the outside cash machine and free the man, who was trapped for more than two hours.  

Essex County Fire and Rescue Service said the man, who worked for Greenteam Services Ltd, suffered no injuries in the rescue.

Pream Kumar, manager of the petrol station, said he tried to help free the man after realising he had become stuck but his efforts were to no avail.

He said: ‘I was inside the office and my staff said a man had got stuck in the machine.

‘I went outside and I could hear he was trying to open the door from the inside so I tried to pull it but it wouldn’t go.

‘He was talking to his colleague who had been waiting outside of the cash machine for him while he loaded it with cash.

‘He told me he opened the door and went in to change the money and then suddenly the door wouldn’t reopen open.

‘It’s a very busy garage because of the M25 and being on the outskirts of Brentwood so lots of people were coming in and asking why the cashpoint was closed and what was going on. I didn’t know what to tell them.

‘It’s the first time I’ve seen anything like this.’

Mr Kumar said the worker eventually called the fire service and firefighters were forced to dismantle part of the ATM to free him.

He said: ‘They had to break the door. They’ve put a cover over it now so the cashpoint still isn’t working. There’s just a sign saying it’s out of order.

‘I don’t know when they’ll be back to fix it.’

A spokesman for Essex County Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘Firefighters were called to rescue a security guard who got trapped while loading up a cash point machine at a Shell petrol station.

‘The Securicor officer had gone into the security room behind the machine and got locked in.

‘After verifying his identity, firefighters set to work to free him.

‘ECFRS' Urban Search and Rescue team were brought in with specialist heavy duty cutting equipment to assist a crew from Brentwood.

‘Firefighters eventually gained entry and the guard was released by 2pm unharmed.’
