Wales winger Hal Robson-Kanu provided was forced to strip down to his briefs and change his shorts during the 2-0 defeat against Holland at the Amsterdam Arena.

Robson-Kanu's shorts had torn during an aerial challenge with Holland's Daryl Janmaat in the 28th minute leaving the player with no choice but to change.

Eager to stay on the pitch and help his country, Robson-Kanu quickly changed on the touchline in front of manager Chris Coleman, giving fans more than they had bargained for.

The decision didn't help Wales though, as they went behind to an Arjen Robben goal minutes later and eventually lost 2-0.

Despite this Coleman will have been happy with the performance of his young Wales side, especially as they were missing both Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.

He said afterwards: ‘You never like to lose but I don’t think we could have one much more. We put the effort in and we were up against a really good outfit with a top manager.  We showed courage, bravery and stayed strong and we gave them a really good test before they head off to the World Cup.’

You're pants: The Reading player then had to make a quick change on the touchline

Bum note: Robson-Kanu may not have seen the funny side but the Dutch fans did
