Benefit fraudsters: Gaye and Glyn Williams leave Gloucester Crown Court

A middle-class couple who claimed thousands of pounds in state benefits had enough money to privately educate their son, a court heard.

Gaye Williams, 38, pretended she was a single mother and claimed council housing and tax benefits as well as income support while her husband, Glyn, was earning as much as £1,500 a week.

At an earlier hearing at Gloucester Crown Court, she admitted three offences of obtaining benefits by dishonestly failing to disclose that her husband was living with her.

Mr Williams pleaded guilty to three offences of possessing criminal property - benefit money which was claimed by his wife and paid into his account.

They appeared in court again on Friday after Judge Jamie Tabor had given them six months to save up to repay a significant part of the loss of more than £11,500 - and avoid prison sentences.

The court was told that Mr Williams, 47, was in a position to repay £2,500 to the Department of Works and Pensions but Mrs Williams had been unable to work since the matter came to court - and was living on reduced benefits.

The couple, formerly of Oakle Street, Churcham, Gloucestershire, were now living apart, said Sabhia Pathan, for Mr Williams.

He had worked 'extremely hard' to save money towards repayment, she said.

Steve Young, for Mrs Williams, said she had been unable to work since the case came to court and the benefits she receives did not meet her outgoings.

Mr Young said she had been effectively blacklisted and could not get a job because of 'grossly inaccurate press reports.'

Judge Tabor told Mr Williams that he had been working extremely hard and had done all that he could have expected to earn money to repay the loss.

He said he should ensure that the payment is made to the Department of Work of Pensions by September 11 and that way avoid a prison sentence.

The judge ordered that a pre-sentence report be prepared on Mrs Williams.

He adjourned the case until September 11, when the couple will be sentenced.

At
an earlier hearing, the court was told that the couple were maintaining
a common household, despite Mrs Williams claiming she was a single 
mother.

Mrs Williams ran two cars, one of them a
4x4 and the couple bought an expensive Dogue de Bordeaux dog (file picture) - which 
cost about £1,000 and paid for their son to go to a private school

Mrs Williams ran two cars, one of them a
4x4 and the couple bought an expensive Dogue de Bordeaux dog - which 
cost about £1,000 - and paid for their son to go to a private school 
while she was claiming benefits.

The court was told the total of 
benefits paid by the Department of Work and Pensions, Gloucester City 
Council and Tewkesbury Borough Council was £11,558.

Mrs
Williams had claimed housing and council tax benefit while living in 
Soren Larsen Way, Hempsted, Gloucester, between November 2008 and 
January 2009.

She had then claimed similar benefits from Tewkesbury Council while living in Highnam between March and August 2009.

She had also failed to declare that for a short period she worked for an osteopath, earning almost £800.

Throughout the period, her husband was in well paid employment as an engineer and his earnings were as high as £1,000 to £1,500 a week.
