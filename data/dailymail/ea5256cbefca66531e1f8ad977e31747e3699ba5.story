A teenage murderer hanged himself just days after being jailed at one of Britain’s highest security prisons.

Imran Douglas, 18, faced a minimum of 18 years behind bars for the horrific killing of a bed-ridden pensioner.

His victim Margery Gilbey, 88, was found covered in blood at her sheltered accommodation in Shadwell, East London, earlier this year.

Douglas, a convicted thief who had been expelled from six schools, was sentenced to life by an Old Bailey judge earlier this month.

But five days later, guards entered his cell at Belmarsh Prison in South East London and discovered his body.

Family members initially suspected he may have been the victim of an attack after being targeted by other prisoners.

But the Met confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances and the case has been passed to a coroner.

A post mortem investigation found he died of injuries consistent with suicide by hanging.

Douglas strangled and stabbed Mrs Gilbey, known as Madge, in the neck before ransacking her room and leaving her to die.

He deliberately targeted his defenceless victim, a former café cook described as an ‘old-fashioned East Ender’.

The previous day he visited the care home and talked his way inside by pretending to be the grandson of another resident.

After fatally wounding her he rummaged through her drawers with blood on his hands before running off when a nurse arrived.

Mrs Gilbey's son Alan, 55, from nearby Bethnal Green, arrived with her favourite fish and chip supper just as staff were raising the alarm.

In an emotional tribute, he said she the 'kindest most gentle person' who was liked by everyone she met. He added: 'I can’t believe what has happened.’

Detectives identified Douglas from CCTV images and arrested him at the children's home where he lived the same day.

There they found his clothes covered in blood in a laundry basket and a bag on his bed which had the pensioner’s blood on it.

Sentencing him, Judge John Bevan QC said the murder was ‘wholly gratuitous’ and a crime at the ‘top end of the scale of gravity’.

‘You used a knife to attack a defenceless and vulnerable old lady in the privacy of her own home, on premises you must have seen to be sheltered accommodation,’ he said.

A Met spokesman confirmed that police are investigating the death of Douglas.

He said: ‘A special post-mortem examination gave cause of death as injuries consistent with self-suspension. The death is being treated as non-suspicious.’

A  Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Imran Douglas was found unresponsive in his cell by prison staff around 9.20am on Wednesday November 13.

‘Prison staff attempted CPR and paramedics attended but he was pronounced dead at 9.45am.

‘As with all deaths in custody, the Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.’
