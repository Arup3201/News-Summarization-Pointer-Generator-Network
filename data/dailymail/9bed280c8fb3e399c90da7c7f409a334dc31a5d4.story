The Scottish independence referendum is still two days away, but the blame game has already begun.

With the race still neck-and-neck, David Cameron is at pains to stress that other party leaders in Westminster backed his decision to give Alex Salmond his historic vote on separation.

Amid claims those around the Prime Minister ignored warnings about the chance of Yes vote, Downing Street insiders insisted the campaign would be won and lost on Labour votes.

David Cameron faces being the Prime Minister who oversaw the break-up of the Union, with critics claiming he left it too late to deliver the passion seen in last night's speech in Aberdeen

Mr Cameron today joined Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg in signing a joint 'vow' to devolve more powers to Scotland. 

But critics say the offer should have been made earlier, with some saying so-called Devo-Max should have been an option on the ballot paper in Thursday's vote.

One former minister told The Times: 'It's 'essay crisis' politics. This is the worst example but it's part of a pattern. The whole thing has been a total shambles.'

Last night Mr Cameron sought to deflect criticism of the decision to offer only a straight yes-no vote.

He told BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it was right to have one question, because of course if Scotland wants more devolution, and I think Scotland wants more devolution, you have to answer the prior question: Do you want to stay in the UK?

'Of course that wasn't just my view, that was the view of the leaders of other UK parties who all thought it was important, let's settle the question of separation and then look at devolution.

'In this campaign the individual parties have set out their proposals, they've been quite strikingly similar, so it's been possible to make progress.'

The Financial Times today reported claims that senior civil servants raised the alarm about the risks of the break-up of the UK.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his predecessor Lord O'Donnell are both said to have been concerned about the threat posed by the Yes campaign.

Government sources say it is up to Labour heavyweights like Gordon Brown, giving a speech in Clydebank today, to secure victory for the No campaign

Early in the referendum campaign, Sir Jeremy is said to have told ministers to make efforts to win over Yes voters, the newspaper reported.

The Cabinet Office said this was 'simply not true', adding that the government's focus had been 'entirely on getting to the right outcome. Ministers and the civil service have worked hard to make the case for the UK'.

Mr Cameron last night made his tenth and final trip to Scotland of the campaign, urging voters not to plunge the Union into a 'painful divorce'.

He appeared teary-eyed as he issued his most emotional plea yet to voters ahead of Thursday's historic referendum: 'Please don't break this family apart.'

But behind the scenes, aides admit the speech is likely to have little impact on the result.

Some 99 per cent of Tories in Scotland are planning to vote No, according to some polls, and Mr Cameron's is deeply unpopular outside his own party.

While the battle is being played out in Scotland, the implications of a Yes vote could have dire consequences in Westminster

Instead the biggest group being targeted by both sides in the campaign is working-class Labour supporters in the west of Scotland.

Labour big beasts including Gordon Brown, John Reid, Ed Miliband and Alistair Darling have hit the campaign trail hard in recent days, after polls show support for independence among labour voters had almost doubled to 30 per cent. 

'There is a real battle going on for Labour votes, and it is down to Labour to win it,' said a government source.

'It could all come down to 30 square miles and Glasgow, and it is up to Ed Miliband to deliver his voters for us.'

Mr Cameron's passionate speech last night, which followed a similarly teary-eyed address in Edinburgh last week, has been well received.

But many observers argued the same passion should have been shown much earlier in the campaign, with thousands of postal votes already cast.

But Mr Cameron against sought to deflect criticism from his role as Prime Minister in the campaign.

He told the BBC: 'It's not a campaign of the Conservative party against the SNP - it's a campaign of all of those parties and trade unions and voluntary bodies and charities and people who have nothing to do with politics who want Scotland to stay part of our family of nations and those who want us to leave.'
