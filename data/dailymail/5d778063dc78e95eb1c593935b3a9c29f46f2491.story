A luxurious doomsday bunker complex designed to comfortably survive any apocalypse has sold out all of its condos - despite the fact that prices range from $1.5 to $3million.

The Survival Condo Project is a luxury complex housed 15 storeys below ground in a former missile silo near Concordia, in Kansas.

It is designed to comfortably survive any apocalyptic disaster such as global health pandemics, cataclysmic weather and terror attacks, including a nuclear one.

The condos are equipped with all the amenities and resources that its residents need to survive for around five years

The missile silo was originally built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1960s for the Atlas F missile, and there were 72 of them around the country. 

The walls of the silo, constructed out of epoxy-hardened concrete, are 9 feet thick and designed to survive a direct nuclear strike. 

The dome structure that covers the silo cap can withstand winds in excess of 500 mph.

The survival condos are designed to hold up to 70 people and have enough resources to keep them alive for years, as they wait for the dust to settle.

A single condo is nearly 2,000-square-foot in size and cost anywhere from $1.5 to $3 million. 

Larry Hall, the brainchild behind the project, says that the condos are already sold out, but he is currently working on a second.

The condos are equipped with a number of modern amenities including flat-screen TVs, pools, theater, workout area, classrooms and library, and a minor surgery center. 

Each residential unit is provisioned with a five-year supply of freeze-dried and dehydrated survival food per person. 

The facility has a military grade security system that includes infrared cameras, proximity sensors, trip sensors, and passive detectors

Power for the complex is provided by the local electric grid, with a backup large wind turbine, and a diesel generator, while water is provided from redundant sources and purified for consumption

In addition, they have a hydroponic garden where they plan to grow 70 varieties of fruits and vegetables and there is a fish farm where they will raise tilapia.

The air supply for the entire facility is filtered by Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical filters, and the physical air intakes are protected by blast valves that prevent an overpressure air wave created by a nearby explosion from entering the facility and killing those inside.

The Survival Condo Project is not the only one of its kind. Elsewhere around the US, privately owned bunkers in decommissioned military sites are creeping up as a new breed of wealthy survivalist are emerging

On the security aspect, the facility has a military grade security system that includes infrared cameras, proximity sensors, microphones, trip sensors, and passive detectors. 

Numerous levels of blast doors are designed to withstand sizable explosives protect the facility's entrance.
