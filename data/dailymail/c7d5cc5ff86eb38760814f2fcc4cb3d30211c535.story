He's ONE of our greatest stars, a Golden Globe and Bafta winner whose movies have made millions worldwide. When he appeared as the adorably self-deprecating lead in Four Weddings And A Funeral 17 years ago, Britain fell in love with him.

With subsequent hits such as Notting Hill and Bridget Jones under his belt, you would have thought Hugh Grant might be enjoying the laurels of success and have found contentment now he's 50.

Clearly he hasn't. This week, as he toured TV stations fulminating self-righteously over the phone-hacking scandal, he came across as someone who is utterly embittered and jaundiced with life.

Seen here on Question Time, Hugh Grant has toured TV stations fulminating self-righteously over the phone-hacking scandal

Of course, we are all appalled by the News of the World's illegal activities, particularly the sickening evidence that the newspaper tampered with Milly Dowler's mobile after she had disappeared.

But the relish with which Grant is dancing on the grave of a newspaper with a 168-year history, which despite its smut can be proud of many fine and important investigations into corruption, doesn't do him justice.

The death of any paper diminishes our democracy, but then have you noticed that the most vociferous critics of the British Press are invariably those whose rackety private lives have been exposed by it? Step forward that buffoon John Prescott, whose long and lurid affair with his secretary Tracey Temple abused the high office he held.

And, inevitably, the former chief of the world's motor-racing federation, Max Mosley, who's best known for indulging in spanking and sex sessions with prostitutes dressed in German uniforms.

How gleefully they now denounce the newspaper that exposed them.

Meanwhile, Tony Blair's lying former communications chief, Alastair Campbell, who sexed up the case for the disastrous war in Iraq, has been just as vociferous.

But what's really puzzling is the hatred Mr Grant feels for the popular Press, which arguably gave him the publicity over the years and created the fanbase that enabled him to earn such vast sums.

Is it possible that his antipathy goes back to the revelations of that night in 1995 when LA police found him receiving oral sex from hooker Divine Brown?

I hope not. Mr Grant should be above that.

Jennifer Aniston: Risque flights of fantasy

In her latest turkey, Horrible Bosses, Jennifer Aniston plays a sex-mad dentist.

'I
loved the script. I thought it was an extremely unique idea that 
everybody universally would be able to relate to, having a boss that's a
little bit difficult.'

I 
don't know which offices she's ever worked in, but I've never had a boss
try to seduce me semi-naked, bra-less with stockings and suspenders.

MPs and 
members of the England women's World Cup football team have put pressure
on the BBC to change its prime-time schedules today to show their 
quarter-final clash with France.

So
let me say, as a member of their sex, that despite their dedication and
skill, women footballers have about as much spectator appeal as a 
transsexual angling competition.

I'd change my mind if anyone I knew could name a single player in the side.

Perhaps the greatest hypocrite of all
is Labour leader Ed Miliband. While calling for the PM to apologise for
appointing Andy Coulson — who was arrested yesterday — his own director
of communications, Tom Baldwin, has been accused of being involved in 
'a number of infringements of the law'.

These allegations by former Tory Treasurer Michael Ashcroft involve accessing private bank accounts while he was on The Times.

Miliband
said he asked Baldwin, who, incidentally, is said to have snorted 
cocaine, if there was anything in his past that should prevent him 
taking the job. He gave him his word there was not. That's just what 
Cameron asked Coulson.

How
sickening that the world's first IVF lottery to 'win a baby' is to be 
launched in Britain. Anyone can win — man, woman, single, gay — and get 
£25,000 worth of free IVF treatment.

When
every piece of research confirms that children from single-parent homes
are disadvantaged in all kinds of way, trivialising parenthood in this 
way is morally indefensible.

Emma: Sad goodbyes

As the curtain falls on the final Harry Potter movie, the delectable Emma Watson seems to be constantly in floods of tears.

The actress says she is in the middle of a 'grieving process' at being separated from her film character, Hermione.

Or is she just grieving for the Harry Potter cash cow that has amassed her a £24 million fortune?

And while we're on fortunes, with all her billions you'd have thought J.K. Rowling could have turned up on the red carpet for her finale hurrah in a dress that didn't look as though she'd been dragged backwards though a clump of peonies in full flower.

With only days to go before she has her baby girl by Caesarean section, Victoria Beckham says she's not one of those celebrities who wants to be photographed like Demi Moore on a Vanity Fair cover with her naked bump.

Instead, her naked bump is 'secretly' snapped by hubby David and the photographs are posted online. At this rate we'll be treated to a video of the birth on YouTube.

It was reported that Fergie whispered to a male friend during a charity ball: 'I know what all the headlines will be tomorrow. Who is the Duchess's mystery date?'

A word of advice, Fergie: no one thinks of you as a 'duchess' any more — just a pathetic, publicity-seeking, disgraced former royal.

Equally, no one could care less about who has the misfortune of squiring a dumpy, middle-aged woman who possesses not one iota of self-knowledge.

A company investigating people's attitudes towards domestic appliances reports the dishwasher is the least trusted. Rubbish! It's not the dishwasher that's the problem — rather our partners who don't know how to stack them properly.

Number 10 has secret plans to dispatch the treacherous Labour-leaning Speaker Bercow to Afghanistan as part of a parliamentary exchange. Bercow in a burkah — I'd pay good money to witness that, especially since burkah-clad Afghan women are not expected to be seen or heard.

Home Secretary Theresa May plans a change to the law to stop criminals using their 'right to a family life' under the Human Rights Act to prevent them being deported. One Bolivian used the fact he owns a British cat as part of his successful case that he should be allowed to stay here. Let's hope this latest promise of reform isn't as empty as the PM's vow to scrap the reviled Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.

Effete and ineffectual multi-millionaire Zac Goldsmith attacks the News International empire run by Rupert Murdoch and his son James as being too powerful. That's pretty rich coming from a former non-dom who inherited £200 million to £300 million from his billionaire father — who incidentally also hated the Press — and has never achieved anything in life off his own back.
