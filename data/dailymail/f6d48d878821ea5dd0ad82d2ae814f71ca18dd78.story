Investigation: Katie Bowman has alleged that the force harassed her after she split with PC Ash

A graduate who claims to be the victim of a police harassment campaign was allowed to access the Police National Computer during patrol car rides with her former boyfriend.

Katie Bowman was just 18 when she was allowed to make checks on number plates and even file reports of cars that had been stopped during the jaunts with a serving officer, PC Alexander Ash.

In other incidents, she alleges that she and PC Ash handcuffed each other to a desk at a police station and that she wore his body armour.  

Forensic science graduate Miss Bowman, now 24, has already alleged that officers at Thames Valley Police have made her life a misery after she split with PC Ash, stopping her more than 70 times for alleged offences. 

She claims to have been targeted because she had broken up with PC Ash after finding out he had another girlfriend. 

Until last night, the force had sought to downplay the allegations but it has now launched an inquiry into them.

But yesterday it responded to revelations that PC Ash, 31, took Miss Bowman on ‘ride-alongs’ in his patrol car and even let her request searches on the heavily restricted PNC.

Counter claim: PC Alexander Ash at his wedding in May

Miss Bowman says for the next two years after she split up with PC Ash she was breath tested 70 times during a campaign of harassment

His activities had been exposed by an internal probe in 2008 but he escaped with a fine and reprimand for misconduct.

Last
night Thames Valley Deputy Chief Constable Francis Habgood apologised, 
admitting ‘it would appear that the conduct of a few officers has fallen
short’.

He confirmed that PC Ash had been disciplined in 2008, prompted
by Miss Bowman’s complaints, and he suggested the officer could now 
lose his job.

Mr 
Habgood said: ‘These officers behaved in a totally unacceptable way. 
Were this to happen today I strongly believe the outcome would be very 
different.’ 

Documents from
an internal investigation, obtained by Miss Bowman and seen by the 
Mail, describe a recording of Miss Bowman requesting information on the 
PNC and filling out forms on behalf of PC Ash.

Miss Bowman said: ‘Alex used to be on patrol on his own so I used to meet him and spend the rest of the shift in the car. He would let me wear his body armour, hat and belt. 

‘I would do the vehicle checks over the radio and write out the forms for him.’

Miss Bowman, who has never been convicted of a crime, says for the next two year after she split up with PC Ash she was breath tested 70 times during a campaign of harassment by his colleagues.

Complaint: Katie Bowman claims her life was made a misery

Despite never securing a conviction 
against her, Miss Bowman said the officers filed up to 40 damning 
intelligence reports which saw her fired from two jobs and rejected from
a third after Criminal Records Bureau checks.

PC Ash claimed earlier this week that he was ‘never in a relationship’ with Miss Bowman and only met her twice.

Miss Bowman, now pregnant and engaged, claims she was also forced to flee her home in Marlow and move to Bedfordshire.

She said: ‘As soon as I moved it all miraculously stopped. And even though it has, I’m having to try to clear my name because I’m terrified for the future, I can’t get a job.’ 

Miss Bowman has the support of her local MP, Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who has branded the damaging files on her as ‘utterly trivial’.

Thames Valley Police removed almost half of the 40 intelligence reports after a review. The remainder will be reviewed once again in the latest probe.

Deputy Chief Constable Habgood said last night: ‘It is essential that the people we serve can have absolute trust and confidence in us to conduct ourselves with integrity and professionalism at all times.

'It would appear that in this case the conduct of a few officers has fallen short of this.’ 

Welcoming the review, Miss Bowman said: ‘I’m happy they’ve agreed to investigate this but it is long overdue.’
