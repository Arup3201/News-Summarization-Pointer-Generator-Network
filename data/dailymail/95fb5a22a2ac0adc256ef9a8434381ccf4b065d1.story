The creeping paralysis began in Emily Thompson’s hands and feet and eventually became so complete that she could not speak or move her eyelids.

But the former dancer has astonished doctors by recovering in weeks from a rare medical condition which left her helpless and in intensive care.

Miss Thompson, 20, was diagnosed with the disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome, which affects one in 50,000 people and attacks the lining of the nerves. It is so serious that one in five patients never make a full recovery.

Emily Thompson (pictured with her mother, Carolyn) was left unable to move after developing the nerve condition Guillain-Barré syndrome - it causes the immune system to attack the nerves resulting in paralysis

Her family was devastated  when she 
developed pneumonia and spent five weeks on a ventilator and a further 
two weeks in intensive care.

But this week, after a total of  only ten weeks in hospital, Miss Thompson was able to take her first two steps.

‘Being unable to move was terrifying,’ she said. ‘I thought I could not take any more. I wanted to die.

‘But after five weeks the feeling started to return to my face, and slowly I was able to speak again.

Ms Thompson (pictured with her sister, Victoria, and brother, Michael) spent ten weeks in hospital. For seven weeks she was in intensive care and developed pneumonia meaning it was feared she might not survive

Ms Thompson (pictured before she fell ill) was diagnosed after noticing her hands and feet had gone numb. She has now taken her first steps and is finally being released from hospital

‘I
 am starting to take my first steps, and doctors say I will make a full 
recovery. To say I am relieved would be an understatement.’

Miss
 Thompson, of Newton Hall, near Durham, first realised something was 
wrong in August, when she developed a numb feeling in her hands and 
feet.

A few days later she was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome and taken into hospital.

Her
 family, including her mother Carolyn, 51, father David, 49, sister 
Victoria, 29, and brother Michael, 27, kept a bedside vigil.

Soon
 Miss Thompson, who is studying to become a social worker at Sunderland 
University, could not move a single part of her body.

Ms Thompson (pictured before her illness) will now spend time in rehabilitation learning how to walk again. She says that for a while she believed she would not ever be able to walk again

Ms Thompson said: 'There were 10 days when I couldn't remember anything. I just didn't know what was real or what was a dream'

She
 went into a dream-like state for ten days, having hallucinations that 
she was a Big Brother contestant and that her father had won the 
lottery.

After seven weeks in intensive care, Miss Thompson’s condition improved and she began to regain feeling in her body.

She
 said: ‘I just wanted to cry when I started to move. It was so 
overwhelming because I thought it was never going to happen.’ 

Guillain-Barré
 syndrome occurs when the immune system attacks the nerves. Most 
patients develop it shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection.
 Treatments target the antibodies in the blood that are attacking the 
nerves.

Ms Thompson (pictured before her illness) does not remember very much from her time in hospital so her oler sister, Victoria, has written her a diary of her time in intensive care

Guillain-Barré  syndrome is an autoimmune disease which affects just one in 50,000 people in the UK.

Symptoms, including pain, tingling and numbness, begin in the feet and hands and move into the arms and legs.

It can also cause muscle weakness, co-ordination problems, paralysis and even death.

The exact cause is not known, but most people develop the syndrome after a viral or bacterial infection.

It attacks the peripheral nervous system - the network of nerves outside the central nervous system, including the motor nerves, used by the brain to control muscles.

Around 20 per cent of people never recover fully from the syndrome.
