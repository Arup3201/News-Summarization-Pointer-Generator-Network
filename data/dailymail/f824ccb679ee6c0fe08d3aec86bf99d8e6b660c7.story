Atletico Madrid have reported that striker Mario Mandzukic broke his nose during Tuesday's 3-2 loss at Olympiacos in their Champions League Group A opener.

The Spanish club said that the Croatian international will have surgery on this nose on Thursday.

Mandzukic will almost certainly miss Saturday's La Liga encounter with Celta Vigo and could be out for as long as two weeks making him a doubt for Atletico's now crucial second Champions League game at home to Italian side Juventus on 1 October.

The 28-year-old was elbowed in the face by Olympiacos midfielder Pajtim Kasami in the opening minutes of the match.

After being attended by the team's medical staff, he returned to the field, heading in Atletico's first goal before half-time.

Mandzukic has scored three goals in all competitions for his new side since his off-season move  from Bayern Munich.
