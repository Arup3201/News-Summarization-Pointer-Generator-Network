A billionaire Saudi royal has lost a High Court fight with a Jordanian businesswoman after a judge described his evidence 'confusing and too unreliable'.

Businessman Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud became embroiled in a dispute with Daad Sharab after selling an airliner to former Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

Consultant Mrs Sharab helped broker the deal and sued the wealthy owner of the Savoy hotel in London claiming he owed her about £6.5million commission for the part she played.

Unsatisfactory: A judge branded Prince Al-Waleed's evidence 'confusing and unreliable'. Right, consultant Daad Sharab, who is owed £6.5million by the prince following her successful claim

Although the prince disagreed, Judge Mr Justice Peter Smith today ruled against him.

Mrs Sharab had said Prince Al-Waleed agreed to pay the commission in 2005 following a meeting in Col Gaddafi's tent in Libya.

Prince Al-Waleed had disputed her claim, at a trial in London earlier this summer, and denied that any agreement was made for a 'specific commission'.

Judge Smith said the dispute turned on whose evidence he accepted and that he had 'overwhelmingly concluded' that he preferred Mrs Sharab's case.

He said: 'At the end of the day I simply found his (Prince Al-Waleed) evidence confusing and too unreliable and Mrs Sharab's was more credible on any dispute of fact between them.

'Having seen the prince in the witness box and the evidence he gave, I found his evidence completely unsatisfactory.

'His memory had clearly gone as regards the detail of any of these transactions. His attempts to bolster that defect in the witness box were frankly pathetic and he demonstrated great amounts of confusion.'

Judge Smith added: 'It is not necessary for me to determine that he was telling lies in the witness box. He came close to admitting it.'

Mr Justice Peter Smith pointed out the prince was one of the richest men on the planet.

'The front cover of his autobiography
published in 2005 refers to his being the fifth richest man in the 
world,' added Judge Smith.

'He has an estimated fortune of over $20billion with extensive and substantial business interests throughout the world.'

After the ruling, Mrs Sharab said that she was relieved at the outcome.

She added: 'Today's decision has reinforced my belief in the fairness and impartiality of the English courts.'

The prince now plans to appeal.

A spokesman said: 'The
court has not undertaken a balanced assessment of all the evidence and 
has been unduly swayed by the judge's own view regarding Prince 
Al-Waleed's business negotiations with the government of Col Muammar 
Gaddafi to secure full payment for his aircraft after Gaddafi had 
reneged on agreements with him.

'Prince Al-Waleed believes today's ruling is wrong and is not an accurate analysis of all of the evidence before the court.'

Reneged: Prince Al-Waleed claimed the former Libyan dictator Col Muammar Gadaffi had failed to stick to a business agreement between them
