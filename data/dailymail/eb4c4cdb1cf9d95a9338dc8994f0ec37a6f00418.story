The food fraud scandal escalated last night when Tesco admitted the ‘minced beef’ in its frozen bolognese is up to 100 per cent horsemeat.

The value range ready-meal was made by Comigel, a French firm also linked to contaminated products at Findus and Aldi.

Horses slaughtered in Romania are thought to have been used by Comigel to make meals distributed across Britain and Europe, raising fears the problems are more widespread than first thought.

Contaminated: The Everyday Value spaghetti bolognese was found last week to contain up to 100% horse

The Tesco revelation came as:

Tim Smith, Tesco’s technical director, yesterday apologised to customers over the latest development.

He said: ‘A week ago Tesco withdrew a frozen Everyday Value spaghetti bolognese product from sale.

‘We did this as a precaution because Findus products from the same factory were reportedly at risk of containing horsemeat.

‘Since then, we have carried out a number of tests on the product and those tests identified the presence of horse DNA.

Owen Paterson, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, updated ministers about the investigation into horsemeat contamination

Of the positive results, most are at a trace level of less than 1 per cent but three showed significant levels of horse DNA, exceeding 60 per cent.’

Asked what the true level was, the company said the horse meat ranged between 60 and 100 per cent.

There have been concerns that the horse meat used in burgers, lasagne and bolognese sold in the UK is contaminated with veterinary drugs, such as bute.

Bute is banned from the human food chain because it can cause aplastic anaemia, which is a type of leukaemia.

Mr Smith said Tesco’s test for bute was clear, adding that the company would not take food from Comigel’s facility again.

The revelations show Tesco has been stocking products containing horse meat from two different European sources.

The scandal emerged four weeks ago following the revelation of contamination of burgers made by manufacturers in Ireland.

The French authorities say the horse meat itself came from two Romanian abattoirs and arrived at the French company via brokers in Cyprus and Holland.

This explanation has been disputed by the Romanian prime minister, Victor Ponta, who angrily denied any suggestion that the food would have been sold as anything other than horse meat.

The Secretary of State for the 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Paterson, faced accusations 
that the Government has mishandled the crisis during a statement to MPs 
yesterday.

Ministers and the Food Standards 
Agency took three weeks before ordering comprehensive testing of 
processed beef products sold in the high street and served up in 
schools, hospitals, prisons and other public institutions.

Mr Paterson suggested the horse 
contamination was the result of an international criminal conspiracy and
 that police in Europe and the UK are involved in the investigation.

Withdrawn: Tesco says it instructs suppliers to only use Irish beef to make The Everyday Value Spaghetti Bolognese

Conspicuous absence: Retailers began a mass clear out of beef products linked to the horsemeat scandal

His Labour shadow, Mary Creagh, 
accused him and fellow ministers of incompetence and reported claims 
that up to 70,000 horses in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have been slaughtered over a five-year period and may
 have ended up on the dinner plates of unsuspecting families.

She added: ‘It is very convenient to 
blame the Poles and the Romanians but so far neither country have found 
any problems with their beef abattoirs.’

She said the lack of 
information from the Government had been a ‘disgrace’   and warned that 
the public’s confidence in the food chain was ‘sinking like a stone’.
