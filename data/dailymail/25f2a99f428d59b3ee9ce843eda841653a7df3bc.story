Frankie Dettori has been confirmed as rider of Ruler of the World in Sunday’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe.

The jockey had rejected the opportunity to ride defending champion Treve, whose trainer Criquette Head-Maarek insists would have been a better option for Dettori.

Dettori looked in danger of missing out on Europe’s top race when Head-Maarek requested he was replaced on the filly owned by his boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani by veteran Thierry Jarnet, the jockey on board when she won the 2013 Arc.

Since then Treve has registered her third defeat of the season in the Prix Vermeille with Dettori suggesting the 2014 model is a pale shadow of the 2013 one.

But Head-Maarek, who has expressed satisfaction with Treve’s preparation, told Agence France-Presse: ‘We will prove on Sunday he (Dettori) is wrong.

‘I don’t think she has gone mentally. She sweated before the Vermeille but then she did that before the Arc last year.

‘Mentally she is still strong, less so physically after her foot and back problems this year. I wouldn’t run her unless I thought she was mentally up for the challenge.’

Confirmation that Dettori would partner 2013 Investec Derby winner Ruler Of The World with Joseph O’Brien on stablemate Chicquita came after the duo emerged from their last serious work-outs at Aidan O’Brien’s Ballydoyle base.

Dettori opted against saddling last year's L'Arc winner Treve (pictured) to ride Ruler of the World 

O’Brien is set to have a third Arc challenger with Yorkshire Oaks winner Tapestry a planned 120,000 euro supplementary entry this morning. Ryan Moore will ride. 

Dettori, a three-time Arc winner, triumphed in last month’s Prix Foy on the colt over the Arc course and distance.

It will be a 26th ride in 27 years for the 43-year-old Italian, a sequence only interrupted by the broken ankle he suffered a year ago on Wednesday which cost him the winning ride on Treve.

Conditions of his recent part-purchase mean Dettori, successful on his boss’s impressive debutant Moheet at Salisbury, is also unable to ride Sheik Joaan’s third runner Ectot, with Gregory Benoist maintaining his partnership with the Prix Niel winner.

Both Ectot and Treve are shorter in the Arc betting than Ruler of The World but Harry Herbert, racing manager for Sheik Joaan, said the colt’s chances should not be underestimated.

Herbert added: ‘Ruler of The World is almost a forgotten horse but he won the Prix Foy well. A truly-run Arc is made for him.’

Richard Hughes hit the front in the jockeys’ championship for the first time with a double at Salisbury on Elysian Flyer and Musicora.

He now leads Ryan Moore by one (145-144).

Hughes said: ‘It is just a pleasure to go past the best jockey in the world. I know he is not trying (to be champion) but I am.’
