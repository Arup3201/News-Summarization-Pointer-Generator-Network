They recently fought it out for first place on Celebrity Big Brother and now Katie Hopkins and Katie Price will compete again this time for the title of Celebrity Mum of the Year.

The shortlist for Celebrity Mum of the Year 2015 has been announced today, with the British public nominating ten celebrities including the two Katies.

Price, who is a mother of five to Harvey, Junior, Princess Tiaamii, Jett and Bunny will be competing for her third title as Mum of the Year, where as Hopkins, who is a mother of three to India, Poppy and Maximillan, has never before been shortlisted.

As well as Price and Hopkins other mums taking pole position include Katie Piper, Abbey Clancy, X Factor winner Sam Bailey and TOWIE star Billie Faiers.

This year it seems stars of the small screen have also stolen the nation's heart – with This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby and The Voice co-host Emma Willis both securing a top spot. 

Unlike previous editions, only two professional singers made the final cut, with the 2015 top ten completed by Girls Aloud's Kimberley Walsh and The Saturdays' Frankie Bridge.

The lucky finalists combine for a grand total of 21 children. Katie Price  has been a mother the longest, with son Harvey aged 12, while Kimberley Walsh had her first child, son Bobby, just over 5 months ago.

New mum Billie Faiers has also been nominated for the prestigious award

A sign of the times, 2015 has seen reality trump Royalty hands-down with The Duchess of Cambridge narrowly missing out after finishing in eleventh place. 

However the most shocking entry to the list has to go to Marmite mum Katie Hopkins who has previously angered Brits with her controversial approach to parenting. 

The ex-apprentice star has previously claimed to filter her children's friends according to their names but her antics have seemingly struck a chord with Brits.

However, not everyone is thrilled with the decision with her nomination with many outraged members of the public taking to Twitter to express their disagreement.

Coleen Nolan's son Shane Richie Jnr tweeted: 'Sooo @KTHopkins has been nominated for mum of the year??? Is this a joke?? This pic says it all #baffled'

Leanne McGiveron added: 'How can a mum who teaches her children dispicable traits to be prejudice etc be nominated for mum of the year.'

However, despite some people's disapproval the list was chosen by the public rather than a professional panel, so the caustic business woman is obviously impressing some mothers.
