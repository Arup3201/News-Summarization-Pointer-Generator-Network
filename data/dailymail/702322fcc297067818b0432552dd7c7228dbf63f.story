World Cup year has begun. Just 260 days from now, hosts England will launch the 2015 tournament against Fiji at Twickenham.

The pool match is the first of 48 fixtures in an event that will break a multitude of records and potentially revolutionise the sport in these islands. Here, Sportsmail assesses the prospects of the home country, their nearest rivals, the other leading nations, and the event itself...

ENGLAND

Selection: The back line is still a work in progress and midfield is the primary conundrum, as per usual. When — if ever — all the candidates are fit, it is likely to be a simple equation: Manu Tuilagi plus another, with several men jostling to claim the No 12 shirt. Luther Burrell is the form option, Sam Burgess  the possible bolter. George Ford deserves to retain the fly-half berth for now, but Owen Farrell won’t quietly settle for the role of understudy.

Depth: England have a vast array of very good players, but few, if any, who would consistently belong in the world level, elite bracket. Stuart Lancaster needs his leading lights to make that leap this year, but the head coach knows he could field two Test-class packs to take on all comers. There are a multitude of pedigree English loosehead props, locks and flankers, scrum-halves and full-backs, but the coaches would like more tightheads and an out-and-out openside option.

Momentum: More needed, urgently. The national team were unable to claim the results they craved against the southern giants in the autumn, although victory over Australia at least laid down a strong marker against a pool rival. In the Six Nations, the priority will be a ‘statement’ win against another Pool A side, Wales, to bury the ghosts of the record 30-3 defeat in Cardiff two years ago. Yet, frankly, England require a title or a Grand Slam to give them a timely surge of belief and conviction.

Tactics: England are still in the development phase, when they need to be fine-tuning. An expansion of the game-plan in the 2014 Six Nations brought pace and dynamism to their play, as well as heartening results, but they were unable to beat New Zealand at their own deadly game during the summer. In the recent November campaign, the vital success against Australia was founded on traditional forward force. Lancaster’s men must acquire the valuable knack of adapting on the hoof.

Preparation: No stone will be left unturned. No expense will be spared. Lancaster is orchestrating a meticulous World Cup challenge based on the appliance of science and technology. England have adopted British Cycling’s ‘aggregate of marginal gains’ formula.

They will spend a fortnight in Colorado in July and they now have a state-of-the-art training facility on site at their Surrey HQ. If they don’t succeed, it won’t be due to a lack of planning.

WALES

Warren Gatland’s team have phenomenal potential, but not the results to mark them out as front-line World Cup contenders. Time will tell if the recent victory over South Africa will serve as a launch-pad for Welsh confidence levels.

The core of the line-up is well established and armed with crucial experience from the last World Cup and a glorious Lions campaign, while the likes of Rhys Webb, Samson Lee and Liam Williams have made a positive impact.

Webb and Dan Biggar appear capable of igniting a more high-tempo attacking game but Gatland must decide if it is right, at this late stage, to move away from the power-runner formula which has served him well — in Europe at least.

One negative is the loss of Scarlets hooker Emyr Phillips, who will undergo surgery on a dislocated shoulder and looks set to miss Wales’ Six Nations campaign.

Wales coach Warren Gatland must get his tactics right if his side are to mount a serious challenge 

THE CONTENDERS

No prizes for identifying the favourites. New Zealand are top of the world rankings by a street and keep finding ways to win even when they are being emphatically out-played. They have vast experience, nous and power, supreme skills and athleticism, and the greatest finisher in the game — Julian Savea.

South Africa have the size and enough quality to be a force and Australia will improve rapidly under Michael Cheika. The canny Kiwi, Joe Schmidt, has turned Ireland into Europe’s front-runners and although they have been mostly hopeless in recent years, don’t rule out a shock charge by France.

THE TOURNAMENT

This will be a slick event projected around the world. It will surpass all records for attendances, profits and TV ratings, but it must do more than that. Twickenham is already a victim of commercial overkill and those trying out the sport must not be submerged under a tide of logos and marketing slogans.

The tournament needs to have atmosphere and soul, not a sanitised, corporate feel. It needs Tier 2 nations to have full access to all their top players and it needs a massive logistical operation to ensure transport chaos does not blight the night games in particular. Make all that happen and it will be a wondrous carnival of rugby.

Twickenham will be among the 13 stadiums which will play host to the 2015 Rugby World Cup
