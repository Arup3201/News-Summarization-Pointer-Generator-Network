A hunter who received negative comments on Facebook after sharing photos of her next to a massive bear she killed has spoken out against her critics.

The two photos that Eva Shockey shared on Friday and Saturday were from a North Carolina hunting trip taken alongside her television presenter father father Jim Shockey. They both appear on 'Jim Shockey's Uncharted.' 

One of Shockey's photo captions says the  bear she killed weighed 510.2lbs. 

Her photographs have since received thousands of comments and sparked a heated debate between pro-hunting and anti-hunting supporters.

On Saturday, Shockey posted a selfie showing her with her dog and wrote 'An anti-hunter just told me, and I quote, to "kill that little worthless dog you have instead" of the bear I just hunted in NC. 

'Apparently hunting a bear, eating/donating all of the meat and putting money towards conservation is a bad thing, but killing my puppy is ok. If this logic isn't totally insane, I don't know what is.'

Hunter: Eva Shockey received criticism online after she posted images of a bear she killed

Controversy: The photos of Shockey with the dead bear have received thousands of comments and sparked a heated debate between pro-hunting and anti-hunting supporters

The online criticism aimed at Shockey, as well as her response over the user's alleged comment, were first reported by The Blaze. 

Among the thousands of comments posted online, one user wrote 'Such a beautiful animal shot dead for nothing but your pleasure , real nice, a real accomplishment you should be proud.'

Another said 'Bear killer! That bear has more beauty alive than dead! So sad, and y would u even want to pose in a pic like this?!'

Other commenters have congratulated Shockey for getting the bear and offered words of support. Multiple Facebook users have uploaded photos of animals they've killed while hunting.

'Stay strong girl there just trying to get u riled up .congrats beautiful bear,' one supporter wrote.

A different user said 'Congrats on your hunt...sorry for all the negative words from others...just stay the course.'

In a Monday interview with 'Fox and Friends' Shockey was asked about the 'sick' comments she received --  and responded 'It is sick, I agree with you. But unfortunately we actually have to deal with that quite a lot, so this comment particularly - I've never heard someone tell me to kill my puppy before, but comments like this - they definitely happen to us.'

On the program, Shockey also spoke about her father's advice to her for handling online commenters, saying 'if they say something hurtful like my dad should shoot me in the head - I mean, that happens, that's what they say - and I'm like "Oh my goodness" but he says "Stay above it, stay true to yourself and just show what you believe," and I believe with every part of me that what I'm doing is right, so there's nothing that I'm apologizing for. 

'So in that sense, I mean I'm not going to apologize to them, but I will say that I'd love to explain to them, I'd love to show them everyday what I do, that hunting is a good thing.'

Shockey also said during the 'Fox and Friends' interview 'I think the biggest thing as far as being a proud hunter is that what we're doing is a good thing and I mean we're raising, huge, huge, huge amounts of money for conservation every year, something the anti-hunters - they're fighting hunters. But when they're fighting hunters, technically they're just fighting us raising money for wildlife habitat and that's not really doing anything for them. I mean, it's backfiring.

'So, if they understood how much money we're putting into hunting, how in North Carolina specifically the hunt I was just on, the bear population and the human population, they're both rising really fast and obviously we're not going to get rid of the humans so at that point you have no choice, it's human nature, you need to make room for the humans to live there so you have to keep the bear population in check. 

'And if the hunters don't do it, then the bears are going to be increasing. There's highway collisions, there's huge, huge dollars in crop degradation every year, and if we don't do something the farmers are going to do it and it won't be as nice as the hunters and we won't be bringing in the money to this economy.'
