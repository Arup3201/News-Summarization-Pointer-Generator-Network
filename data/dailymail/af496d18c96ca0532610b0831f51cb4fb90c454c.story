A burglar chased away from a house by a 13-year-old schoolboy with a saw has been jailed after police found him cowering in a bush nearby.

'Extremely brave' Cameron Harrison, 13, was home alone in Worcester when he was woken by a noise outside his bedroom and realised the house was being burgled.

After the teenager used the saw to scare off the intruder and his accomplice Darren Dowie, who was keeping watch outside, police discovered Dowie hiding in a bush close to the property.

Brave: Schoolboy Cameron Harris, 13, chased off the burglar with a saw after coming face to face with the intruder while home alone in Worcester

Today Cameron told how, after he was woken by the noise, a strange man put 
his head around his door - prompting the fearless schoolboy to spring 
out of bed and pursue him through the house.

As he ran downstairs after the intruder, Cameron grabbed a saw which had been left on the landing by builders who were repairing the floor.

He found the man holding armfuls of his family's belongings - so raised the tool above his head and chased the burglar and an accomplice who was keeping watch outside of the house and down the street.

Cameron did not touch either of the men with the saw but simply used it to frighten them off.

After the man ran off the teenager ran back inside and phoned his mother Lisa Sawyer, 41, who called police.

'Proud': Cameron's mother said her son was a 'hero' after he chased away the intruder and his accomplice from their home

Dowie, 37, who had been waiting outside, was caught a short time later after being apprehended in his hiding place.

Yesterday Dowie was jailed for two years at Worcester Crown Court after he admitted burglary.

Judge Richard Rundell told the court Dowie had been caught thanks to the 'extremely brave' actions

Today Cameron told how he leapt into action when faced with the nightmare scenario.

'I woke up after I heard a loud noise outside my room, then this man put his head around my door,' he said.

'I said "who are you?" and he disappeared back on to the landing.

'So I pulled on my t-shirt and shorts and started to head downstairs, but before I did I grabbed a saw to protect myself.

'When
I got downstairs the man had loads of our belongings in his hands so I 
shouted to stop and just started chasing him out of the back door and 
down the garden path.

'I stopped when I go to the bottom of the garden and went back to phone mum and tell her what had happened.

'He was a bit taller than me so I felt quite scared but not as much as I thought I would.

'I was just angry he was in our house and I wanted to protect the family.

'I'd definitely do it again, a lot of my mates have said they think it's great but they don't think they could do what I did. I feel proud of what I did,' the 13-year-old said.

'Bit of luck': Cameron's mother Lisa Sawyer said it was lucky that builders had been repairing the floors and left the saw behind

'Angry': Describing his ordeal the teenager said he had felt 'quite scared', but that he 'wanted to protect the family'

Mother-of-two Ms Sawyer, who has moved away from the property since the burglary on May 25, said she was proud of her 'hero' son.

The deli assistant said: 'The thought of someone breaking in and going through all your things is horrible, but to actually be there when it happens must be terrifying.

'I was quite shocked when I heard what Cameron did, I thought he'd be scared but he held it together very well.

'It was a bit of luck that we were having the floors done at the time, I think the sight of him running downstairs holding a saw in his hands probably put them off a bit.

'He was a hero that day, I'm very proud of him,' his mother said.

A West Mercia Police spokesman said: 'The house in the Warndon area of Worcester was broken into after the offender removed a cat flap and reached through to unlock the door.

'Two laptops, a mobile phone, money boxes and jewellery were stolen but a 13-year-old boy who had been asleep in bed was woken and chased the offender through the house and into the back garden before he lost him in a nearby street.

'The boy's mother phoned 999 and less than an hour later Darren Dowie was arrestedby police hiding in bushes a short distance from the property.'

Detective Inspector Stuart Murphy of West Mercia Police said Cameron was 'extremely brave' to pursue a burglar, but added: 'We would not generally advise people to chase offenders as they may be dangerous and possibly armed with a weapon, but it is a judgement call and we recognise that the instinct of many victims will be to follow them.

'Although it is best to wait until the police arrive, in this case fortunately no-one was hurt and the quick thinking of the boy and his mother enabled us to make a speedy arrest, and return the majority of the stolen property to them.'
