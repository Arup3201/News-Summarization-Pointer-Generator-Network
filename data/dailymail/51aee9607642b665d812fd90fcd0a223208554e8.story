Dr Judith Ames appears before the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service accused of affair with husband of terminal cancer victim she was treating

A doctor started an affair with the husband of one of her patients just days after his wife died from cancer, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Dr Judith Ames, 55, was so besotted with the newly widowed man that she vowed to marry him just two weeks later.

Two days before Patient A’s death, on March 8, Dr Ames revealed to a receptionist that she had developed a bond with Mr X and was off to the couple’s home for ‘gin and tonics’.

She also confided in a community nurse that she was emotionally involved with Patient A and her family.

Within a month the GP had moved into his marital home and told colleagues she would quit her job if they disapproved of their relationship.

But friends and family of the dead woman were unhappy about the situation and Dr Ames was reported to the General Medical Council.

Speaking at a hearing of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, Simon Phillips, QC, for the GMC, said: ‘Patient A trusted Dr Ames to care for her and invited her into the family home.

‘Patient A was in a vulnerable position. Patient A’s family would have been in a vulnerable position. Dr Ames breached patient A’s trust. She knew or ought to have been aware that Mr X was likely to be vulnerable due to the recent death of his wife.’

The panel, which will decide whether the family doctor is fit to carry on working or should be struck off the medical register, was told that Dr Ames met Mr X while treating his wife for lung cancer.

The GP was working at the Mannamead Surgery, in Plymouth, when the woman went for a consultation in May 2011 complaining of dizziness.

She was referred to hospital, where medics diagnosed lung cancer.

Mr Phillips said that between May 2011 and March 2012, when Patient A died at the age of 59, Dr Ames made regular trips to the home she shared with her husband.

Dr Ames denies her actions were sexually motivated and an abuse of her professional position

Dr Ames visited her on the day of her death and returned to her home the following day.

Although the woman’s husband was also registered at the practice, Dr Ames never treated him, the barrister added.

Patient A died on March 8 and, on the day of the funeral, eight days later, Mr X texted Dr Ames, who was away on holiday.

She agreed to meet him for a bereavement visit the following weekend. They met up and decided they wanted to be together.

‘On her return from holiday 
Ames … discussed personal interests with Mr X following Mr X saying he 
no longer needed professional assistance from her in respect of his 
bereavement,’ Mr Phillips added.

‘On the weekend of March 24 and 25, 
2012, she agreed to attend church with Mr X and both he and Dr Ames 
decided that they wanted to have a relationship.’ On the Monday morning 
Dr Ames contacted her surgery and asked to be transferred to another 
practice. She told her business partner, Dr Peter Lemen that she wanted 
to have a relationship with Mr X and she planned to marry him.

Days before the patient¿s death Dr Ames, a partner at the Mannamead Surgery in Plymouth, Devon, told her receptionist she was off to the couple¿s home for a 'G&T'

Mr Phillips added: ‘She told him that 
she would be willing to resign from the practice if they were not happy 
with the relationship. Dr Lemen said he was taken aback and arranged a 
meeting with the other partners to discuss the matter.’

The panel were told that Dr Ames even 
called the GMC to inform regulators of the relationship before 
colleagues wrote with concerns.

The same week Mr X spoke to one of his
late wife’s close friends by telephone and told her he was planning to 
marry again and that he had been in a relationship for the past 
fortnight.

It is alleged that Dr Ames' actions were 
sexually motivated, an abuse of her professional position and were not 
in accordance with the GMC's guidance 'Maintaining Boundaries' 

He told the friend that his new lover,
Dr Ames, was ‘upstairs in bed’. The QC added: ‘She (the friend) said 
that she was shocked.’

On April 1 Dr Ames spoke to another 
partner at the medical practice, Dr Christopher Lloyd, and told him she 
had formed an emotional relationship with the spouse of one of her 
patients during the course of caring for his wife.

The following day the partners held a 
meeting, at which Dr Ames said she accepted the relationship with Mr X 
was likely to be in breach of GMC rules.

She claimed their relationship had the
‘genuine approval’ of Patient A’s family and that neighbours of Mr X 
were ‘supportive’. However, the panel heard that they were not happy 
about the affair.Last night it was unclear whether Dr Ames and Mr X, who
moved in together on April 14, were still in a relationship. The GP was
wearing a wedding ring at the hearing.

Dr Ames, who is subject to seven 
conditions on her registration for the duration of proceedings, faces 
allegations that her actions were sexually motivated, an abuse of her 
professional position and contrary to the GMC’s guidelines.

She admits several allegations of 
misconduct but denies her fitness to practise was impaired. If found 
guilty she could be suspended or even struck off the medical register.

Dr Lloyd told the hearing about the 
call from Dr Ames. He told the panel: ‘I was unclear when the 
relationship started but my presumption was that it had started earlier.

‘Even if it had started after the death of the lady I was still very concerned about the formation of this relationship.’

The case continues.
