Lewis Hamilton and Rory McIlroy will once again do battle for top dog in men's sport - after both were shortlisted for the 'Laureus World Sportsman of the Year Award.'

Two of the biggest names in British sport went head-to-head for the 'BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award' last year  - which saw the Formula One world champion come out on top.

But it's not going to be a straight fight between the two of them - as Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, tennis world No1 Novak Djokovic, MotoGP champion Marc Marquez and pole valuter Renuad Lavillenie have all been shortlisted.

Hamilton, who won his second world title last year, said: 'Knowing how prestigious the Laureus Award is I feel very, very grateful and proud to be amongst the great athletes that have been nominated. 

'It's great when you have these awards, which recognise the excellence and the commitment from lots of different individuals. I'm proud to be amongst them. 

'It's quite a line-up. Rory's done an amazing job. Ronaldo, what a great player he is, Djokovic, I mean he's killed everything. I could only have ever dreamed really, at this period of time in my life, to be up amongst them.'

Cristiano Ronaldo has also been shortlisted after his fine 2014 season which saw him win the Ballon d'Or

Marc Marquez of MotoGP and world tennis No1 Novak Djokovic have also been nominated for the award

The prestgious Laureus trophy was won by Hamilton's rival Sebastian Vettel last year and sporting legends such as Usain Bolt, Roger Federer, Tiger Woods and Michael Schumacher have also been awarded the prize.

Not only are McIlroy, Hamilton and Ronaldo competing for the top prize but they'll also have some interest in the 'Laureus World Team of the Year Award'.

Mercedes AMG Petronas, the European Ryder Cup squad and Real Madrid have all been nominated for the award but face strong competition from the Germany World Cup team.

Great Britain's Jo Pavey will be one of the names flying the flag for the women as she was shortlisted for the 'Laureus World Comeback of the Year Award.'

The long-distance runner won the European Championships 10,000 metres title - just ten months after giving birth and became the oldest woman to ever win the gold medal.

Oliver Wilson is another British name in with a chance after his impressive season - winning the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and climbing from 792 in the world to 156.

Like Pavey, Dame Sara Storey proved that giving birth isn't the end of a glittering sporting career and was nominated for the 'Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability Award.'

The London 2012 Paralympic Game double gold-medallist, won four world titles last year after taking time off to following the arrival of her daughter.  

Chinese tennis star Li Na will want nothing more then to win the 'Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year Award' in her home country after being named as one of the six candidates.

She's faced rival Serena Williams a number of times on the court but this time the two of them will soon be competing in other ways after the American was also shortlisted.

New Zealand's shot-putter Valerie Adams, Norway's skiing star Marit Bjørgen, Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba and Slovenia's Tina Maze have also made the cut.

World Cup heroes James Rodriguez and Mario Götze starred in Brazil and have rightly earned themselves a shot at winning the 'World Breakthrough of the Year Award.' 

Gotze scored the winning extra-time goal in the final for Germany and Colombia's Rodriguez was arguably the tournaments standout player - earning himself a lucrative move to Real Madrid.

They're joined by Grand Slam winner Mario Cilic, F1's Daniel Ricciardo, 18-year-old Olympic Slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin and the Switzerland Davis Cup team.

The awards ceremony is taking place in the luxurious city of Shanghai, China on April 15 to commemorate the achievements of the world's greatest sporting stars.
