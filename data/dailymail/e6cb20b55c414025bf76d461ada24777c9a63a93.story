Shamed former PR guru Max Clifford was allowed out of prison today to attend his older brother’s funeral.

Wearing a blue suit, tie and glasses, the convicted sex offender arrived at the North East Surrey Crematorium in Morden in a blacked-out white Renault van at around 2.15pm.

Clifford, 71, was brought out from the van 300ft from the cemetery chapel in handcuffs, flanked by security guards, before walking indoors for the service.

Clifford is currently serving an 
eight-year jail sentence after being found guilty at Southwark Crown 
Court in central London in May of a series of indecent 
assaults on victims as young as 15.

His brother, 
Bernard Clifford, died on Wednesday, August 6, and the funeral began at 
2.40pm. A group of security guards waited by the white van as other 
guests arrived for the service.

Clifford stood laughing and smiling with family and friends following the 30-minute service. The paedophile received hugs and kisses on the cheek from other guests.

Clifford's
 right hand was cuffed to a suit-wearing security guard as he spent 10 
minutes speaking with people outside the chapel. He shook hands with 
guests using his left hand and appeared relaxed.

Security guards in prison uniform patrolled around the crowd as Clifford stood speaking with people. Smiling and waving to the other guests, he was then led back to the waiting prison van.

Clifford then received a final hug by the vehicle from a woman. He stepped up into the back of the van, which was then driven off the site - but not before he gave photographers a thumbs-up.

Clifford
 - who is at Category C Littlehey jail in Cambridgeshire - was jailed for the
indecent assaults carried out between 1977 and 1984, using his 
celebrity connections to lure women.

A
 man who saw Clifford arrive at the service said: ‘I saw him come out of
 the side of the van wearing handcuffs. There were a few big guys with 
him. He went inside and is sat down in there now.’

The
 Ministry of Justice said it does not comment on individuals, but a 
spokesman said prisoners need to apply to attend a funeral and the 
prison assesses risk to the public.

It
 also looks at the prisoner's relationship to the dead person. If 
permission is granted, the prisoner is normally escorted to the funeral 
by staff.

In a statement 
handed out by his daughter Louise, Clifford wrote: ‘This is not the 
right time or the right place to discuss my situation.

‘I
 am here purely to pay my tribute to my brother Bernard, or Bunny, as I 
always called him. Bernard always was to me the serious and political 
one of the family.

‘He was a kind and caring man who had strong views and opinions and always stood up to be counted. To me he was just a wonderful and caring brother and friend.

‘I am here because I naturally wanted to be and most importantly because Iris and all of the family asked me to be here. My attendance here today was allowed by the Governor of Littlehey Mr Taylor, for which I am very grateful.’

Bernard Clifford 
was a former mayor of Merton and served on Merton Council as a Labour 
councillor for the Ravensbury ward in Mitcham and Morden.

He was said to have got his brother his first job in publishing as an editorial assistant at The Eagle.

In the 40 minute service, during which Bernard Clifford was cremated, his wife Iris, and other relatives remembered his life. Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence played as the coffin was lowered.

Passing
 sentence at London’s Southwark Crown Court, Judge Anthony 
Leonard told Max Clifford his personality and position in the public eye 
were the reasons his crimes were not revealed earlier.

The
 judge said that due to the historic nature of the offences, Clifford 
was charged under an act from 1956, which set the maximum term for each 
charge at two years.

Under 
later legislation passed in 2003, the maximum term would have been 10 
years, and for the worst instances would have been charged as rape or 
assault by penetration, which attract a maximum life term.

The
 former celebrity agent, who branded his accusers ‘fantasists’, remained
 defiant ahead of his sentencing, saying: ‘I stand by everything I have 
said in the last 17 months.’

Clifford has lodged an appeal against his sentence.

Max
 Clifford, who was born to an electrician and former maid in 1943, 
carved out a hugely successful career for himself prior to his arrest.

Raised
 in south London, he left school at 15-years-old with no qualifications 
and quickly landed himself a job as a reporter on his local paper.

It led to his first job in PR, which would help him become the country’s most infamous publicist over time.

Disgraced PR Guru Max Clifford (pictured in 1992) was particularly well-known for his involvement in celebrity 'kiss-and-tell' stories for tabloid newspapers and represented a number of high-profile clients over the years

He
 spent years building up his contacts book and soon his PR empire 
represented a host of high-profile figures from Simon Cowell and Jade 
Goody to Gary Glitter and Freddie Star.

He
 was particularly well-known for his involvement in ‘kiss-and-tell’ 
stories for tabloid newspapers and represented a number of clients 
including Rebecca Loos – who alleged to have an affair with David 
Beckham.

With a £3million 
mansion in Surrey’s stockbroker belt, homes in the Cotswolds and 
Marbella and with a Rolls-Royce complete with a personal number plate 
(100 Max), Clifford made the most of his £1million-a-year salary.

However,
 his career and reputation took a sudden downfall in December 2012 when 
he was arrested by detectives from Operation Yewtree. He was charged the
 following April with a string of indecent assaults.

Clifford (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court earlier this year) was jailed for eight years for a string of indecent assaults between 1977 and 1984

The
 investigation, Scotland Yard's inquiry into historic allegations of 
sexual offences, was prompted after claims were made against the late DJ
 Jimmy Savile.

After his arrest in 2012, Clifford was invited on to ITV’s Daybreak, where he claimed he was the victim of a ‘witch hunt’.

Throughout the subsequent trial, he showed no ounce of remorse and regularly displayed a nonchalant and arrogant approach.

He
 was jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court in May after a jury
 found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage 
girls and young women between 1977 and 1984.

The
 judge said that if the offences had taken place today – since 
sentencing guidelines were toughened in 2003 – Clifford would have been 
regarded as a multiple rapist for which he would have been locked up for
 life. 

The maximum sentence for indecent assault at the time was two years.

The
 71-year-old committed the offences after luring and 'degrading' women 
through his celebrity connections during his high-profile career.

Sentencing
 Clifford, Judge Leonard said: 'The reason why they were not brought to 
light sooner was because of your own dominant character and your 
position in the world of entertainment which meant that your victims 
thought that you were untouchable, something that I think you too 
believed.'

For Clifford’s 
eight offences, the judge gave him a series of sentences of 12 months, 
18 months, 24 months, six months, 21 months and 15 months, some to run 
concurrently and some consecutively, to arrive at a total of eight 
years.

He is now serving his 
sentence at Category C Littlehey jail in Cambridgeshire and has lodged 
an appeal to the Court of Appeal against his sentence.
