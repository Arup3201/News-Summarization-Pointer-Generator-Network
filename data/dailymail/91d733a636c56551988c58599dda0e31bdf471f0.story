This is the battered face of an 81-year-old great grandfather and war veteran who dared to challenge a gang of young thugs.

Having survived three years as a prisoner of war in Korea, Barney Alcock wasn’t scared to confront the youngsters he found throwing fruit at his window.

The result was a beating which left him with savage cuts and bruises to his face, and so traumatised that he has had little to eat or drink for a week.

'Shouting': Veteran Barney Alcock, 81, had left his house in Grimsby to plead with the group of young boys to stop throwing fruit at his windows

His wife Thelma, 76, who was on the 
phone to police reporting the youngsters when he was attacked, found him
 lying face down on the ground with his glasses broken and vest drenched
 in blood.

Police later arrested a 14-year-old boy over the attack.

The teenager was allegedly among a 
group of youths who had spent the evening hanging around the street in 
Grimsby, Lincolnshire, shouting abuse and throwing berries at the 
elderly couple’s window.

Mrs Alcock said she had gone outside to tell them off and Mr Alcock, a former army corporal, was woken up and did the same.

Mrs Alcock said: ‘There is no such thing as respect for elders nowadays. I was horrified to find what they had done to Barney.’

She said Mr Alcock, who suffers from 
dementia, had quickly forgotten what had happened to him and repeatedly 
asked her why he was covered in blood.

‘He is in so much agony and  keeps 
touching his head asking why it hurts. He has hardly eaten or drunk 
anything since this happened. It’s really affected him deep inside.

‘He’s afraid to go out and for people to see his injuries in the street.’

Distress: Mr Alcock, 81, has struggled to eat or drink in the wake of the attack in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, his wife said

Attack: The youths turned on Mr Alcock when he tried to reason with them in Winchester Avenue, near his home in Grimsby

Mrs Alcock said when she  realised 
they were hurling berries at the window she stood at the front door 
telling them to stop. When I threatened to call the police, they swore 
and said “call the police and see if we care”.

Barney was in bed and was woken by their constant swearing and shouting.’

Mr Alcock stood at his gate for ten 
minutes talking to the youths, who walked off. But soon after they 
returned and Mr Alcock went outside again and was assaulted.

‘He crossed the road to ask them to 
leave as I watched from the front window and called the police,’ said 
Mrs Alcock. ‘I turned back from the phone to see Barney lying on the 
ground covered in blood and the boys running away.’

She added: ‘I was absolutely  
petrified, shaking and didn’t  know what to do. We’ve never had any sort
 of trouble on this estate and we’ve lived here over 50 years.’

After surviving being a prisoner of 
war in the 1950s, Mr Alcock worked as a builder and lorry driver and has
 six children, 15 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.

He said yesterday: ‘I’ve suffered 
worse injuries than this in the Korean war. I’ve had a lot of people 
ringing me up to see how I am.’

Mrs Alcock said: ‘He is a 
happy-go-lucky bloke. He has a good sense of humour and loves being with
 kids. It’s just awful to think that a gang of kids would do something 
like this. How would they feel if it was their grandad?’

A Humberside Police spokesman said the 14-year-old boy arrested has been released on police bail.

Detective Chief Inspector Craig 
Scaife said: ‘Our efforts will be concentrated on establishing the 
circumstances leading to this attack.’
