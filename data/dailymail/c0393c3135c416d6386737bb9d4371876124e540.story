After what seems to be a rather uncomfortable weekend for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian president has applauded the Australian government's handling of the event in Brisbane.

In an address to supporters in Moscow, Mr Putin had kind words to say about not only the atmosphere of the conference but also about Tony Abbott, despite the prime minister threatening he would 'shirtfront' the Russian leader over the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 before it started.

'(Our) Australian partners created an extraordinarily welcoming atmosphere for work. I was surprised by the warmth with which normal Australian citizens received our delegation,' Mr Putin said, according to an official transcript.

Mr Putin's seemed to fly in the face of media reports that the Russian president was so frustrated at being sidelined and subjected to tough talk by Western leaders that he left the summit early.

Mr Putin's visit to Australia was marred by a series of diplomatic snubs and frostiness from Western leaders, sparking an early exit for the Russian strongman who flew out of Australia on Sunday afternoon, cutting his intended stay short.

While Mr Putin's delegation claimed his swift exodus was as a result of the long flight back to Russia and his need to be well-rested for his return to official business on Monday morning, some have speculated whether a 'tense' meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron was the straw that broke the President's back.

Another contributor to the strain between Mr Putin and other nations came when Mr Abbott, President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe used the G20 to criticise Russian's efforts to destabilise eastern Ukraine.

But despite all this Mr Putin thanked the host country and its prime minister - who he described as a 'very businesslike person' - before his departure on Sunday and praised the 'constructive atmosphere' of the summit, news.com.au reported.

Mr Abbott also backed down on the strong stance he had taken against his Russian counterpart before the G20 summit, putting differences aside and acknowledging President Putin was a guest in Australia.

'President Putin is a member of the G20 and I was happy to treat him with respect and courtesy while he was here in Australia,' Mr Abbott said.
