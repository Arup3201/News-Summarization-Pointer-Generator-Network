They were the bread and butter cars of British family motoring during the 1970s and ‘80s and still remembered nostalgically by millions– yet today they are an endangered species.

But a generation of popular cars that once dominated the nation’s highways and kerbsides – with evocative names like Allegro, Montego, Maestro, Marina and  Maxi - are now on the brink of extinction.

Some were called Princesses. Others like the Austin Metro - successor to the Mini and named by its workforce - were driven by one.

The Hillman Imp is fading into obscurity, with just 906 in existence today, the report found

Despite its sleek-looking front, the Rover SD1 has just 310 lucky owners now

Morris Ital 1.3 HL. Introduced in 1980, the Morris Ital was available with the 1275cc A-plus engine or the 1700cc O-series engine

Yet, for example, only 174 Morris Itals are left of the 175,247 that were built. And some models fare even worse.

For unlike their sportier siblings of the same era all but a few die-hard fans are maintaining them fit  for the road.

The fascinating details of a dying breed that will rekindle memories for millions of mums and dads who remember them from their own childhoods are revealed today in a new analysis by car industry expert Honest John and his website classics.honestjohn.co.uk

The analysis of cars built before 1995 reveals that  when measured and ranked as as a proportion of the total of each model built, 1980s cars have disappeared from roads faster than any others.

But while some may mourn  that so few are left, others with less rose-tinted spectacles and memories  of  the era of poor car quality and motor industry strikes epitomised by union militants like Derek ‘Red Robbo’ Robinson, may wonder instead that any of them have survived at all.

The Austin Ambassador's classic design was a eye-catching in its day, and it now turns heads because it's such a rare sight

Sight for sore eyes: The MG 1300 is one of the most endangered cars on British roads today

Dying breed: Austin Metro was the successor to the Mini and named by its workforce

The Austin Allegro is highest on the list of endangered cars with just 0.0453 per cent of those even built still being driven today. Famed for its square or ‘quartic’ steering wheel, of the 642,340 Allegros built between 1973 and 1982, just 291 remain today.

Though by its fans and owners’ group, the report says it marks the point at which ‘British Leyland lost the will to live.’

The Allegro is followed by such evocative names as the Austin Montego (just 296 remain), the wedge-shaped  Austin Princess (121),  Hillman Avenger (369) , and the classic Vauxhall Viva (1,057), Morris Marina (674), Austin Maxi (401), Morris Ital (174), the ground-breaking and futuristic looking Rover SD1 (310), and the  Vauxhall VX series including  the Victor and Ventora. Fewer than 1,000 (995) are still around.

Next in the  endangered list comes the popular Austin Metro which enjoyed celebrity status as Princess Diana's car when she married Charles in July 1981  - just 1,930  of the 1.5 million built  between 1980 and 1981 survive today.

The wedge-shaped Austin Princess has just 121 left in existence after owners switched to more modern models

The report warned that 1980s cars are particularly vulnerable because their passage into popular classic status is yet to happen and their disappearance has been hastened by needless scrappage

There are a mere 401 Austin Maxi's left on Britain's roads today - and signal the end of the era of 1980s cars

Then there’s the legendary  Ford Cortina which most recently had its moment of fame as a star of retro Sweeney-style police drama ‘Life on Mars’ set in the 1970s and which has fared slightly better with 5,411 still around – but still only 1.13 per cent of the  4.15million built  tin the 20 years to 1982.

 Next is the MG 100 and 1300 (206 survive), the Austin Maestro (1,012), the polular Vauxhall Chevette (768), Austin Ambassador (just 84), the cute Hillman Imp with an engine that used to blow (906),  Rover 200 (1,371), and the Triumph Acclaim (488).

Propping up 20th place is the infamous ‘jelly-mould’ Ford Sierra of 1982-93 of  which some 15,282 remain out of a total run of 3.47million  or 0.44 per cent.

The HonestJohn.co.uk report notes: ‘The 1980s may have enjoyed a fashion and pop revival but cars from that decade are some of the most endangered cars on British roads today.

Many of UK's once-popular family cars are on the verge of disappearing completely.’

It notes: ‘The Austin Metro is typical. It was once a common sight on British roads and enjoyed celebrity status as Princess Diana's car when she married Charles in July 1981.

The Morris Marina is under-appreciated, with only 674 left in the care of owner today. Many of UK's once-popular family cars are on the verge of disappearing completely

A 1983 Vauxhall Chevette may have been popular at the time, but the amount on the roads has dwindled to 768

Nippy run around: The Austin has fared a little better, with 1,012 in existence

The legendary Ford Cortina most recently had its moment of fame as a star of retro Sweeney-style police drama 'Life on Mars' set

‘It was also the driving school car of 
choice for BSM, and everyone knew someone who had one – and now, there's
a mere 823 Austin Metros, from an original production run of 1.5 
million between 1981-1991.’

The report adds: ‘The once-derided Austin Allegro has suffered the largest decline of all, with just 291 remaining in the UK at the end of 2011, from a total production run of 640,000 between 1973 and 1982.

‘The Ford Cortina is another model on the list that may raise a few eyebrows. After all it was Britain's best-selling car between 1973 and 1980.

‘Once upon a time, it was the darling of a million sales reps – but it most recently had its moment of fame as the star of  the TV drama Life on Mars. Just 5,411 remain registered in the UK, from more than four million built.’

But while all top 20 cars on the ‘Most Endangered List’ have a survival rate of less than 1 per cent,  some classic cars at the other end of the scale had impressive survival rates.

The Lotus Elan emerges as the UK’s most popular classic car with 38 per cent of its pre-1995 models (3,361) still surviving today.

It is followed by the Triumph Stag with a quarter (25%) of those built between 1970 and 1977 (6,466) still around.

The sporty Reliant Scimitar is in third place with more than  one in 5 (21.2 per cent) of ther total satill around (3,240)

Keith Adams, editor of Honest John Classics said: 'This list of endangered cars is fascinating – pretty much all of them littered the UK roads as recently as 10 years ago and now you’ll be lucky to spot them at a classic car meeting.

‘The low survival rate for these models is shocking. 1980s cars are particularly vulnerable – because their passage into popular classic status is yet to happen and their disappearance has been hastened by needless scrappage and artificially low market values in recent years.'

Mr Adams added: ‘If you're a fan of unloved 1990s family cars, the read 'em and weep - for they are going fast. If you want one, be quick before they're all gone!’

The ‘Top 20 Endangered Cars’ research by Honestjohn.co.uk was created by examining DVLA records of classic cars registered between 1950 and 1995 to find out how many were still registered today – both legally on the road or having been  registered as being off the  road compared to the amount originally built.

The results are published at the newly launched website classics.honestjohn.co.uk
