It was a ticket free-for-all reminiscent of the great Olympic lottery of last year.

Just two hours after it was announced that Noma, officially the World's Best Restaurant, was coming to London, all 3,000 of the £200 tickets had sold out.

A staggering 10,000 people pre-registered in the hope of booking a seat for 'A taste of Noma at Claridge’s' - and thousands of those were left disappointed.

Success story: Noma head chef Rene Redzepi is bringing his world-renowned restaurant to Claridge's during the Games this summer

The 10-day event welcomes renowned chef,
Rene Redzepi, and his award-winning restaurant, Noma, which is based in
Copenhagen, to London.

The dining experience, which attracted overwhelming demand, will be hosted during the Olympics by Claridge’s hotel in central London.

The meal of a lifetime will come at a cost, with the five-course menu priced at £195. But those successful in the lottery will no doubt be awaiting the event with eager anticipation, given Noma's astounding global success.

Redzepi’s Danish establishment has held the title of the 'World’s Best Restaurant' for the past three years.

The award is run by British magazine 
Restaurant based on a poll of international chefs, restaurateurs, 
gourmands and restaurant critics.

Impressive environs: Noma will be a pop-up in Claridge's hotel, where the famous ballroom will seat 3,000 diners over 10 days

The legendary chef, who was this 
month included in Time magazine’s list of ‘The 100 Most Influential 
People in the World’, has never before taken Noma overseas.

But given the interest he has attracted, it is likely this won't be the last time.

Diner David Sims, of Southampton, Hants, who managed to get a table for four, said: 'This will be the culinary event of the year in the UK.

'It is like the Rolling Stones of cooking coming to your home town.'

There were 3,400 tickets available for the event - 170 will be seated in the hotel’s ornate ballroom for lunch and dinner over the 10 days.

Thomas Koch, general manager at Claridge’s, said: 'We knew 10,000 people had registered, but we never expected all of them to try to book.

Top notch: Noma, in Copenhagen, has been voted World's Best Restaurant three years running by industry experts

Innovative: Redzepi, 34, has sparked a cultural revolution with his focus on foraging and his reinterpretation of Nordic cuisine, but for his London pop-up he will focus on British ingredients

'Bringing Rene and his approach to food to London was essential in creating this dining experience.

'It’s not intended to replicate a visit to Noma in Copenhagen, it will be Rene’s food with British ingredients. 'The lucky people who have succeeded in their bookings will be very, veryhappy.'

Redzepi, 34, has sparked a cultural revolution with his focus on foraging and his reinterpretation of Nordic cuisine.

The pop-up restaurant will be open from 28 July 28 to 6 August  - coinciding with the period the London 2012 Olympics are being staged.

Mr Koch added: 'It’s a very special time for London.

'Our city will have the world’s eyes on it and we wanted to contribute to the experience - which is how the idea came about.'

The Copenhagen restaurant is being renovated during the two weeks that Noma is in London.
