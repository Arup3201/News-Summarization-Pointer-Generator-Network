A schoolboy who was banned from becoming a Boy Scout has won a landmark legal ruling against the group.

Clare and Barry Coyne were left devastated when their autistic son Thomas,11, was refused admission to the Scouts after four years in the younger Beaver and Cubs group.

Now after a legal battle against leaders of the 36th Sheffield Scouts Thomas has won £5,000 in compensation - and his parents hope to raise awareness to stop other youngsters suffering the same problem.

Clare Coyne (pictured) says she was ‘shocked and hurt’ to be told Thomas would not be allowed to move into Scouts when she tried to register him for a camping trip in July last year

Mrs Coyne says she was ‘shocked and hurt’ to be told Thomas would not be allowed to move into Scouts when she tried to register him for a camping trip in July last year.

Mr and Mrs Coyne, who volunteered for Cub committees and accompanied their son to sessions, were told their child posed a ‘significant health and safety risk to other Scouts and himself’.

She said: 'I couldn’t believe the Scout leader at the time was refusing Thomas a place, based on an assumption because of his disability.

'It was only when I was registering Thomas to attend the trip that the leader delivered the news.

'He then emailed me back saying Thomas couldn’t progress to Scouts or attend the camping trip, because "he lacks independence".

'To be told, with no prior discussion, that he was not progressing to Scouts with his friends was devastating.

'I was also shocked and hurt to receive the news by email - especially after acting as parent rep for the group.'

A Scout Association spokesman vowed that the organisation would 'take on board any lessons learned in this case'

The Scout leader and a district commissioner then asked Mrs Coyne, 44, from Fulwood, Sheffield, for an apology when she made an official complaint of disability discrimination.

She added: 'Thomas enjoyed four happy years at Ranmoor Beavers and Cubs. He didn’t cause any problems whatsoever.

'My child is gorgeous, not violent or aggressive. His former leaders had discussed Thomas’ needs with us, but the Scout leader didn’t - and wouldn’t back down on his decision.

'When he started at Beavers he could say about seven words and now he’s this articulate, funny, happy boy. It helped him so much.

'He is in special needs education and even though it is amazing, this allowed him to make friends near his home and do something in his own community.

'The whole family were very much involved with both groups, my 13-year-old daughter is a member of the same Scouts. I couldn’t believe they chose to tell me via email. They didn’t try and explain why, or have a discussion with us. It was horrific after four very happy years.

'We faced huge legal costs if we lost, but I felt a duty to fight this for other children out there.'

Mrs Coyne sought legal advice from Sheffield Citizens’ Advice and Law Centre. 

The action was later settled before the case went to county court and the Scout Association paid £5,000 in compensation, which will be held by the court until Thomas is aged 18.

Thomas has since taken up a place at the 79th St Timothy’s Scout Group in Sheffield, but Mrs Coyne says Thomas has already missed out despite moving to another group.

She said: 'The financial compensation can’t replace the friendships and experiences Thomas has missed.

'We want to be lessons to be learned to avoid another family going through the distress that we have experienced.'

Scout Association spokesman Simon Carter said: 'We do intend to take on board any lessons learned in this case.

'Our volunteer team is passionate about making sure we offer scouting to as many young people as possible whatever their needs.'
