Even the most hard-nosed of criminals didn't dare venture outside this record-breaking winter.

According to official figures, Chicago recorded half as many murders in January 2014 as compared to the same month in 2013, with the weather most likely the cause.

There were 11 days of subzero temperatures this January, making it one of the coldest months in recent history.

Police have reported 20 killings in that time, according to The Chicago Sun-Times.

Comparatively, in January 2013, 40 people were murdered.

In January 2012, 38 people were killed and in January 2011, there 28 slayings.

Big freeze: Chicago's record-low January temperatures are believed to be the cause of a 50 per cent drop in murders this year as compared with the same time last year. There were 20 killings in 2014 and 40 in 2013

'The superintendent has said weather is a factor, but its not the only factor,' Chicago Police spokesman Adam Collins told The Sun-Times.

'It neither causes nor prevents crime.'

Nineteen of the 20 people killed were males, and the most common victim was a 19-year-old man.

The youngest victim was 15-year-old Miguel Naverrette and the oldest was 44-year-old Edward Caridine.

Eighteen of the 20 murders were shootings.

In the other two, Stephanie Serrano was stabbed to death at a Jan. 6 party and Caridine was found beaten to death in his apartment Jan. 22, according autopsies performed by the medical examiner’s office.

Three of the city’s 77 community areas had multiple murders in January.

The Chicago Lawn community had the most killings with five.

South Lawndale and Chatham also tallied multiple slayings with three and two, respectively.

Record-lows: Official weather figures show the extent of this year's wintry January. The average temperature was 15.5 degrees, while there were 11 days of subzero temperatures

The decrease in murders came in one of the coldest January's in recent years.

The average temperature in January 2014 was about 15.5 degrees — about 8.5 degrees colder than normal, according to the National Weather Service.

The average temperature was about 26.5 degrees in January 2013 and about 30 degrees in January 2012 — nearly three to 6.5 degrees warmer than normal.

Despite the colder temperature, Chicago still tallied a murder on 14 different days in January 2014 — including one on the coldest day of the month when the average temperature was minus-9 degrees.

The city recorded 90 shootings and 98 shooting victims in January 2014 — the lowest total in the past four years, police said.

In the first month of 2013, the city had 158 shootings and 186 victims.
