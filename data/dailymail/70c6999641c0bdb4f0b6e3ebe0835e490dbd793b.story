Ayman Ibrahim was accused of attempting to frame his ex-wife's new lover for the bombing of an IKEA store

A jealous ferry worker tried to frame his ex-wife's new partner by claiming he was plotting to blow up IKEA, a court has heard.

Ayman Ibrahim, who works for P&O ferries, phoned up the IKEA national call centre.

He said he ran a cafe in Bristol and had overheard Russians hatching a bomb plot for the days following New Year's Eve, 2011.

Police swooped on the Bristol store and two addresses in the city, but no bomb or bomb-making factory was discovered, Gloucester Crown Court heard yesterday.

The court was told Ibrahim made the hoax call in an attempt to deport ex-wife Maria Wierzbicka 's new partner, Bartosz Ociepka.

Ibrahim, 46, who now lives in Dover, denies communicating false information with intent on December 30, 2011.

Karen Chamberlain, an IKEA team leader, told the jury a call was put through to her from a middle-aged sounding man with a calm but heavy Eastern European accent.

She told the court: 'He said that he knew that there was a bomb to be put into a Bristol store.

'He said he had a coffee shop and he overheard people speaking in Russian. He said he couldn't understand it but his wife did.

'They were plotting to put a bomb in the IKEA store in the next couple of days in Bristol.

'I asked him if he knew where or how it would be set off but he said "no". He said he felt he had to warn us.'

Mrs Chamberlain told how the caller referred to IKEA stores being bombed in Belgium and Germany by a large group.

She told the jury: 'He gave a person's name and he gave their address and postcode. He didn't give me his own name, he said he had a wife and family and it was for his safety.

'At one point he did say "Mark".'

The court heard how the caller spelled out the name of the 'bomber' and said he had a lot of contacts as he was a pizza delivery driver.

Holly Webb, defending, suggested to Mrs Chamberlain that when she took the call she misheard 'storm' and noted down 'bomb', which the witness denied.

Ms Wierzbicka told how they split in 2008 but Ibrahim had court arranged contact with their daughter.

Ms Wierzbicka said she formed a new relationship with Mr Ociepka, but they broke up in the summer of 2011.

She told the jury: 'He (Ibrahim) was very negative towards Mr Ociepka. He said he would get him deported.'

Mr Ociepka, speaking via a Polish interpreter, said he was baffled when police arrested him in connection with a bomb plot.

He said: 'I concluded it was a mistake and maybe I was not the right person. The police were looking for a Polish man and in the street where I live there are plenty of Polish guys.

Ibrahim referred to IKEA stores being bombed in other European countries.

In 2011 there were attacks in Belgium, France, the Czech republic, Netherlands and Germany.

The bombings were timed over five months.

While no one was killed in the attacks, two people were injured in Germany.

Booby-trapped alarm clocks blew up at IKEA stores in Belgium, France and the Netherlands on 30 May.

A blast in the kitchen equipment department of a store in Dresden, Germany, left two customers needing hospital treatment on 10 June.

Police evacuated two stores in the Czech Republic, defusing a booby-trapped device found near one of them on 2 September.

Suspects were thought to have been attempting to extort 6million euros from the chain of homeware stores.

Polish Police arrested and charged two suspects later that year.

'I thought the police had knocked on the wrong door.'

When police asked him who might have implicated him in a bomb plot, he originally didn't have a clue.

He said: 'I just thought he (Ibrahim) was the only person who might have some grudge against me.'

Ms Webb, defending, suggested that on December 16, 2011, Mr Ociepka was in a Tesco superstore cafe in Bristol with some Russian men.

He said he had not been there, and he only spoke three or four words of Russian having nothing more to do with the language after primary school.

Though police searched IKEA for a bomb or bomb making equipment, they found nothing, the court heard.

Police searches of Mr Ociepka's home in Hayward Road, Barton Hill, and Ms Wierzbicka's home in Whitwell Road, Bristol, also drew a blank.

Analysis of Ibrahim's mobile phone showed he came to Bristol leading up to the threat, but his female friend's phone showed she remained in Kent.

Ibrahim told the jury he travelled from Dover to Bristol to buy a car and arranged, through Miss Wierzbicka, to take his daughter to school.

He said that, in Bristol, he met a Latvian couple hitchhiking and agreed to take them to a cafe at Tesco before giving them a lift back to Dover.

It was at the Tesco cafe, he said, that he spotted the couple sat near two men chatting with Mr Ociepka.

Ibrahim said the Latvian couple told him about the cafe conversation as he drove them to Dover later.

He told the jury: 'They said the two guys sitting with Mr Ociepka were absolutely mad.

'They were talking about storming IKEA.

'The girl said there was nothing funny about it, it had happened in Europe.

'I took no notice. I got back to Dover and I tried to get some information to decide whether to report it or just let it go.'

Ibrahim clutched a batch of photocopies in the witness box, containing news reports of bombings at IKEAs in Europe.

He said he took advice from a friend before reporting what he had been told was planned for IKEA in Bristol, some to weeks later.

He said: 'They were storming the place. It was my duty to report it. It is a duty of any citizen. It is not a crime.

'They were going to storm IKEA in Bristol during the January sales.'

Ibrahim said he posed as a Bristol cafe owner to make his tip-off seem more credible, and he didn't give his name to protect his family.

The P&O Ferries security man said he used his own mobile phone because he had nothing to hide.

He admitted identifying Mr Ociepka to police, and showed the jury a picture of a suspect related to an attack on IKEA which he thought resembled Mr Ociepka.

The case continues.
