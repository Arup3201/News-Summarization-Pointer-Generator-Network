Government cuts after the next election will be even deeper than previously announced – but will come to an end earlier than planned, Treasury figures revealed today.

George Osborne said he needed to slash a further £30billion from government spending by 2017/18, with £12billion of savings coming from the welfare budget.

The Government's spending watchdog said the planned cuts would be deeper than 'anything seen over the past five years'.

But once the books have been balanced the Government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade in 2019/20.

Government spending as a percentage of GDP will no longer fall to the lowest level since the 1930s, after Mr Osborne dropped plans to run a £23billion surplus in 2019/20

The Office for Budget Responsibility said the plans amounted to a 'rollercoaster' of public spending.

Mr Osborne's proposal to end austerity a year earlier than expected appeared to be designed to blunt Labour's claim that state spending will shrink to a level not seen since the 1930s.

But delivering his Budget today, the Chancellor said new plans would mean state spending as a share of national income the same size as Britain had in 2000 - when Labour was in office - but before, Mr Osborne said, 'spending got out of control'.

The Chancellor used his speech to trumpet official forecasts showing better economic growth. Borrowing will also be £5billion less than expected over the next three years, he said.

Mr Osborne said official predictions also saw the national debt starting to fall earlier than had previously been thought.

National debt as a proportion of GDP will start to fall next year, not 2016/17 as previously thought.

Under George Osborne's plans, Government spending will fall as a proportion of GDP to a level last seen in 2000 under Tony Blair

The Government is still spending £90 billion more than it raises in taxes – and this will only be wiped out by 2018/19.

For 2015/16, the deficit will be cut to £75.3billion in 2015/16 and then £39.4billion the following year. In 2017/18 it will fall to £12.8billion before moving into a surplus of £5.2billion the year after.

But in 2019/20, the planned surplus will only rise to £7billion instead of the previously planned £23.1billion.

Meanwhile, debt as a proportion of GDP is expected to fall in the next fiscal year to 80.2 per cent.

He said: 'This is a Budget that takes Britain one more big step on the road from austerity to prosperity.

'Because the national debt share is falling a year earlier than forecast at the Autumn Statement, the squeeze on public spending ends a year earlier too.

'In the final year of this decade, 2019-20, public spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy. We can do that while still running a healthy surplus to bear down on our debt.'
