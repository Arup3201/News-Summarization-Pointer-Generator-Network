Miranda Kerr's mother has revealed her recent three-night hospital stay was because of heart problems she was experiencing.

Therese Kerr took to her Instagram account on Friday night to thank her fans for their 'well-wishes' following her visit to the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney.

The 48-year-old had been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat and said she was admitted for routine tests 'after a couple of recent incidences'.

Outpatient: Miranda Kerr's mother Therese has revealed her hospital stay was down to heart problems

Get well soon! Therese took to her Instagram to thanks her 12,200 followers for their 'well-wishes' alongside a picture of a beautiful bunch of pink flowers

'Hey gorgeous people, thank you everyone for your well wishes during my recent stay in hospital,' she wrote to her 12,200 followers alongside a picture of a beautiful bunch of pink blooms.

'I have a genetic heart arrhythmia, which I have had to have routine tests for after a couple of recent incidences, but all is great now as I am home with my beautiful family.'

The mother-of-two is sure to be glad to be able to spend some time with Miranda and her adorable three-year-old son Flynn before they jet back to New York.

Care package: The model's father John, along with her grandmother Ann and son Flynn, as well as other relatives, went to see Therese at the Royal North Shore hospital on Thursday, where she had been admitted for tests

Family visit: Miranda did not accompany her family on Thursday due to business commitments

The Kerr family visited Therese in hospital on Thursday, including Miranda's father John, her grandmother Ann and son Flynn - who looks the image of his father, Orlando Bloom.

The model didn't join the family as she was having meetings with representatives from her Kora Organics range.

Therese was also notably absent on Friday morning as Miranda revealed the $299 tea set she designed in collaboration with Royal Albert china.

The 31-year-old had the support of her grandmother Ann at the event who she said inspired her to create the china.

Keeping it in the family: Miranda launched her Royal Albert tea set at a pop store for the brand in Sydney on Friday - and made sure her special guest was her grandmother Ann

Brew break: Miranda posted this cute picture of her enjoying a cuppa with her grandma at the event with the caption: 'Tea for two with my Nan'

To go with her international model image, the model wore not one, but two Victoria Beckham dresses.

The first - a white knee length dress with blocks of plum, pink and maroon in a graphic design across the bust.

And for a consumer event held soon after, she changed into a fitted magenta dress with a cropped sheath on the top.

She finished off both looks with a pair of nude pointed heels by Celine and catseye sunglasses by Miu Miu.
