A major incident was reportedly declared at a hospital in Essex over concerns raised by the health regulator following a surprise inspection.

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) apparently inspected Colchester Hospital's accident and emergency department and emergency assessment unit on Wednesday and told the trust of 'safeguarding concerns'.

Following the unannounced visit the watchdog found patients being inappropriately restrained, sedated without consent and do not resuscitate signs being ignored, the Guardian reported.

A major incident has reportedly been declared at Colchester Hospital over 'safeguarding concerns' raised by the Care Quality Commission

Professor Mike Richards, the CQC's chief inspector, told the newspaper that they had carried out the unannounced inspection following 'concerns.'

'Following the inspection, we gave feedback to the trust about our safeguarding concerns so that it could take appropriate action to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its patients,' he told the Guardian.

A spokesman for the hospital trust said it could not responded to the specific allegations made by the Guardian because they had not seen the CQC's full report

In July the CQC gave the hospital an overall rating of 'requires improvement'.

Peter Wilson, acting chairman of Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust told the Guardian it was facing 'unprecedented demand' on its services.

Professor Mike Richards, the CQC's chief executive, said they carried out the surprise inspection in response to concerns

The trust's interim chief executive, Dr Lucy Moore, said it was 'a difficult time for the trust'.

 She said: 'The Care Quality Commission raised a small number of safeguarding concerns when its team gave immediate feedback at the end of the inspection on Wednesday.

'The Trust takes safeguarding extremely seriously and is now investigating to find out whether our policies had been followed appropriately.'

In the wake of the announcement more staff were said to have been drafted into the hospital, non urgent surgery rescheduled and where safe to do so patients discharged.  

Mr Wilson said they were disappointed that the CQC felt the situation at the hospital had not improved, and confirmed it had declared a major incident to review various aspects of service at the hospital.

The trust said the major incident is likely to last a week, and appealed to members of the public only to visit the accident and emergency department if they have a 'serious or life-threatening condition'. 

The CQC said it will publish its latest report on the hospital 'in due course', and added that it will carry out further inspections at the trust. 

The major incident was declared at the hospital the day after Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, announced that the NHS was to receive an additional £300 million to help them cope this winter.
