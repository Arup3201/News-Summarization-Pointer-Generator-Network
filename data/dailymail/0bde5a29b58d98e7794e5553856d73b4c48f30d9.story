Beleaguered Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari has refused to quit following his side's crushing 7-1 defeat to Germany.

Brazil were favourites to win their 
sixth World Cup with the tournament on home soil but fell 
at the penultimate hurdle to a ruthless Germany side.

'We have a deal with the CBF until the game on 
Saturday and after that, probably, we will have a conversation to sort 
some things out,' he said, in a press conference on Wednesday.

Proven record: Scolari holds up a piece of paper detailing his record since taking over in November 2012

The 65-year-old held up a sheet of paper detailing Brazil's record since he took over at the end of 2012.

In
 28 matches the Selecao have won 19, drawn six and lost three. In 11 
competitive fixtures they have lost just once - the defeat to Germany 
on Tuesday - winning eight times and drawing the other two games.

Last summer Brazil comfortably won the Confederations Cup on home soil under Scolari, beating Spain 3-0 in the final.

Despite their dismal display against Germany, Scolari tried to take positives from the World Cup campaign.

'The tournament was not all bad,' he added. 
'We had a bad defeat. With all the difficulties we reached the semi-finals. We are a hard-working team, we win together and lose together.

'The crash was also the coaching 
staff, the fans, it was overall, no one understood, and the team from 
Germany, which is good, took the opportunity.

'I cannot explain, I will not justify. An error occurred and this error was fatal.

'If I could explain what happened in those six minutes, I would answer. But I do not know.'

'We can lose by one or two but we lost in a way that we had never done before in the history of Brazilian football.'

How the media reacted: Meia Hora's front page says 'Will Not Cover', seeking to ignore any mention of the embarrassment (and says how another goal was scored by Germany while they were editing it), while Lance list a few words of feeling; Pain, Indignation and Revolt and Shame amongst them

'After the World Cup we will submit a report to the board of the CBF where you will see the good and the bad that we did and then it depends on the direction,' he added. 'This is not going through my head right now.

'I will continue with my life, the players will also continue to be winners and we must continue - you can not end the life of the players for it.

'History will have to record that Brazil, for the first time since 2002, reached the semi-finals.'

Scolari went on to predict that the current crop of players would go on to achieve success in the future.

'There is a group which will achieve good things in two or three years. It's a long-term job but it is already being done.'

His assistant Carlos Alberto Parreira 
said this was now a time to re-examine Brazilian football after 
admitting Germany were far more advanced in all aspects of the game.

'They
 have numerous training centres for athletes, for coaches too, and the 
result was seen here,' said the former national team boss.

'German football is the perfect base and we now have a chance to rethink, revise and invest in better training of athletes.

'We
 need to improve and focus on training athletes from the clubs and give 
full attention to it, provide good structure and train good 
professionals.'

Brazil will face the loser of Wednesday's semi-final between Holland and Argentina in a third-place play-off on Saturday.
