Internet shopping giant Amazon fired a company that allegedly employed security staff with neo-Nazi links to intimidate its foreign workers.

HESS security was linked to the country's far-right by an investigation made by German television documentary makers

Amazon came under fire for using the firm after German film makers filmed black-clad guards with military haircuts, who are employed to keep Amazon’s over 5,000 foreign employees in check.

The film, broadcast on Germany’s ARD television channel, investigated the treatment of workers brought in as temporary staff at the company’s centres in Bad Hersfeld, Konstanz and Augsburg and unveiled a culture of threats and bullying.

Backlash: Amazon was criticised for using HESS security, whose staff 'threatened' foreign workers dressed in 'neo-Nazi uniform', a documentary claims

The world's biggest online retailer said the security service in question would no longer be used by the company, 'effective immediately', according to CNN.

'As a responsible employer of approximately 8,000 salaried logistics employees, Amazon has zero-tolerance for discrimination and intimidation and expects the same from every company we work with,' the company said.

The temporary staff come from across Europe for seasonal work at packing and distribution centres and stay in budget hotels and youth hostels where the HESS Security guards patrol.

The boot-wearing guards dress in uniforms from designer brand Thor Steinar, a label which carries strong neo-Nazi connotations,

The brand has been banned by both the German parliament and the Bundesliga football association and Amazon themselves stopped selling it in 2009 due to its symbolic far-right message.

The ARD documentary show the security guards searching bedrooms and kitchen at the foreign workers’ accommodation, allegedly frisking them for bread rolls when they leave breakfast in the morning.

‘They tell us they are the police here,’ a Spanish woman said.

Hensel European Security denied any connection with far-right radicalism and pointed out it has a  high proportion of immigrant workers of various religions.

Accused: Amazon allegedly employ the guards to patrol the hostels and budget hotels where their foreign workers stay near Bad Hersfeld, Germany

The documentary makers went undercover at one of the budget hotels used by Amazon for their staff and witnessed the brutal ways of HESS Security first hand. 

ARD made further accusations against HESS Security, claiming its name is a reference to prolific Nazi Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man, alleging that its director is associated with convicted neo-Nazis and football hooligans.

Due to their temporary status, workers can be fired at will and many are paid less than they were promised.

Amazon has faced a number of accusations about conditions at its warehouses in both the U.S. and Europe. A Financial Times report into an Amazon warehouse in the UK found workers often had to walk between seven and 15 miles each day.
