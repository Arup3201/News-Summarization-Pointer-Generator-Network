Former National Security Agency chief Michael Hayden was heckled at the Conservative Political Action Conference after he called himself an 'unrelenting libertarian'. 

Hayden was at the conference on Friday for a debate with Fox News senior judicial analyst and libertarian judge Andrew Napolitano, which was moderated by Fox Business Network's Lou Dobbs.

At one point in the debate, Hayden, who also used to head the CIA, said: 'Let's talk about facts. The judge is an unrelenting libertarian.' His comment was followed by a large applause from the audience. 

But when he added, 'So am I', the crowd booed and laughed, with many people shouting 'No, you're not!'

All applause from the conservative audience stopped as Hayden gave reasoning into why he considers himself a libertarian.

'I am an unrelenting libertarian who's also responsible for four decades of his life for another important part of [the Constitution], the part that says "provide for the common defense,"' he said.

Hayden's comments came after Napolitano told the audience they should be 'outraged' by NSA's surveillance programs, first revealed in 2012 by whistleblowers including Edward Snowden. 

Napolitano warned the crowd that the government had the power to turn on people's phones, read texts and listen to conversations. 

'We are in a twilight era where freedom is diminishing,' the judge told the audience. 

Hayden said in his followup: 'If NSA were even capable of doing what the judge has outlined for you we wouldn't have be having a debate here today. There would be nothing to argue about.'

Later into the debate, Napolitano asked the former NSA chief: 'Does the head of NSA have the constitutional legal authority to move the line between privacy and surveillance?'

Several audience members began yelling 'no', and Dobbs turned to Hayden, telling him the crowd response was 'a clue how they'd like you to answer'.

'The accusations fit on a bumper sticker but reality takes a little bit longer,' Hayden said, going on to say that while targeting foreigners, the NSA is required to withhold information collected about US citizens, according to the Daily Dot.

'So in other words, foreign terrorist, "Abu Akmad bin Bad Guy" was talking to a known US person. We minimize the US identity to protect your privacy, unless of course, the identity of the US is absolutely essential to the intelligence value of the intercept in the first place,' he said.

Hayden downplayed NSA's spy programs throughout the debate while side-stepping Napolitano's  main claim - that seizing an American's property unreasonably, through correspondence and data, without probable cause, violates the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.

Hayden failed to respond to Napolitano's main argument, that seizing an American's property without probable cause violates the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. The former NSA  chief has said in the past that privacy is a line that people must 'continuously negotiate'

At one point, Hayden said the debate was 'beginning to feel like an away game'.

This is not the first time Hayden as spoken out about the NSA, rights of privacy and hacking. 

In January during a speech at Washington and Lee University, the former chief discussed what constitutes as a probable search under the Fourth Amendment, according to The Atlantic. 

Hayden said that Americans have a duty to reveal their ingoing and outgoing calls as well as their internet activity. 

'Privacy is the line we continuously negotiate between ourselves as unique creatures of God and ourselves as social animals,' he said. 

'In the first category we have a right to keep things to ourselves. And in the second category we have a responsibility to reveal things about ourselves to the community for the greater good.'
