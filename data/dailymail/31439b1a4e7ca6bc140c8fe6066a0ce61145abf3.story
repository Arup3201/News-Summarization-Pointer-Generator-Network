Back to basics: Jeremy Hunt will today announce that trainee nurses will have to work as a healthcare assistant or support worker first

Student nurses are to be forced to work for a year as healthcare assistants to improve compassion in the NHS.

The back-to-basics approach comes amid claims that many trainee nurses, educated to degree-level, consider themselves ‘too posh to wash’.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will today announce that trainee nurses who want NHS funding will have to work as a healthcare assistant or support worker first.

He will insist ‘hands-on caring experience’ is just as important as academic training.

Other measures in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Stafford Hospital will include: 

A new chief inspector of hospitals to oversee an inspection system modelled on schools watchdog Ofsted

A statutory ‘duty of candour’ on hospitals and GP surgeries to stop them concealing mistake

A ban on gagging clauses preventing NHS whistleblowers from speaking out

An ‘elderly care tsar’ to protect the interests of older people in care homes

A new criminal offence to prevent managers fiddling figures such as waiting times and death rates

Last year the Care Quality Commission delivered a damning verdict on the state of the NHS.

It found 15 per cent of hospitals failed to meet national standards on ensuring patients had enough food and drink and 10 per cent did not treat people with dignity and respect. 

Inspectors found examples of nurses treating patients as ‘objects’, failing to close curtains when they were carrying out personal tasks, talking over patients and speaking to them in a ‘condescending or dismissive way’. 

Many hospitals had out-of-reach call bells or staff who failed to answer them in a reasonable time.

The Daily Mail has highlighted the failure of some nurses to care for patients as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

In a Commons statement today, Mr Hunt will call for a fundamental change in the culture of the NHS.

Students seeking NHS funding for nursing degrees will be required to work for up to a year as a healthcare assistant or support worker.

The scheme could be extended beyond nursing in the future, meaning doctors would have to spend time learning hands-on care.

Ministers will also publish a code of conduct for healthcare support workers, with clear requirements on behaviour and attitude.

Mr Hunt said: ‘Frontline, hands-on caring experience and values need to be equal with academic training.

‘These measures are about recruiting all staff with the right values and giving them the training they need to do their job properly, so that patients are treated with compassion.’

A series of measures will be enforced in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Stafford Hospital

Insiders say the new chief inspector of hospitals, who will become the most powerful figure in the NHS, is expected to rate hospitals and GP practices as outstanding, good, needing improvement or poor.

One third of the entire score will be based on patient experience – the extent to which patients would recommend a service to friends and family.

Ministers will also create an ‘elderly care tsar’ to protect the interests of older people in care homes and challenge institutions which  perform badly in the new Ofsted-style ratings.

Ministers are also expected to announce that hospitals and GP surgeries which hide mistakes that lead to patients being harmed will be punished.

All healthcare providers in the NHS will be subject to a new ‘duty of candour’. 

The Francis Report into the Stafford Hospital scandal called for it to apply to both institutions and individuals such as doctors, nurses and managers.

But it is understood that the Health Secretary has rejected the call for the duty to apply to individuals.Instead, only NHS trusts and GP surgeries as a whole will be held responsible and could perhaps face fines.

David Cameron insisted yesterday the NHS had to go ‘back to basics’ in the wake of Mid Staffs.

‘In the end it’s all about making sure we get back to basic thoughts in the NHS – about standards of care, about care attention for patients and making sure we do right by them. That is the key,’ he said.

Roger Goss, of the pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘Nurses at present are being told by their Royal College that theirs is now a degree profession on a par with doctors, so they think: “Why should I wipe someone’s bottom? Why should I make sure they have a shower? I’m far too posh to wash – or to care”.

‘It was a bad day for patients when someone decided nursing was a degree profession. It’s not, it’s a vocation.’
