A family claim a restaurant refused to blend food for their severely disabled son because it would break health and safety rules.

Ryan Moss, 17, has a severe form of quadriplegic cerebral palsy and cannot eat solid foods.

His family had visited a branch of Zizzi in Manchester's Trafford Centre on Wednesday and ordered a bowl of pasta for the teenager.

Bemused: Chris and Paula King said the actions of the restaurant could stop other families with disabled children like Ryan going out to eat in the future

Distress: Chris King was left angry when restaurant chain Zizzi refused to blend up severely disabled stepson Ryan's pasta at its branch in Manchester

They always carry a hand-held blender when they eat out but staff refused to use the device on the dish.

When Ryan's step-dad Chris King, 49, challenged the restaurant manager he was told using the blender would breach health and safety rules.

Chris told the Manchester Evening News: 'I was more shocked than anything else.

'Wherever we go, Ryan goes. Whatever we eat, Ryan eats.

Offending venue: Zizzi in Manchester's Trafford Centre. The chain has apologised

'Some families with special needs children would come up against a hurdle like this and it would put them off eating again.'

Ryan's mum Paula Moss, 46, added: 'Things like this shouldn't happen in this day and age.'

Zizzi bosses have since apologised for the incident, saying they were sorry for any distress caused.

A spokesperson said: 'We strive to offer the very best customer service at all of our restaurants and are looking into this incident as a matter of urgency to ensure levels are maintained in the future.'
