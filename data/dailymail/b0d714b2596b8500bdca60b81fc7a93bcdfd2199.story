The Smithsonian collection contains some of the world’s most precious natural specimens and historical artefacts, from prehistoric fossils to Lincoln’s life mask and Amelia Earhart’s air suit, but it is impossible to put them all on display.

Now the museums have embarked on an ambitious project to catalogue important pieces from their collections in 3D and you can browse exhibits online from the comfort of your armchair.

The X3D collection features objects that highlight different applications of 3D capture and printing, and it is envisioned that the archived digital items will be used for research, education and conservation.

The X3D collection features objects from the Smithsonian collection  that highlight different applications of 3D capture and printing, including a cosmic Buddha. The statue is covered in low-relief etching that can be most clearly seen using 3D scanning technology

Objects among those scanned in 3D are a woolly mammoth fossil and the Wright Flyer, which is the first successful powered aircraft, designed and built by the Wright brothers, who flew it four times in December 1903 in North Carolina.

The scan of the aircraft allows users to explore the fine details of the artefact, so they have a new way of understanding the principles of flight without visiting the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.

A Cosmic Buddha, on show at the Freer and Sackler Galleries, also in Washington DC, enables people to see the amazing relief etchings, of which scholars have traditionally made rubbings to study.

Like all fully enlightened beings, the life-size limestone figure is wrapped in the simple robe of a monk, but what makes the exhibit exceptional is the narrative scenes that cover its surface, which are based upon the lives of the historical Buddha.

Experts said 3D scanning alongside other imaging techniques, can give more clarity to the designs.

To capture the detail of a large whale fossil, Smithsonian palaeontologists documented skeletons from a site in Chile’s Atacama Desert to get data about the arrangement and condition of the skeletons before they were removed.

The Smithsonian X 3D explorer contains a number of tools for examining the objects so that users can rotate exhibits, such as the National History Museum’s Woolly Mammoth, take measurements and adjust colour and lighting to see detail as well as possible.

The iconic mammal of the Ice Age which went extinct 10,000 years ago can be viewed in 3D. The scan of the composite skeleton allows scientists to study the biomechanics and palaeobiology of very large mammals, whose bones are cumbersome and logistically difficult to manipulate in real life. 

The 3D model of Kansas-born Amelia Earhart’s flight suit allows people to look inside to see the manufacturer, Arnold, Constable & Company, of Paris and New York’s label.

Ms Earhart became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by plane I 1928, accompanying pilot Wilmer Stultz in a Fokker tri-motor from Newfoundland to Wales.

In 1932 she flew alone, from Newfoundland to Ireland and earned worldwide acclaim by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.

A copy of a cast of Lincoln’s gaunt face that was taken a day before his 56th birthday by sculptor Clark Mills, has been recorded with a 3D scanner.

Life masks were popular in the 19th Century and throughout the Civil War Lincoln wanted to make himself visible to the American people and show how the war had aged and tired him.

A ‘storytelling’ feature on the website means that visitors to the website can take guided tours of objects with Smithsonian curators.

Günter Waibel, the director of the 
Institution’s Digitisation Programme Office said the 3D technology is 
being used to make museum collections and scientific specimens more 
widely available for anyone to use and study.

‘Smithsonian X 3D explorer and the initial objects we scanned are the first step in showing how this technology will transform the work of the Smithsonian and other museums and research institutions,’ he said.

The Smithsonian collection comprises 137million objects, artworks and specimens and capturing the entire collection in 3D at a rate of one item every minute would take over 260 years if experts worked around the clock.

The scan gives an insight into the excavation of a whale fossil from Cerro Ballena, a palaeontological site in Chile. Smithsonian experts captured vital data about the arrangement and condition of the skeletons discovered before they were moved

The group of museums aim to digitalise 10 per cent of their collections, just one per cent of which are on display to the public.

The project will enable people to examine rare archived items they have never been able to see before, which will also benefit scientists and researchers.

The explorer of Africa was not a skilled shooter and missed a lion, resulting in his arm being mauled, before his assistant felled the beast.The gun in this model is not that same shotgun, but it was Livingstone's at the time of his death from dysentery in 1873
