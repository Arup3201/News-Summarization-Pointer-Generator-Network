Groupon's quirky former CEO, Andrew Mason, has been working hard on a new music album since he was ousted from the online deals company in February.

The seven-song album, Hardly Workin’, released this week drops business knowledge on listeners with tracks such as The Way to Work, My Door is Always Open and the hip-hop influenced Stretch. The latter begins ‘we all know that you gotta have goals every quarter’.

Groupon's failure to meet such goals was part of the reason the 32-year-old Mason was fired.

Fired: Mason was dismissed as CEO from Groupon in February this year

His ouster had been expected for months given investor concerns about the troubled company's declining stock price and financial problems. 

Although Groupon pioneered the daily deals business, it spawned many copycats and faced worries that people are tiring of the restaurant, spa and Botox deals that Groupon built its business on.

Mason, a former punk band keyboardist, calls the album ‘motivational business music’. It is available for $9.99 on iTunes and is also streamed on Spotify.

Reviews of the album have been mixed, with one comment on iTunes calling it 'hilarious'.

Another user says: 'Andrew Mason is famous for being a prankster. And I'm pretty sure no self-respecting man would put out this kind of music seriously.'

'I'm debating whether or not this is great or terrible. I find it a little ironic, some of the lyrics. I think I like it but dude...at least become CEO of the record label,' reads another comment.

Andrew Mason founded Groupon in 2008 with the concept of selling deals to local businesses.

In late 2010 it was reported that Groupon’s annual revenue was $800 million.

In December that year Groupon turned down a $6 billion acquisition bid from Google.

In 2012 Mason was named ‘Worst CEO of the Year’ by CNBC due to his ‘goofball antics’.

Mason was fired as Groupon's CEO on February 28, 2013 after the company fell far short of the profit mark.

In a letter to Groupon employees on the day of his dismissal, Mason wrote, ‘As CEO, I am accountable’

In the months after his dismissal, Mason started work on his album, Hardly Workin’, which he released this week.

The seven-song album is available on iTunes and Spotify.

‘This album pulls some of the most 
important learnings from my years at the helm of one of the fastest 
growing businesses in history, and packages them as music,’ Mason wrote 
on his blog. 

‘Executives, mid-level management and front-line employees are all sure to find valuable takeaways.’

Here's the opening line: ‘If you're 
seeking business wisdom, you don't need no MBA, look no further than the
beauty that surrounds us every day.’

And it goes on from there. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were no music videos available on YouTube.

Mason, who studied music at Northwestern University, is married to folk singer, Jenny Gillespie. He founded Groupon Inc in 2008. 

To diversify its business, Groupon has expanded into product sales, payments services, restaurant reservations and other areas.

The Chicago-based company's stock price is has nearly doubled since Mason's firing.
