It looks like it started off with a curious critter hoping to make a friend and play in the snow, but as these pictures show, the the invitation was harshly rejected.

These two voles were captured fighting tooth and nail, tumbling through the ice and snow with their claws at the ready.

It appears one of the voles did not take lightly to the other entering its territory on Hokkaido Island, Japan, and a fight ensued. 

Tooth and claw: These two voles ended up locked in a fierce battle after starting a squabble in the snow

They're even cute when they're angry! As hard as you try to find them scary, it's impossible

Furry fury: The bigger vole appears to scream in pain, as the smaller one bites down on its back, taking friendship (and snowmen) firmly off the cards

Unwilling to share its space, the enraged rodents were then seen tumbling in the frozen fields of Hokkaido Island. 

Japanese wildlife photographer Masasugu Ohasi,  cape upon the altercation whilst out on a walk near his house on the island.

Despite being known for their timid nature, the voles paid no attention to Masasugu as they brawled in the snow.

Masasugu said: 'I was walking near my house when I noticed some movement in the snow.

'After taking a closer look, I noticed the voles wrestling, grappling and chasing one another.'  

Moment of suspension: The two voles tumble through the snow, hardly noticing that they fall of a (tiny) cliff

Kung-fu skills: As they land, the smaller vole throws the other off its back, continuing the fight

It all started so nice... A tiny vole peaks around a snow-covered rock on Hokkaido Island, Japan

'Do you wanna build a snowman?' He approaches the other vole, an innocent expression on his tiny face

'NO.' The other vole is clearly not a Frozen fan, and is not interested in construction of humanoid snowsculptures of any kind

'There was a small hole nearby that would be a perfect shelter for a little vole so I think they were fighting for territory.

'I also know that these fights become more commonplace in the winter as food and shelter become harder to find.

'Mice owners never house males together as they will often fight but in the wild it's a different story.

'The fight looks very cruel but rarely is a vole severely injured, it normally ends with one of them surrendering and escaping.

'It was very hard to keep track of them as they move so quickly, I believe this happens in the wild a lot but it is rare that someone gets the chance to photograph it.'
