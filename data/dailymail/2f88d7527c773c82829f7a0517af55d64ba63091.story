A soap opera fan has had her back covered with a tattoo of her hero Shane Richie.

Mandy Crowther, 46, of Chorley, Lancs., is obsessed with the EastEnders actor and already has pictures of  him plastered all over her Peugeot 306 Cabriolet convertible.

She has also decorated her home and wheelie bin with pictures of the star and has now added to her collection - with a large tattoo.

Shane Richie superfan Mandy Crowther is well and truly over the Moon after having a picture of her favourite actor tattooed on her back next to his signature

Mandy recently met Shane on a trip to London and he signed her back with his autograph.

She has now had the name permanently inked over alongside a picture of her favourite entertainer.

Mandy said: 'I've liked Shane for seven or eight years now. I just think he is ace and he is really lovely.

'I met him in a pub when I was in London which was great. That's how I got his signature - he signed my back in a pen.

'I travelled back with it and got a tattooist to go straight over it.'

The Shane Richie car has made Mandy a local celebrity but her youngest son Joshua isn't so keen to travel in the vehicle - especially when his friends are around.

Mandy Crowther has a great obsession with the EastEnders star, who plays the popular character Alfie Moon

Mandy paid £1,000 to have pictures of Shane plastered on her car. She also decorated her wheelie bin

Mandy said: 'Josh, I think, gets a bit embarrassed and he wants to wear a hat so nobody can tell. But he doesn't mind when he's alone and I nip him to the shop.'

Supported by her partner Andrew Barker, Mandy has plans to do something even bigger.

She added: 'I have loads of ideas running through my head but it's just hard to pin them down to what I actually want to do.'

Mandy's latest escapade has seen a portrait of Shane tattooed on her back along with his signature
