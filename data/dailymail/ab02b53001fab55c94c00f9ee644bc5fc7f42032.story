Former New South Wales premier Barry O'Farrell may have been one of the biggest scalps of the corruption inquiry into property developer donations for the Liberal Party but he insists that he 'is not the big man'.

The identity of the so-called 'big man' who was behind a massive donation remains a mystery after Mr O'Farrell not only denied it was him but also said he didn't know who the big man was.

Sidelined Police Minister Mike Gallacher and former Energy Minister Chris Hartcher have both told the Independent Commission Against Corruption that Mr O'Farrell was known as the 'big man'.

'Someone will always try and rort the system' Mr O'Farrell said outside the corruption inquiry into property developer donations to the NSW Liberal Party

Sidelined Police Minister Mike Gallacher called the former Premier various names including 'boss' and 'Barry' but never 'the big man' according to Mr O'Farrell

The inquiry has heard differing versions about just who the `big man' is, with some saying it was coal magnate Nathan Tinkler while others have suggested it was Mr O'Farrell

But the one-time leader of Liberal Party, who resigned after denying he'd received a $3000 bottle of win from a lobbyist, said he was called many things by Mr Gallacher but never 'the big man'.

'I don't know who the big man is,' Mr O'Farrell told the ICAC.

'What I do know is that in any meetings with Mr Gallacher, he either called me Barry, he either called me boss in that curious police jargon or if someone else was present, he would call me premier.'

The inquiry has heard differing versions about just who the `big man' is, with some saying it was coal magnate Nathan Tinkler while others have suggested it was Mr O'Farrell.

The `big man' term shot to prominence as a result of a December 2010 text message from disgraced Newcastle MP Tim Owen's campaign manager to Mr Gallacher asking 'how's our Big Man going with the $120k?' being tendered as evidence.

But the identity remains a mystery.

'I don't know who the big man is,' Mr O'Farrell told the ICAC. The corruption inquiry has led to nine Liberal Party MPs stepping down, including the former Premier

Mr Gallacher last week said he couldn't remember receiving the 'big man' text.

While giving evidence earlier in the inquiry, Mr Owen's former campaign manager said the `big man' was Mr Tinkler and that Mr Gallacher was 'making' the $120,000 donation happen.

Property developers, such as Mr Tinkler, have been banned from making political donations to NSW parties since 2009.

However, Mr Gallacher's lawyer has spent hours arguing the 'big man' was the former premier, who as Opposition Leader in late 2010 kept a close eye on campaign funding.

Mr Tinkler has also fronted the inquiry and said he knew nothing about the mysterious `big man'.

The $120,000 was allegedly being sought to fund 2011 election campaigns in the Hunter Valley.

But Mr O'Farrell said he wasn't directly involved in fundraising.

'The only fundraising activities I was engaged in relation to the Hunter was the usual events that I was asked to front up to attend,' he said.

Outside the commission, Mr O'Farrell said the record of the NSW Liberal Government since winning the 2011 election had been 'overshadowed by revelations of the actions of a very few people'.

'It's bitterly disappointing for me to see in the lead-up to that 2011 election campaign a small number of people decided to illegally raise funds and therefore detract from the efforts of the state Liberal government,' Mr O'Farrell said.

'That's what galling about this process.'

The former Premier said his party colleagues knew the rules.

'Yes the rules change but I would expect people to abide by those rule changes,' he said

He said as Premier he had given the ICAC record powers but added 'that someone will always try and rort the system'.
