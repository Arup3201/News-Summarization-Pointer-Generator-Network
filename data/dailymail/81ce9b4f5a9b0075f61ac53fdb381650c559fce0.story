She's the West Lothian singer who shot to fame after appearing on Britain's Got Talent and has sung for everyone from Barack Obama to the Queen.

But despite her impressive achievements, Susan Boyle, 53, says her life is not yet complete and has revealed that she plans to adopt a child, because 'I want to give a youngster what I didn’t have'.

Boyle, from Blackburn in West Lothian, is believed to have been considering the move for more than a year and believes taking on a youngster would be 'a way of giving back for me'.

According to the Scottish Sunday Mail, the singer added: 'I have so much love to give. I want to adopt a child who doesn’t have much, who I can really give something to. It’s a way of giving back for me.

'I have been considering it for a year. I love children, I always have but I couldn’t have them. I want to give a youngster what I didn’t have.

'We’ll have to see what social services say, but it would make me so happy. 

'I know I’m single and 50-odd. People don’t think I’m serious when I say it, they have a giggle at me. Let’s see.'

Boyle, whose sixth album Hope is due out next month, is reported to have seen a relative care for foster children.

Success: Since shooting to fame in 2009, Susan Boyle has sold more than 19 million albums worldwide

While the singer said fostering would be 'great', she added: 'You have to give them back, and that’s what I would hate. With adoption, you don’t have that wrench.' 

Boyle, whose debut public appearance on Britain's Got Talent in 2009 was watched by more than 10 million viewers, is worth an estimated £22m and has sold more than 19 million albums worldwide.

Despite her success, she still lives in the council home she was brought up in, a four-bedroom semi which she purchased in 2010.

Boyle, who in 2013 revealed that she has Asperger's Syndrome, also remains an active member of her local church and is often seen visiting elderly parishioners.
