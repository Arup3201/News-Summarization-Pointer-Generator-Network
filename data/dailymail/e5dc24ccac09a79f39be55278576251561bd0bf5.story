Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini will allow striker John Guidetti to return to Holland in order to kickstart a career that has so far failed to live up to its early hype.

Feyenoord and Ajax are among several European clubs who have enquired about the 22-year-old Swede, above, whose only first-team appearance for City came in a League Cup tie against West Brom in 2010.

Guidetti secured Premier League experience for Stoke last season, but failed to sparkle on a loan move.

Outcast: John Guidetti could be set for a return to Holland after failing to impress at Manchester City

Finding his feet: Guidetti shone in Holland with Feyenoord, but hasn't kicked on since

With Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo absent in pre-season, Guidetti has had another chance to shine.

But when the duo return it is expected he will be out in the cold again and swiftly moved on.
