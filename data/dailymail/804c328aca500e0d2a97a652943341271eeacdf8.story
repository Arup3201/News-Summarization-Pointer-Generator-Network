A Tampa woman tried to manipulate her dead daughter's face into a smile after she allegedly shot her and her teenage brother in a meticulously planned double murder, a doctor told jurors today.

During the seventh day of Julie Schenecker's trial in Hillsborough County Court, two doctors said the 53-year-old former military wife had a 
plan to kill her children, and cited her journal writings that detailed 
the plan as evidence.

She 
is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of 
Calyx, her 16-year-old daughter and Beau, her 13-year-old son. The teens
 were shot to death while her now ex-Army officer husband was on a 
10-day deployment to the Middle East.

On Wednesday, Dr. Randy Otto, a mental health expert called by the prosecution, told the juryÂ  
Schenecker told him that she tried to 
manipulate Calyx's mouth into a smile after she shot her children. She also covered both the teens' 
bodies with blankets and kissed them, Otto said.

The
 doctors also said the fact that she drove to a gun shop, told a clerk 
she wanted a gun so she could protect herself and then returned 
following a three-day waiting period was further proof she intended to kill her children.

Defense
 attorneys say Schenecker suffered from bipolar disorder with psychotic 
features and depression, and that she was insane at the time of the 
January 2011 deaths.

Experts supporting their case claim Schenecker bought the gun with the intent to kill herself rather than her kids.

They also said that Schenecker was suffering from 'delusions' that she was 'saving' her children from embarrassment or killing them to save them from future harm or mental illness.

Upon
 questioning from Schenecker's lawyer, Dr. Donald Taylor did say that 
her mental condition was on a downward spiral in the months leading up 
to the crime.

'With the benefit of hindsight, it's clear that her mental condition was deteriorating,' he said, adding that she should have been committed to a mental health facility.

Yet he maintained that despite that, Schenecker knew what she was doing was wrong.

Defense attorneys rested their case on
 Tuesday. Schenecker told the judge she won't testify on her behalf. 
Closing arguments could take place Thursday.

The
 opinions of the prosecution's medical experts comes after a 
psychologist testified in Schenecker's defense Monday, telling the court
 she was 'without a doubt' insane at the time of the slayings.

Dr Eldra Soloman said he diagnosed the mother as bipolar after spending 20 hours with Schenecker, and reviewing her medical history.

'I think without a doubt that she was insane at the time of the shooting and during the week prior to the shooting,' Dr Solomon told the jury. 'Even psychopaths don't kill their own children.'

'They may be able to kill other people's children, but sane people have it wired in their DNA to protect their children,' she added.

Dr Soloman says Schenecker developed severe mental illness after being molested at the age of seven and started to think about suicide when she was just 12 years old.

Six months before the killings, Schenecker went off her medications, resulting in a 'downward spiral' which ended with Calyx and Beau's deaths.

Around that time, Schenecker started behaving bizarrely, telling her therapist that she wanted to get pregnant at the age of 49 so she could immediately give the child up for adoption.

Dr Soloman believes Schenecker wanted to commit suicide, but didn't want to leave her children motherless - fearing that her daughter was becoming bi-polar and that her son would be molested just like her.

Failed plan: Schenecker planned to kill herself after shooting dead kids Calyx, 16 (left), and Beau, 13 (right). But the prescription pills she took didn't prove fatal and simply put her to sleep. Her husband was deployed in the Middle East at the time. The two have since divorced

So she decided to kill herself and take 'her children with her to heaven' in order to protect them from the evils of the world.

After shooting dead her two children, Schenecker took several pills which put her to sleep - but did not prove lethal.

Schenecker's husband and the father of her children, Army Col Parker Schenecker, was deployed in the Middle East at the time and the two have since divorced.

When she woke up the next morning, Dr Soloman said Schenecker was very upset.

'She said she was very angry at herself because she failed,' Solomon said. 'She was very upset because she didn't succeed at killing herself.'

Forensic psychiatrist Dr Michael Maher also testified and agrees that Schenecker was legally insane at the time of the shootings.

'My conclusion is she knew what she was doing ... but she did not know it was wrong. She believed she was protecting her children from something that was terribly horrible; she believed she was going to stay with her children and bring them with her to heaven, and it was a part of her necessary duty as a mother to do this,' Dr Maher said.

However, the prosecution has been arguing that the slayings were premeditated, and not the result of a mental breakdown.

The jury previously heard recordings of Schenecker telling detectives that her teens were mean and that she hoped they were dead just hours after their bodies were found.

'I just topped over. The last straw,' Schenecker said in the interview, 'My daughter, the 16-year-old, is mouthy. She calls me names.'

She told the detective that she had long thought about suicide.

'I feel horrible. I just feel horrible,' she said. 'But I've been thinking about doing this for a long time.'

Later, the detective asked her where her kids were. She said that Calyx was in her bed where she had placed her after the shooting, and that Beau was in the family's minivan where she had shot him.

'I hope they're dead,' Schenecker said to police Detective Gary Sandel. 'What do you think?'

'They're dead,' Det Sandel replied.

Tampa Police officer Fred Arnold testified that Schenecker's mood was 'jovial' the day of her arrest.

'She wasn't sad or anything like that,' Arnold said. 'She wanted me to give her my gun so she could finish the job.'

Schenecker also wrote about her 'disrespectful' children in her journals but Dr Soloman said those were merely 'ramblings'.

Schenecker is facing two counts of first-degree murder and has plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

If convicted, she will face a life prison sentence without parole; prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty.

If acquitted by reason of insanity, the mother would be committed to a hospital until she is no longer a danger to herself or others.
