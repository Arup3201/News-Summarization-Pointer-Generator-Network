From rubbing watercress on the gums to stuffing bread into the ear, there is a cure for virtually any ailment.

These bizarre remedies date back almost 350 years and are found in an antique book to be auctioned off later this month. 

The remarkably well-preserved tome, titled A Friend To The Sick - The Englishman’s Preservation, is expected to sell for more than £500 and reveals age-old secrets to good health, such as eating burnt birds and drinking liquor.

An antique book has revealed bizarre cures for the common cold and other illnesses from almost 350 years ago. Titled A Friend To The Sick - The Englishmans Preservation, it was written by Royal Physician William Sermon (Auctioneer and valuer Isabell Murtough is pictured with the book)

It was written in 1673 by Royal Physician, William Sermon, who was a physician of Charles II.

In the book, Dr Sermon states: 'Sickness is a convulsion which will most 
commonly deprive the patient of reason and sense, caused by tough flegm 
which doth obstruct the passage of the spirit of the brain.'

Another suggested cure is to: 'Take young
swallows, burn them in their feathers, altogether in a new earthenware 
pot, covered very close, add thereto as much castor and beat them well 
together and put in to a glass vessel and let it stand three days after 
which distill it in a glass for patient to take.

'With earache, take a loaf made with one part of caraway seeds, and cut it through the middle and apply it to the ears.'

And for a patient suffering from 
toothache, Dr Sermon writes: ‘To make rotten teeth sound, take the juice
of water cresses and white wine in equal measure, mix them together and
rub the teeth and gums therewith.’

He adds that ‘the ashes of tobacco 
is of excellent use to cleanse the teeth and to make them white’.

One suggested cure is to: 'Take young swallows, burn them in their feathers... add thereto as much castor and beat them well together and put in to a glass vessel and let it stand three days, after which distill it in a glass for patient to take'

The honoured doctor also recommends 'the juice of water cresses and white wine and the ashes of tobacco' to cleanse teeth and make them white

Dr Sermon died six years after his book was published at the age of 50 and the medical journal was a hidden treasure until it was discovered in a box in a routine 
house clearance in Derbyshire.

Auctioneer Charles Hanson, a regular on BBC1’s Bargain Hunt, will oversee the sale of the book.

He said: 'At the end there are some letters to Dr Sermon, who at the time was referred to as a ‘noble’ and ‘honoured’ doctor. indeed, he was doctor to Charles II.

'It describes "the causes, symptoms and cures" for a number of "occult and dangerous diseases".

'However, I suspect if Dr Sermon was alive now and had noted the advances in modern medicine, he may withdraw some of his advice!

Dr Sermon, who was a physician of Charles II, also recommends blowing the powder of eggshells up into the nostrils as one cure. His book is expected to fetch £500 at auction later this month

'It was uncovered in a box of assorted items in routine house clearance. It is surprising what history from homes can still be unearthed.'

He added: '[This book] offers a fascinating snapshot into medical advice in the 17th century.

'It is a wonderful find because, despite almost being 350 years old, it is still in its original leather binding and is extremely well preserved.‘

The book will be sold at Hansons Auctioneers in Derby on October 24.
