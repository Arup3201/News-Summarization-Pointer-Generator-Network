A California elementary school teacher is being charged with burglary and possession of a controlled substance after authorities allegedly saw surveillance footage that shows her stealing medication from special needs children.

Sheri Haselhuhn, a 40-year-old mother and wife with 14 years of teaching experience, is also allegedly seen in the footage swallowing the medication.

Police were first alerted by officials at Delta Charter school in Clarksburg on Tuesday after one of the student's medication came up short.

'On Wednesday afternoon deputies were notified by the school that they had located suspicious activity in the footage they reviewed,'Â  Yolo County Sheriff Capt. Larry Cecchettinis told the Daily Democrat.

'A deputy responded and reviewed the footage, dated April 28, 2014. It showed Haselhuhn removing the medication and ingesting it.'

Haselhuhn was arrested in her West Sacramento home on Wednesday.

The medication has not been identified. Nor have authorities revealed whether the student whose medication she stole was a current pupil of Haselhuhn's.

Meanwhile, parents of her current and former students expressed their shock and disbelief as news spread of her arrest.

'She taught my son how to read,' Linda McCapes, whose son was taught by Sheri Haselhuhn, told CBS Sacramento. 'She was nice.'

The school's principal did what he could to move the focus from Haselhuhn to the students of Delta Elementary Charter.

'I think the most important message to our families is that the safety of our children is No. 1 priority, and we want all our families to know that's why we notified law enforcement and took immediate action,' principal Steve Lewis told CBS News.

Haselhuhn was released Thursday on $20,000 bail.Her next court appearance is scheduled for June 9.
