The NSW Police Force has located four-year-old boy Brae Bongiorno

A four-year-old boy who went missing on Monday after he was picked up by his father from a childcare centre in northern NSW has been located safe and well.

Police stopped a white Toyota Hilux 4WD on Bent Street at South Grafton just before 7.30am on Tuesday.

Brae Bongiorno was found in the back of the car and showed no apparent signs of injury.

The four-year-old boy was reunited with his mother.

Brae was taken from the childcare centre in Grafton, near the border between NSW and Queensland, at 3pm on Monday.

Police launched an urgent appeal for help from the public after the boy was allegedly abducted from the centre.

On Tuesday a 29-year-old man was arrested at the scene, located near to the childcare centre.

The man was taken to Grafton Police Station where he is continuing to assist with inquiries. No charges have been laid.
