Construction has begun on a luxury five-star hotel being built INSIDE a 100-metre deep, water-filled abandoned quarry in China at the base of the Tianmenshan Mountain.

The £345million cave hotel in the Songjiang District has been designed by British-based firm Atkins and will have 380 rooms over 19 storeys - two of which will be underwater. 

The rest of the InterContinental Shimao hotel will be built into the mountainous landscape and guests will be able to do watersports on the lake and use the nearby cliffs for rock-climbing and bungee jumping.

It is expected to take around three years to build and guests could be staying in the resort by 2015 - with rooms likely to cost around £200 a night.

The two underwater floors will have an aquarium with glass walls that look out onto an underwater restaurant and guest rooms.

A swimming pool and a sports centre will also be built inside the hotel as well as several restaurants, a banqueting hall and conference rooms for business meetings.

Although the guest rooms will vary in size, they are expected to start from around £200 a night.

Atkins has designed the structure to blend in with the landscape using an eco-friendly green roof planted with various trees.

Li Xuyang, a senior manager for Shimao Group told Shortlist: 'Two stories will be built underwater, 17 will be within the cave and two more will be above ground.

'The roof of the hotel will only be 15 m above the cave.

'The idea was to take advantage of this unique land form and to create a garden growing in the air.

People could view the hundred-meter high waterfall from their room window.

'The hotel is part of the larger project to build Shimao Shanghai Wonderland, a large-scale theme park.'
