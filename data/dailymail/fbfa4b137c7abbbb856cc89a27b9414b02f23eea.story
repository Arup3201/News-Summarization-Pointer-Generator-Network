She's the reality TV star with a serious passion for fashion and now Casey Batchelor is channeling her love of clothes into her debut range.

The Big Brother star and glamour model has teamed up with Honeyz.com to launch a line of boho frocks, paisley prints and the kind of bodycon shapes she loves to wear on a night out with her famous friends.

Speaking about her new drop, which was inspired by the seventies influence spotted on the SS15 catwalks, Casey told FEMAIL: 'I'm very excited about the launch of my first range. Every girl has a clothes obsession - and I am to the extreme!'.

'I have so many clothes it's ridiculous but looking good and feeling good in our clothes is a big deal. Wearing the right clothes can make you go from feeling just OK to feeling great, which was the feeling behind my collection.' 

Casey, who has her own  walk-in-wardrobe at home, says that launching her own range of clothes and accessories is a 'dream come true'.

Casey says that since having a breast reduction, she can wear different types of clothing and has been able to experiment with her style 

The reality TV star, who recently appeared on Celebrity Dinner Date, made sure to include lots of mix-and-match pieces in the range to ensure her fans could shake up their style depending on their mood.

'It's always good to have a variety of styles and and looks to hand,' she said. 'But remember to always keep it classy!'. 

Casey certainly shows her fans how to work the looks - and showcases her trim figure in the campaign shots.

'My figure has changed since I've had my breast reduction,' she explained. 'It's allowed me to wear different types of clothing, which has been really nice to experiment with different styles. 

'Before I would always have to wear a bra, whereas now I can get away with not wearing one with certain items. Also having smaller boobs doesn't make me so top heavy anymore, which is more flattering in clothes.'

Casey loved creating her own fashion range so much that she already has her sights set on designing a shoe collection. 

'Shoes are my weakness,' she said. 'If I go to buy one pair, I always walk away with at least three or four. I would love to join up with a designer and properly design my own range, from heels to boots to wedges. I am definitely a shoe-a-holic.'

The star isn't limited to just fashion design and has been busy shooting a film called Bonded By Blood, which is out later this year.

'I'm very excited for you all to see this because people don't know that I am a trained actress. This is going to be a great way for people to see me in a different light as it's a very serious role - it's actually based on a true story,' she said.

'I also have my radio show, which I co-present with Sam Dowler every Saturday on Vibe107.6. It's lots of fun and we talk about lots of showbiz gossip and the events and premieres we have been to that week.

'I am hoping for my acting to take off and that is what I'm focussing on so who knows; in five years maybe I will be in Hollywood!'.

The preview of Casey's Closet for Honeyz.com will launch today. The full collection will be available from 1st April.
