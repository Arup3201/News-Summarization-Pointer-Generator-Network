Former deputy speaker of the House of Commons Nigel Evans has appeared in court this morning accused of a string of sex offences.

Evans, 55, who was charged with two counts of indecent assault, five of sexual assault and one of rape earlier this month, spoke only to confirm his name, address and that he understands the charges during a ten minute hearing at Preston Magistrates' Court.

Granted bail until a preliminary hearing at Preston Crown Court next month, Evans told reporters as he left the hearing: 'I'm going back to Westminster to work now, thank you.'

His bail was granted on condition he does not approach directly or indirectly named witnesses.

On September 10, Evans was charged with the rape of a man between March 29 and April 1, 2013, five sexual assaults dating back to 2009 and two indecent assaults dating back to 2002.

The former Conservative stood down as deputy speaker in a speech in the House of Commons the day after the charges were brought.

He said he will continue to represent his Ribble Valley constituency in Lancashire but as an independent MP.

The decision to charge the openly-gay politician – a popular figure in Westminster – came after he was arrested for a third time.

Evans had originally said that he would 
not comment further on the allegations until the case was concluded when
 he appeared on the steps of Preston police station after he was 
charged.

But in an emotional address to the Commons the following day, he told how his impending court battle was the 'most painful' experience of his life alongside the death of his mother and brother.

He said: ‘Since these allegations, I have not been able to fully fulfil my duties in the chair, which left me in a land of limbo.

‘None of us were elected to the fine office of Member of Parliament to be put in that invidious position, unable to fully fulfil the reason why we were sent here.’

'This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life alongside the loss of my mother in 2009 and the loss of my brother earlier this year

‘Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.’

He had earlier said that he would 'robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal'.

Evans, from Pendleton, Lancashire, stepped aside from his deputy speaker duties after his arrest but had continued to work as an independent MP.

He was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was ‘tired of living a lie’.

He was a vice chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001. When Iain Duncan Smith became party leader in 2001, he was promoted to the shadow cabinet as shadow Welsh secretary - a post he held for two years.

Evans gave up the Tory whip when he became deputy speaker in 2010 and has said that he will not take the whip until 'after the conclusion of events'.

District Judge Jane Goodwin adjourned 
the case until October 4 when the former deputy speaker will appear for a
 preliminary hearing at Preston Crown Court.
