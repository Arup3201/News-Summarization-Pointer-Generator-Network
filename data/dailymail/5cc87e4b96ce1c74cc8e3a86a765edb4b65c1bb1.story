Persona non grata: Plastic surgeon Toby Mayer has been told he won't be needed at the charity polo match in which Prince William is playing

It's the hottest ticket in town.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are in Los Angeles this weekend and the great and good of the movie world and high society are hoping to schmooze them.

One of the highlights of their stay is set to be a charity polo match on Saturday.

But in the leafy surrounds of the Santa Barbara club where Prince William will be playing, there is already a storm brewing in one of their china teacups.

Beverley Hills plastic surgeon Toby Mayer has had his nose put out of joint after being told that, despite years of service tending to wounds on the touchline, his services will not be required.

Dr Mayer, 69, had been expecting to be the man with the spongebag ready to attend to a royal knee in the event of a coming-together in the middle of a chukka.

After sending out a press release and giving a series of interviews about his 'official' role, he received a call from the club's general manager, Ariana Nobel, saying he'd been 'deselected'.

Dr Mayer said: 'I'm extremely disappointed with the polo club and this foundation that after 30 years of service to the membership that I was treated this way.

'Ariana said, "They want to control the media". There's not supposed to be any interviews granted unless they tell you it's OK.'

Dr Mayer had boasted in the press release that he had been personally selected for the role by Buckingham Palace and that it was his responsibility to keep Prince William looking good.

The release read: 'As the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are embarking on a new life, keeping Prince William healthy and looking Hollywood, camera-ready, is of utmost importance.

'I'm honoured to be selected by Buckingham Palace to be the Beverly Hills surgeon given that it's such an esteemed privilege to keep his royal highness looking good.'

Ms Nobel and the event organisers said Dr Mayer had helped out at past matches, but would not be helping during Saturday's royal visit.

Ms Nobel said: 'Mayer was never confirmed as the plastic surgeon on site for the event.

'It seems as if he chose to assume he would be the doctor on site on the 9th since he has served as the doctor at many prior polo events at the Santa Barbara Polo Club.'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due to attend the event in support of the American Friends of The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry charity.

Geannie Sheller, president of the Polo Training Centre, said she had already contracted an emergency medical technician and ambulance for the event.

She said: 'We did not request a medical doctor or plastic surgeon to be present during the polo match.'

Dr Mayer, a long-time club member, regularly shuttles between his weekday office in Beverly Hills to play polo in Santa Barbara over the weekend.

The lush stretch of coastline two hours north of Los Angeles is nicknamed the American Riviera and has been home to celebrities including Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will arrive in Los Angeles on Friday for a two-day stay following their tour of Canada.

As well as a red-carpet Bafta event, the royal couple will visit the Inner-City Arts school on skid row and attend a job fair for veterans at Sony Studios in Culver City on Sunday before flying home.
