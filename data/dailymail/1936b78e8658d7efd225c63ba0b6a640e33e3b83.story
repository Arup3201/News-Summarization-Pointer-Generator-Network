Poisoned by carbon monoxide: Jeffrey Williams, 11, was found dead in room 225 of the Best Western Hotel because of a faulty pool water heater in June

The North Carolina mother who nearly died from a carbon monoxide leak in a hotel that claimed the life of her 11-year-old son spoke about the incident on ABC's 20/20 this week for the first time since the June 2013 tragedy. 

Jeffrey Lee Williams and his mother, 49-year-old Jeannie Williams were discovered unresponsive inside Room 225 of the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone at around 12.30pm on June 8.

The woman pulled through and later woke up at Watauga Medical Center, only to learn that her young son has died from carbon monoxide poisoning.

What the mother and son, in town to pick up Jeffrey's sister from a science camp, did not know when checking into the second-floor hotel room is that only two months earlier, an elderly couple had died there after being overcome by carbon monoxide gas seeping from a faulty pipe.

Last week, Damon Mallatere, the president of the company that owns the Boone inn, was indicted by a grand jury on three counts of involuntary manslaughter and assault inflicting seriously bodily injury in connection to the deaths of Jeffrey Williams, Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72.

In an exclusive interview with ABC's 20/20 airing tonight at 10pm, the boy's grieving mother said her last memory of her son is Jeffrey sitting on the edge of the bed and playing a game on his iPad. 

The following day, the family were supposed to pick up Mrs Williams' 17-year-old daughter from camp, but at night the woman felt nauseated and rushed to the bathroom.

Final moments: Mrs Williams the said her last memory of her son is of Jeffrey sitting on the edge of the bed and playing a game on his iPad

Three people died last year from carbon monoxide poisoning after staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone, North Carolina

‘I knew where I was,’ Williams recalled. ‘I was on the floor, but my phone was plugged in by the bed. I knew I needed to get help... I remember [being] on the floor reaching and trying to get to the door to open the door, and I couldn't. I couldn't get it. And then that's the last thing I remember.’

The next morning, Williams' teenage daughter became concerned when her mother and brother had failed to turn up at the appointed time and called the hotel to inquire after them.

A Best Western clerk went up to Room 225, where he discovered Jeffrey dead and his mother lying unconscious on the floor in the bathroom.

‘The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital room,’ Williams said. ‘I couldn't talk.’

Desperate to find out what happened to her son, Mrs Williams wrote a note to her husband, who then delivered the devastating news.

'That's when he told me that Jeffrey was with Jesus,' she said.

Unbeknownst to Jeannie Williams and 
her son, they were lodged in the same room where Washington couple Daryl and Shirley Mae 
Jenkins were discovered dead from carbon monoxide poisoning on April 16.

On a 911 tape, a concerned hotel clerk could be heard telling the dispatcher in June that the same thing happened just weeks earlier.

Damon Mallatere's company owns the ill-fated Boone motel, which is part of an international franchise, where police say a faulty swimming pool heater allowed 
carbon monoxide to seep into the motel room through a corroded pipe.

Mallatere’s attorney told the Charlotte Observer
 last week that he was 'extremely disappointed' that charges have been 
pressed against him instead of the gas company that converted the heater
 from propane to natural gas.

In
 an interview with ABC, Mallatere said that he made the decision to 
re-open Room 225 six weeks after the Jenkins couple's deaths because officials indicated to him that they had passed away from natural
 causes.

Dr.
 Brent Hall, Watauga County medical examiner, had a report on his desk 
that explained the reasons for the Jenkins' deaths, however their 
toxicology reports did not make it to Boone police until after Jeffrey 
Williams died two months later.

'I don't know why they didn't expedite 
them, but the thinking at the time was that it was not carbon monoxide,'
 said Chief Police Officer Dana Crawford.

When Jeffrey and his mother checked into the hotel, they did not know about the previous victims - nor did the police.

Toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning

Dr Hall suddenly resigned in November but he has not answered questions about when he received the results.

'I can’t speculate as to why we 
didn’t get them,' Police Chief Dana Crawford said, according to WSOC. 
Ms. Crawford said those documents could have saved the boy's life.

'I would like to think we would have 
been able to conclude and find the source of that carbon monoxide, and 
with that information, been able to rectify that whole situation before 
this happened,'

Ms Crawford said if her department knew 
there was a carbon monoxide death in the room, they would have worked 
with fire officials to find the leak.

She said it took investigators just hours to trace it back to a pool water heater after Williams’ death.

But just days after the elderly couple's death - and weeks before Jeanine and Jeffrey Williams checked into the hotel - there was another alarming incident suggesting that something was amiss.

Serene Solinski hosted a birthday party at the hotel for her 13-year-old daughter and her friends. The guests were lodged in Room 325, located directly above the accommodations where Mr and Mrs Jenkins had died three days prior.

In the course of the party, Solinksi recalled to ABC that most of the children became violently ill and were 'falling off like flies.'

The troubled mother alerted the front desk and was assured that the general manager will be notified of the situation.

Damon Mallatere was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday and faces three counts of involuntary manslaughter after three people died of carbon monoxide poisoning at a North Carolina hotel he owned

Mallatere has denied being told about Solinski's fraught stay by his staff. He also has told ABC that he did not know at the time that the hotel pool heater's exhaust pipe was severely damaged.

‘We never would've re-opened that room if we had any thoughts whatsoever that there was something wrong or that that would hurt somebody,’ Mallatare said.

According to ABC, photos of the conduit show that it was riddled with holes and propped up with a VHS tape and an ice bucket.

Mallatare pleaded not guilty and was released on $40,000 bond. He is expected to be arraigned February 17.

Jeanine Williams believes that her son could have been saved had the hotel bothered to install carbon monoxide detectors.

The family are planning to start a foundation encouraging hotels to install the life-saving devices and pushing for state laws that would make the detectors mandatory.

Mrs Williams also hopes that in sharing her tragic story, she would raise awareness of the silent, odorless and colorless killer that has robbed her of her son.  

‘One thing I'll never have… I won't have the mother and the groom dance,’ Williams said. ‘But I just take it one step at a time, and I just know I'll see him and I'll dance with him in heaven one day.’
