A half-deaf pensioner who annoyed her neighbours by constantly blasting out Bhangra music has been ordered to pay more than £2,000.

Satinder Kholi, 72, repeatedly ignored warnings about playing loud music from her house and back garden after being served a noise abatement notice in July 2013.

Magistrates heard she continually breached the order by playing Sound Asia FM tunes from her property in Kings Heath, Birmingham, at all hours of the day and night.

Yesterday, the pensioner was found guilty in her absence at Birmingham Magistrates Court of three offences under the Environmental Protection Act.

She was fined £400 and ordered to pay court costs of £1,747 as well as a £40 victim surcharge.

The court heard Birmingham City Council had already brought a case against Kholi and she was fined in September last year for playing loud music.

But she continued to blast out tunes from her radio and environmental health officers received more complaints about noise levels at her home.

An environmental health officer visited her home on July 30 last year and heard loud music coming from Ms Kholi's home.

A tape recorder was installed and recordings made over two days in August reached levels that constituted a 'statutory noise nuisance.'

On August 29, officers seized Ms Kholi's radio, television and laptop.

Birmingham magistrates heard she continually breached the noise abatement order she was served with in July 2013

She was charged with three counts of contravening or failing to comply with an abatement notice under Environmental Protection Act.

Councillor Barbara Dring, who chairs the city council's Licensing and Public Protection Committee, said: 'Our officers have received numerous complaints about loud music coming from Ms Kholi's home since April 2013 and she was served with a noise abatement notice in July 2013.

'However, officers continued to receive complaints and, as a result, seized audio equipment from her home on three occasions.

'Despite being asked to turn down the volume, she has repeatedly broken the terms of this notice and shown a lack of respect for her neighbours' welfare and wellbeing - so I am pleased to hear she's been found guilty of these offences.'

Her daughter Anita Mukherjee, 44, said her mother was partially deaf and was not bothering anybody with her music.

She added: 'It is just one neighbour who complained. My mother is deaf in one ear. She entitled to lead her life, she's not bothering anyone.

'Playing music in the day time doesn't hurt anyone. They also confiscated our LG TV, radio, laptop and about 50 music CDs, a DVD player and eight DVDs.

'She doesn't listen to music loudly or at antisocial hours.'
