More than 300,000 people are so poor they cannot afford to go bankrupt, a report warned today.

The Centre for Social Justice claimed thousands of people cannot even raise the £525 fee to go bust.

The think tank called for more community banks to help millions of people to access finance not available from the big high street chains.

Families need access to cheaper loans to help them to make ends meet, the CSJ said.

It calls for red-tape to be cut to allow credit unions to become Community Banks which offer more stable loans and banking services at cheaper rates and on better terms.

CSJ director Christian Guy said: ‘There is a growing group of people under intense pressure as a result of problem debt.

‘This debt rips into families and traps people on the edges of our society. Many don’t know where to turn.

‘Worse, people in poorer communities are effectively excluded from mainstream banking – hit hard by punitive fees, penalties and crippling debt.’

The report warns that the problem of people getting into money problems ‘appears to be getting worse’, with overall personal debt almost doubling in the past decade.

There are now 2.2 million more people estimated to be in need of debt advice than in 2011., the CSJ said.

The think tank said it had ‘heard from debt charities about the number of people who become trapped in debt… but are unable to afford the £700 (including a £525 deposit) required to apply for bankruptcy’.

Christians Against Poverty estimated that there are 315,000 people who are too poor to go bankrupt each year.

Official figures show young women are almost twice as likely to fall into personal insolvency as men of the same age.

In some parts of the country, more than one in every 1,000 women aged under 25 have gone bust.

They are buying designer clothes and other expensive goods as they try to emulate the rich and famous.

The growing level of bankruptcy and other financial problems is seen as a hangover of the credit crunch, and changing lifestyles which mean young women are more willing - and able - to take on debts.

The Insolvency Service’s figures show that last year 7.8 women aged 18 to 24 became insolvent for every 10,000 adults compared with a rate of 4.0 for men.

More women than men were also going bust in the 25-34 age group, although the difference was not so stark. The personal insolvency rate for women was 32.8 per 10,000 adults last year, while for men it was 25.6.

The figures, for England and Wales, show that around 14,730 women aged 18 and 34 were overwhelmed by their debts last year, compared with around 10,950 men.
