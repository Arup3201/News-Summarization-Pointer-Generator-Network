While she may never swap Buckingham Palace for the Bullring, a genealogy expert has claimed that the Duchess of Cambridge has clear links with Birmingham.

Australian history teacher Michael Reed discovered her ties to two of the city's blue-chip families - the Chamberlains and the Martineaus - as he examined her lineage.

The Chamberlain clan spawned visionary city leader Joseph and his son Neville, Prime Minister at the outbreak of the Second World War. They are remembered in the city centre square dedicated to Joseph Chamberlain.

Kate the Brummie? History teacher Michael Reed believes that the Duchess of Cambridge has ties to two of Birmingham's blue-chip families - the Chamberlains and the Martineaus

The Martineaus were another political dynasty whose numbers included five successive generations of mayors or lord mayors of Birmingham.

Mr Reed, of Hallam College, Melbourne, has been investigating Kate's roots since she married Prince William in 2011.

He is set to present his research at a conference at Birmingham's Newman University on July 4 and 5 to mark the centenary of Joseph Chamberlain's death.

Her hometown? Kate has been linked to the Chamberlain clan, who are remembered in the city centre square dedicated to Joseph Chamberlain, as well as the Martineau family

He said: 
'Kate's great great grandfather was Francis Martineau Lupton, a 
politician himself, and his first cousin was Birmingham Mayor Sir Thomas
 Martineau, a friend of Queen Victoria.

'Sir Thomas's nephew was Neville Chamberlain.'

As Hitler discovered when he met Neville in 1938, Kate's political relatives were strongly anti-war - hence his policy of appeasement.

'Sadly Francis Martineau Lupton's son, Lionel Martineau, was one of many in Kate's family killed in the First World War.'

 conference, co-organised with Birmingham Council and political history 
groups, includes a dinner at the Chamberlain family's Highbury Hall home
 in Moseley. 

It was also recently revealed that Maleficent actress Elle 
Fanning and her sister Dakota have been discovered to have royal blood, 
and are even distant cousins of the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton.

An
 ancestry website claims that the pair of movie star sisters are in fact
 'long lost princesses' who are related to King Edward III.

The sisters, who were born in Georgia, are also reported to share common ancestors with the Duchess of Cambridge.

If
 the researchers are correct then King Edward I aka Longshanks - the 
grandfather of King Edward III - is an ancestral link between Middleton 
and the Fannings.

And
 in another family connection, Middleton's mother Carole is many times great granddaughter of Edward III giving Elle and Dakota a strong blood 
tie to the brunette Royal.

THE CHAMBERLAINS

Joseph Chamberlain moved to Birmingham at the age of 18 to work at his uncle’s screw factory. He later became mayor of the city in 1873 after six years working in council.

He was known for his reform of Birmingham, campaigning for better public services and his work paid off – by 1890 Birmingham had become known as The Best Governed City in the World.

His son Neville Chamberlain also went on to be a political success. He was a British Conservative politician and served as Prime Minister for three years from 1937-1940. Neville Chamberlain famously saw Britain through the first eight months of World War Two after Adolf Hitler invaded Poland and Britain declared war, with Neville pledging to defend Poland.

Once Winston Churchill took his place in 1940, he remained an important member of Churchill’s war cabinet before his health deteriorated and he was forced to resign.

THE MARTINEAUS

Dr James Martineau was a professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy at Manchester New College. His portrait now hangs in The National Portrait Gallery. The Duchess of Cambridge is now Patron to the gallery.

The Martineau family also saw five successive generations of Lord Mayors of Birmingham, all father to son. A blue plaque was erected inside the Council House in 2008, listing the five Mayors:

Robert Martineau (1798 - 1870)

Mayor of Birmingham 1846 - 1847

Sir Thomas Martineau (1828 - 1893)

Mayor of Birmingham 1884 - 1887

Ernest Martineau (1861 - 1952)

Lord Mayor of Birmingham 1912 - 1914

Sir Wilfrid Martineau (1990 - 1964)

Lord Mayor of Birmingham 1940 - 1941
