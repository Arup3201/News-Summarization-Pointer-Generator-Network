Sitting around, chewing on the odd bit of bamboo - it's no wonder pandas need a nap now and then.

And when their hectic schedule gets too much, well, they fall asleep right where they are.

In the case of these exhausted pandas, that means perched precariously in a tree.

These adorable photographs show the giant pandas fast asleep amongst the branches of trees in the Panda Valley park in Dujiangyan, southwest China's Sichuan province.

How they managed not to fall out is perhaps a secret known only to pandas, but there's no doubt they looks pretty relaxed as they catch up on their sleep.

Giant pandas live in temperate-zone bamboo forests in central China, in mountain ranges in China's Sichuan, Saanxi, and Ganshu regions. Their thick black and white fur coat keeps them warm in the cool forests.

One of the rarest animals in the world - there are only around 1,000 left in the wild and 140 in zoos and breeding centres - they have come to symbolize animal conservation efforts.

Their diet is 99 per cent bamboo, but they also eat grasses, small rodents or even musk deer fawns.Â  They have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles to crush the bamboo.

While they look like large teddy bears, they are considered as dangerous as any other bear.

Just dropped off: These pandas look shattered as they catch up on some sleep perched high up in the forest

Out for the count: This sleeping giant panda couldn't look more comfortable if he were in a feather bed
