Accused; John Harold McGill, principal at Mt. Carmel Elementary School in Douglas County, attempted to have sex with a minor, according to the GBI

A Georgia elementary school teacher has been arrested and charged with trying to have sex with a child after a sting operation conducted online by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s Child Exploitation and Computer Crimes Unit.

John McGill, who is married with six children and three grandchildren, was one of 14 people taken into custody on Sunday in Operation Broken Heart and accused of traveling to meet a child for sex after visiting an internet chat room.

McGill, who is the principal of Mt. Carmel Elementary School in Douglas County denied the charges after he was booked under the Computer Pornography and Child Exploitation Prevention Act of 1999.

'The purpose of ‘Operation Broken Heart’ was to arrest persons who communicate with children on-line and then travel to meet them for the purpose of having sex,' the GBI said.

'On-line child predators visit chat rooms and websites on the internet, find children, begin conversations with them, introduce sexual content and arrange a meeting with the children for the purpose for having sex.'

However, the GBI have not made it clear whether McGill was talking to and traveling to meet an actual child or whether agents were posing as underage children.
