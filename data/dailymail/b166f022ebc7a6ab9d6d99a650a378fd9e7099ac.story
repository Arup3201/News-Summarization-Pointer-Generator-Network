Nigel Farage today said immigrants suffering from ‘life-threatening diseases’ should not be allowed into Britain.

The Ukip leader defended his call for foreigners suffering from HIV to be banned from moving to the UK – and said he would stop ‘people with tuberculosis too’.

Douglas Carswell, the party’s first MP, was left struggling to defend the remarks today after using his victory speech late last night to urge his party to speak with ‘compassion’.

Mr Carswell’s highly respected father Wilson Carswell also diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV/AIDS in Uganda and inspired the character Dr Garrigan in Giles Foden's novel The Last King of Scotland.

Douglas Carswell urged Ukip to show 'compassion' - just hours before Nigel Farage was forced to defend remarks calling for all immigrants with 'life threatening diseases' to be blocked from coming to the UK

Ukip's new MP Douglas Carswell faced a barrage of questions over Nigel Farage's remarks about HIV

Mr Carswell was born and grew up in Africa where both his parents worked as doctors.

On a walkabout in Clacton today, Mr Carswell said: ‘I agree with everything that Nigel has said and we need an Australian type immigration system.’

HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the UKIP leader's remarks displayed a ‘new level of ignorance’.

‘The idea that having HIV should be used as a black mark against someone's name is ridiculous and shows an outrageous lack of understanding of the issue,’ the charity's chief executive Rosemary Gillespie said.

She added: ‘In bracketing those living with the condition with murderers, and suggesting there is no place for them in his vision of Britain, Mr Farage has stooped to a new level of ignorance. He should be truly ashamed.’

But Mr Farage defended the remarks, originally published in the magazine Newsweek Europe.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK's public services could not cope with extra demand created by people with severe medical conditions coming to Britain.

He said: ‘We want people to come who have got trades and skills, but we don't want people who have got criminal records - and we can't afford people with life-threatening diseases.

‘I do not think people with life-threatening diseases should be treated by our National Health Service and that is an absolute essential condition for working out a proper immigration policy.

‘We have leading cancer experts in Britain saying the burden now of treating overseas people is leading to huge shortages in the system.’

He added the UK should follow similar bans he said were in place in the United States and Australia.

About 40 per cent of new HIV diagnoses in 2013 were of people born outside the UK, according to Public Health England.

Tory defector and UKIP candidate for the parliamentary seat of Rochester and Strood, Mark Reckless, said he did not believe there should be a blanket ban on people with HIV entering the country.

He added he believed the Mr Farage's comments, as reported by Newsweek Europe, were misleading.

A patient from overseas suffering from HIV is entitled to lifelong treatment on the NHS.

Thanks to a change in policy, an HIV-positive migrant could go and see their GP complaining of something as innocuous as a cold – and end up costing the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds.

This is because in a bid to prevent the spread of the disease, the Coalition in 2012 decided to treat all foreigners with HIV, even if their cases were not emergencies.

The NHS now offers expensive £20,000-a-year antiretroviral drugs to all non-British residents in England with the disease, including failed asylum seekers and students on temporary visas. 

The average lifetime treatment cost for an HIV-positive person runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds.

And once here, if a migrant or asylum seeker has HIV or Aids, it is hard to remove them. 

This is because failed asylum seekers from countries with poor medical systems can claim that sending them back would condemn them to die and so fight removal on the grounds that it would be a breach of their human rights. 

It is not known how many patients are affected or how much the policy has cost the Health Service in total. 

But doctors have warned that the cost to the NHS of ‘health tourism’ could be billions of pounds.

In his interview with Newsweek Europe Mr Farage is quoted as saying immigrants from outside Europe are ‘discriminated against because we have an open door into Europe today’.

Mr Farage added: ‘If you're an Indian engineer, say, your chances of admission are limited. UKIP want to control the quantity and quality of people who come.’

The UKIP leader then went on to define what he meant by ‘quality’.

‘It's simple. That Latvian convicted murderer shouldn't have been allowed here. Yes and people who do not have HIV, to be frank. That's a good start. And people with a skill.’

‘What are those words inscribed under the Statue of Liberty? 'Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses . . . ' What you're saying is: 'Bring me your electricians, your merchant bankers and your guys without HIV'.’

‘There are 190 countries in the world,’ Mr Farage added, ‘that operate like that’.

A caller to Mr Farage’s phone-in show on LBC called Charlie told Mr Farage that he was ‘ramping up the fear makes people hide’ and accuses him of ‘playing the race card’.

She said she was not a ‘drain on the health service’ just because she has HIV.

But Mr Farage said: ‘If we turn the national health service, and the clue is in the name, if we change it to the global health service, we are going to have a serious problem with resources.’ 

In the interview with Newsweek Europe, published today, Mr Farage said it was wrong that the ‘chances of admission’ of highly qualified engineers from India were limited.

‘Ukip want to control the quantity and quality of people who come,’ he said. 

Referring to convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns, who is suspected of murdering London schoolgirl Alice Gross, he added: ‘It’s simple. That Latvian convicted murderer shouldn’t have been allowed here.’

Asked whether ‘quality’ meant people without a homicide conviction, he answered: ‘Yes. And people who do not have HIV, to be frank. That’s a good start. And people with a skill. That is what Britain should do.’ 

He went on to say: ‘I have never said that we should not take refugees. We have a proud record of accepting refugees, and that must be continued.’

Nearly 20 Tories backed an unsuccessful amendment to the Government’s Immigration Bill earlier this year – which would have required anyone coming to settle in Britain to prove that they were not HIV positive or carrying Hepatitis B.

In 2010, Barack Obama overturned a 20-year-old US travel and immigration ban against people with HIV.

Currently around 60 countries bar the entry of HIV-positive people, according to the United Nations.

The list includes the Bahamas, the Kingdom of Brunei, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen.
