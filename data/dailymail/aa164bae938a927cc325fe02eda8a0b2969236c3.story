Lichfield MP Michael Fabricant,64, is the MP for the strait-laced Staffordshire cathedral city of Lichfield

There are colourful MPs. And there’s Michael Fabricant. His Commons office, preposterously modelled on the White House Oval Office, is a riot of red, white and blue giant Union Flags, Stars And Stripes banners. There is a ukulele on his desk.

His hair is an ‘enhanced’ yellow, straw like thatch. He is wearing pink and blue socks.

Even they pale into insignificance when he opens his mouth. He no sooner has a Technicolor thought than he blurts it out, or tweets it.

It got him sacked as Tory vice chairman earlier this year when, bizarrely, he tweeted about having sex with a llama and disowned a Conservative Minister in an expenses scandal and the HS2 rail link. Simultaneously.

Fabricant’s latest battle is with John Bercow who tried to ban him from a gay rights reception at the Speaker’s official residence a few weeks ago – only to be shamed into backing down by a Fab tweet.

Fabricant saw it as a lame attempt by Bercow to repay him for exposing how the Speaker told a senior Commons official to ‘f*** off’.

‘One minute it was “you appalling little s***, don’t ever darken our door”, next it was “what we meant is, of course you’re welcome”.’

So perhaps I should not be surprised to be sitting in his Commons office as the exotic MP for the strait-laced Staffordshire cathedral city of Lichfield:

Openly discusses intimate details of his sex life and his relationship with soulmate Andy Street, boss of John Lewis.

Reveals how ‘xenophobic and homophobic’ fellow Tory MPs made him want to vote for Tony Blair.

Jokes about his ‘bromance’ with Michael Gove and the ‘Heinrich Himmler’ antics of Tory chairman Grant Shapps.

Fabricant had cause to be annoyed by Bercow’s attempt to exclude him from the reception for Pink News. The gay rights website wanted to thank Fabricant for calling for curbs on gay blood donors to be scrapped.

The MP puts it as only he can: ‘If you are a straight guy screwing three girls a night and never use a condom, you can give blood. But if you are a gay bloke in a monogamous relationship having safe sex, unless you sign an affidavit that you have been celibate for 12 months, you can’t.

‘I mean, come on!’ he guffaws. ‘Most gay people I know can barely be celibate for 12 hours.’ It is not always easy to tell Fabricant’s campaigns and quips apart.

But there is no mistaking his loathing of Bercow – ‘petty and volatile, needs an anger management course’.

Beneath his flamboyance and Twitterings, being the Jewish son of a Second World War intelligence officer who became a rabbi after learning of the Holocaust left its mark.

Hear him scoff at the way he was fired by Shapps earlier this year: ‘He was only obeying orders, as Himmler would have said.’

Hitler’s henchman Heinrich Himmler ran the death camps that traumatised Fabricant’s father – though the jibe is clumsy, to say the least, bearing in mind Shapps is also from a Jewish family.

Fabricant clammed up when asked about his hair, other than to admit that it was 'enhanced'

On a slightly lesser scale, on entering politics in 1992 after making a pile selling equipment to foreign radio stations, Fabricant junior was shocked by the ‘xenophobic, misogynistic and homophobic’ Tory benches. Imitating a pukkah colonel’s voice, he recalls in disgust a debate on ending the ban on gays in the Armed Forces in which a fellow Conservative MP warned: ’We’ll have soldiers in pink feather boas proposing to each other.’

‘If I hadn’t been a Tory MP in the 1997 Election, I would probably have voted for Tony Blair,’ he says.

New Labour tried to tempt Fabricant to defect but he refused, saying, to derision from most, that he would wait until a ‘New Tory’ party came round to his ‘liberal’ views on gays, ethnic minorities and women’s rights. Eventually it did.

Many at Westminster deride him as more twit than Twitter.

But there was nothing silly about being among the first Tories to warn David Cameron of the ‘foolishness’ of dismissing Ukip as ‘fruitcakes, closet racists andloonies’.

Or about his recent behind-the-scenes intervention to stop young Commons interns being preyed on.

Fabricant, a preternaturally boyish 64, has never married, and shares a remote £300,000 Snowdonia holiday home with his very close friend of nearly 25 years, Andy Street, chief executive of John Lewis.

Fabricant met Street, 13 years his junior, when Street heckled him during a speech at Oxford University. A mutual love of walking turned into a different type of John Lewis partnership – though Fabricant has been criticised for using his position as an MP to defend Street’s Middle England shopping empire.

He loyally leapt to his defence on Twitter last month when the Street was forced to apologise for calling France ‘sclerotic, downbeat and hopeless.’

Are they an item?

‘No,’ laughs Fabricant. ‘Frankly, if we lived together we would murder each other!’ He reflects sincerely: ‘I have gone past the stage of wanting girlfriends and all the rest of it. I guess he’s someone I can rely on in life and he can rely on me.’

Before meeting Street, Fabricant had relationships with women, including an American girl who came back to the UK with him after he met her studying in California.

But he has no regrets at not marrying. ‘I have always run away from responsibilities like babies and things. It’s rather selfish actually. In my 30s I was abroad a lot – and I enjoy the company of blokes. I’m not exclusively gay [though] I have certainly done things with a bloke.’

The unconventional and almost alarmingly candid Mr Fabricant states he has only had full sexual intercourse with women, not men, though the explicit terms he uses to describe it would make readers of Pink News blush, never mind The Mail on Sunday’s.

He and Mr Street are content to have a relationship that does not involve such intimacy, he says.

Fabricant, pictured in the House of Commons, revealed that he is having a 'bromance' with Michael Gove

‘We can be friends without having him do things to my ****** or me to his, for God’s sake!’ he roars with metrosexual abandon.

However, he is keen to point out he does have an active sex life.

‘I get it in one form or another quite regularly, I can tell you,’ he chuckles. ‘All my bits and pieces work… They haven’t fallen off through lack of use.’

But not with Mr Street.

‘I give Andy a hug occasionally and he stands there rigid with embarrassment,’ he laughs.

Most people are not exclusively gay or straight, elaborates Mr Fabricant, but are ‘on a form of the [bisexual] spectrum, though whether they do anything about it is another matter.’

Unsurprisingly, his Cabinet favourites include fellow Tory free spirit and moderniser Michael Gove. ‘I’m having a bromance with Michael,’ he grins.

Less predictably, another is close friend and bluff Derbyshire ex-miner Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, the least likely Tory Cabinet Minister to read Pink News.

There is only one subject that makes Mr Fabricant clam up – his ludicrous barnet.

More like flax than real hair, and a lurid yellow from a child’s paint box, MPs swear it is a wig. A telltale 2in gap appears between the stiff tufts on his collar and the nape of his neck when he leans forward.

‘It’s not as simple as that,’ he replies coyly.

All he will say is that it is ‘enhanced’. Implants? Wig? Dyed?

Bald silence. It is one area where he is not coming out.

For all the Notting Hill modernity of today’s Conservatives, some traditionalists will share the view of Tory grandee Sir Anthony Royle, who interviewed young tyro Fabricant in the late 1970s.

‘You’d make a marvellous MP,’ he declaimed, somewhat to Fabricant’s surprise. ‘Have you tried the Liberal Party?’

Fabricant was sacked as Tory vice chairman earlier this year
