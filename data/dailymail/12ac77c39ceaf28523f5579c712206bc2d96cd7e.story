A football fan accused of making racist monkey gestures apparently towards a black player duringÂ  Chelsea's match against Manchester United has been arrested.

Gavin Kirkham, 28, is accused of making the gestures at Stamford Bridge during Wednesday night's game, yards from England striker Danny Welbeck.

He was arrested today after attending a West London police station by appointment.

He is being held on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence.

Before his arrest, Kirkham denied being a racist and said he was 'just one of the boys'.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 
'Officers investigating a complaint regarding alleged racist behaviour 
at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday have arrested a man.

'The 28-year-old man was arrested this afternoon, Monday, after attending a west London police station by appointment.

'He was arrested on suspicion of a 
racially aggravated Section 4A Public Order Act offence and currently 
remains in custody at the west London police station. Enquires continue.'

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is 
reported to have said before the arrest that he does not want Kirkham back in the stadium if 
the allegations prove to be true.

Football fans have branded Kirkham 
'an idiot' after he made the 
alleged 'monkey' gesture while sitting in the front row during the game with Manchester United.

Kirkham lists his pastimes on Facebook as Chelsea, playing football and drinking, the paper reported.

Chelsea Football Club said that they 
would 'take the strongest possible action, 
including supporting criminal prosecution' against the culprit following
this latest incident while supporting police in their investigation.
