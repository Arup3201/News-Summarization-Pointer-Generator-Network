Police are appealing for information after a six-year-old girl and her teenage aunt went missing.

Zeenat Abdala, 16, and her niece Lutfiya Salum were last seen at around midday yesterday as they left their home in Croydon, South London, to go to the library.

The youngsters came to the UK from 
Somalia earlier this year as unaccompanied minors and live in foster 
care, Scotland Yard said.

Missing: Zeenat Abdala, 16 (left) and her niece Lutfiya Salum were last seen at around midday yesterday

Police were alerted when the pair did not return to their home and it is understood they did not arrive at the library.

It is believed that they may be travelling to meet family that recently arrived in the UK.

Officers are concerned for their safety and welfare and have urged the girls to contact police or their foster carers as soon as possible.

Zeenat is described as a light skinned black girl with a slim face and slim build, 5ft 1in tall with black hair always in a headscarf. She is also described as looking younger than her age.

She was last seen wearing a plain brown silk headscarf, a three quarter length chocolate brown coat hooded with brown fur on the hood, underneath a brown cardigan with a fruit pattern and a long red/black and yellow dress with black leggings.

Planned destination: The pair were said to be on their way to the library on Lawrence Lane in the south London borough

She was wearing pink sandals and carrying a brown shoulder bag.

Lutfiya is also described as a light skinned black girl with round face and black hair in a bun.

She was last seen wearing a pink blouse, pink leggings, pink socks, black shoes, a grey cardigan and a three quarter length brown hooded coat.

It is believed Zeenat has access to money, a mobile phone and regularly uses the transport network.
