Hollywood star Harold Ramis has died aged 69 after a long illness.

Ramis was one of Tinseltown's most successful filmmakers in the 1980’s and 90’s – starring in 'Ghostbusters' and writing credits on classics such as ‘Animal House,’ ‘Caddyshack,’ ‘National Lampoon’s Vacation,’ ‘Stripes,’ ‘Groundhog Day’ and ‘Analyze This.’

The Chicago native died from complications of autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis – which swells the blood vessels - surrounded by family just before 1.00am, his wife Erica told the Chicago Tribune.

Loss of a legend: Harold Ramis wrote and directed 'Caddyshack' and 'Stripes,' and had writing credits in 'Meatballs' and 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' to name a few

Ramis’ health began going downhill in 2010 when complications of the autoimmune disease arose from an infection. The condition was so severe he had to learn how to walk all over again, a family spokesperson told the paper.

He never fully recovered, and finally lost his battle with the disease.

Tributes began pouring in from all around Hollywood as the industry reeled from his death.

'Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my brilliant, gifted, funny friend, co-writer/performer and teacher Harold Ramis. May he now get the answers he was always seeking,' Dan Akroyd said.

'Sad to hear my friend Harold Ramis passed away. A brilliant, funny, actor and director. A wonderful husband and dad. Big loss to us all,' tweeted Billy Crystal.

'Was honored to have gotten to work 
with Harold Ramis, the Buddha of Comedy. Brilliant, humble, radiant. 
We've lost an icon,' tweeted Rainn Wilson.

Ramis recently directed several episodes of NBC's 'The Office,' Wilson co-starred in the show as the neurotic Dwight Schrute.

'Harold Ramis. Funny, gracious, kind hearted. A joy to have known you,' tweeted 'Office' star Steve Carell.

The beloved filmmaker was known for his over the top comedies with an uncommon touch.

His
 off-beat, but cerebral and self-aware characters brought tears of 
laughter and sadness to millions. His movies are the soundtrack to many 
childhoods that eventually grew into happy hours.

Ramis'
 first major film was the raucous 1978 John Belushi comedy 'Animal 
House,' which made the latter a household name and still inspires jokes 
among college students decades later.

Belushi was one of three future Hollywood stars Ramis worked with in the 1970's at Second City - Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd were also lighting rooms up with their humor as Ramis played the willing straight man.

'I stopped being the zany... I learned that my thing was lobbing in great lines here and there, which would score big and keep me there on the stage,' Ramis told the Tribune years ago.

That theme continued for the rest of his acting career, as he spent it either writing the punchlines for others, directing or playing the straight man.

His first acting role came in 'Stripes,' a movie he wrote for Murray. But he shot to stardom starring as the geeky, science-obsessed Dr. Egon Spengler in both 'Ghostbusters' movies.

Ramis never had more than bit parts after his run as Spengler was through, but his film writing legacy spans generations.

'Harold Ramis was a brilliant, shining example for every comedy writer hoping to achieve excellence the field.  He will be sorely missed,' Seth MacFarlane tweeted.

'If
 you're my age and got into comedy, Harold Ramis was one of the reasons.
 Life is fast and over too soon,' tweeted Zach Braff.

Stars of his movies also shared their grief.

'Very, very sad to hear that Harold Ramis has died. He was a lovely man and I loved working with him. RIP,' tweeted Eliazbeth Hurley, she starred in the Ramis-written 2000 film 'Bedazzled.'

'No no not Harold Ramis. Worked for him years ago. He was the real deal. Growing up, his work changed my life. He will be missed,' tweeted John Favreau.

He wrote and directed 1980's 'Caddyshack,' cementing both he and Mrray's place in Hollywood. They would make several more films together.

'In 1993 Harold Ramis called me & told me his 2 rules of directing comedy: '1. Hire Bill Murray 2. Turn on camera,' filmmaker Dan Mirvish tweeted upon hearing of Ramis' death.

Ramis' seemingly struck gold with every film script he churned out, from 'Meatballs' to 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' which launched a string of sequels and Chevy Chase's film career.

The parade of hits continued with 'Caddyshack 2,' the critically acclaimed 'Groundhog Day,' 'Analyze This' and sequel 'Analyze That.'

His last acting role came as the 
father to Seth Rogen's character in 2009's 'Knocked Up.' Rogen has often
 said Ramis is one of the reasons he began doing comedy.

'His
 work is the reason why so many of us got into comedy,' 'Knocked Up' 
director Judd Apatow told the Tribune. 'We grew up on 'Second City TV' 
and 'Ghostbusters,' 'Vacation,' 'Animal House,' 'Stripes,' 'Meatballs,' 
he literally made every single one of our favorite movies.'

How many will always remember him: Ramis as Dr Spengler on the set of 'Ghostbusters'

Millions of people who have never met Ramis are also saddened by the loss of the iconic filmmaker.

'It's always so strange when someone you watched and loved and who influenced you so much when you were a kid passes away. RIP Harold Ramis,' tweeted Mitch Silpa.

'I'm actually for-real crying about Harold Ramis. My god, when the next Ghostbuster goes, I'm going to need a day off work to recover,' tweeted astronaut Heather Archuleta.

The success and acclaim never changed him though, Second City founder Bernie Sahlens told the Tribune before his death. Sahlens had known him since 1969.

'He's the least changed by success of anyone I know in terms of sense of humor, of humility, sense of self,' said his former mentor. 'He's had enormous success relatively, but none of it has gone to his head in any way.'

That human touch is why millions flocked to his movies, stars lined up to act in his films and why many will likely wake up in the morning wishing Monday was Groundhog Day.
