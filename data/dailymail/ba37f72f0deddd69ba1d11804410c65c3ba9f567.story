Facebook crashed yesterday afternoon, less than 24 hours after its $5billion IPO which will make millionaires out of 1,000 of its employees.

The site was inaccessible for several minutes - forcing users to take to the social network's rival to bemoan the ill-timed outage.

Facebook’s explosive growth is set to value the company at a whopping $100billion in the wake of the biggest stock offering in Silicon Valley's history.

Thanks: Facebook released a picture of some staff thanking users for their support ahead of its $5billion initial public offering. But some users don't think that is enough thanks and they want a cut of the money

But the social network in Menlo Park, California, is now facing
a backlash from some of its 845million users, some of whom are unhappy that so much money is being made from
the information and photos they posted for free.

And they won't see a cent of it.

Along with that criticism, the relatively care-free days of ‘hypergrowth’ may be behind
Facebook, as the firm begins the difficult task of living up to Wall Street's
lofty expectations under the new, public microscope, analysts say.

At a valuation of $100billion, Facebook is worth $118 per
user. Last month, 57 per cent of active users interacted with the service on
any given day, up from 54 per cent at the same time last year.

And despite some backlash, U.S. users seem willing to devote increasing amounts of time
to the site - seven hours each month compared to just over five hours only a
year ago, data from industry research firm comScore says.

Facebook released a picture of its staff on Wednesday thanking
its users for their support ahead of its $5billion initial public offering. They also seemed to be thanking users for making them rich.

Head guy: Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, seen in San Francisco, California. The social network filed an initial public offering prospectus on Wednesday with an eye toward raising $5billion

User Phillip Pambrun doesn’t think they went far enough showing their appreciation.

‘Am I the only person that thinks every Facebook member
should receive at least one share at initial post?’ Mr Pambrun wrote. He went
on to suggest users complain to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, 27.

'If it wasn't for all of you loyal and faithful Facebookers, this would never have gotten this far. So, everyone, message the high "Z" for your minimum one share'

‘If it wasn't for all of you loyal and faithful Facebookers,
this would never have gotten this far,’ he wrote, reported CNN. ‘So, everyone,
message the high "Z" for your minimum one share.’

And there may be bigger riches to come for the company and the thousands of employees who hold equity in the company.

Facebook's advertising business has room for growth. In
2011, the number of ads delivered on the website rose 42 per cent year on year,
while the average price per ad delivered rose 18 per cent.

The wealth of information that users give Facebook - from
their age, gender and city of residence to the music and products that they ‘like’
- means that the company can easily do targeted marketing.

Jeff Pantridge joked that he was considering making a ‘Jeffbook’
website. ‘I should have something whipped up in an hour,’ the user wrote, reported CNN. ‘Friend
me, follow me... Whatever ... . It's time to get paid.’

But the $3.7billion in revenue last year was at the low end
of expectations and showed the wide gulf between its current business and the
most optimistic hopes that many investors have.

'$5 billion IPO for Facebook?!?!? What the hell am I doing on Facebook??? Screw this... I'm making Jeffbook. I should have something whipped up in an hour. Friend me, follow me... Whatever ... . It's time to get paid'

Jeff Pantridge, user

‘For the valuation that people are going to be paying for
this name, they're going to probably be overpaying by a third because of the
optimism related to just the name,’ Michael Yoshikami said.

Mr Yoshikami, the chief executive of California-based wealth
management firm YCMNET Advisors, added: ‘The numbers justify maybe a $50billion (valuation) number.’

Facebook's revenue growth rate - roughly 88 per cent in 2011
- would justify a $65billion valuation, which is far short of the $100billion
that sources have said the company is looking for, he said.

No doubt some disgruntled users would take their share of that lower valuation figure.

Big job: The relatively care-free days of 'hypergrowth' may be behind Facebook, as the firm begins the difficult task of living up to Wall Street's lofty expectations under a public microscope, analysts say

Meanwhile, membership growth is slowing. In the last three
months of 2011, Facebook's total monthly active users rose 5.6 per cent versus
10.5 per cent in the last three months of 2010.

‘The hypergrowth is probably over,’ economic analyst Michael
Pachter said. ‘The low-hanging fruit of the Western developed world has already
been penetrated to a large extent.’

Facebook knows it needs to diversify revenue streams. It has
a successful gaming business that nets it 30 per cent of the revenue from sales
of virtual goods in games like Zynga’s Farmville.

But it wants to encourage users to stay for media content, competing
against Apple and Google. It has rolled out a steady stream of new features and
capabilities, from video chat to mobile apps.

‘There's probably going to be a breaking point in how many
of these new technologies consumers can cobble into their lives,’ analyst Rebecca
Lieb said. ‘You still have to eat, you still have to sleep.’
