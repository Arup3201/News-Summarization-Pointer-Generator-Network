Yes, miss: Bernice McCabe said that failing to stretch students does ‘no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds’ in particular

Schools that attempt to make learning ‘relevant’ or ‘accessible’ rather than concentrating on ‘challenge and rigour’ are just patronising pupils, a leading head teacher will warn today.

Bernice McCabe, an adviser to Prince Charles, said that failing to stretch students does ‘no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds’ in particular.

This is because youngsters are deprived of ‘potentially powerful knowledge’, which helps them get ahead in life.

Mrs McCabe, headmistress of the North London Collegiate School – the top independent for GCSE results last year – is addressing head teachers at a conference at The Prince’s Teaching Institute, a charity that helps teachers rediscover their passion for subjects.

She will point out that at the institute’s first leadership conference in 2011, everyone agreed the best way to attain achievement is to ‘ensure that high quality education is there for everyone.’

She will add: ‘Because if challenge and rigour in teaching and learning are not there for all, not only is it harder for universities and employers to find applicants with the required levels of knowledge and skills, but we do no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds by depriving them of potentially powerful knowledge – quite the opposite of government intentions. 

‘To provide young people just with what is regarded as "relevant" or "accessible" is patronising and presumes to place a limit on their capacity for learning. It does nothing to enhance life prospects.

‘The purpose of their education must surely be to open our pupils’ eyes to new horizons.’

Teachers are not ‘ill equipped’ to do this.

But attempts are being hampered by governments that focus on ‘short-term results and favourable headlines about rising standards’.

She says: ‘Britain has a strong tradition of liberal education that encourages independent thought, intellectual curiosity and cultural enrichment.

‘These values are in the DNA of the British education system and we should not be shy about celebrating them.

‘The trouble is that we have educational policies dictated by governments who want short-term results and favourable headlines about rising standards.

‘While this may be understandable, given the huge investment of public money in our schools, it is also unreasonable in that the full effects of the education we provide may not be revealed until years later.

‘Only then can we see whether our former pupils have become effective and successful in their work, fulfilled in their personal lives, and are making an effective contribution to society.’

Mrs McCabe admits that the Coalition has given head teachers more freedom and a revised national curriculum.

She adds: ‘So there is currently plenty of encouragement, in theory at least, for heads to choose their own pathways and priorities, and to determine their own aims and objectives to suit the particular circumstances of their school.’

This was despite the fact it has ditched the ‘too easy’ English Literature GCSE, with students taking an AS-level in the subject instead.
