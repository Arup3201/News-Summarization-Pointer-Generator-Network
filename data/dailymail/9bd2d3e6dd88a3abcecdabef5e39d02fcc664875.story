Soldier Robert Spence will face trial accused of racism after taking part in Trooping the Colour

A serving soldier who denies calling a black man 'monkey boy' at a Chelsea match will stand trial accused of racism after taking part in Trooping the Colour.

Robert Spence, 31, is alleged to have directed the insult towards a man at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-0 pre-season win against Spanish side Real Sociedad last August.

Spence, who is based at Wellington Barracks in London, denied one count of racially-aggravated threatening, abusive words or behaviour at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court today.

The barracks is 300 yards from the palace and is home to the Foot Guards Battalions - the regular infantry regiments of the Household Division.

Spence was allegedly identified as participating in chanting, telling the victim to look up the song on YouTube and asking him if he was from Africa. 

The soldier, who has served overseas, attended the match with his girlfriend, a Colombian fine art student, who will give evidence in his defence at his trial.

The initial trial date of June 2 had to be scrapped because Spence will be preparing for Trooping the Colour.

The annual military event takes place on June 13 and marks the Queen's official birthday.

Spence was bailed unconditionally to return for trial on June 30.

Spence, who has served overseas, is based at Wellington Barracks near Buckingham Palace
