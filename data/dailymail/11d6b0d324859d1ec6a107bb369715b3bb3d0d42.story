Duped: Two couples say they were conned by the same woman who offered to give her 'unborn baby' up for adoption. They later realized she had never been pregnant to being with. Above, a pic of the woman and victim Kayla Hall 

Two couples have come forward to warn of a 36-year-old woman who is faking a pregnancy and promising to give her unborn child up for adoption.

Kevin and Becky Clark of Ohio and Jeff and Kayla Hall of South Carolina claim they were duped by the same woman who led them on for weeks in the adoption process before abruptly announcing that the child had died in stillbirth.

The con artist didn't ask either couple for money, so no charges has been filed against her and her identity remains concealed, the Columbus Post-Dispatch reports. 

The Clarks say the woman finds her victims on Facebook, where couples seeking to adopt have started setting up special pages to speed up the process.

The woman said she had mental health issues that prevented her from becoming a mom and that the father was a man who raped her after asking her out through a Christian dating service.

Looking back, the Clarks noticed some early signs that not all was right - like when she shied away form letting Becky listen to the baby with a stethoscope.

However, the hopeful couple took the woman on her word when she told them she was due in May and even gave them an ultrasound photo.

Then in late January, she called them to say that she had lost the baby in stillbirth.

Promises: Kevin and Becky Clark of Ohio say the woman offered to give her unborn son up for adoption, then said the baby died in stillbirth last January. They have since found another child to adopt, named Lilly 

Victims: Jeff and Kayla Hall were also duped by the woman, who even sent them a picture of the 'stillborn' baby girl she promised them. When they called the company who allegedly took the stillborn portrait, they said they had no record of the baby 

The Clarks became suspicious when she wouldn't allow them to visit her at the hospital, instead sending a picture of her ID bracelet and a graphic photo of a dead baby.

They agreed to meet with her one more time when they got dinner at a mall. They were completely put off though when she asked to go to Build-A-Bear to put a heart in a teddy bear for their lost child.

'For little kids, it’s a cute place,' Mr. Clark told the Post-Dispatch. 'For three adults? Just weird.'

Questions: The Clarks became suspicious of the woman when she would not let them visit her in the hospital after the alleged stillbirth 

The Halls were targeted in June when the woman messaged them on her adoption Facebook page, asking: 'Are you looking for a baby?'

'From that moment until we basically busted her, she and I were in contact every day,' Mrs Hall said.

Mrs Hall says she was overjoyed at the prospect of being able to adopt the woman's little 'girl'.

'Somebody is willing to do something for you that you can’t do for yourself,' she said. 'I was devoted to her.'

At the time, the woman said she was 30 weeks pregnant and that she had been abandoned by the baby's father and her own family.

Mrs Hall even invited the woman to visit them at their home in South Carolina. She became close to the family, Skyping with the Hall children and messaging them constantly.

Then, just a month later, she broke the news that the baby died in still birth.

She sent them a photo to prove it, saying it was from a professional organization that takes portraits for the parents of stillborn infants,

However, the Halls thought the baby just looked asleep. When they contacted the organization, they said they had no record of the request.

Expanding family: The Halls have chosen to keep their Facebook page up as they continue to look for another child to adopt. They previously adopted three boys

The Halls then called the woman out for the fake pregnancy and she continued to deny it before eventually revealing she has multiple personality disorder.

'I felt sick,' Mrs. Hall said. 'I realized I literally had a sociopath in my home.'

The Halls and Clarks eventually connected and decided to come forward with the story.

The Clarks have since found a baby girl to adopt, while the Halls are still looking, and sticking with Facbeook.

'We’re still using it,' Mrs. Hall said. 'I believe there are way more good people than bad.'
