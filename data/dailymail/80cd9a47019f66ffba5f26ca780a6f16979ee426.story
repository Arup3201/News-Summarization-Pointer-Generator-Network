Dozens of starlings have been found dead in the middle of a busy road in a bizarre incident which witnesses compared to The X-Files.  

Around 30 bird corpses appeared in the road outside Bolton on Sunday afternoon, prompting speculation as to the cause of the avian disaster.  

Locals reported hearing a loud bang shortly before the starlings were discovered, suggesting that they may have been hit by a truck while flying low over the road.  

Mass extinction: Dozens of starlings were found dead in the road outside Bolton this week 

Mystery: It is not known how the starlings were killed all at the same time on Sunday afternoon 

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said that the birds - which usually travel in a tight flock - might have flown into a vehicle after becoming dazzled or confused.  

It is also possible that they were caught in a trail of toxic air, but the RSPB said that was less likely.  

A spokesman for the charity said: 'I have heard of a previous discovery of a group of dead starlings, and it was never really established how they got there.  

'The most likely reason is that they confused and flew into something, or were dazzled. Or they may have been hit by a lorry at speed as they were cutting across the road. They do fly low enough for that.' 

Crash? One possibility is that the birds were hit by a lorry as they were flying low over the road

One spring day in 2010, dozens of starlings started falling out of the sky and into the garden of nurse Jackie Wright in Coxley, Somerset.

By the time she came home from work, there were 100 birds lying dead on the lawn after falling victim to a mystery ailment.   

Experts said that they had probably been startled by a bird of prey, prompting them to change direction suddenly.  

Craig Clarkson, who saw the birds shortly after the mass death, said he thought there could have been as many as 100 of them. 

'A guy told us he had heard a loud bang and then found these birds outside,' he added. 

'It was really weird, like something out of the X-Files.'  

Kayleigh Knott, who was visiting a friend in the area, said: 'I've heard of things like this happening elsewhere and they've never found an explanation.  

'This is just so unusual and people need to know why this has happened.'
