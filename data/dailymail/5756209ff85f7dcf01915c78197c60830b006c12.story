US spies were allowed to analyse the emails and phone records of potentially millions of Britons after being given permission by Tony Blair's Labour Government, it has been claimed.

The government allowed the US National Security Agency to store information regarding Briton's landline numbers and later data regarding mobile phone and email communications and internet use.

According to Channel 4 News, documents leaked by fugitive NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, show that the NSA was given the go ahead to 'unminimise' British landline telephone numbers from as early as 2004 in a 2007 agreement meaning that the agency was not required to delete the files and could analyse them.

Agreement: The US National Security Agency, whose Maryland headquarters are pictured, were allowed to analyse landline phone records from 2004, according to claims by Channel 4 News

New claims: While top secret US document said it would only spy with the permission of GCHQ (pictured), another draft memo said it would analyse communications 'unilaterally'

Documents from 2005 that were circulated to the UK's own intelligence service GCHQ outlines how America would target British citizens 'with the full knowledge and co-operation of GCHQ'.

The NSA said that it would monitor communications in the 'best interest of the US'.

But a second document, a draft memo marked 'Noforn' which means it is not for release even to British eyes, says how the NSA was prepared to spy on UK communications 'unilaterally' and without the British government's permission.

Deal: The alleged agreement with US intelligence services took place while Tony Blair was Prime Minister

The two documents contain different wording and contain different circulation lists.

Both the US and UK authorities have declined to comment on what happened to the draft memo.

According to Channel 4 News, it could be that if a UK citizen sent a circular email to a terror suspect and everyone else in his or her contacts book, then details of everyone on that list would be monitored.

The revelations appear to fly in the face of an agreement signed between the two countries in 1946 that the nations would share intelligence on foreign countries but not spy on each other.

That agreement was later expanded to include five English-speaking nations and became known as the 'five-eyes' agreement.

Margaret Beckett took over as Foreign Secretary in 2006 and still held the role a year later when the US and UK made the alleged agreement.

Jack Straw was her predecessor.

Channel 4 News attempted to contact both of them regarding the Snowden documents and both declined to comment.

It is unclear whether UK intelligence services received anything in return as part of the agreement.

MailOnline attempted to contact a spokesman for the Labour Party but is yet to receive any response.
