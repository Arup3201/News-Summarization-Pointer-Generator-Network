For a few months London's Shard was the tallest building  in Europe, putting every other construction in the shade.

But Moscow has now reclaimed bragging rights after officially unveiling a mixed office and residential tower called Mercury City.

The tower, sheathed in copper-colored glass, tops out at 338 metres (1,109ft), beating the 310m Shard by 92ft.

It actually became Europe's tallest in
September, while still under construction, according to the construction information 
company Empori.

But it's 
reign is likely to be almost as short. It's next door to the 
under-construction Federation Tower, which is to reach 506 meters (1,660
feet) when it's completed next year.

Both are in a sprawling development called Moscow City that also holds two other buildings that once were Europe's tallest.

The complex is an eye-catching demonstration of Moscow's transformation from drab shabbiness to swaggering prosperity, driven largely by oil and natural gas revenues.

Mercury City 'distinctly shows the activity of Russian business' according to  Igor Kesayev, director of the Mercury company,.

He told the news agency Interfax: 'It demonstrates that all of Russia is on a level with countries of the eurozone, continuing its planned development and moving forward.'

But competing with European countries for tallest building is playing in the minor leagues.

There are nearly 60 buildings in North America, Asia and the Middle East that are taller, topped by Dubai's Burj Khalifa - about 2.5 times taller than Mercury city at 828 meters (2,717 feet).
