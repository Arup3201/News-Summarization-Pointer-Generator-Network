A predicted rise in pests could cause vast bread and potato shortages and force the nation to change its diet, scientists claim.

According to a study, Britain’s farms could be ‘overwhelmed’ by pests within the next 30 years and the risk to crops has been ‘significantly underestimated’.

One in ten pest types are already present in half the world’s crop-producing countries. However this is set to increase dramatically as a result of climate change and inadequate biosecurity measures meant to protect species from disease.

And researchers at the University of Exeter say the UK is particularly vulnerable having ‘significantly underestimated’ the risk that crop pests pose to crops including wheat and potatoes.

The study forecasts that factors including climate change, inadequate biosecurity measures and other new variants will help pests spread in the next three decades.

Professor Sarah Gurr, of the University of Exeter and Rothamsted Research, said: ‘The UK has significantly underestimated the scale of the threat.

‘This is a huge problem that is lacking in public and political awareness.

‘People are absolutely paralysed with fear of diseases like Ebola, but while they are extremely dangerous, the need to tackle crop diseases is just as pressing.

‘We are not spending enough on research, on training, on surveillance and on biosecurity.

‘Unless we significantly step up our efforts we could be forced to change our diets in the future as crops come and go.’

Potential threats include fungi, bacteria, viruses and insects, with powdery mildew and leaf blotch posing a danger to wheat. 

Items like bread and potatoes are said to be at risk of pests in the UK after threat was 'underestimated'

Potatoes are at risk from new variants of Phytophthora infestans – the blight which caused the catastrophic Irish potato famine of the late 1840s.

Professor Gurr said that if pests go on to spread at their current rate, then a large proportion of the world’s biggest food-producing countries will be inundated with pests.

Dr Dan Bebber, of the University of Exeter, who also worked on the report, told the Independent this would pose a ‘grave threat to global food security’.

More than one in 10 pest types is already present in about half the crop-growing countries, but that level is set to increase dramatically, the report states.

A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘We take the issue of plant biosecurity very seriously and have appointed a chief plant health officer to oversee our work. 

'This includes a plant health risk register and biosecurity strategy for the UK.’
