Al-Qaeda has called for a new generation of 'lone wolf' terrorists to blow up American Airlines, United and Delta planes using bombs made in their kitchens.

The chilling call to arms in the terror group's magazine, Inspire, says the high-profile airlines should be targeted in a bid to gain headlines and 'crush the enemy's economy'.

Released on Christmas Eve, the disturbing publication names the four companies because of their size - including United, the 'world's largest airline with 86,852 employees'.

American Airlines, United, Continental and Delta are also named in the magazine - despite the fact that Continental Airlines stopped flying planes under its name two years ago after merging with United

Also targeted are Air France and British carriers British Airways and easyJet - alongside high-profile U.S. figures Bill Gates and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. 

Continental Airlines is also singled out despite the fact that it stopped flying planes under its name two years ago after merging with United to form United Continental Holdings.

The magazine praises Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called 'underpants bomber' who was jailed for life in 2012 after he tried to bomb a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. 

The 300 people on board were saved partly because the bomb sewn into his underwear failed to detonate fully, prosecutors said at the time. 

The latest edition has been published four years after the first issue of Inspire contained a notorious explosives guide called Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom. 

The guide was suspected to have been the template for explosives which killed three and injured more than 250 in last year's Boston Marathon bombings.

Targets: The sick magazine picks out British Airways and easyJet as targets for would-be terrorists

Journal: The magazine has been connected to the Boston Marathon bombings in April last year

Its author was dubbed the 'Al-Qaeda chef', and an extremist assuming the same name was interviewed in the latest issue as it claimed the Boston attacks were a 'natural reaction' to the 'arrogance' of the U.S.

He said the 'first priority' for any of his terrorists would be the U.S., 'then the United Kingdom, then France and so on.' 

And he called for the rise of the 'lone wolf' jidahist, saying: 'It is hard to uncover, because none knows him but Allah. He has no relationship with any group or any individuals.'

The magazine also praised an axe attack on a group of New York city policemen in October as a 'splendid' example of a 'lone wolf'.

U.S. Navy veteran Zale Thompson was shot dead in the street after the brutal hatchet attack, which the FBI confirmed last month it was considering as an act of terror. 

FBI director James Comey said Thompson had been watching Islamic State beheading videos and other radical jihadist material online, adding there is 'no doubt that played a role' in the attack.

'There is no doubt it was terrorism,' he added. 

Shock tactics: The magazine includes images of an airport departures board and, on its cover, a jumbo jet

Praised: The Boston bombings (left is suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev) and 'underpants bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (right) are both mentioned in the magazine, whose possession in the past has led to arrests 

The magazine is published by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and its possession by terror suspects has led to arrests in Britain.

Belonging to Al Qaeda has been banned since 2001, and the 2000 Terrorism Act made it illegal to possess any document which could help someone 'prepare an act of terrorism'.

Four men from Luton, Bedfordshire, were jailed for a combined 44 years in April 2013 after a court heard they had planned to follow instructions from  Inspire magazine to carry out an attack.

Other terrorists were convicted under section 58 of the act solely for possessing the magazine.

Those who are found guilty can be jailed for up to ten years.

A British Airways spokesman said: 'The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority. We continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.'

He added: 'We never comment on matters of security.'

An easyJet spokesman added: 'The safety and security of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority. We are unable to comment further on matters of security.'

A spokesman for Britain's Home Office said: 'We are aware of this publication and the police and security agencies are taking appropriate action. National security and protecting the public is our priority.

'Our comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy includes measures to remove terrorist material hosted online, prevent radicalisation and protect the UK from acts of terrorism.'
