The Duchess of Cornwall has revealed that she regularly cuddles up with her grandchildren to tell them bedtime stories - and also wants to encourage 17-month-old Prince George to read.

Launching a creative writing contest with Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans yesterday, Camilla recalled how her own passion for reading and writing was inspired by her late father.

He, said the Duchess, would perch on the end of her bed at night telling 'fabulous' tales that would leave her imagination reeling.

'I have a step-grandson called George and while he is too little to enter now, I hope one day he will,' she added.

'If you can read and tell stories you can sit in an empty room and take yourself into all sorts of exciting worlds. 

'It's something my father taught me and then I went on to read to my children and now grandchildren.

'Sadly I am at least 100 and far too old to enter, but I hope everyone who can will.'

While Prince George might be too young to enter a writing competition, he certainly isn't averse to books and was spotted clutching what looked like a copy of Curious George as he was driven into Buckingham Palace for the Queen's annual Christmas lunch in December.

Literacy: The Duchess supports several literacy initiatives and is a keen reader herself

Written by Hans Augusto and Margret Rey, the first book in the series, Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys, made its debut in France in 1939, although the central character was called Fifi instead.

When the book made its UK debut in 1941, the monkey, by then called George elsewhere, was rechristened Zozo to spare King George VI the embarrassment of sharing his name with an ape.

By the time the second book in the series, Curious George Takes A Job, was published in 1947, the monkey had his name back and Curious George has remained Curious George ever since.

The Duchess of Cornwall has herself has long been a supporter of children's literacy and has joined forced with Evans to encourage children under 13 to pen their own stories.

Other high profile supporters of the 500 Words competition include Horrid Henry creator Francesca Simon, who joined the Duchess at Weston Park Primary School in North London at for the contest's official launch today.

Camilla, who is recently returned from her Christmas break at Birkhall, toured several classrooms, sinking to her knees and chatting to children about their ideas.

In a brainstorming session, she was asked by Ms Simon to come with with an idea involving two random props - a shell and a kaleidoscope.

Camilla suggested a story about a shell washing up on a deserted treasure island, which led to the children excitedly pitching in with their own ideas.

'What wonderful stories,' she said. She also asked the Horrid Henry author: 'When I was at school about 100 years ago, I was taught to write a beginning, middle and end. Where do you start?'

She added: 'I just want to see as many children as possible get involved.'
