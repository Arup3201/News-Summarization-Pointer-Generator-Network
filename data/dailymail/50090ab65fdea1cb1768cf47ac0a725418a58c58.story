Arsenal are monitoring Hamburg midfielder Tolgay Arslan.

The club have sounded out his representatives and will be keeping tabs on the player, who is out of contract on June 30, 2015, and would be available for a free transfer next summer. The player is seeking wages of around £40,000 per week to make the move to north London.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is keen to bring in a defensive midfielder and Arslan would fit in with the Frenchman's style of play.

The 24-year-old is a hard-worker in front of the back four in the centre of midfield with a tidy, short passing game.

He started out as a striker and was then considered an attacking midfielder early on in his professional career, but has since developed the defensive side of his game and is seen more as a defensive midfielder.

Born in Germany to Turkish parents, he initially represented Turkey's Under 19 and 21 side but has more recently played for Germany's Under 20s and 21s.

Growing up, the player modelled his game on Zinedine Zidane and George Hagi. In 2010 he said: 'Since my childhood I admire a great deal Zinedine Zidane and George Hagi. I enjoy watching these two players.'
