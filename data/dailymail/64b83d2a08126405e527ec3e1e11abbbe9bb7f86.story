Every day, Belinda Modra, who works in marketing in Adelaide, would jokingly ask her boyfriend to tell her how much he loved her.

So when Nathan Humphris, 34, a plasterer, decided to propose to Ms Modra, 28, he answered her question in an over-the-top way â€“ by covering her car in hundreds of post-it notes on which he had written: 'I love you this much'.

Mr Humphris began the extravagant proposal by sending five bouquets of flowers, an hour apart, to Ms Modra's office, each one bearing a one-word note, which combined to read: 'I love you this much'.

I love you this much: Nathan Humphris wrote a message of love on 1,500 post-it notes and covered his girlfriend's car with them before proposing to her later that evening

'I thought, he's either done something really wrong I'm going to hear about it tonight, or there'll be something waiting for me at home,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

When she finished for the day, Ms Modra walked to find her car covered in post-it notes.

'I got back to my car and sort of spotted it from a distance and knew where I parked, but thought I definitely didn't leave it like that, I was a bit taken aback,' she said.

Mr Humphris had spent five hours writing 'I love you this much' on 1,500 post-it notes and, with the help of two friends, spent an hour covering her car with the message.

'We don't have a secret fetish for post-it notes,' Mr Humphris told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was just an over the top sort of thing.'

Ms Modra said she was touched by the extravagant gesture but 'then I thought: How am I going to drive home?'

Nathan Humphris said he never intended for his proposal to become public, but curious passersby took photos of the post-it-covered car and began an online search for the couple

When she arrived at the Adelaide home they share, Ms Modra found their front courtyard filled with 500 red and white balloons.

'There was a sea of balloons to my waist, so I had to swim through them,' she said.

Inside, she found tea candles arranged in a love heart, banners hanging through the house, her favourite chocolates and cocktails laid out for her, and instructions about where to find her boyfriend.

'Eventually I found him and he was standing there in his suit getting a bit emotional. He gave the big speech about how much he loves me, how it's taken us a while but we got there, then he got down on one knee proposed.'

Ms Modra accepted and the couple, who got together 10 years ago with a few breaks, are planning to get married in February or March next year.

The couple insist that they did not want a public proposal, but passersby were so intrigued by the post-it covered car that they took photos and an online campaign started to find out the story behind the car.

'I wasn't looking to do a huge display of affection,' said Mr Humphris. 'In fact we only post-it-noted the window at 3.30 and she got to the car at 5.30, so it was only two hours, but people took photos.'

Mr Humphris had intended to propose while the couple were on holiday at a luxury resort in Thailand, but decided against it, saying: 'I knew Belinda would prefer something a bit more personal, because if I put more effort in, I thought that would mean more to her than just spending a lot of money.'
