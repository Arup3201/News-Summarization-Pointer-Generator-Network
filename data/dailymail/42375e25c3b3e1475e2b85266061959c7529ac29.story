Oscar-nominated French actress Catherine Deneuve has put her sprawling 18th century chateau on the market for £3.2million.

Chateau de Primard, set in a leafy pocket west of Paris, boasts a home cinema cinema, 750-square-foot sauna suite, and a staggering 530-square-foot kitchen.

The garden, complete with an outdoor pool, was famously designed by landscape gardener Jacques Wirtz, who sculpted the hedges of the Elysee Palace in the capital.

Ms Deneuve, who was married to celebrated British photographer David Bailey between 1965 and 1972, is widely regarded as one of French cinema's greatest exports.

The 70-year-old cinema star made her name playing aloof characters for directors including Roman Polanski and Luis Bunuel - earning her BAFTA and Oscar nominations.

For decades, she has split her time between the 1,300-square-foot estate and an inner-city flat for decades - but now hopes to retreat to the countryside to 'relax'.

With eight master bedrooms, numerous outbuildings, and an outdoor pool, demand for the four-floor property in Guainville, 46 miles from central Paris, has rocketed since it was put up for sale this month by Sotheby's.

The ground floor features a dining room, a 'lounge boudoir', a living room, and the 530-square-foot kitchen.

The 18th century mansion is one of just around 300 homes in the leafy pocket of northern France hugging the Eure river. It was converted into a farm in the 1960s but has since been restored

On the first floor, the future owner will inherit a 700-square-foot master bedroom, a further two smaller bedrooms, a bathroom, guest suite, and a child's room.

Alongside another 700-square-foot master bedroom, the second floor has a 750-square-foot sauna suite, two more children's rooms, another guest suite, and a lounge.

The top floor is made up simply of a lounge and a home cinema.

The estate, was remodelled into a farm during the 1960s, but has since been restored to its 18th century style.

Ms Deneuve, who was married to British photographer David Bailey, is lauded as French cinema's greatest export, but has lived a quiet and solitary life on the estate, locals say

Locals said Ms Deneuve led a quiet life on her own in the village, home to just 300 properties.

She was regularly seen out in the Eure-et-Loir region shopping for plants and mingling with residents.

According to the mayor of Guainville, Jocelyne Poussard, Ms Deneuve also paid regular visits to her 18th century mansion nearby. 

Last month, Ms Deneuve told local media she wants to be in the countryside to relax.

Ms Deneuve recently waded in on the scandal of President Hollande's alleged affair, defending him from a tirade of abuse.

It came after fellow actress Sophie Marceau branded the leader 'a jerk' and 'a coward' - words Ms Deneuve slammed as 'rude' and 'astonishing'.
