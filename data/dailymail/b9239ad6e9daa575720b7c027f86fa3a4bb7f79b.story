Super blogger Tavi Gevinson took a break from her busy Broadway schedule earlier this month in order to offer fans a peek inside her Manhattan apartment. 

The 18-year-old, who has just finished starring in a critically-acclaimed production of This Is Our Youth on Broadway, invited fashion website The Coveteur into the Lower East Side home that she shares with close friend and photographer Petra Collins. 

Focusing on some of her favorite fashion pieces from her diverse and eclectic wardrobe, Tavi revealed that she has managed to collect some truly unique - and priceless - pieces over the years, including a pair of leather gold gloves gifted to her by actress Winona Ryder, who had in turn received them from style icon Audrey Hepburn.

Then there is are the pleated lip-print skirts which she was given by designer Miuccia Prada, and the gold Chanel boots that she received as a gift from singer Stevie Nicks. 

Needless to say, despite her youth, Tavi is already recognized as one of fashion's most successful young writers, having written pieces for the likes of Elle and Vogue and interviewed everyone from Miley Cyrus and Alexa Chung to Emma Watson, who she now counts as a close friend.  

'Lorde, Emma Watson and Sky Ferreira all opened up in ways they don’t normally in interviews and I really appreciated that,' she told The Coveteur, adding: 'I owe so much of my brain to so many people.'

The teen success story first started her career while she was still in middle school, when she founded Rookie Mag, a publication aimed at young people of her own age. 

She admitted that she 'didn't sleep at all' during the first year after she founded the magazine and website, and confessed that it was sometimes a struggle to maintain a healthy balance between her school work - which she labeled as 'pointless' - and the pressures of keeping up to date with all of the content on the site.

Passion or obsession? The writer's passion and dedication to Rookie, which she founded while she was in middle school, is clear to see from the number of personalized knick-knacks scattered throughout her home

'When I think back, there was truly nothing else I wanted to do,' she said. 'Like my mom suggested coming home and relaxing, and I said something like: "If I wanted to relax, I would work on Rookie."' 

There is evidence of her ongoing passion and devotion to Rookie scattered throughout her home - which she shares with one of the magazine's main contributors Petra Collins. 

Personalized jewelry emblazoned with the magazine's name can be found on numerous surfaces, adorning many a knick-knack, while she also keeps a large stack of the magazine's annual print yearbook alongside the various gifts she has received over the years from some of her most famous admirers. 

In addition to her favorite fashion pieces already highlighted by the fashion website, the teenage writer also pointed out a Sulamith Wulfing book, which was another gift from singer Stevie Knicks, and a pair of shoes given to her by Comme des Garçons founder Rei Kawakubo.

Hitting the headlines: Earlier this month, Tavi was unveiled as the newest face of jewelry brand Alexis Bittar, alongside interior designer Iris Apfel

The final curtain: Tavi's Broadway run recently came to an end after months of critically-acclaimed performances

But while her home already looks like she's been there for many years, as opposed to just a few months, Tavi admitted that she hasn't had a huge amount of time to explore New York, thanks to her hectic work schedule for This Is Our Youth.

The relentless performance timetable hasn't stopped her from pursuing new and exciting work projects however. 

Earlier this month, it was revealed that Tavi had been signed up as the face of New York-based jewelry label Alexis Bittar, alongside 93-year-old interior designer and fashion icon Iris Aprfel.

Shortly after the campaign launched, Tavi posted the picture on her Instagram account, commenting: 'So happy to be part of @alexisbittar's spring 2015 campaign next to Iris Apfel, whose style/wisdom/friendship has basically taught me how to live.'
