Many animals can communicate effectively with one another but humans are unique in our ability to acquire language.

Scientists have long questioned how we are able to do this and now a new study suggests that the sound patterns of human languages are the product of an innate biological instinct – much like birdsong.

The U.S. research says that babies are born with the basic fundamental knowledge of language, which sheds light on the whether nature or nurture is responsible for speech in humans.

Born to talk: New research says that babies are born with the basic fundamental knowledge of language, which sheds light on the whether nature or nurture is responsible for speech in humans

While languages differ from each other in many ways, certain aspects appear to be shared across them and these aspects might stem from linguistic principles that are active in all human brains, according to the study.

‘The results suggest that, the sound patterns of human languages are the product of an inborn biological instinct, very much like birdsong,’ said Professor Iris Berent of Northeastern University in Boston, who co-authored the study with a research team from the International School of Advanced Studies in Italy.

Newborns reacted differently to the 'good' and 'bad' types of words in a similar way to adults, the study found

Many languages have similar sound-combinations that occur at the beginning of words, such as ‘bl’, while few languages have words that start with ‘lb’.

Linguists have suggested that such patterns occur because human brains are biased to favour syllables such as ‘bla’ over ‘lba’ and past research has shown that adult speakers display such preferences, even if their native language has no words resembling either bla or lba.

To understand where this knowledge comes from and whether it is a universal linguistic principle or the sum of experience, the team looked carefully at how young babies perceive different types of words.

They used a silent and non-invasive technique called near-infrared spectroscopy to examine how the oxygenation of the brain cortex – the very first centimetres of grey matter just below the scalp – changes in time, to look at the brain reactions of newborn babies who listened to ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sounds such as ‘blif’ and ‘lbif’.

The scientists saw that the newborns reacted differently to the two types of words in a similar way to adults.

Young infants have not learned any words yet and do not even babble, yet they still share a sense of how words should sound with adults.

The researchers believe that this finding shows that we are born with the basic, foundational knowledge about the sound pattern of human languages.

The study was published in the journal PNAS.

People who can switch between two languages seamlessly have a higher level of mental flexibility than monolinguals, a recent study suggests.

Researchers believe bilingualism strengthens the brain's executive functions, such as its working memory and ability to multitask and problem solve.

The psychologists think that as fluent bilinguals seem to use both languages at all times but rarely use words unintentionally, they have control of both languages simultaneously.

Judith Kroll, professor of psychology, linguistics and women's studies at Penn State University, said: 'Not only is bilingualism not bad for you, it may be really good.

'When you're switching languages all the time it strengthens your mental muscle and your executive function becomes enhanced.'

The study, published in Frontiers in Psychology, found fluent bilinguals have both languages 'active' at the same time, whether they are consciously using them or not.

Pointing to bilingual people's ability to rarely say a word in the unintended language, the researchers believe they have the ability to control both languages to select the one they want to use without consciously thinking about it.
