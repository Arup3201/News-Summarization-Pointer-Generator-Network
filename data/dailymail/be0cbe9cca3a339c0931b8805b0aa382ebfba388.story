When a 'charming' property goes on the market, it's often the same story- a pokey space dressed up as a cosy pad by estate agents who are looking for a quick sell.

But in the case of this one-bed flat in London's exclusive Muswell Hill, which was the scene of serial killer Dennis Nilsen's murders, it'll take some serious convincing to make buyers look beyond the building's gruesome history.

According to the Sun, the second floor flat, where Nilsen lived for 15 months in the early 80s has gone on the market for the bargain price of £265,000- nearly £100,000 less than comparable properties in the area.

Scene of gruesome acts: Dennis Nilsen lured men back to his home in Muswell Hill and killed them. The one bed flat at the top of the house is now up for sale

On the cheap: The flat is a bargain-hunter's dream at just 265,000. Similar properties in the area sell for £350,000

'Rare opportunity': The property listing does not mention the  building's gruesome history, but potential buyers have been informed of its previous owner

Bairstow Eves estate agents say they are 'delighted to offer' the flat, which they describe as a 'rare opportunity' with 'lots of charm'.

Perverse: Nilsen, now, 78, targeted rent boys and the homeless. He strangled them, had sex with the corpses and boiled the flesh off their bodies

The second floor period conversion in Cranley Gardens, Muswell Hill is said to have 'access to loft storage space'.

The serial killer was only caught out after moving to the flat, where he lived in the attic and had no access to a garden.

As a result he stuffed pieces of his victims' bodies down the drain.

After complaints about the smell, a plumber found 30 to 40 pieces of 
human flesh beneath the manhole cover, leading to Nilsen's arrest.

 Eves have revealed the details of the former owner to prospective 
buyers but do not mention Nilsen in their online listing.

According to the Sun, the property 
was first put on the market for £280,000 in February and neighboring 
flats are on sale for £350,000.

The current owner has had the property for more than ten years, The Sun reports.

The owner has shaved £15,000 off the asking price for the apartment which is still on the market six months on.

Desirable area: Muswell Hill is one of London's most sought-after areas. But, according to the Sun, this property has been for sale for sic months

Room with a view: Nilson was caught after he moved to the Muswell Hill flat because he didn't have access to a garden. Instead, he put pieces of his victims' bodies down the drain

The top floor apartment has a double 
bedroom with south-facing balcony, shower room, separate WC, living room
 and fitted kitchen.

Nilsen killed three of his fifteen male victims in the Cranley Gardens house between 1981 and 1983. He is known as the 'Muswell Hill murderer'.

He killed most of his victims in Cricklewood, North West London between 1978 and 1981.

Nilsen's victims were rent boys, 
students and the homeless who he lured back to his home with the promise of food or shelter.

Nilsen attempted to dispose of the bodies by boiling the heads, hands and feet to remove the flesh. He admitted to having sex with the corpses.
