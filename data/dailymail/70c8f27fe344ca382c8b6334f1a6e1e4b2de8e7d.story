The family of a man who died after a struggle with police outside an Oklahoma movie theater released a cellphone video on Tuesday, which shows five officers restraining the man face down on the ground, with one officer holding his head forcefully down.

Minutes later, Nair Rodriguez, who shot the nearly 6-minute video of her husband, Luis Rodriguez, outside a Moore theater earlier this month, starts to scream as he's placed on a stretcher.

'Papa! Is he OK? He doesn't move. He doesn't move! You kill him! You kill him! You killed my husband! Please somebody tell me that he's alive!' she screams.

A police officer assures Nair Rodriguez that her husband is alive and that medical personnel will take care of him. He died later in hospital.

Overreaction? The family of a man who died after a struggle with police outside an Oklahoma movie theater released a cellphone video Tuesday, which shows five officers restraining the man face down on the ground, with one officer holding his head down

Horrifying to watch: Minutes later, Nair Rodriguez, who shot the nearly 6-minute video of her husband, Luis Rodriguez, outside a Moore theater earlier this month, starts to scream as he¿s placed on a stretcher

Desperate: 'Papa! Is he OK? He doesn¿t move. He doesn¿t move! You kill him! You kill him! You killed my husband! Please somebody tell me that he¿s alive!' she screams

Early on February 15th, police responded to a report of a domestic disturbance and tried to question Luis Rodriguez, Moore Police Chief Jerry Stillings said at a news conference last week.

Rodriguez was pepper-sprayed before officers used two pairs of handcuffs to restrain him as he was face down on the ground, Stillings said.

Nair Rodriguez has told media outlets that police beat her husband, but there are no signs of punching or kicking in the video, and Stillings has said there are no indications that batons or other weapons were used.

The Rodriguez family held a news conference Tuesday to release the video. Nair Rodriguez thanked the media for covering the case, but did not take questions.

Heavy-handed? Rodriguez was pepper-sprayed before officers used two pairs of handcuffs to restrain him as he was face down on the ground

Confusion: Nair Rodriguez has told media outlets that police beat her husband, but there are no signs of punching or kicking in the video, and Stillings has said there are no indications that batons or other weapons were used

Mystery: It’s unclear when Luis Rodriguez died. Police said three officers involved in the incident are on administrative leave

The video starts with five officers — two on-duty and three off-duty who were moonlighting as security at the movie theater— trying to restrain Rodriguez.

Once they have him in handcuffs, a police officer comes over and starts talking to Nair Rodriguez about the incident.

She acknowledges she hit her 19-year-old daughter, and the officer explains that Luis Rodriguez became uncooperative and refused to give his ID.

'Is he bleeding?' Nair Rodriguez asks the officer.

'I'm bleeding. That's me,' the officer says.

The video then shows Luis Rodriguez propped up in a seated position against the legs of an officer before he is placed on a stretcher.

It's unclear when Luis Rodriguez died.

Out-of-character: Rodriguez family attorney Michael Brooks-Jimenez said Tuesday that Luis Rodriguez was known in his family and his church as a peacemaker

Ms Rodriguez cried in a press conference on Tuesday as her attorney Michael Brooks-Jimenez spoke

Stillings refused to answer a question last week that asked if Rodriguez was breathing when he was handcuffed.

But Rodriguez's back appears to be moving up and down in the cellphone video as he lies on his stomach.

A
 spokeswoman for the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner's Office said 
autopsy reports are pending a toxicology report, which could take up to 
two months.

Police said three officers involved in the incident are on administrative leave.

Their names have not been released.

Two of the off-duty officers work at the Oklahoma Department of 
Wildlife Conservation, and they have not been placed on leave, according
 to agency spokesman Micah Holmes.

Brutal: The mother and daughter say Luis tried to go around the three cops and two security guards, but they toppled him to the ground and began kicking him

Traumatic: Luihani recalled seeing the blood on her father's disfigured face when officers finally turned him over

Insult to injury: Mrs Rodriguez said the officers took away her cell phone, which she used to record her husband's beating

Before
 the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation took over the investigation 
on Thursday, Stillings said police had viewed the cellphone video and 
made a copy. He said last week that he didn't see anything inappropriate
 in it.

OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown said she could not comment on the investigation.

Rodriguez
 family attorney Michael Brooks-Jimenez said Tuesday that Luis Rodriguez
 was known in his family and his church as a peacemaker.

'Luis
 committed no crime. He wasn't armed. No gun. No knife. No weapon of any
 kind. But Luis was the one who lost his life that night,' 
Brooks-Jimenez said as he stood next to Nair Rodriguez and other family 
members.

Rodriguez’s 
wife, Nair, and daughter, Luinahi, told local media that the two women 
had gotten into a fight outside the theater and Luis Rodriguez chased 
them into the parking lot in a bid to restrain his wife.

‘When
 they flipped him over you could see all the blood on his face, it was, 
he was disfigured, you couldn't recognize him,’ a tearful Luinahi 
Rodriguez said of her father.

It
 wasn't until the man’s motionless body was carried away on a stretcher 
that police allegedly approached his now-widow and asked her about what 
happened.

‘I told them I hit her and he was just trying to reach me. Why didn't they arrest me?’ Mrs Rodriguez demanded.

Mrs
 Rodriguez challenged the police department’s claim that her husband 
passed away in a hospital, insisting that he died on the scene after 
being struck in the head.

‘They just viciously took his life,’ an emotional Nair Rodriguez said.

Describing her husband of 22 years, she said he was a loving family man who was a ‘grizzly bear with a teddy bear heart.’

‘I’m screaming for justice,’ the widow said.
