After a long and distinguished international career with Germany, Dietmar Hamann knows what it takes to reach a World Cup final.

Hamann was in the 2002 team, a beaten finalist in Yokohama as Rudi Voller’s side came up against the brilliance of the Brazilian Ronaldo.

The former Liverpool and Manchester City midfielder has been monitoring the progress of Joachim Low’s team in Brazil, but isn’t convinced they have the qualities to reach the final.

Germany play their second-round clash against Algeria on Monday evening, but the route to the final is treacherous. Hamann is not the type to get carried away by some good form in the group phase.

Written off: This is the worst German team for a decade claims Didi Hamann

Past experience: Didi Hamann (R) was part of the German team to reach the final of the 2002 World Cup

He said: ‘I’m still cautious about 
Germany because in the previous three tournaments they had better teams 
than this one and didn’t win any of them.

‘Bastian
 Schweinsteiger has had a lot of problems with injuries and if he 
doesn’t perform then Germany cannot win the World Cup - it really is as 
simple as that.

‘If you look at the bench they have no experience. They have a team with six or seven players with less than five caps each.

‘They have options with Toni Kroos and Mario Gotze, but they are missing the Bender twins.

‘This
 is a difficult tournament for Germany to win because their route to the
 final is probably France, then Brazil, then Argentina or Holland in the
 Maracana.

‘It is seven games of high intensity and the players have to perform at their very best.

‘Look
 at Neymar - he is 22 years old and everyone in Brazil is putting 
pressure on him to win the World Cup and he has to handle that after a 
very difficult first season with Barcelona.’

Hamann
 is also convinced that Low is indulging the captain Philipp Lahm after 
moving him into a screening role in front of Germany’s back four.

Lahm
 was converted from full-back at Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola 
arrived at the Allianz Arena last summer and he was used in the role in 
their opening three group games.

Hamann,
 who played 59 times for Germany, added: ‘Lahm wants to play in the 
centre because that’s where he has been playing his club football with 
Bayern Munich. 

‘He 
should be playing at full-back, which is his best position. Lahm has 
only been playing for six or seven months in a new position, but it’s 
not enough time to learn it. 

‘It is staggering that he is playing there after just a few months in the role with Bayern Munich.

‘Bayern
 have 75 per cent possession in most of their games, but it is different
 playing for the national team in that role. He has made it clear to the
 coach he wants to play there, so now they are playing with two central 
defenders at full back.’

Benedikt
 Howedes and Jerome Boateng have filled the full back positions in the 
group stage as Germany beat Portugal 4-0, drew 2-2 with Ghana and 
finished with a 1-0 win against USA.

Clinical: Thomas Muller has scored four goals at the World Cup so far

Up
 front they are fearless and Thomas Muller’s good form at World Cups 
continued with a hat-trick against Portugal and a crisp, curled strike 
against Jurgen Klinsmann’s American team in the final group game.

Hamann
 added: ‘Muller is a clinical finisher playing in a team that creates a 
lot chances - you could see that with his goal against USA.

'He is a very
 clever player. His biggest asset is his pace and finishing. He is not 
the most gifted player, but I think his best position is up top because 
he is such a goal threat.’

Impossible: Mesut Ozil will not be observing Ramadan during the tournament

VIDEO Loew with tough decision to make

On
 Sunday, German midfielder Mesut Ozil revealed that he would not be 
observing the strict Muslim religious laws after Ramadan began on 
Saturday.

‘It will be impossible for me to take part,’ admitted the Arsenal midfielder ahead of Monday's second-round clash.

Many
 of Algeria’s players will be fasting and are using a sports medicine 
expert to ensure that the squad’s preparations are not affected.

West Germany were stunned at the 1982 World Cup in Spain, losing 2-1 to Algeria in their opener, but they took shameful revenge. A 1-0 or 2-0 win over Austria in the final group match would see both progress and Algeria go out. The Germans went ahead — and both teams virtually stopped trying. German goalkeeper Toni Schumacher and Austrian striker Walter Schachner are pictured having a friendly word at the game’s conclusion.
