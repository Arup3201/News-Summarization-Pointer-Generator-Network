Promises: Katharina Wagner has said she will pass over her father's letters to historians to be examined

The heirs of composer Richard Wagner have pledged to allow researchers access to private archives to determine the family's links with the Nazis. 

This Wednesday will mark the 200th anniversary of Wagner's birth but his reputation has been linked to the Nazis regime.

However, his great-granddaughter Katharina Wagner has now said she will pass over private letters and correspondence belonging to her father to historians to be examined.

Ms Wagner's father, Wolfgang Wagner, was a former member of the Hitler Youth as well as a  Wehrmacht soldier who ran the Bayreuth festival between 1951 to 2008. 

Twelve Jewish musicians who performed at the Wagner festival at Bayreuth were murdered by the Nazis. 

Ms Wagner, who is now co-director of the festival with her sister, told Der Tagesspiegal newspaper: 'He had a very negative to the Nazi regime and was happy that he was injured as a young man, and therefore got sent back from the front and survived.

'He always said we can be very happy that we lost the war.' 

But a well-known historian has accused the Wagner family of not being transparent.

Hannes Heer, who created an exhibition about crimes of the Wehrmacht, said Ms Wagner did not allow him to look at her father's estate. She said it had not been possible at the time.

But speaking to the The Daily Telegraph, Mr Heer said: 'The facts must come out about the negative role of Richard Wagner.

'Then you can approach the great artist Wagner with a clear conscience.'

Wolfgang's mother, Winifred Marjorie Williams, was born in Hastings and married Wagner's son Siegfried.

Documents between her and Hitler have been discovered by a relative.

Last year a feud broke out between members of the Wagner opera family.

Born in Germany on May 22, 1813, Richard Wagner went on to become one of the world's most influential and controversial composers. 

He is famous his epic operas which made him a favourite of Adolf Hitler. 

There is evidence that Wagner's music was played at the Dachau concentration camp to 'reeducate' the prisoners.

He died of a heart attack in Venice on February 13, 1883.

Katharina Wagner said she wanted family members to turn over every document they have in a bid to exorcise the ghosts of the Third Reich - including 'potentially explosive' letters penned by Hitler to Winifred Wagner, the Englishwoman who became head of the family in wartime.

Hitler considered Richard Wagner, who died in 1883, as the greatest ever German composer.

Because he and the late maestro both 
shared a visceral hatred of the Jews, the music of Wagner literally 
became the theme tunes of the regime.

Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries was used to accompany footage of air attacks.

The
 Bayreuth Festival in his honour is the hottest ticket in the opera 
world with a ten year delay for tickets and is attended by European 
leaders.

But because of
 Wagner's hatred of the Jews - and his family's later love affair with 
the Nazis - his music is banned to this day in Israel.

Katharina Wagner hopes a reckoning with a dark past will lead to a rehabilitation of her great grandfather and his works.

In October 2010 she sought to end a 
post-1945 boycott of Wagner's music in Israel by inviting the Israel 
Chamber Orchestra to play a concert in July 2011 at the Bayreuth town 
hall.

But her own visit to Israel was canceled after hostility from 
Holocaust survivors.

Katharina has previously spoken of her hopes of a 'cooperative working relationship' with members of her family - but has also threatened to go further in seeking court action to get her and other family members to open up about the past if they refuse to do so.
