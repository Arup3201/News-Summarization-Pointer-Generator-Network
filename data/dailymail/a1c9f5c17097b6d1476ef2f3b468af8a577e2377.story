Authorities on Friday were searching for a missing Arizona teenager 
whose car was found abandoned in southwest Oregon as he was returning 
home visiting a friend in Seattle.

The SUV 18-year-old Johnathan Croom was driving was found Wednesday in 
the small town of Riddle, not far from Interstate 5, said Douglas County
sheriff's spokesman Dwes Hutson.

Monica Croom said Friday that her son was traveling alone and was on his way back from Seattle where he had visited a friend.

Missing: Jonathan Croom's abandoned car was found in southwest Oregon. He'd been driving from Seattle to Phoenix

She said he left Seattle around Aug. 16 and was due back in Arizona last
weekend so he could begin classes Monday at Mesa Community College.

'This is totally out of character,' she said of her son. 'He walked away
from his car. The car did not break down. It was not out of gas. There 
was money in the car and the car was unlocked.'

Croom said her son is 'super smart' and 'awesome with computers' and graduated early from Apache Junction High School.

She said he was living with his brother and left July 30 to drive to 
Seattle to visit a female friend. He had been to Washington state 
before.

Croom said her son had Boy Scout training but she has no idea why he would have stopped in Riddle.

Johnathan Croom is 6-foot-1 and weighs 140 pounds and might be carrying a multi-colored backpack, his mother said.

His SUV wasn't vandalized, and authorities have searched the general area where the vehicle was found.

David Croom told Oregon authorities he has not heard from his son since Saturday.

Anyone who thinks they might have spotted Croom is asked to contact the Douglas County (Ore.) Sheriff's Office at 541-440-4471.
