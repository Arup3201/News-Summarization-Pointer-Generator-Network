Outspoken NHL star Dustin Penner has been dropped from a scheduled analyst spot on TSN after making an offensive rape joke and then following it up with a series of equally unfunny remarks. 

The well-traveled veteran and current free agent had been scheduled to appear on TSN's TradeCentre on Monday discussing the hockey league's trade deadline, but that was before his ill-judged tweet.

'Is it always consensual if she's your girlfriend? Asking for my gf...& shortly arriving police,' tweeted Penner, 32, on Saturday night.

Rather than apologize Penner choose to double-down and attempted to justify his remark by tweeting that his girlfriend was in on it too

If the former Washington Capitals winger thought others might share his sense of humour he was sorely mistaken as he received a series of replies from other Twitter uses who called him an idiot and reminded him that rape is never funny.

Rather than apologize Penner choose to double-down and attempted to justify his remark by tweeting that his girlfriend was in on it too.

'I came up with the joke with my gf U idiots freaking out about this', he tweeted.

Cue more criticism for Penner and his girlfriend. 'So your gf isn't funny either, huh?' tweeted one person.

Undeterred Penner chose to continue making light of the situation with another attempt at being funny.

'Is it a rape joke if it's your girlfriend? Is this even my girlfriend?!?' he tweeted.

Unfortunately for Penner, Canadian network TSN had been made aware of his attempts at humor and they responded to one angry tweeter, saying that he would not be on the air come Monday

Penner eventually apologized but even then drew criticism for the rather halfhearted wording of his tweet.

'I see the offensive side of my joke. On behalf of those who laughed, my gf & I included, I apologize. We understand we are awful people,' he tweeted.

After sleeping on it on Saturday night, Penner issued another apology on Sunday.

'My goal isn't to hurt anybody who has suffered. I can see how my words might have done this though. To those who were hurt by it: I'm sorry,' he tweeted. 

Penner also tweeted that the decision for him not to appear on TSN was a 'mutual decision.'
