A Baron’s son who attacked a policeman after drunkenly rowing with his BBC presenter wife has been ordered to wear an electronic tag and abide by a curfew.

The Hon. Edward Charles d’Olier Gibson was found guilty of assaulting an officer at his £1million home after his wife Tanya Beckett called the police following an argument.

The 45-year-old wrestled the policeman to the ground in a scuffle as he tried to arrest him after his 47-year-old wife claimed he had assaulted her.

Strength: Gibson, pictured with his wife at a Mayfair party in 2006, carried on fighting while handcuffed and simply wiped pepper spray out of his eyes. He only relented when armed officers arrived

Despite being repeatedly struck on the 
shins with a baton and pepper sprayed twice in the face, the heir told 
the officer that he was ‘nobody’ and ‘did not have the power to arrest 
somebody like me’.

The Oxford-educated son of Edward Barry Greynville
Gibson, 80, fourth Baron Ashbourne, was ordered to wear a tag for two 
months and abide by a curfew between the hours of 9.30pm and 5am Sunday 
to Friday during which he must stay at his London address.

Finding 
him guilty of assault on Monday at Oxford Magistrates Court, District 
Judge Tim Pattinson said: ‘My finding is that an otherwise law-abiding 
and impeccably behaved man committed an assault that was fuelled by 
wine, cider and whisky against a background of highly-charged emotions.’

Gibson, a former city financier and business journalist, was acquitted 
of assaulting BBC World News presenter Mrs Beckett but was banned from 
driving for 12 months for drink-driving, a charge he had previously 
admitted and fined a total of £2,350 for the offences.

'Dragged by the hair': Mrs Beckett told police Gibson had threatened her and grabbed her hair

Wife: Gibson was found guilty of assaulting BBC World News presenter Tanya Beckett. They married in 2001

The attack on 
PC Aaron Walker happened outside the family’s large five-bedroom 
detached home in Watlington, Oxfordshire, in the early hours of June 8.

Mrs Beckett had called the police saying she had been threatened by her husband after discussing the possibility of divorce.

The
defendant told the court he did not realise Pc Walker was a policeman 
when he came across him after returning home having drunk-drive from a 
pub.

‘It was grappling or wrestling if you like, definitely not 
boxing. I broke away from this person. I said “I do not know who you 
are. I do not know what you want. Please leave me”,’ Gibson said in his 
defence.

During the trial the court had heard that Pc Walker said he 
had feared for his well-being after being thrown to the ground during 
the 11 minute fracas.

An armed response unit had to be called as backup before Gibson was eventually taken into custody.
