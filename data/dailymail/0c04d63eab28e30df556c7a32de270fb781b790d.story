A bus driver mowed down pedestrians and rammed cars, scooters and food stalls, killing nine people and injuring 27 bystanders.

The driver, named as Santosh Maruti Mane, 'went berserk' on a 25km (17 mile) rampage during the morning rush hour, police said.

They chased the bus for 30 minutes through the streets of the central city of Pune, with traffic officers firing on it in an attempt to stop it.

The driver damaged 40 vehicles he was brought to a halt and police arrested him.

He is being held on murder charges.

The
licensed bus driver had driven his route as normal Tuesday, but on 
Wednesday morning jumped into another driver's bus and took off, police 
said.

Pune police chief Meeran Borwankar told 
reporters: 'We don't know why the driver behaved like this. He just went
berserk. We are trying to find out the reason.

'Citizens came forward and literally 
threw children away from the road. He was in such a dangerous mood. 
Ultimately he was held [by police] but the damage has been tremendous,' 
she said.

'He just went berserk,' slamming into people, cars, school buses, scooters and vegetable stands, she said.

Food stalls were reduced to piles of squashed produce and broken beams.

Eyewitnesses said he drove at high speeds on the wrong side of the road.

It was reported that the driver had no complaints against him before today.

College student Sharif Ibrahim Kutty was among the two people who jumped into the moving bus and stopped the driver.

Mr Kutty told a local TV channel he started chasing the bus when it ran over a woman and a child and then hit a car.

'There were two policemen on a motorbike, they fired at the bus to try to bring it to a halt, but the bullets missed the tyres. The bus then ran over the policemen and broke through the police barricade.

'On this road, he killed about eight people,' Mr Kutty said.

'Then he hit a car again, but before he could accelerate, I jumped into the moving bus. Another man came on board and we dragged the driver out of the bus.'

The mayor of Pune, which is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of Mumbai, appealed for calm.
