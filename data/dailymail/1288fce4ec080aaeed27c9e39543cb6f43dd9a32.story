Legend: Wildlife broadcaster Terry Nutkins died yesterday after a nine-month battle with cancer

Television legend Terry Nutkins has died after a battle with leukaemia.

The father of eight, 66, became a household name after presenting BBC shows The Really Wild Show and Animal Magic.

He died on Thursday and his passion for the animal kingdom and nature was an inspiration to millions of children.

Well known for his ebullient personality and unruly long hair,  he also lost the tops of two fingers after they were chewed off by an otter called Edal when he was 15.

His big break came when he joined Johnny Morris on BBC favourite Animal Magic.

He then took on a role on the The Really Wild Show in 1986 and enjoyed seven years of great success alongside Chris Packham, Nicola Davies and Sue Dawson.

Mr Nutkins also appeared on Growing Up Wild and Pets Win Prizes.

Speaking about how his passion for animals was born, Nutkins would bunk off school and then climb over the fence of London Zoo.

The keepers took him under their wing and allowed him to muck out the elephant enclosure.

'It all came about after one day I decided I didn't want to go to 
school, so instead I crossed Regent's Park, climbed over the fence of 
the zoo and ended up near the elephant enclosure. That's when my love of
 animals was completely confirmed,' he said.

'The keepers liked 
my enthusiasm and cheek, and so I learned all I could from them, about 
some of the most dangerous animals in the world.

'I had 
this instinctive bond with these animals. I used
 to go home at night and when I went to bed, I didn't wash my hands 
because I liked to smell the elephants on them,' he told the Guardian.

His agent John Miles said Mr Nutkins died at home in Scotland.

'He had fought for about nine months or so with acute leukaemia, he said.

The Londoner, who is survived by his wife, eight children and eight grandchildren, made his home in Glenelg on the west coast of Scotland, near the Isle of Skye.

Mr Miles said: 'He was an absolutely 
lovely guy and just loved animals, and he was never happier than when he
 was with animals. We will all miss him very, very much.'

Fellow television presenters paid tribute to Mr Nutkins last night.

Philip Schofield described him as a 'delightful man and a passionate naturalist', while Ben Fogle said the animal lover was one of his 'childhood inspirations'.

Nutkins grew up near Marylebone 
station and bunked off school to help out at London Zoo, where his 
expertise with animals became obvious.

He was sent to Scotland at the age of 11 to work with Ring Of Bright Water author Gavin Maxwell and help care for wild otters.

Maxwell eventually became his legal guardian and Nutkins made the west coast of Scotland his home.
