ASBO: Pensioner Christopher Perry, 65, has been banned from talking to his vicar for a decade after leading an online smear campaign

A pensioner who used his blog to smear police, councillors and a clergyman in his neighbourhood has been given a ten-year anti-social behaviour order.

Christopher Perry, 65, accused local police of corruption and threatened to 'bring down' the Methodist minister, who he branded a 'wheeler dealer'.

His bizarre blog called Wolds Eye View  also called a former village mayor an Obergruppenfuhrer – a high-ranking SS officer.

It is believed to be the first time a blogger has received an Asbo.

Perry, a member of the National Union of Journalists, claimed to have previously worked as a local newspaper reporter and as a Home Office crime researcher.

The self-styled community campaigner from East Yorkshire targeted figures in the village of Wetwang, where he lived, and the nearby market town of Driffield.

As well as pestering and photographing the Rev Robert Amos, he targeted town councillor and former Driffield mayor Steven Poessl, ex-police inspector Richard Wood, and a local businessman, Hull Magistrates' Court was told.

After complaints were made to police, he was officially warned about 'harassment' and his blog taken down by the authorities last year.

In October 2009 he published an article on his website containing 'inaccurate information' about 'malpractices' he claimed had been committed by Mr Wood.

Colleagues heard about the blog and it caused problems for his victim at work, the court was told. Ignoring a warning, Perry made further corruption allegations online that month and caused alarm to the victim's wife by contacting her.

Mr Wood, now a town council clerk, denied all the claims, adding they were 'disgraceful and unfounded'.

The court heard Perry began his inquiries when he was given a document said to have been written by a traffic warden accusing officers at Humberside Police of covering up a traffic offence by a councillor who ran a red light. He contacted Mr Wood and Mr Poessl about the claims.

Perry's blog alleged that Mr Poessl  
was the councillor involved, and also called him an Obergruppenfuhrer. 
Mr Poessl said the accusations were untrue and added that he was 
'insulted' by the SS reference as his father had been a mechanic in the 
Luftwaffe.

The court also heard Perry told Mr Amos: 'I'm going to bring you down by the power of journalism.'

Outside court, the clergyman said 
Perry published 'ridiculous' claims that he stood to make millions from a
plan to rebuild his church.

Mr Amos said: 'Nothing could be 
further from the truth. He was also saying I was trying to make money 
from the elderly and prey on them.

'He parades himself as a journalist rooting out fraud and that kind of thing, but what he was writing about was just silly.'

District Judge Frederick Rutherford 
rejected claims by Perry's lawyer that he had a right to freedom of 
expression, telling him: 'It's a nonsense to hide such appalling actions
behind human rights.

'This is clearly anti-social behaviour.'

Under the Asbo, imposed last Friday, 
Perry is banned from causing harassment, alarm or distress or contacting
eight named victims.

He faces jail if he makes any direct or indirect communication by 'any means whatsoever'.

After the hearing, Perry said he was considering an appeal or applying for a judicial review.

He said: 'This is a gagging order that
goes far beyond an Asbo. I think it gives a sign to other people not to
complain about things or challenge anything.'
