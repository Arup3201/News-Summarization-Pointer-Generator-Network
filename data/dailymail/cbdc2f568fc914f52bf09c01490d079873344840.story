Juventus and AC Milan have made their move to sign Tottenham midfielder Paulinho.

The Brazil international signed for £17m from Corinthians in 2013 but has failed to hold down a place under Mauricio Pochettino.

Juventus are favourites to take him from White Hart Lane as they will offer to buy while Milan can only offer a loan.

Juventus, however, have been rebuffed by Manchester City in their attempt to sign Stevan Jovetic.

The Italians wanted to loan the Montenegro international but City will not deal until the summer and even then want to recover the £22m they paid.

City will finalise the transfer of Wilfried Bony from Swansea for £25million rising to £28m, based on achievements, over the next few days

Manchester City have turned down a request from Juventus to take Stevan Jovetic on loan.
