Rescuers are continuing to search for a missing woman who has been missing for more than 48 hours after falling down an uncovered manhole into the sewers during heavy rain.

Yang Lijun, 21, disappeared into a six-metre-deep hole in Changsha, capital of southern China's Hunan Province, on Friday night.

More than 30 rescuers, including police 
officers, firefighters and eight mine rescue specialists, have been on 
the scene since early Saturday but still have not managed to find Ms Lijun.

Disappearance: Despite ongoing rescue attempts over the weekend, Ms Lijun still has not been found

Zhou Gang, head of sewer and road maintenance in Tianxin district, said: 'We have searched the city’s sewers three times, but so far we have found no trace of the woman.'

Gong Chengping, a spokesman for the district government, said the woman’s chances of survival are slim because the fast-running water could have already swept her into a river.

'In heavy rain, the velocity is extremely fast, and it could have carried the woman to a nearby river within 10 minutes,' he added.

Fears are growing that Ms Lijun may have been swept out into a river by the heavy rain and fast-flowing water
