Most motorists have endured a moment where their parking skills have gone amiss and they've ended up in embarrassingly bad positions.

But spare a thought for this poor driver - his coach ended up in Lake Geneva,  Western Switzerland.

Although on the positive side, at least no-one was injured as all the passengers had got off at the  market square in Vevey.

Did someone forget the handbrake? A tourist coach is half submerged in Lake Geneva in Vevey

Roll: The driver parked the bus on a steep slope after dropping off passengers

Investigation: Divers inspected the inside of the vehicle just to ensure there were no passengers on board

The driver parked the bus on a steep 
slope and it ended up rolling into the lake.

It is not clear if the handbrake failed or if there was another problem.

Emergency crews were dispatched and divers 
inspected the inside of the vehicle just to ensure there were no-one trapped.Â 

When they were satisfied it was safe, the large vehicle was pulled out the lake 
by firemen.

It was a large operation to undertake - the coach had to be pulled from the depths of the lake to the 
shallow sides and then up the steep slope.

Moving on: The empty bus was parked on the market square in Vevey but rolled away by itself

Rescue: People watch a rescue operation as the coach is pulled out of the water

Causes: The freak accident happened earlier today - it is not known what caused it

Retrieved: The coach was retrieved from the lake and slowly pulled up the slope
