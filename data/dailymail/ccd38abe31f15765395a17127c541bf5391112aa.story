A 101-year-old woman could do nothing but pray for help when she was evicted from her house last September.

And six months later Texana Hollis’s prayers have finally been answered and she is getting ready to move back into her newly renovated home next week.

The centenarian was booted out of her Detroit home of sixty years after her son failed to pay property taxes and it was foreclosed.

Relying on friends: Texana Hollis, 101, lived with her friend Pollian Cheeks after being evicted six months ago - here she talks to Cheeks' granddaughter Jahzara

But thanks to numerous charities and individuals determined to help, Hollis will be back home in time to celebrate her 102nd birthday in May.

After hearing about the elderly lady’s plight the author Mitch Albom and his homeless charity S.A.Y brought the property for $100 dollars from the HUD with the promise of fixing it up.

Through his charities Albom pledged $20,000 to help pay for new walls, floors, ceilings and a roof, a new kitchen and bathroom, carpeting, electric and furnace – with all the work done by volunteers.

Hollis said she 'might have to dance' when she returns to her renovated home, according to Chad Audi, president of Detroit Rescue Mission Missionaries, one of the other charities which fought to help her.

Last September the centenarian wept in her wheelchair as her life-time possessions were thrown onto a dumpster by bailiffs and she was forced to move in with friends.

Two days after she was kicked out, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) said she could return to her home in Detroit.

However the HUD then retracted the decision saying that Hollis couldn’t move back in to the building because it was unsanitary and unsafe.

Hollis said at the time: 'Here I am, 100 years old, and don't have a home. Oh Lord, help me.'

After hearing about her friend's eviction, Pollian Cheeks, 68, offered Mrs Hollis a room at her home nearby.

Mrs Hollis, who once taught Ms Cheeks in Sunday school at St Philip's Lutheran Church, agreed to the invitation and has been staying with her friend ever since.

Officials said her son Warren Hollis had failed to pay property taxes for up to seven years.

Although the home was owned outright by Mrs Hollis he had ignored repeated warnings that they faced eviction.

Mr Hollis said at the time: ‘I kept it from her because I did not want to worry her.’
