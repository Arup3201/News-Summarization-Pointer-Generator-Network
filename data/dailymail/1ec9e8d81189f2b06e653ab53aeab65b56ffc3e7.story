Man of the moment Harry Kane will be handed his first international start for England in Tuesday's friendly against Italy in Turin.

The Tottenham striker continued his sensational breakthrough season by scoring after just 79seconds when he came on as a second-half substitute in England's 4-0 rout of Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday.

The 21-year-old's goal scoring feats, along with injuries to the likes of Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck, have seen Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson opt to play Kane from the start against the 2006 World Cup winners.

Speaking to reporters ahead of the game at Juventus Stadium, Hodgson refused to follow Italy coach Antonio Conte by naming his starting line-up but did confirm Kane would play up front alongside captain Wayne Rooney. 

'I understand why Antonio has done that because this is a friendly match and it's a time to experiment with players,' he said.

'I'm able to (name my team) but I'm not going to. I can tell you that Harry Kane will make his full debut, playing from the start and Wayne Rooney will captain the team. 

'If you really want to know our line-up you will have to wait until tomorrow night when the game kicks off.

Hodgson revealed that the pair have been practicing their partnership together during training, while adding that Tuesday's friendly was an opportunity for fringe players to step to the fore. 

'I think it's nice to see the two of them (Rooney and Kane) on the field together,' he added. 'They've played a lot in training and the other night they could have but they didn't because Harry took Wayne's place.

'So I am pleased to see them playing together in this game and Harry certainly deserves his chance.' 

'We're looking forward to the game and we are taking it very seriously.

'It's an opportunity for some players that haven't been involved in the European qualifying games to show that they deserve to be in the squad and are good enough to take the place of other players that I've selected before them.'

Manchester United captain Rooney expressed his delight at partnering Kane on what will be a 'big night' for the Spurs youngster.

'Its exciting for English football that Harry has come through and has been scoring goals for Tottenham. I hope that continues,' said Rooney.

'It's a big night for him, his first start for England. I'm sure he'll be excited and will go out and give his best.

'Obviously I'm excited to play with him and hopefully we can do well to try and help the team win.'
