They may look more like Wall-E than the raging humanoid robots in 'I, Robot', but these thespian actors are certainly causing a stir.

RoboThespian is the creation of Cornish engineer Will Jackson who had an idea to develop an artistic robot that could react with its audiences.

Six years ago he embarked on a project to create a robot that would save tour guides from tediously repeating the same script each day.

Today, around 35 RoboThespians are delighting theatre-goers and tourists throughout the world.

A nearly completed RoboThespian robot inside the Engineered Arts workshop is tested. The Cornish company, operating from an industrial unit near Falmouth, is the world's only maker of commercially available life sized humanoid robots

Engineered Arts design and production engineer Marcus Hold works on a nearly completed RoboThespian robot. Now in its third generation, the fully interactive and multilingual RoboThespian robot is sold around the world to science centres and visitor attractions, but increasingly to academic research groups and universities where they are used as research and development platforms

They are also trained to recognise gestures such as waving goodbye and are able to copy body poses. They are multi-lingual and can even sing.

But not everyone is pleased with the humanoid robots. Jackson told Humans Invent how one RoboThespian was punched by someone in Germany.

In a separate event Jackson describes how ‘a guy took offence because he thought the robot had looked at his girlfriend’s tits basically and tried to attack it.

‘They said the robot always had a habit of looking low which caused this problem. It never made eye contact, it always looked at people’s mid body’.

RoboThespians have in-built cameras, depth perception and facial recognition allowing them to react and adapt their script accordingly.

RoboThespian's actions are based on a piece of software called SHORE developed in Germany. 
This allows them to compare faces to a large database to extract where somebody is, whether they are male or female, their age and whether they are happy or angry, neutral or disinterested

Jackson’s company, Cornish-based Engineered Arts, is the world's only maker of commercially available life sized humanoid robots.

It produces the parts from an industrial unit near Falmouth with one robot costing around £55,000. They can also be rented out for a day or leased for a year.

Their movements are based on a piece of software called SHORE developed in Germany. 

This allows them to compare faces to a large database to extract where somebody is, whether they are male or female, their age and whether they are happy or angry, neutral or disinterested.

Now in its third generation, it’s not just theatres, science centres and visitor attractions, that are benefiting from the talents of RoboThespian.

RoboThespians recently reached new artistic heights by appearing in a live stage show, the Legend of Robotland: Tria's Star, featuring a completely robotic cast

Mammal-like robots with whiskered 
touch systems, machines powered by slime and dancing humanoids that can 
communicate with humans are just a few of the robots invading the 
Science Museum today.

The International Living Machines conference is including robots that move and sense like animals, biohybrid exhibits 
that mix biological and artificial parts.

The conference is
concerned with the development of future technologies using the 
principles underlying living systems and the flow of communication 
signals between living and artificial systems.

Professor Tony Prescott from the 
University of Sheffield’s Department of Psychology said: 'These 
technologies will have a profound effect on many different aspects of 
our future lives, posing important ethical questions and practical 
concerns that this event gives us chance to address.'

The company claims that increasingly academic research groups and universities are using the robots in their research and development platforms.

The application programming interface (API) is open, which means anyone can extend the software with software of their own. 

A restaurant in Seoul, where robots cook all the food and robots take your order, is also using RoboThespians as part of its operations.  

Meanwhile, three RoboThespians recently reached new artistic heights by appearing in a live stage show, the Legend of Robotland: Tria’s Star, featuring a completely robotic cast.

And TV viewers saw RoboThespian and his glamorous assistant, Marcus, take part in the Ben Earl: Trick Artist show on Channel 4 last month.

The theme of the episode was Science and the object of the trick was to see if a humanoid robot, with a sensor and camera could be fooled by sleight of hand.

‘If you walk past it, it looks at you and it will try and work out what you are doing,’ explained creator Will Jackson in an interview with Humans Invent.

‘It can see 14 to 15 people standing around and it will flick its gaze and attention between them. It is designed to be as natural in its behaviour as possible.

‘Also, from a technical point of view, it’s a hybrid robot, so it is partly pneumatic and partly electric. Most robots are one or the other and generally they are all electric.’

The group is now embarking on a two year project to make a full walking, running, jumping version.

It is also developing a smaller half-body robot which has got a projected face, called Sociobot, which will be designed for the retail environment.
