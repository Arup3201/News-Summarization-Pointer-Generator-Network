It's the exclusive frequent flyer airport lounge that looks more like a five star resort. 

Qantas' flagship first class lounges in Sydney and Melbourne are complete with  luxury spas and lavish restaurants that most can only dream of and many will never actually be able to see.

The 48-seat open kitchen restaurant menu  is designed by Australian chef Neil Perry - of Rockpool fame - and is a far cry from the regular 'plane food' the average traveller is accustomed to.

But only Qantas first class customers and platinum frequent flyers have the opportunity to taste the fine dining dishes from the made to order menu.

Dishes include buffalo mozzarella with broad beans, fennel, prosciutto and mint; black cobia sashimi, horseradish and onion cream on grilled schiacciata; casarecce pasta with bottarga, artichoke, radicchio and hazelnuts and pavlova in a glass with yoghurt gelato, strawberry and passionfruit.
