Kevin Spacey has hit back at accusations made by Toronto mayor Rob Ford and Ford's brother that he doesn't take photos with fans, Tweeting a photoshopped image of himself wedged between the two politicos.

Spacey, who plays cold and calculating U.S. Vice President Francis Underwood on hit drama House of Cards, was reacting to a complaint made earlier in the week by the Rob and Doug Ford, who were backstage at Jimmy Kimmel Live on the same night as the actor.

The embattled mayor said he wouldn't know Spacey 'if I ran over him'.

Ford's brother called the actor 'an arrogant SOB', saying there were strict instructions that no photos were to be taken with Spacey by anyone.

The pair made the comments on their YouTube show Ford Nation, which is named after the mayor's supporters.

Along with the photo he tweeted, Spacey wrote: 'When did Mayor Ford start doing what people tell him to do? All you had to do was ask, guys. Here's your pic.'

During Spacey's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, the actor cracked several jokes at the mayor's expense when Spacey appeared after a brief cameo by Ford.

'That's the first time I've had to follow a Ford,' Spacey quipped.

'And one that was so banged up.'

When Kimmel thanked Spacey for sharing a dressing room with the mayor, Spacey responded: 'Well, he threw up all over it, but those are the chances you take.'

Ford has been under great pressure to resign since he admitted smoking crack last year, and several videos have emerged that showed him seemingly drunk or high.

His antics have made him the target of late-night television comedians and embarrassed Canadians.

City Council stripped him of many of his powers but does not have the authority to remove him.

Undaunted, Ford has vowed to run for re-election this fall.
