Three NHS surgeons have been banned from performing operations on cancer patients after at least five deaths, it has emerged.

Lawyers are also probing another 17 cases in which patients may have died or suffered complications after botched surgery by the men.

Despite the ban, the doctors are still being allowed to carry out other surgical procedures for an NHS Trust in Kent.

The three surgeons – all who work for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust – have been prohibited from undertaking keyhole surgery for upper gastrointestinal cancer.

Five people who underwent the procedure are known to have died but it is feared there could be many more victims of the operations.

Families of patients who died after the surgeons used the technique are set to sue the trust for negligence, according to reports in the Sunday Telegraph. They have accused hospital bosses of a cover-up and failing to tell them why their loved ones died.

Rosemary Coleman, whose husband Philip died aged 63 after months of agony following a keyhole operation, said: 'I can't believe these surgeons are being allowed to carry out any work at the hospital when there's still so many questions hanging over the way they carried out this procedure.'

As well as still working for the trust, the three surgeons, Professor Amir Nisar, Haythem Ali and Ahmed Hamouda are also working privately.

No further disciplinary action has been taken against the doctors by the trust itself, even though they have been referred to the General Medical Council.

The GMC is now considering whether to investigate their fitness to practice.

Fears have been raised that the doctors may have been too enthusiastic about using the keyhole procedure to enhance their own prestige.

A 51-year-old man died within half an hour of a second operation held to correct problems caused by an original GI procedure.

His partner told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We still don't know if it was the procedure itself that was wrong or if it was the surgeon's technique that was at fault.

'We need a proper explanation so that this never happens again to anyone else.' The trust referred itself to the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) after a number of 'unexpected' and 'potentially avoidable' deaths following GI surgery in 2012 and 2013.

Following an investigation by the college, the operations were stopped and it was warned the surgeons had 'not been able to demonstrate sufficient attention to the detail of surgical outcomes or clinical decision-making to provide a safe service to patients' with regards to keyhole procedures.

Despite pleas from family members, the trust has still not released the full RCS report.

A spokesman for the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said: 'The trust accepted and implemented recommendations from the review that the consultants providing this service should no longer carry out laparoscopic upper GI cancer surgery.

'There is no clinical evidence that this should be extended to general surgery that the consultants undertake.'
