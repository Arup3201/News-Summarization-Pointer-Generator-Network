Arsenal are set to sign David Beckham’s son Brooklyn on academy terms when he turns 16 in March.

Brooklyn, 15, trains at the club’s academy and plays regularly for their Under 16s.

Regulations forbid clubs from signing players until they are 16 before signing them on professional terms at 17.

Meanwhile, Gunners forward Lukas Podolski has provided the clearest indication yet that he is open to leaving in January.

The Germany international has grown frustrated at his lack of game time.

‘Of course I am not happy with my situation right now,’ Podolski said.

‘I can’t be satisfied with that. We’ll see what happens in January.

‘It is hard when you can’t do what you love. I don’t know why that is, you’d have to ask my coach (Arsene Wenger) in England

‘People can’t say you’re not playing well if you’re not given the chance. If you only come in for eight or 10 minutes it is hard to get into the game.’
