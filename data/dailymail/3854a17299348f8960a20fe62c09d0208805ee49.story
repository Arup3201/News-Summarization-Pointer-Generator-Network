Twitter trolls posted vile messages about the parents of Madeleine McCann yesterday in the run up to the Crimewatch appeal on their missing daughter.

Kate and Gerry McCann were subjected to appalling taunts as they prepared to go on TV to discuss the case.

One troll tweeted a mocked-up picture of the McCanns as Moors murderers Myra Hindley and Ian Brady.

Sick: The McCanns were the target of cruel taunts from internet trolls in the run-up to their appearance on Crimewatch

Others cruelly claimed Mr McCann, who has been ruled out of the Scotland Yard investigation, looked like the e-fit images of the force’s new prime suspect.

There were also ‘deeply upsetting’ suggestions from other trolls that the McCanns should be prosecuted for leaving Maddie alone in the family’s holiday apartment.

Internet forums on the McCann case were also awash with disgusting remarks about the Leicestershire couple.

It was the mocked up picture of the McCanns as Hindley and Brady which particularly disgusted friends of the couple.

One described the image, which was retweeted by other trolls, as ‘completely beyond the pale’ and there was mounting speculation last night that it could trigger police action.

Detectives are now monitoring the Internet for vile messages about the McCanns.

Investigation: The McCanns were interviewed as part of a Crimewatch programme with fresh information on the disappearance of Madeleine

A spokesman for the McCanns said: ‘Kate and Gerry do not dignify this sort of abusive material with any comment.

‘But if necessary offensive tweets are brought to the attention of the police.’

In July this year, police arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of harassment after Twitter abuse was aimed at a feminist campaigner and a female MP.

Caroline Criado Perez and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy both complained about being sent vicious tweets on the site.

Labour MP Stella Creasy was told on Twitter she would be tracked down and raped while Tory MP Claire Perry received death threats relating to her fight against pornography on the internet.

Feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez suffered similarly vile online messages - leading one alleged abuser to be arrested and bailed.

In September 2012 the country’s chief prosecutor said internet trolls who post one-off offensive messages may escape criminal charges.

Keir Starmer QC said court action would be taken only where there was a ‘sustained campaign of harassment’ or a direct threat. This, he said, was necessary, to protect free speech.

The Director of Public Prosecutions made his comments as he announced that a semi-professional footballer who posted a homophobic tweet about Olympic diver Tom Daley would not face criminal charges.

He said the comments were not so ‘grossly offensive’ that they should lead to a prosecution.Daniel Thomas sent the message about Daley, 18, and diving partner Peter Waterfield, 31, after the pair missed out on a medal at the London Olympics.Thomas was arrested after the tweet spread around the internet.It falsely suggested that Daley and Waterfield were in a gay relationship and drew a link between homosexuality and HIV.

Under the 2003 Communications Act, it is an offence to send messages online that are grossly offensive.
