A playground scrap saved a boy’s life when it led doctors to discover a dangerous tumour wrapped around his spine.

When Ryan Savage returned from nursery complaining of a tummy ache, his mother Lisa put it down to bruising sustained in rough-and-tumble games with his friends.

But at a check-up, it was revealed that Ryan’s pains were in fact a sign of aggressive neuroblastoma which, if left unchecked, could have become untreatable.

Ryan Savage (pictured this time last year), seven, was diagnosed with aggressive neuroblastoma after a playground scrap left him with a stomach ache

On Wednesday Ms Savage, 32, received the amazing news that, following an intensive course of treatment, seven-year-old Ryan is now free of cancer.

She said: ‘Were it not for the knock Ryan received at nursery, things could have been very different.

‘Neuroblastoma sometimes has flu-like symptoms but Ryan gave none of the signs. It’s often only diagnosed when it’s in its late stages, when it’s too late to do anything.

‘It was an amazing stroke of luck that doctors examined Ryan when they did.’

When he returned from nursery school in October 2009 Ryan, then aged three, rapidly deteriorated.

Ms Savage said: ‘I dropped Ryan off at school in the morning. At midday I got a call saying Ryan had been thumped in the tummy while he was playing, as boys do. It was nothing serious.

Ryan has just been told he is cancer-free for the first time in four years but his parents are aware the disease could return at any time

Ryan (pictured in hospital) has to have further 
check-ups in January but his parents say they are currently just happy 
that he is okay for now

‘But then Ryan refused to eat and was in absolute agony. I took him to hospital, where they first thought the pain was caused by trapped wind. We were sent home, and I was told Ryan would get better.

‘He only got worse. I took him back to hospital where they decided Ryan had constipation.

‘Two days later, he had a high temperature, extreme pain and, worryingly, he couldn’t move his legs.

Ryan (pictured at Christmas in 2010) was diagnosed with cancer in October 2009 after doctors found a tumour wrapped around his spine during a check-up after a playground fight

Ryan (pictured in November 2010) received treatment for the tumour in his back before doctors found more tumours in his chest which meant he required further surgery and chemotherapy

‘I asked to speak a senior trauma doctor
 who requested an immediate MRI scan. When he looked at the result the 
colour flushed from his face.

‘They told me and my ex-husband Tim, who is Ryan’s father, that we had better sit down. They had found a tumour wrapped around his spine.

'We had to prepare for the worst. They said Ryan could have less than two months to live, and he might not reach Christmas.’

Ryan (pictured with his mother, Lisa) was only given two months to live when he was first diagnosed in 2009 and doctors said he only had a five per cent chance of making a full recovery

Doctors estimated Ryan had just a five per cent chance of making a full recovery.

His
 devastated parents, who were living in South Africa at the time, 
mustered all their strength to support their boy through a course of 
strong medication, followed by emergency surgery and a round of 
chemotherapy tablets.

They were told Ryan, who is a little brother to the couple’s daughter Sheila-Ann, 13, had miraculously entered remission shortly before the family relocated to England in October 2010.

But when they got to their new home 
in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, senior clinicians at the Royal Victoria
 Infirmary in Newcastle discovered that Ryan’s situation was in fact 
graver than anyone realised.

Ryan's mother, Lisa, said: 'Were it not for the knock Ryan received at nursery, things could have been very different. It was an amazing stroke of luck that doctors examined Ryan when they did'

‘I
 had a feeling - a mother’s intuition - that Ryan wasn’t in the clear,’ 
said Ms Savage. ‘A professor at the hospital rang to tell me that they’d
 found another tumour in his chest.

‘Not only was Ryan not in remission, he was in fact in worse shape that I’d known. It was a terrible blow.’

Ryan
 was put on a new regime which required him to brave three different 
types of chemotherapy treatments for five days at a time, every three 
weeks. He also received stem cell transplants.

In 2011 he underwent more surgery to remove cancerous growths, including one which was wrapped around one of his ribs.

Ms Savage (pictured with Ryan) said: 'We might have faced a worse-case scenario if we hadn't caught Ryan's illness early. In almost eight out of ten cases, neuroblastoma isn't diagnosed until it's in the last stages'

The
 treatment exacted a heavy toll on Ryan’s body and, exhausted, he took a
 turn for the worse in early 2012. But by March that year the only 
tumour left in his body was a growth behind his heart.

His
 chances of survival began to climb significantly and for the first time
 Ryan’s mother dared to dream that her son might pull through.

On Wednesday, Ms Savage, a former estate agent, was given the wonderful news that the heart tumour no longer appeared on scans.

She said: ‘There’s no evidence of the tumour any more. His blood test is fine.

‘He
 has a curvature of the spine and he has hearing and speech 
difficulties, but with therapy these challenges can be overcome. It’s no
 surprise he’s got some catching up to do - he’s been in hospital so 
many times over the course his life.

Ryan (pictured with his sister, Shelia-Ann at Halloween 2010) has been left with speech and hearing difficulties. He also now has a curved spine but he now has a chance of survival

‘We have another test in January and we’re aware that the cancer might come back at any time, but for the moment, we’re so happy.

‘We might have faced a worse-case scenario if we hadn’t caught Ryan’s illness early. In almost eight out of ten cases, neuroblastoma isn’t diagnosed until it’s in the last stages.

‘If it wasn’t for that punch to the tummy, we would never have known it was there.’

Ms Savage paid tribute to the tireless efforts of the staff who brought Ryan back from the brink.

She said: ‘Chance played a part, but so did a lot of hard work and generosity. If it wasn’t for the doctors and the people who donated blood and platelets, we would have lost Ryan.’

Neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts.

It usually starts in the child's abdomen, often developing in the adrenal glands above the kidneys.

It can then spread to other areas such as the bones, liver and skin.

The cancer affects about 100 children in the UK each year and is usually diagnosed in under-5s.

It is the most common form of solid tumour cancer in childhood after brain tumours.

The symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread.

Initial symptoms often include aches and pains and loss of appetite.

The most common symptom when the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the child's abdomen.

Other possible symptoms are a lump in the child's neck, bone pain, weakness in the child's lower body, anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin.

Because the early symptoms are vague, the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread around the body.

The outlook is better if the child is younger and the cancer is slower growing.

It is common for the cancer to return after treatment and treatment tends to be less successful in older children.
