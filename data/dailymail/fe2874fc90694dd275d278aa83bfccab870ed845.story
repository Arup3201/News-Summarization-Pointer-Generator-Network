Apprentice star Karren Brady has revealed how a potentially fatal illness changed her life forever.

The businesswoman and West Ham vice-chairman was told she had a 30 per cent chance of dying when doctors discovered a brain aneurysm seven years ago.

Brady, who has two children, said surviving the illness made her realise that 'life is short' and spurred her into joining The Apprentice.

The businesswoman, pictured with Lord Sugar and Nick Hewer, said she would not have joined The Apprentice if she had not been ill and said it made her realise 'that life is short'

She told Hello! Magazine: 'I would never have done The Apprentice had I not gone through the experience.

'It made me realise that life is short - and fun - and that you should try new things. I really believe in life-long learning. The moment you think you know it all is when you don't know anything at all.'

At the time, doctors said it was a miracle she had survived giving birth to her children, Sophia and Paolo.

Within a week of being diagnosed, the businesswoman had been operated on.Â 

Her husband Paul said the illness changed his wife considerably.

He said: 'It made her softer and she's less likely to get so fraught about the unimportant things that used to wind her up.'

Brady, who started her working life at Saatchi & Saatchi when she was 18, said she now regrets going back to work within days after giving birth to her daughter Sophia 17 years ago.

She said: 'I regret that, but I didn't understand then.

'In those days, there was no such thing as flexible working or a work-life balance.

'It
is absolutely essential that you take time off when you have a family. I
just didn't know that then and nobody told me that it was okay. I was 
still trying to prove myself so I carried on working.'

Brady said she now liked nothing more than staying at home and cooking for her family.

She
said: 'We rarely go out and I love to cook. We do a lot of Friday night
dinners and Sunday lunches.

'A slow-roast lamb is my speciality, or a 
king prawn curry on a Saturday night.'

In 2002 she became the first woman to hold such a post in the top flight of English football when the team was promoted.

The next series of The Apprentice begins on May 7.
