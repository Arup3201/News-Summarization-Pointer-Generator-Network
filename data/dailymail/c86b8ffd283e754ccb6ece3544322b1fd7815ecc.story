An NHS trust paid two temporary members of staff a combined salary of half a million pounds after they were hired for £1,000 a day.

Luton Primary Care Trust paid Keith Edmunds £265,000 during his 12 months as ‘interim director of commissioning’.

Colleague Chris White received up to £235,000 as ‘interim chief operations’ officer for just over a year.

Criticised: Luton Primary Care Trust, based at Nightingale House in Luton (above), says the £500,000 payments to two temporary members of staff were justified despite claims it paid 'over the odds'

They each received nearly double the £142,500 salary commanded by Prime Minister David Cameron.

Robert Oxley, campaign manager for Taxpayers’ Alliance, said it was a waste of money.

He said: ‘It’s unbelievable that 
taxpayers are paying such a premium for staff who are supposed to be 
interim, yet have been in post for an extended period.

‘It’s a waste of money and a management failure to be paying over the odds by so much for senior staff.

‘Reliance on temporary staff is a 
clear sign the NHS has not got to grips with the problem of costly 
executive pay. Cutting down on fat cats should be a priority.’

A permanent member of staff has been 
hired as director of commissioning while the chief operations officer 
role has been transferred to Cambridgeshire Community Services Trust.

The £500,000 payments follow that of an NHS chief 
executive who was paid £3,163 a day to work on a temporary basis at 
cash-strapped Dorset County Hospital - nearly twice as much as a nurse takes home in a month.

Derek Smith received £387,220 for the 141 days he worked.

Over the odds: Derek Smith (left) was paid £3,163 a day by Dorset County Hospital. His salary and those of the Luton PCT bosses far exceed David Cameron's

When
he was hired, the hospital was £5.1million in the red and has since 
reduced staff levels through natural wastage to cut costs.

A spokesman for Luton Primary Care 
Trust, based at Nightingale House in Inkerman Street, Luton, said the 
salaries, revealed in an annual report, were justified.

He said: ‘We paid the going daily rates to the interim agency for the levels of responsibility required.’

It has emerged that health trusts are 
spending nearly £16million a year paying recruitment firms to hire 
highly paid senior executives and bureaucrats.

Last year, primary care trusts and 
strategic health authorities spent an estimated £15.9million paying 
recruitment firms to hire managers, Freedom of Information figures 
revealed.

Over the past three years they spent 
nearly £50million – the equivalent of hiring 2,040 extra nurses, 650 
consultants or 1,300 midwives.

Pledge: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has vowed to cut NHS management costs by 45 per cent over the next four years

In one example, a primary care trust 
paid a headhunting agency more than £111,000 trying to fill  the post of
its chief executive – only to  promote its own deputy into the role 
months later.

Solihull Primary Care Trust paid £110,919 to recruitment agency ATM Consulting over two years to find a chief executive.

It later appointed its own deputy 
Claire Molloy, who had been acting chief for those two years. She is now
on a salary of up to £125,000.

Yorkshire and Humber Strategic Health
Authority spent £45,000 over two years paying the same firm to recruit 
chief executive Bill McCarthy.

He has a salary of up to £115,000 and pension pot of £1,001,000.

And North East Lincolnshire PCT paid £167,500 trying to recruit a director of public health, on a £45,000 salary.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has 
pledged to reduce expenditure on managers and pen-pushers by 45 per cent
over the next four years, claiming the money saved will be ploughed 
back into patient care.
