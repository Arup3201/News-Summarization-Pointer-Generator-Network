Russia has acknowledged that the propulsion unit on one of the rockets responsible for the deadly Syrian chemical attack indicates it was made by a Soviet plant in Siberia.

But Moscow experts claim the remnants of the ‘antique’ weapon provide new evidence the sarin blast was the work of rebels and not the Damascus regime.

President Assad’s military machine would not have used this ‘ancient junk’ for a chemical attack when they have far more up to date missiles, said one.

The first missile was ‘a 140-mm M-14-series rocket projectile from an old Soviet-made BM-14-17 multiple-launch system dating from 1952,’ said Ruslan Pukhov, director of Russia’s Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.

The numbering and Cyrillic letters show it is from  Sibselmash plant in Novosibirsk, which during the Cold War was ‘one of the USSR’s main producers of various types of unguided rocket projectiles.

‘The code 4-67-179 means the 4th batch in 1967 by factory 179,’he said.

Pukhov claimed it was ‘unlikely’ the USSR had sold chemical weapons to Syria but said that in any case ‘an old munition has clearly been improvised to take chemicals.

‘We know that the Syrians took the BM-14-17 out of service long ago and M-14-series projectiles for that weapon are long past their storage deadlines.’

The Russian expert said: ‘If they wanted to use chemical munitions then they probably would not have wanted to risk it with antiques like these and instead would have gone for the BM-21 Grad, for which they probably do have chemical munitions.

‘But the insurgents could have found this ancient junk after capturing some military storage depot.’

The second projectile identified by weapons inspectors looked to be ‘home made’.

Blaming the Assad opposition for the attack, he claimed: ‘The Syrian army is unlikely to be making and using such primitive munitions.’

Meanwhile, Russia claimed today it was handed new materials by the Syrian regime implicating rebels in the chemical attack outside Damascus on August 21.

Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, said after meeting top officials in Damascus: ‘The corresponding materials were handed to the Russian side. We were told that they were evidence that the rebels are implicated in the chemical attack.’

He said that Russia would ‘examine the Syrian materials implicating the rebels with the utmost seriousness.’

Russia has repeatedly expressed suspicion that the chemical attack was a ‘provocation’ staged by the rebels with the aim of attracting Western military intervention in the conflict.

Mr Ryabkov also claimed this week’s UN report into the chemical attack was ‘politicised, biased and one-sided’.
