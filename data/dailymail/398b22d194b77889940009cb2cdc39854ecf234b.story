One victim in California was left looking like he had been shot in the face, while police in Florida first believed another was stabbed.

But two were actually injured during minor car crashes, and what eventually killed them wasn't a deadly hazard inside the vehicle but instead  a supposed safety feature.

Investigators tied the horrific outcomes to airbags manufactured by the Japanese company Takata, 8 million of which were recalled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Victim: A lawsuit alleges that Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando was struck by plastic and metal shrapnel after a Takata airbag deployed in her 2001 Honda Accord during a minor accident

The  airbags are equipped in cars made by 10 different auto manufacturers, though 5 million of these are used in Honda and Acura models, CNN Money reports.

Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando died in October after four days in the hospital after a minor crash in her 2001 Honda Accord that caused the airbag to deploy.

Police believed she'd been the victim of a stabbing, and even investigated a 'person of interest' according to her family's lawsuit.

That was before an autopsy last week that revealed metal and plastic fragments from an exploding airbag caused her death.

After he ran his 2002 Acura TL into a wall in 2013, Devin Xu, 47, died in a similar way as Tran, though investigators originally thought he'd been the victim of a shooting.

Reuters reports that two others were killed with wounds to the neck after their airbags exploded following a crash, with nine other serious injuries.

One case from 2010 didn't involve a crash at all. Instead, a lawsuit claims that Kristy Williams was stopped at a red light in her 2001 Honda Civic when the airbag deployed.

Metal fragments sliced into her neck, hitting her carotid artery, and Williams was only able to survive by placing two fingers into the wound to limit the bleeding. 

Afterwards, the lawsuit alleges, she suffered strokes and was left with traumatic brain injury.

Honda has repeatedly expanded recalls of models equipped with Takata airbags, including Accord, Civic and Acura, and had to re-issue recalls in 2011 after it earlier replacement parts were believed to be defective as well.

In October, Reuters found Takata's manufacturing plant in Monclava, Mexico, had a difficult time keeping up with the company's internal safety standards. 

Earlier this month, the New York Times published an investigation that found Takata conducted tests in 2004 that showed inflaters cracking when airbags were deployed. 

When they learned of these results, Takata executives told researchers to delete their data and trash the faulty inflaters, according to two former employees. 

Investigators from the NHTSA are also looking into whether high humidity plays a role in causing Takata inflaters to malfunction.
