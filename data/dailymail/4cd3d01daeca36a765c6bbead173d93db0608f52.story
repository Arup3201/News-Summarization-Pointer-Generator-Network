A son took the stand in his mother's murder trial Wednesday to testify against his father.

Pelle Wall testified in a Salt Lake City, Utah courtroom and described how happy and energetic his mother, Uta von Schwedler, had been in the year before she died, a death that was initially thought to be a suicide but is now believed by authorities to be a carefully plotted out murder on the part of her ex-husband and Pelle's father, John Wall.

Pelle also described his father's erratic behavior in the hours after his mother died, including a moment when he sat down on his son's bed and said to the young man, then still a teenager, 'What if I killed her and I don't remember?'

According to the Deseret News, John had a very tempestuous relationship with his ex, and Pelle testified he would often say negative things about the woman in front of their children, telling them 'Uta's a bad parent' or 'Uta's making my life difficult.'

He said on the stand the two would often argue when it came to the children, and that the last time he saw the two together, John rolled up his car window and drove off with the couple's four children in the middle of a conversation that the two were having in von Schwelder's driveway.

The next morning Pelle said he father was nowhere to be found, and when he returned home from school that afternoon he said the man had a large cut above his eye.

Von Schwedler was found in her bathtub later that day with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of Xanax in her system. 

That night, John woke his son up while he was sleeping and began displaying 'erratic behavior,' saying 'Uta's dead and they think I did it.'

He then asked his son, 'Am I a monster?' and 'What if I killed her and I don't remember?' 

Pelle testified that his mother had never taken any prescription pills or antidepressants to his knowledge, remembering her as 'happy' and 'energetic.'

He also said that while his father initially seemed sad following the death of his ex-wife, that soon turned 'more toward anger, hatred.'

He also noted that after his parents first divorced, while he was still in elementary school, the children spent most of their time with their father, but that had changed in the years leading up to his mother's death, with custody split between the two parents, something that angered his father.

The 21-year-old has long believed his father killed his mother, moving out of his home when he turned 18 and petitioning the court to remove his three younger siblings from his father's care shortly after.

John, a pediatrician, has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder.
