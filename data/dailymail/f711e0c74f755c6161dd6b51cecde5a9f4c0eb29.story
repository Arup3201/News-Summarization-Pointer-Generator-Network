A prolific thief who was fitted with a GPS electronic tag after being released from prison has returned to jail after being traced to seven different burglaries during a three-week period.

Aron Thompson, 26, was one of the first criminals in Britain to receive the device as part of a Ministry of Justice trial to replace the need for defendants to report to police stations or have nightly curfew checks.

However, just three weeks after he was released from prison on November 20 last year, the tag traced him to the location of seven burglaries, including one just five days after he left prison.

He has now been jailed for two years at Birmingham Crown Court after admitting all seven burglaries. His accomplice, 25-year-old Tony Babington, has also been jailed for accompanying him on two of the burglaries.

The court heard how detectives were able to place him at each burglary thanks to the electronic tag which was fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) accurate to ten metres.

Detective Constable Mark Bird, from West Midlands Police, said: 'As part of the pilot, Thompson signed consent forms agreeing data could be taken from it and used in evidence should he be suspected of committing criminal offences.

'Many prisoners are allowed to complete part of their jail sentence in the community on licence but they must abide by strict conditions and if they breach those terms they can quickly expect to be back behind bars.

'Thompson is a prolific thief who, if he fails to change his ways, has a bleak future ahead of him and can expect to spend many years away from society.'

Five days after being released from prison on licence, Thompson kicked his way into a house in Yardley, Birmingham, before stealing laptops and a 42-inch plasma TV.

He went on to commit six more burglaries in the first eight days of December last year, including one at the home of an 81-year-old widow, in Tyseley, Birmingham, where he stole Christmas presents and jewellery belonging to her late husband.

Thompson's accomplice Tony Babington, 25, was also jailed last week after a jury found him guilty of joining him on the break-in, as well as at another in the Yardley area of Birmingham.

December 7, 2013: Thompson breaks into a pawnbroker in Belchers Lane, Bordesley Green, Birmingham.

Babington, of Stechford, Birmingham, was handed a mandatory three-year sentence for being a 'third strike' burglar.

Thompson gained entry by kicking through UPVC door panels and, from most homes, made off with jewellery, phones and other valuables.

When police analysed the tag they discovered that minutes after one burglary, Thompson went to a nearby alleyway where officers later found stolen property hidden in bushes.

Data also found Thompson had entered a pawnbroker in the Bordesley Green area of the city, where officers recovered a gold bangle stolen from the break-in.

CCTV from the shop also showed Babington offering the nine-carat jewellery for sale.

Detectives also discovered a phone registered to Babington was used to contact a pawnbroker shortly after the 81-year-old's home was raided.

A SIM card linked to Thompson was also found in a phone taken from a raid in Acocks Green, Birmingham.

Chief inspector Tracey Packham, of West Midlands Police who led the GPS tag trial, said: 'The tag supports offenders who are serious about quitting crime and allows them to rebuild their life without the need to report to police stations or have the inconvenience of police officers knocking at their door late at night to check they're complying with curfews.

'The tag gives offenders more freedom as they don't need to report to police stations or have the inconvenience of police officers knocking late at night to check they're honouring curfews.

'But as Thompson has found to his cost it also affords irrefutable evidence should offenders slip back into old habits.'
