Winning ticket: Steve Tran bought this ticket from San Jose - and won the lottery with line 'C'

A delivery driver has realized he is the winner of a $324 million jackpot that was drawn two weeks ago after returning from a family holiday and finally remembering to check his ticket numbers.

After finding out about the massive win, Steve Tran, from Northern California, immediately called his boss and quit his job.

He will share the $636 million Mega Millions jackpot with another winner, Ira Curry, a grandmother from Stone Mountain, Georgia, who also picked the winning numbers.

Tran's identity was released by the California Lottery in a press release on Friday but he declined to appear at a press conference.

The California Lottery explained that he had bought five tickets at a store in San Jose the Saturday before the draw while visiting the city with his family.

When he returned home, he added the 
tickets to a pile he had picked up from other cities while working as a 
delivery driver, put them on his dresser and entirely forgot about them.

As
 two winners of the huge jackpot - the second biggest in U.S. history - 
were announced, Tran joined other Californians in wondering about the 
identity of the lucky winner in their state.

'Everybody was anxious, looking for the person,' he said, adding that he thought: 'Must be a lucky man.'

Winner: He bought the ticket from Thuy Nguyen, pictured at Jenny's Gifts in San Jose while on a family trip. Nguyen was given $1 million by the California Lottery for selling the winning ticket

He and his family then went on vacation and when they returned home earlier this week, something clicked in Tran in the middle of the night.

'I woke up in the middle of the night,' he said. 'I remembered, I think I went to San Jose.'

He raced to his tickets and learned that he had hit the jackpot, before waking his wife with the good news and calling his boss.

'I'm
 really sorry boss,' he said in a message on the man's machine. 'I hit 
the jackpot. I don't think Iâ€™m going to come in today, tomorrow, or 
ever.'

The lottery did not 
say how he has opted to take the money, but he has six days to decide. 
If he opts to take the lump sum payment, he will receive about $120 
million after taxes.

Thanks 
to Tran buying the ticket in California, he is not the only winner: the 
gift shop owner who sold him the winning ticket will also receive $1 
million.

'When people hear 
jackpot winner was sold here, everybody want to come here,' said shop 
owner Thuy Nguyen, who only took over four months ago.

The other winner, Ira Curry, came 
forward to claim her prize on December 18, the day after the numbers 
were drawn. She opted to take the lump sum payment.

The
 jackpot is the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history. It started
 its ascent on October 4 and lottery officials said 22 draws came and 
went without winners.

Some $336 million in tickets were sold for the December 17 drawing.

Curry,
 a married mother and an underwriting manager for an insurance firm, had
 previously declared bankruptcy - but now her financial troubles are 
over.

She purchased the 
ticket at the Gateway Newsstand in the Alliance Center building in 
Buckhead, a financial center in Atlanta where she works. It is unclear 
whether she has remained in her job.

When she was revealed as the Georgia winner, she had not yet decided what to spend her win on and was 'gonna take some time and think about it', a lottery spokesperson said.

Unlike in California, the Georgia newsstand that sold Curry her winning ticket will not receive a bonus payment.

The winning numbers were 8, 14, 17, 20, 39 and the mega ball was 7, and the two winners matched all six numbers.

The biggest ever jackpot was in March 2012, when it reached $656million. It was split across three winners in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland.
