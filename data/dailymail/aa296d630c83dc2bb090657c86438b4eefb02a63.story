Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will point out it has not been helpful for 'liberal commentators' to say concern about immigration is 'irrational'

Labour will today attack 'liberal commentators' who are too quick to dismiss the public's 'genuine' concerns about mass immigration.

Ed Miliband's party has repeatedly come under fire for trying to close down debate about immigration by labelling its opponents 'bigots'. But in a speech today, the Shadow Home Secretary will say there is a need for a frank and honest discussion.

In particular, Yvette Cooper will point out that it has not been helpful for 'liberal commentators and business advocates' to say concern about immigration is 'irrational'.

She will go on to say: 'Too often the debate about immigration becomes polarised and unhealthy. On the one hand we now have an arms race of rhetoric involving the Tories and Ukip over immigration. Ukip are exploiting people's fears, fuelling anxiety and division, and David Cameron is racing to catch up.

'On the other hand some people seem to think talking about immigration at all is a problem and they dismiss people's genuine concerns.' 

Mrs Cooper will also promise that, under a Labour government, 1,000 extra immigration staff would be recruited to protect Britain's porous borders.

Controversially, they would be paid for by imposing a £10 visa waiver charge on visitors from overseas. Labour said the charge would apply to people coming from countries such as the 'US, Oman and the United Arab Emirates' who are trusted to return home at the end of a holiday or a short business trip.

Last night Labour insisted the policy could work, pointing out that America imposes a $14 charge on visitors to America, including Britons. It costs the US around $4 to process each application and the additional $10 is used to fund government programmes.

A Labour spokesman said: 'This reform was not beyond the wit of the American civil service, so the Tories really need to examine their basic competence and ambitions for reform.' However Tory officials claimed the scheme would cost 'more to operate than it would recover in fees' – and said the charge would pay for only 59 extra staff.

They also accused Labour of sitting on secret plans to slash the Home Office budget if they come to power. Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'Labour would take Britain backwards and risk a surge in both legal and illegal immigration. This disastrous policy launch shows Labour aren't remotely ready for the responsibility of government.'

Mrs Cooper's speech is likely to be seen as an attempt by Labour to regain some credibility on immigration amid alarm at the way Ukip is eating into its core vote.

Following Ukip coming within 617 votes of taking Heywood and Middleton from Labour, senior politicians have been speaking more openly about mass immigration. Last week Ed Miliband declared: 'It isn't prejudiced to worry about the effects of immigration.'
