FISH AND CHIPS: A HISTORY by Panikos Panayi (Reaktion Books £18)

When I started reading this, I assumed that histories of fish and chips were pretty thin on the ground and that Panikos Panayi had hit upon a comparatively unexplored corner of British cuisine. But how wrong I was.

As he notes in his introduction: ‘This book follows a tradition of volumes on fish and chips.’ These include such seminal works as The Fish Frier And His Trade by one William Loftas (‘also known as“Chatchip”,’) and social historian John K Walton’s Fish And Chips And The British Working Class 1870-1940, warmly reviewed in the Fish Friers’ Review when it was published in 1992.

All of which begs the question: is there really enough to say about fish and chips to fill one book, let alone a small library? The answer proves to be yes. As with the universe itself, no one quite knows where fish and chips came from. While the Portuguese are widely credited with inventing fried fish, and the Belgians with pioneering the chip, it took an unidentified genius to put the two together.

Whether they had joined forces by 1824 remains open to question, but this is believed to be the date of the first reference to an itinerant fried fish seller in the UK. It wasn’t a happy beginning.

A Mrs Rebecca Mendes suffered a ‘Frightful Death By Burning’ when her frying pan caught fire and she went up with it. Charles Dickens’s 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities has a passage about ‘husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant drops of oil’. With due solemnity, we are informed that: ‘This would appear to be the first modern use of the word ‘chips’ applied to pieces of fried potato.’ But it wasn’t long before a thick pall of chip fat hung over the nation.

By 1921, there were about 25,000 fish and chip shops in the UK. Anyone wondering why fish and chips was so popular with the working class needn’t do too much head-scratching. As George Orwell noted in The Road To Wigan Pier: ‘You can’t get much meat for threepence, but you can get a lot of fish and chips.’ Yet however cheap they were, fish and chips never lost the air of being a treat, this being one of those dishes that no one in their right mind would try to cook at home.

By the Sixties, in a bid to retain their popularity, chippies were selling all kinds of deep-fried monstrosities — including spam fritters and, perhaps the greatest artery-clogger of all, the saveloy. Now they’ve changed again, leaving their working-class origins way behind and shooting to dizzying heights of trendiness.

Near where I live in West London, there’s a gleamingly smart fish and chip shop numbering Simon Cowell among its devotees.

As his name suggests, Panikos Panayi is not a dyed-in-the-wool Anglo-Saxon, but he’s been fascinated by fish and chips all his life.

Professor of European History at Leicester’s De Montfort University, he is a bit too fond of words like ‘methodology’ for my liking. That aside, he’s written an affectionate, sprightly and crisply informative history of our national obsession.

The classic dish is now becoming trendy with smart new shops opening and celebrities professing their love of the battered meal

But while we, the consumers, continue to wax lyrical — and nostalgic — about the joys of fish and chips, what of the friers themselves? Surely their levels of contentment must have soared with fish and chips’ changing fortunes? Well, up to a point. Again we come back to that invaluable source, Fried Fish Review, which once noted with brutal honesty: ‘A Frier’s Life is Quite a Happy One.’
