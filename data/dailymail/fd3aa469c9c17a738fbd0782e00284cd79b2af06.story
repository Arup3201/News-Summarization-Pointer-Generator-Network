The mother of a convicted armed robber has been arrested for helping orchestrate her son's audacious daylight bolt from jail in Garland County, Arkansas.

Glenda Estell, 54, was taken into custody on Friday for helping Derrick Estell, 34, escape from Garland County Detention Center where he was being held on armed robbery charges.

Following the escape, officers listened to more than 40 phone conversations that had taken place between mother and son in the month leading up to Derrick Estell's break, including the call he was on moments before he made a run for it.

'The phone conversations between Derrick and Glenda Estell all have random mentions of the plan for Derrick to escape custody, just at various intervals between normal conversations,' according to the police report.

The elder Estell is accused of being part of a network of family and friends that helped orchestrate the getaway.

Derrick Estell, who is still on the run, appeared to be having a regular phone conversation on the inmate phone at 1:40pm on Sunday July 28.

On the other end of the phone was Glenda Estell, who told her son, 'It's all good,' according to the police report.

CCTV shows him crouching on the floor speaking on the phone before he suddenly drops the phone and dives through a window into the prison waiting room and runs out the door.

More footage shows him running across the road towards a getaway car that was allegedly driven by Tamara Upshaw, Derrick Estell's girlfriend.

Another close acquaintance accused of involvement in the plot is Upshaw's stepfather, William Harding, 58. He is charged with creating a diversion by trying to deposit money in the account of an inmate who didn't exist at the jail while Estell bolted.

It's not the first time Derrick Estell, whose rap sheet includes aggravated robbery, burglary, theft, and breaking and entering, has broken out of prison.

In March, the felon escaped from a different jail, but was recaptured hours later.
