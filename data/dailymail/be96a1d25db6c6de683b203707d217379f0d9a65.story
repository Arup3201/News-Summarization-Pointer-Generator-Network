The life of a student involves far more than simply studying, as demonstrated by this incredible stunt.

A student at the University of Arkansas, in Fayetteville, has pulled off an amazing basketball trick, much to the amazement of his friends.

Lobbing the ball from a high-up balcony, it bounces three times from one roof to another before hitting the ground and bouncing up and landing straight in the net.

The ball bounces three times on rooftops far off on the other side of the students' accommodation

Just how many attempts it took before he got the ball to go where he wanted, we will never know. But according to comments on the YouTube video, these students are always coming up with new tricks.

'The tricks these guys pull are getting more and more ridiculous,' posted frostboy4869.

Fellow students on the court below go crazy when the ball lands perfectly in the net. Some students are even hanging out lying on the roofs.

The video, posted by Nick Battisto and labelled Phi Delt Rooftop 'Trix' Shot, was filmed last month at the university campus.Â

One person explains this is 'what we do instead of studying'.

The students are honing the basketball tricks at the Phi Delta Theta brotherhood of the university.

Arkansas University is where Bill and Hillary Clinton began their careers by teaching law. Before she was a U.S. senator or the nation's secretary of state, Hillary founded the university's legal clinic.
