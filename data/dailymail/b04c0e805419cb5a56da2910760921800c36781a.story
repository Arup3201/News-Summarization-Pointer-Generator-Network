Twenty of Britain's most odour-able creatures battled it out to land the top prize at the first ever pet skunk beauty pageant.

The stinky but groomed animals were judged on tail length, attitude and the cuteness of their nose.

And when the ballots were in, they lined up again for the fancy dress round.

Owners spent months preparing for the showdown in Birmingham yesterday.

Competitors at the first beauty pageant for skunks included a pair named after Wayne and Coleen Rooney who arrived in England football kits. But the pair hissed at each other throughout

One couple presented their two skunks, Coleen and Rooney, in his and hers England football strips.

But the stubborn pets, who were having a lovers' tiff, refused to kiss and make up for the ceremony and hissed when they were put near each other.

Hairdresser Sandra Vaughan, 43, has been planning her entry since June, having designed bride, groom and bridesmaid outfits for her pets Essence, Effy and Pepe Le Pew.

But the happy wedding scene became a solemn affair when Essence died three weeks ago.

She said: 'Being an owner of exotic animals everyone you know seems to think 
you're a bit strange, so it was lovely to meet up with likeminded 
people. All of us love our animals and it's nice to be around people who
understand.

'It was such a good day, everyone had a great time and all the animals were so well behaved, except my Pepe. It seems he doesn't like skunks he doesn't know so I'm covered in scratches today.

'We only had one problem, one of the judges at the last minute decided 
he didn't agree with dressing animals up and refused to judge the fancy 
dress.

'He had known he was going to do it for a
while but at the last minute decided he wouldn't so we had to find 
someone at short notice.'

Paddy, an overweight Irish skunk, won the fancy dress round with his vicar costume.

Best in Show and Best Female winner, seven-month-old Jordi Alba, was praised by the panel, including animal 
expert Dr Daniel Allen, for her excitable personality and 'adorable' 
features.

Owner Laura Muir, 29, said: 'The judges said she had a lovely coat, and she is very fit. Just a very very good pet.

Animal expert Dr Daniel Allen was among the judging panel who examined the skunks' personalities as well as their looks and health

Judges had to consider the coats, tail length and temperament of the skunks before deciding who was the winner

'I didn't have to groom her - she 
keeps herself clean. She doesn't stink at all - she only lets off when 
she's really upset so I just need to keep her happy.'

Miss
Muir, an administrator from Telford, has always owned rats but last 
year decided she wanted something 'with more personality'.

She said: 'The thing about skunks, 
compared to cats and dogs, is their character. People say cats have a 
strong personality but skunks are a lot more interesting.

Skyla's owner, 16-year-old Emily Campbell, brought the albino skunk down from Lancashire to compete at the pageant

'And they live for about 13 years, which is much longer than rats.'

At Â£450 a pop, skunks are regarded as a high-end pet by those in the know.

And there's no escaping the stench since laws in 1997 made it illegal to remove the glands that produce the chemical.
