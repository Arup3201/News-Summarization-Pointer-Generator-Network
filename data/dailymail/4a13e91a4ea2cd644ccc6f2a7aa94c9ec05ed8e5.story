A mother-of-three and her landlord have been arrested after she made her 10-year-old son wear a dress and put on make up as punishment for wetting the bed.

Christle Prado and  Keith Driscoll from Winter Garden, Florida, were charged with cruelty toward children and infliction of mental injury on Thursday after an image of the boy dressed as a girl was posted on Facebook.

The disturbing photo, which shows the child with tears streaming down his face, was then shared around a number of social media users, alerting law enforcement officials.

Prado reportedly laughed as she took pictures of her distressed son and when investigators arrived at the house, the boy was supposedly raking leaves in the yard.  

He is now in the care of his grandmother, who says that the boy has a known mental illness and that the abuse has gone on for far too long.

She also claims that the pair also made him take a cold shower, threw ice at him and forced him to run around outside in the dress so all his friends could see him.

She told Click Orlando: 'Tears were just pouring from his eyes, and I guess she seemed to think it was OK.

'I told him that it wasn't his fault and he didn't deserve it. He shouldn't be punished for something that is not his fault.'

The grandmother has now taken Prado's three children into her custody.

The Department of Children and Families added that there had been other investigations involving the woman. The cruelty charge is a second-degree felony. 

Representative Kristi Gray told WFTV: 'It was clear to me and anyone else who saw these pictures that this boy was clearly distraught and fearful about what was happening to him.' 

'It becomes mental injury when the child is traumatized during the event and after the event," said Gray.' 

Sickening: The mother was reportedly laughing as she took photos while her son had tears streaming down his face. The pair also allegedly made him run around outside in the dress so his friends could see 

Distraught: The boy's grandmother, who now has Prado's children in her care, said the abuse has been ongoing. She also revealed the boy had a known mental illness
