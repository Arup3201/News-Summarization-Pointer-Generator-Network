Former Formula One driver Mark Webber is relieved with just a 'stinking headache' and feeling 'pretty bruised' following his spectacular crash in an endurance race on Sunday.

The former Red Bull driver spent the night in a local hospital after his Porsche car collided with the Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni on the 14th corner at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo before his car slammed into the safety wall and burst into flames

Remarkably Webber gave fans and track-side medics the thumbs up but remains under observation in a Brazilian hospital after sustaining concussion from the impact.

'I've got no recollection of the accident or how it happened - the team is looking into the details,' said Webber via his website.

'Thanks to the medical team at the track and here at the hospital who did a great job.'

Former F1 driver Rubens Barrichello posted a picture with Webber on Instagram after visiting his friend in hospital and reassured fans with the caption: 'visiting my mate #Webbo at the hospital. Fans and friends ,after such a big impact he is ok. #thanksGOD.'

Immediately after the crash, any fears of either the Porsche driver or Cressoni being in serious condition were allayed by the FIA in a statement on its official website.

'The race ended under the safety car after a serious accident between the Porsche of Mark Webber and the AF Corse Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni,' said the FIA statement.

'Both drivers were taken to the circuit's medical centre and, after initial examination, to the local Hospital Bandeirantes for further checks, their condition has been reported as satisfactory.'

A subsequent statement on Webber's official Facebook page on Sunday night said he was okay and had been taken for medical checks.

'After his accident in the six hour race in Sao Paulo, Mark is awake and alert,' the statement said. '(He) has been taken to the medical center for further checks.'

Webber would have been devastated to crash out, having qualified for the race in pole position and was attempting to claw his way back to victory from sixth place in the closing stages of the six hour race.

The 38-year-old was extremely lucky to escape the horror crash at Interlagos relatively unscathed 

'On a positive note it's great that the boys in car number 14 managed to bring home the victory which is a fantastic way to finish off the season,' said Webber on Monday.

'I'm already looking forward to getting out there again next year.'

The former Red Bull driver won two Brazilian Grands Prix at Interlagos during his career in Formula One but also crashed on the same corner back in 2003 when racing for Jaguar.

After a 12-year career in Formula 1, former Red Bull driver Webber joined the Porsche team in the Endurance series where he finished ninth overall. 

The Australian has stayed in motorsport with the FIA WEC since retiring from Formula One in 2013
