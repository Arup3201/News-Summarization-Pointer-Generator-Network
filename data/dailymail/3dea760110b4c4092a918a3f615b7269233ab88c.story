Financial action should be taken against Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich over Russia’s annexation of Crimea, a prominent opposition politician in the country claimed last night.

Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama were told by opposition leader Alexey Navalny that Western governments should seize wealthy Russian businessmen’s assets.

Mr Navalny - a former candidate for Moscow mayor - said there should be sanctions against oligarchs who have made a home in the West, like 47-year-old Russian Mr Abramovich.

'The invasion of Ukraine has polarised members of Russia’s elite, many of whom view it as reckless,' Mr Navalny, 37, wrote in the New York Times.

'Real sanctions, such as blocking access to their plush London apartments, will show that Mr Putin’s folly comes with serious costs.'

In addition, Mr Navalny suggested that the assets of Arsenal FC major shareholder Alisher Usmanov, 60, who is worth £11billion, should also be seized. Mr Abramovich is worth £5.5billion.

The comments come as it was announced European Union leaders will today sign a trade deal with Ukraine - designed to give economic support to the beleaguered state in the Crimean crisis.

Mr Cameron and others agreed last night to add 12 names to the list of top figures from the Moscow regime to face travel bans and asset freezes, after what he called ‘unacceptable’ actions by Russia.

US President Mr Obama stepped up 
action by putting oligarch businessmen - including Vladimir Putin's 
banker Yury Kovalchuk - on a blacklist of regime figures who will face 
sanctions from America.

After talks which continued into the early hours in Brussels, European Council president Herman van Rompuy announced the decision to extend sanctions against Russian officials.

He said that a planned EU-Russia summit in June had been cancelled, adding: ‘Russia's annexation of Crimea and of Sevastopol is a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and of international law.’

‘We strongly condemn the unconstitutional referendum in Crimea. We will not recognise the annexation, nor will we recognise it in the future. There is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders on the European continent in the 21st Century.

‘In the absence of de-escalation from Russia, the European Council has decided to expand the list of individuals subject to visa bans and asset freezes. We put forward a list of 12 names to add to the 21 agreed earlier this week.’

He added: ‘Any steps by Russia to 
destabliise Ukraine will have far-reaching consequences. By that we mean
 consequences on relations in a broad range of economic areas. We ask 
the Commission and the member states to prepare possible targeted 
measures.’

Mr Obama's announcement of travel bans
 and asset freezes was met with a Cold War-style tit-for-tat retaliation
 by Moscow, which announced its own blacklist of US politicians, 
including House Speaker John Boehner and former presidential candidate 
John McCain.

Mr McCain 
tweeted a defiant response, saying: ‘I'm proud to be sanctioned by Putin
 - I'll never cease my efforts and dedication to freedom and 
independence of Ukraine, which includes Crimea.’

Mr Obama signed a presidential order 
paving the way for measures targeting key sectors of the Russian economy
 if the situation in Ukraine worsens.

The blacklist of 20 individuals unveiled by Mr Obama in Washington also included prominent businessman Gennady Timchenko and billionaire brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who were judo sparring partners of the Russian president, as well as Mr Putin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov, Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin and Russian Railways chairman Vladimir Yakunin.

Mr Kovalchuk's Rossiya bank, which counts many senior officials among its clients, was the first institution to face sanctions.

Justifying the move to sanction private businessmen, Mr Obama said he was targeting ‘individuals with substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership as well as a bank which provides material support to these individuals’.

Mr Usmanov and Mr Abramovich both have no public connection to 61-year-old Mr Putin or the Russian government, reported the Daily Telegraph.
