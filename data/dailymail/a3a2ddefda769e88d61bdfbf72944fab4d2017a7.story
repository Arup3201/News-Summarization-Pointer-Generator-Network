Just over a year ago, Lauretta Johnnie, 46, was so overweight at 27st, she couldn't walk without the aid of a stick. Today, she's Britain's unlikeliest personal trainer.

Although she's still a size 24-26, she's on a mission to get the fuller figured out of their armchairs and into the gym.

Her fledgling business, Full Figured Fitness, is aimed at larger ladies and although she says anyone of any size is welcome, the exercises are tailored to the overweight.

Good example: Lauretta (right) shows off her moves in front of a class of eager students

Improvement: Lauretta's classes are tailored to fuller-figured gym goers and have proved hugely popular

She said there was a gap in the fitness market for the Fuller Figured Fitness method because there are currently no other classes 'designed for fat people'. She said overweight people may struggle to do some of the moves in a traditional workout because of their body shape and mobility.

She explains: 'If you do something like a grapevine, some of the movements 
are really difficult because they have fat between their legs and they 
just can't keep up.

'When they first come in, I can see them walking how I used to walk and they lack a full range of movement.'

Loretta's own route to fitness started more than a decade ago when she qualified as a fitness instructor.

But an unhealthy diet led to her piling on the pounds and eventually, she was so overweight she was told that she would need a gastric band.

Even after the band had been fitted, 
her weight continued to yo-yo because, as she puts it, 'you can eat 
anything, really. Even unhealthy stuff like chocolate.'

Lauretta said people are sometimes surprised to see someone of her size leading a class but she points out that you don't always have to be slim to be fit

'My weight went up and down,' she 
explains. 'I needed to do more than diet. Something just had to change. I
needed to get off my butt really.'

Her
eureka moment came when she decided to give up her role as a community 
development officer and pursue a business idea that had first struck her
a decade before - fitness for the fuller figured.

A
chance conversation at the local job centre led to a small amount of 
funding being made available and she launched her first fitness class at
the Fit Rooms in Fulham in November last year.

'I get all sizes coming to my class 
because not everybody wants to be slim, some people want to be fit and they aren't always associated'

The
first class attracted 27 people and triggered a flood of positive 
feedback. As her reputation grew, Lauretta was asked to run more classes
and will soon launch a regular class at Bar Rhumba in central London.

Much
to her surprise, not all of the interest has been from larger ladies, 
although as she explains, some people just want to be fit, not thin.

'I get all sizes coming to my class 
because not everybody wants to be slim, some people want to be fit and they aren't always associated,' she explains.

All welcome: The class is open to all shapes and sizes

'People who come range from "I need a chair to exercise" to 
others who are probably fitter than me! I've had people who are size 30 and 32 but I've have people who are a size 8 too.

'The
classes are a good step up 
into exercise and good way of warming up major muscle groups, building 
up your core but also a great way to feel more positive [about 
yourself].

'Exercise is 
integral for tackling obesity. It burns calories, gives you endorphins 
and it acts like a platform that improvements for people's lives spirals
from.

'It changes 
people's lives and it's doable. We don't do star jumps and we warm them 
up and cool them down properly so they come back saying they feel 
better.'

It hasn't been entirely plain sailing though, as Loretta explains: 'Some
people are shocked and you can see them thinking "are you an 
instructor?" and looking me up and down. But most really enjoy it.'

Obesity
is fast becoming one of the biggest challenges facing the NHS, with a 
staggering 62 per cent of British people now overweight or obese 
according to figures released by the Department of Health.

Worse still, the department has forecast that the cost of treating obesity will rise to a staggering Â£6.2bn a year by 2015.

Not right: According to Lauretta, traditional fitness classes aren't always suitable for bigger women

But despite the overwhelming scale of the problem, treating the condition still focuses on diet and bariatric surgery such as gastric bands. So why not exercise?

'It's very important to put together good healthy eating and making positive exercise choices,' says Loretta when asked whether the NHS needs to do more to get fuller figured patients moving.

'I
think a lot of big people think "oh I don't like going to the gym" but they just haven't tried it. I get
loads of inquiries and then people don't come. I think they sit on it and ponder for a 
while.

'I do get people who come and find the class just isn't for them but some who do drop out have other issues.

'I
think a lot of big people think "oh I don't like going to the gym" but they just haven't tried it'

'Some
people who are big are going through drama or depressed and don't come 
back because of that,' she continues. 'It's about encouraging them to make a positive choice.'

At the moment, Loretta is focused on making sure that her Bar Rhumba class is a success but she's got big plans for the future and thinks gyms and other fitness businesses need to to more to become more fuller-figure friendly.

'We need institutional and personal change so classes like Full Figured Fitness can filter onto the high street,' she explains.

'I know this might take a while but in the meantime, I want to try and change as many lives as possible.

'Thousands have been spent on these 
[health] conferences and its not about everyone philosophising. Let's just do 
something and get people dancing and feeling better!'

And of course, she's looking forward to living life to the full now she's no longer hampered by being overweight.

'I used to get tired walking down the road,' she adds. 'Now I can run for the bus without being out of breath.'
