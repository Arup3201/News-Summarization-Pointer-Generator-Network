These eye-popping two-dimensional sketches look as though they are about to leap off the page thanks to Japanese artist Nagai Hideyuki's clever pencil work. 

Hideyuki, 21, creates tricks of perspective by playing with where light and shadows would fall if the object really were coming out to meet you.

Once propped against a wall these vivid optical illusions work perfectly to create a trompe l'oeil effect.

Trompe l'oeil: Hideyuki says he is inspired by English artist Julian Beever's street art, which he does in chalk on pavements

Fresh perspective: Hideyuki uses unusual angles to make drawings that pop off the page, like this seated gremlin

Hideyuki, 21, from Japan, uses just his pencil to conjure up amazing sketches that fool the brain.

His ability to draw so well in three-dimensions came from the restrictions on street artists in Japan. He wanted to work to resemble street art that pops out from walls.

He was inspired by a technique known professionally as anamorphosis as used by British artist Julian Beever who creates similarly elaborate 'three-dimensional' work when viewed from the right angle on pavements using chalk. 

Because of stricter laws in Japan, Hideyuki has been restricted to the 
confines of his sketchbook but it has not stopped him making equally 
impressive artwork, letting his imagination run riot with everything from gremlins to trains to gaping mouths.
