A woman who was hired to trawl online dating portals for thin, white, Jewish brunettes for a 'successful entrepreneur', has opened up about her experience.

Meredith Haggerty, a New York-based writer, scored her unusual job from the man, known only as Josh, after he posted a Craigslist ad seeking an 'online dating surrogate'. She herself was required to be 'pretty, thin and educated', much like the women he was hoping to date.

'Josh's standards for a potential date were strict', writes Ms Haggerty for The Date Report, remarking that although his feedback on her picks was relatively limited, he did point out the undesirable women who 'just can’t squeeze into the slender category.'

The true identity of Josh, who paid Ms Haggerty $100 a week for roughly seven hours of work, remains hidden. But based on her research and the man’s address, she suspects him to be a married father and the founder of a small Manhattan company.

Ms Haggerty’s role was to scout Match.com for suitable women, and five times a week, to send Josh a carefully curated PDF containing the profile photos of ten women he might like to get in touch with.

She created a fake profile, 'JackAndCokeUWS' to kick off her search, describing her fictional creation as a cringe-inducing 'blonde, athletic, never married, cigar aficionado', seeking 'a cook in the kitchen, bro in the bleachers, and freak in the sheets.'

To her surprise, the fake profile she created for Josh attracted women in droves: 'The first day I browsed for hours, marveling at how accomplished, pretty and serene the 30-something brunettes of New York appeared to be.

'Their careers, their international vacations, their shiny hair. I found a formidable army of women and stored them away.'

'As unsure as I was about if it was demoralizing to womankind, I was positive it was demoralizing to me'

Ms Haggerty, who Josh deigned 'had a good eye', wrestled with her conscience over leading these women into the potential arms of this 'rich a**hole', as she describes him. Ultimately however, she decided that these were evidently smart women who could probably 'look after themselves.'

Over time, Ms Haggerty found herself getting jaded. The mystery Josh's brash demeanor was clearly rubbing off on her, and in her emails to him, she went from referring to the women as 'nice ladies' to 'this batch.'

Ms Haggerty's one clue as to the true identity of Josh was in the return address on the envelope in which he sent her a check for her work. She Googled the address and floor number and came across a small company run by three 'smiling founders'.

One was apparently 'a forty-something man named Josh'. His short bio read that Josh 'valued the happiness of his wife and kids', writes Ms Haggerty, adding that she still 'couldn't be sure' that he had the right man.

'I worried about these women and this rich married man, these unequal relationships burdened by his wealth and secrets'

She describes picturing the women she had linked this potentially married man with, writing: 'I saw them on their first date, their second and their third, exchanging little gifts and sharing expensive dinners.

I worried about these women and this rich married man, these unequal relationships burdened by his wealth and secrets.'

Ms Haggerty never discovers what became of Josh's dating endeavors, except for mentioning one woman who was 'for certain... making herself subject to Josh's fortune.'

Ultimately, with her social experiment under her belt, Ms Haggerty quit, citing: 'As unsure as I was about if it was demoralizing to womankind, I was positive it was demoralizing to me.'
