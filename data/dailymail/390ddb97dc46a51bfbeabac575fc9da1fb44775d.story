Actor Graham Patrick Martin is allegedly being terrorized by a Twitter stalker who is posting abusive tweets from a fake account.

TMZ reported the cyber bully has created a Twitter account with the Major Crimes star's name and tweets more than 100 times a day.

The imposter allegedly tweeted messages including 'How unlucky I wasn't on board Flight 370?' and 'I sure have the likability of a Hitler youth.'

TMZ reported the fraud is also allegedly abusing the 22-year-old's girlfriend, actress Ginny Gardner.

'I think it's sad dat now at her 30s w***e doesn't look older than 80, but tomorrow she'll look like infinity,' they allegedly wrote.

TMZ claims Twitter shut down the account but the imposter just fired up a new one. It is not clear if that has also been deleted.

The baby-faced actor has reported his stalker to police. A search warrant on Twitter has allegedly been executed.

Martin, graduate of Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York, starred in TV shows including Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Two and a Half Men, The Bill Engvall Show and The Closer.
