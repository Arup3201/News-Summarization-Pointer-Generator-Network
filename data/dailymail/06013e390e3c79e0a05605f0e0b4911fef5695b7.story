He's no stranger to filing lawsuits himself, once successfully stopping Playgirl from publishing some full-frontal naked photos.

But now Leonardo DiCaprio has found himself the defendent for producing the 2013 film Out Of The Furnance - purportedly based on the Ramapo Mountain people of New Jersey - with members of the community saying they were wrongly portrayed as violent, drug-using 'inbreds' and 'hillbillies' and that the movie has caused them emotional distress.

According to court documents obtained by RadarOnline, eight members of the Ramapo Mountain community filed a defamation lawsuit in early January over the film, which starred Casey Affleck, Christian Bale and Woody Harrelson.

The film is about two hard-up brothers - Bale and Affleck - in Rust Belt Pennsylvania, with Affleck's character getting messed up with one of the most ruthless crime rings in the Northeast.

Sued: Out Of The Furnace producer Leonardo DiCaprio - along with seven other people affiliated with the 2013 drama - are being sued by the Ramapo Community of New Jersey, who claim they are portrayed in the film as violent, inbred hillbillies.

The claims in the lawsuit center mostly around a character played by Woody Harrelson named Harlen DeGroat, a psychopathic 'inbred' crime boss who deals hard drugs in the Ramapo Mountains

Out Of The Furnace also stars Casey Affleck as an unemployed Pennsylvanian who gets into trouble with a ruthless Ramapo drug ring

The suit specifically refers to Harrelson's psycopathic characer, Harlen DeGroat, the 'Ramapo ringleader' who deals hard drugs and is 'the most awful human being walking'.

Documents says the movie uses characters with standard Ramapo surnames - such as a DeGroat, Van Dunk and Mann - with seven of the eight plaintiffs in the lawsuit carrying such names.

The suit claims that 'by using DeGroat and Van Dunk surnames in an extremely negative manner and by making several negative comments regarding the Ramapo people in the movie which result in the negative association between the Plaintiffs and the movie'.

The group claims they have been left embarassed and 'continue to suffer emotional and psychological damages'.

'Plaintiffs and their family members are harassed and discriminated against. The children are teased at school. The conduct of the defendants constitutes defamation,' the papers claim.

Leader of the Ramapo - or Ramapough - Mountain community, Dwaine Perry, said Out Of The Furnace was a 'hate crime' upon his people when it was released late last year. However Perry is not listed as one of the plaintiffs on the lawsuit against the filmmakers

'The Plaintiffs are not the worst people, do not live in trailer homes, are not involved in an underground bare-knuckle fight ring, and do not live in a self-contained world of drugs and violence.'

The group are claiming the movie showed Ramapo Mountain people as 'inbred mountain folk from Jersey' who 'have fights' and are 'nasty' and 'crazy'.

The New York Post has also been named as a defendant for a movie review that was published.

They are asking for a jury to award them restitution in 'an amount to be determined by a jury'.

After seeing the Out Of The Furnace - which has grossed $11.3 million - upon its release, Ramapough Indian Chief Dwaine Perry described the film as a 'hate crime' that 'stepped over the boundaries of decency', according to NJ.com.

'It eats up and destroys one's self-esteem, particularly for the children,' Chief Perry said.

'You can't really measure the destruction. It's a massive social humiliation. Not only is it a hate crime, it's an extremely violent crime.'

DiCaprio, along with the seven other listed plaintiffs - including celebrated director Ridley Scott - are yet to comment on the suit.

Out Of The Furnace, starring Christian Bale, was released in December last year and has so far grossed $11.3 million at the box office

According to a 2010 article in The New Yorker, the Ramapo people call themselves Ramapough Mountain Indians or the Ramapough Lenape Nation, referring to old spelling of the river that cuts through the Hudson and North Jersey Highlands.

The Ramapoughs number a few thousand, marry largely among themselves, and are concentrated in three primary settlements: on and around Stag Hill, in Mahwah; in the village of Hillburn, New York, in the hollow below Stag Hillâ€™s northern slope; and, west of Stag Hill, in Ringwood, New Jersey, in the remains of an old iron-mining complex.

Despite spanning two states and three counties, the Ramapough settlements are essentially connected if travelling through the woods, by foot or by A.T.V, the article said.
