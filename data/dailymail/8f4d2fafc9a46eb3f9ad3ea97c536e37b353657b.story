Jenson Button took time out of his hectic Formula 1 schedule to enjoy a spot of shopping in Bond Street, London.

The 34 year old, was with his  fiancee Jessica Michibata as they strolled around a high-end shopping district.

The McLaren driver has plenty of spare cash but decided to just window shop as he chatted away to his partner.

As well as the upcoming Formula 1 season, the pair have their wedding to plan, a task which is turning out to be tricky for Button.

He recently explained that he wants to be fully onboard with the details of their big day, so unfortunately, their nuptials will have to wait.

Button admits that planning a wedding can be difficult and it may have to wait as Formula 1 keeps him busy

He told the Evening Standard: 'I don’t know where it’ll be yet, it’s not a secret I just don’t know. And I don’t know when.

'It’s a lot of planning for a wedding and she wants me involved. I want to be involved so it will be a little while yet.' 

However, he insists that he will be focusing on his career rather than fatherhood once they do walk up the aisle.

The 34-year-old admitted he had to be selfish but he has still committed to McLaren next year

He added: 'I’d find it difficult to have family racing in F1. You have to be so selfish and I can’t be selfish if I have a family.

'Also, I don’t think I’d want my kids walking around with cameras in their faces all day long.

'It’s not the way. I appreciate that with my fiancee - because I want her to be here to support me - we’ll get pictured together but I’ll try to keep my family private.'
