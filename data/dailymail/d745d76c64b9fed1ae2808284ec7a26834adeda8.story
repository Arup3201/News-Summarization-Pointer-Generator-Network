Manchester United midfielder Daley Blind was reunited with Premier League trio and former Ajax team-mates Jan Vertonghen, Christian Eriksen and Siem de Jong on Tuesday night.

Blind posted a picture of the quartet having dinner on his Instagram account, with their other halves also in attendance.

All four played with each other at the Dutch giants, but despite going their separate ways in their careers they have all ended up in England's top flight.

The latest two additions to England's top flight, Blind and De Jong, joined Manchester United and Newcastle United for £14million and £6million respectively this summer, although the latter has endured a frustrating start to life at St James Park after being ruled out for several months with a thigh injury he picked up in training.

Both Vertonghen and Eriksen play alongside one another at Tottenham, with the pair featuring prominently for the north London side so far this season.

Elsewhere, the quarter's former side Ajax remain winless in the Champions League after drawing at Apoel Nicosia, leaving them with two points from their opening two games.
