Passing motorists who saw smoke billowing from a stand of pine trees 
along southern Mississippi's Interstate 10 rescued a woman and her disabled 
sister trapped inside a wrecked, burning sport utility vehicle.

Fifteen to 20 motorists, including a photographer for The 
Associated Press, came to the aid of the women on Thursday afternoon in Hancock 
County.

Photographer Gerald Herbert said the rescuers pulled the 
disabled woman from the wreck first, but getting the driver out was 
difficult.

Fire: Motorists battle a blaze while the driver, Giovanna Demonte, was trapped inside her 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer on a Mississippi highway

Panic: Passers-by rescued the driver's disabled sister from the backseat but had to pry open the car's jammed door. The trapped driver screamed in fear while they frantically worked

'No one had fire extinguishers,' Herbert said. 'We were all 
sure she was going to perish. The sounds of her screams and the sight of the 
fire inching closer to her, that was the most horrible and helpless feeling I've 
ever felt in my life.'

As flames spread in the SUV and the driver screamed in 
panic, those who'd stopped flagged down motorists in a desperate search for fire 
extinguishers, water - anything that could be used to douse the flames while 
others tried to find a way to extricate the driver.

Using extinguishers provided by passing truckers, the 
rescuers were able to control the fire as they worked to free her.

Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Ben Seibert identified 
the driver as Giovanna Demonte, 36, of Picayune, Miss. He said she was airlifted 
in stable condition to Gulfport Memorial Hospital. 'She had serious head trauma. 
Anytime that happens, injuries are considered life-threatening,' he said.

Seibert said Demonte was traveling eastbound on I-10, just 
past the Louisiana-Mississippi line, about 11:30 a.m. when she went off the 
road, overcorrected, and crossed the median. The passenger side of her 2002 
Chevrolet Trailblazer then crashed into a tree.

Police said the driver's sister, Felicidad Demonte, 39, of 
Slidell, Louisiana, was in the back seat and suffered minor injuries.

Petty Officer Melissa Estes, who's based at the Naval base 
in Gulfport, Mississippi but is from Annapolis, Maryland, said she came upon the scene after 
picking up her mother from the airport in New Orleans.

'I noticed the smoke,' she recalled. 'I saw only one person 
so I stopped and ran down there to help. Others also stopped and a couple of 
guys broke the windows to the back passenger seat and were able to pull the girl 
out and her wheelchair. We got her to the road safely. The woman kept screaming 
`My baby! My baby!' I really thought the car was going to blow up.'

Zach Miller, of Hurley, Mississippi, said the entrapped driver was 
screaming at the top of her lungs.

'I kept telling her, `We won't leave you here to burn. We're 
gonna get you out of here,'' he said.

Herbert said a man in a pickup truck tried to pull the car 
out of the valley where it landed and a cement truck eventually joined the 
rescue effort and began spraying water on the vehicle, keeping the flames at 
bay. Others used crowbars to help pry open the car's jammed door and the Good 
Samaritans finally were able to pull the woman to safety.

'She was so blessed that mixer had a water hose,' said 
Harold Catha Jr., also of Hurley, who helped with the effort. 'I know that saved 
her life.'

Catha said he used his fire extinguisher to help put out 
flames that were licking at the SUV's front tires.

'But the flames would abate 
for a second or two, but then blaze back,' he said. 'The mixer was able to put 
water inside the vehicle when the flames were trying to get to her. While the 
water was being poured on her and the fire, they were able to pull the car up 
out of the woods and get her out. It all took maybe 10 to 12 minutes but it felt 
a whole lot longer.'

Seibert, the highway patrol spokesman, said police didn't 
witness much of what happened but are grateful for the efforts of the 
motorists.

Said Seibert: 'We greatly appreciate those who stopped 
because sometimes there are accidents when nobody stops.'
