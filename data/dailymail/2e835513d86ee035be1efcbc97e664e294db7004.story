Efforts to contain the Ebola
outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal appear to have succeeded, even
as the virus continues to spread in the hardest-hit West African
countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, U.S. and African
health officials said on Tuesday.

In Nigeria, no new cases of Ebola have occurred since 
August 31, 'suggesting that the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria might
have been contained,' according to one of three reports released
on Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

In Senegal, healthcare workers have contained Ebola after a
single case was confirmed on August 29. The man has since
recovered.

Virus: The Ebola virus epidemic has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa 

The virus continues to spread in the hardest-hit West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone

The smaller outbreaks in both countries started when
infected travelers crossed borders after the Ebola outbreak in
West Africa had begun to raise alarms among public health
experts. At least 3,091 people have died from Ebola since the
West African outbreak was first reported in the remote southeast
forest region of Guinea in March.

The first case in Nigeria was a traveler exposed to Ebola in
Liberia, who flew by commercial airline to Lagos on July 20,
where he was immediately transported to a private hospital with
symptoms of fever, vomiting and diarrhea.

When the case was discovered in Africa's largest city,
Nigeria declared an Ebola emergency and quickly established a
National Ebola Emergency Operations Center that helped
streamline and coordinate the tracing of contacts of Ebola
patients.

Outbreak: Officials warn tens of thousands may die from Ebola

China's first high-security biosafety laboratory will be ready for use by December, in a move hailed as a 'crucial' moment in the fight against pathogens such as the Ebola virus, officials said Tuesday.

The facility, which has been under construction since July 2011, has been billed as the first in China that will be equipped to handle Class 4 pathogens - dangerous viruses that pose a high risk of airborne person-to-person transmission, which can include haemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, and others.

The laboratory in Wuhan, Hubei province, was built in cooperation with French bio-industrial firm Institut Merieux and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It joins just a handful of labs around the world cleared to handle the most highly pathogenic germs.

The Wuhan P4 laboratory comes 'at a crucial moment', said Institut Merieux president Alain Merieux in Beijing.

'Now we are all working side by side on Ebola,' he added, referring to French and Chinese efforts to address the crisis in affected African countries.  

As of September 24, healthcare personnel identified a total
of 19 laboratory-confirmed Ebola cases and one probable case, as
well as 894 contacts with those patients. In addition, contact
tracers conducted 18,500 face-to-face visits checking for signs
of Ebola symptoms. No new cases have emerged.

The first confirmed case in Senegal occurred in August in a
21-year-old Guinean man who traveled from his home in Guinea to
Dakar to visit family.

Medical personnel learned of the man's possible exposure
from Guinean health authorities after his mother and sister had
been admitted to an Ebola unit on August 26 and identified the
young man as a contact. All three were likely exposed when
preparing the body of the patient's brother - who died of Ebola
in Guinea on August 10 - for burial.

Senegalese health workers identified a total of 67 contacts
of the patient. All were monitored for Ebola for 21 days with no
further Ebola cases. The patient recovered and was released on
September 19. 

It comes as Federal health officials on Tuesday confirmed the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S., a male patient who recently traveled from Liberia to Dallas.

The unidentified patient was critically ill and has been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since Sunday, officials said.

Health authorities have begun tracking down family and friends who may have had close contact with the patient and could be at risk for becoming ill. But officials said there are no other suspected cases in Texas.

The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital patient traveled from Liberia on September 19 and arrived in the United States the next day, without showing symptoms of the deadly virus, CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters in a press conference filmed by NBC News.

The patient, Frieden said, started to show signs of the virus September 24 and then 'sought care' on the 26th. Frieden said two days later the patient was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and isolated.

It has been reported that the patient would not be given the experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp - because there is none of it left.
