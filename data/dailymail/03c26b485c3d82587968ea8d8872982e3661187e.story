E! True Hollywood is a popular American documentary series which delves in to the lives of famous Hollywood celebrities - and now Casey Anthony is being given the silver screen treatment.

The 25-year-old dominated U.S. headlines this year before she was acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter, Caylee, who went missing Orlando, Florida in July 2008.

Her six-week televised trial was described by Time magazine as 'the social media trial of the century' and her tale will be broadcast tonight and includes interviews with a number of people close to the case which gripped the nation.

Given the Hollywood treatment: E! True Hollywood Story will focus on Casey Anthony, who was acquitted of murdering her daughter, tonight

In the full glare of the media Anthony was on trial in Orlando from May 24 until July 5, this year.

She was found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child.

However, she was charged with four misdemeanour counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer.

Those quizzed for the one-hour
special include journalists who were reporting on the case, ex-boyfriends, school friends and her defence lawyers.

The show - E! True Hollywood Story: Casey Anthony airs tonight at 10pm ET (3am GMT+1)

In addition, Zenaida Gonzalez, a 
woman with the same name as the fake nanny Anthony said had kidnapped her daughter, has also been interviewed.

Last week the former murder suspect gave video evidence in a defamation lawsuit brought by Ms Gonzalez, disguised in a wig, 
baseball cap and sunglasses.

The documentary series on E! deals with Hollywood stars and well-known public figures.

It began in 1996, has enjoyed 13 series and there have been over 500 episodes.

Topics covered on the programme include re-tellings of Hollywood secrets, show-biz scandals, celebrity murders and mysteries.

In addition there are porn-star biographies, and 'where-are-they-now?' investigations which look in to the lives of former child stars.

Frequently the show features in-depth interviews, courtroom footage, and dramatic re-enactments.

The show - E! True Hollywood Story: Casey Anthony - about Anthony, once called 'one of the most hated women in America' by a Florida probation spokeswoman - airs tonight at 10pm ET (3am GMT+1).

Throughout the trial her defence lawyer, Jose Baez, said baby Caylee had drowned in the family swimming pool.

That revelation contradicted Anthony's accounts which she had provided to police, which stated her belief that her daughter had been taken by nanny Zenaida Gonzalez.

The real woman with that name - who had no link to the family - said she and her family were harassed and Ms Gonzalez told E!: 'It started going down like, "You're a baby killer, you killed that baby."

'They were going to kidnap my daughters and see how I like [it] and then they started saying that they [were] going to kill them and they [were] going to send them to me in pieces in a box to my house.'

Anthony has hardly been seen out in public since her case was acquitted, in part due to the frenzy and furore created by the verdict handed down.

Further, she has to pay the legal and investigations costs which total $217,449.23 (£138,187.27) and the defamation case brought by Ms Gonzalez still has to be concluded.

Meanwhile a Florida Bar spokeswoman has stated that two complaints pending against lawyer Baez both relate to his role as lead counsel during Anthony's murder trial.

Bar spokeswoman Francine Walker confirmed yesterday that one of the complaints relates to Mr Baez failing to turn over information to prosecutors during pre-trial discovery before Anthony was tried.

Another is related to Mr Baez not informing the court that Anthony was serving a year of probation for a check fraud conviction while in jail awaiting the start of her murder case.
