Under fire: BBC HR boss Lucy Adams has seen a 109 page dossier containing allegations of sexual harassment and bullying at the corporation

Shocking allegations of sexual harassment and bullying at the BBC are laid bare for the first time today after the disclosure of a confidential report to The Mail on Sunday.

The 109-page dossier, seen by senior executives at the BBC including under-fire HR manager Lucy Adams, includes claims that:

The damning dossier – called Bullying And Harassment At The BBC – was compiled by the National Union of Journalists and was one of the pieces of evidence submitted to senior managers at the BBC last December after it commissioned an inquiry into sexual harassment and bullying.

The inquiry, the Respect At Work Review – also known as the Rose Report – was led by Dinah Rose QC.

Despite the allegations, Ms Adams said in January there was ‘not a particular problem’ with bullying and maintained the issue was historic when the Rose Report was published in May.

MPs last night called for an urgent 
review into the dossier with John Whittingdale MP saying he would press 
the issue with BBC director general Tony Hall.

Mr Whittingdale, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: ‘These are strong claims.

'They provide further evidence of a long-standing culture of bullying and harassment of employees in the BBC.

'We want to be assured changes are being made by management and we need to be told what these are.’

Rob Wilson MP said what happened in the Afghan department ‘could easily be described as misogyny’, adding there were now questions over the role of Ms Adams in the Rose Report.

He added: ‘The Rose Report looks increasingly like a PR operation for the BBC rather than a real attempt to get to grips with its own rotten culture.’

The dossier gives details of a claim that a woman was offered a promotion if she accepted dinners with the boss.

‘I naturally declined, but another temporary marketing manager, covering maternity leave, accepted and she was given the job,’ the woman said.

Women in the Afghan department said they were told to cover-up and ‘act like good Pashtun girls’ – and allege bullying is still going on.

One presenter whose boss mouthed the words ‘You’re c***’ while she was on air said her bullying experience left her suicidal.

Another allegation is that one manager was given a pay-off before he had a chance to be disciplined for sending filthy messages to female graduates.

The Rose Report, which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, took testimonies from 930 staff.

It looked at BBC policies and processes relating to sexual harassment and bullying – and led to the Corporation overhauling its bullying and harassment policy.

Ms Adams, who was called a liar during a parliamentary committee debate after being accused of changing evidence on executive pay-offs, told BBC magazine Ariel on January 14 there was ‘no reason to believe we have any particular problems’ with regard to a bullying culture.

When the Rose Report was published on May 2, she acknowledged it ‘does make uncomfortable reading’, but added: ‘Thankfully incidents involving sexual harassment were extremely rare and the BBC culture of today is very different to the past.

'Clearly one example is too many but I was pleased to hear that sexual harassment is not something our people were experiencing.’

One source close to the investigation 
said: ‘Lucy Adams is the woman who was the BBC lead on the Rose Report 
so she knew the detail intimately.

These issues happened on her watch and she is now the woman who is effectively in charge of implementing change.’

Mr Wilson MP added: ‘As head of personnel, Lucy Adams has a lot to answer for and should have been sacked some time ago.

‘The fact she is still there suggests a lack of seriousness.’

The BBC was also accused last night of breaking recommendations in the Rose Report over the case in the Afghan department.

It
was alleged one manager found guilty of bullying was disciplined by a 
friend – counter to guidelines which said complaints should be 
transparent and removed from those in any way connected to those 
involved.

Last week, Daud Junbish, a producer in the Afghan department, was given a final written warning after the BBC partly upheld several complaints of bullying and harassment.

Mr Junbish kept his job, but one BBC insider said the disciplinary action decision was taken by someone known to him.

One woman involved is due to complain about the decision. In December last year, Mr Junbish emailed one woman’s father from the BBC.

Apologising to the woman’s father for ‘stooping to a low level’, he said his daughter had ‘violated the ethics of Pashto, friendship and seniority, as well as those of the BBC’.

The email could have had disastrous consequences as the woman explained: ‘In Afghan culture when you see a woman outside her boundaries then you tell the man in the family to sort that out.

'If my dad was a different Afghan man, he would beat me up, physically, and stop me from work.’

She added: ‘I have been on antidepressants for two and a half years.

'I have to stop it but those made me feel alive.’

Last month former newsreader Selina Scott spoke out against BBC sexism in The Mail on Sunday.

A BBC spokesman said it was now implementing more training and a confidential whistleblowing hotline for staff.

He said: ‘The BBC initiated the Respect At Work review to help tackle any form of bullying and to ensure that staff have the confidence to report concerns.

‘Under Lucy Adams’s stewardship the BBC has made huge improvements in tackling bullying – including bespoke training and cases now being heard outside of the relevant division.

'Recent information showed there were approximately 30 cases of alleged bullying being investigated in an organisation of almost 17,000 staff.’

Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly won an employment tribunal against the BBC on the grounds of ageism after she was replaced by a younger host.

The 56-year-old has also claimed to be a victim of sexual harassment at the hands of a senior BBC executive.

The BBC is long on soul-searching but short on culture change. I wish I could say I was surprised to read these shocking accounts of bullying and sexual harassment, but sadly I’m not.

More than 930 people gave evidence to the Dinah Rose inquiry.

Some have now withdrawn it because they have no faith in BBC promises that they won’t be penalised for speaking out.

Age discrimination: Miriam O'Reilly

At open sessions held for staff to discuss their experiences of harassment and bullying there’s been silence – no one except union representatives have felt they can speak openly without facing repercussions.

After the Respect at Work Review was published, one highranking staff member left the Corporation, accepting her career had effectively come to an end because she had voiced her concerns over an issue that subsequently tarnished the BBC’s reputation.

Measures introduced after the Rose inquiry were designed to cut the grievance procedure for sexual harassment and bullying complaints from 90 to 30 days.

But the deliberation time has doubled to 180 days and some serious cases have not been resolved at all.

Staff who were brave in coming forward with their experiences now feel the people who made their lives a misery at work will get off lightly because there is no real will by human resources to get to the truth.

I gave evidence to the Rose inquiry about a manager who offered me a job, but I then found out he wanted sexual favours in return.

When I went to see two senior members of staff for advice about bringing a formal complaint, they warned me that the BBC would always side with its managers and that if I went ahead it would be unlikely that I would work for the Corporation again.

I was a freelancer at the time and could not afford to take the risk.

The BBC is a national treasure. In terms of the quality of its news output, it can’t be beaten.

But the viewing public has to know that behind this facade a culture of fear is allowed to thrive.

This is because executives are a power unto themselves.

They stick together and guard each other’s backs.
