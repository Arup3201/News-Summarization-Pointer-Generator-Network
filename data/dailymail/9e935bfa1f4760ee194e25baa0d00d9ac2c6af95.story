The U.S. Little League champions are being investigated after the runners up to the title accused the team of recruiting players from outside their district. 

Little League Baseball is looking into Chicago-based Jackie Robinson West for allegedly violating rule that prohibits the use of players who live outside the geographic area the team represents.

Runner-up Las Vegas team Mountain Ridge Little League suggested that because of allegations, the Chicago team should be stripped of its 2014 title.

Mountain Ridge President Kristi Black said that the team's U.S. title 'has an asterisk on it like the one on Barry Bonds' home run record', according to DNAinfo. 

She added that the Las Vegas team 'rightfully deserves to be recognized as the legitimate team that went the farthest'. 

Jackie Robinson West captured the attention of the country last summer for becoming the first team composed entirely of black players to win the U.S. championship.

The team beat Las Vegas in the U.S. Championship, 7-5, to advance to the World Series where they faced Seoul, South Korea. The Nevada team had beaten Jackie Robinson West earlier in the tournament, 13-2.

Despite their loss to a South Korean team in the World Series, the little leagues still earned a trip to the White House to meet President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, according to Washington Post.

But since the games ended, groups from neighboring areas, as well as Mountain Ridge Little League, accused the team's officials of poaching standout players from other districts. 

Allegations have been made that Jackie Robinson West officials created a roster filled with all-star ringers, including players from the suburbs, and secretly expanded league boundaries in a move that helped the team win the title, according to DNAinfo.

Little League International found no evidence of wrongdoing, but the investigation has been reopened, according to ABC.

New evidence was revealed last week when Little League officials met in Chicago, said DNAinfo.

In 2013, Chicago's District 4 league, which included Jackie Robinson West, agreed on 'clearly defined' boundaries. 

Jackie Robinson West's 2014 boundaries, however, allegedly infringed on the territory of other leagues that was protected under Little League International agreements. 

After winning the U.S. Championship, the team made a failed attempt to ask sister leagues to change boundaries without Little League International's permission, according to DNAinfo. 

Per the organization's rules, boundary changes must be approved by district league presidents before they are submitted to the international organization. 

Jackie Robinson West's neighboring districts claim that the team expanded their league's boundaries to take over sections of three sister leagues to pick up star players.

Little League International is meeting to discuss their findings from a review on the Chicago team, said Stephen Keener, CEO of Little League Baseball.
