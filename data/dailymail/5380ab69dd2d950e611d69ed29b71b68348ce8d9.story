The London cable car which will fly Olympic spectators over the Thames will open before the end of this month, Transport for London said today.

Transport chiefs have also revealed the pricing structure for the Emirates Air Line - saying it will cost some spectators as much as £16 to buy tickets for the 1.1km river crossing on the £50m cable car.

Transport for London said the cable car will open to the public at midday on June 28 - almost a month before the start of the Olympics themselves on July 27.

The month-long period before the Olympics will see transport bosses recoup as much as possible of the rumoured £50m cost of the Emirates Air Line.

A 'frequent flyer' ticket for the cable car costs £16, while a one-off, single adult journey costs £4.30 for those who don't have an Oyster Card.

The cost of a single ride for non-Londoners and tourists, most of whom won't have Oyster travel cards, equates to around £1 per minute for the five-minute ride from Greenwich to the Royal Docks.

The Emirates Air Line will link between the 02 Arena in Greenwich and the ExCel exhibition centre, carrying 2,500 people an hour.

The frequent flyer ticket gives tourists 10 journeys at the cost of £16.

A single, adult, pay-as-you-go fare with an Oyster Card will cost £3.20, while a cash ticket for those aged 15 or under will cost £2.20 and the fare will be £1.60 for those using Oyster cards.

Riders will also be able to make a 
non-stop round trip on the cable car, with views of the City, Canary 
Wharf, the Thames Barrier and the Olympic Park, at a cost of £6.40 with 
Oyster.

TfL say passengers with a Travelcard 
or other Oyster cards (including Freedom Passes) will be able to fly for
the same fare but will need to buy a boarding pass from ticket offices 
or vending machines at either end of the route.

It was feared that the network would 
be not be finished in time for the start of the Games on July 27 but an 
application for final approval has been received by Transport Secretary 
Justine Greening.

It means that spectators will be able to use the cable cars to travel between two of the Games venues - the 02 Arena on the south bank of the Thames and the ExCel exhibition centre in east London.

The Emirates-sponsored transport will be the first urban cable car system of its kind in the UK.

The gondolas, which will travel 160 feet above the river, are due to be an eye-catching feature, but are also seen as a vital cross-Thames link in east London and part of the drive to regenerate the local economy.

There will be 34 gondolas carrying 2,500 passengers an hour across the river between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in just five minutes.

Mayor Boris Johnson previously said of the Emirates Air Line: 'Gliding serenely through the air across the Thames will provide a truly sublime, bird's eye view of our wonderful city.

'This innovative airborne travel link will be a vital component in the ongoing renaissance of a vibrant easterly quarter of the Capital, providing a much-needed river crossing.'

The consortium to build and operate the cable car was led by Mace, whose past projects include the London Eye and the Shard Tower in London.

The cost of the cable car was originally estimated at around £25m and it was intended to be funded entirely by private investors.

But, despite a 10-year sponsorship deal with the Dubai-based airline Emirates worth £36m, public money was needed to make up the shortfall.

London now joins cities including Barcelona, Cologne, Hong Kong, Lisbon, New York and Singapore which all operate cable car systems.
