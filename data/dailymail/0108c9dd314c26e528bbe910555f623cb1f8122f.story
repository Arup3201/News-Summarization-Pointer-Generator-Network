A prisoner and his armed escort have been hospitalized after a shooting in a restroom at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Friday afternoon.

Inmate Brent James Taff, 34, was being extradited from Utah to Oklahoma when he asked to go to the bathroom in Terminal C at around 5pm.

When he emerged from the stall, he began punching the officer in the face and head, Tulsa County Sheriff's office said in a statement.

The deputy shot Taff in the thigh and hand, prompting the prisoner to run toward the exit.

He was apprehended by a second deputy and airport officials.

Both Taff and the officer were taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas.  

According to NBC New York, Taff was arrested in October 2014 for violation of a protective order, stalking, kidnapping and threatening violent acts.

Airport spokesman David Magana said an investigation into the incident prompted the closing of the public area around the checkpoint near where the incident occurred.

He added that it is not uncommon for inmates to be transported through Fort Worth. 

No gates or flight operations were affected. No one else was injured.
