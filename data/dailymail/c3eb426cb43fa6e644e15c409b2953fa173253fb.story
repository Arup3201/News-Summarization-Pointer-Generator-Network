Only a handful of police officers caught speeding or jumping red lights are prosecuted, it has been revealed.

Despite tens of thousands of officers being found breaking the rules of the road, only 753 were punished in the last two years.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act showed that 75,434 were caught speeding, meaning that less than one per cent were punished.

It has led to accusations that police officers are routinely let off without proper checks while ordinary drivers automatically face three penalty points and a £60 fine.

Road safety charities said 
the high number of fines cancelled was 'worrying' - and it is feared 
that senior officers are not carrying out proper checks before letting 
police off.

Julie Townsend, deputy chief 
executive of Brake, said: ‘These figures paint a worrying picture. We 
recognise that in emergency situations, especially where lives are at 
stake, police need to be able to respond rapidly, but this must be 
weighed up against the danger posed to the public - especially people on
foot and bicycle - from speeding.

'We believe police and other 
emergency services should be doing everything possible to ensure their 
drivers are not putting people at risk of injury or death, and to help 
put a stop to the scores of serious casualties that involve emergency 
service vehicles each year.

'That
includes having robust procedures to minimise the risks, especially 
around decisions around how fast drivers may go in different 
circumstances and environments.

'It
also means ensuring that drivers are prosecuted if they have broken 
laws unnecessarily and endangered the public, and making sure that 
forces are held to account in upholding strict safety standards.'

In Leicestershire, police were clocked speeding 5,738 times over the two-and-a-half year period - but just three were prosecuted. This works out as one in every 1,912.

Overall, police have been caught by 
roadside cameras nationwide 75,434 times in the last two-and-a-half 
years, but just 753 were prosecuted.

Police forces are able to cancel tickets
given to officers as long as speeding is necessary because they are 
responding to a 999 call or pursuing a suspect.

The figures were released to the MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act.

The total number of officers caught speeding is likely to be far higher as just 19 out of 45 police forces provided a full response to the request.

Breaking the law: The investigation found that 75,434 police vehicles have been caught speeding since 2011 - but there have been just 753 prosecutions

RAC
technical director David Bizley said: 'People understand that police 
officers responding to emergency call-outs should in general not be 
prosecuted, but offences committed in non-emergency circumstances should
be treated as they are for any other motorist.

'People
are bound to think the number of police officers prosecuted is low 
compared to the overall figure of those caught, so it is important that 
the police reassure motorists that they treat their own in the same way 
as everyone else caught breaking the laws of the road.'

John
Giblin, Police Federation of England and Wales roads policing lead, 
said that police need to speed when responding to 999 calls - so it is 
right that they don't face prosecution.

'It
is no surprise that far more emergency services will be captured on 
enforcement devices for exceeding the limit when responding to an 
emergency or call by the public for urgent assistance,' he said.

'Police officers are highly skilled 
and professionally trained to a very high driving standard and the law 
allows them to break the rules only when there is necessity to do so in 
order to carry out their duties.

'In
doing so, an officer is expected to provide justification with 
necessity for any violations and are accountable for their actions.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that officers had to justify their speeding before tickets are cancelled.

'All
officers are required to adhere to the policy for driving standards. If
a notice of intended prosecution (NIP) is issued to the driver of a 
police vehicle the officer is required to justify the use of the police 
exemptions used,' he said.

'A supervisor of at least Superintendent rank will quality assure the matter and either support the officer or not.

'If the matter is not supported the driver is required to deal with the NIP as a member of the public would.'
