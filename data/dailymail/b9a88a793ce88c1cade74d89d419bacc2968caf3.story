Maria Miller’s key justification for her expenses claims was directly challenged by a former aide last night as Tory MPs warned David Cameron the affair had turned ‘completely toxic’.

Phil Heath, who campaigned for the Culture Secretary for years, said the Hampshire property she told parliamentary authorities was her main residence was ‘definitely her second home’.

The former deputy mayor of Basingstoke and Conservative councillor, who now represents UKIP, told BBC South Today: ‘She would come back once every couple of weeks on a Friday to do a surgery then she’d be sheepishly back up to London – her family were there, her children were there.

‘Her house in Basingstoke – whenever we had a meeting there, there was no family there.’ 

His account contradicts Mrs Miller’s claims to the Commons authorities that the property in Wimbledon was her ‘second home’ from 2005 to 2009.

This allowed her to claim more than £90,000 in parliamentary expenses for mortgage interest and bills. She sold the Wimbledon house for £1.47million in February and has moved into a £1.2million country pile in Hampshire.

Mr Heath’s account was challenged by Mrs Miller’s allies, who said he had been thrown out of the party over allegations of bullying and had an ‘axe to grind’.

Claims: He said Mrs Miller would return to the house in Basingstoke (above) 'once every couple of weeks'

Formal apology: Mrs Miller was ordered to repay £5,800 and apologise to the Commons (pictured) last week.

The independent parliamentary standards commissioner concluded Mrs Miller should properly have identified as her main dwelling the London house on which she claimed second-home expenses.

However, the issue was ‘finely balanced’ because of her evidence that she spent significant amounts of time in a rented property in Hampshire.

Mr Heath’s intervention came as Tory MPs expressed increasing concern about the fallout from the row over Mrs Miller, who was ordered to repay £5,800 and apologise to the Commons last week.

The Prime Minister will be confronted over his strong support for his minister in a meeting of MPs tomorrow.

Employment minister Esther McVey criticised Mrs Miller’s 30-second statement in the Commons, telling ITV’s The Agenda: ‘It wouldn’t be how I would have made an apology. But different people have different styles. What we’ve got to do is make sure the public believe in their representatives.’

A senior MP said the affair was ‘completely toxic’ and that Downing Street should either have insisted Mrs Miller issued a proper apology  or asked her to resign.

Concern: Tory MPs have warned David Cameron the affair has turned 'completely toxic'

A poll has found that 74 per cent of voters believe Mr Cameron should have sacked Mrs Miller last week.

Worryingly for Mr Cameron, 69 per cent of his own supporters thought he should have acted.

The findings by ComRes – commissioned by Conservative Grassroots, will be sent today to Mr Cameron and party chairman Grant Shapps.

Robert Woollard, who chairs the group of voluntary party members, said: ‘Mr Cameron’s support of the Culture Secretary is completely irrational.

She has clearly broken the rules and according to media reports she and her allies have allegedly tried to bully and intimidate both the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards and journalists who investigated her behaviour.’

Dominic Grieve, the Government’s top legal adviser, pointedly refused to defend Mrs Miller, saying she had to ‘answer to her constituents’.

She was cleared last week by of seeking to cheat the taxpayer to fund accommodation for her parents, who lived with her, but was found to have overclaimed significant sums through an admin error.

Her spokesman said she accepts she faces a capital gains tax bill on her £1.2million profit from the sale of the house.

A source close to Mrs Miller dismissed Mr Heath’s claims, adding: ‘The committee and the commissioner both said the issue of what was her main home was finely balanced and she did the honest and right thing.’ 

An online petition calling for Mrs Miller to repay £45,000 or resign had 100,000 signatures last night.

Downing Street scrambled to shift its position yesterday on changes to the way MPs police their own affairs.

Number Ten had insisted that David Cameron was happy with the existing system – which sees a committee of MPs and three lay members rule on alleged breaches of the Commons code of conduct.

But yesterday, after Labour backed reform of the Standards Committee, Mr Cameron insisted he was ‘very open’ to amending the system.

Despite warnings from senior Tories that independent regulation raised constitutional problems, the Prime Minister said the current rules, where MPs can ‘mark their own homework’, may not be working. 

‘If there are further changes that people think are appropriate, I’m very open to suggestions,’ he said.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Geoffrey Cox, a Tory member of the committee, raised concerns about external regulation, asking: ‘Who is to do it, and to whom is that person or regulator to be accountable?’
