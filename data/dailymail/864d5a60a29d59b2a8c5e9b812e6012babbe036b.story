Former Celtic forward Paolo Di Canio would consider a return to Parkhead as Neil Lennon's replacement, the Italian's agent has claimed.

Di Canio has been out of work since he was sacked by Sunderland last September with the club bottom of the Premier League table.

But his UK representative Phil Spencer says the 45-year-old would relish the chance to become the Hoops' new manager.

Fired: Despite keeping Sunderland up last season Di Canio was sacked early on in this season

He is quoted in a number of newspapers saying: "Paolo would be keen to speak to Celtic.

"He played for the club and he certainly has a good relationship with the fans.

"There has been no contact between Paolo and the club. But if there was, it's something he would consider."

Di Canio joined Celtic from AC Milan in 
1996 and went on to win the Scottish Professional Footballers' 
Associations' player of the year award in his first season

He quit the club after just one season though following a pay dispute with then owner Fergus McCann before moving to Sheffield Wednesday.

Di Canio later joined West Ham where he became a cult hero and scored some sensational goals, later in his career he returned to Lazio.

His spell in charge at the Stadium of Light was dogged by controversy and he was axed just six weeks into the season after failing to win any of Sunderland's first five fixtures.
