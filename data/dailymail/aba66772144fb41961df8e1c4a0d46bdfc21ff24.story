Firefighters were called to the Olympic Stadium this morning after a van was reported ablaze.

The London Fire Brigade sent crews to the £500million venue in Stratford, east London, just after 7am when they were called to the scene by security.

However, despite the concern of witnesses that the stadium itself was alight, the fire has now been put out and there were no injuries.

A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: ‘It was a very minor incident. London Fire Brigade attended and the stadium was evacuated. Now everyone is back to work.’

She added that one fire crew was dispatched to the scene, and there was no security alert. Pictures posted on social media had showed thick black smoke billowing above the stadium. 

Sarah Nadif, of Bow, east London, who works in public relations, tweeted: 'Fire in the Olympic Stadium! Fire engines en route. Fire brigade speedy [sic] attend the scene and begin putting it out.'

And economist Adam Rivers said on Twitter: 'The Olympic stadium appears to be on fire. Oh dear', before adding 'No smoke to be seen now. Good.'

On fire: The venue is currently shut and will re-open to the public in 2016 as a football and athletics stadium

The stadium is currently shut and will re-open to the public in 2016, when it will become the new home of West Ham United FC and the National Competition Centre for athletics in Britain.

And West Ham fan Ryan Thompson, of Dagenham, east London, tweeted: 'Looked like the Olympic stadium was on fire from my train... don't burn down before we even get the chance to move in.'
