The Syrian army on Monday lost control of two strategic bases in the northwestern province of Idlib to co-ordinated assaults by Al Qaeda and other Islamist groups, a monitoring group said.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Al-Nusra Front, an Al Qaeda affiliate, seized Hamidiyeh and Wadi al-Deif bases in the biggest regime positions of Idlib in tandem with Islamist rebels from Jund al-Aqsa and Ahrar al-Sham.

The captures came a day after the groups took over seven government checkpoints in the area.

The Al-Nusra Front initially reported a lightning victory in Wadi al-Deif, putting large swathes of Idlib province, which borders Turkey, under jihadist control.

A Twitter account run by the Al-Nusra Front in the north-west province said fighters are removing mines from the area after the 'Wadi Deif camp was liberated'.

The takeover was a show of force for the Al Qaeda branch, which in November drove mainstream rebels seeking President Bashar al-Assad's ouster from Idlib province.

Mainstream opposition fighters had been fighting for Wadi al-Deif and Hamidiyeh for around two years, but despite repeated attempts failed to capture it from government troops.

'The jihadists' advance has major symbolic importance, and it also shows the rebels that Al-Nusra Front really is in control of the area,' said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman.

In its attack on Wadi al-Deif, 'Al-Nusra Front used tanks and other heavy weapons that it captured last month from the (Western-backed) Syrian Revolutionary Front', he told AFP.

Al-Nusra's defeat of the SRF was seen as a blow to U.S. efforts to create and train a moderate rebel force as a counterweight to jihadists of the Islamic State group.

The Observatory said that at least 31 government soldiers and 12 opposition fighters have been killed in the clashes since Sunday. 

Within hours of their Wadi al-Deif victory, Al-Nusra and the two other Islamist rebel groups also took over Hamidiyeh, taking 15 soldiers prisoner, said the Observatory.

'Most of the troops have withdrawn to Hamidiyeh,' said Idlib-based activist Asad Kanjo, adding that a major battle appears to be looming over control of that base.

At least 30 people have been killed in violent clashes as Syrian rebels and the country's army battle over key territory near the city of Aleppo

Ahrar al-Sham had until September tried to distance itself from more hardline jihadists fighting in Syria.

But a September 9 blast killed its entire top leadership, and according to Abdel Rahman, 'this pushed the group to align itself more openly with Al-Nusra. Now the two are fighting side by side.'

On Monday, Ahrar al-Sham broke its silence on the September explosion and accused 'a criminal group' with 'international links', which Abdel Rahman said was an apparent reference to Western intelligence agencies. 

Idlib was among the first provinces to fall out of Syrian government hands, soon after the 2011 outbreak of the armed revolt against Assad's rule.

The latest round of fighting came as European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss ways to help implement a UN plan for a localised cease-fire in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo.

At least 30 people have been killed in violent clashes as Syrian rebels and the country's army battle over key territory near the city.

Nine regime fighters and 21 rebels died in the bloody conflict for Handarat hill on Sunday.

The hill is understood to be a key route used to transport supplies for insurgents who have held control of the east side of the territory since 2012.  

The foreign ministers met informally yesterday with the UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura. 

The UN has been trying to bring about a strategic de-escalation of violence in Syria to permit the delivery of humanitarian aid and set the stage for peace talks.
