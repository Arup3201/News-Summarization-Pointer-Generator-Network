A former police officer accused of being a serial rapist is paraded before a baying crowd of several thousand onlookers.

This is the latest show trial in China, where the mass public courts associated with its hardline regimes of the past have been reinstated.

Ai Kung, 30, was the suspect who was duly convicted as China's Communist Party sought to show its determination to crack down on crime.

The outdoor court, in Hengshan county in western China's Shaanxi province, was fitted with loudspeakers so the audience could hear the evidence against him.

The case was a high profile one in the region in which a series of rapes were carried out against young women by somebody who seemed to plan each attack professionally.

Local media reported that police suspected it was a former soldier, but in the end DNA testing and images from CCTV cameras finally allowed police to identify Kung as the man behind the attacks.

A highly decorated former police officer, Kung had only recently left the force and taken up work as a security guard in a school.

His former colleagues who recognised him at first refused to act saying that they could not believe he was really to blame but images of one of the attacks and the DNA evidence proved a clear-cut case, the court heard.

Prosecutor Chung Liao said that the former officer was a classic Jekyll and Hyde character - by day seeming to be an upholder of the law and at night a sexual predator of the worst sort.

His victims, nine young women aged between 18 and 32, had always been attacked after dark and after being dragged to a remote location they were beaten and sexually assaulted before being robbed and then dumped back on the street.

Public trials used to be a common event in China especially during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, when large groups of people would gather to denounce and punish those accused of betraying the ideals of the Communist Party and taking the 'capitalist road'.

Such events continued to be held in the 1980s and 1990s as the government battled rising crime fuelled by the country’s dramatic economic reforms but then they gradually fell into disfavour and were mostly phased out.

They came back in recently as the country wanted to once again show it was getting tough on terrorist violence mainly linked to militants within the mostly Muslim Uyghur community in the remote north-western region of Xinjiang.

And the feedback has been so positive that it seems the mass public trials of now once again the order of the day, with the practice spreading from terrorists through to more regular criminals including the recent trial against the alleged rapist Ai Kung.
