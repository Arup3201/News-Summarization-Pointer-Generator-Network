The crazed driver who mowed down 11 people last week on Venice Beach and killed an Italian honeymooner was today charged with murder.

Nathan Louis Campbell, 38, was arraigned at the Los Angeles Airport courthouse on 16 counts of assault with a deadly weapon and 17 counts of hit-and-run according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

Prosecutors are expected to ask that Campbell's bail be set at $1.48 million and he faces life in prison if he is convicted.

Charged: Nathan Louis Campbell, 38, with his attorney Philip Dube (R) attend an arraignment hearing in court charging Campbell with murder and assault with a deadly weapon in Los Angeles, California on August 6th, 2013

Campbell was arrested on Sunday after the hit-and-run in Los Angeles.

Alice Gruppioni, 32, the daughter of a 
prominent Italian businessman, was rushed to hospital after the 6pm 
crash on Saturday and died a few hours later with 
her new husband Christian Casadei by her side.

The 2008 Dodge Avenger that Campbell was driving was purchased just a month ago in Colorado. Witnesses say he seemed to deliberately target pedestrians on the Venice Beach boardwalk.

Police records show Campbell has a history of arrests in both Denver and Florida, including an April 2008 reckless driving charge involving alcohol in Panama City Beach.

Later that same year he was arrested in Denver for trespassing and disturbing the peace, the LA Times reports. He also pleaded guilty to shoplifting from a Virgin megastore and spent five years in jail.

A source also told the Times he has a history of drug and alcohol abuse but did not elaborate.

Authorities still do not know the motive of the hit-and-run. He is expected to appear in court today.

Alice's husband Christian Casadei spoke about his heartbreak yesterday.

'We were walking, we were happy, we were on our honeymoon and everything, and suddenly everything changed,' Casadei said, according to Giuseppe Perrone, the Italian consul general in Los Angeles, who accompanied Casadei to the hospital.

'I still can't believe it, and I don't even remember exactly what happened. It's all very confusing.'

Perrone described Casadei as 'destroyed and in disbelief' and her relatives are reportedly calling her death a tremendous injustice.

Wedding Day: Alice Gruppion died after being hit by a driver who deliberately smashed onto the
 Venice Beach boardwalk on Saturday as she and her new husband strolled down the popular boardwalk

Married just two weeks ago, Gruppioni
 and Casadei were in California for their honeymoon, which was a trip 
across the United States.

'It's a tragedy. There's nothing more to say,' Casadei told the Italian news agency ANSA.

One
 of the 11 people injured by the driver is in critical condition 
and two others are seriously injured, according to officials.

The 
remaining eight sustained at least minor injuries and a four-year-old 
child is among the injured, according to reports.

'It's tragic the fact that somebody, whether accidental or intentional, 
would come on the boardwalk, where hundreds, thousands of people come 
here to enjoy the beach,' said LAPD Lt. Andy Neiman.

'There no indication that he knew anybody that he hit,' LAPD Cmdr. Andy 
Smith said to CNN.

'It looks like this guy wanted to run over a bunch of 
people. One guy bent on doing evil.'

Describing the car as in control despite going as fast as 60mph, one witness told KCAL that 'the driver was out for blood'.

Witnesses said the car drove 
'purposefully down the boardwalk', leaving a trail of injured people and
 shocked beach-goers in its aftermath.

boardwalk as the sun sank, surveying the idyllic scene for several 
minutes before getting back into the car and speeding into the crowd.

It
 shows hundreds of people walking lazily or sitting at cafes before the 
black car suddenly appears and sends them scrambling wildly.

According
 to surveillance footage and witness accounts, Campbell
swerved around yellow poles there to stop cars from getting onto the 
pedestrian-only boardwalk.

He fled the scene and about 
an hour later.

Just as police were circulating word they were 
seeking a black Dodge Avenger with a driver in his 20s, Campbell walked into a 
police station in neighboring Santa Monica, told officers he was 
involved in the boardwalk incident, Neiman said.

One of those injured, 
Mustafa Balci, was sitting in a lawn chair next to his wife at their 
booth on the Venice Beach boardwalk, enjoying the leisurely summer 
scene. Minutes later, their booth was struck by the car.

It
 swerved left, sideswiping a picnic table holding the couple's wares - 
the traditional Turkish blue glassware of the eye to ward off the evil 
eye, and wall hangings of Jesus and Virgin Mary tapestries.

The
 car hit three customers looking at the items, and slammed into Balci's 
knees pushing him backward, breaking a table, smashing a mirror and 
scattering everything.

His wife, Yesim Balci, was flung 8 feet, tumbling backward and landing facedown.

'I couldn't see her when I woke up, I looked up and was like where is she? I yelled, "Are you around?

Are you alive?" She yelled back, "I'm alive",' Mustafa Balci said.

Firefighters and paramedics treat some of the injured at the scene of last Saturday's incident

Right on the beach: The pedestrians were hit right near 1 Dudley Avenue, in Venice Beach, CA

'I thought both of us would be dead.'

Balci,
 44, was helped up by strangers who took him over to his wife. The 
couple were taken along with three others to Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, treated for minor injuries and released.

Only the beginning: Fire officials can be seen setting up the mats where they would treat the injured

Yesim
 Balci, 48, had her ankle taped up, blood seeping through the back, and 
bruises all over her body. On Sunday, she couldn't raise her left arm.

Another witness described the horrific scene from his vantage-point down the boardwalk.

'I
 was half a mile from the scene, but you could see just this mass of 
people trying to get out of the way ... just a lot of people screaming,'
 runner Daniel Rigedor told the Los Angeles Times.

'I saw somebody flying up in the air… when I came upon the scene, there
 were a bunch of people on the ground, bloodied,' he said. 'Some looked 
pretty mangled, head injuries, just a lot of blood.'

'He was trying to kill everyone,' said witness Walter Estrada, 42, who works as a vendor on the boardwalk,'It happened so fast, I was trying to protect myself.'

Witnesses described the horrific premeditated hit-and-run as like a scene out of a horror film.

'It
 was horrible. I mean it was like something out of a movie, something 
you would never expect to see. There were people flying, laying on the 
ground, tents flying everywhere,' said Katherine Blackburn to KABC TV.

'If he wanted to kill people, he came on a perfect time, 5 p.m. on a Saturday in the summer in Venice Beach.'

Witness Louisa Hodge said victims could be seen wandering around in a daze, dripping with blood.

'There
 was people kind of stumbling around, blood dripping down their legs 
looking confused not knowing what had happened, people screaming,' said 
Hodge, who was out enjoying the day on the Venice Beach boardwalk with a
 friend visiting from San Diego.

'It was blocks and blocks of people just strewn across the sidewalk.'
