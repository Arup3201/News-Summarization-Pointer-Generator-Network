Alicia Blagg and Rebecca Gallantree won England's second gold of the opening day of the Commonwealth Games diving competition by stealing first place on their final dive.

After Jack Laugher won gold in the men's 1m springboard event in Edinburgh, Blagg and Gallantree followed suit in the women's synchronised 3m springboard.

It took England's medal tally at the Royal Commonwealth Pool - which also hosted Commonwealth Games events in 1970 and 1986 - to three from three events.

England's Sarah Barrow and Tonia Couch claimed silver in the women's synchronised 10m platform on Wednesday afternoon. 

Blagg and Gallantree scored a high of 72.54 for their fifth and final dive - a forward 3 1/2 somersault - to take gold with a total of 300.24.

Canada's Jennifer Abel and Pamela Ware (295.65) claimed silver and bronze went to Australia's Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith (294.72).

The English success comes before Tom Daley has taken to the boards.

Daley's competition begins on Friday with the men's synchronised 10m platform before the individual event he won in Delhi in 2010 takes place on Saturday.

For Blagg and Gallantree it was an unexpected triumph, with both enduring injury-plagued 2014 seasons to date.

'I just can't believe it,' Blagg said.

'That last dive it was either a medal or no medal. We had no idea. We thought we were in fourth or fifth.

'To do that dive and then see the scoreboard ranked first it was the best moment of my life. Just disbelief.'

Gallantree added: 'We knew we could do a good one (last dive). We have been struggling with it a little bit in training; the timing's been a bit off.

'We've worked really hard on it over the last couple of days.

'To do it in that situation, last dive, when it really mattered, and to do that to get the gold is just amazing.'
