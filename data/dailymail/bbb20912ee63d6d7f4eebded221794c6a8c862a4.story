While Surrey were being beaten by Durham in their One-Day Cup group match, Kevin Pietersen was relaxing on the beach with his family.

The former England international has been playing for Surrey on a game-by-game basis, but he was not present as they lost  by five wickets at Chester-Le-Street.

Pietersen was spotted with his wife Jessica Taylor, and their son in Miami

Contract: The former England international has been playing for Surrey on a game-by-game basis

The 34-year-old has not played for Surrey since the beginning of the month in their T20 Blast quarter-final win over Worcestershire.

And, worryingly for Surrey, they have failed to win all four of their one-day matches since then. Pietersen will return to the side later this month in the T20 Blast Finals Day on August 23 at Edgbaston.

Surrey face a possible semi-final against Warwickshire and then the South African born cricketer could face his old club Hampshire in the final.

Holiday: The last game ke played was T20 Blast quarter-final win over Worcestershire earlier this month

Crucial: Since Kevin Pietersen last played, Surrey have failed to win any of their four one-day matches

Return: Pietersen will play in T20 Blast finals day on August 23 at Edgbaston

One-Day: Durham's Scott Borthwick is bowled out by Surrey's Tillakaratne Dilshan in their One-Day Cup match
