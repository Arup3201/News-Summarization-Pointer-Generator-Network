Wrestling to rip-off those fiendishly sticky paper airline luggage tags after every flight could soon become a thing of the past.

British Airways is trialling personalised reusable electronic bag tags this month that do away with the need for a new paper version for each flight.

Each time you fly, the electronic barcode on the tag changes - giving the latest up-to-date personal information, destination and 
flight details.

A passenger checks in to a flight using the official British Airways smartphone app.

The app is then held over the electronic bag tag and the flight details, destination and personal details of the passenger are sent wirelessly using NFC technology.

NFC stands for near-field communication and can transfer data from one device to another simply by touching the devices together.

A written summary is also shown so passengers can check everything is correct.

The electronic screens 'fix' the image
 onto the tag for the duration of the trip – allowing it to be scanned 
electronically when going through luggage handling at departure, onto 
the plane, and through to the luggage collection carousel in the 
arrivals.

The details stay on the tag until the customer checks onto a new flight.

The battery turns off once the image is 'fixed' so it can be used on long haul flights.

The tag lasts around five years.

The tags can be used by passengers who have their booking details sent to their smartphone using the official British Airways app.

Each tag carries a special computer chip and has two small screens on each side.

At check-in, passengers can hold the smartphone carrying their booking details over the tag.

The phone then transmits these details wirelessly to the tag, which displays them on the screens in the form of a barcode.

The barcode is then changed and updated for that new service.

BA said the tags can be used 'time and time again' with a different barcode generated for each new flight.

The tag's battery switches off once the image is ‘fixed’ and BA said a tag will last around five years.

A BA spokesman said: 'Once checked in, customers just need to hold their smartphone over the electronic tag, which automatically updates with a unique barcode containing their flight details and an easy-to-see view of their bag’s destination.'

Dispensing with the requirement for a traditional paper tag to be printed and attached for every flight will be quicker and more efficient says BA: 'It means customers save precious time by having their electronic tag quickly scanned at the bag drop, going straight through security to relax before catching their flight.’

British Airways’ managing director for customers Frank van der Post said: 'This is a fantastically simple, yet smart device that gives each customer the choice to have their own personalised electronic baggage tag that changes with the swipe of a smartphone – every time they fly.

The electronic tags have been specially developed by British Airways in partnership with Densitron Displays and Windsor-based Designworks. Heathrow Airport is providing help with the trials last this month

'As the saying goes, 'good things come in small packages', and this innovative device is no exception.

'Along with other initiatives we are investing in, we believe it has the potential to revolutionise the way our customers check in and pass through every airport around the world in the future.’

Development of the personalised electronic bag tag is part of wider plans to improve the flow of customers through the airport, making it quicker, smoother and easier.

BA has also held major trials on self-service bag drops, automated boarding gates, porter services, auto check-in, and 'meet and greet' hosts.

Heathrow Airport is providing help with the trials that are sent to take place later this month.

BA said that over the next five years it is investing more than £5billion in new aircraft, smarter cabins, elegant lounges, and new technologies to make life 'more comfortable in the air and on the ground.'

Earlier this week BA took delivery of its first new Airbus A380 'superjumbo.'

Glenn Morgan, British Airways’ head of service said: 'Our customers are at the heart of everything we do and our drive to innovate with this new electronic bag tag is a brilliant example of how we can help transform their travelling experience.'

He added: 'We've harnessed expertise from across the airline to produce a solution for speedier checking-in, which at one swipe shows British Airways can be a game changer when it comes to customer service.'

British Airways took delivery of the new double-decker 'superjumbo' Airbus A380 this week. The airline's bosses say the plane will herald 'a new era' for the nation's flagship airline
