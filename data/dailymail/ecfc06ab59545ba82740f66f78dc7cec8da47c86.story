A swarm of bees caused a Brazilian football match to be delayed after settling on a goal crossbar.

The match, between Ponte Preta and Atletico Sorocaba, was cast into doubt after the bees gathered together at the Moisés Lucarelli stadium in Sao Paulo.

Firemen were called in to kill the bees, delaying the league game by 15 minutes.

The amusing footage shows two men in white coats using a ladder to climb up before blasting the bees 
with the fire extinguishers.

Petrol was then applied to cleanse the area before the game kicked off.

It was worth the wait for Ponte Preta, however, as they recorded a 2-1 victory with goals from Cleber and Willian.

Last May a Ryman Isthmian Football League Division One South match between Whyteleafe and Hythe Town had to be called off after the referee was stung by a bee in the 31st minute and collapsed.
