Injured midfielder James McCarthy will be monitored after being left out of the Republic of Ireland squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany because of injury.

The Everton man, who has become a key member of manager Martin O'Neill's team, missed the Europa League clash with Krasnodar on Thursday night with a thigh problem, and his condition will be assessed ahead of the double-header in Dublin and Gelsenkirchen.

McCarthy is one of 10 players, all of whom will either be monitored or remain on stand-by, left out after being named in an initial 37-man squad.
