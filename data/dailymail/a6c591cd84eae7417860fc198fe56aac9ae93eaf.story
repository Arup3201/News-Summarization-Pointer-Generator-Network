Teams often make wholesale changes for the FA Cup and Chelsea were no exception with eight. 

But Hull - who fell in a 2-0 loss against Arsenal - topped the Premier League teams with 10 changes from their previous starting XI.

Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side saw eight changes following their 5-3 Premier League defeat to London rivals Tottenham on New Year's Day, as they cruised to a 3-0 victory over Championship outfit Watford.

6 - Cardiff, Nottm Forest, Blackburn, Sunderland, Ipswich, Man City, Man Utd 

5 - Preston, Luton, Brentford, Millwall, C Palace, Sheff Utd, A Villa, Arsenal 

4 - Bristol C, Norwich, Wolves, Brighton, Bolton, West Brom, Rochdale, Wrexham, Sheff Wed

Manchester United and neighbours Manchester City both won after making six changes apiece to their previous starting XI's, although City boss Manuel Pellegrini was most critical of his players as he saw them come back from a goal down against Sheffield Wednesday thanks to two James Milner strikes.

Pellegrini said: 'Yes I am relieved because we didn't play well.' 

Ronald Koeman altered just two of his Southampton players as Ipswich forced their top-tier opponents to an FA Cup replay.

Bringing in Shane Long and goalscorer on the day Morgan Schneiderlin to replace Toby Alderweireld and Sadio Mane in the clash at St Mary's, the Tractor Boys held the Saints to a 1-1 draw to book themselves a rematch at Portman Road.
