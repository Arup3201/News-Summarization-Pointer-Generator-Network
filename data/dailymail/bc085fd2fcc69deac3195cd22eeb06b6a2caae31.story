The extent to which the Premier League overshadows English football’s ruling body will be demonstrated when the FA publish their annual accounts.

The figures for the year ending July 2014 put the FA’s turnover at £332million, with a gross profit of £261m. These are big numbers and compare favourably with the RFU, who turned over £152.2m during the same period.

But they are dwarfed by the £5.1billion the Premier League gained for their domestic TV rights over three years, with more billions to come from overseas deals.

The FA will have to change general secretary Alex Horne's review, after he wrote about the signing of a sponsor for the 2014-15 FA Cup, which never happened

Sky Sports paid the Premier League an average of £11.1m per game — the same amount the FA brought in from their combined annual increase in broadcasting, sponsorship and licensing.

Meanwhile, the FA will have to alter former general secretary Alex Horne’s review, written last November, contained in the accounts. He wrote about the signing of a sponsor for the 2014-15 FA Cup which never happened.

Horne also singled out Sian Massey as a leading match official ‘setting a global standard’. She was at the women’s Under 20 World Cup but hasn’t been an assistant referee for a PL game this season — first because of injury and now because she is pregnant.

More evidence that UEFA are orchestrating the three-strong presidential challenge to Sepp Blatter came with their strategist Mike Lee’s Vero Communications helping to launch Luis Figo’s campaign in London this week. 

The same company also helped Jordan’s Prince Ali bin al Hussein of Jordan launch his candidature on the same ‘Anybody But Blatter’ ticket a fortnight ago.

The ECB have set a dangerous precedent by allowing struggling England one-day captain Eoin Morgan to play in the whole of the Indian Premier League. 

His £156,000 deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad means he will miss the one-day international against Ireland on May 8 when he would have been due to lead the side — form permitting — and that means England will need to pick another skipper, devaluing the position.

It’s still questionable business as usual at FIFA with the extraordinary early sale of the 2026 World Cup TV rights to Fox in the USA without a tender — to the fury of ESPN and other rival networks. 

The USA are favourites to host that tournament and delaying selling the rights until the location is decided could have brought in far more money. But Fox have been the biggest opponents of the switch to a winter World Cup in Qatar and this deal will ensure they don’t take legal action.

Judo thrown into chaos

Former Manchester City chief executive Garry Cook, now chief global brand officer of mixed martial arts’ Ultimate Fighting Championship, engineered £250,000 in sponsorship for the British Judo Association’s hosting of the European Championship in Glasgow in April.

However, the European Judo Union, led by Russian Sergey Soloveychik, have cancelled the event at short notice in protest at the partnership.

Cook said: ‘It’s outrageous to do this with just eight weeks to go and after so much planning had gone into staging the event in Glasgow. If they didn’t want our money then cancel the sponsorship rather than the Championship.’

The patrons of Twickenham’s west car park, including long-standing debenture holders, have been further antagonised by the RFU’s commercial obsession. 

This has seen the Bollinger champagne facility moved a short distance to new premises, further marginalising the dwindling space left for west car park users to enjoy food and drink from their own car boots. 

They include Bill Beaumont, chairman of the RFU management committee, and Ian Metcalfe, chairman of the Professional Game Board. But making money comes first at Twickenham.

One of Paul Lambert’s last acts as Aston Villa manager was to recommend the appointment of Scottish Herald football reporter Thomas Jordan as the new communications chief at Villa Park. Unfortunately, Jordan’s first day in the job coincided with the arrival of new manager Tim Sherwood.
