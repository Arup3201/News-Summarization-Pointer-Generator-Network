She's well-known for her virtuous lifestyle and despite following a healthy diet, working out five days a week and building a successful brand for herself, Millie Mackintosh is determined to better herself.

The 25-year-old is kicking off the New Year with a new set of goals and resolutions - and she's shared them with her fans. 

The health aficionado has teamed up with feelunique.com to share her five golden steps to a 'new Millie'.

Millie Mackintosh, 25, is kicking off the New Year with a new set of goals and resolutions, including meditating more, having regular facials and using technology less 

Her first resolution is to drink at least two litres of water every day so that her skin stays hydrated. 

She also vows to start having regular facials to keep her skin in 'tip top condition' and try a new gym class that she's always been too scared to try before.

She's also going to clear her mind and stay focused using her Headspace meditation app every day and complement her new regime by spending less time on her phone.

The fashion designer and beauty blogger has certainly started the year as she means to go on, by embarking on a gruelling two-day alkaline cleanse.

Millie is clearly keen to head into 2015 with a more focused mindset - and wants to be even healthier

Millie explains that the cleanse will 'ease her into a happy, healthy January after five days of eating mainly fried food in New York', where she was holidaying with husband Professor Green.

Millie is following Tanya's Maher's New Year Alkaline Cleanse, which claims to be a detoxifying cleanse to alkalise your body after the festive season.

'This is not just another juice cleanse or a raw food detox. After coaching hundreds of clients on boosting their pH levels, I designed a cleanse which is both juicy and raw and guaranteed to purify your body, skin and energy,' said Tanya, who has a raw food cafe in Chelsea that Millie regularly frequents. 

The £120 package is formulated to provide Millie with plenty of fibre to scrub out her insides, probiotics to increase her intestinal movement, chlorophyll to boost her pH levels from acid to alkaline, electrolytes to hydrate and calcium to nourish.

The package apparently cleanses and nourishes in one and by combining juices, soups and high-fibre snacks, it wont leave Millie feeling deprived, says Tanya.

Millie claims she'd been overindulging on her romantic break with her beau in New York. The pair returned home this week and no doubt Millie is getting set to focus on her burgeoning brand.

Speaking to MailOnline recently, Millie revealed that she is considering venturing into beauty. 'I love discovering the next big thing in beauty and I am definitely looking into it but I'm so busy at the moment.

'It would be a range of make-up combined with skincare,' she added.

And if that wasn't enough, Millie is currently penning her lifestyle book, full of the healthy recipes she loves, on the side. 'I'm having to remember to write down the method and ingredients as when I cook I normally throw meals together. It's exciting I'm trying to write a bit each day.' 

The ambitious young star already has big plans for the future.

She said: 'It would be amazing to see my clothing line go on and expand over the next few years, I'm working on the summer collection now. Maybe I will do sportswear at some point in the future.

'In five years time, I would love to be a mum and maybe have added a cosmetics line to my brand. I'm really happy with how things are going at the moment.'
