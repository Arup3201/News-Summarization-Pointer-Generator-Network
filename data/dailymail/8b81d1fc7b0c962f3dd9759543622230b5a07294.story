BBC newsreader George Alagiah has been diagnosed with bowel cancer.

He will be off air for the near future while he receives treatment, the BBC said today.

The 58-year-old, who has been a familiar figure on TV news bulletins for many years, is said to be 'optimistic' about a positive outcome.

The Sri Lanka-born journalist has been the face of BBC1’s News at Six since 2007. He was made an OBE in 2008's New Year Honours.

In a statement the BBC said: 'He is grateful for all the good wishes he has received thus far and is optimistic for a positive outcome.

'George asks that he and his family are given the space and privacy they require whilst he recovers.

'Our thoughts are with him and his family and we send them our very best wishes during this time.

'Until such time as George is well enough to return to work the BBC News at Six and GMT on BBC World News will be presented as usual by familiar faces from BBC News.'

Mr Alagiah first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003, but he stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host Natasha Kaplinsky.

He has been married to his wife, Frances Robathan, for 30 years and has two sons, Adam and Matthew.

He was educated at St John's College, an independent Catholic boarding school in Portsmouth.

He went on to read politics at Durham University's Van Mildert College.

He has previously been a prominent 
foreign correspondent, often as a specialist in Africa with coverage of 
civil wars in Somalia and Liberia, as well as the genocide in Rwanda 20 
years ago.

Mr Alagiah 
joined the BBC 25 years ago after working as a print journalist and he 
has gone on to write a number of books including A Home From Home, which
 looked at what it means to be British.

He has also presented other 
shows such as Mixed Britannia, looking at the UK’s mixed-race 
population.

Bowel
 cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men, behind prostate 
and lung, with almost three-quarters of cases affecting people over the 
age of 65.

In
 response to the news, Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the charity 
Beating Bowel Cancer, said: 'We’re sorry to hear that George Alagiah has
 been diagnosed with bowel cancer. We wish him all the best with his 
treatment and recovery.

'Almost 41,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK, that’s one person every 30 minutes.

'However, bowel cancer is very treatable when caught in the early stages when over 90% of cases can be successfully treated.'

The news of his diagnosis came as researchers found that one in three of us has a gene that can more than double the odds of developing bowel cancer – and the more processed meat you eat, the higher the risk.

Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer. If diagnosed in its earliest stages, the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent and a complete cure is usually possible, according to NHS statistics.

Processed meat products have  long been blamed for increasing the odds of the disease, with some studies finding that eating as little as one sausage a day can lead to tumours.

But this latest research is the first to find a gene that links diet with the disease. In the future, people’s DNA could be tested for rogue genes – and then given a diet to keep tumours at bay.

In the largest study of its kind, University of Southern California researchers pooled ten previous studies to compare the DNA of more than 9,000 people with bowel cancer and a similar number without the disease.

The results, published in the journal PLOS Genetics, showed that around one in three of us has the rogue gene, according to researcher Jane Figueiredo. Genes come in pairs, and those who have one flawed gene and eat the most processed meat are almost twice as likely to develop bowel cancer as those who have healthy DNA.

Having two rogue genes means the risk is increased 2.7 times. It isn’t clear how these foods interact with the gene to increase the odds of the bowel cancer, but it may be because they tamper with the immune system.

Mark Flannagan, of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ‘There is strong scientific evidence that red and processed meats can increase your risk of bowel cancer.

‘This study reinforces the message that it’s important to reduce the amount of red and processed meats that we eat.

‘We recommend that eating less than 500g (1.1lb) of red meat a week and avoiding processed meats as much as possible.’

The study’s co-researcher Dr Li Hsu said: ‘The possibility that genetic variants may modify an individual’s risk for disease based on diet has not been thoroughly investigated but represents an important new insight into disease development.’
