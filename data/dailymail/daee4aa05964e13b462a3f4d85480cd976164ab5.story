Hate preacher Abu Hamza is demanding that he is moved to a softer prison hospital for care

Hook-handed hate preacher Abu Hamza has demanded to be moved from a US top-security jail because officials have refused his request for a bidet in his cell.

The terror suspect claims he is not being kept in the conditions that were agreed as part of his extradition from the UK.

Hamza, who lost both hands and an eye fighting the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s, had his metal hook taken away by prison officials in  New York when he arrived there in October last year.

The Muslim cleric’s plea for a bidet  to be installed in his cell was refused, with a judge retorting that jail ‘is  not a hotel’.

Now Hamza, born Mustafa Mostafa in Egypt 55 years ago, claims the stumps of his arms have become infected.

His lawyers say he can only get the proper medical treatment he needs at a specialist facility and want him moved from the Metropolitan Correction Centre in Lower Manhattan, where he is being held to await trial next year.

Lawyer Lindsay Lewis said: ‘The United Kingdom was promised that Mr Mostafa would be provided a certain level of accommodation as a condition of his extradition to the United States.’

She told a federal judge in New York that he needs treatment at a medical centre for his infected stumps. Miss Lewis requested a transfer to the Devens Prison Medical Centre in Massachusetts – where surviving Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was treated for injuries received during a shootout earlier this year.

Hamza was extradited to the US after 
waging an eight-year battle that is estimated to have cost UK taxpayers 
more than £2million.

He 
was wanted in America on suspicion of participating in hostage-taking in
 Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an 
Australian.

Hamza is 
also charged with providing material support to the Al Qaeda network by 
trying to set up a training camp in Oregon and attempting to organise 
support for the Taliban in Afghanistan.

His
 taxpayer-funded lawyers tried to block the extradition on health 
grounds, claiming Hamza would be held in inhumane conditions.

After
 a British court approved the extradition, Hamza appealed to the 
European Court of Human Rights, which delayed his removal until October 
2012.

Hamza used to use a metal hook on his right hand but US prison authorities confiscated it, saying it was a security risk.

His
 lawyers complained that this meant he could take food only through a 
straw and as a compromise a special prosthetic hand was made that was a 
cross between a spoon and fork. The lawyers also requested the bidet in 
his cell.

When they complained to the court about his treatment, District Judge Katherine Forrest told Hamza that jail ‘is not a hotel’.

The cleric is due to stand trial in April and faces life imprisonment if convicted.

Hamza’s
 hate-filled sermons in London earned him such notoriety that French 
spies were said to have hatched a plot to assassinate or kidnap him amid
 fears he would incite Algerian terrorists to attack the 1998 World Cup 
in France.

A report from
 an anti-extremist think-tank said that French secret service agents 
would have posed  as members of the far-Right extremist group Combat 18 
to carry out the plan.

The
 report’s author Nick Lowles, a respected and long-standing campaigner, 
wrote: ‘Angered by the inaction of Special Branch and MI5 in the UK, 
there was serious talk of [the French] taking matters into their own 
hands.

‘He would be nabbed on the street, forced into the back of a van and then driven to Dover and snuck on to a French ferry.

‘It
 is also known that a team of assassins from Draco, a DGSE [French 
external security directorate] unit, was considering taking out senior 
terrorists.’
