This is the horrifying moment a man was left blinded in one eye after being beaten with his own belt by a gang of thugs. 

The 32-year-old Bensalaman Ismai was attacked at around 6am on January 26 last year after becoming embroiled in a dispute over a taxi in Birmingham city centre.

After trying to run away, he was chased down and punched, kicked and hit in the face with the buckle of his belt, causing him to lose vision in one of his eyes.

The men have been jailed for the attack which took place last January during a late-night fight over taxis

Simeon Evans, 30, and Jack Gargham, 26, were jailed for four years for the 'savage' attack, while Sophie Sheldon, 20, who is seen punching him in the face, was given a suspended sentence of two years.

The violence came after their victim became involved in an argument with Evans over a taxi.

He is seen running away but is chased down by Evans who snatches the belt out of his hand and begins whipping his face and body. 

Gargham then joined in the attack, kicking Mr Ismai while he writhes on the ground to the horror of by-standers.

Sheldon is later seen running towards the group, punching him several times in the face.

Mr Ismai has had two operations since the attack, but has permanently lost sight in his left eye as a result of the brutality.

'The amount of mindless violence that was inflicted was totally over the top and was definitely fuelled by alcohol,' said  Detective Constable Chris Smith of West Midlands Police. 

'The victim has had to go through an extensive amount of medical treatment including surgery.

'After an initial operation on his eye he needed further surgery and in March was told that he had lost the sight in his left eye permanently.

'He is still coming to terms with his injuries and has told me that he feels his live is over, and there’s no opportunity left to him.

'We accept yesterday’s decision and hope that the jail sentence brings some comfort to the victim.'

Sophie Sheldon posted this photograph on social media after being released from court without a custodial sentence (left). The 20-year-old was given a two year suspended sentence and a six-month curfew 

After being handed her sentence, the 20-year-old posted this photograph of her posing outside court
