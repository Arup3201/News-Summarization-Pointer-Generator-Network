A man dressed as a clown bearing a striking resemblance to the notorious film monster Pennywise is spooking residents by posing late at night around a town and waving at passers-by.

The figure has been spotted in full clown attire around Northampton - and one woman claimed he offered to paint her windowsills after knocking on her front door, despite having no equipment on him.

There is no explanation for the appearances by the clown - who bears a striking resemblance to the demonic character played by British actor Tim Curry in the 1990 horror film Stephen King’s It.

The clown appears to have even set up a
 Facebook page, which now has more than 26,000 likes. He writes comments
 under pictures of himself, signed off with Pennywise’s catchphrase - ‘beep,
 beep’.

Since his first 
appearance last week - on Friday 13 September – he has sparked a raft of
 speculation among locals who fear he may be up to no good. Others have 
even threatened to attack him. 

But
the clown said on his Facebook page: ‘Too much hate, not enough love. No, I 
don't have a knife on me. That’s just stupid rumours spread by stupid 
people.

‘I'm also “not” on Twitter as it confuses the heck out of me. However, I might go for a jog
 around that pond in Abington Park later as I'm really unfit. See you 
around. Beep, beep!’

The clown has been spotted in several 
areas in the town, including in a shopping district at 11pm. He has also
 been snapped clutching a set of juggling clubs and even colourful 
balloons in one picture.

In a caption to the shopping district 
photograph, he wrote: ‘Beep, beep! Didn’t think I'd be seen tonight. 
Extremely quiet but there were a few of you who saw. See you all 
around.’

Mysterious Facebook post by clown

Some Facebook users with 
coulrophobia - an abnormal fear of clowns - have pleaded with him to 
stop. Others said they are ‘freaked out’.

Kelly Keen said: ‘You’ve been spotted - now get out of the clown suit and start acting like a grown-up that you supposedly are.

'Stop scaring people as some people do have real fears of clowns and you are terrorising them, despite what you may say.'

And
 Korey Brown wrote: ‘I would probably mug you or seriously hurt you. No 
hard feelings bro(ther), but I’ve always wanted to hurt a clown.’

Posing: Since his first appearance last week - on Friday 13 September - he has sparked a raft of speculation among locals who fear he may be up to no good. Others have even threatened to attack him

However, others praised him for 
creating a talking point among locals. Jay Gould said: ‘Poor clown - 
just trying to liven up Northampton, and people threatening to hurt 
him.’

'We can confirm that we have neither arrested nor dealt with any crimes involving anyone dressed as a clown'

Northamptonshire Police spokesman

Northamptonshire 
Police confirmed today that they had received calls from members of the 
public reporting three clown-related sightings over the weekend.

However,
the force said no crimes had been reported involving people dressed as 
clowns or any arrests been made in connection with the clown sightings.

A spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that we have neither arrested nor dealt with any crimes involving anyone dressed as a clown. However, we received three calls over the weekend relating to people being seen dressed as clowns.’

Whereabouts: The clown has been spotted in several locations, including in a shopping district at 11pm. He has also been snapped clutching a set of juggling clubs and even colourful balloons in one picture

Mother-of-three Felicity McDonald, 45, who lives in Northampton, said: ‘It's the only thing anybody has been talking about in the entire town today.

'He'd better be careful around a town like this. If you go about dressed as a killer clown, it can only end in tears'

Felicity McDonald, Northampton mother

‘Some people are really going too far, saying we need to stop him because they are so freaked out by it all. It is a little bit weird and everyone is just expecting it to be something sinister.

‘It’s like Stephen King's It has come to life. He’d better be careful though around a town like this. If you go about dressed as a killer clown, it can only end in tears.’

Meanwhile, some social network users reported sightings of a vigilante 'Clown Catcher'.

Twitter user Samantha Phillips uploaded a picture of a bald man sporting sunglasses and a Superman-style costume, with the caption: ‘Northampton now has a clown catcher too.’
