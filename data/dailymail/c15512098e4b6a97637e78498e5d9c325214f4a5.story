A footballer was left with a horrific injury after his chin was ripped apart by a 'bladed' stud on an opponent's boot.

Gary Fawcett, 30, was attempting to stand up after a tackle when another player 'ran over' his face.

He suffered a 6cm-long gash which cut down to his jaw bone and needed 13 internal and 17 external stitches.

Gary Fawcett was left needing 13 internal and 17 external stitches after his face was ripped open by a bladed football boot during a match

The 30-year-old was playing for Garstang FC, against Eagley in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in the amateur West Lancashire Football League when the incident happened

Mr Fawcett, an agricultural fitter, said: 'The blade caught me on the chin and just sliced down.

'It wasn't too painful at the time. When you're playing football, your blood is pumping and the adrenaline is going.

'I ran into the changing room straight away though - I knew something was up. My friend drove me back to Preston so I could be closer to home.

'In the car it really started hurting. Blood was pouring out. We had a gauze from the medical kit which I was using to hold it together.'

The incident happened last Saturday as Mr Fawcett captained his team, Garstang FC, against Eagley in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in the amateur West Lancashire Football League.

Mr Fawcett, of Preston, Lancashire, had scored a goal and assisted another when he was struck down 40 minutes into the match.

The player did not realise the seriousness of the injury at first and held the gash together with an instrument from a first aid kit, but he was later taken to hospital

He says he does not blame the opponent as insists the injury was accidental and not caused maliciously.

After being taken off the pitch he was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital, where he needed three injections in both the top and bottom of the cut before the stitches.

'The stitches took a good two hours,' he said. 'I wanted him [the surgeon] to take his time. He's done a really good job but it was taking so long that the anaesthesia was starting to wear off.

'My girlfriend had joined me at the hospital but she couldn't watch the stitches. It was quite horrible.'

Mr Fawcett now faces an 18-month wait to find out if he will be permanently scarred. His team went on to draw 3-3.

Bladed studs were the brainchild of ex-Liverpool player Craig Johnston, who called then 'Traxion' soles and said they allowed players to run faster.

He convinced sports firm Adidas to take up the idea, which they incorporated into their iconic 'Predator' boots, which sold by the thousands after their launch in 1994.

The boots were promoted by footballers David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane and rugby player Jonny Wilkinson, making them hugely popular amongst youngsters.

But Johnston later warned football boot firms that the blades were becoming 'lethal weapons' due to their development using different materials.

His fears have since been proved right with a series of injuries.

In 2001, Sunderland youth team goalkeeper Craig Turns needed 33 stitches after a bladed boot sliced open his face and, the following year, Burnley striker Andy Payton was forced to retired after needing 38 stitches in his leg.

After then-Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane broke his foot in 2005, the team's then-manager Alex Ferguson called for blades to be banned.

The most famous injury said to have been caused by the studs came in 2012, when Wayne Rooney needed 10 stitches after being caught by Fulham's Hugo Rodallega. The same player then needed stitches in his head last year after receiving a cut to the forehead in training.

Bladed boots were championed by, among others, David Beckham but following a spate of injuries have since faced claims they are dangerous
