A collection of bizarre Victorian inventions that never quite made it past the prototype stage have been revealed in a new book.

It was the incredible era when Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb, George Stephenson was busy with his first steam engine and engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship.

But the display, which has been held at the National Archives in Kew, Richmond, for 150 years, reveals not every idea in the 'age of invention' would change the world.

The inventions found range from the wacky to the baffling, such as a cravat to protect against garrotting and an air-conditioned top hat. There are even a set of saucy corsets with expandable busts.

 The idea of hiding a coin purse in a glove (pictured) was one of the Victorian-era that failed to change the world

Inventors also proposed artificial leeches to drain blood for medical treatment (pictured) and a flying machine for the Arctic that pre-dates the first airship by more than 40 years

The idea of hiding a coin purse in gloves never caught on nor did a mechanical 'jack' for automatically pulling off boots.

A device to save people from drowning, complete with rowing-style paddles and miniature floating buoys, never made it into production. And a mangle-like hair brushing machine also failed to make the cut.

There was even a design for a walking stick cane gun like the one used by actor Robbie Coltrane in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough.

A design for a corset with an expandable bust, invented by F.Parsons in 1881. It works by inflating the cups with a tube to make the breasts appear larger 

The Bonafide Ventilating Hat, invented by John Fuller & Co. in 1849, was designed to stop gentlemen's heads overheating while wearing top hats, a big problem at the time

The discovery of the plans was made by Julie Halls, Records Specialist for Registered Designs at the institution in Kew, south London, gathering dust.

She has now turned the designs she found that spanned from 1839 to 1991 into the book 'Inventions That Didn't Change The World'.

Julie said of the book in an interview with publisher Thames & Hudson: 'These designs came in a culture where inventors were viewed as national heroes.

'There was very much a culture of 'can do' and teaching yourself and being self-reliant and a fascination with the way things worked.

Artificial leeches, thought up by one of the Victorian inventors who thought they were great minds of the time

A design for a gold digger's dwelling was one of the late 1800s wacky inventions which was drawn up put never put into production

Designs reflected things that were possibly needed at the time like this one for an 'Invalid's Exercising Chair', invented by Robert Kerry, in 1852 

'Today, you would expect new designs that come to the market to have been made by professional engineers or designers.

'But in those days people would just invent things associated with their own profession and try and get them to the market.

'It was amazing to discover them especially when only a few very determined researchers had actually seen them before.

'The book is an opportunity for the public to see them for the very first time.'

When Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb in 1879 and George Stephenson was busy with his first steam engine, hundreds of wannabe inventors wanted their shot at glory.

A design for an Anti - Garotting Cravat, invented by Walter Thornhill in 1862 - the same year an MP was the victim of a robbery by garrotting

Plans for a universal reservoir inkstand, created in Birmingham, have been gathering dust for 150 years

A design for a 'jack' for putting on and pulling off boots, invented by, Edward Fox, in 1846. It features in the new book complied from the National Archives

The Desideratum Combined Knife and Fork, invented by, Messrs Arnold and Son in 1881 was designed with the intentions that people would be able to eat with one hand

A design for a spring bible and prayer case which was registered for Thomas Brindley of Finsbury 

Author Julie, who has worked at the Archives for five years, insists everyone was trying to create the next big thing more than 150 years ago.

She says the 1843 Utility Designs Act was the turning point because the Act gave copyright protection to the new elements of 'useful' designs.

Before that only 'ornamental' plans like ceramics, wallpapers, and textiles were covered by the Act.

Julie said: 'A lot of the designs seem completely bizarre until you know the social history behind them. Though you do have to wonder how many lives would have been saved by the anti-garrotting cravat.'

Inventions that Didn't Change the World is available to buy on Amazon. 

This figure shows the design for a 'breast reliever', which was invented by Alexander Robertson, in 1849. It never made it into production and collected dust elsewhere
