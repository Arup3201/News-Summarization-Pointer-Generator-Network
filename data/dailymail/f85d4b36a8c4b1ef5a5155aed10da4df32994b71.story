The heartbroken mother of a teenage girl who died after inhaling a compressed air product meant to clean dusty keyboards has shared details of her tragic death in an attempt to discourage others.

Lori Barchers from Kansas, Missouri, said her daughter, Hope, 17 began dabbling in drugs by the age of 13 and although it started off as experiment it soon spiraled out of control.

Barchers told KMBC-TV:  [She started using] drugs, in general at about 13. The duster didn't come until she was 17.'

Sadness: Lori Barchers said her daughter, Hope, 17 began dabbling in drugs by the age of 13

Death: Hope Barchers died after using a can of compressed air for dusting keyboards to get high

Availability: The household product is widely available at grocery stores and is a PC keyboard cleaner

She recalls how her daughter would use a can of compressed air for dusting keyboards  to get high.

And she warned her that if she continued to do it, she'd die.

Her sister Hailey heard the duster go off one day as Hope inhaled it.

Sadly, she was later found dead in her bedroom with a can of computer duster in her purse next to her. 

The household product which is widely available at grocery stores has an ingredient called difluoroethane which is used by drug users to get high.

Hailey said she now misses her sister because they 'were best friends.'

Loss: Her sister Hailey, left, heard the duster go off as Hope inhaled it and later died 

However while the night of fun that cost Hope her life has sent a warning message to Hailey many other teenagers continue to participate in the huffing craze. 

Hailey said: 'I went off on them about it.[I told them] you know that's going to kill you. If drugs aren't enough for you, don't resort to that. Get some help. You could lose your life because of it.'
