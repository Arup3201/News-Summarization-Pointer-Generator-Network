A transplant surgeon at a leading hospital has saved his mother's life by donating one of his own kidneys.

It is thought to be the first time in the world that a transplant doctor has donated an organ.

Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself.

He stepped forward when told his 64-year-old mother Dilshad, who had been on dialysis for five years, might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney.

Family affair: Transplant surgeon Dr Asim Syed (right) saved his mother Dilshad's life by donating one of his own kidneys for a procedure at Hammersmith Hospital in London where he works

The worried surgeon brought her to London from her home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, to be cared for at his hospital.

Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother and two other patients on whom he had recently operated.

Mrs Syed said: 'When I came round 
from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said 
was: "Mum now all your worries are over".'

Other members of the family were either not a correct match for Mrs Syed or were not fit enough to donate.

However,
 it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood 
group, so the only way for him to donate directly was for his mother to
 go through a special blood-washing process to remove antibodies that 
would reject his kidney.

He
 consulted colleagues about blood-washing, but they were reluctant to 
use the method because the risk of rejection is still too high.

Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired or pooled donation.

This is where would-be donors who are not a correct match can find a correct match through an anonymous donor chain.

Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother.

The chain of three transplants - 
involving three donors and three  recipients from three transplant 
centres - took place simultaneously on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney 
going to a recipient in the Midlands and  Mrs Syed receiving her kidney 
from a person in the south of England.

Now mother and son are recovering well
 with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs Syed is staying with him for 
several months while the hospital monitors her progress.

He said: 'I did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering but it wasn't as straightforward as we had hoped.

'A pooled donation was the only way of guaranteeing mum would get a transplant quickly.

'Although I wasn't able to help mum directly, by agreeing to be part of a  chain you all help each other. By volunteering in such a way we took three people off dialysis.'

Mrs Syed said: 'Because Asim was a transplant surgeon he recognised how ill I was becoming.

'He whisked me down to London to be seen by his colleagues. They  stabilised me so that I was fit enough for a transplant. Until I met the team at the Hammersmith no one had mentioned a pooled donation.

'I'm not sure I'd have got a transplant if it hadn't been for Asim being in transplants. He knew exactly what was needed.'

Dr Syed's father Azmat, 69, who has been a GP in Doncaster for 36 years, said: 'We were reluctant for Asim to donate because he is young, but his sister and older members of the family weren't suitable for donation.

'My wife really needed a transplant and Asim was aware that being on  dialysis is not a bed of roses. It's far from ideal and a lot of patients find leading a normal life quite difficult.'

Dr Syed Jr said: 'People think that once you are on dialysis your life is not at risk. When I looked at the statistics I was quite shocked.

'Only 30 per cent of dialysis patients survive to five years and at ten years only ten per cent are alive.

'Being on dialysis is not good for the body because not all the toxins are  removed and because people are not dialysed often enough.

'Patients only go on dialysis three times a week in hospital because there are not enough machines. Ideally patients should dialyse every day or five or six times a week.'

Dr Syed's boss, Professor Nadey Hakim, performed both transplants.

He said: 'What a magnificent gesture. Asim knows how vital it is to get more live donors. When his mum needed help he knew what he had to do.'
