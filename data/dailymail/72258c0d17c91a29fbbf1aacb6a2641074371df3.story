A talented designer has come up with a real 'floating palace' that is sure to catch the eye of superyacht owners.

Lujac Desautel's SALT concept is very much a luxury item. But it is no celebrity-style motoryacht; it is a 180ft yacht, complete with two masts and huge sails.

The living quarters resemble a glass box, offering stunning views 24/7 and the glass area can be folded away so as to open up the yacht and take in the sea air. There are also steps that can be folded down into the sea giving you your very own swimming pool.

The downstairs area resembled more like a pool-side lounging section, with easy access for a quick dip in the sea

Included on board is a dining area that can cater for 12 people, a cocktail bar and even an interior garden. There is one master cabin, two VIP cabins and two twin-bed residences.

The yacht is a progression from Desautel's GLASS structure which was inspired by skyscrapers and Lego and resembles a gleaming block rising from the sea.

Instead, this sailing yacht is a somewhat more dreamy offering.

'The world is a laboratory of ideas that can be borrowed,' Desautel writes on his website.

'Certain typologies can evolve because they have adoptive features. SALT could be thought of as an evolution of these preconceived ideas.'

For any crew employed there are also four twin-bed cabins in a separate part of the yacht. 

On his website Desautel describes how he believes 'great design offers an authentic beauty that invites people to consider experiencing the world in a different way; perhaps a way they never imagined.' 

Desautel was last year nominated for Young Designer of the Year by Boat International Media and is a Bachelor of Architecture Student at California College of the Arts in the US. 

Although the ideas are only at the 'design' stage, it is hoped the innovative and futuristic superyacht may well be just what one millionaire is after.

Benjamin Maltby, Principal Consultant at MatrixLloyd – the worldwide authority on superyacht purchase and construction – gave MailOnline Travel his views on the SALT concept.

'I really like many of SALT's features. Sure, it's been created by a young designer – and this shows – but with a little further investment it could be turned into a glorious, ground-breaking vessel.

'The great thing about superyachts is that no planning permission is needed to build one – there are just some common sense safety regulations to be met. So buyers can make a floating space that's truly a reflection of their personalities and aspirations.

'I love the water-yacht interfaces. For years, too many designers viewed superyachts as floating houses. It took a long time for the ‘beach club’ concept to be accepted (this is where hinged parts of the hull fold outwards to create platforms down by the water’s edge) – now they’re de rigueur for engine-driven superyachts. 

'SALT’s beach club at the back is an idea that’s not been tried as yet, but it’d be great as it offers a shady area that’s also surrounded by water on three sides. 

'The steps on the side are wonderful, but some thought would be needed as how and where they would be stored when not in use as weight on a sailing superyacht must always be carried as centrally and low as possible to counteract the action of the wind on those sails.'
