Cleveland Cavaliers fans rioted in anger the last time LeBron James was a free agent, and decided to leave the Ohio team to join the Miami Heat. This time around, they hope the basketball MVP will come home.

Optimistic Cavs fans have started to gather outside James' Akron, Ohio house, as they await his decision which is expected to be announced tonight. James is allegedly deciding between staying with the Heat or rejoining the Cavs.

However, if the decision is announced tonight, it likely won't happen in Ohio. Sources told ESPN that James' does not plan to fly to Ohio at any point on Thursday.Â  Instead, he'll fly straight from a basketball camp in Las Vegas to Brazil to attend Sunday's World Cup final, the Akron Beacon Journal reports.

Waiting for word: Cleveland Cavaliers fans have begun to gather outside LeBron James' Ohio home in hopes of celebrating his return to the team later tonight

Nevertheless, security has been amped up around James' Bath Township mansion.

Local Police Chief Michael McNeeley told Fox 8 that James hires off-duty policemen to work security outside his property every day, but that more officers will be present today and tonight when the decision is expected.

Security has been letting fans drive by James' home, but they are not letting them stop in front of it.

Rumors were that James was to announce his decision via his website at 3:30pm on Thursday, but that hour came and went with no announcement and even caused the site to crash.

The last time James was a free agent was in 2010, when he decided to leave the Cavs and join the Miami Heat.

Fans then rioted in anger, starting fires in the street to burn LeBron jerseys, posters and other paraphernalia.

Despite joining the Heat, James kept his home in Ohio.

James and his agent Rich Paul reportedly met with Miami Heat President Pat Riley in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

Sources told ESPN that James needs to discuss the decision with his family before making any announcement.
