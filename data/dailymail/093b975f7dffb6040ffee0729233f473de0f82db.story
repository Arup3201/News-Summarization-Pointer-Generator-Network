Veteran British actress Jacqueline Bisset won the award for the most excruciating acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in LA on Sunday night.

The star delivered a cringe-worthy TV moment after being named Best Supporting Actress in a TV Show, Miniseries or TV Movie for her BBC drama Dancing on the Edge.

She beat out rivals Janet McTeer (White Queen), Hayden Panettiere (Nashville), Monica Potter (Parenthood) and Sofia Vergara (Modern Family) for the gong.

Cringe: Jacqueline Bisset won the award for the most excruciating acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in LA on Sunday

When she first appeared on stage she was speechless for what seemed an age, before spluttering into a weird stream of consciousness ramble.

'I'm stunned,' she said, and went on to leave the audience and viewers rather gobsmacked too by her ramblings. 

In a car crash speech that was punctuated by long pauses, she swore and said she wanted to thank those who had given her 'pleasure and sh*t'.

Shock: Bisset seemed genuinely surprised to win which may account for the strange incoherent speech

Tears: The actress was off her game from the beginning of the speech that started with a few tears

'Bonkers' Bisset's incoherent speech sent the Twitterverse into a spin

The reaction on Twitter was swift and merciless, with some branding it 'bonkers' and the 'maddest acceptance speech in awards history'.

Ellen DeGeneres quipped: 'I helped write Jacqueline Bisset's speech. Did you like it?'

British TV writer Boyd Hilton wrote: 'Really hoping Bisset is still on stage silently staring when the show resumes after this ad break #GoldenGlobes'

'Bissett had such a long walk to the stage she dropped her marbles on the way. #GoldenGlobes,' Jack Guinness quipped mercilessly.

Kate Walsh couldn't stand to watch and admitted: 'I ❤️Jacqueline bissett but I had to leave the room.'

She won it: Jacqueline displayed her trophy for Dancing On The Edge

Gamut of emotions: Bisset was thrown by the win and her speech never came together

She's got it together: Bisset was altogether more composed as she showed off her trophy backstage

'Oh sh**!' Elisabeth Moss made a blooper when she accepted her Best Actress in a Mini Series award

Piers Morgan chipped in to brand Bisset 'bonkers' and added: 'Maddest acceptance speech in awards history. Take a bow, Ms Bisset. #GoldenGlobes'

Meanwhile Estelle wrote: 'Random
 words. Random words. Paragraphs. Tips for life. Words of wisdom. Thank 
you so much. Yeah. Lol #JacquelineBisset #thebestspeechsofar.

Elisabeth Moss also had a slight stumble as she took the stage to accept her Best Actress gong for Top of the Lake, overcome with similar shock she exclaimed: 'Oh sh**!'

Wolf of Wall Street stars Jonah Hill 
and Margot Robbie got thrown off kilter when the wrong script ran on the
 prompter at the Golden Globes, Hilll pointed the error out and Robbie 
laughed.

Luckily, they managed to save proceedings by checking their piece of paper.

Awkward moment: Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie had to turn to an old-fashioned piece of paper after an autocue error

Making fun: Emma Thompson sent up awards show disasters by arriving on stage with shoes in one hand and a martini in the other

Emma Thompson parodied a stage disaster by arriving on stage with her heels in hand and a martini in another to present the Best Screenplay gong to Spike Jonze for Her.

She threw her heels over one shoulder to present the cult favourite with his trophy for the Siri-based love story.

Thompson, who looked stunning in gold, was obviously following P Diddy's advice that it'll be fine and over soon, as long as people 'keep drinking' as featured in this hilarious vine https://vine.co/v/hLKtWMIY3u3.

Somebody who could probably have done with a stiff drink after he presented Best Actress to Cate Blanchett for Blue Jasmine, was Leo DiCaprio.

Floored by Poehler and Fey's encouragement that the crowd should give him a warm welcome 'just like a supermodel's vagina' he pronounced Steve Coogan's Philomena as Phil-O-Mania, which drew a laugh at the Hilton and immediately started trending on Twitter.

The 71st annual Golden Globes are airing live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, with hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
