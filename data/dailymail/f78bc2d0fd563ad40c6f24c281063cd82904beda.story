'One was taller than the others,' remembers 74-year-old New Yorker, Marita Lorenz. 'I asked him who he was. He laughed and said, "Yo soy Cuba. Commandante Fidel Castro."'

It was the first time Lorenz clapped eyes on the Cuban dictator but it certainly wasn't the last. Just one year after the first fateful meeting, Lorenz was living in Havana as his mistress.

But her presence there didn't go unnoticed, not least by the CIA, who in 1960 recruited her to kill Castro using poison pills concealed in her face cream.

So how did Lorenz, the daughter of a German American cruise liner captain, go to from lover to would-be killer in such a short space of time?

Her story began on the 28th February 1959 when her father's cruise ship, the MS Berlin, on which she also worked, dropped anchor in Havana harbour.

As liner dropped anchor, a launch crammed with uniformed men hurtled towards them, among them, fatefully, Castro.

'He was 33, with sparkling eyes,' she remembers, speaking in an interview recorded for History Channel documentary, CIA Declassified. 'And that was it. I was lost in love.'

On her return to New York a few days later, she found herself bombarded with calls and invitations to return to Cuba from the dictator.

She obliged and, within days, was installed in Castro's penthouse apartment on the 74th floor of the Havana Hilton.

After her affair with Castro ended, she went on to have a child with Venezuela's Marcos Pérez Jiménez

Two months later, she discovered - to her delight - that she was pregnant. But her happiness wasn't to last.

Drinking a glass of milk one day while heavily pregnant, she suddenly blacked out and came to a few hours later to find herself seriously ill - and without her baby.

So ill did she become, she was flown home to New York for treatment. Once there, she was visited by the CIA who revealed that Castro had arranged for her to be given a late term abortion.

'I didn't believe it,' she told the Radio Times. 'But they did a good job of brainwashing me, telling me that he did this to me. It left me heartbroken.'

So heartbroken, she was willing to believe agents when they informed her that Castro was not just a threat to America, but intimidatingly dangerous as well.

Lorenz remembers: 'They said, "we want you to take him out".'

She agreed and in January 1960, she travelled to Miami to meet Frank Sturgis; a CIA double-agent who handed her a pot of poison pills.

Her role was simple: drop one in Castro's drink and escape unscathed. Frightened she would be discovered by Cuban customs, Lorenz resorted to one more subterfuge and hid the pills inside her pot of cold cream.

It was a decision that would prove fateful. Back once more in Castro's Havana penthouse, she attempted to slip the pills into a glass of water but was foiled by the clinging cream.

'I tried to wipe it off, but I couldn't,' she remembers. 'I panicked and tried to flush them down the loo but they wouldn't go down. Then Fidel walked in.'

The dictator had got wind of the plot and Lorenz was terrified. 'He took his gun out of its holster,' she says.

'I thought he was going to shoot me, but he gave me the gun and asked, "Did you come to kill me?"

'Then he took a puff on his cigar and closed his eyes. He made himself vulnerable because he knew I couldn't do it. He still loved me and I still loved him.'

And he was right. Lorenz ejected the bullets and fell into his arms. But her incredible story still wasn't over.

Fearing the CIA would kill her if she attempted to remain with Castro, she returned to Miami and never saw her erstwhile lover again.

Although she would later have an affair with another dictator, Venezuela's Marcos Pérez Jiménez with whom she had a daughter, and another relationship that resulted in a son, Lorenz' affection for Castro, now 87, remains undiminished.

'The moment I saw the outline of the island from the plane, I knew I couldn't do it,' she says. 'I have a reputation as an assassin but wouldn't kill a bug.'
