The driver of this car raised eyebrows when he left his Toyota Yaris perched on a kerb two feet above the road.

The vehicle, driven by an elderly man, was considered to be so dangerous that police had to close the road.

Julian Road, near the junction with Lansdown Road in Bath, Somerset, was closed to other traffic while officers were safe-guarding the car.

Extraordinary: Passers-by were left wondering this morning how the car got on to the kerb and left hanging above the double yellow lines in Bath City Centre

Road closed: the Toyota Yaris hangs precariously above the double yellow lines in Julian Road in Bath, Somerset this morning. Emergency services were waiting for recovery teams to remove the car

The driver, however, was nowhere to be seen.

Although it looked as though it would tip down onto the winding street below any moment, the the driver obviously thought it was stable enough to leave there.

The unusual parking was spotted by IT worker Toby Willmott as he made his way to work in Bath. He said: 'I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this.

'I don't know how someone was able to 
even drive their car into such a position, let alone manage to get out 
of it while leaving it like that.

Hanging in there: passers-by were scratching their heads as to how the driver managed to park his Toyota while officers closed off Julian Road to remove the car

'They might have a problem moving it off again though - especially if the traffic warden gets hold of them.'

Meanwhile, in Glasgow, Scotland, last week this taxi driver fared no better. He was taken to hospital with minor injuries after he careered into the street side gap on Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street next to Kelvingrove Park.
