Australia's ice breaker vessel the Aurora Australis has arrived in Antarctica to collect a seriously ill explorer who sparked an emergency evacuation.

The man fell ill just one day after the vessel departed the base on Tuesday with a fast-deteriorating illness, but the nature of his medical condition has remained undisclosed.

The man will be taken aboard, while the ship's fuel tank will be topped up at Davis station over the next 48 hours to embark on a voyage of about two weeks back to Hobart.

Emergency efforts to evacuate a seriously ill man from Antarctic Davis station were hampered by sea ice

Emergency efforts to evacuate the man were hampered by poor weather conditions and increasing amounts of ice.

The Australian Antarctic Division's Operations Manager Robb Clifton said he hopes the ship can begin its journey back to Hobart on Monday.

Favourable weather conditions are forecast, which would allow the ship to depart.

The expeditioner remains in a stable condition and is receiving ongoing treatment for his undisclosed illness from the station doctor.

The man will be taken aboard while the ship will top up on fuel at Davis station over the next 48 hours

The Australian Antarctic Division said only that the man's condition had stabilised and is not contagious, but that he needs to go to Hobart for further treatment.

The man arrived in Antarctica in November and had been due to spend the winter at the base. The patient and his family have asked for privacy, Division boss Tony Fleming said.
