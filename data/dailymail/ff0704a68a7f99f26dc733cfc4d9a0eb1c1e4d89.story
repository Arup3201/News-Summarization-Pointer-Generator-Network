England new boy Nathaniel Clyne looked at home as the Southampton defender trained for the first time with the England first team on Tuesday morning.

Clyne's fine start to the campaign with Southampton was rewarded last week by a first call-up to the senior side and the youngster was all smiles as he limbered up alongside England vice-captain Gary Cahill and Kieran Gibbs. 

Wayne Rooney led the way as the Manchester United striker looks to get some game time following his three-match Premier League ban after seeing red during his side's 2-1 win against West Ham last month.

Only Fabian Delph was missing from Roy Hodgson's 21-man England squad as the players trained at St. George's Park after lining up to show their support for England's official FA charity partner Breast Cancer Care.

Delph picked up a knock playing for Aston Villa at the weekend, but is expected to be fit as England prepare for their first Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino on Thursday.

Clyne has yet to make his England debut but the right-back is already targeting a regular role in Roy Hodgson's starting line-up.

He said recently: 'I need to go there and the training sessions and show what I am about and hopefully I will get my chance and start for England.'

'The aim is to take step by step but I am not here for fun and games. I am here to nail my colours to the mast and hopefully I will take that right-back position and make it my own.'

Hodgson has also called Arsenal defender Calum Chambers up to the England squad after John Stones withdrew because of an ankle injury he suffered in Everton's 2-1 defeat at Manchester United.

Stones is set for a spell on the sidelines because of suspected ankle ligament damage, which occurred in the dying minutes of Sunday's game at Old Trafford. 

The Football Association (FA) confirmed on Sunday night that Chambers has been drafted into the senior squad from the Under-21s to replace the former Barnsley defender.

A statement from the FA read: 'Following John Stones' injury this afternoon the player will not report to St George's Park for England duty tomorrow (Monday).

'England manager Roy Hodgson has subsequently called up Calum Chambers, who was previously due to report for the Under 21s team.'
