They may be from rival countries in South America but Gus Poyet and Mauricio Pochettino both showed real solidarity and respect to each other during their sides' meeting at the Stadium of Light.

The Sunderland and Tottenham manager are from Uruguay and Argentina respectively but that rivalry was put to one side on Saturday, with Poyet paying particular close attention to his counterpart.

Poyet planted a kiss on Pochettino's cheek prior to the thrilling 2-2 draw between the sides, but this isn't the first time the Uruguayan has done this to the former Southampton boss.

History repeated itself at the Stadium of Light as Gus Poyet showed real compassion towards Mauricio Pochettino yet again 

When Sunderland entertained Southampton last night Poyet went in for the kill well and truly as he looked to give Pochettino a peck on the lips.

As well as this Poyet showed his consoling side to Pochettino at the final whistle on Saturday too, giving him a hug after the game with Harry Kane's fortuitous own goal earning Sunderland a share of the spoils.

Following the draw Sunderland find themselves in 13th place with three points from their opening four games, with Spurs sat in sixth place with seven points.
