Golfers at a course in
Florida on Wednesday were careful to putt around a large
alligator, days after the beast was photographed lounging on the
edge of the green.

A women's tournament went on as planned at the Myakka Pines
Golf Club in Englewood, on Florida's west coast, as the gator,
estimated at 12 to 13 feet long reposed in
full view of about 100 participants, said Mickie Zada, the
club's general manager.

'If we stopped playing because of alligators, we'd never
have golfers,' Zada said.

One recent gator is believed to be about 13 feet long and can been seen frequently wandering around the holes and napping on the putting greens

Zada said she had spent much of Wednesday morning fielding
calls from reporters asking whether the photo, taken by a golfer
on Friday, was doctored to make the alligator appear larger.

'This gentleman is well into his 80s. He wouldn't even know
Photoshop,' Zada said.

And according to the club, the alligator is far from
the first - or even the biggest - to show up on the course.

A 15-footer, nicknamed Big George, hung around for years until his death, Zada said.

Despite nearly daily alligator sightings at the course, none have attacked a person in the club's 37 years

Despite nearly daily alligator sightings at the course, none
have attacked a person in the club's 37 years, Zada said, owing
in part to a strict policy against feeding the animals.

Dangerous confrontations between humans and alligators
usually stem from people feeding them, Florida wildlife
officials have said.

The new alligator has yet to be given a moniker, but that
may soon change, Zada said.

'We might name him Viral,' she said.
