New Zealand easily chased down 105 to complete an eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and make it five Test-match victories in a year for the first time.

Captain Brendon McCullum became the first New Zealander to hit 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year when he made a rapid 195 in the first innings in Christchurch.

But he was not needed in the second as Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor knocked off the runs required once opening pair Tom Latham and Hamish Rutherford had been dismissed.

That put the hosts 1-0 up in the two-match series to complete a remarkable year for the side and particularly McCullum, who hit 302 and 224 against India in February and 202 against Pakistan in Sharjah last month. 

With his century in Christchurch coming in 74 balls, he beat his own record for the fastest Test ton by a Kiwi. He was close to smashing the record for the fastest double ton by any player when he was caught trying to hit his 134th ball for six.

West Indies are toiling in the first Test against South Africa in Port Elizabeth after losing seven wickets for only 44 runs. They are 275 for nine in their first innings at the end of the fourth day, still 142 runs behind — despite Kraigg Brathwaite and Marlon Samuels both hitting centuries. 

Morne Morkel had four for 69 when play was ended by rain, which could prove to be the Windies’ saviour.

At the end of day four in Melbourne Australia moved 326 runs ahead of India, with three wickets remaining in their second innings. Chris Rogers scored 69 and Shaun Marsh was unbeaten on 62.
