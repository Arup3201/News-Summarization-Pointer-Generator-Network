Patients should receive healthcare statements every year telling them how much they have cost the NHS in a bid to clamp down on time-wasters, a report says.

The ‘bill’ would list the number of times they had visited their GP, A&E and outpatient clinics over the past 12 months and, where possible, the cost of these services.

It could compare their usage to the average patient in their local area – highlighting to frequent visitors where they might be using services unnecessarily.

Costs: Patients should receive healthcare statements every year telling them how much they have cost the NHS in a bid to clamp down on time-wasters, a report says

The study, released by the Centre for Policy Studies, said the statements would help patients ‘understand the costs’ and encourage them not to misuse the NHS by missing appointments or visiting casualty departments when it was not required.

The report, How Much Do We Use the NHS, co-authored by Tory MP Jesse Norman, said the estimated annual cost of unnecessary or missed appointments was £1billion.

It said the healthcare statements would be ‘simple and transparent’ and had the ‘potential to save the NHS hundreds of millions of pounds every year by encouraging users to change their behaviour and to take greater personal responsibility’.

However, the statements would not be used as an attempt to introduce the public to private healthcare, the authors said, insisting that ‘political and public opposition to charging for NHS services remains strong’.

It is estimated that the cost of a GP appointment ranges from between £10 and £25, while attendance at A&E is more than £100 a visit and more in the case of admission to hospital.

But many of appointments could be avoided, it is claimed.

According to PharmaTimes, 51million people every year visit their GP with minor problems which would clear up by themselves or through use of an over-the counter remedy.

'Awareness': The report,  co-authored by Tory MP Jesse Norman, said the estimated annual cost of unnecessary or missed appointments was £1billion

These include as many as 40,000 GP visits a year for dandruff, 20,000 for travel sickness and 5.2million for blocked noses.

The report, which was co-written by Museji Takolia, chairman of the Wye Valley NHS Trust, said: ‘As with an annual bank, ISA or pension statement, each individual user of the NHS would receive a Healthcare Statement every year.

‘The user would be able to see what services they had received over the past 12 months and the cost of those services to the NHS.

‘Where the same or similar service could be provided less expensively – say by visiting their GP rather than A&E – they might also be able to see the savings to be made.’

The statements could include the number of visits to a hospital or GP practice, the basic cost of these services, the number of missed appointments and the cost of this to the NHS and information highlighting potentially unnecessary visits.

Mr Norman, a member of the Treasury Select Committee and MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, said any costs of collating data across different health bodies and posting out the statements would be out-weighed by the savings made.

He said the ‘tax’ statements meant patients would see themselves more as customers rather than recipients, making them aware of the true cost of the services of doctors and nurses.

He said: ‘This is not a matter of charging people. This is about raising awareness of where people are not using the NHS effectively.

‘For example, if they are repeatedly visiting their A&E department where they could be getting exactly service at a lower cost by visiting their GP.

‘Or where people are repeatedly missing appointments.

‘The bill might say you have visited your GP seven times, missed three appointments and been to A&E four times in a year.

‘Your doctor could ask you to bring in your healthcare statement to see how many times you have visited different services and discuss this.

‘If people are frequent users or unnecessary users, they would be able to see a pattern of behaviour.’

The report suggested that the scheme would have to undergo thorough trials before being rolled out nationwide.

It added: ‘In addition in end-of-life contexts special care will have to be taken to prevent patients from seeing themselves as burdens on their families or on the NHS if cost information is included.’
