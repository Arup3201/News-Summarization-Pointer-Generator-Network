Passenger aircraft will fly in formation like birds in the latter half of this century, according to a radical new vision of the future of flight by one of the world's leading aircraft manufacturers.

European firm Airbus says formation flying could become a reality on high-frequency routes under their vision for flying from 2050 and beyond.

The company also envisages planes climbing more steeply from take-off and gliding in to land to reduce noise and emissions.

Airbus added that by the middle of 
the 21st century flights in Europe and the USA could on average be 
around 13 minutes shorter, saving around nine million tonnes of fuel a 
year.

And highly-intelligent aircraft would be able to 'self-organise' selecting the most efficient and environmentally-friendly routes.

The shorter flights would lead to the 
saving of more than 28 million tonnes of avoidable C02 emissions a year 
as well as the saving of five million flying hours.

Airbus
 engineering executive vice president Charles Champion said: 'Our 
engineers are continuously encouraged to think widely and come up with 
‘disruptive’ ideas which will assist our industry in meeting the 2050 
targets we have signed up to.

'These
 and the other tough environmental targets will only be met by a 
combination of investment in smarter aircraft design and optimising the 
environment in which the aircraft operates.

'That is why our latest Future by 
Airbus Smarter Skies concepts focus on not just what we fly, but how we 
may fly in 2050 and beyond.'
