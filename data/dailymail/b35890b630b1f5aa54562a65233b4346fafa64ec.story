A former MasterChef contestant accused of embezzling over $7 million from his own mining company to fund 'a high-class lifestyle for himself and his girlfriends' has had the claims against him dropped in a private settlement.

In April, a lawsuit claimed New York-based Australian playboy Aaron Thomas used company many for private jets, a luxury yacht and a $171,000 Tiffany engagement ring for his Brazilian fiancée.

Thomas, 26, was sacked as CEO of London-based Oakmont Trading Ltd earlier this year after the board accused him of squandering millions of company money to fund his extravagant lifestyle, according to the lawsuit filed by the company in the Manhattan Supreme Court.

On Thursday, it emerged the case against Thomas - who appeared in the first season of the Channel 10 reality-cooking show in 2009 - had been listed as 'discontinued with prejudice' by the court.

Thomas' lawyer Rob Garson told The New York Post the accused was satisfied that the 'vexatious and baseless allegations' had been dismissed.

Thomas founded the mining company, which owns and operates a Brazilian iron ore mine, in 2010 and then proceeded to sell 74 percent of the company’s stock to investors, the suit stated.

Thomas reportedly paid $14,500 a month for a Manhattan apartment where he lived with his fiancée Thaiana Rodrigues.

The company launched legal action in both the UK and the US to recover an estimated $7m of company money.

'While Thomas has made some disclosures as to the whereabouts of the misappropriated funds, a sum of around [$2.5 million] remains unaccounted for,' the suit stated.

The lawsuit featured numerous claims of Thomas' decadent spending, reports the New York Post. He is alleged to have spent $91,000 of company funds on a trip to Las Vegas in May 2013.

Another $121,500 was apparently spent on designer watches by Rolex, and Hubot, and he even paid for 'many other flights taken by Thomas's girlfriends, including Rodrigues, in 2012 and 2013,' the suit claimed.

Thomas said the lawsuit was an attempt by the board to get his remaining shares.

As part of the recent confidential settlement, the 25 per cent stake in Oakmont which Thomas owned was sold back to the company.
