Europe’s Justin Rose was unhappy about the number of mobile phones being used by supporters on the opening day of the Ryder Cup.

Rose felt the use of handheld devices by a high proportion of the crowd at Gleneagles was a distraction - although he stressed it was only a minor irritation on what had been a successful day.

The 34-year-old, in tandem with Henrik Stenson, registered two points for Europe with victories in the fourballs and foursomes.

Rose said: 'I thought the crowd were really, really good today, apart from phones.

'I’ve got to say, cameras and phones were pretty poor out there for what I would class as a very knowledgeable golf crowd.

'That was the only (thing), but maybe (it is the) Ryder Cup, maybe not as educated a golf crowd as a normal, Open Championship crowd, for example.

'But otherwise it’s been a phenomenal day start to finish.'

Mobile phones are permitted on the course but regulations state that mobile phone cameras cannot be used.

Unauthorised use can result in confiscation, until leaving the site, but this regulation is practically very difficult for marshals to enforce given the high number of spectators.

Calls can only be made in designated areas and devices must be switched to silent.

Crowds of around 45,000 were anticipated on course each day while there were 1,500 marshals and 600 police.
