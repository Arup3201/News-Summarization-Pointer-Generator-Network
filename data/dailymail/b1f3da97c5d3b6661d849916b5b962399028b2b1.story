Desperate villagers who have been cut off from the rest of the country by floods for more than three weeks have received help from a floating bridge.

The pontoon has been set up along a country road linking the village of Muchelney to the rest of Somserset.

The bridge allows villagers to walk part of the journey to dry land, which must still be completed by boat. Muchelney has been inaccessible by land since 2 January, and some parts of the surrounding countryside are 5 feet underwater.

Link: The structure will shorten the boat journey between the stranded village and the surrounding land

Deep trouble: The waters around the Somerset village are five feet deep in places

The situation, which has seen villagers rely on volunteer rescue boats for essential supplies, has been declared a 'major incident' in light of forecasts of even more rainfall this weekend.

Muchelney, which lies between Taunton and Yeovil, was also devastated last year by the worst floods for decades.

A vital boat service operated by Somerset County Council, which is ferrying people to work and school, as well as shipping in supplies, is continuing as the access roads are still flooded.

Images of the flooded road shows cars completely submerged, while villagers can be seen canoeing between their homes and the 'mainland'.

The floods which have hit Muchelney 
have been described as the worst in a century, though the village - the 
name of which means 'Big Island' in Saxon - is often cut off by high 
waters.

The Environment
 Agency does not have any severe flood warnings - meaning a risk to life
 - in force in Somerset but there are several flood warnings in place.

Help: Boat services such as these are the only means of bringing supplies to the village

Flooded: The country road, now a waterway, would usually be surrounding by tall vegetation

Supplies: Parts of the roads are shallow enough to be traversed on foot, left, or by tractor, right, but the villagers of Muchelney are currently reliant on boat services

Damage: Muchelney villager Nick Studley has seen his home ravaged by high waters over the past weeks

Dozens of pumps have been deployed in an attempt to ease the flooding, but an Environment Agency spokesman said it could be weeks before the water is fully removed.

The Met Office has issued an amber warning of rain for Somerset with 10mm to 20mm forecast.

'With water levels already 
exceptionally high on the Somerset Levels, the public should be prepared
 for further flooding,' a Met Office spokesman said.

Kerry
 Rickards, chief executive of Sedgemoor District Council, said: 'Several
 Sedgemoor communities have been severely affected by the floodwaters 
for some weeks now.

'With significant rainfall expected over the coming days we feel this situation needs to be escalated as a major incident.

'Sedgemoor
 District Council would like to extend its continued sympathy for the 
residents, business owners and farmers affected by flooding.'

Sunk: The waters surrounding the village are deep enough to cover cars

No respite: The village often floods, and the Environment Agency says it could be weeks before the water subsides

Coping: Villager Elizabeth Nightingale assesses the damage to her home. The village has been inaccessible by land since 2 January

Help: Somerset County Council has extended a boat service to move people at supplies to and from Muchelney

The council said it would continue to provide practical support to residents whose properties are flooded or are predicted to flood.

This ranges from the supply of portable toilets where septic tanks are overwhelmed to sandbag collection points in villages and deliveries to the most vulnerable properties.

The council said it had provided around 3,000 sandbags in the past few weeks and is also offering housing advice and is on standby to provide temporary accommodation.

Somerset County Council is campaigning for the dredging of rivers on the Levels and has recently pledged a further Â£500,000 towards the cost - a move backed by Sedgemoor District Council.
