Hillary Rodham Clinton may be the Democratic Party's presidential front-runner, but the former secretary of state's poll numbers don't make her look the part.

Her 'favorable' rating – a measure of how many Americans see her in a positive light – is now 'under water,' meaning that she has fewer fans than detractors.

A CBS News poll released Thursday found that just 26 per cent see her favorably, compared with 37 per cent who don't. 

The rest, about one-third of those polled, haven't made up their minds.

UNDER WATER: Clinton's 'positive' poll numbers now trail her 'negatives' by 11 percentage points

READY TO REBOUND? Clinton's favorability numbers are only a few points higher today than when they hit an all-time low, according to a CBS poll – right after her memoir 'Hard Choices' hit bookshelves

Unsurprisingly, Clinton's 'unfavorable' numbers are high among Republicans, registering 78 per cent.

Barely half of Democrats, though – just 55 per cent – say they hold favorable views of her. 

That number is down 8 points since November 2013. Across the entire voting spectrum, Clinton has lost 12 points of support in the intervening 16 months.

Her high-water mark in the CBS poll came just two months after she took over the U.S. State Department in early 2009, when 58 per cent of Americans said they liked her.

But the wheels fell off shortly after she left the Obama administration: When her memoir 'Hard Choices' his bookshelves, her favorability number bottomed out at 24 per cent.

The most recent survey, conducted March 21-24, shows she's barely rebounded since then.

There's bad news also for Clinton-backers who hope her 'email-gate' scandal has only temporarily poisoned the public perceptions.

Two-thirds of those surveyed said the brewing scandal had no impact on their opinion, giving her precious little ground to make up even if the controversy fades. 

In addition to Clinton's use of a private, unaudited email server for all her messages while she was the Obama administration's top diplomat, she continues to be dogged by accusations that her family foundation accepted millions of dollars from foreign governments during the same timeframe.

CBS pollsters did not ask whether that embarrassing news had an impact on how Americans see her.

But her responses to the email kerfuffle have produced mixed results.

Americans appear evenly divided over whether Clinton's explanations satisfied their concerns. Forty-two per cent said yes, while 40 per cent said no.

LONG MEMORY: Some part of voters' negative impressions of Mrs. Clinton may harken back to her time as first lady

Thirty-eight per cent said they believe Clinton kept the State Department out of the loop on her emails principally to shield work-related communications from the public. Forty-nine percent believed her claim that she did it out of 'convenience.'

On balance, Clinton's biggest hurdle may be her own words, stretching back into the 1990s when she was America's first lady. 

Forty-seven per cent of the people CBS polled said they don't believe she is 'honest and trustworthy' – 5 per cent more than the number who came down on Mrs. Clinton's side.
