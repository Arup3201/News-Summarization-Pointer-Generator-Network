Alastair Cook’s summer of reckoning as England captain begins in earnest at Lord’s on Thursday when he leads a side containing three debutants into what his opposite number says will be a hostile encounter against Sri Lanka.

All eyes will be on Cook as he attempts to show he has the captaincy skills to ease the winter misery by overcoming a team still indignant at what they see as English slurs on the legitimacy of spinner Sachithra Senanayake’s bowling action.

The controversial run-out of Jos Buttler, when backing up, by Senanayake in the final one-day international was still on the agenda on Wednesday. Angelo Mathews, the Sri Lanka captain, sought to justify his side’s ‘Mankading’ of Buttler by saying that Senanayake’s action had only ever been reported in England.

‘Everything started with the reporting of Sachithra,’ said  Mathews. ‘When people find a bowler difficult to handle they tend to report him. We all know it’s going to be a hostile series but we’re up for the challenge.’

It means both sides still feel hard done by - Cook said the ‘Mankading’ was ‘still  frustrating’ - as they approach an Investec series in which England will need to regain the faith of a public who might accept an ODI series loss to Sri Lanka but not one in Test cricket.

Without question there will be extra pressure on Cook, even though that might seem harsh after all he has achieved as a  batsman and as a captain in  winning in India and at home against Australia last summer.

Yet there is no doubt that Cook retains the full support of the England management, the ECB and his players. All he has to do is repay that faith.

‘It feels like a fresh start, it feels good,’ said Cook in the Lord’s sunshine. ‘I’ve got on really well with Peter Moores since he came back and it has been good to have Paul Farbrace with us. We’ve had two great days here in the build-up to this series and hopefully  people will be ready to go.’

Much has been made of the need for England to play positively and with aggression and, on a pitch which looks as green as the  outfield, Cook’s plan is to hit Sri Lanka hard with a four-man seam attack that seems sure to include the returning Liam Plunkett.

Yet if Cook’s critics are expecting a transformation in his captaincy style, they may be disappointed. He would be foolish to try to be a chameleon and attempt ‘funky’ field placings and bowling changes as Michael Clarke does.

Cook’s strengths are leading from the front and man-management. The best way for him to energise England is by scoring his first Test century in more than a year and allowing the newcomers - his opening partner Sam Robson, Moeen Ali and a virtual newcomer in Gary Ballance, who will bat at No 3 in this first Test ahead of Ian Bell and Joe Root - time to bed in to their new environment.

Two players who will not be at Lord’s, Buttler and Ben Stokes, have commanded almost as much attention as those who will take on Sri Lanka in this first of two Tests, but Cook was adamant England have got their selection right.

Stokes was the one glimmer of hope to emerge from the Ashes but England feel he has not played enough cricket after the self-inflicted blow of breaking a wrist when punching a locker out of frustration in the Caribbean.

‘He wasn’t quite ready,’ said Cook. ‘He’s only bowled 30-odd overs and has been a bit rusty, going for four-and-a-half or five an over. It’s a big ask to come back quickly from an injury like that.’

Steam in: Chris Jordan is another set to debut in England's attack after impressing in limited overs formats

Someone who plays despite not having much cricket is Matt Prior, another under extra pressure after being left out following England’s Ashes-losing defeat in Perth. He returns after just one first-class match as a wicketkeeper with Sussex because of his chronic achilles problem.

‘He has been picked because of his long-term record as an England player,’ said Cook. ‘He has a wealth of experience in a side that is changing. He’s a proven international whereas Ben Stokes isn’t quite there yet. Matt has a lot more to offer. I’m backing his ability and we should support him.’

It was good to hear Cook backing Prior. The captain had a big say in the appointment of Moores, the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and clearly now the personnel he wants alongside him at Lord’s. That is how it should be.

England's line-up: (back row) Gary Ballance, Moeen Ali, Liam Plunkett, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan and Sam Robson. (Front row) James Anderson, Matt Prior, captain Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad, Ian Bell and Joe Root

Start: 11am at Lord’s.

TV & Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 2 from 10am; BBC 5 Live Sports Extra from 10.25.

Umpires: Paul Reiffel (Australia),  Billy Bowden (NZ). TV: Steve Davis (Australia).

Match referee: Andy Pycroft (Zimbabwe).

Weather: Bathed in sun on Wednesday and expected to be kind for first three days.

Pitch watch: Alastair Cook says it’s the greenest he has ever seen it. England want as much pace, movement and bounce as possible.

If England fail this summer Cook will not have anything to complain about, yet with so many new faces and Plunkett playing his first Test in seven years, it would be unrealistic to expect them to hit the ground sprinting.

This is the first time they will have fielded three debutants since, well, their last Test, and the identities of two of those who played in Sydney, Boyd Rankin and Scott Borthwick, proves not all newcomers adapt quickly.

Ballance, who was the third debutant at the SCG, Robson, Moeen and Chris Jordan all have the ability to enjoy long England careers but, for now, they will need as much help as possible from the senior spine - in particular the captain.

England: Cook (capt), Robson, Ballance,  Bell, Root, Moeen, Prior (wkt), Broad, Jordan, Plunkett, Anderson.

Sri Lanka: K Silva, Karunaratne, Sangakkara,  M Jayawardene, 
Thirimanne, Mathews (capt), P Jayawardene (wkt), D Prasad, Herath, 
Pradeep, Eranga.
