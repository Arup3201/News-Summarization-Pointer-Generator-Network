Bankers and other finance workers scooped bonuses totalling an eye-watering £14billion this year, official figures revealed today.

Critics accused bankers of ‘greed’ for making such vast sums of money despite their role in triggering the current financial crisis.

The size of the massive windfall will outrage millions of ordinary hard-working Britons who face a daily battle to stay financially afloat.

The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show how the country’s finance sector is cut off from the pain facing everybody else.

Between April 2010 and March 2011, a total of £14billion in bonuses was paid out to workers in the 'finance and insurance' sector.

They account for just 4 per cent of the workers in this country – but they get about 40 per cent of the total of £35billion of bonuses which are paid out.

This year’s bumper crop of bonuses completely overshadows the bonuses paid out a decade ago, the ONS figures show.

In 2000/1, the total bonuses paid out to bankers and other finance workers added up to around £8billion.

Ten years later, they have jumped by £6billion a year, despite the industry bringing the world's economies to the brink of collapse.

Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: 'These banking bonus figures show sheer greed.

'Our country won’t believe "We are all in this together" until the Government gets a grip on bank bonuses.'

The figures show the average finance and insurance worker got a bonus of £12,500.

The average British worker, who earns about £25,000 and does not get a bonus, has to work for about six months to earn this amount of money.

Their finances are under attack from tax rises, such as VAT, pay freezes or paltry pay rises, soaring gas bills, rip-off petrol prices – and no bonus from their boss.

In (rare) agreement: Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, left, and Brendan Barber, head of the TUC, right, both criticised the huge bonus payouts

Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: 'The Chancellor’s austerity message has failed to reach the City, where a small clique of super-rich bankers has grabbed 40 per cent of all bonuses paid out in the UK.

'City bonuses are still far too high and the incentives for risky and damaging decisions far too great, especially when bankers know that taxpayers will have to pick up the tab.'

Some of the big bonus winners even work for banks which are part-owned by the taxpayer.

There are 323 'key staff' at Royal Bank of Scotland who shared a pay and bonus pot of £375million last year, equal to an average payout of £1.16million each.

By comparison, the rest of the country is being crippled by the first fall in disposable household income since 1981, according to the ONS.

The Bank of England governor, Sir 
Mervyn King, has warned that bankers' huge bonuses risk alienating 
ordinary Britons whose tax money is being used to shore up the financial
system.

He said 
recently: 'They are paying the price themselves and they are 
people...who don't get bonuses on the scale that people in the financial
services sector get.

'They are on much lower incomes [than bankers] and they are paying the price and I think this is a big political problem.'

The figures come after MPs on the Treasury Select Committee spoke of the fury of their constituents at the bonus handouts.

Andrea Leadsom, a Tory MP who used to work for Barclays, said her constituents, and those of other MPs, regularly write letters expressing their 'rage and absolute frustration'.

She said: 'They will lose their jobs almost certainly - their £20,000 to £30,000 a year jobs.

'And yet the chief executives who effectively as far as they are concerned got us into this mess are carrying on business as usual and are about to take home very generous bonuses.'

John Thurso, a Liberal Democrat MP, said ordinary workers did not understand why bankers need to be paid such large bonuses simply 'to do their job.'

He said other workers, such as 'surgeons, or soldiers or manufacturers or anybody else' do their job in a professional way without needing an extra financial incentive.
