A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of committing two rapes at a £32,000-a-year boarding school, it was revealed tonight.

The teenager was detained and has since been released on bail following the allegations at the private Repton School in Derbyshire, which was attended by Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

The school, which also includes author Roald Dahl and actor Tom Chambers among its alumni, caters for male and female boarding and day pupils aged 13 to 18 and dates back to 1559.

A Derbyshire Police spokesman said: ‘Officers investigating allegations of sexual offences at Repton School have arrested a 17-year-old youth.

‘The youth was arrested by officers on Tuesday on suspicion of committing two rapes. He was questioned and released on police bail while enquiries continue.’

The allegations date back to October 4. Headmaster Robert Holroyd said: ‘I can confirm that a police investigation is currently being conducted into an alleged sexual offence at Repton School.

‘The welfare of the pupils in our care is our overriding priority, and we are giving the police all the assistance we can in this matter.'

He added: ‘The investigation does not involve any member of staff, past or present. As you will appreciate, given the police investigation, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.’

Clarkson achieved nine O-levels as a Repton boarder in the 1970s, but claimed in an autobiography to have been expelled before taking his A-levels for ‘drinking, smoking and making a general nuisance’ of himself.

Repton charges £10,547 per term (£31,641 per year) for boarding students, and £7,825 per term (£23,475 per year) for day students. It currently has 665 pupils - 364 boys and 301 girls.
