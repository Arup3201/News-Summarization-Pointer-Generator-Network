'Too posh': David Cameron is failing to connect with female voters

David Cameron suffered a double blow yesterday with two new polls showing he is haemorrhaging support in marginal seats and among women voters.

One survey found that Labour’s lead is widening in the 40 seats Mr Cameron must win because Tory voters are defecting to Ukip.

In 32 seats where Labour is challenging the Conservatives, Ed Miliband’s lead has grown from 9 to 14 points over the last two years.

That would put Labour on course for a majority of 60 in 2015, suggests the survey by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft.

A separate survey commissioned by the Mumsnet website suggests Labour is now 13 points ahead because women see Mr Cameron as too posh and ‘out of touch’.

The poll, carried out by Ipsos Mori, found that 42 per cent of women would back Labour, compared with 29 per cent who would vote Tory.

Among women aged 18-34 the gap widens to a 25-point Labour lead.

Justine Roberts, chief executive of Mumsnet, said: ‘On the key issues of the economy and employment and particularly where the cuts have fallen, women feel like there is a lack of someone looking out for their interests.

‘One bit of the narrative [about Cameron] that stands up is this elitist Oxbridge-Eton man who doesn’t quite get women.’

Labour is even ahead even among professional women who traditionally back the Conservatives.

In the 32 where Labour was second in 2010, there has been an 8.5 per cent swing from the Tories to Labour.

That is enough for Labour to win all 32 seats and another 66 similar constituencies that Lord Ashcroft did not survey.

Crucially, the poll reveals that since 2011, Labour has lost support in the marginal seats, but is benefiting from Tory defections to Ukip.

Labour’s support has dropped 1 per cent over the last two years from 44 to 43 per cent, but Tory support has dropped six points from 35 per cent to 29 per cent and Ukip is now on 11 per cent.

Lord Ashcroft said the Tories faced a ‘formidable’ challenge. ‘The tripling of Ukip’s vote share in marginal seats since 2010 threatens to put Ed Miliband in Downing Street in spite of Labour’s lukewarm appeal, ‘ he said. The results fuelled demands by some Tory MPs for the party to strike a general election pact with Ukip before the polls in 2015.

One Tory MP said: ‘The doom and gloom has been replaced with complacency in recent weeks.

‘This should make Downing Street focus again.’

Yvette Cooper, the shadow minister for women, said David Cameron had a ‘blind spot’ with women. ‘Under this government, we have a cost of living crisis that is hitting women hardest – yet David Cameron and Nick Clegg don’t even seem to notice or care. These figures show women are fed up with how out of touch the Government is with their lives.’
