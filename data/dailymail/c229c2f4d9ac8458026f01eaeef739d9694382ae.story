Real Madrid have held further conversations with Manchester United as they press to take Javier Hernandez on loan.

The Mexico striker will leave United on Monday and the Santiago Bernabeu is looking increasingly like his next destination.

Real, who have Karim Benzema as their only recognised centre forward, opened discussions on Saturday with the player being informed of their interest while returning from Saturday's game with Burnley.

Hernandez has offers from Juventus and Valencia also while Atletico Madrid expressed an interest prior to bidding for Torino's Alessio Cerci. 

Tottenham remain confident of signing Danny Welbeck on loan while Tom Cleverley will leave United also on loan with Aston Villa still favourites.

Leicester City have also made an offer for United prospect Tom Lawrence, 20, who was given his debut by Ryan Giggs at the end of last season against Hull City.

Arsenal made late a check on Loic Remy's transfer status ahead of Monday's transfer deadline.

The QPR striker has completed a move to Chelsea, but the Gunners enquired to see on how far his move to Stamford Bridge is down the line.

But it is understood the North London club were told that his move to Chelsea was virtually complete meaning Arsene Wenger will have to look elsewhere for a new forward.

Sources at the Emirates Stadium insist Wenger believes he has enough firepower in his squad to cope with the absence of Olivier Giroud.

And a deal for a new striker is looking increasingly unlikely as we head into the final hours of the transfer window.

Southampton have offered £11.8million for Red Bull Salzburg forward Sadio Mane.

The pacy Senegal international can play on either wing or behind the striker and has been the subject of interest from West Ham and Manchester City this summer.

Mane, 22, has scored 45 goals in 86 appearances for Salzburg and Ronald Koeman believes he can solve his problem left side position.

Koeman could also make one final bid to sign Tottenham winger Andros Townsend.

Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel has changed his mind and agreed to join AC Milan on loan.

The young Holland midfielder had told the Italians he wanted to stay at Stamford Bridge and fight for his place but with his chances looking limited he has decided Milan would be the next best step for his career.

Burnley are poised with a £3million bid for Bolton midfielder Mark Davies. The 26-year-old has been a target for QPR in recent seasons but he had a bad injury last year and has just returned to full fitness and form. 

Bolton need the money and will listen to reasonable offers. Burnley manager Sean Dyche has also made a move for Hull City midfielder George Boyd and hopes to wrap up a deal by Monday with Boyd agreeing a three-year deal.

Micah Richards will look to find a route out of Manchester City on Monday, with Sunderland, Fiorentina and West Ham interested in the defender.

The versatile defender has been told he can leave the Etihad Stadium this summer, but his £8million asking price has proved prohibitive.

But Richards' representatives are working on finding him a move away in the next 24 hours.

He knows his chances of first team football at City are minimal with Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna ahead of him in the right-back pecking order.

And he is keen to leave in order to reinvigorate his career.

Crystal Palace have made the capture of a new left-back a top priority, with Tottenham's Zeki Fryers and QPR's Armand Traore under consideration.

Having already taken Wilfried Zaha on loan Neil Warnock will be busy ahead of Monday night's transfer deadline.

Warnock is also interested in Norwich striker Gary Hooper, who is open to leaving Norwich.
