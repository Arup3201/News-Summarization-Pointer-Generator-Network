'The
boys' mom and I were in the kitchen, preparing the kids' lunch just 
like we always do. We were just talking. Thenâ€¦ I can't describe it.'

Edgar Laso, 35, who also lives in the house, said the boy's brother, seven year-old Josue, was in bed at the time.

'Some of the glass cut Josue's legs and body. There was blood everywhere,' he told the New York Daily News.

Eight of the 11 bus passengers had minor injuries.

Cops do not believe criminality played a factor in the crash.

Inspector Kenneth Lack, a Nassau County Police Department

by the bus driver to alert him, including honking his horn before the 
accident.

A spokesperson for NICE said the company 'is cooperating with police officials and has its own team investigating the incident'.
