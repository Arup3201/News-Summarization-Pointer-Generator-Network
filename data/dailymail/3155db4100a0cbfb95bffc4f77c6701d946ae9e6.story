Animal welfare staff are desperately trying to re-home 25 black cats found crammed into a pensioner's one-room flat.

They were stunned to find the cats, which were all given names starting with the letter H, after being called to the property by the elderly man's relative after he had to move homes due to ill health.

But despite knowing they were going to be collecting a few animals, the Cats Protection staff had no idea just how many jet black cats they would be collecting from the small, one-room flat in Haywards Heath, West Sussex.

The cats, thought to be aged from four weeks to six years old, were all unneutered and had been breeding uncontrollably.

Staff at Cats Protection's National Cat Adoption Centre, in Haywards Heath, are now hoping to find homes for all the black cats.

Centre manager Danielle Draper said that although all were in good health, many were very nervous of people.

She said: 'Finding homes for all these cats is going to be a huge challenge and we desperately need to hear from people who may be able to offer one a home.

'None of the cats had been neutered and so, in just a few years, the number of cats in the home had grown enormously.

'Cats are prolific breeders and this case shows how easy it is for things to get out of hand.'

One unneutered female can give birth to around 18 kittens every year and be responsible for up to 20,000 descendants within five years, as kittens can breed when they are four months old.

Despite the cramped conditions, the cats were all healthy and well-fed. Pictured is one of the cats, named Hula

Despite the cramped conditions, they are healthy cats, well-fed, with glossy coats and no signs of illness.

She added: 'But with so many cats it seems that they were not properly socialised so they are very nervous of people.

'We're doing a lot of work with them to help bring them out of their shells and we're hoping that, in time, they will settle in well into new homes.

'We are bracing ourselves for a challenge - black cats are hard to find homes for anyway, as people often prefer different colours.

'And a nervous black cat is an even harder prospect to find a new home for.

'I really hope we can find some owners who can see past the nerves and spot the potential for these lovely cats to become family pets.

'They deserve to be in a nice new home so we're hoping they won't have to spend too long with us at the centre.'

Black cats are seen as good luck charms in most of the world, including Scotland and Ireland, but in England they are seen as bad omens.

Haribo, Humbug, Hula, Humphrey, Hettie, Hattie, Hedwig, Hippy, Hugo, Harriet, Harmony, Harold, Harry, Horace, Hobson, Heidi, Hawk, Hummingbird, Hamster, Happy, Hiccup, Honeybee, Hedgehog, Hippo and Herbert.
