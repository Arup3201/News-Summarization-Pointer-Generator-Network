An insensitive customer ignored a man who lay dying metres away from him so that he could order a glass of wine, an inquest heard today.

Chartered surveyor Peter Westropp was killed by a falling lump of masonry as he sat drinking with friends outside a restaurant in Battersea, southwest London.

The 27-year-old and his friends had just moved table when blocks of stone crashed down outside Le Bouchon Bordelais, with one hitting him on the head and knocking him unconscious.

But as Mr Westropp lay dying under the fallen debris, just four days before his 28th birthday, one selfish man carried on ordering drinks just metres from the commotion.

Tragic: Chartered surveyor Peter Westropp, 27, was killed when falling masonry shattered his skull as he shared a drink with friends

Ms Kripena said: 'A customer asked me what happened and I said the masonry has collapsed and someone was seriously hurt or dead.

'Another guy who was with him wanted to 
order another glass of wine. I screamed at him "Are you mad? Can’t you 
see what has happened? We are closed".'

The dedicated Arsenal fan died soon afterwards having suffered devastating head injuries.

The waitress went to a back room in the bar to get a tablecloth to place over Mr Westropp’s body.

The inquest was also told by the bistro's manager said that around three months before the death, a driver lost control of her car and crashed into the building.

Mr Naick M’Bae, the restaurant's duty manager on the night Mr Westropp died, said: 'I can remember one significant incident leading up to this incident, where damage was caused to the front of the building.

'Approximately three months before this incident a car driven by a woman lost control and ran into the restaurant hitting the wall between units five and seven.

'This caused damage to the patio window and the partition wall between units seven and nine.'

The manager said he had also spotted youths jumping on the restaurant’s boundary wall just four days before Mr Westropp’s death

He said: 'The only other incident I can recall was a number of youths jumped between the boundary terrace wall.

'They were climbing onto the wall and jumpng on the side of the terrace.

'The canopy was up and they were jumping on the wall and jumping down. It was high jinx.'

Several shops and businesses have been damaged in the days before Peter’s death as widespread rioting swept through the capital in August last year. 

Le Bouchon closed on Monday and Tuesday evening due to the riots, but had reopened on the Wednesday, the night Peter died. 

Both Mr M’Bae and Ms Kripena told the inquest they were unaware of any damage to the bar during the riots.

His father John Westropp told Westminster Coroner’s Court that friends and family are still coming to terms with the tragedy.

He said: 'Peter has left a gaping hole in our lives and is sadly missed by so many.

‘What has shone through all this is that throughout his tragically short life, Peter made countless friends.

‘He loved socialising, sometimes a bit too much, and I think he influenced many people’s lives for the better.

‘We know from talking to his age group that they were all severely shocked by his death.'

Mr Westropp had recently moved to Battersea from his family home in Bromley, Kent.

He was with friends at the bar in Battersea Rise when the incident happened, at around 9.15pm, on August 10 last year.

They finished dinner across the road and headed to Le Bouchon where Peter Westropp bought the first pitcher of beer.

The scene: Westropp was sitting outside French restaurant and bar, Le Bouchon Bordelais, on Battersea Rise in Battersea, south London, when he was hit by a stone slab

Friend Harry Pope said: ‘We had been sat there for about 15 minutes when we heard a noise.

‘There was no warning, it was very sudden.

‘It was falling masonry from the building and it hit Peter on the head.

‘When
it happened, there was obviously quite a commotion inside the bar and 
around the tables, with everyone trying to see what had happened.

‘Peter clearly wasn’t OK, and at that point I was overcome by emotion.’

Mr Westropp was immediately knocked unconscious and had a large wound on his head.

Police were called to the scene amid fears that the incident might have been riot related.

PC Steven Hayles said told the court: ‘I was told friends had been sitting with Peter at a table when suddenly a block of masonry came down and hit him, and he was knocked unconscious immediately.

‘It had come from above the restaurant sign, by a window of the flats.’

Following his death, around 650 packed out a church for his funeral, and friends and family have continued to pay tribute to his life in the year since.

John Westropp told the hearing: ‘He was an ardent Arsenal fan, attended as many games home and away as possible.

‘Thanks to friends, he will be remembered by a plaque in the new memorial floor at the stadium.’

A memorial trust has been set up in his honour since his death, with the inaugural fund raising dinner held last month raising £18,000 for charity.

‘The trust will raise funds for the Carers Trust, which Peter would have needed no doubt is he survived the tragic accident’, said Mr Westropp.

Peter was born in Islington, but his family moved to Bromley two years later.

He graduated from Leeds University with a BA in Geography in 2002 before gaining a masters in real estate management from Oxford Brookes University.

He had worked at leading London property consultancy firm Gerald Eve since 2007, and was dating a Irish woman called Ellie at the time.

His father said he loved going on ski trips with friends and had travelled the world in a gap year, visiting every continent except for Antarctica.

Peter had been living with his parents in Shortlands, Bromley, before moving to Battersea.

The inquest into the cause of his death, which is due to last five days, continues.
