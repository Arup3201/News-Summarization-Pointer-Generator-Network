A man who tipped the scales at 35 stone due to years of binge drinking and eating junk food says he should be given gastric bypass surgery on the NHS in order to lose weight.

Mark, 45, from Glasgow suffers from lymphangitis - a painful swelling of his legs - and is at risk of diabetes because of his size.

He struggles with his mobility and has had to have hand rails and extra banisters fitted around his home to help him use the stairs. He also needs straps to help him lift his limbs into bed and can't put his own shoes on because of his girth.

Scottish Mark who tips the scales at 35 stone due to years of binge drinking and eating junk food says he should be given gastric bypass surgery on the NHS in order to lose weight

'I feel restricted in what I can do, caged,' the father admitted.

He said gastric bypass surgery, which costs £9,000 on the NHS, is his only hope.

'I have always been a big guy. From the age of 13 a lot of drink and food. I reckon lager had a lot to do with the weight initially,' he explained.

'I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I have lost weight and it's the easiest thing in the world to put it back on. All I am looking for is help to keep it off by restricting what I can eat.'

He says his problem with food is an addiction and he should be supported in the same way people are when they try to give up addictions to cigarettes and alcohol. 

'Especially in Scotland we live in a fried culture, everything is fried and greasy or fat, usually that stuff tastes the best. There's not enough healthy options out there.

'It's an addiction, all I want is that wee bit of help.' 

Mark shares his story on Channel 4 show NHS: £2bn A Week And Counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat.

Mark, who has been married to wife Lorraine for 30 years, has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the NHS in Scotland for a third time. 

He can't afford to pay for the op privately as he was made redundant from his job at a delivery company two years ago and is now on benefits. 

He said: 'It all boils down to money. Your life means nothing if it costs too much.' 

He admitted he knows people watching will think he doesn't deserve to have the operation on the NHS. 

But in the long run, it could save NHS funds as they wouldn't have to treat him for diabetes or other health conditions he may develop as a result of his obesity in the future.

Professor David Kerrigan, a bariatric surgeon who treats both NHS and private patients, agrees that weight loss surgery can be cost effective for the NHS. 

He said: 'I know a lot of people won't have any sympathy for the sort of patients I treat but these people have real problems. They are not a little bit chubby wanting to look better, they are ill because of the obesity they developed. 

'I don't care how or why they got it, I know they are at the bottom of a deep hole they can't get out of and the surgery offers them an escape.

'This surgery is transformative for people's lives, there are very few operations we do that can achieve that.'

Marks added: 'If it stops me getting diabetes then it benefits me and them, those costs can then go somewhere else.'

The show also interviews other people desperate to be treated on the NHS to show viewers how difficult it can be to decide whose need is greater. 

There are children born with cerebral palsy who need Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) - a procedure that can significantly reduce muscle stiffness helping them to walk more easily and reducing painful muscle spasms.

Meanwhile, Becky, 24, from Grimsby, is one of thousands of women in the UK in need of IVF treatment in order to fulfill her dream to become a mother.

Three cycles of IVF on the NHS costs £10,000 and Becky has been denied the treatment because her partner, Mark, 38, a scaffolder, already has a child from a previous relationship.

Becky is infertile thanks to getting an STI when she was a teenager and she said she's heartbroken that IVF is her only chance to have a baby.

She said: 'When I was younger I couldn't wait to grow up and have a family. I have always loved kids so when you have been told you face a life with no children it's pretty tough, you have to live with that every day, it's not a nice feeling.

'It guts you to think you were stupid enough to trust someone and they gave you an STI. And then to find out later in life that's the reason you can't have children, it guts me. 

'I sometimes feel disgusted with myself. People make mistakes, I was young and stupid, it was not my fault. I didn't know he was sleeping with Tom, Dick and Harry behind my back.

'It's so hard, family and friends keep making announcements that they are having a baby and you are happy for them but deep down you're gutted as it's all you ever wanted.'
