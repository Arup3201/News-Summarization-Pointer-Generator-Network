A retired headmaster has been immortalised in stone - as a gargoyle overlooking his historic old school. 

Dr Richard Shephard was in charge of the Minster School at York Minster for 19 years where the stone caricature was unveiled yesterday. 

He said: 'I don't look on myself as the Hunchback of Notre Dame, but I am very grateful they have done it. It is very thoughtful of people who decided to do it to put it there. 

Bizarre tribute: A retired headmaster has been immortalised in stone - as a gargoyle overlooking his historic old school

'To be honest I was astonished when I heard it was being done, wherever it had gone I would have been delighted, but obviously it is very appropriate.' 

Dr Shephard was also Chamberlain at the Minster and was awarded the MBE for his service. 

He was kept in the dark about the carving but admitted he spotted the resemblance to himself as stonemason Matt Hodgkinson worked on it. 

He added: 'Having oneself immortalised on the Minster as a grotesque may not be to everyone's taste. 

'But I am flattered and honoured that this piece of sculpture has been incorporated into the cathedral that has played such a large part of my life for many years.'

The gargoyle - with doctorate hat and holding its hand as if conducting music - has been installed as part of renovations to the east face of the Minster. 

Rebecca Thompson, superintendent of works for York Minster, said: 'When we discovered that one of our decayed grotesques overlooking the Minster school needed replacement, incorporating a permanent tribute to Richard seemed like too good an opportunity to miss.' 

Dr Shephard retired last year after 30 years working at the minster, including 11 as director of development for the York Minster Fund after leaving the school.

Minster School in York is an independent school for boys and girls aged 3 to 13, and annual fees fall between £6,000 and £8,000.
