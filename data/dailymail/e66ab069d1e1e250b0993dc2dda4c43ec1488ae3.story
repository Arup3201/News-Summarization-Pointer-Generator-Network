Michael Brown Sr said on Wednesday that the grand jury's decision not to indict white cop Darren Wilson for the fatal shooting of his son, an unarmed black teenager, reinforced to him that he was living in a 'racist state'.

Michael Brown's father and mother, Lesley McSpadden, reacted with fury to Officer Darren Wilson's first interview on Wednesday, saying: 'I don't think he wanted to kill my son but he wanted kill someone.'

Mr Brown Sr told Reverend Al Sharpton that he also believed St Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch 'crucified' his 18-year-old son's character. 

The parents attended the National Action Network's House Of Justice in Harlem, New York on Wednesday afternoon where they prayed with Sharpton; the family of Eric Garner, a father-of-six who died in police custody in New York this summer; and the partner of Akai Gurley, the Brooklyn man a police officer shot and killed last week.

Reverend Sharpton said at the Wednesday press conference: 'As you see, they share each other's pain.' 

He added: ''These families didn't choose to be public figures... they have been thrown into a painful spotlight.' 

Mr Brown Sr said earlier that the grand jury's decision 'just let me know that where we live is not what we thought, or what I thought. 

'It's what people have been saying all the time, for a nice little minute: that this was a racist state.' 

The teenager's parents had earlier spoken to CBS, alongside their lawyer Benjamin Crump, a day after Wilson said he was only doing his job on the day he killed the unarmed teen and that now, he wanted to get on with a 'normal life'.

Ms McSpadden said: 'He [Wilson] says that his conscience is clear. How can your conscience be clear after killing somebody even after it was accidental death?' 

Ferguson cop Darren Wilson has said that he has a clear conscience after he shot dead teenager Michael Brown because he was doing his job as a police officer 

The grieving mother broke down when she said that she couldn't even donate Michael's organs following his death. 

Officer Wilson has maintained that he made the right choice to use lethal force in the fight in broad daylight on August 9 - and would do it all over again because Brown went for his gun and he feared he would be killed. 

However Ms McSpadden said on Wednesday: 'I don't believe a word of it. I know my son too well, he wouldn't provoke anyone like that.' 

She also denounced the violence on the streets of Ferguson following the grand jury announcement  on Monday that Wilson would not be indicted for Brown's death.

'We continue to ask for calm and protest with them in a peaceful manner,' Ms McSpadden said.'We can't be held accountable for others' actions.'

Ms McSpadden's call for peace came two days after she appeared at a protest in Ferguson.  Although she wore sunglasses, her anger and devastation were clear as tears ran down her face.

'Everybody wants me to be calm. You know what them bullets did to my son!' she sobbed. 

Her husband, Louis Head, has drawn criticism after he appeared to incense the crowd, by screaming: 'Burn this b**** down'.

On Tuesday, dozens of cities across the U.S. held demonstrations about the cop killing of Michael Brown.

Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr, appeared on CBS on Wednesday where they said they ' don't believe a word' of Darren Wilson's account of shooting dead their teenage son 

In Ferguson, authorities made 58 arrests overnight on Tuesday as violence once again broke out on the streets. Among those arrested were 28 people from out of state and included seven felony charges.

Michael Brown Sr said that he wanted something good to emerge from his son's tragic death. 

'We want change,' he said. 'We don't accept our son is gone, but we're dealing with it. We want change all over.' 

The parents earlier said that Wilson's decision to conduct an exclusive interview with GMA anchor George Stephanopoulos, added 'insult to injury'.

Wilson used the interview to walk step-by-step through his actions on the day that Brown died.

While he feels remorse for Brown’s death, Wilson maintained that he made the right choice to use lethal force in the fight and would do it all over again.

'I don’t think it’s haunting; it’s always going to be something that happened,' Wilson said. ‘The reason I have a clear conscience is because I know I did my job right.'

The officer said that he loved his job on the Ferguson force but refused to say whether a decision had been made on whether he would return.

Wilson also confirmed on Wednesday that he had recently gotten married and his wife was pregnant, adding that the couple 'just want to live a normal life'.

However, Wilson conceded that there would be 'a new normal' for him. 

Wilson said that 'stressful was an understatement' to describe his life following the Michael Brown shooting.

'You are always looking to see if someone is following you or has noticed you,' Wilson said.

'I grew a beard, it was uncomfortable but it helped. You take precautions - where you sit in a restaurant, where you drive.'

The shooting death of Michael Brown, and the subsequent failure of the grand jury to indict Wilson over the killing, has led to violent protests in Ferguson this week while mass demonstrations has swept through more than 170 U.S. cities.
