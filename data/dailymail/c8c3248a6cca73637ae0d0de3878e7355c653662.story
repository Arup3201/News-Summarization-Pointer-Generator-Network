A college football player has been arrested and charged with murder.

Troy University (AL) linebacker Dimitri Miles, 21, is in jail after being accused by police of shooting dead Marquise McClendon, 26, also of Troy, Sunday morning in an off-campus apartment.

It is not clear how both men knew each other, and an officer with the Troy Police Department declined to comment when reached by MailOnline.

Mr McClendon was shot just before 8am in an apartment that neither he nor Mr Miles were a resident of – it is not known if others were present for the incident, and the circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear, according to WAKA.

Neighbors told WSFA they heard several shots fired and worried for their safety.

‘It's really shocking because it's usually pretty quiet over here and it's not even a lot of people that stay in this complex,’ Breauna Crayton told the station.

‘It's really something that we all wouldn't expect to happen and it's like it's getting closer to me and it's not really a safe feeling.’

Not allowed to play: Mr Miles was academically ineligible to play this season, but has now been suspended from the team and banned from the school over the charges

Mr McClendon was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to reports.

An investigation quickly pointed to Miles, who was charged with murder and tossed into Pike County Jail on a $100,000 bond.

The university then quickly moved to distance itself from him.

‘First and foremost, anytime there is a loss of life it is tragic event and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victim and his family,’ John Hartwell, Troy University athletic director said in a statement to the Troy Messenger.

Scene of the crime: The shooting happened at this apartment complex, just blocks from campus

Family man: Mr Miles also has at least one son

‘Dimitri Miles was a walk-on student-athlete on our football team who was academically ineligible to compete in competition this past season, but practiced as a member of the scout team,’ Mr Hartwell continued.

‘His association with our football team and the Troy Athletic Department has been terminated as a result of these charges which are associated with an incident that occurred off campus,’ said the statement.

Troy University Dean of Students told WSFA that Mr Miles has been suspended indefinitely from the school.

Mr McClendon leaves behind at least one child, and a girlfriend.
