A woman with multiple sclerosis was forced to get out of her power wheelchair and carried on stage to speak at a disability conference.

Speaker Deborah Haygarth was hoisted out of her chair and escorted by two people up the four stairs between the floor and the raised stage.

Disability rights advocate Jax-Jacki Brown was at the National Disability Summit at Melbourne's Sheraton Hotel last Thursday and was outraged by the oversight.

Speaker Deborah Haygarth, who has multiple sclerosis, was forced to get out of her wheelchair and carried by two people on and off the stage

'I thought 'They're going to pull out a ramp, they obviously planned for this',' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'No ramp was forthcoming so the next best thing is they are going to move the table and microphone so she can sit with everyone else, but they didn't do that. 

'They suggested she move out of her chair and be carried on by two people.'

Ms Brown - who is a wheelchair-user herself - said it was degrading to see a person in a wheelchair be treated like that.

'It just removes your agency and your power to move around the world,' she said.

'It makes you dependent on someone to give assistance. 

To add further insult, chairs were stacked inside the disabled toilets, preventing people from using it

'It's not the way you want to be able to be seen. It's not an empowering way to enter a stage.'

To add further insult, the disabled toilet at the venue had been stacked up with chairs, preventing people in wheelchairs who had to go to the bathroom from using it.

Ms Brown said disabled toilets were often seen as secondary storage spaces.

'To use a toilet is quite crucial and a fundamental right that non-disabled people take for granted,' she said.

'It speaks volumes about the space the National Disability Summit was held in. 

'I mean we don't even have the right to pee.'

Susan Ryan, who is the disability discrimination commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission, said she had written to the organisers of the summit.

The Sheraton Hotel in Melbourne has apologised for the incident, saying they 'fell short' of delivering all their duties, and vowed a similar incident would not reoccur.

'On behalf of Sheraton Melbourne Hotel, I would like to apologise for the incident that took place at the National Disability Summit. We fell short of delivering all of the necessary requirements and this is disappointing,' Hal Philp, General Manager at Sheraton Melbourne Hotel said.

'At Sheraton Melbourne Hotel, the comfort and safety of our guests is of paramount importance to us. Whilst these are isolated incidents, it is nonetheless a lesson learnt. 

'We will ensure every effort is made to further improve the accessibility in our hotel premises, so that such incidents do not re-occur,' Mr Philip added.

But this is not the first controversy the National Disability Summit has attracted.

This year, only seven people with a disability were allowed to attend the two-day conference, causing a social media outrage. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the organisers and Sheraton Hotel for comment on the matter.
