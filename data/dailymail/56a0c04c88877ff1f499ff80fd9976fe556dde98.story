Slaving over a hot stove could soon become a thing of the past.

Lazy chefs everywhere will be breathing a sigh of relief now that there is a new kitchen gadget that can stir your food for you.

The Stirio, which operates using a wind-up motor, can stir a pot of food completely unassisted for 45 minutes.

As kitchen gadgets go, there is no end of pointless inventions out there, from automatic kitchen towel dispensers to corn on the cob strippers.

But the Norwegian company behind the Stirio, Unikia, claim there is nothing as effective or useful on the market and has already sold 60,000 of them.

They said inspiration for the Stirio came from their love of porridge, which is eaten at various meal times during the cold winter months in the Scandinavian country, and needing something to stir it continually.

The gadget can also be used for risottos, which, as keen kitchen cooks will know, requires constant stirring, stews and chillis.

It comes with adjustable axle and arms so can fit in to any size pan, and has two speed settings depending on what you are cooking.

The team who came up with the idea said similar products have been invented but none is available in Europe.

Project manager, Jørgen Solstad, said: ‘We had tried other stirrers that barely managed to stir sauces. We wanted a true helper in the kitchen, that could stir anything. It needed to be powerful, but simple enough that anyone could use it.’

The product runs on rechargeable batteries and can be taken apart and washed in the dishwasher.

The Stirio also promises not to leave anything stuck at the bottom of the pan.

Mr Solstad added: ‘We also wanted it to be as versatile as possible, as people have different needs, and not to forget, different pots.

'The axle, the arms and the blades are all adjustable, so Stirio will fit onto all standardized pots and will stir all the way out to the edges, ensuring that nothing will burn ever again.

‘We ended up with a product that we can be proud of. It’s a real helper in the kitchen, it can stir anything, leaving you free to enjoy your time.’

The Stirio costs £41.50 which includes a charging station.
