A Ukrainian military transport plane which was shot down along the country's eastern border was likely to have been hit by a rocket fired from neighbouring Russia, Ukraine's defence minister has claimed.

Rebels in conflict-wracked eastern Ukraine immediately claimed responsibility for downing the Antonov-26 which authorities say may have been carrying up to 20 people.

But Ukrainian defence minister Valeriy Heletey said the plane was flying at an altitude of 21,300 feet, which is too high to be reached with separatists' weapons.

The shooting followed a Moscow threat to use  'surgical retaliatory strikes', according to respected newspaper Kommersant.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the report. 'I don't comment on this in any way. It's complete nonsense.'

In the last two weeks, the government has halved the territory held by pro-Russia separatists, who have been forced back into strongholds around the eastern cities of Luhansk and Donetsk.

Those two mostly Russian-speaking regions have declared independence from the government in Kiev.

Fighting intensified around Luhansk as government forces stepped up efforts to disrupt rebel lines and reclaim more territory from the faltering insurgency. One resident said panic was gripping the city.

Despite reports of military successes, however, Ukraine's president announced he has more evidence that Russia has directly supported a separatist insurgency against his government that is dragging into its fourth month.

Today 
Russian state television has aired an unconfirmed report claiming the 
Ukrainian army publicly nailed a three-year-old boy to a board in a 
former rebel stronghold.

In
 move that has provoked a storm of criticism, Channel One broadcast an 
interview in which a woman gave graphic details of the alleged incident.

She
 said she recently saw Ukrainian soldiers round up people in  the 
Ukrainian flashpoint city of Slavyansk and nail an insurgent's child to a
 notice board.

Attempts
 to corroborate the report have so far failed and Ukraine responded by 
accusing Russia of ratcheting up its propaganda war.

A spokeswoman for Ukraine's interior ministry, Natalya Stativko, on Monday slammed the report as 'following in the footsteps of Goebbels,' Nazi Germany's minister of propaganda.

'The cruder and the more monstrous the lie, the better it will look for the Russian propaganda machine,' Stativko said.

Five busloads of 'Internally Displaced People' from the towns of Slavyansk, Karlovka, Maryinka and Donetsk left this morning for the Rostov region in Russia to ask for refugee status there

Galina 
Timchenko, former editor of Lenta.ru, a prominent news portal in Moscow,
 said the report was a gross breach of professional ethics by one of 
Russia's most watched channels.

'This
 is an egregious violation of professional ethics,' she said. 'Not only 
is there no proof anywhere -- this is not even being questioned.'

Opposition leader Alexei Navalny denounced the channel as 'nutty' for airing the report.

'Are
 they completely sick to be concocting this?' he wrote on his blog. 'The
 people behind this are a danger to society and what they are doing is a
 true crime.'

Representatives of Channel One declined immediate comment.

The report featured a woman named as Galina Pyshnyak, who was interviewed at a refugee camp in Russia, describing the incident that she labelled an act of revenge.

'They gathered women on the square because there are no more men. Women, girls, old people,' Pyshnyak said.

'They took a child of around three years old, a little boy in his underwear and a T-shirt and nailed him to a notice board like Jesus. One was nailing him and two others holding him.'

Russian official rhetoric often compares events in Ukraine to Nazi Germany and calls the pro-Western Kiev government a 'fascist junta'.

Russia's defence ministry said today that Ukrainian jets carried out five air strikes against separatist positions close to Lugansk but there was no confirmation of rebel claims that Kiev had massed tanks in the outskirts ahead of a major push into the city.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin today  threatened military strikes on Ukraine in an alarming escalation of the worst conflict between former member countries of the Soviet Union.

Russia is swelling its troop numbers again on the border with Ukraine amid new fears of an invasion of the east of the country, claimed Kiev sources yesterday.

The force could be sabotage squads or masked as 'peacekeepers', warned military analyst Dmytro Tymchuk.

Tymchuk claimed Russian special forces and intelligence brigades were massing across the border from Ukraine's Donetsk territory.

'Special force units are coming to Rostov region,' he said. 'This is reconnaissance and sabotage groups of staff brigades of the Russian GRU intelligence special forces.

'According to our data, the commanders of these units have been told that they will be brought into the territory of Ukraine on July 15.'

Tymchuk, coordinator of the Information Resistance Group, has previously accurately predicted troop deployments in the bloody conflict which has seen almost 600 people killed in the EU's backyard.

He warned that Russian forces could be sent into Ukraine as "peacekeepers" or in green uniforms without insignia as happened when Crimea was grabbed  in March.

Or a wave of sabotage squads could be sent into Ukraine to back "terrorists" - as pro-Western Kiev refers to insurgent pro-Moscow fighters.

Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko yesterday claimed Russian troops were already fighting alongside the rebels inside his country.

'Russian staff officers are taking part in military operations against Ukrainian forces,' he said.

And official sources echoed the fears of a troop build-up, the month after Vladimir Putin assured Western leaders his armed forces were going back to their barracks.

'Deployment of Russian units and military equipment across the border from the Sumy and Luhansk border points was noticed. The Russian Federation continues to build up troops on the border,' warned Ukraine national security council spokesman Andriy Lysenko.

Kiev insists that a Russian man killed at a border town was shot by pro-Moscow separatists in an act of provocation.

'Fighters systematically fire mortars and shoot into Russian territory, which killed a Russian citizen," said Lysenko.

The threat will cause deep concern in the West and comes amid reports of residents fleeing the city of Donetsk amid fears of a major battle between Ukrainian troops and rebels.

Moscow is considering 'surgical retaliatory strikes' on the Ukrainian territory following claims that people in Russia were killed and wounded after being struck by shells from across the border.

'Our patience is not boundless,' a source told Kommersant newspaper, owned by Arsenal Football Club shareholder Alisher Usmanov.

'This means not a massive action but exclusively targeted single strikes on positions from which the Russian territory is fired at.'

The Russian side 'knows for sure the site where the fire comes from', said the source. ,

The proposed plan echoes a statement by a deputy speaker of Russia's upper house, Yevgeniy Bushmin, who told RIA Novosti news agency that using precision weapons in response to Ukraine's shelling would prevent further Kiev's attacks of Russian territory.

'There is a feeling that if before firing was not aimed against Russian border guards, now provocations have been on the rise as there is no other means of forcing us to join in the standoff with Ukraine's security troops,' he said.

'The only way to fight against this like civilised countries do, namely the US and the EU. We should use precision weapons, like Israel, to destroy those who fired this shell.'

Ukraine claimed that the attack was staged by pro-Moscow rebels, denying any involvement by its armed forces.

One Russian citizen was reported killed when a shell exploded in a yard of a house in a small border town also called Donetsk, the same name as the Ukrainian city.

Another shell hit a house, injuring two women, a 82-year-old mother and her daughter. The elderly woman was hospitalised with concussion and fractures.

Meanwhile there were reports that rebels have started using a Sukhoi Su-25 attack aircraft - their first warplane - against Ukrainian forces.

Today's threat from the Kremlin followed a warning on Sunday by the Russian foreign ministry of 'irreversible consequences' from the border 'attack'.

Moscow deemed it 'an extremely dangerous escalation' .

Kiev claims that Moscow is arming rebels with Grad multiple-rocket system, and alleged any shooting across the Ukraine-Russian frontier was by insurgent fighters and not its armed forces.

The Kremlin allegation was 'total nonsense', it claimed.

Moscow earlier appeared to pull back tens of thousands of troops close to the border amid fears it could invade eastern Ukraine.

The Russian senate also rescinded permission for Vladimir Putin to deploy forces in Ukraine.
