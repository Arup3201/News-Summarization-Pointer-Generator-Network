Sleeping soundly beneath eye masks and blankets, Eurocrats make the 270-mile train journey from Belgium to France in a  farcical monthly move between the European Parliament’s  two headquarters.

Nicknamed the gravy train or the Eurocrat Express, two privately-chartered trains shuttle 1,000 parliament staff from its main seat in Brussels to its ‘official’ home in Strasbourg for just four days a month.

An estimated 360,000 man hours are lost every year when 3,000 staff and 766 MEPs relocate en masse to Strasbourg by car, train and plane.

The wasted hours are no more apparent than on board one of the two plush trains, which are exclusively chartered for parliamentary staff for half a million pounds a year.

After the four-hour train journey, most of the highly-paid Eurocrats will not arrive at parliament until almost 3pm, when they will finally begin working.

Just 72 hours later, they board a train home – having worked just two full days in France – while their documents and a fleet of cars are returned to Brussels.

This second home costs taxpayers an estimated £150million annually, despite being deserted for 85 per cent of the year.

During ‘Strasbourg week’, 2,500 trunks of documents are moved across the border in lorries at a cost of £250,000, and a fleet of black Mercedes are taken on transporters so they are waiting for MEPs when they arrive.

Staff are put up in expensive hotels, which double in price when parliament is sitting, and receive generous expenses during their visit.

The high-speed private train service, which boasts luxurious red velvet seats, was introduced in 2008 by President Nicolas Sarkozy.

Senior officials who do not take the ‘train special’, as it is called, are able to use a privately-chartered jet which runs twice a week or a chauffeur-driven Mercedes.

MEPs voted three to one in favour of having just one parliament building in October last year. But the vote was fruitless because the Strasbourg agreement is written into the 1992 European Treaty.

The governments for all of the 28 member countries must agree to any change in the treaty.

France has made it clear that it would veto any such amendment – as Strasbourg rakes in an  estimated £17million a year for the French economy. Roger Helmer, Ukip MEP for the East Midlands, said: ‘Anyone can see that it is completely mad to have two headquarters instead of one at a cost of tens of millions of pounds a year.

‘But we will never be able to change it because it is written in the treaty and France will veto it every time. It stands as a metaphor for the whole European project which is full of things nobody can explain, that nobody can justify but, ultimately, that nobody can change.’

Ashley Fox, Conservative MEP for the South-West, said: ‘Hours and hours of people’s lives are going down the plughole each month travelling there.

‘It is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the EU. It duplicates an existing parliament, it achieves precisely nothing and it wastes money.

‘It is ridiculous that we only sit here for 48 days a year and yet there are 100 members of staff who are working full-time as cleaners, in security and in catering awaiting our return.

‘The lights are left on, the building is heated, the floors are cleaned – all for no one.’

But French MEP Alain Cadec said: ‘It is true that the majority of MEPs are opposed to this, but it is not them who get to decide, it is the governments.’

Plus, he added with a smile, ‘I live in Brittany so it is very convenient for me’.
