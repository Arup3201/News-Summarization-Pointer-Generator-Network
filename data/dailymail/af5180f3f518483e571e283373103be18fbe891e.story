It's World Cup final day in Brazil, and against all the hopes of the host nation, the fans most out in force are the Argentinians. The Copacabana beach has been taken over by a sea of blue and white with thousands of neighbours driving over the boarder to enjoy the atmosphere.

They'll be hoping for their first World Cup victory in 28 years, while the Germans have to go back 24 for their last win, against Diego Maradona's Argentina in Italy.

The German fans are struggling to make themselves heard at the moment, but Joachim Low's army will surely be making a racket if the final begins anything like their 7-1 victory over Brazil.
