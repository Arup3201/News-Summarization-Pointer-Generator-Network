Sunseekers on Italy's Isola del Giglio look on as salvage crews begin the mammoth task of refloating the Costa Concordia - almost half a year after the stricken vessel capsized off the Tuscan coast.

Engineers yesterday moved a salvage rig - the Titan-Micoperi - into place next to the luxury cruise liner, which capsized in January, when it struck an 80-ton rock that lay 
within a submerged reef.

The operation to refloat the 114,000-ton 
liner and tow her away will take one year to complete in what has been described 
as an 'unprecedented' procedure. It is expected to cost more than $300million (£190million).

But it hasn't put holidaymakers off visiting the idyllic island. As temperatures reached 28 degrees Celsius today, sunbathers stripped down and swam in the Tyrrhenian sea - just yards from the salvage operation.

A
 cage will be built around the Concordia and then barges with cranes 
will be brought in and anchored to the sea bed to help straighten and 
refloat the massive 290metre-long ship.

Once upright, it will be towed to a dry dock where it is expected to be scrapped.

It emerged last week that
 the massive rock lodged into her side will be removed and turned into a
 memorial to the 32 people who lost their lives on the ill-fated vessel.

Captain Francesco Schettino is 
accused of altering the course of the ship so that it sailed close to 
the picturesque coast in a bid to impress passengers and crew, as well 
as locals waiting on a nearby island.

But the liner instead sailed straight
 into the path of the rock, which tore a 70-metre hole into the side of 
the Costa Concordia's hull before becoming lodged inside the vessel.

More than 4,000 holidaymakers and 
crew were on board when the disaster struck just three hours after the 
ship left port for the start of a Mediterranean cruise on January 13.

At
 the time, coastguards said they had 'never seen' anything like it and 
described the lodged rock as 'unique in maritime history'.

Under house arrest: Captain Francesco Schettino is accused of causing the shipwreck, among other charges

Sergio
 Ortelli, mayor of Giglio, confirmed £40,000 will be spent to remove the
 rock as part of the judicial investigation into the tragedy and it will
 later be turned into a 'fitting' memorial.

He said: 'The Costa Cruises company has said this is what they want to happen and it is also what we want to happen.

'It will be removed and turned into a memorial of some sorts so that the island can pay tribute to those who lost their lives.

'We
 have no idea yet where it will be positioned, but most likely it will 
be close to the harbour entrance so that visitors and locals can see it 
clearly and pay their respects to the victims.

'What happened that night is something Giglio will never forget and the rock will be a fitting memorial.'

Prosecutors have launched an investigation into Mr Schettino's actions, who is currently under house arrest.

He has been charged with causing a 
shipwreck, multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and failing to inform 
maritime authorities of the situation.

It is claimed that Mr Schettino delayed the order to abandon ship for more than an hour.

This
 meant that by the time the lifeboats were launched, it was already too 
late to use them because of the angle of the Concordia.

Many passengers and crew had to make their way down the hull on rope ladders instead.

Witnesses
 have told prosecutors that Mr Schettino was in a lifeboat when at least
 300 people were still on board and needed to be rescued.

This
 allegation has led to claims of cowardice against the captain, as he 
saved himself instead of following the maritime tradition of staying at 
his post as late as possible.

The Costa Concordia lies aground in front of the Isola del Giglio on January 23, ten days after the disaster unfolded

People
 living in Giglio want the ship removed as quickly as possible and 
without any lasting environmental impact to the the area.

The
 coast is a protected maritime park and boasts a strong population of  
whales, porpoises and dolphins. The island's beaches are also a popular 
attraction for thousands of tourists every summer who flock to Giglio.

Earlier
 this year, salvage teams pumped off 2,380 tonnes of heavy duty diesel 
that remained in the ship's fuel tanks, in a round-the-clock operation 
lasting five weeks.

Mr 
Schettino is currently under house arrest at his home in Meta di 
Sorrento, near Naples. His trial is set to resume next month.
