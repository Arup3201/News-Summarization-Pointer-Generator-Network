The Champions League group stage reached the half-way point this week with a series of entertaining and goal-laden matches.

We cast our eye over the eight groups to see who's cruising through and who still has work to do in order to reach the knockout stage.

GROUP A

Italian champions Juventus have work to do if they are to avoid a repeat of last season's group stage exit.

Their 1-0 defeat by Olympiacos on Wednesday night leaves them third in the group and heaps pressure on Massimiliano Allegri's side to get a result in the return match in Turin the week after next.

The Greeks have looked strong at home and that has been enough to offset a 2-0 loss in Malmo and put them top of the group at the midway stage.

Spanish champions and last season's runners-up Atletico Madrid lost in Greece on the opening matchday but back-to-back home victories have put them in a strong position.

You would still back them and Juventus to advance, however.

 GROUP B

Real Madrid's masterful performance on Merseyside has put them on the brink of qualification for the knockout stages with three wins from three.

The defending champions beat Basle 5-1 at the Bernabeu on matchday one and then recovered from an early scare to beat Ludogorets Razgrad 2-1 in Bulgaria.

A win against Liverpool in the return match on November 4 will seal their progress.

The Bulgarian debutants are actually second on goal difference following their 1-0 success over Basle this week, while Liverpool in third place and Basle in fourth also have three points.

Liverpool's match with Basle at Anfield on matchday six still looks like being the decisive tie.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid have a 100 per cent record in Group B and are favourites to advance

GROUP C

All to play for in Group C as Bayer Leverkusen, Monaco and Zenit St Petersburg battle for the two qualification slots.

The German side seized top spot with their 2-0 win over Zenit on matchday three, while Monaco are second despite two drab goalless draws.

In an open group, it looks as though Benfica are the fall guys, but that could change if they beat Monaco in the next round of fixtures.

GROUP D

Borussia Dortmund have raced away in this group, with Arsenal the favourites to join them following Wednesday night's dramatic late turnaround against Anderlecht.

The German team have defied their poor league form to win all three matches so far, racking up nine goals without conceding.

They will ensure their place in the last 16 if they complete the double over Galatasaray on matchday four.

Lukas Podolski's late winner in Brussels has completely changed Arsenal's outlook and a win over Anderlecht at the Emirates in two weeks will put them in a very strong position.

As a result of Wednesday's results, Anderlecht and Galatasaray are left scrapping for the Europa League consolation prize.

GROUP E

Bayern Munich are cruising to top spot in Group E with their incredible 7-1 win in Rome opening up a five-point cushion at the top.

Three points in the return match with Roma at the Allianz Arena in two weeks will ensure their progress and it is then a shoot-out between the Italians and Manchester City as to who will follow them.

City, who surrendered a two-goal lead against CSKA Moscow on Tuesday, ideally need maximum points from their next two home games to advance.

It is likely they will need to go to the Stadio Olimpico and get something on matchday six.

GROUP F

Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona look favourites to advance from this group, as was expected.

The French champions stayed in top spot after their 1-0 win over APOEL in Cyprus this week and Barceona beat Ajax 3-1 to damage the Dutch challenge.

If Lionel Messi and co can avoid defeat in the Amsterdam ArenA on matchday four, they will be pretty much there.

APOEL and Ajax have yet to win in the group stage and will contest the Europa League spot.

GROUP G

Chelsea are in a strong position to advance as winners of Group G and a win in Slovenia against Maribor will pretty much ensure top spot.

Schalke, who edged out Sporting Lisbon in a dramatic 4-3 win on Tuesday, are favourities to follow them and remain unbeaten.

Maribor still have an outside chance while Sporting look down and out.

GROUP H

Plenty still to play for in Group H with Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk and BATE Borisov all in with a shout.

Shakhtar's 7-0 rout of BATE on Tuesday has put them second behind the Portuguese side and both looks well-placed to make it through.

Bilbao's return to Europe's top competition has been a let-down, with a draw and two defeats so far.

Porto are sitting pretty at the top of Group H, with seven points from a possible nine
