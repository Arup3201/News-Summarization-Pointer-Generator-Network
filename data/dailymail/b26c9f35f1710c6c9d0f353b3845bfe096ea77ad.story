England fans may dream of turning Wembley Stadium into a fortress but Trafalgar Square belonged to the Tartan Army yesterday.

Up to 4,000 good-natured travelling football fans transformed the London landmark into a blistering cauldron of Scottish jingoism.

But there was disappointment in the evening for the supporters when their team lost 3-2 in North-West London, with England debutant Rickie Lambert scoring the winner.

Ahead of the big clash however, a 
sprawling crowd gathered at the base of Nelson’s Column, clad in a 
uniform of heavy boots, kilts and football shirts.

Brandishing
inflatable swords, Saltire flags and ginger wigs, many chanted ‘there’s
only one William Wallace’ to the sound of bagpipes.

Just
hours before the celebrations began stern-faced local council officials
insisted that the square’s alcohol ban would remain in place.

But
any plans to enforce it were quickly abandoned as a throng of Scots 
appeared on the horizon before most pubs had even opened bearing crates 
of lager and cider.

By the time kick-off arrived, the square was a ruin, the ground carpeted with smashed bottles, squashed cans and abandoned bags.

Its famous fountains were left hidden beneath foam after the water was filled with washing up liquid.

The first ‘Auld Enemy’ clash for 14 years was peppered with politics, as some took the opportunity to campaign for devolution.

One Saltire flag was emblazoned with the words ‘General Salmond’s Ultras’, a reference to the hardcore hooligan elements of some European clubs.

Other fans stuck posters bearing the word ‘Yes’ in a bright blue font on two of the four lions that guard the square.

Their efforts were part of the fervent pro-independence campaign, backed by Alex Salmond’s Scottish National Party.

But there could be no greater advert for Scottish pride than the mass of up to 25,000 sports fans who travelled south of the border for the anniversary match.

A sure fire symbol that something is unusual in London comes when black cab drivers slow down to take pictures with their iPhones.

Yesterday, there was a queue of cabbies gazing in astonishment at the heaving number of Scots in Trafalgar Square.

'Murray is ours! Murray is ours! You've got Tim Henman, but Murray is ours!'

Scottish chant

They began to arrive shortly after 9am and by noon, the fountains were full of bare-chested men and the bagpipers in full flow.

As the day wore on the fans became more sunburnt and less inhibited as they danced the conga and performed chaotic Mexican waves.

Scottish flags were draped across statues and one group even attempted to inflate a small castle as footballs bounced above the crowd.

As a bagpipe player entertained the crowd, one group of fans sang: ‘Murray is ours! Murray is ours! You’ve got Tim Henman, but Murray is ours!’

Others chanted ‘There’s only one 
William Wallace’, a reference to the 13th century Scottish warrior, 
portrayed by Mel Gibson in Braveheart, who led the Scots in the First 
War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. 

Amid the sea of blue and white, one presumably lost schoolboy unfurled an England flag next to one of the Square’s statues.

He quickly pulled it down when it triggered a mass chant of ‘What the f****** hell is that?’ from a sea of astonished faces.

'It all comes out at an event like this. And you can’t blame us. We've certainly been waiting a long time for it'

Jonny McIntosh, Scotland fan

Sporting a traditional Glengarry hat, oil worker Jonny McIntosh, from Aberdeen, said the singing was good natured.

‘It all comes out at an event like this,’ he said. ‘And you can’t blame us. We’ve certainly been waiting a long time for it.’

A short distance away, Michael Connell, 
48, who travelled down with fans from West Lothian, described the match 
itself as ‘90 minutes of inconvenience’.

Stating the obvious, he added: ‘We are passionate and we like to party.’

Wearing
a woven ‘proud to be Scottish’ badge, Roscoe Hendrie, 67, arrived 
carrying a flag bearing an image of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.

The retired engineer said fans were driven by ‘Scottish passion’ and the ‘spirit of Andy Murray’.

Police from both sides of the border mounted a significant operation to ensure the match was trouble free.

A
dozen specialist intelligence staff joined colleagues from the 
Metropolitan Police in a bid to identify any notorious troublemakers.

The
ugly scenes which erupted when 100,000 Rangers fans descended on 
Manchester for the Uefa cup final in 2008 remain fresh in their minds.

On that occasion more than 40 people were arrested and hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage caused when fighting broke out after a big screen failed.

Yesterday, there was only one arrest at Trafalgar Square of a drunken 23-year-old man for dancing naked in one of the fountains.

And there were two more arrests at the game itself - one for drunkenness and the other for public order offences, a Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline.

Shortly before 5pm, two football fans fell from a statue and smashed into the ground. Paramedics took one man, aged in his 40s, to hospital with a serious head injury and back pain.

A second man, who was less seriously injured, was also taken to hospital for treatment to a head wound.

Four others were treated in the square for minor injuries, including a sprained ankle and several head injuries when people were hit by flying debris.

At the stadium itself, police designated 11 pubs to the East for Scottish fans and 12 to the West for English fans.

England v Scotland is the oldest international fixture in the world, with the first match in 1872 in Glasgow finishing goalless.

The teams have played each other on 110 occasions - England with 45 wins to Scotland’s 41. Scotland won the last meeting 1-0 at Wembley in November 1999.
