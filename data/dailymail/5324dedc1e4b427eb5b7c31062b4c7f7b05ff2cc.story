Saturday's RBS Six Nations clash between Wales and Ireland will be played under an open roof at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

Wales assistant coach Rob Howley confirmed during a press conference on Thursday that the roof would be open.

Even if Ireland had wanted the roof closed, it now makes no difference.

If there is disagreement between the teams, then the roof stays open. It can be only closed if both sides agree.

During Warren Gatland's coaching regime, Wales have consistently preferred a closed roof option, but that will not be the case this weekend.

'It's open,' Howley said.

'We've taken the decision it will be open. We wanted to know sooner, rather than later.

'The weather forecast is pretty good for the weekend, and it's something which we will look forward to.'
