With five minutes gone Sergio Aguero embarked on one of his thrilling mazy runs deep into Leicester territory only to be flattened on the edge of the area. By David Silva.

If Gary Neville was watching, he may well have given a knowing nod.

The former Manchester United star spoke at length in the build up to this match about how City are unbalanced in a 4-4-2 when they play Aguero, Silva and Yaya Toure.

Silva proved his point - literally - sending the Argentine tumbling to the floor before many had even taken their seats.

Neville's wider point was that the trio - breathtaking when on the front foot but seemingly out of breath when asked to defend - are a luxury Manuel Pellegrini can ill afford when up against the cream of Europe.

With all due respect to Leicester they are not the cream of Europe, rather the dregs of the Premier League, but they proved his point more than once at a pancake-flat Etihad.

From the kick-off Toure wandered into the visitors' half. It was where he would spend most of the match.

The Ivorian's lack of an appetite for hard work did not go unnoticed among the blue-collar faithful.

After one run, in which he was felled on the edge of the box but failed to win a free-kick, he stayed down for what seemed like an eternity.

By the time he got up, Leicester were on the attack in the City half.

It was all too much for one punter in front of the press box who wasted no time in getting to his feet.

'Get up you lazy g**' was his frustrated shout. Nobody told him to shut up.

Against cellar dweller opponents who have four wins from 26 attempts it was unimpressive stuff and perhaps an indication of why, before this encounter, City had just nine points from a possible 21 in the Premier League.

It would be remiss, however, to deny that when it works (and it has won them two titles) it works well.

For the opener, Toure's surging run ended with a pass to Silva in space. His flick found an overlapping Aleks Kolarov and after some ping pong in the Leicester box Silva prodded home.

Silva also lofted two delightful balls over the visitors' defence, one for a misfiring Wilfried Bony and one for Sergio Aguero. Both strikers put their efforts over the bar but it would be very difficult for any manager to drop the graceful Spaniard.

Neville's point, however, was reaffirmed on 74 minutes. At 1-0, Nigel Pearson's plucky visitors should not have been in with a sniff. But in the midst of host of missed opportunities for the home side Riyad Mahrez hit a post.

Had that gone in it could have been title race over.

As it turned out, sub James Milner made it 2-0 after Silva had been replaced by Frank Lampard.

Better opposition, however, would have reinforced Neville's point even further.
