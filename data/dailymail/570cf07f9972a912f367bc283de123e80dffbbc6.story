Widnes have handed centre Chris Dean a new three-year contract after an impressive Super League campaign in 2014.

The 26-year-old former St Helens and Wakefield player had another 12 months left to run on his existing deal but Vikings head coach Denis Betts was keen to tie him up for longer.

Betts said: 'Chris is an outstanding individual and is a great bloke to have around the place.
