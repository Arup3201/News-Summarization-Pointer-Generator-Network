An Emmy-winning TV writer died in a tragic accident in Brooklyn yesterday when a pick-up truck jumped the curb and pinned her against a wall.

Martha Atwater, 48, had just bought cookies from a cafe in Brooklyn Heights when a black Honda Ridgeline careered onto the sidewalk.

Witnesses have described emotionally distressing scenes as the woman spoke final words to her family using her cell phone. 

The truck was driven by a 53-year-old man who remained at the scene. Reports say he may have lost consciousness and control of the vehicle due suffering a 'medical problem', possibly related to diabetes. Authorities are not suspecting criminal behavior.

The incident happened on Clinton Street and Atlantic Avenue around 5.40 pm on Friday.

Atwater was barely conscious when paramedics arrived at the scene and she was taken to Long Island College Hospital.

She was pronounced dead at the hospital and identified by husband Thomas Wallack.

Wallack returned to the family home last night but according to The New York Post was 'too distraught to speak.' 

Amille Harris, an eyewitness, told ABC that a UPS worker got Atwater's phone and was able to call her family.

Harris added that it was distressing to watch her last words to her family. 'She was just mumbling and whining. There was nothing she could do it was sad,' Harris said.

'She was pinned under the car. There was no blood, nothing she could do. Her leg was caught under the tire. It was gory,' Harris recalled.

Atwater bought five horseshoe-shaped cookies from the Bagel Cafe before being struck by the truck.

The cafe manager Alauddin Shipun told The New York Post: 'She just came in to buy cookies. She looked happy, she was smiling.'

'She walked out. I heard a big bang and she was gone. Someone was trying
to lift her head up and asking her, "Are you OK? Are you OK?"' Shipun 
added.

Atwater graduated from Princeton University and won an Emmy award in 2009 for her work on PBS children's show WordWorld.

She also wrote for Big and Small and Horrible Histories, and produced the series Clifford the Big Red Dog and film Clifford's Really Big Movie.

The Brooklyn Heights Blog reported that Atwater was an active member of the community. She wrote a blog called Desperately Seeking Jon Stewart.
