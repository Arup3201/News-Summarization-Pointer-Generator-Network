The family of a Georgia mom fears for her safety as she hasn't been seen or heard from since leaving a Walmart in September.

Tiffany Michelle Whitton, a 27-year-old mother of a young girl, was last seen leaving a Walmart on Cobb Parkway in Marietta on September 13 of last year.

Whitton, who once had a very strong presence on social media, hasn't updated her Facebook page since September 1.

'She really has kind of disappeared without a trace,' Marietta Police Department spokesman David Baldwin told CBS News Atlanta. 'Nobody has spoken to her, seen her, and there have been no phone 
calls.'

Her family has setup a Facebook page dedicated to finding the young mother, who identifies herself on Facebook as a 'former Hooters girl.'

'My daughter, Tiffany Whitton, has been missing since September 12, 2013. The police are involved but we need leads in order to find her. She has many friends and family members, all of whom are very worried and want to find her,' a message posted on the page says. 'We have no idea if she is missing because she chooses to be or if her safety is in jeopardy. All we do know is where she was last seen and that we want desperately to find her. If you have seen her or have any information as to her whereabouts, please send me a message on this page or contact Marietta Police at 770-794-5325. Thank you for your prayers and your support. We greatly appreciate all of you!'

Baldwin says the investigation is a priority for authorities, and that Whitton's family - especially her young daughter - deserve to know what happened to her.

'That's probably one of the most concerning points is the fact that she does have a small child,' said Baldwin.

In 2011, Whitton was charged with robbery, burglary (forced entry, residence), possession and use of drug-related objects, and giving false name/address/DOB to a law enforcement officer for an alleged home invasion authorities suspected was over a drug-deal-gone-wrong.

According to Chattanooga.com, Whitton and several others went to a home in Dalton and kicked down the door as one of the alleged victims ran and hid in a bathroom.Â 

The victim's husband told authorities that after the group broke into the house, he witnessed a male suspect banging on the bathroom door with a tire iron as the man's wife was hiding inside and on the phone with police.

When the suspects realized police had been called they left the house, but took the victim's purse.

Both witnesses knew Whitton and identified her as one of the people who broke into her home.

Following her arrest, Whitton told authorities that the victim had stolen $60 from her earlier in the day and that she and the others had gone to the victim's house to get the money back.

Whitton told detectives that the money was stolen from her when she met the victim at a WalMart and the two chatted in her car.

Authorities suspected that the $60 was part of a drug deal for pills that were never delivered.

Whitton is described as being 5-foot-2, 100 pounds with green eyes and blonde hair that she frequently dyes different colors. She has several tattoos, including Chinese symbols on her left wrist and a butterfly on her hip.
