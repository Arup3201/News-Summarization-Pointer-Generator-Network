Anna Buckland was so terrified when her house was ransacked by burglars for the second time she went blind with fear

A woman was so terrified when her house was ransacked by burglars for the second time she went blind with fear.

Anna Buckland, 57, cowered behind an ironing board in her kitchen when she heard Ryan Lewis smash his way into her home.

Despite her terror, she called police who burst into the house and caught Lewis, 32.

Ms Buckland's soaring blood pressure made her lose her sight and she has only just regained it two months later.

Speaking after Lewis was jailed for three years, the former teacher said: 'I heard breaking glass. I was thinking it was outside, but it was quite loud.

'When I realised it was in my house, I froze - it was a big shock.

'I'm usually quite a confident person, but having to face up to maybe having to hurt somebody to protect myself was an awful experience.'

Lewis raided Ms Buckland's home in Tuffley, Gloucestershire, on August 22. He carefully knocked on the door to see if anyone was home but Ms Buckland did not hear it.

Despite hearing him shuffling through her home just metres from her hiding place, she was able to call police and direct them to her home.

She said: 'I was planning to escape through the garden, but then I turned my attention to catching him. If I could keep it together, we could get him.

'I could hear him coming right up close to the door I was hiding behind. There were times when I knew he was so close.

'I assumed he was there to burgle, and if I kept quiet, I would be okay. It was a massive relief when the police arrived.'

Chief Insp Richard Burge, of Gloucestershire Police, said: 'We knew there was someone in the house and needed to contain the situation as quickly as possible.

'Lewis admitted eight other offences. If we had not stopped him then, he would not have stopped.'

Lewis, of Gloucester, who was released from prison in June, asked for nine other offences to be taken into consideration at Gloucester Crown Court - including seven home burglaries.

He was jailed for three years and ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge.

Sudden blindness is a rapid onset of vision loss which usually occurs in one eye only. Sometimes known as amaurosis fugax, it can be caused by a wide variety of factors.

When people notice disturbances in their vision, they should consult an ophthalmologist immediately to get advice and treatment, as changes in someone's vision can be indicators of a stroke, dangerously high blood pressure, or another medical problem which requires immediate medical attention.
