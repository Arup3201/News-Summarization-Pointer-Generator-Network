A schoolgirl told President Obama that she was disappointed that her school's surprise guest was him and not her favourite popstar Beyonce. 

Obama and the First Lady made a surprise stop at a Washington, D.C., charter school yesterday to participate in a service project.

But his appearance caused much dismay to Madison, a sixth grader, who had hoped the surprise visitor would be Beyonce.

Madison tried to make up for it, telling the president, 'but then I realized it was going to be you and that's even better!'

But Obama wasn't buying it. 'I appreciate you saying that in front of the press,' he told her.

'I know it's not really true.'

The First Lady then joked: 'I'd rather see Beyonce,' before getting an amused glance from her husband. 

Last year Obama revealed that Sasha and Malia Obama are big fans of Beyonce and Jay Z.

'They love Jay Z. They love Beyonce. Sasha is still a One Direction fan, although I think Malia has become a little less into boy bands,' Mrs Obama said in a joint interview for People Magazine.

'They've gotten to know Beyonce, and she has always been very sweet to them,' Mr Obama added.

The singer has long been one of the President's most high profile supporters.

She wrote a letter of praise for him ahead of the US presidential election, in which she credited him with inspiring the future generation, including her own daughter.

Beyonce wrote: 'Every day we see your heart and character, inspiring us to give more of ourselves. You are the leader to take us from where we are to where we need to be.

She also sang at his inauguration in 2013.
