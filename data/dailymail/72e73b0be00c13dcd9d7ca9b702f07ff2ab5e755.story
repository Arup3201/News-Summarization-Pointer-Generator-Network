With the new school term about to start, thousands of parents will be frantically racing around the supermarket trying to find inspiration for their children's lunchboxes.

Opting for a balanced, hot school meal could help ease the pressure and give them the energy they need to get through the second half of the day.

But if you're going to choose a packed lunch, my rule of thumb is that is needs to be healthy and taste good. Getting that balance can be a real challenge.

One of the problems is that children get lunchbox envy - especially when their friends have tasty treats that they don't have

It's all too easy to get into the habit of giving your child a sandwich, a bag of crisps and a chocolate biscuit or cereal bar every day - but it's not necessarily a healthy combination.

One of the problems is that children get lunchbox envy - especially when their friends have tasty treats that they don't have.

The answer is to get creative and keep your family's lunches interesting, while packing in plenty of foods that contain the nutrients that children need.

Try and squeeze in at least two portions of fruit and vegetables into lunchboxes

•Try and squeeze in at least two portions of fruit and vegetables.

•   
Sandwiches are a brilliant for carbohydrates in the bread and protein 
in the filling, but keep it varied with bagels, stuffed pitta pockets 
and wraps.

•    You 
don't always have to play it safe with sandwiches. Carbohydrate-based 
salads such as pasta salad, rice salad, couscous, potato salad or 
tabbouleh are tasty and filling. Try egg-based foods as well, such as 
mini-quiche or frittata.

•   
Children often like food they can eat with their fingers, so chop up 
raw vegetables such as carrots or sweet peppers, and include houmous or 
cottage cheese to dip the veggies in.  Wrap them in damp kitchen paper 
to prevent them drying out.

•   
Cereal bars aren't necessarily a healthy alternative to chocolate bars 
and cakes, as some contain over 40 per cent sugar and 30 per cent fat. 
Instead, fill their boxes with fresh fruit, dried fruit or unsalted 
nuts. Try my wholesome muffin recipe, too.

•   
Try getting lunches prepared the night before to save you time in the 
morning. You can prepare pasta salads, sandwich fillings, or include 
leftovers from last night's dinner.

•   
Let your little ones help choose their favourite salad ingredients 
while on the weekly shop, and let them assemble it with you. If they can
say they were in charge of the meal from start to finish, they will be 
proud to take it to the table and for everyone to tuck in.

Kiddy sushi rolls

Ingredients

1 x 80 g tin (or ½ x 160g tin) tuna in sunflower oil

2 tbsp mayonnaise

1.5 tbsp tomato ketchup

2  drops of Tabasco, or to taste

2 slices white bread, crusts removed

2 in length of cucumber cut into strips

2 in length of carrot, coarsely grated 

Method

•    Using a rolling pin, flatten the bread until about 5 mm thick.

•    Mix the tuna together with one tablespoon of the mayonnaise and the tomato ketchup.

•   
Spread the remaining mayonnaise over the bread and then spoon the tuna 
about a quarter of an inch from the edge of the bread in a line.

•   
Arrange the cucumber strips on one side and the grated carrot on the 
other.  Roll up from the tuna end and press down to seal.  Trim ends to 
neaten using a sharp knife, then cut into three little rolls.

•    You can prepare this the night before, wrap in cling film and cut into three in the morning

Spanish Omelette

Ingredients

100g small new potatoes

1 tbsp olive oil

1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped

1 courgette, diced or grated

2 tomatoes, skinned, de-seeded and roughly chopped

4 eggs

1 tbsp milk

2 tbsp freshly grated parmesan cheese

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Method

•   
Bring a lightly salted saucepan of water to the boil, add the new 
potatoes, reduce the pan to a simmer and cook the potatoes for about 12 
minutes, until tender. Drain, leave to cool and then cut into slices.

•   
Heat the oil in an 18-20 cm non-stick frying pan. Add the onion and 
sauté for 2 minutes. Add the chopped courgette and sauté for about 6 
minutes.

•    When the courgette is cooked, add the tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes, then stir in the sliced new potatoes.

•   
Beat the eggs together with the milk, parmesan cheese and a little 
seasoning.  Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables and cook over a 
medium heat for about 4 minutes or until the eggs are set underneath.

•   
Meanwhile, preheat the grill to high. Place the frying pan under the 
grill with the handle sticking out if not metal and cook for about 3 
minutes until golden and set.

•    Take out and when the omelette is cold, cut into wedges and wrap in foil.
