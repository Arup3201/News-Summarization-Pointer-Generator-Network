Parents at Harley Avenue Primary School in Elwood New York, are outraged after the Kindergarten class's annual play was cancelled in order to get them 'college and career ready'.

Families received two letters sent home, in which interim Principal Ellen Best-Laimit explained the unpopular decision to cancel the show.

'The reason we are eliminating the Kindergarten show is simple. We are responsible for preparing children for college and career with valuable lifelong skills,' she wrote.

Show's over: Parents at Harley Avenue Primary School received two letters this spring, explaining why the annual Kindergarten play had been cancelled. Above, the second letter sent out last Friday

Taking away the music: Kindergartener Gabriela Solis says she was looking forward to singing in the show

Explanation: Interim Principal Ellen Best-Laimit (left in left picture) wrote that the show was cancelled in order to focus on making the 5-and 6-year-olds 'strong readers, writers, coworkers and problem solvers'. The school pictured on the right

Instead of preparing for the show, which was scheduled for mid-May, teachers will be focusing on molding the 5- and 6-year-olds into 'strong readers, writers, coworkers and problem solvers.'

The letter was signed by Best-Laimit and four kindergarten teachers.

Now parents at the school are fighting to bring the show back.

Ninette Solis, whose daughter Gabriela attends the school, started an online petition to reinstate the play and more than 1,600 have already signed it.

'These are 5-year-old children! This is outrageous! Canceling the show makes no sense at all,' Solis writes on the Change.org petition.

Her daughter Gabriela spoke to News 12 Long Island about her disappointment over the show's cancellation.

'I really like singing and I just really wanted to sing more,' little Gabriella said.

A spokesperson for the school told the local station that they believe the decision 'is in the best interest of the students'. 

Dear Kindergarten Parents and Guardians,We hope this letter serves to help you better understand how the demands of the 21st century are changing schools, and, more specifically, to clarify, misperceptions about the Kindergarten show. It is most important to keep in mind is [sic] that this issue is not unique to Elwood. Although the movement toward more rigorous learning standards has been in the national news for more than a decade, the changing face of education is beginning to feel unsettling for some people. What and how we teach is changing to meet the demands of a changing world.The reason for eliminating the Kindergarten show is simple. We are responsible for preparing children for college and career with valuable lifelong skills and know that we can best do that by having them become strong readers, writers, coworkers and problem solvers. Please do not fault us for making professional decisions that we know will never be able to please everyone. But know that we are making these decisions with the interests of all children in mind. Sincerely,Ellen Best-LaimitAngela CasanoKeri ColmoneStefanie GallagherMartha DeMartini
