A couple have spoken of their joy at bringing up a son whom they adopted after finding him abandoned in a New York subway station.

After the chance discovery of a day-old baby, they handed him over to the authorities - only for a judge to ask if they wanted to take him home with them.

And 12 years later, they were reunited with the judge who brought their family together when she presided at their wedding.

Discovery: Peter Mercurio, left, and Danny Stewart, right, found a baby abandoned on the subway

Danny Stewart was returning home to his partner Peter Mercurio in August 2000 when he made the discovery which would change his life, according to the New York Times.

He saw what he thought was a doll abandoned on a stairway in a New York subway station - but he soon realised it was in fact a tiny baby, so young his umbilical cord had not yet been cut off.

The social worker instantly called the police, and after a few minutes he panicked and phoned Mr Mercurio, shouting: 'I found a baby! I called 911, but I don't think they believed me.'

The couple waited together until the authorities came and took the child to safety, and Mr Stewart found minor fame when the local media reported that he had probably saved the baby's life.

In December that year, he was asked to appear in court to testify about how he found the boy, when and suddenly the judge asked, 'Would you be interested in adopting this baby?'

Mr Stewart instantly said yes - without consulting Mr Mercurio, who was initially furious but quickly realised that it might be the only way the couple could ever have a child.

Subway: The chance discovery led to the couple starting a new family and life together

When they were first allowed to hold the baby, they knew they could hardly bear to be apart from him again.

Mr Mercurio wrote: 'With the baby's eyes staring up at me, and all the innocence and hope he represented, I, like Danny, was completely hooked.'

The pair were unexpected given custody of the boy with just 36 hours' notice, and started their life together that Christmas.

Their new son, who was originally known as 'Baby ACE' because the station where he was found was on the A, C and E subway lines, was re-named Kevin.

The family had no contact with the judge who had brought them together until 2011, when they decided to wed after gay marriage was legalised in New York.

Kevin suggested that they should ask the same judge to officiate their wedding, so they contacted her through the court service and she said that she would be delighted to meet them again.

When they walked in to the court room, Kevin held out his hand to greet the woman who had given him his parents - but she insisted on hugging him instead.

Mr Mercurio wrote in the Times that they were all enjoying their catch-up so much they almost forgot to conduct the actual wedding ceremony.

The playwright has now turned his family's experiences into a film, entitled Found.
