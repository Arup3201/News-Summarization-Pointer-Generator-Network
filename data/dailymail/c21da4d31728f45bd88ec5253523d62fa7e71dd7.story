A mansion on a street dubbed Billionaires' Row was sold for £33.7million in December - 2,750 times more than the month's cheapest deal in Britain.

Eight-bedroom Jersey House, a 20,000 sq/ft new build located on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, north London, sold for the huge sum last month.

The stately home - on one of the capital's most exclusive streets - comes with an indoor swimming pool, staff accommodation and more than an acre of land.

Meanwhile a one-bed flat in the North East fetched just £12,250 at auction - the cheapest sale in Britain in December.

Splendid Jersey House has a reception hall with a 21-foot high ceiling, eight person lift and a dining room large enough to hold ten.

The master suite alone is spread over 1,800 sq/ft - twice the size of the average new home. 

Ten different types of marble were used in the construction of Jersey House, with the floors decked out in 'luxurious deep woven wool carpet'.

The mansion was originally put on the market for £39million, but was reduced last year to just under £35million.

It has now been sold for £33.7million, making it the most expensive sale of December and the third highest of the year.

This is considerably more than the £4.2million paid for the site back in 2001. Glentree International is thought to be the estate agency behind the deal.

Agency boss Trevor Abrahmsohn, whose total property sales on The Bishops Avenue totals £3billion, declined to comment.

The sale was logged with the Land Registry on December 5, the day after the controversial stamp duty changes were introduced.

If they managed to get the deal through before the changes were implemented, the buyer would have paid £2.35million in stamp duty, far less than £3.95million they would pay now.

The mammoth sale was 2,750 times more than the £12,250 paid for the one-bed flat in Washington, near Sunderland, which was originally offered for less than £10,000.

While the London property is a state-of-the-art 'turnkey' home, the Washington is one of a block of small flats.

It was bought at auction and boasts a bedroom, lounge, kitchen and bathroom.

The flat has a rental value of £313 a month, pennies compared to the £20,000 a month Jersey House would command.

The Land Registry's latest report says there were 1,132 homes sold for more than £1million in October - up from 984 in October 2013.

However, the recent stamp duty hike, a fear of a mansion tax and the election looming has prompted one industry expert to predict a drop in big sales.

Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'The million pound market was already slowing in the Autumn and whilst we wait for official figures I think this trend continued up to Christmas.

'Buying a property after George Osborne changed the stamp duty bands has become very expensive - enough to put some people completely off the idea of moving.

'In the first half of 2015 I expect sales of £1million homes to be just a fraction of what they were last year as small time developers retreat and even those end-users think twice about sitting down and playing big boy Monopoly.

'The second half of the decade looks like it will be very different from the first.

'The top end of the market is certainly pausing for breath. The question is whether it is gets a second wind.'

The average price of a home in England and Wales is now £177,766, which is a seven per cent year-on-year increase but still £3,500 lower than in 2008.

This is helped in part by London, where homes typically cost £464,936. The cheapest place to buy is the North East, where the average property is just £99,132.
