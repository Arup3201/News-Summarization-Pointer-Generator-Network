Southampton fans sang ‘We’re going to win the league’, and were only half joking after this victory. Manager Ronald Koeman encouraged their optimism, suggesting his side could be playing in the Champions League next season.

Victory propelled Southampton ahead of Premier League title holders Manchester City to second in the table, with 19 points from nine games. Their only hiccups so far have been a scoreless draw against West Bromwich Albion and away defeats by Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur.

Koeman said their league position, just four points behind leaders Chelsea, did not flatter his side. ‘You can make up your own mind, but up to now maybe we deserve more points,’ he said. ‘We lost at Liverpool when we deserved more, and maybe you can say the same when we lost at Tottenham.’

Koeman, who many thought would struggle to match Southampton’s eighth-placed finish under Mauricio Pochettino last season, thinks a top-four spot is eminently possible.

He said: ‘When I look at the other teams around the top four, City have a great team, Chelsea are probably the most complete side at the moment, but the rest of them have not shown that they have a better team than us.

‘Maybe there is an opportunity for us because Arsenal and Liverpool have a tough programme with Champions League football, but they do have 25 or 26 players in their squads who are all internationals.

Koeman had special praise for Toby Alderweireld who played a key role in Southampton's win over Stoke

‘We don’t have that luxury, maybe that is one difference between us.

Ronald Koeman’s new-look Southampton have won all five of their Premier League games in which they have scored first. 

‘It’s too early to say what we would like to win this season. When expectations are high, the best solution is to live day by day.

‘We enjoy being second in the table but it is only a start.’

Koeman said Southampton were no longer a surprise package after consistently proving themselves as an inventive but well-disciplined side, one that can put eight past Sunderland but has also conceded fewer goals than any other in the top four divisions.

The new signings Koeman made after the summer exodus again proved their worth. Senegal midfielder Sadio Mane, bought from Red Bull Salzburg for £11.8m in the summer, confidently scored from a rebound to put Southampton ahead after 33 minutes.

Mane, who had a strike against Sunderland harshly taken from him by the dubious goals panel, terrorised Phil Bardsley down the left flank before scoring his first official goal for Saints.

Again, Southampton were regimented at the back, proving they are not the meanest defence in the league by accident.

Koeman singled out Belgian loan signing Toby Alderweireld, who lifted the La Liga title with Atletico Madrid last season, for praise.

The Dutchman said Alderweireld was helping Southampton’s defence play like the best in the world.

‘He has been a strong influence - he has settled so well that it looks as if he has played in English football for two years already,’ said Koeman. ‘Last season he was playing for Atletico Madrid, who probably had the best defence in Europe, and before that he was at Ajax. He has learned a lot about the game at a high level.’

Mark Hughes, whose Stoke side were disappointing and missed a few chances to level in the second half, said Southampton were a good blueprint for other clubs.

‘If you look back over the years Southampton have spent big money on kids and that is why they are reaping the benefits of it,’ he said,

‘Stoke haven’t had the benefit of that but in the future, given the investment of (owners) the Coates family into the club we will get a return on that money without a shadow of a doubt, but it will take time.’
