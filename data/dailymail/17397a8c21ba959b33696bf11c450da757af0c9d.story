Rachel Riley signed up for Strictly Come Dancing as ‘a form of therapy’ to escape her broken marriage, friends close to the Countdown presenter have revealed.

Ms Riley has been reported to have grown close to her Strictly professional dance partner Pasha Kovalev, sparking jealousy from her husband of 16 months Jamie Gilbert.

But sources yesterday told The Mail on Sunday the marriage had been on the rocks before the show started and that Ms Riley, 27, used the intense work and training schedule as an excuse to avoid going home.

Dance diva: Rachel left Strictly after week six

'Final straw': The pair are thought to have spent a lot of time together, which left her husband Jamie Gilbert feeling jealous

A source close to the TV presenter 
revealed: ‘Rachel has kept the problems between her and Jamie quiet but 
really things have been finished for some time.

‘She
 had been throwing herself into work, and appearing on Strictly was a 
perfect opportunity to take her mind off problems at home.

‘Strictly was a sort of relaxation therapy to help deal with the split.’

Production
 sources on Strictly Come Dancing revealed that Ms Riley regularly 
complained about having to return to the marital home in Southend, Essex
 – accusing her husband of being untidy and saying she would prefer to 
be working.

16 months ago: The pair married last year having met at Oxford University. The ceremony was publicised in Hello! magazine

Ms Riley told 
the dance show’s producers she did not want to film scenes with her 
husband, despite other celebrities regularly inviting their families to 
appear on screen.

The TV 
source added: ‘It was quite clear things were finished before she even 
arrived on the first show – and Rachel didn’t do much to hide it behind 
the scenes. She wanted to take her mind away from everything at home. 
She got on well with Pasha but there was no romance there.

‘She
 was pretty vocal about how her marriage had gone stale and it seemed  
her husband was annoying her. She talked a lot about the messiness at 
home, which was a bone of contention.’

Ms
 Riley met Mr Gilbert when the pair were both studying at Oxford 
University. She announced their engagement on TV in 2011. Their wedding 
was publicised in a glossy photo shoot for Hello! magazine.

Yesterday,
 IT worker Mr Gilbert  was seen leaving their modest home  on a bicycle 
but he did not comment  on the split, which friends say has left him 
‘devastated’.

Meanwhile, Ms 
Riley’s career has gone from strength to strength since  joining Channel
 4’s Countdown, replacing Carol Vorderman in 2009.

Yesterday a spokesman for Ms Riley declined to comment on the split.
