Crimea annexed by the Kremlin, the rest of Ukraine at risk as Russian troops mass on its borders…

It is not as if the world’s leaders do not have enough real-life international problems to keep them busy.

Nevertheless, with the crisis deepening in the east, Barack Obama, David Cameron, Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping ended up playing a computer game dubbed  ‘nukes on the loose’ at a conference this week.

David Cameron and Barack Obama, along with other world leaders, played a game called nukes on the loose in which they were asked about their response to a fake nuclear crisis

Obama and Cameron were joined by other world leaders for the Nuclear Security Summit yesterday

The two-day summit was convened to discuss the threat nuclear weapons pose to the world

The war game, the brainchild of the Dutch hosts of the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) meeting in The Hague, revolves around a terrorist network planning to launch a ‘dirty bomb’ in a  high-profile financial centre.

‘It could be the City of London, or Wall Street, Milan or anywhere,’ the 53 world leaders at the NSS were told.

The game, split across four three-minute videos, involves terrorists stealing nuclear material from an unidentified country which has not properly secured its stockpile.

They use uranium to build a bomb which could kill millions of people if unleashed.

With the clock ticking, Mr Cameron and his fellow leaders – each playing the game on touch screen computers – had to figure out what to do.

Asked about the threat Russia poses to world security, Obama said he was more worried about a rogue attack

David Cameron held discussions with UN Secretary general Ban Ki Moon during the summit at the Hague

After each video, they made their decision from four options and the answers were shared anonymously with the group  for discussion.

The leaders were reported to have enjoyed the video game and President Obama even told delegates that the US regularly performs similar exercises.

He had America’s top adviser on weapons of mass destruction, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, at his side during the game but the other leaders were alone.

However, among all the excitable men, there was at least one  leader who raised an eyebrow at the proceedings.

German Chancellor Merkel was said to 
have been apprehensive taking part in a role-playing game about such a 
serious issue, especially alone, whereas in real life she would have 
advisers.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel was said to be slightly out of her depth during the video games because she was without her usual advisers

But while she normally plays hardball in negotiations, in this case she was talked around.

The
 summit’s Dutch organisers said it was the first time they had tried 
anything like this, but felt the ‘interactive approach’ was successful 
and the participants were ‘enthusiastic’.

NSS spokesman Frank Wassenaar said it was a ‘fictitious but realistic scenario’ and the right outcome was achieved by countries working together.

‘It was quite innovative and not the convention in a summit like this,’ he added. ‘Usually the leaders of delegations just make a statement. [But] the leaders debated freely.’

A diplomatic source told The Daily Telegraph that the nukes video game was actually a tough test for leaders.

‘It put them on the spot,’ said the source. ‘Should they inform the public or keep them in the dark? Should they work with other countries or stand alone to try to thwart the attack?  

The leaders were asked about whether they would keep the crisis private or go public, whether they would work together or stand alone, and how to bring the human cost down to an 'acceptable' level

‘How should they make the cold calculation of how to get a more sustainable human cost in terms of deaths?’

The video game has been compared to the 1983 Cold War thriller War Games, starring Matthew Broderick as a hacker who accesses a US military super-computer, nearly triggering a nuclear war.

A Downing Street source said: ‘The PM liked the interactive style and the fact that leaders were confronted with different events they had to respond to.’

The nukes game was played on Monday, the first day of the summit, which is aimed at discussing ways to protect the world from nuclear weapons.
