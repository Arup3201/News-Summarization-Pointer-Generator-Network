Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor's loan switch to West Ham fell through on transfer deadline day. 

The 30-year-old has failed to hold down a regular place under Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, and has scored just two goals in 15 appearances this season.

West Ham had been willing to offer the Togo striker a route out of White Hart Lane, but the proposed loan deal collapsed.

QPR were also interested in the Togolese forward but no deal took place on transfer deadline day

The east London club's co-owner David Gold earlier hinted at the deal, tweeting: 'Don't go to bed. dg'

But Gold later added: 'Sorry for keeping you up late but at the last moment the main deal collapsed and the rest folded like a pack of cards. Stay strong.

'I'd like to thank David Sullivan and Sam for their efforts too secure new players during this window.

'However no matter how hard you tried there are people out their that you just can't do business with. dg'

While Hammers boss Sam Allardyce has a number of strikers at his disposal, fitness concerns over some of them have forced him to take a look into the transfer market.

Club-record signing Andy Carroll picked up an ankle injury in the 2-0 defeat by Liverpool on Saturday and Allardyce is unwilling to let injuries halt the club's charge for a European place.
