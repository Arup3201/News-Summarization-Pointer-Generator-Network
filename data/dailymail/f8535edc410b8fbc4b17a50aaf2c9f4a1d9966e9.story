A stunning timelapse video of Melbourne's CBD showcases the many reasons why the city was crowned the world's most liveable for the fourth year in a row.

In a survey of 140 cities, Melbourne was ranked the gold medalist for healthcare, education, stability, culture and environment and infrastructure, and given an almost perfect score of 97.5 out of 100.

Melbourne-based photographer and videographer Daniel Johnson decided to celebrate the award by exploring the city once a week over five months, to capture the beautiful sights of the city he is proud to call his home.

Daniel took over 20,000 photographs to complete the project, visiting iconic landmarks and hidden alleyways to snap images of the city's landscape and create the amazing visual showpiece.

'After being nominated as the world’s most liveable city for the fourth year in a row, I thought what better subject to showcase in my new time-lapse short film than Melbourne itself,' said Daniel. 

'Growing up in Melbourne I always loved the city and its culture. Getting older and experiencing other cities has made me realise just how lucky I was to be born and raised in such a great city,'
