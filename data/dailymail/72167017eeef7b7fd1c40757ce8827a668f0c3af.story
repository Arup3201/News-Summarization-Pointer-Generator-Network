This is the map that shows the fastest growing cities in the country, according to a new report on GDP growth across metropolitan areas.

Cities in Texas and Indiana are booming largely thanks to a booming oil industry, but metropolitan areas of Louisiana are going backward as the petroleum industries in those areas slumped, the fascinating report released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Tuesday revealed.

Overall, real GDP in U.S. cities increased 2.5 per cent last year. This is up from an increase of 1.7 per cent on 2011.

The highest ranking cities for GDP growth were Midland, Texas, with a boom of 14.4 per cent, and Odessa, Texas with 14.1 per cent GDP growth.

Trade growth, both wholesale and retail, was widespread -- 363 of the nation's 381 metropolitan areas experienced positive contributions to growth -- and was the main reason Texas performed so well in 2012.

According to Dallasnews.com, a resurgence in the oil and gas industry in the Southwest specifically led to the strong growth.

Elkhart-Goshen, Indiana and Columbus, Indiana came third and fifth respectively on the list of fastest growing metropolitan areas, with overall real GDP growth of 11.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent.

The stellar performance in the Great Lakes was down to the manufacturing of durable goods, which continued to spur growth across the country.

Other booming cities in the top 10 include Bismark, North Dakota, New Orleans, Louisiana and San Francisco.

The highest ranking cities for GDP growth in 2012 was Midland, Texas, with a boom of 14.4 per cent

The three cities where GDP shrunk most in 2012 were Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana (-11.1 per cent), pictured, Lafayette, Lousiana (-8.1 per cent) and Hammond, LA (-5.0 per cent)

The financial sector also contributed strongly to the performance of many metropolitan areas.

However, not all cities did so well, and despite New Orleans' growth, others in Louisiana slumped.

The three cities where GDP shrunk most in 2012 were Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana (-11.1 per cent), Lafayette, Lousiana (-8.1 per cent) and Hammond, LA (-5.0 per cent).

According to The Advocate, a drop in crude oil and natural gas prices during 2012 may have been a factor in the drop in GDP in Lafayette and Shreveport. Lafayette has been boosted by activity in the offshore oil industry, while Shreveport has benefitted from natural gas drilling in the Haynesville Shale, but that activity has slowed because of low natural gas prices.

'Oil and gas is so important to Louisiana,' Walter J. Lane, chairman of the University of New Orleansâ€™ economics department, said. 'There's been a real boom and bust in Haynesville.'

Other cities on the poor performing ranking include Kennwick -Richland, Washington, Sierra Vista-Douglas, Arizona and Idaho Falls, Idaho.
