Southampton opened their doors to a remarkable £40million training facility on Wednesday, yet their main hope is that the scented massage rooms, bacteria-killing washing machines and ‘Black Box’ can, at the very least, match the talent-reaping brilliance achieved in the portacabins of their past.

Sportsmail was invited to a behind-the-scenes look at the new Marchwood facility, a stunning home to the brilliant minds and methods that have done so much to create one of the most celebrated production lines in British football.

‘Five years ago we had a single-storey brick building and cabins,’ said chairman Ralph Krueger.

Southampton's new training facility has been named after former owner Markus Liebherr who 'saved' the club from financial ruin

That was before the late Markus Liebherr pumped his money and thoughts into a club that had already nurtured Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott. Today, in a centre named after the German, the Premier League’s second-ranked club have a training centre that Martin Hunter, their technical director, hopes might yet produce enough homegrown players to fill half the first team.

Another aspiration, spoken by several at this club, is to see Southampton ultimately gatecrash the top four.

On arrival at this remote Hampshire base, the scale of the operation is obvious. There are nine training pitches, ranging from the 60x40-yard surface used by the Under eights to the one next to the pavilion that uses the same type of turf and matches the dimensions of the St Mary’s pitch.

‘Everything here is about progression,’ said Hunter. ‘The eight-year-olds want to get from that pitch to this one, right next to the pavilion. They start in small football, one v one, two v two. Concentrate on the game not the system.

The extensive gym and training areas will enable Southampton's players to work on their strength and fitness of the pitches

‘They learn the principles of attack and defend. The teams from Under 15 and up will have a flexible variant on 4-3-3 (as they do at Ajax’s famed academy), but the kids start with a ball and they learn to play, to think for themselves.

‘If they progress they go from the academy and Under 21 dining room to the first-team dining room.’

Cameras are next to the pitches – nine to be precise, with another 16 cameras on the way. ‘We want to have every view that might make us better,’ said Paul Mitchell, their head of recruitment.

The footage from those cameras is studied live by eight analysts, with a dedicated analyst for each of the Under 18 and Under 21 squads.

All those training on these pitches have already been scrutinised physically and mentally by the recruitment team and scouting group of four, led by Rod Ruddock, who was central to the discoveries of Bale and so many others. Their scouting network includes a further 30 ‘consultants’ out in the field.

Their latest tool is called the ‘Black Box’. It’s a two-tiered windowless room next to the analysis suite, with a huge touchscreen and viewing gallery. ‘It is our own software,’ Mitchell said. ‘I won’t tell you how much it cost because I’d rather other clubs did not know. In here, the manager will come to see what we have compiled on prospective new players.’

The software processes the vast information compiled on potential senior signings and junior recruits, from school grades to video clips. When the club rebuilt its decimated squad in the summer, many of Ronald Koeman’s final decisions were shaped in this room.

‘It is all about making up the small percentages,’ Hunter said.

It extends to the laundry room of kit man Mark Forde. ‘We spent 18 months researching the washing machines,’ he said. The amount of oxygen pumped into these specific machines has all but eliminated bacteria from kit. ‘It all helps keep the players healthy,’ Forde added. They are also known to bring bespoke mattresses to away matches.

Then there are the two massage rooms. ‘You can change the lighting, the smell and music – it is hard to measure the impact but, along with our psychology department, we want to see if they stimulate certain hormones,’ said Mo Gimpel, the sports science and medicine manager. ‘We want them to help a player relax on a recovery day or invigorate them on a hard training day.’ 

Arsenal ace Theo Walcott and Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale both graduated from Southampton's academy before moving on

England internationals Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Luke Shaw also progressed through the Saints academy before moving on

Gimpel’s department claim to have statistics from a UEFA audit that shows they are best ranked in the Premier League for injury prevention over the past two seasons.

In context, he estimates his department, that also studies the running patterns of the eight-year-olds, is half the size of that at Manchester City. To be achieving more than a club of such resources seems implausible.

‘The challenge now is staying ahead,’ said Gimpel. ‘It’s not just the young players here who have to progress. We have done well so far. You’d hope this magnificent facility adds a bit more. We want to punch above our weight.’

So far so good.
