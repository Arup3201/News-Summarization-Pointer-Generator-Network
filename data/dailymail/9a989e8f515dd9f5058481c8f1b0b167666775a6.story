The first of nine abandoned puppies named after characters from Downton Abbey has been adopted - by massive fans of the TV drama.

Josephine Smedley, her two daughters and her two-year-old grandson Ilias made the seven-hour, 330-mile round trip to collect Martha.

The family of Downton Abbey fans were looking to adopt a lurcher puppy as a companion for their eight-year-old lurcher Meg.

After hearing about the litter of abandoned puppies, Mrs Smedley and her husband Andy travelled to Southampton from their home in Toton, Nottingam, to collect their new pet.

Mother-of-four Mrs Smedley, 49, said: 'Of course we watch Downton Abbey - our family love all costume dramas.

'It’s a family ritual on Sunday evenings and we’ll all be gathering around the television this weekend to watch the show.

'I’m sure Martha will be watching her namesake in action.'

Her daughter Abby, 19, said the couple tried to contact Shirley Maclaine, who plays Martha Levinson in Downton.

She said: 'We even tried to contact the actress over Twitter but, sadly, we couldn’t find her anywhere.'

Martha Levinson is the mother of Cora, Countess of Grantham, and appeared in the second series of the award-winning drama.

The character caused a stir when she arrived at the stately home for the wedding of Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley.

She and the Dowager Countess regularly locked horns and Mrs Levinson was known for her strong opinions on the traditional aristocratic household.

The Smedley family’s application was one of 60 for the nine puppies which Southampton’s Blue Cross Rehoming Centre has received in the past week.

The litter was originally discovered abandoned and crying in a cardboard box in a park in Southampton, Hants, last Tuesday.

A woman out walking her dogs was shocked to discover the pups inside and brought them to the centre.

Staff there chose to name them all after Downton Abbey characters in the hope it would be popular with potential owners.

But they were shocked to receive an unprecedented amount of applications in just a week.

Mrs Smedley said: 'I liked the name Martha and we thought it went nicely with Meg.

'She looks exactly the same as Meg when we collected her from a rescue centre eight years ago and everyone will think they are mother and daughter.

'We have been looking to adopt a lurcher puppy for a while because we love their temperament.

'They’re loving, laid back dogs and they get on really well with kids. After we saw their picture in the paper we thought ‘yes, this is for us’.

The puppies were found abandoned in a cardboard box but have been nursed back to health

'We went out yesterday and bought her this great big bed which I know she’ll love.'

Rehoming supervisor Laura Boyle revealed that all the pups have now been reserved and will be going to their new homes in the coming weeks.

Ms Boyle said: 'It’s been an amazing response and many Downton fans have been in contact over Twitter following our news about the puppies.

The litter of puppies are called Earl and Cora, after the Earl and Countess of Grantham; Jim Carter's Carson; Laura Carmichael's Edith; Allen Leech's Tom and Sophie McShera's Daisy.

Ed Speelers' Jimmy and Matt Milne's Alfred are also represented.

'Over the weekend we had a lot of people come in and if they hadn’t reserved one they weren’t able to get in.

'It’s just been amazing. I haven’t even mentioned the phone calls we’ve had from people who enquired about their health to see how they’re getting on.

'Many of them even contributed to the charity too. We’ve never had so many applications in such a short space of time.

'Of them all, every customer liked Carson because he’s the confident one out of the litter.'
