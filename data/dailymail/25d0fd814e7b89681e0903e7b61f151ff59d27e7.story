It’s more sky-high than Skyfall.

But James Bond’s favourite car-maker has taken an Aston Martin to new heights with a dramatic daredevil stunt to celebrate the car-maker’s 100th anniversary.

The audacious event saw the airlift of Aston Martin’s ultimate grand tourer - the Vanquish -  onto the helipad at the luxurious Burj Al Arab hotel - the world's fourth tallest - in Dubai.

It’s the first time a car
has been placed onto the helipad, which sits 1,000ft above the ground 
at the top of the sail-shaped building.

Aston
Martin chief executive Dr Ulrich Bez said: ‘It is with great pride that
we continue our centenary celebrations in such a unique manner in the 
city of Dubai.

'We have 
achieved another world first – one of many for Aston Martin over the 
years. This is a true feat for Aston Martin and a fantastic way to begin
a new century of global success for our iconic brand.'

He
said: 'Aston Martin remains one of the most exclusive and sought-after 
brands in the world, so it is only right that a key element of our 
year-long centenary celebrations takes place in a similarly high profile
destination.'

British Ambassador to the UAE Dominic Jermey said: 'Aston Martin is one of the world’s most iconic automotive brands.

'I
cannot think of a more spectacular or fitting way for this great 
British tradition to mark its one hundredth anniversary, particularly in
this city that is so passionate for luxury and bespoke brands.'   

The Aston martin Airlift comes just days after the firm’s centenary was celebrated in London.

The
events in London and Dubai mark the start of a year-long celebration of
all things Aston Martin, with events taking place worldwide over the 
next 12 months.

James Bond's favourite: Daniel Craig with another classic Aston Martin model in the latest thriller Skyfall

Classic: The Aston Martin DB5 which appeared in the 1964 Bond film Goldfinger

Trailblazer: The second prototype of the Aston Martin 'Coal Scuttle' in 1920 which won plaudits for its innovative design

Powerful: A DB4 model from 1961 which was the first Aston to be manufactured at the company's works in Buckinghamshire

History: Heritage Trust Roger Carey (left) and Aston Martin Chairman David Richards (right) by a new plaque to mark the place where Aston Martin cars were first manufactured

Aston Martin was founded 100 years ago today by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford.

Their company Bamford & Martin later became Aston Martin, acknowledging Bamford's success at the Aston Clinton Hillclimb in Buckinghamshire, where he had successfully raced their very first cars.

The centenary ceremony took place at 16 Henniker Mews, off Callow Street, Brompton, London, SW3 6BL where Bamford and Martin, which later went on to become Aston Martin Ltd was incorporated on  15 January 1913.

Among those taking part were Aston Martin chairman David Richards and Roger Carey, chairman of the Aston Martin Heritage Trust (AMHT) as well as the firm’s  directors and leading members of the Aston Martin Owners Club.

The anniversary also comes at a fitting time for Bond fans as 007 picks up screen honours and is short-listed for a number of Oscars.
