No-one could accuse the BBC’s cult political show of not getting into the festive spirit.

As Andrew Neil hosted the Christmas special of last night’s edition of This Week, he donned an extraordinary festive jumper featuring a penguin.

And his guests Michael Portillo, Charles Kennedy, Tony Parsons and Diane Abbott joined in with the fun, as he branded them the ‘three wise men and a virgin mother of late night political chat’.

Broadcast live at 11.40pm, only the very dedicated political anoraks were doubtless still awake for the seasonal programme.

But the show has gained cult status with viewers who prefer it to the staid confrontational interviews of Newsnight or the shouting match that Question Time has become.

Neil began the programme joking about the decision by Sony Pictures to pull its controversial film The Interview, after threats from North Korea for its depiction of the assassination of Kim Jong-un.

He told viewers: ‘Welcome to out festive This Week special. Despite increasing pressure from Pyongyang to take us off the air we are broadcasting to you live from a bunker deep in the frozen grotto that is BBC current affairs.

‘For the next 45minutes we will be laughing hysterically in the face of idle North Korean threats and analysing the past, the present and the future of British politics.’

Then he turned to the bizarrely attired guests on the famous This Week purple sofas, describing them as ‘Christmas talent we managed to get on the cheap’.

They included regular panellists Michael Portillo, the former Tory Cabinet minister, and Diana Abbott, the one-time Labour leadership challenger.

Abbott wore a ribboned blue sweater and reindeer antlers, but was easily upstaged by Portillo who was wearing not just a jumper buy a festive jacket, trousers and matching tie

Ex-Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy had a green jumper which gave him the look of an elf while author and columnist Tony Parsons wore a red Christmas sweater and a flat cap.

Meanwhile author and columnist Tony Parsons wore a red Christmas sweater and a flat cap.

Neil declared: ‘In an uncharacteristic display of festive cheer, I am joined on the sofa tonight by four people who have travelled from afar, following a star to bear witness to my messiah complex.

‘Three wise men and a virgin mother of late night political chat,’ he added to laughter.
