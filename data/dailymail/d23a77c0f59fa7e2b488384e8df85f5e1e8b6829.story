Brooke Astor's son is allegedly trying out a new fraud as he was allegedly hawking a fake gold watch that he claimed belonged to his famous relative who died on the Titanic.

Anthony 'Tony' Marshall, who was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother Brooke Astor out of $60 million in 2009, and he and his current wife Charlene made a rare public appearance last week at a lavish party for a new cruise ship called the Titanic II.

At the party, he reportedly showed guests a gold watch that reportedly belonged to John Jacob Astor and was trying to sell it for $1million.

However, his story is claimed to be the 88-year-old's latest con, as a California collector has said that he bought the real watch in an auction over a decade ago.

'I wasn’t surprised. I had heard about
somebody who was claiming to have the Astor watch from the Titanic. He 
has a different watch,' collector John Miottel told the New York Post.

Marshall, 88, has been outcast by New 
York society since he was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother
Brooke Astor out of $60 million in 2009. He and wife Charlene have kept
to a frugal life of solitude ever since and are rarely seen in public 
as he awaits his one to three year sentence.

Initials: John Jacob Astor's watch helped identify his body after he drowned on the Titanic

Moment in time: Now Tony Marshall, whose mother Brooke Astor was Vincent Astor's third wife, claims that he has the original and is trying to sell it for $1million

However the couple ventured out for 
the event this week at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in 
Manhattan, thrown by Australian millionaire Clive Palmer who is behind 
the ambitious plans to build Titanic II.

Marshall wore the watch which he said had been given to him by his mother's third husband, Vincent Astor.

At the party, Marshall claimed that 
the gold piece had been found on the body of John Jacob Astor IV who was
wearing it when he died on the Titanic after it sank on April 15, 1912.

Values: The watch which Anthony Marshall is planning to sell to the highest bidder belonged to ancestor John Jacob Astor IV, a millionaire and decorated Spanish-American war hero who died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912

Sad news: The telegram which was sent to bear the news that JJ Astor's body had been recovered on April 22, 1912 and was identified by his personal effects including a gold watch

Part of the story is true- Astor's 
body was found with the gold watch after he drowned in the infamous 
shipwreck. The tycoon was the wealthiest person on board the luxury 
liner when it went down and the timepiece along with his gold watch, 
cuff links and a ring were later recovered with his body.

The part about Marshall owning it is believed to be made up.

Vincent Astor was the one to go claim 
his father's body in Nova Scotia after the wreck, and he wore the watch 
for years after that.

Vincent, who was reportedly sterile, had no children of his own and left the watch to his godson William Dobbyn V.

According to The Post, Dobbyn's wife 
Elizabeth put the watch up for auction in 1997 and that is when Mr 
Miottel bought the piece of history.

Treasured: JJ Astor's pocket watch from the Titanic was passed on to his son Vincent (pictured in 1920) who is believed to have worn it every day for the rest of his life. He passed it to his son Anthony Marshall who is now believed to want to sell it

Predictably, the Marshalls dispute 
this claim, with Charlene telling the paper: 'I’ve heard that story 
(that Mr Miottel owns the original) and it’s not true.'

John Jacob Astor has become one of the most fabled characters to emerge from the 1,517 passengers who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912.

The 47-year-old American tycoon, who built the Astoria Hotel in New York, was returning from his honeymoon on the doomed vessel with his 19-year-old pregnant wife Madeleine.

When the Titanic struck the iceberg, Astor helped his wife into a lifeboat but remained onboard. He was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck.

Half an hour later, the ship slipped beneath the ocean waves. His wife survived.

Astor's was one of the 333 bodies recovered on April 22 by a cable ship. He was identified by the initials sewn into his jacket along with his engraved gold watch.  

Astor's son Vincent inherited the piece and wore it for the rest of his life before passing it on to his son, Anthony.

J.J Astor is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. Madeleine gave birth to a son on August 14, 1912 who was named after his father.

Charlene, 67, was seen wearing Brooke 
Astor's diamond and ruby bracelet, one of the few things she inherited 
from her mother-in-law who referred to her as 'that b****'.  

The Marshalls were among 600 guests at the event to announce the ambitious project due for completion in 2016.

They enjoyed a dinner based on the final 11-course meal with wine pairings served aboard the Titanic.

The 88-year-old, who is in poor health following open heart surgery, is estranged from his twin sons.

They testified that their father and 
stepmother were abusing Astor, withholding medical treatment and leaving
her to lie drenched in her own urine.

Marshall was found guilty of 
defrauding his mother out of millions, money she had inherited from her 
third husband, hotelier and realtor Vincent Astor.

Brooke Astor, who died in 2007 aged 
105, had devoted her life to philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of 
money to the St. Regis Hotel, the New York Public Library and the 
Metropolitan Art Museum.

The multimillionaire, who had 
Alzheimer's, was left to spend her last days in heart-breaking 
conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue apartment while she 
napped in her own urine with no one to help, the Post previously 
reported.

The jury convicted Marshall of 14 counts, including first-degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud.

Vast wealth: Brooke Astor's Westchester home - most of the furniture was auctioned at Sotheby's last year and the proceeds went to philanthropic causes in New York City

Taken: While the furniture was initially given to Marshall from Brooke Astor's will, he will now not see any of the money after being found guilty of defrauding the elderly woman
