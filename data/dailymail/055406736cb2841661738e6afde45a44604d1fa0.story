Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio

A housemate of the victim testified on the sixth day of Drew Peterson's murder trial that former Illinois policeman once broke into their shared home in SWAT gear and threatened his ex-wife at knife point.

'I could kill you and make it look like an accident,' Kristen Anderson reportedly testified Wednesday of the words Peterson related to Kathleen Savio during that chilling episode in the long-running saga.

Only moments before rendering that crucial bit of testimony, Anderson broke down in sobs on the stand - and had to be ushered out of court.

Meanwhile, Judge Edward Burmila,handed the prosecution a key victory in allowing Anderson's account of that fateful night, since it is hearsay - which is typically not admitted during trial proceedings.

Anderson never actually heard Peterson articulate the knife-point threat to Savio, who was found dead in her bathtub in 2004, but said that the victim told her about the incident after it occurred.

Burmila initially appeared as if he would bar jurors from hearing Anderson's account, but then did an about-face, as the usually mild-mannered Will County State's Attorney prosecuting the case implored him to admit it.

'This evidence should have life!' shouted James Glasgow to the judge. The jury was not in the room at the time.

Another judge who had formerly heard portions of the case previously barred the same testimony from being admitted at trial.

The
ruling is especially important, as legal observers have long noted the 
dearth of actual physical evidence linking Peterson to Savio's death, 
despite the preponderance of hearsay suggesting he did, indeed, kill 
her.

Defense attorneys
tried gamely to rebound from the stunning ruling, which an 
obviously-thrilled Glasgow characterized to reporters after Wednesday's 
proceedings as, 'historical' and a crossroads in the case.

During
cross-examination, defense attorney Joe Lopez raised his voice, 
pressing Anderson repeatedly about why - if she now found aforementioned
threat so unsettling - she didn't move out of Savio's house.

You
didn't move out, did you? ... You did nothing ... because you didn't 
believe her, that's why,' The Associated Press reported Lopez shouting 
over the objection of angry prosecutors.

'Sir, no one listened to Kathy,' Anderson added later.

Meanwhile,
retired Illinois State Police sergeant Patrick Collins told jurors he 
permitted Peterson to sit in on his official interview of then-wife 
Stacy - who notably provided the former policeman with an alibi for the 
day of Savio's death. Peterson married Stacy, who has also disappeared, 
after divorcing Savio..

Collins said he made the unorthodox decision because Peterson asked that he be allowed to do so as, 'a professional courtesy.'

The
retired state policeman then regaled the jury with an account that 
overtly suggested the accused manipulated Stacy Peterson's answers to 
his questions regarding where he was on the day of Savio's death.'

'He sat very close to Stacy as we proceeded to ask questions,' Collins recalled. 'She was very distraught.'

'There was one particular question 
where he did have to refresh her memory,' Collins recalled, according to The Chicago Tribune. 'He leaned over to Stacy and said, 'You remember 
what you cooked for breakfast.' He said, 'bacon' or 'sausage' and that 
was it.'

Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right

'She became shaken
and started to cry,' Collins said. 'And (so) we shut the interview 
down.' He said he did not interview her again.

Stacy Peterson, who police presume 
dead, initially provided Peterson with an alibi, but later changed her 
tune to confide in friends that she believed her husband had, indeed, 
killed his third and former wife, Savio.
