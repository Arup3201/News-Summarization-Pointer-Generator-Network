Walmart has said it is re-editing a commercial featuring a black man mouthing 'I can't breathe', after viewers complained it reminded them of the Eric Garner case.

The advert, for the Walmart Family Mobile, shows a man handing a cellphone to his overjoyed daughter who squeals and wraps her arms around her father, hugging him tightly.

'I can't breathe,' the dad mouths jokingly as he struggles.

The commercial first aired over the summer, but it appears to have struck a nerve in the wake of the high-profile death of Eric Garner, who died after being held in a chokehold by NYPD officer Daniel Palenteo. 

In a video of the incident last July,  the 43-year-old father could be heard yelling, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe', as he was pushed to the ground. 

In the wake of the grand jury decision not to indict Palenteo, those three words have been used by demonstrators nationwide as a rallying cry to protest Garner's death.

'Albeit, it's his daughter and he's joking about choking', he said, before adding, 'the timing of the video is not good'.

Other viewers took to Twitter to suggest that Walmart might want to re-think  the commercial in the light of the past few days' events.

One commentator tweeted: '#walmart did you really just air a commercial in NY where a little black girl has her arm around her dads neck and he says #icantbreathe.'

Another wrote: 'Ad itself is fine, just timing of events no corp could predict. Happened to see it for first time this morning.'

Walmart was quick to respond and reassure viewers that the commercial would be tweaked.

'Consider it done,' the Walmart newsroom tweeted to viewers complaining about the ad. 'We can see how the ad could be viewed differently today than when it first aired. We're re-editing.'
