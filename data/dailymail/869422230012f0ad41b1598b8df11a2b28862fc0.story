Barring any last-minute hitches, the former Cardiff manager will be appointed the club's new boss in the next 24 hours on a three-year contract.

And the Scot will immediately look to bolster the Eagles's forward line by bringing Wilfried Zaha back to Selhurst Park.

Mackay first spoke with Palace chairman Steve Parish on Friday about the vacancy, less than 24 hours after Tony Pulis's departure.

By Saturday, Mackay had grown increasingly confident that he was in pole position to land the role.

Former Spurs manager Tim Sherwood interrupted a holiday in Spain to fly in for talks with Parish on Sunday morning.

But, as of Tuesday night, it is understood the 45-year-old is yet to hear back from Palace about the role.

And  Mackay, who held further talks with Palace on Sunday and Monday, was poised to be named the Selhurst Park club's next boss.

He will immediately launch bid to land Zaha, who has been told he can leave Old Trafford by manager Louis van Gaal.

Sunderland striker Connor Wickham and Watford forward Troy Denney are also potential signings for Mackay.
