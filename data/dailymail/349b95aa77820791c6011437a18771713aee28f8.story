When people imagine Hollywood, they envision streets filled with rich and famous people whose luxurious lifestyles are represented in movies.

But one photographer ventured just a few miles away from the multi-million dollar mansions and film studios to experience a different side of the city.

Visiting some of Los Angeles' most down-trodden parts, he witnessed the struggle of people living on the streets.

Rugged: Photographer Michael Pharaoh
took photos of homeless people during a visit to Hollywood

Project: The New Zealander spent two days walking the streets of the city's poorest areas and took pictures of as many of the homeless as he could, including this old man and a woman

Impoverished: This woman has a blackened face through living on the streets

Michael Pharoah, 22 from New Zealand was on holiday in the United States when he decided to take on the project.

He said he was humbled by individuals who told him stories about how they had ended up on the streets.

He said: 'I was recently on 
holiday in America and visited Hollywood, I thought this would be a good
opportunity to exercise my photography skills.

'I decided to walk around for a couple of days to how many photos I could take of all of the homeless people. It was fascinating to me because we don't have the same plethora of homeless people as L.A.

'It was interesting to hear all of their stories and how they came to live on the streets. This project was both a sad yet humbling one.'

Skin: The blue eyes of this old man are surrounded by a grey, wrinkled face

Pain: Michael Pharaoh tried to capture the expressions of the homeless whose living conditions are a stark contrast to the wealthy residents living nearby

Tired: The photographer said he was staggered by the 'plethora' of homeless people in LA

His website says he is a 22 year old graphic designer 
based out of Hamilton, New Zealand who has an 'undying passion for all 
forms of design since I can remember'.

Despite being filled with rich and famous citizens who dominate the showbiz industry, the city also has vast areas of povrty and squalor.

The group of photographs highlight the 
contrast which has been highlighted in the past by those who have 
referred to the place as 'bizarre'.

Many have blackened skin and clothes from where they have not been able to wash, while others have overgrown facial hair.

One also had a bandage wrapped around his head, showing that life on the streets had taken its toll.

The New Zealand photographer captured many close-ups of his subject's eyes, revealing wrinkled skin and scars on their faces.

The images also give an insight into the emotions some of those living on the street go through on a day-to-day basis.

Emotions: The photographer decided to focus on the downtrodden areas, and bumped into men like this one, who told him stories of how they ended up on the streets

Hurt: The bandages and facial injuries on the old man (left) show how living on the street has taken its toll while the other (right) stares into the camera and reflects on how he ended up becoming homeless

Unclean: The photographer beautifully captures the dirt around this man's eyes as a result of a life on the city streets

Hollywood: The city is known for wealthy residents, but nearby the homeless, including this man, live in squalor

Focus: Michael Pharaoh zooms in on this man's face, revealing a scar next to his right eye
