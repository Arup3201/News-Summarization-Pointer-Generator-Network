New York Times columnist David Carr died Thursday after collapsing in the newsroom. Just hours before, the 58-year-old had participated in a TimesTalk with speakers including Ed Snowden

And just hours before news of his death broke Thursday evening, Carr participated in a TimesTalk, featuring Ed Snowden, among others.

It's no surprise then that Carr's death came as a shock to so many.

Initial reports, the New York Times' included, said Carr died in the newsroom. The Times' website now says Carr collapsed in the newsroom and later died at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital. 

The cause of death was not immediately known.

Carr is survived by wife Jill Rooney Carr, an event planner with whom he lived in Montclair, New Jersey with their daughter Maddie. He also has twin daughters, Erin and Meagan.

He joined the Times in 2002 as a business reporter, covering magazine publishing. His Media Equation column appeared in the Monday business section. 

Before joining the Times, Carr was a contributing writer for The Atlantic Monthly and New York magazine. He also was a media writer for news website Inside.com.

Carr served as editor of the Washington City Paper, an alternative weekly in Washington, D.C. He also was editor of a Minneapolis-based alternative weekly called Twin Cities Reader.

Carr was well known for writing about his personal life and penned a memoir in 2008 The Night of the Gun in which he detailed his struggles with cocaine addiction.

The book, published by Simon and Schuster, traces Carr's rise from cocaine addict to single dad raising twin girls to sobered-up media columnist for the Times.

Carr said he wrote up a book proposal 'on a dare to myself' in two days. After an agent sold the idea, Carr ended up interviewing about 60 people and working on the book for three years. He took the transcribed interviews, numerous documents and pictures to his family's cabin in the Adirondacks, where he wrote the book.

Last year, Carr began teaching a Boston University class that explored the creative business models to support digital journalism. It was among the first professorships dedicated to evaluating how media organizations can sustain themselves financially as readers and advertisers migrate to digital platforms, a crisis that has doomed some news organizations and threatens the viability of others.

Carr had written about the issue extensively.

'I think a lot of journalism education that is going on is broadly not preparing kids for the world that they are stepping into,' Carr told The Boston Globe.
