The coffin of the 'tallest man in the world' was carried to the graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse.

Leonid Stadnyk, who died this week aged 44, is believed to have been 8ft 5in tall but he refused to be measured by Guinness World Records officials, regarding such a request as 'humiliating'.

The peasant farmer, who suddenly started growing at the age of 12 after a botched brain operation, saw his height as a 'curse', rather than good fortune.

Leonid Stadnyk, the unofficial tallest man in the world, was carried to his grave on the back of an open truck

A gentle giant: Mr Stadnyk, from Ukraine, had a huge growth spurt at the age of 12 after a bungled operation

Transport had always been an issue for the gentle giant, who said that 'being in a bus for me is like a normal person being driven in the boot of a car - torture'.

And the same problems followed him in death, as his coffin had to be driven to the cemetery on an open truck because it did not fit into the converted minibuses normally used as hearses in Ukraine.

At his funeral, conducted by an Orthodox priest in his native Zhitomyr region, he was called 'a giant in every sense'.

As mourners bade their final farewell, his head lay on a drape in the colours of Ukraine, yellow and blue, his hand clasping a candle.

A hero in his own war-ravaged country, once called the 'Pride of Ukraine', he was found dead on Sunday - Independence Day - from a cerebral haemorrhage following health problems.

Despite the fortune he could have made by taking advantage of his size, the gentle giant always refused to be measured for record books, not wishing to be seen as a performing Goliath.

Meanwhile his feet were a massive UK size 27, making them 18in in length. Mr Stadnyk had to give up his career as a vet as he could not find shoes in his size that could withstand freezing temperatures

Humble: The 8ft 5in man was bigger than other 'tallest men', but refused to be measured by records officials

Mr Stadnyk said he did not want to be seen as a circus freak and had no desire to be in 'this Guinness book'

'I have more important things to do getting through the survival course that is our life in Ukraine,' he once said.

A peasant farmer in the Ukrainian village of Podoliantsy, Mr Stadnyk was a modest man who admitted to problems in his love life caused by his colossal frame.

'I don't want or need the fame that this would bring so I have no desire to be in this Guinness book,' he said, shaking his large head in his home, where he had to constantly stoop to avoid bumping his head on the ceiling.

'To me, my height is a curse, a punishment from God, not something to celebrate.

'What sin I have committed, I do not know. All my life I have dreamed of being just like everyone else.'

Unable to independently verify his measurements, Guinness instead officially listed Bao Xishun as the world's tallest man despite being about inches shorter than the Ukrainian. 

A Guinness World Records spokeswoman once said: 'We have contacted Stadnyk, but he seems like a very shy guy.

'He doesn't want us around. So we have to stick to what we have.'

Watch your head: The modest farmer had to stoop in most parts of his humble home in the town of Podoliantsy

While Mr Stadnyk was popular and had many friends, he saw his height as a 'curse' and lived an unhappy life

He never married and did not commit to any women as he did not want to burden them with his health problems

Surgeons bungled an operation on a benign brain tumour when Mr Stadnyk was 12, cranking his pituitary gland, responsible for generating the hormones stimulating growth, into overdrive

'This life is for smaller people': The gentle giant, who was loved by neighbours, was never happy with his life

Mr Stadnyk said that while he was unofficially the tallest man, he still felt like 'one of the most helpless'

Ironically at school in the then USSR, the gentle giant was almost the smallest boy in his class, and was nicknamed 'Titch'.

Surgeons bungled an operation on a benign brain tumour when Mr Stadnyk was 12, cranking his pituitary gland, responsible for generating the hormones stimulating growth, into overdrive.

At one point his giganticism left him growing at the rate of roughly a foot every three years.

He wore size 27 shoes for feet that measured almost 18 inches in length. His gargantuan palms were more than a foot in diameter.

Talking about life, he explained how his height prevented him following his desired career.

'I was trained as a vet and loved my work,' he said.

'But gradually I found that I couldn't get the shoes I needed in winter to protect me from the frostbite. I just couldn't keep on with this work.

'I know I'm the tallest man but at the same time I often feel one of the most helpless. This life is for smaller people.'

'My helplessness makes me angry. I don't like to be mocked.' 

Ironically, Mr Stadnyk (centre left) was called 'Titch' at school because he was one of the shortest in his class

As a youngster, Mr Stadnyk aspired to be a vet but had to quit because of issues related to his sheer size

Leonid Stadnyk, the 'tallest man in the world', died this week aged 44 from a cerebral haemorrhage

At home he slept on two double beds, pushed together, but had no woman to join him because he was scared to make his problems someone else's burden.

He said: 'I don't want to inflict my problems on a wife. I think it would not be fair on her.'

Mr Stadnyk died a bachelor.

He said his dearest wish was to climb down from the tower that imprisoned him, adding: 'I know it can never happen.'

His neighbours knew him as a kind a generous man, always ready to help.

One, Bronyslave, said he was 'the most unselfish, diligent man, of a pure soul.'

Though not in the Guinness World Records for his height, he was perhaps bigger in other ways than many whose names are included there.
