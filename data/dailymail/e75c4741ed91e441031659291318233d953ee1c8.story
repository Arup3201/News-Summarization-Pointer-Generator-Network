This is the alleged arsonist who has been charged with causing £815,000 worth of damage on a ferry bound for Amsterdam.

Boden George Hughes, 26, is accused of setting fire to a cabin on board the DFDS boat King Seaways on Saturday night.

The ferry, travelling from Newcastle to Holland, never reached its destination and was forced to turn back.

At North Tyneside Magistrates Court today Hughes, of Sunderland, stood in the dock charged with committing arson with intent in that he 'damaged by fire cabin 568 of the King Seaways DFDS ferry to the value of approximately £815,000'.

The charge also stated that Hughes allegedly intended 'to destroy property or damage by recklessness as to whether such property would be destroyed or damaged and intending by the damage to endanger the life of another'.

Hughes, who wore a grey Adidas sweatshirt, spoke only to confirm his age, date of birth and address.

He is also charged with affray in that he threatened 'unlawful violence towards another'.

Defence barrister Tony Southwick put in no application for bail and Hughes was remanded in custody.

Tracy Plant, prosecuting, told Chair of the Bench Mavin Johnson: 'I invite you to commit this case to Crown Court.'

Hughes will next appear at North Tyneside Magistrates Court on January 14 at 10am.

He was arrested along with a 28-year-old man who was detained on suspicion of affray and later bailed pending further inquiries.

Passengers on a crossing from Newcastle to Amsterdam complained of being 'treated like animals' as the DFDS vessel King Seaways returned to port

Fights reportedly broke out as passengers were forced to cram on to outer decks for safety

Six people including a pregnant woman were airlifted to hospital after the fire.

When
 passengers were eventually allowed off the King Seaways cruise ferry after it returned to North Shields, North Tyneside, some vowed
 never to sail again after their frightening experience.

They complained of being 'treated like animals' as the vessel returned to port and fights broke out as passengers were forced to cram on to outer decks for safety.

The
 ship was heading for Amsterdam and a blaze started in a cabin when the 
vessel was around 30 miles off the North Yorkshire coast at around 
10.45pm on Saturday night.

RAF rescue helicopters were scrambled as crew members tackled the blaze and passengers were forced to evacuate their cabins.

Some children were left shivering outside without their shoes and socks as they had been sleeping when the alarm was raised and passengers complained of their treatment.

'We were treated like animals on 
that boat,’ said Joe Hilton, 22, a sports student from Billingham, Co 
Durham. 'I was traumatised, I haven't slept all night. We didn’t get any
 food until about seven this morning.'

Chris
 Johnson, 27, an engineer from Rochdale, Lancashire, accused the crew of
 failing to keep passengers informed. 'The staff wouldn't tell us 
anything,' he said. 'I was panicking and so was my girlfriend.

'It was quite scary, especially for the kids on board. It was really cold and everyone was crammed outside and they wouldn’t let us know what was going on.'

Julie Bell, of Washington, Tyne and 
Wear, said: 'It was like a scene from a movie – a chaotic mess, 
horrible. It was terrifying and I won’t be travelling by boat again.'

The
 six people who were airlifted – the pregnant woman, a man and four crew
 – were taken to Scarborough Hospital suffering what was believed to 
have been the effects of smoke inhalation and have since been 
discharged.

A further 17 people were treated by the ferry doctor.

Many
 of the 946 passengers had been planning to spend New Year in Amsterdam 
but have been forced to abandon their holidays after being taken back to
 Newcastle’s ferry port at North Shields.

They
 have been offered refunds for their ferry tickets, but it is unclear 
whether they will be entitled to further compensation for their ruined 
trips.

The fire broke out 
at 10.45pm on deck 5 while the ferry was about 30 miles off Flamborough 
Head in Yorkshire. Crew members extinguished it quickly but the captain 
decided to turn back as a precaution.

Witnesses
 said that when they first heard the emergency alarms, they thought it 
was a joke – with some even singing the theme tune to the Titanic.

But then staff began to tell people to get outside and congregate next to the lifeboats.

Karl
 McMurrough, 18, from  Sunderland, said: 'We all got rushed on to the 
deck. There were helicopters, kids squealing, life jackets. They were 
telling us to keep calm but they weren’t giving us any information.'

Steven
 Basford, 28, from Northumberland, added: 'The fire was on our floor but
 on the other side of the ship. When we climbed up to the communal area 
we could see the smoke. It wasn’t thick but it was definitely 
noticeable.

'Obviously people had had a lot to drink. It's a bit of a party boat.’
