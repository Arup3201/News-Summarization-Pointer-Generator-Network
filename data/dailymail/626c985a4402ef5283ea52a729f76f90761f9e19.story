A landlord claims more than $12,000 of damage has been caused to his California mountain cabin after two separate sets of Airbnb guests went on alcohol and drug-fueled rampages over the holidays last month.

David Cook has since posted photographs of the destruction on Facebook.

He said he hopes his story will serve as a cautionary tale to other would-be Airbnb renters.

The damage caused to Cook's property near Lake Arrowhead in southern California included doors being taken off their hinges

Both times, Cook told Business Insider that the couples stayed for two nights and allegedly trashed his property near Lake Arrowhead in southern California.

Cook said the first couple got ‘liquored and drugged up’ so bad that they begin fighting and then trashed the cabin.

He estimates that they caused $2,000 of damage after ripping a ceramic soap dish out of the shower, snapping the bedpost off of a solid mahogany bed - a 100-year-old family heirloom - and braking a banister.

The second group stayed over New Year’s Eve and Cook has accused them of causing even more damage. 

Once again Cook says the couple - a boyfriend and his fiancé - had a fight. ‘We think this guy was on meth or something,’ he told Business Insider.

Cook has accused the man of destroying two nightstands - described as antique family heirlooms. The man then took a leg from one of the nightstands and proceeded to bash holes in walls and windows.

A closet door was ripped off its hinges, curtains were destroyed and smashed bottles of alcohol were left over the floor and patio.

Cook estimates the damage caused by the second couple at over $10,000.

Fortunately for Cook, Airbnb has agreed to cover the costs of the damage incurred.

The company operates an insurance scheme for its users called Host Guarantee, which states that it covers hosts for property damage up to a $1 million.

'Over 26 million guests have stayed on Airbnb and problems for hosts and guests are extremely rare. Our Trust and Safety team is investigating this matter and is in contact with this host to help reimburse him under our Host Guarantee program,' said the organization. 

Cook believes that his bad experience should act as a warning for other Airbnb hosts.

'The story is for hosts like us to make sure they raise the security deposit and reword their postings to let guests know that this will not be tolerated and for hosts to know that this stuff happens more often than Airbnb wants the public to know. 

'They don't want the public to know that hosts' properties are being trashed.'
