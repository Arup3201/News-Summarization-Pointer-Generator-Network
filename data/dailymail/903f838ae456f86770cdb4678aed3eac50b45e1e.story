A Texas real-estate developer is in possession of footage of John F. Kennedy's motorcade from that fateful day in Dallas that he believes supports the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone.

Whether or not the footage is genuine isn't yet known, but if it is, it would represent a dramatic development in a story 50 years in the making.

Following the 50th anniversary of the death of JFK, Stephen Bowen, who is also a principal in small film production company, decided the time was right to sell the footage, which reportedly depicts a second shooter, to the highest bidder.

That fateful day: John F and Jackie Kennedy in the car in which he would be assassinated

According to The Wrap, Bowen acquired the film from a Houston television news producer, who had held onto it secretly for more than 40 years.

While no one has yet viewed the footage, it's said to show a second shooter hiding in the bushes along the route the presidential motorcade took on 22 November, 1963.

'You can see a guy in the bushes with a gun,' the source told The Wrap.

It also reportedly contains lost and damaged frames from the famous footage made by Abraham Zapruder and sold to Time in 1963.

The 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy's death has reignited the debate about the assassination, with many speculating recently that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone, including Oswald's wife Marina Oswald, and John F Kennedy's nephew, Robert F Kennedy Jr.

Not alone: Many, including John Kerry and Robert F Kennedy Jr, have expressed doubt at the Warren Commission's finding that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone

Kennedy Jr recently said that his father, Robert Kennedy thought the Warren commission that found Oswald acted alone was a 'shoddy piece of craftsmanship.'

'The evidence at this point I think is very, very convincing that it was not a lone gunman,' said Kennedy Jr.Â 

John Kerry has also spoken about his misgivings on the findings of the Warren commission.

'Regarding possible conspiracies, to this day I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,' he said in Parade magazine.

Conspiracy: New footage purports to show a second shooter hiding in bushes along the presidential motorcade's route

Bowen is represented by The Gersh Agency, which intends to hold private screenings of the footage for interested parties next week in Los Angeles.

If the footage was owned by the Houston producer for more than 40 years, then Bowen must have owned it for a significant portion of the past 10 years.

He has decided now is the time to 'bring it to market.'
