This is the moment Republican senator Ted Cruz told a campaign rally 'Your world is on fire' - to the horror of a three-year-old girl sitting in the front row.

The 44-year-old, from Texas, was speaking  in Barrington, New Hampshire and made the remark while attacking the Obama administration's foreign policy.

But he was forced to stop his speech momentarily after a little girl sitting on her mom's lap said in apparent confusion: 'The world is on fire?'. As the audience chuckled, Cruz turned to the scared youngster and repeated the line twice.

The audience chuckled after a confused three-year-old girl sitting in the front row repeated the line, asking: 'The world's on fire?'

The incident was captured on camera on Sunday as Cruz was attempting to drum up conservative support in New Hampshire.

After accusing the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of 'leading from behind', Cruz suggests that the 'whole world is on fire', Raw Story reports.

Seconds later - although it cannot be heard clearly on the video - three-year-old Julie Trant replies in shock: 'The world is on fire?'

The audience can be heard chuckling before Cruz turns and smiles as he tells the youngster: 'The world is on fire, yes. Your world is on fire.'

After repeating his line twice, Cruz, pictured, tried to reassure the child by saying: 'Your mommy’s here and everyone’s here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better'

But in a bid to reassure the child, he added: 'But you know what, your mommy’s here and everyone’s here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better.'

Cruz, speaking to the Strafford County Republicans, eventually got back on track as he called for a flat tax and a repeal of ObamaCare, New York Daily News reported.  

During the speech he lashed out at President Barack Obama claiming his administration had repeatedly trampled on the Constitution, Reuters said. 

Cruz, who is exploring a run for the White House in 2016, slammed Obama on his handling of immigration, negotiations with Iran and his signature health care reforms.

The freshman senator from Texas was one of four Republican presidential hopefuls who paid weekend visits to New Hampshire.
