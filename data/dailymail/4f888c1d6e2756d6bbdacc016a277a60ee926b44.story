West Brom have announced the signing of Argentina wide midfielder Sebastian Blanco on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee from Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkiv.

The 26-year-old, capped twice by his country, can play on either flank and has become the Baggies' 11th summer acquisition.

'I'm really pleased that we've managed to add Sebastian to the squad,' head coach Alan Irvine said on www.wba.co.uk.

Versatile: West Brom's latest recruit Blanco is capable of playing on either flank

'He's an Argentina international who joined Metalist for a lot of money. Unfortunately, he suffered an injury not long after the move, which held up his progress.

'Since then, he's shown his quality. He's adept with both feet, is a nice crosser of the ball, creates chances and also scores goals.

'With the players we've brought in this summer, the squad has a much better balance thanks to the hard work of the chairman (Jeremy Peace), Richard Garlick, (technical director) Terry Burton and the recruitment staff.'

Blanco helped Metalist finish as runners-up in the Ukrainian top flight in 2012/13, netting 10 goals in 68 league appearances during his three and a half years in Kharkiv.

He follows Craig Gardner, Joleon Lescott, Chris Baird, Sebastien Pocognoli, Brown Ideye, Andre Wisdom, Jason Davidson, Cristian Gamboa, Georgios Samaras and Silvestre Varela in joining West Brom during this transfer window.
