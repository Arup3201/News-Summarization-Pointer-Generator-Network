Australians have one of the best vantage points in the world to watch the stunning ‘blood moon’ lunar eclipse on Wednesday, with astrophysicists promising it will be even more spectacular than last time.

On April 15, armchair astronomers watched the first of four total lunar eclipses, part of a four-stage event, known as a 'Tetrad', that is also believed to mark the beginning of significant events – even the end of the world - in some religions.

The awe-inspiring spectacle occurs when the Earth's shadow passes over the moon - and on Wednesday the second eclipse will happen higher up in the sky promising a more dazzling sight.

‘This time it’s going to start higher in the sky, on April 15 the moon was low down close to the horizon but this time it will start about a third of the way up from the horizon so when it‘s red we will see it much higher and brighter in the sky,’ astrophysicist Dr Stephen Hughes told Daily Mail Australia.

A red moon will be visible in Australia and other parts of the world on Wednesday

The senior lecturer at Queensland University of Technology explained: ‘A blood Moon occurs when the orbit of the Moon is nearly perfectly aligned with the orbit of the Earth around the Sun.

‘The simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises on the rim of the Earth, make the Moon red.’

With a small pair of binoculars people will also be able to spot Uranus about ‘two moon widths away’ from the the blood moon.

Dr Hughes advised to look out for a ‘bluey green dot’.

Weather permitting, Australia, New Zealand, North America and South America will all have great views of the blood moon, while Europe, Africa and the Middle East will miss out.

It is described as the 'simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises'

In Australia, Dr Hughes said that ‘anywhere down the East Coast’ is the best place to view it, while people probably won’t be able to see the whole of it in Western Australia. ‘They might just see the end of it,’ he said.

In Australia the lunar eclipse will occur on Wednesday night at the following times:

NSW, ACT, Victoria, Tasmania: Eclipse begins 8:15PM. Totality begins 9:25PM. Totality ends 10:25PM. Eclipse ends 11:35PM.

Queensland: Eclipse begins 7:15PM. Totality begins 8:25PM. Totality ends 9:25PM. Eclipse ends 10:35PM.

South Australia: Eclipse begins 7:45PM. Totality begins 8:55PM. Totality ends 9:55PM. Eclipse ends 11:05PM.

Northern Territory: Eclipse begins 6:45PM. Totality begins 7:55PM. Totality ends 8:55PM. Eclipse ends 10:05PM.

Western Australia: Eclipse begins 6:19PM (moonrise). Totality begins 6:25PM. Totality ends 7:25PM. Eclipse ends 8:35PM.

The eclipse will happen two more times over the next two years as part of this cycle, on April 4 and September 28, 2015. The next Tetrad cycle won't occur until 2032.

‘If we were on the moon during this eclipse, we would see a bright orange-red ring in the sky where the Earth should be. The light from that bright ring bathes the moon in a reddish glow, which we can see from Earth.’ Dr Hughes explained.

Some Christians are concerned that the celestial event could mark the start of terrible events, based on a passage from the Bible that says: 'The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes.'

In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition.

The second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded and the most recent one - in 1967 - happened during the Six-Day War between Arabs and Israelis.

John Hagee, a Christian pastor who has written a book on the Tetrad called 'Four Blood Moons: Something is About to Change' told the Daily Express that the first of the blood moons in 2014 took place right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover.

The second, on October 8, occurs during the Feast of the Tabernacle and the third will be on April 4, 2015, also during Passover.

The final one happens on September 28, 2015, which is also during the Feast of the Tabernacles. 

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet.

The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red.

This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic.

When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon.

This gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks.

At the eclipse's peak, the moon enters the Earth's full shadow; the umbra.

At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red visible light; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset.

As a result, the red light reflects off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it.
