Today's Mulberry show, held at noon in Claridge's, begun, as has become tradition, with a Bloody Mary-fuelled drinks reception where air kissing and catwalk catch-ups create a hubbub that whips up pre-show excitement to fever pitch.

One of the buzzier events on the LFW calendar, it's quite an occasion even before the clothes reach the catwalk.

Today though, the anticipation was perhaps even more tangible, given that this was to be Creative Director Emma Hill's last for the British design house.

She's back! Cara Delevingne leads out the models at Mulberry creative director Emma Hill's last show

Elegant: Cara Delevingne sported a beautifully tailored short suit and a pailette-embellished white dress

Floral: Hill's graphic blooms were used liberally on dresses

Cool crimson: Patriotic scarlet and white dominated the palette

Retro: Hill's old fashioned Marimekko style prints were a hit

Cool canines: In true Mulberry style, designer-clad dogs accompanied the models onto the catwalk

Best accessory: Turbo the Mulberry bulldog was one of the stars of the show

Contrast: Nubuck and suede introduced gentle structure while bold blooms on silk brought a country garden feel. I loved the bold orange platforms, which picked out orange splashes throughout the collection

New favourite: The Willow given an update for SS14 with embroidery

Want...it...now: Clutch in fiery orange

Hill announced her departure from the
 company in June, making this her swansong collection. The moodboard, 
which in these plugged-in times was shared by Mulberry via email and 
social networking before the show, spoke of quintessentially English tea
 time, ditzy florals in china print tempered by soft pinks, blues and 
greys.

And that was 
indeed what was delivered: Clean-lined coats in floral jacquard, fluid 
long-legged trousers in feather-light pavement grey silk, light summer 
blues, ballet pink silk and bright textured whites.

Then
 came bolder florals - big blooms on silk tees and dresses, smaller 
prints on a clutch. The colour palette was bold but streamlined - blue, 
orange, cream, white, grey - with those same hues running through print 
and trim.

Nappa leather
 shirts, trousers, skirts and jackets provided gentle structure with a 
hint of edge. I loved a striped tee in midnight blue Nappa suede and its
 matching skirt, also the elegant cream embroidered coats and pyjama silk 
trousers and floaty blouses.

This
 being Mulberry, bags were standout too. The popular Willow was 
reincarnated in silky midnight blue calf, embroidered with white raffia 
flowers or in Nubuck stripes. 

The classic Bayswater was rendered in fiery orange or inky blue Nubuck stripes making it a must-have... again.

And the large Kensal made an appearance in cream or summer blue velvet calf.

Cara Delevingne opened the show, and was only slightly overshadowed by the two canine catwalk stars who walked in Mulberry coats.

Last year's doggy star, a standard poodle called Max, came to watch, dressed in a plaid Mulberry cost and sporting a flawless new hairstyle - the best dressed on the front row perhaps?

Anna Wintour seemed to think so - she was cooing over the dog as he tried to creep up on the catwalk. Proof that Ms Wintour is maybe not as icy as her reputation would suggest.

With Wintour and her UK Vogue counterpart Alexandra Shulman in the front row, fashion's foremost editorial figures were represented.

So too was the celebrity element, with Alexa Chung, she of Mulberry's Alexa satchel fame, taking her place alongside actor Douglas Booth and actresses Juno Temple and Rebecca Hall.

The show, which played out to a 
soundtrack including Madness's Our House, a bit of Queen and the 
children's party song, If You're Happy And You Know It, saw models step 
through elegant doorways covered with ivy and climbing white roses, 
bringing a stately home country garden feel to the hotel's interior.

The
 show notes said Mulberry 'revisited the style attitude 'Le Style 
Anglais' with its laid back interpretation of heritage luxury'.

'The
 new season is both town and country: the collection was influenced by 
modernist overtones from Sixties London juxtaposed with the opulence of a
 quintessential English country house and gardens,' they said.

'In
 its style and attitude the collection embraced both familiarity and 
modernity, working with classic prints and textures reinterpreted to 
create new season signatures imbued with Mulberry's inherent British 
wit.'

Swansong: Creative Director Emma Hill walks out onto the catwalk to take a bow for the last time at Mulberry

It came to a 
close to a rousing rendition of Land Of Hope And Glory, which saw fashion commentator Hilary
 Alexander jigging along in time to the music.

But Liz Jones, who was still 
reeling after being accosted for a photo by a fan after the show ('I 
don't usually get people telling me they like me!') said she would have 
hoped for Hill to go out on more of a high.

'I didn't think it was her best, to be honest,' said the Daily Mail fashion columnist. 'There was a lot of very sticky out fabric.

'Some of the coats were nice, but there was some very thick fabric that is not easy to wear. The shoes were quite clumpy too.'

But the celebrities, who are, after all the ones with the money to buy it, were more enamoured with the designs, with Alexa Chung declaring that she loved it all.

For her part, Hill proved just how those 'tricky' fabrics and pieces should be worn when she stepped out to take her final bow.

She wore a midnight blue Nappa leather jacket, cropped, short fur sleeves, with her jeans.

Bowing out in style.
