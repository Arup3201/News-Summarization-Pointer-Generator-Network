A manhunt for a Georgia father suspected of abducting his four-year-old son has ended after police found two bodies on Friday.

The bodies of a male child and man were found in woodland close to the Atlanta apartment where Sandra Rivera Ruiz was found seriously injured on Thursday.

The cause of death was not immediately available but police believe the deaths are a murder-suicide.

Victim: Jesus Dominguez, 4, is believed to have been killed by his father

Police had issued an Amber Alert to 
try to find Jesus Dominguez, after they found his mother severely beaten
 and unresponsive in the family's apartment.

They believed his life was in danger and that he had been taken by his father, Carlos Alberto Dominguez, according to Roswell police officer Lisa Holland.

Ms
 Ruiz is still in hospital and has not yet regained consciousness. 
Police believe she was attacked several hours before she was found on 
Thursday evening.

Her 
two older children, a five-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy, were at 
school at the time of the attack. They are being cared for by relatives.

Details of how the man and child died 
have not been released, but Fox 5 reported that they were found close 
together and near what appeared to a shallow grave.

Crime scene: A white forensic tent has been set up in woodland behind the apartment where Jesus lived

Investigation: Police collect evidence at the apartment where Jesus's mother was found dead

The bodies were found by police at about 10.15am on Friday morning, close to a path at the apartment complex.

'Thereâ€™s pathways that connect all these complexes together and so [Dominguez] probably is familiar with the area, being that he lived so close, Officer Holland told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.

Police had been called to the family's apartment by the victim's sister at 4.40pm. When they arrived they found the woman in a serious condition.

'Indications show that she has been there for quite a while, like many hours, in that state,' Officer Lisa Holland told Fox 5.

Manhunt: Police had been looking for the father and son since Thursday night

Ms Ruiz was unconscious when police found her, and is still in critical condition in hospital. She still does not know that her son has been killed.

Relatives of the victim claimed Dominguez had a violent temper and history of domestic abuse, according to WSB Radio.
