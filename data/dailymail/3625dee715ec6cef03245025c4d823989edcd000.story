Pope Francis and his predecessor Benedict embraced today in a historic meeting of two popes at Castel Gandolfo.

The men met on the helipad at the papal summer retreat, before praying together in the chapel.

Benedict offered Francis the kneeler traditionally used by the pope when he prays.

But Francis refused to take it alone, saying 'We're brothers', and the two used a different kneeler in the pews and prayed together, side-by-side.

Benedict made clear that he deferred to Francis as pope while Francis made clear he considered his predecessor to be a revered brother and equal.

Today's meeting is the first between two popes in more than 600 years as the Catholic Church finds itself in the unusual position of having two alive at the same time.

Traveling from the helipad to the palazzo, Francis sat on the right-hand side of the car, the traditional place of the pope, while Benedict sat on the left.

Francis brought a gift to Benedict, an icon of the Madonna, and told him that it is known as the 'Madonna of Humility.'

'I thought of you,' Francis told him as he presented the gift.

'You gave us so many signs of humility and gentleness in your pontificate.'

Benedict replied: 'Grazie, grazie.'Â 

Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi said he understands Benedict reiterated his pledge of obedience to the new pope, while Francis thanked Benedict for his ministry.

He said they both wore white, though Benedict was in a simple cassock and a quilted white jacket without the traditional sash and cape worn by Francis.

Walking with a cane, he looked frail compared to the robust 76-year-old Argentine.

Outside the villa, the main piazza of 
Castel Gandolfo was packed with well-wishers hoping to catch a 
glimpse of history as the two popes broke bread together and presumably 
discussed the future of the Catholic Church.

They chanted 'Francesco! 
Francesco.'

Benedict has been living at the papal summer villa since he officially retired on February 28, the first pope to step down in 600 years.

He has said he plans to live out his final years in prayer and remain 'hidden from the world.'

The Vatican is downplaying the lunch in keeping with Benedict's desire to remain in private and not interfere with his successor's papacy.

The men spoke privately for 45 minutes before sharing a meal with the two papal secretaries.

The Vatican press office issued photographs of the pair praying together and exchanging gifts before they were left to speak privately

There was to be no live coverage of the private meeting, only a few still photos from the official Vatican photographer.

The
 Vatican said Benedict was at the helipad in the villa gardens to 
welcome Francis, and that the two were meeting in Benedict's library and
 having lunch together.

Francis will then return to the Vatican later today, where crowds were gathering in St Peter's Square ahead of the Palm Sunday mass tomorrow and Holy Week leading up to Easter Sunday.

Earlier,
 he flew to the town on an Italian Air Force helicopter in scenes 
reminiscent of the night Benedict officially retired from the Church.

The Vatican spokesman said they would issue a general comment about the meeting but will not be giving a detailed account.

Benedict's resignation paved the way for the first pope from Latin America, the first Jesuit, and the first to call himself Francis after the 13th century friar who devoted himself to the poor, nature and working for peace.

There was speculation that the two popes may discuss the big issues facing the church: the rise of secularism in the world, the drop in priestly vocations in Europe, the competition that the Catholic Church faces in Latin America and Africa from evangelical Pentecostal movements.

Benedict left a host of unfinished business on Francis' plate, including the outcome of a top-secret investigation into the leaks of papal documents last year.

Francis may want to sound Benedict out on his ideas for management changes in the Holy See administration, a priority given the dysfunctional government he has inherited.

Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi spoke to the media in the piazza to report on the Popes' meeting

Then over coffee, they may discuss 
the future of Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, Benedict's trusted aide who has
 had the task of escorting his old pope into retirement and then 
returning to the Vatican to serve his successor in the initial rites of 
the office.

Gaenswein, who
 wept as he and Benedict made their goodbyes to staff in the papal 
apartment on February 28, has appeared visibly upset and withdrawn at 
times as he has been by Francis' side.

The
 Vatican has said Francis's primary secretary will be Monsignor Alfred 
Xuereb, who had been the No. 2 secretary under Benedict.

Francis visited Benedict at Castel Gandolfo today, where the former pope blessed crowds from the balcony as he appeared in public view for the last time on the evening of February 28

Pope Francis was inaugurated on Tuesday and led his first mass as pontiff in St Peter's Square in the Vatican

A week before the inauguration, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio appeared on the balcony of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace after his election was announced

Benedict's resignation and the emeritus pope's personal choices about his future have raised the question of how the Catholic Church will deal with the unusual situation of having one reigning and one retired pope living side-by-side, each of them called 'pope', each of them wearing papal white and even sharing the same aide in Gaenswein.

After a few months in Castel Gandolfo, Benedict is to return to the Vatican to live in a converted monastery in the Vatican gardens, just a short walk from St. Peter's Basilica and the shrine devoted to the Madonna where Francis went to pray on one of his first walks as pope.
