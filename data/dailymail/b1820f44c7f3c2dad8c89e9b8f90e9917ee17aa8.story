A fresh wave of storms drenched Britain yesterday with half a month of rain falling in just 24 hours capping a miserable start to October.

Commuters woke up to dismal conditions as gusts of up to 55mph battered parts of the country.

But despite the soaking start to the week there was brighter news on the horizon with a mini-heatwave settling in for the weekend which is predicted to make parts of Britain hotter than Madrid in Spain.
