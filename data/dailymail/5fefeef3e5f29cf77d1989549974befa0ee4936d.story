It's the cruise vessel that was branded the 'Pandemic Princess' after hundreds of passengers were struck down with the norovirus last week.

Now the owners of the troubled Sea Princess cruise ship have been forced to apologise after around 2000 passengers were left stranded in Fremantle, WA, because of engine problems.

Disgruntled holidaygoers took to the vessel's Facebook page to express their anger. 

'Virus vessel': The Sea Princess' was dubbed the 'Pandemic Princess' by some disgruntled customers after a 'small percentage' of passengers came down with the norovirus, a gastrointestinal virus which causes stomach cramping, vomiting and diarrhoea. 

'She is ONE SICK SHIP': One customer expressed her anger over her Sea Princess experience. 

'Cruise from hell': Another customer was displeased with some aspects of the cruise. 

Outrage: One of several posts written by a disgruntled customer. 

The Sea Princess, dubbed the 'Pandemic Princess' and the 'virus vessel' after passengers came down with the norovirus last week, has been plagued with problems in recent weeks. 

 

'They should have sorted out the engines ages ago,' one customer fumed. 'Feeling very upset like many other people, including the ones who (are) on board now.' 

On Sunday the Sea Princess was meant to embark on a 14 day cruise to Brisbane, via the Kimberley, Darwin and Papua New Guinea.

The troubled cruise liner arrived in Fremantle via Singapore on Saturday, in a voyage that was marred by the outbreak of the norovirus, a gastrointestinal illness which causes diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach cramping. 

The ship had been travelling at reduced speeds for a number of weeks due to a mechanical issue. Engineers in Fremantle discovered an 'additional technical issue' while conducting repairs.

Carnival Cruises spokesman David Jones said: 'On this basis, and with the deepest of regret, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Sea Princess' current cruise and proceed to dry dock where all the repairs can take place.' 

He said the company was 'profoundly sorry' to guests left stranded in Fremantle.  

Carnival Cruises has sent a team to Fremantle to help its stranded guests make alternative holiday arrangements, including arranging flights. Customers will also receive a full refund as well as 'cruise credit'.

One angry passenger, who said she had been on board the vessel's previous trip, wrote on the company's Facebook page: 'Better off that the cruise has been cancelled. Disembarked yesterday... she is ONE SICK SHIP.'

'(We) missed 3 ports that were on the itinerary, as well as many ill passengers as well as crew'. A trip to Bali was cancelled because the ship could not travel quickly enough. 

Voyager: The Sea Princess was scheduled to take around 2000 passengers on a trip around Australia's north coast to Brisbane. 

'Knew they should have sorted out the engines ages ago': The vessel has been beset with engine difficulties in recent weeks.

One traveller described their trip on the Sea Princess as the 'cruise from hell'. 

'We didn't get sick thank god the ship is falling apart  lots blocked toilets,rooms getting flooded, dirty water from room tap wont say what it was, people and staff getting sick and the list goes on (sic).'

Another tourist said her husband was bedridden for days with the illness. 'We are just off the 26 night cruise, sickness (was) horrible, my husband in cabin for 4 days,' she said.

There were conflicting reports about the number of passengers who fell ill. 

One passenger told The West Australian newspaper as many as 200 guests came down with the virus. 

Mr Jones would only tell Daily Mail Australia 'a small percentage of guests' were affected by the 'stomach bug'. 

The ship remains docked in Fremantle and passengers have been allowed to stay on board.
