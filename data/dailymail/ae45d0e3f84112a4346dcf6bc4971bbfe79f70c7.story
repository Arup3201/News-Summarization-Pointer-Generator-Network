Emma Watson has tweeted a picture of herself laughing in public in protest over comments made by the Turkish deputy prime minister.

The Harry Potter actress, 24, uploaded the picture today along with the message 'direnkahkaha' - which translated from Turkish means 'resist laughter'.

On Monday, at an Eid el-Fitr celebration, Turkey's deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc gave a speech in which he urged women to abide by a strict moral code, including not laughing in public.

Emma Watson has joined Twitter protests over comments by the Turkish deputy prime minister saying women shouldn't laugh in public by posting this picture on her Twitter account

The comment provoked outrage online, with women from the country and abroad flooding social media sites with images of themselves sharing a giggle. 

 Hundreds of women then posted pictures of themselves laughing out loud, and the hashtags #direnkahkaha - resist laughter - and #direnkadin - resist woman - trended on Twitter. Pictures were also posted on photo sharing site Instagram.

Mehtap Dogan of the Socialist Feminist Collective, who was among the women to post pictures of themselves, said Arınç comments were not an isolated incident of misogyny.

'His words perfectly illustrate his and the (ruling) AK party's attitude towards women,' she told The Guardian.

'In their eyes, women should not have any rights, they treat us like a separate species.'

Turkish men also showed their support. One user wrote that the men of a country 'where women are not allowed to laugh are cowards'.

As did Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, who is running against current prime minister Recap Tayyip Erdogan in next week's elections.

He said Turkey needed women to smile and to hear people laugh.

In his speech Arınç went on to complain about 'moral corruption' by television programmes which he said are transforming teenagers from 'symbols of chastity' into 'sex addicts'.

Describing his ideal chaste man or woman, Arnic said they should both have a sense of shame and honour.

He said: 'Chastity is so important,' he said. 'It is not only a name. It is an ornament for both women and men. [She] will have chasteness. Man will have it, too. He will not be a womaniser.

'He will be bound to his wife. He will love his children. She will not laugh in public. She will not be inviting in her attitudes and will protect her chasteness.'

According to the Hurriyet Daily News, he also condemned the transformation of young females in society.

He said: 'Where are our girls, who slightly blush, lower their heads and turn their eyes away when we look at their face, becoming the symbol of chastity?' 

Arınç also said he was frustrated by high consumption, referring to the number of cars and mobile phones that individuals now own.

Targeting women once more, Arınç said women discuss unnecessary things such as 'recipes' on the phone and should, in future, reserve these conversations for when they meet face-to-face. 

Mr Arınç is a member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) which conservative values leading to it being described as Islamist.

Turkey has historically been more progressive with women’s rights than neighbouring countries but problems concerning honour killings and domestic violence have prompted concern.
