Tina, 32, who works as a welder, tells viewers: 'We have a saying here in Alaska about our men; The odds are good, but the goods can be kind of odd.

'For a single girl looking for a guy, it can be downright scary.'

Jenny, 34, a divorcee who fell pregnant when she was just 13 years old, also agrees that dating in Kodiak 'is not like the rest of the world.'

Along with a low population, the weather is 'cold', 'wet' and 'rainy' and it stays dark for up to six months of the year.

Usual situation: Hayley seen on a date with one of the local men - like her girlfriends she said she wanted to go to Miami because she was tired of dating fishermen and bear hunters

Not much around: All of the women come from the remote wilds of Kodiak Island, where it stays dark for up to six months of the year and is usually wet and windy

Frustrated: Lacy says that most if the men in the area she knew from birth or they are related to her

A frustrated Sabina, who moved from Russia to Alaska at the age of 13, says that all she wants to do is put on heels and a dress and 'feel sexy'.

But because of the terrain, all of her meet-ups involve wearing a rain jacket and rubber boots.

And instead of being taken 'somewhere special', she usually ends up being entertained by men on their fishing boats.

In a bid to find 'a man with at least one ab', she and her girlfriends agree to pack their bags and fly over 5,000 miles to the Sunshine State.

'Weâ€™re on a mission to meet the men of our dreams,' Tina exclaims.

Once there, they go on a journey of discovery.

 get 'total Miami makeovers', which involve body mudpacks and waxing 
sessions, and they quickly ditch their layers for skimpy bikinis.

said she suffered from low confidence, is seen dressed in a raunchy 
lingerie set smiling at the camera.

However, as the six-part series progresses the women are seen arguing as emotions run high.

'We're like a pack of lions or something going after one gazelle,' 23-year-old Lacy says during one heated conversation.
