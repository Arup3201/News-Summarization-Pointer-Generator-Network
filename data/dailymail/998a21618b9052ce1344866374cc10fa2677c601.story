A mother raising her four children in a ninth-floor council flat has won a move after successfully arguing they could fall to their deaths.

Fartuuna Warsame waged a three-year battle with Birmingham City Council, which has now agreed to move her family on safety grounds.

The local authority hope that, by giving way before a court appeal was heard, it would avoid setting a legal precedent which would open the floodgates for demands for moves from high-rise flats.

New home: Mother Fartuuna Warsame won a battle against Birmingham City Council to get moved from a tower block as it was dangerous to live there

Mrs Warsame has lived in the flat in Thames Tower, Nechells, Birmingham, for seven years.

She said: 'This is such a relief. The ninth floor is no place to bring up young children.

'They can easily get the windows open. I dare not even go into another room. I told the council it would be responsible if a child fell.'

The single mother claimed she was stopped from fitting her own window locks in case of fire.

Her children are Aisha, eight, Rukaya, five, Aaliyah, two, and her baby Ridwan.

Last month a girl of two fell to her death from a third-floor flat in a Bristol tower block.

Danger: Mrs Warsame argued that it was unsafe to live with four children in a ninth-floor flat in this Birmingham block

Mrs Warsame's solicitor Mike Milvaney, of Community Law Partnership, said at times she had to leave her children alone in the flat as she struggled up the stairs with her baby and shopping.

He said: 'Councils must think carefully about continuing to leave or place young families with children in tower blocks.

'It is no answer to say that budget constraints and limited resources are to blame when young lives are at risk.

'The council has a moral and legal duty to consider the reasonableness of the accommodation provided.'

Battle: Mrs Warsame said: 'I dare not even go into another room. I told the council it would be responsible if a child fell'

A council spokesman said the decision was not binding on others.

He added: 'Due to the large number of flats in the city, a number of families live in similar properties, in line with the council's housing allocations policy.

'Though the family were given the right to be moved in this case, no admissions were made as to the merits of the appeal and the appeal was dismissed.'
