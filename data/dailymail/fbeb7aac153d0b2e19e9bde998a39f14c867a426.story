A blind woman has had her confidence shattered after a holiday company told her she would be unable to go on a flight because she would not be able to see the safety demonstration.

Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, has been left 'absolutely gutted' by holiday company Thomson, after she and friend Stephen Sherwood, 24, were told that they would need a carer with them on the plane.

The holiday company has since contacted Lauren's mother, Dawn,
 50, and said their staff will assist the two friends on the flight from
 Manchester Airport to Palma, Majorca, next Wednesday.

But Mrs Wigglesworth said her daughter, who was so desperate to get away on the break she canceled a planned operation, was now not confident enough to fly with them after the ordeal. 

U-turn: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were initially told that they couldn't fly with Thomson because they are blind

Lauren suffered mid-facial disfigurement in the womb because of 
complications with her mother's pregnancy when hormones stopped being 
produced.

The condition, which is genetic, left Lauren blind from birth. It is so rare that it is known to affect just 23 people in the world and doesn't have a name.

Thomson contacted her and said their 
staff would assist the two friends on the flight from Manchester Airport
 to Palma next Wednesday.

But Mrs Wigglesworth said her daughter would not be taking up the offer. She said: 'She is gutted.

'And I am, as a parent. It was a huge deal for her to be travelling alone. She will not be going on holiday with Thomson. She has lost all confidence.

'She does not feel confident enough to be able to go and fly with them.

'Thomson said that they will assist 
Lauren and Stephen on the plane. They got in touch and said they would 
put someone on the flight with them.

'There is no reason at all why 
Stephen and Lauren can't fly, the whole situation is ridiculous. He has 
flown on his own before and she gets the train all round the country on 
her own.'

She added: 'She was so excited about it. She had an operation planned for April 24, which she canceled so she could fly afterwards.

'It could have been all out the way by now. It was her dream holiday  for her - the first time she could go away and do things she wanted to do.

'She is devastated.'

Backed down: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, who has had a 
series of operations, has got her travel money ready for her holiday to Majorca

No go: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were told by Thomson it wasn't safe for them to fly because they are blind

The pair booked their £538 half-board five-night break at the the luxury C'an Picafort resort in January but were told two weeks ago that they couldn't go.

Lauren was so excited about her holiday 
that she had already bought all her holiday clothes, booked in to have 
her hair done and got her Euros - but then was told she couldn't go.

The
 holiday company insisted that 'we are not able to allow them to travel 
unaccompanied' but then offered the pair special assistance.

However, after reading of the pair's 
plight on the Mail Online, a company which specialises in holidays for 
the blind has apparently offered the friends a break - for free.

Mrs Wigglesworth said Traveleyes had 
contacted her and invited her daughter and friend away in August, an 
offer which she has accepted.

Dawn told the MailOnline: 'It sounds fantastic and it means she still gets to do what she wants to do most - travel independently. '

Thomson said: 'Both Ms Wigglesworth and her friend completed a special assistance form, in which they stated they would need assistance to complete a number of safety related actions, such as putting on a lifejacket, on board the aircraft.

'These requirements are taken from the Department of Transport’s Code of Practice that has been confirmed by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, to which Thomson and every other UK airline must adhere. 

'Unfortunately, as Ms Wigglesworth and her partner are not able to complete these without assistance, we were unfortunately unable to allow Ms Wigglesworth and her friend to travel alone safely on this occasion.  We understand that this must have been frustrating for her.

'With the departure dates being so close, and due to the delay in being able to inform Ms Wigglesworth she could not travel safely alone, as a gesture of goodwill we offered to organise a member of our Special Assistance Team to be present on the flight. 

'Our team member would have assisted Ms Wigglesworth and her friend in the unlikely event of an emergency situation, however Ms Wigglesworth has not accepted this offer.

'Ms Wigglesworth has accepted a full refund and as a further gesture of goodwill we have offered Ms Wigglesworth the money back for the travel insurance she paid for, which she has also accepted.'
