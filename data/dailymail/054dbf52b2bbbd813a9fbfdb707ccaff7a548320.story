Coronation Street star Barbara Knox, 80, has been with drink driving in Cheshire, police said today

Coronation Street actress Barbara Knox has been charged with drink-driving, police said this afternoon.

The 80-year-old, who plays Rita Tanner in the ITV soap, was charged by Cheshire police today after attending a police station to answer bail.

She was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence last month at Knutsford Police Station after going to visit her daughter, Maxine Ashcroft, 56, who had just been arrested for the same offence.

A Cheshire Police spokesman said: 'Police have charged an 80-year-old woman with drink driving following an incident in Knutsford on 10 March 2014.

'The woman turned up at Knutsford Police Station in relation to a separate matter and was arrested.'

He said Knox, of Knutsford, Cheshire, is due to appear before Macclesfield Magistrates' Court on 24 April.

Earlier this week, Knox's daughter, of Lechlade, Gloucestershire, was fined and banned from driving for two years after pleading guilty to drink-driving.

Magistrates in Macclesfield heard that Ashcroft was arrested after being stopped by police while driving home a relative, believed to be her actress mother, from a family gathering in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

Ashcroft's lawyer Nick 'Mr Loophole' Freeman said she had made a 'terrible error of judgement' in what was a 'classic case of alcohol anaesthetising good sense'.

He said the divorcee had recently moved from Cheshire to a more rural location in Gloucestershire where the nearest shop was six miles away.

Ashcroft was banned from driving for fined £960 and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a £96 victim surcharge.
