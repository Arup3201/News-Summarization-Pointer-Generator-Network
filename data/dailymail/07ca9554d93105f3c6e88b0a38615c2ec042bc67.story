The luxury residence that helped German bishop Franz Peter Tebartz-van Elst earn the nickname ‘The Bishop of Bling’ may be turned into a soup kitchen or refugee centre.

The complex in Limburg was renovated at a cost of 31 million-euros (£26.4 million), a figure that has sparked outrage in Germany.

However, it may now be used for the benefit of the needy, according to a newspaper report.

The Independent claims that Catholic officials want the sprawling property to be used to feed and house the poor.

Campaign
group Caritas told paper: ‘The residence is like an inherited sin which
the bishop has left in his wake. People who seek sanctuary with us 
could be given food in the residence.’

The outlay on the complex resulted in Tebartz-van Elst, 53, being formally suspended.

The
Vatican didn't say how long he would spend away from the diocese of 
Limburg but it refused calls to remove him permanently. It gave no 
information on where he would go or what he would do.

Tebartz-van
Elst has defended the expenditures on his residence, saying the bill 
was actually for 10 projects and there were additional costs because the
buildings were under historical protection.

But
in a country where Martin Luther launched the Reformation five 
centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses 
within the church, the outcry has been enormous.

The
perceived lack of financial transparency has also struck a chord since a
church tax in Germany brings in billions a year to the German church.

In a highly unusual move, Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst of Limburg was ordered to leave his diocese while an investigation and audit into cost over-runs is held

Tebartz-van
Elst's leadership style has also been criticised. In August and 
September, more than 4,000 people signed an open letter to the bishop 
criticising what they considered his authoritarian style.

The
head of the German bishops' conference, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, 
has been particularly blunt in his criticism of the expenditures and the
credibility problem it was causing the church.

He
said the 'decisive' turning point came when Hamburg prosecutors earlier
this month asked a court to levy an unspecified fine against the bishop
for false testimony in a related case.

Zollitsch
has said the church commission will investigate the costs of the 
renovation, the financing and how decisions about the restoration 
evolved.

Tebartz-van Elst's leadership style has also been criticized

Canon lawyers will determine if Tebartz-van Elst violated church law regarding the use of church money, Zollitsch said.

In a statement , Zollitsch pledged that the commission would do its work 'quickly and carefully.'

Francis' decision opens 'a space to return to inner calm and create a new basis for talks,' he said.

The
Vatican stressed that Francis took the decision based on 'objective' 
information, suggesting that the Vatican wasn't being swayed by the 
popular outcry. Francis has also made it clear he expects his bishops to
live simply, setting as an example his own humble lifestyle.

The
Vatican said the bishop was leaving pending the outcome of a German 
church investigation into the expenditures and his role in the affair.

Fellow bishops and lay Catholics in the diocese, however, expressed doubt that he would ever be able to return.

'This is a crisis of confidence that will be hard to overcome,' said the dean of the cathedral chapter, Guenther Geis.

Limburg's
vicar general, the Rev. Wolfgang Roesch, who had been due to start 
January 1, will instead begin work immediately and will run the diocese 
during Tebartz-van Elst's absence, the Vatican said.

Germany's main lay Catholic group, the Central Committee of German Catholics, praised the decision.

'Pope
Francis' decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new 
beginning in the Limburg diocese, because the situation had become an 
increasing burden for the faithful there and in all of Germany,' said 
Alois Glueck, the group's head.

The German government refused to comment on the matter.

Franz-Josef
Bode, bishop of Osnabrueck, said the pope had made a 'smart' decision 
which gives all concerned time to review the situation calmly. But in 
comments to the German newspaper Die Welt, he cast doubt on Tebartz-van 
Elst ever returning to Limburg.

'There is a fundamental crisis of confidence in Limburg. The situation there is a mess,' Bode was quoted as saying.
