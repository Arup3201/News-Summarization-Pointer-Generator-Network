She has been portrayed as a ‘royal benefits scrounger’, a holidaying princess who lives a life of idle luxury at the taxpayer’s expense.

But last night Princess Beatrice took the unusual step of responding to the criticism, telling friends that she is about to accept one of several job offers following the end of her post at Sony Pictures.

Prince Andrew’s eldest daughter is said to have been very upset to find herself accused of being workshy after quitting her £20,000-a-year job before taking three holidays in as many weeks.

In fact, it seems that the Princess was an unexpected victim of the attacks on Sony’s security system, presumed to have been made by North Korea, in December.

Unfair: Princess Beatrice has hit out at claims that she is 'workshy' after quitting her job at Sony

A friend of the Princess said last night that Sony bosses insisted she and other employees take time off.

‘Beatrice’s job was semi closed down by North Korea when her social security details were splashed all over the pages of American newspapers,’ he said. As a result of the hacking, she resigned.

Beatrice, 26, has since been approached by headhunters, resulting in two job offers, one with a reputable technology company, and a further two interviews.

Sony is also said to be attempting to persuade her to stay with them by offering to promote her above her current position.

The friend said: ‘Beatrice has got another two interviews next week and she is not scared of hard work. She’s in her mid-20s and is trying to build up work experience with financial companies and start-ups.

‘She has done plenty of work experience, so she can forge a serious career with lots of skills.’

Last night, a friend of the family spoke out, telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘This is like going back to the Tudor times when some people attacked the Yorks, and we are not going to tolerate it.’

A close friend of the Duchess of York added: ‘The Duchess is incredibly protective of her daughters and may well make a robust statement defending them.

‘She will not accept unfair treatment of her girls. One of the reasons Princess Eugenie went to New York to work was to escape the intense spotlight in the UK media.

‘On top of her day job, Beatrice can also say she works for her grandmother, the Queen, and has on occasion attended charity events at Buckingham Palace in her lunch hour.’

Beatrice on holiday with pals in St Barts

A friend of Beatrice said: ‘How dare people attack her for not working hard when she does exactly that in her office for charities and for the Royal Family?’

Beatrice, 26, is said to be very passionate about the six charities of which she is a patron, including The Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre and Big Change, a charity founded by her close friends Sam and Holly Branson.

The Princess carried out ten Royal engagements last year while also working for Sony, and in November Beatrice and her mother attended a charity fundraiser at Lancaster House, held in aid of the Northwood African Education Foundation.

Beatrice is patron of the charity and helped to raise £150,000 that night.

As the sixth in line to the throne, Beatrice is constantly monitored by security guards, paid for by her father. She receives no public funds for her accommodation or lifestyle.

Last month, she and boyfriend Dave Clark, 32, took a trip to the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents own a £13 million chalet, and visited the Caribbean island of St Barts twice.

But the new claims suggest she took the trips in the expectation that February would bring a more important job with a healthier wage.

Buckingham Palace has insisted that the Princess’s travel is always ‘entirely privately funded’ often with help from her parents and sometimes Mr Clark, who earns a six-figure salary at Virgin Galactic.

Catherine Mayer, wrote the new Prince Charles book

Charles Crushes biographer's claim: Palace says writer had NO special access to the Prince 

by Robert Jobson, Royal Commentator

The office of Prince Charles has distanced itself from claims that a controversial new book was written with its co-operation.

American Catherine Mayer says she met the Prince and spoke to his closest aides while researching Charles: The Heart Of A King.

A journalist with Time magazine, Ms Mayer paints a picture of Clarence House torn apart by turf wars and describes the future King grappling with insecurities and struggling to control his courtiers and their infighting.

But Kristina Kyriacou, Prince Charles’s head of communications, said yesterday that the publishers had overplayed suggestions of official co-operation. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is not an official book. The author did not have the access as claimed. Clarence House has no further comment.’

Royal sources said Ms Mayer did attend a dinner with the Prince, but was one of 75 guests and had no access to the top table.

Like other journalists, she joined the Royal rota to cover Prince Charles at work. To suggest there was intimate access is overblown.

Ms Mayer’s biography is one of three forthcoming books claiming to offer new detail about Charles, including one by American Sally Bedell Smith, who has written biographies on the Queen and Princess Diana. One source said there seemed to be a ‘race’ between the two women to publish first.

‘Perhaps that is why Catherine Mayer is claiming to have had more access than she did. Both books are unofficial,’ he said.

Tony Blair’s former spin-doctor Alastair Campbell is also bringing out a book which claims to have new information about Charles.

Publishers say Ms Mayer’s book reveals ‘a man in sight of happiness yet still driven by anguish’ with ‘views that mean he will never be as impartial as his mother’.

Ms Mayer’s book – extracts of which were published on Kindle and in The Times yesterday – suggests Clarence House is riddled with ‘glaring systemic weaknesses’.

She also writes that any criticism of the Prince, who is known to courtiers as ‘the Boss’, can send him spiralling into ‘despair’, while turf battles between Charles’s staff ‘are common and bloody’.

‘One former householder refers to Clarence House as Wolf Hall,’ she says. According to Ms Mayer, much difficulty is caused by Charles’s inability to create clear roles for his staff. He is accused of causing turf wars by failing to set courtiers clear boundaries.

But close sources dismiss these claims. ‘Anyone who visits Clarence House always say what a happy ship it is. The staff don’t recognise Mayer’s claims.

‘It is convenient, isn’t it, that the television adaptation of Wolf Hall is doing well now as the book comes out.’

Distance: Charles with PR Chief Kristina Kyriacou, who says new book by Catherine Mayer, left, is not official

Despite his current PR headaches, Charles is continuing to trust press team leader Kristina Kyriacou with nurturing his public image.

Kyriacou, 48, has recently signed a new contract and a source said: ‘The Prince is delighted. She is the bedrock of his communications team.’
