For the first time since 50,000 Geordies hissed their deafening disapproval and forced him to retreat to his dugout, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew returned to St James’ Park.

After five minutes he made his first tentative steps into the technical area which had been the scene of his public persecution three months ago.

Given the sedate setting of a pre-season friendly, however, he escaped a repeat of such vitriol.

It had been during the 3-0 victory over Cardiff in May – Pardew’s first game back on the home touchline following his ban for butting Hull’s David Meyler — that supporters had turned on him.

Has the passage of the summer and the arrival of nine signings won Pardew a reprieve? Does he feel relations have been repaired? We do not know, for the club are refusing to allow their boss to speak to the press, and therefore the fans.

He did offer — via his programme notes — that he was happy with the ‘healthy’ nature of his squad. But that team barely raised a pulse during a subdued and sodden 90 minutes which left fans pining for the start of competitive action. That comes on Sunday when champions Manchester City visit St James’, and only then will we get a measure of fans’ forgiveness.

For the feeling on Tyneside is that they remain ready to turn, regardless of new investment.

Pardew, though, is happy with the £35million backing from owner Mike Ashley this close-season, as he wrote: ‘We came up short at times last season, but everyone has worked hard to ensure we have a team that will represent this great club in a fitting manner over the coming months, and I’m relishing the prospect of what lies ahead.

‘The squad we have assembled is healthy in terms of numbers, experience and quality and that is all any manager can ask for when he is looking ahead to a long and arduous marathon.’

Long and arduous was one way to describe yesterday’s friendly. For even by pre-season standards it was a tedious affair.

Moussa Sissoko was the match-winner following a dreadful performance which was about as far removed as imaginable from his impressive showing at the World Cup with France.

With two minutes remaining Gabriel Obertan attacked the by-line and drew back to Sissoko’s unmarked feet on the edge of the area. Given how he had performed until that point, those in the Gallowgate End would have been forgiven had they ducked for cover.

But Sissoko kept his composure and produced the game’s one moment of quality, tucking into the bottom corner with authority.

Next Sunday against City should feature five full debutants from their summer splurge but Pardew can afford no bedding-in period with those new faces. The pressure will be on from the off and, unable to communicate with the fans except via sanitised, official outlets, his existence could again be a lonely one should results not go his way.

Skipper Fabricio Coloccini certainly feels the arrival of new faces has reinvigorated a squad which, in light of Yohan Cabaye’s £20m sale in January and no subsequent investment, had grown disillusioned with the direction of the club.

‘The new arrivals have given everyone a lift,’ he said. ‘They are good guys and, most importantly, they are good players who have added even more quality to the team.’

Remy Cabella looks the pick of them and the France midfielder was again the stand-out performer against Sociedad. The 23-year-old brings guile and energy to a side sadly lacking in both departments last season and he could well be the next player to use the Magpies as a launchpad to greater things.

In the meantime Pardew will be looking to Cabella — and the likes of former Ajax captain Siem de Jong and Holland defender Daryl Janmaat — to win him a few friends among the Toon Army.

For while he is unhappy with the silence imposed upon him by the club’s hierarchy, should the home fans remain equally muted when he returns to his technical zone against City, Pardew will be a relieved man.
