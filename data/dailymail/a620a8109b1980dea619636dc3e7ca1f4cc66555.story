Pushing down prices: Thousands of shoppers have flocked to discount chains such as Lidl

Discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl have forced average shop prices down at the steepest rate for eight years, figures reveal.

The overall price of clothing and consumer goods fell by 1.8 per cent last month compared with the previous June.

And the figures from the British Retail Consortium/Nielsen shop price index show the price of clothes was down by 13.7 per cent year-on-year.

The price of food rose by 0.6 per cent in June, but this was the lowest level of inflation since the index began.

Once the mainstay of the working classes, cheap discount stores now have discerning shoppers with a wide range of incomes among their regular customers.

The rise of German chains Aldi and Lidl saw hundreds of thousands of customers ditch the ‘Big Four’ supermarkes, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Morrisons, which have seen a race-to-the-bottom price slashing.

It means consumers are benefiting from the fastest drop in prices since the trade association began compiling data in 2006.

Helen Dickinson, British Retail Consortium director general, said: ‘June saw plenty of good news for cash-conscious customers, and confirms that retailers have continued to work hard to help budgets go that bit further over the summer.

‘This is the deepest level of deflation in non-food and the lowest rate of inflation for food since 2006 when our records began.

‘Added to this, we see that consumer confidence is at its highest level since April 2005.’

She said that the supermarket price wars, triggered when Morrisons slashed its charges for 1,200 basic products by up to 60 per cent in May to take on the German discounters, was behind the record figures.

Mrs Dickinson said: ‘Fierce competition among grocers has driven food price inflation to record low levels and with some grocers having announced plans to keep prices down, consumers stand to benefit for a while to come.’

She continued: ‘The backdrop was equally promising with  stable commodity markets  and the continued strength  of sterling suggesting inflation is set to remain low in the medium term.

‘Although of course, a strong pound is not so good for  those retailers exporting, one exciting and growing area in British retail.

‘However, it is clear that retailers are making sure these positive economic benefits in the home market are being passed on to consumers while they themselves will cheer on the very low Producer Price Index – an indication of the cost pressures they face.

‘While the economic recovery continues to gather pace it was not all good news as household disposable incomes remain under pressure.

‘Interestingly, while wage rises remain lacklustre throughout the economy, the squeeze on disposable incomes is not  coming from retail but other areas if the economy such as leisure and recreational activities.

‘With shop price inflation at a record low this is undoubtedly an excellent time to go out and find a bargain.’
