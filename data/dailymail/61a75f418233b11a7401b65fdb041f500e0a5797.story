Surfing's elite came out in force today to take on the enormous waves  at Praia do Norte in Nazare, Portugal.

The weather forecast predicted three days of solid swells off the coast of the small fishing village, with readings as high as 41 feet on the first day.

Nazare is where US surfer Garrett McNamara, one of many in attendance on December 11, set the world record of having surfed the largest wave - 30 metres - in January 2013.

The massive waves are caused, in large part, by the region's geography - off the Praia do Norte coastline is the biggest underwater ravine in Europe, called Nazare Canyon.

The huge canyon runs 125 miles, from out in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to less than half a mile from the coastline.

Praia do Norte is also among one of the most westerly points in all of Europe, meaning that the wind, along with the ocean swell caused by the canyon, sweeps across the Atlantic unhindered, adding even more fuel to the gigantic wave potential.
