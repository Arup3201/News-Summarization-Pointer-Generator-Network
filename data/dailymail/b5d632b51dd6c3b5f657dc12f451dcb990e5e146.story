Tony the Tourist: Tony Blair enjoys the nightlife in Saint Tropez, France, on Saturday before heading to Sardinia

He boasted recently of having ‘toiled over years’ to bring peace to the Middle East – and wrote of his concern at the ‘living nightmare’ in Syria.

But if Tony Blair was toiling in his role as Special Envoy to the long-troubled region last week, it is apparently nice work if you can get it.

While western governments reacted with fury to claims of a chemical weapons attack in Damascus and made moves towards launching air strikes on Syrian regime forces, the ex-Prime Minister was spotted in some of the most glamorous locations in the Mediterranean.

Mr Blair’s busy schedule at the back end of last week involved  visiting several ‘super-yachts’ worth in excess of £100million – apparently three of them in the space of three days.

He is officially the Special Envoy for the Middle East on behalf of the Quartet – the United Nations, European Union, United Sates and Russia – with a brief to help broker peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.

But his role might be expected to see him take a wider interest in the region, and indeed the latest post on his official website – ‘There is hope amid the turmoil of the Middle East’.

It is dated August 4 – makes several references to Syria, where the chemical attack was first reported on Wednesday.

But a day later, on Thursday, Mr Blair jetted into Sardinia on a private jet, and was whisked away to dine at a restaurant in the glamorous resort of Porto Rotondo.

Mr Blair, 60, is familiar with this idyllic spot, having famously visited with wife Cherie in 2004 for a free holiday at the 27-bedroom villa of since-disgraced Italian premier and billionaire Silvio Berlusconi.

That jolly was much remarked on at the time – both because Labour MPs were appalled at their leader accepting hospitality from such a sleazy Right-wing host, and the fact Berlusconi sported a ridiculous bandana during their public appearances, to conceal the aftermath of a hair transplant.

On his latest visit Mr Blair enjoyed the hospitality of a different billionaire. For after his evening meal last Thursday, he stepped on to a swish motor launch and was ferried out to board a magnificent 377ft super-yacht, the Pelorus, the 16th-largest gin palace in the world.

Previously owned by Russian billionaire 
and Chelsea football club-owner Roman Abramovich, it was given to his 
ex-wife Irina two years ago as part of their £200million divorce 
settlement.

All aboard: Mr Blair spent Thursday evening on the Pelorus, owned by U.S. music mogul David Geffen, worth over £150million

It is now owned by American music mogul David Geffen, 70, one of the few people in the world with enough money to pay the 46 crew the yacht needs – and to hand over the £150million-plus the pleasure craft reportedly cost him. Remarkably, the Pelorus is Mr Geffen’s easy-to-berth runaround – his main yacht is the 453ft Rising Sun.

News of Mr Blair’s enthusiasm for the billionaire’s yachts emerged a year ago, when it was reported that he had been seen on board one of them off Corfu.

And on his latest stay on board a Geffen craft, Mr Blair seems to have taken the opportunity to visit an even bigger yacht – as onlookers last Thursday saw it draw alongside the Topaz, at 483ft the sixth largest in the world.

No worries: The former Prime Minister appeared to have other things on his mind as reports came from Damascus about chemical weapons attacks

Tony Blair today demanded that Britain and the United States launch military action in Syria.

The
 former Prime Minister compared the violent Ashar al-Assad regime and 
its murdering of its own citizens with chemical weapons to the 'dark 
days of Saddam'.

Mr Blair, who took Britain to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, said this morning that it is 'time we took sides'.

'People
 wince at the thought of intervention. But contemplate the future 
consequence of inaction and shudder,' he wrote in The Times.

This morning David Cameron returned early from his Cornish holiday to consider whether to recall Parliament. MPs are demanding a binding vote over plans to launch missile strikes on Syria without the backing of the United Nations.

Mr Blair urged the Government to ignore 'the impulse to stay clear of turmoil'.

'I
 understand every impulse to stay clear of the turmoil, to watch but not
 to intervene, to ratchet up language but not to engage in the hard, 
even harsh business of changing reality on the ground.

'But we have collectively to understand the consequences of wringing our hands instead of putting them to work.'

Owned by the royal family of the United Arab Emirates, it is valued at a colossal £340million, has eight decks, and even a choice of swimming pools.

Pleasant though his surroundings were, Mr
 Blair soon moved on. And on Saturday he was spotted in the perennial 
playground of the international playboy, St Tropez.

On land he was surrounded by a team of ever-watchful security guards, but seemed to relax when back on the ocean wave, this time on a motorised launch of the new hi-tech super-yacht Crazy Me.

Mr Blair had been on Pampelonne beach, where fashion tycoon Sir Philip Green was throwing a party at the Bar D’O for guests including Simon Cowell.

The former premier was not a guest, instead dining at the Les Palmier restaurant, but clearly had bigger fish to fry – for he had a broad grin as he was whisked away by four smartly uniformed crew on a launch from his third super-yacht of the weekend.

Crazy Me is 167ft long and crafted entirely from aluminium with ‘an aggressive and unique profile’. She boasts both a master suite and a VIP stateroom, and has a glass-bottomed swimming pool on the upper deck. Only recently completed, she was delivered to her mystery owner in June.

Last night a spokesman for Mr Blair refused to discuss who he had been visiting or what he had been doing on the series of super-yachts in the Mediterranean while the Syrian crisis unfolded.

The tight-lipped spokesman would add only that ‘he was having meetings with various people’.
