Archaeologists have been left stumped after the remains of a Pacific walrus were found buried among human skeletons in a churchyard near London's St Pancras train station.

The nine bones of the four-metre long animal were found inside a coffin with eight other sets of human remains, including three skulls, dating back to around 1822.

Researchers from Ramboll Cultural Heritage and Archaeology initially made the discovery
 in 2003 but following detailed studies of the bones, as well as 
searching through zoological records, the team has not found any conclusive proof as to how the animal arrived in the UK.

Archaeologists have been left stumped after the remains of a Pacific walrus was found buried among human skeletons in a churchyard near London's St Pancras train station. The remains of the animal, pictured, were found inside a coffin with eight other sets of human remains, including three skulls, dating back to around 1822

According to Phil Emery's book St Pancras burial ground: excavations for St Pancras International, the London terminus of High Speed 1, 2002–3, the churchyard was extended several times during the post-medieval period.

This created the 'New Burying Ground’ in 1792 and the last burial took place in 1854.

Emery's study concentrated on the ‘Third Ground’, where 1383 burials were thought to have taken place. 

He told the MailOnline that a rise in cholera, typhus and small pox at the time led to the high rate of burials.

Analysis included reconstruction of coffin stack sequences within known burial rows, illustrated in 3D.

A sample of 715 burials underwent 'full osteological analysis, revealing a heterogeneous population buried during a time of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation.'

Well-preserved human bones and coffins were found and many of the coffin plates were inscribed with biographical detail.

Refugees from the French Revolution as well as three aristocrats were among the discovery, alongside the remains of a Pacific walrus and a dissected tortoise.

They believe all the bones inside the 
mysterious coffin may have been used for medical science by one of the 
40 anatomy schools in London open during the 19th Century.

The burial ground was discovered during excavations of the station when the Eurostar terminal moved from Waterloo to St Pancras in 2003.

The research team was lead by archaeologist Phil Emery and was funded by High Speed 1.

The walrus bones, as well as the human remains discovered in the coffin, all showed signs of being cut up and dissected for medical research.

Many of the remains showed cuts and scrapes consistent with dissection, which was legalised by the Anatomy Act of 1832, and at least one of the human skulls discovered showed signs of 'cranial autopsy' - drilling into the brain.

Emery, along with Alan Pipe from the 
Museum of London Archaeology, studied the bones and looked at London 
Zoological Society records for any clues as to how the bones arrived on 
the site.

In their book, St Pancras burial ground: excavations for St Pancras International, the London terminus of High Speed 1, 2002–3, Emery and Pipe said: 'The animal bone consisted of a small, moderately-preserved group of eight bones derived from a walrus of a very large size and robust build.

'The sample includes bones from a lower 
fore-limb, a fore-foot, first and second metacarpal, the lower hind 
limbs, fibula, calcaneum, astragalus and first cuneiform. These bones 
are significantly larger than their reference equivalents held at the 
Narual History Museum.

'Microscopic examination revealed that all the St Pancras walrus bones show some degree of surface erosion and butchery marks. Three clear superficial transverse knife cuts were noted.'

Mr Emery told MailOnline: 'The way that the walrus bones were found among the skeletal remains suggests they would have been used as a teaching collection from a research institution.

These remains are the Pacific walrus' back right leg and ankle. The walrus bones, as well as the human remains discovered in the coffin, all showed signs of being cut up and dissected for medical research including knife cuts

'Historical accounts of animal 
dissections show that in 1853, Professor Owen from the London Zoological
 Society carried out medical research on a walrus.'

This could have been the walrus found buried in St Pancras, yet Mr Emery and his team have not been able to categorically confirm this to be the case.

He believes the 
coffin with the walrus bones dates between 1822 and 1854 because it 
was found in a horizontal burial trench.

Up until November 1822, burials were carried out on a plot-by-plot basis before the trench method was introduced.

Mr Emery added that this was also the 
year when the old St Pancras church lost its status and the new St 
Pancras church was used in its place - this would have created an 
upheaval of bones and burials.

Walruses are hunted and killed for 
their skin and ivory tusks and the animal found beneath St Pancras 
station may have also been brought to the UK for trade.

The
 remains of the St Pancras walrus are on display at the London 
Archaeological Archive and Research Centre in Hackney, East London. All 
the human remains have been reburied.

Father James Elston is currently seeking funding for repairs to the St Pancras Old Church on the site of the dig.

Based on the remains, pictured, the walrus is believed to have been around four metres long. This was quoted by Emery as 'significantly larger than their reference equivalents held at the Natural History Museum.' The remains are on display at London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre in Hackney, East London
