Nearly six decades after it first aired, an I Love Lucy Christmas special was last week's most-watched holiday program.

There was a gimmick involved: The episode of the 1950s Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz sitcom was colorized.

A companion episode that featured Lucy as a grape-stomper in Italy also went from black-and-white to color.

Lucille Ball, who died in 1989, played a housewife with aspirations of showbiz fame. Arnaz, her real-life husband, played a bandleader who always offered a shoulder to cry on when her schemes met with inevitable disaster.

Ball said it was her belief in her character that made her popular.

The Nielsen company said on Tuesday that the I Love Lucy special on CBS drew 8.7 million viewers to rank as last Friday night's most-watched program.

Runner-up A Charlie Brown Christmas - a relative newcomer that debuted in 1965 - settled for 6.4 million the night before on ABC.

CBS was the most-watched network. But NBC was the most popular among advertiser-favored young adults with help from The Voice finale and the NFL Bears-Eagles game on Sunday Night Football.

Earlier this year, a polka dot dress Lucille Ball wore on the show, which aired from 1951 to 1957, sold at a Hollywood auction for an incredible $168,000.

The pink and brown garment was expected to rake in between $40,000 and $60,000, but one I Love Lucy enthusiast was apparently willing to part with much more for the iconic relic.

The dress is a long, brown silk gown cinched around the waist, with a white collar and light pink polka dots.

I Love Lucy won five Emmy Awards and was the most popular U.S TV show for four of the six seasons that it aired, between 1951 and 1960.
