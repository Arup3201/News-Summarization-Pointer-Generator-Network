Toronto Mayor Rob Ford today admitted he's used 'every drug you can probably think of' - but insisted he's only ever used alcohol in his office.

The beleaguered mayor, who returned to City Hall on Monday after nearly two months in rehab, said in an interview with CBC that he's used cocaine, marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms.

'You name it, I've abused it,' he said - but later clarified that he has not used heroin.

In an astonishing moment, Ford admitted: 'I was born with blond hair, I'll die with blond hair. I was born 
with this disease, I'm going to die with this disease.'

Revelations: In his first sit-down interview since returning to city hall, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford admitted he had consumed alcohol in his office - but denied ever taking drugs there

Yet despite his admission, Ford said he wants to stand for re-election in October, claiming it is up to the people of Toronto whether he has a future as mayor.

He acknowledged he had smoked crack when
 reporter Dwight Drummond held up a picture showing him with what 
appeared to be a crack pipe, but he denied that he was a crack addict.

Ford insisted that he consumed the drugs in his 'personal time' but did admit to drinking while in his City Hall office.

In police interviews last fall, Ford's former executive assistant Kia Nejatian said he had found a marijuana joint in Fordâ€™s desk drawer at city hall, throwing doubts on his claims.

He also blamed the substance abuse for the racist and homophobic language he's used in the past.

'I think that goes along with having this disease,' he said. 'You do things, you say things that aren't you. I take full responsibility. All I can do is apologise and deal with this disease. This is an everyday battle. This is the beginning of a long journey.'

He went 
on: 'I was born with blond hair, I'll die with blond hair. I was born 
with this disease, I'm going to die with this disease.'

Ford
 repeatedly refused to say whether he'd resign if he falls of the wagon 
again and that he wouldn't be giving up his job to give himself time to 
deal with his substance abuse issues.

Asked if that was good enough for the people of Toronto, Ford said it would be up to them to decide in the October 27 election.

'I'm taking one day at a time. I did not drink yesterday, I haven't drunk today,' Ford said.

Ford acknowledged last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor'.

His reign as mayor has been marred by revelations about his drinking problems and illegal drug use. But he insisted he's been abusing drugs and alcohol for years and said his job is not what drove him to abuse substances.

'I love my job and keeping busy is the best thing for me,' he said.

Ford had entered the GreeneStone facility in Ontario on May 1 to be treated for alcohol addition after announcing in April that he was seeking treatment.

He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials.
