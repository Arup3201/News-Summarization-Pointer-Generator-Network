Police in California have arrested a female suspect over the death of a 23-year-old woman who was brutally beaten as she waited in line outside a Santa Ana club on Saturday night.

The victim, identified by friends as Kim
 Pham, was declared brain dead following the attack in Santa Ana in the 
early hours of Saturday and relatives told KTLA on Monday that she had passed away.

The suspect hasn't been named, but is described as in her 20s and has been arrested for suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and causing great bodily harm. She was identified thanks to video footage of the attack filmed by a bystander.

Attacked: Kim Pham was knocked to the ground and beaten by a group of men and women outside a club in Santa Ana, California early on Saturday morning. She was left brain dead after the attack

Plea: Posters put near the crime scene appealing for information about the tragic January incident

'People have come forward that have provided us with videos and have come in and provided statements that have given detectives enough information to believe that this person was involved in at least the physical part of this altercation,' said Santa Ana Police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna of the suspect.

Police are still looking for the four other suspects - two woman and two men - who are believed to have been involved in the heinous attack.

On Facebook, Kim's sister Katie described her as a ‘beautiful, eloquent, and respectful person.’

Authorities are urging witnesses or anyone with any information about the attack to come forward.

Downtown, Inc., a group of local Santa Ana leaders, business owners and residents, and representatives from the venue where the incident took place are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of the individuals responsible for Pham's attack.

She was waiting with friends outside The Crosby, a club in downtown Santa Ana, when an argument broke out with another woman, whose friends then stepped in.

Brutal: A video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground

'Two or three of the female suspects knocked her to the ground, were 
physically assaulting her and kicking her, and they fled the scene,' Santa Ana Police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told KABC.

CBS
 Los Angeles reported that a bouncer tried to break up the fight but was
 unable to. When the assailants ran away, Pham was left unconscious on 
the ground.

She was 
rushed to hospital and listed in extremely critical condition, but on 
Sunday, her sister wrote on her Facebook page that doctors had confirmed
 Pham was brain dead.

Hours later, her sister shared a link on Facebook saying that her sister had been murdered. Santa Ana Police have not yet confirmed Pham's death.

But authorities are appealing for witnesses to come forward with footage of the attack after receiving reports that club-goers had taken out their cell phones.

One video posted on Facebook claims to be from a friend of the victim, although authorities have not yet confirmed its veracity.

The 10-second clip shows a person lying on the floor as they are surrounded by a group of people. A guard can be seen attempting to separate the crowd as witnesses look on, horrified.

Bertagna added that authorities were looking for 'a group of five individuals that
 are only described as three females, two males, all Hispanic between 20
 and 25 years of age'.

Violent Police say a fight broke out between Pham and another woman, whose friends then stepped in

No arrests have yet been made.

Memorial posters and flowers were placed outside the club, and friends and relatives spread posters online pleading for information into the attack.

A donation page was also set up for the family, but Pham's sister later said that they did not want to receive donations and would be returning the money.

‘I can't believe something like this would happen to someone, especially my cousin,’ said Kathleen Trinh. ‘She was always a fun loving person. She has a bubbly personality. Anyone that's around her is always happy, she has an uplifting spirit.’

Pham's friend Johnson Lam described her as 'really educated, smart.'

'She has a lot of friends, you know, and everybody loves her, everybody likes her, and she's very sweet and kind-hearted,’ she said,

The Crosby is also helping investigators and has posted a message on its Facebook page urging witnesses to contact authorities. It does not have any security footage of the attack.

Anyone with any information is urged to call the Santa Ana Police Department at (714) 245-839. You can also call OC Crime Stoppers at (855) TIP-OCCS.
