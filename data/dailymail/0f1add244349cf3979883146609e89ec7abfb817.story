Tony Blair has warned Ed Miliband not to resort to the ‘politics of anger’ by seeking to inflict ever-increasing taxes on the wealthy.

The former prime minister told the Labour leader that taxing the rich more ‘won’t necessarily change the nature of your society’.

And he failed to apologise for the rise of the super-rich during his time in Downing Street, saying it was ‘the way the world goes’ for some people to do better than others.

Warning: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has warned Labour leader Ed Miliband that taxing the rich more 'won't necessarily change the nature of your society'

Mr Miliband, the son of a Marxist academic, has sought to draw a line under the New Labour era, with warnings about the danger of ‘predator’ capitalism and against ‘tolerating the wealthiest taking what they can’.

However, in an interview with The Times yesterday, Mr Blair – who is worth an estimated £80 million – also appeared keen to distance himself from his successor.

‘There are two types of politics today: the politics of the anger and the politics of the answer,’ he said.

‘I prefer the politics of the answer. If you take the money off the people at the top it won’t necessarily change the nature of your society.’

Echoing Peter Mandelson’s boast that New Labour was ‘intensely relaxed’ about people making lots of money, Mr Blair added: ‘There are always going to be times when some people do better than others in terms of financial wealth – that’s the way the world goes. Always has been, always will be.

‘My anxiety wasn’t to stop a footballer or a pop star making a lot of money – it was to make sure that a kid on a poor estate got a decent education and start in life.’
