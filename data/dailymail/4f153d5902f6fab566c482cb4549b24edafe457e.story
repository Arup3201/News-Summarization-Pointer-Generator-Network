A man has today been cleared of murdering his wife on honeymoon to claim more than £130,000 on her life insurance policy.

Collette Davies, 39, from Bridgend, 
south Wales, plunged 80ft to her death from a viewing platform over a 
steep gorge at an Indian beauty spot in February 2004.

John Clifton Davies, 51, of Milton 
Keynes, in Buckinghamshire, walked free from court after spending the 
last 16 months in custody.

He was accused of murdering his wife in 2004, 14 months after they wed and while they were a week into the dream holiday.

Mr Davies was also accused of making 'fake representation' by fraudulently claiming an insurance payment of £132,000 after her death.

But the prosecution at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday offered no evidence against Mr Davies after new witnesses came forward. 

Mr and Mrs Davies and her husband were married in 2003 and went on a delayed honeymoon to India 14 months later. Her body was found in a ravine  near the town of Gaura.

Police in India investigated the death at the time and concluded that there were no suspicious circumstances.

Her body was flown back to her home town of Bridgend, South Wales, where she was cremated after an inquest recorded an open verdict.

But a fresh police inquiry was launched and Davies, of Milton Keynes, Bucks, was arrested and charged in November 2011.

South Wales Police reviewed the case after consultation with the family and an incident room was set up.

Officers also travelled to India and visited the spot, near the town of Gaura, where her body was found at the foot of a ravine.

They also re-interviewed more than a dozen witnesses before returning to Britain.

Felicity Galvin, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales, said: 'We have been working closely with South Wales Police as their investigation into the 2004 death of Colette Davies has developed.

'In November 2011 we advised that, based on the evidence available at that time Davies should be charged with murder and two counts of fraud.

'As is normal in cases such as this, the police investigation continued after charges were laid. 'As part of that investigation, officers from South Wales Police recently visited the Himachal Pradesh region of India.

'During that visit the police became aware of significant new information from two people, who had not previously come forward, who could potentially provide direct eyewitness evidence.

The village tandy, in Himachal Pradesh, India. Officers travelled to India and visited the spot, near the town of Gaura, where her body was found at the foot of a ravine. But prosecution at Cardiff Crown Court offered no evidence against Mr Davies after new witnesses came forward

'This new information could be said to undermine the prosecution case. In the light of these developments the CPS reviewed the case again.

'We concluded that the evidential requirements are no longer met in relation to both the murder and fraud charges.

'As a result, prosecution counsel has formally advised the court that we are offering no evidence against John Clifton Davies in this case.'
