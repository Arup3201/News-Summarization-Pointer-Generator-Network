Dr Fiona Cornish has warned that the system is under too much strain

Rising numbers of family doctors are quitting because they can’t face ‘five days a week of full-on clinical work’, a top GP has claimed.

Dr Fiona Cornish said family doctors were ‘burning out’ because they are seeing patients and working in their surgery for up to 12 hours a day, as well as dealing with mounds of paperwork at the end of the day.

GPs are struggling with the stresses of looking after elderly patients with complicated illnesses, she added, comparing the pressure they are under to those of high-flying City workers.

She also predicted many surgeries will go bust over the next year while others may have to lay off staff leading to ‘dangerously’ long waits for appointments.

Although GPs benefited from a contract in 2004 that led to salaries soaring to £105,000 a year despite not having to work evenings and weekends, their morale has plummeted in recent years.

They say the workload is now harder as patients are elderly and more demanding whilst at the same time the Government has cut their funding so they have to do more with less.

Dr Cornish, president of the Medical Women’s Society, an influential body of female doctors, said: ‘We have a toxic trio – an ageing population, shrinking resources and patients becoming more demanding.

Dr Cornish says GPs can spend 12 hours a day on patient consultations before even starting their paperwork

‘GPs are burning out and each GP then has to do more. GPs have had enough, we can’t do it any more.

‘In a busy day you’d have about 60 consultations either face to face or over the phone. There’s a limit to how much you can do in a day.

‘Diminishing numbers of men or women can take five days a week of full-on clinical work seeing patients for 12 hours a day.

David Cameron has pledged to increase funding to GP surgeries by £50m to help pay for longer opening hours

‘More and more doctors are burning out and leaving the profession early, in the same way that City workers retire in their fifties, often for health reasons.’

Last month a survey of 3,000 family doctors by their union, the British Medical Association, found that six in ten planned to retire early because it was too stressful. Dr Cornish, 53, who is married with four children, also warned that many smaller, family-run practices would go bust over the next few years due to a lack of Government funding.

She predicted that in future, patients will be under the care of large centres run by private firms working for the NHS.

‘It’s the end of the family doctor as we know it. We will just end up with Virgin Care doctors in supermarket set ups. Large centres just running on a business.’

She also warned funding cuts would lead to a squeeze on staff: ‘Practices will have to lay off nurses, lay off staff and then it becomes unsafe.

‘When you have a two week waiting time for a routine appointment that is dangerous. We just can’t keep up.’ Last month a survey of 11,000 patients commissioned by the Mail found that many were waiting between three and four weeks to see their GP.

The Prime Minister this month promised to give GP surgeries an extra £50 million to open more at evenings and weekends, but their union warned this money would not be enough to make a significant difference.

New rules: Mr Hunt meets a patient at London's King's College Hospital

Jeremy Hunt last night vowed to stop the NHS wasting millions of pounds on vital supplies.

The Health Secretary announced new rules to end the scandal of hospitals paying massively different prices for hundreds of everyday products because they purchase them separately.

A central procurement list will allow the NHS to use its buying power to drive down the costs, with all trusts paying the same for goods. It will save taxpayers up to £500million over the next two years, said Mr Hunt.

At present, hospitals negotiate prices individually and so cannot get the best deals. The NHS spends £25million on sterile surgeons’ gloves, with one brand the dominant market leader.

But if trusts moved to an alternative brand, they could save up to 38 per cent on the current prices, said the Department of Health.

A Government-appointed ‘procurement tsar’ will produce the NHS core list to drive out variation and secure lower prices from suppliers.

‘Difficult decisions’ in other areas meant the Government could protect the health budget, which will rise £12.7billion in this parliament, said a source. But the NHS had to ‘raise its game to meet the challenge of an ageing society’.
