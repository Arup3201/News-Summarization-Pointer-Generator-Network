The daughter of the judge who jailed police killer Harry Roberts for life said her father would have sentenced him to death had the penalty not been abolished only a year before.

Roberts, 78, was sentenced to life in prison for killing three policemen in 1966 as he sat in a van preparing for an armed robbery. 

But the pensioner is due to be released next week after his case was reviewed by the Parole Board. He has spent 48 years behind bars.

At the time of his sentencing Mr Justice Hildreth Glyn-Jones told Roberts 'I think it likely that no Home Secretary regarding the enormity of your crime will ever think it fit to show you mercy by releasing you on licence.'

His daughter, Anne Glyn-Jones, 91, said her father thought Roberts was a 'very evil man,' the Sunday Mirror reported. 

She added: 'If the death penalty had been in force he would have given it to them with no reservation.'

Roberts was found guilty of three murders after a trial, in what the judge described as 'the most heinous crime for a generation or more.'

He had been sitting with his accomplices  John Duddy and John Witney in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London.

A £1,000 reward was offered for information leading to the capture of Harry Roberts while he was on the run

The trio had been preparing for an armed robbery when they were approached by the officers and Roberts opened fire with a Luger pistol on the  three unarmed officers. 

Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, and Constable Geoffrey Fox, 41, were killed in the attack on August 12, 1966.

Roberts shot dead two of the officers and the third was killed by another member of the gang. 

His accomplices were caught but former Roberts, then 30, remained on the run for 96 days relying on his training as a soldier to survive. His disappearance sparked Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt.

Roberts was found near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches. Pictured is a tent he lived in in Epping Forest, using the survival skills he learned as a soldier

Roberts was given three life sentences with a 30 year minimum tariff. 

In 2001 Roberts was working on day release from prison at an animal sanctuary where he threatened to kill Joan Cartwright and her husband after she complained about his behaviour. 

He rang her from prison up to five times a week after learning she had given evidence against him and there were several attacks on her animals at the East Midlands sanctuary.

One of his accomplices then shot Geoffrey Fox 

Roberts went on the run for three months and when he was caught he was sentenced to life in prison

His two accomplices are now both dead  

Following the threats Roberts lost his bid to be granted parole five years ago. 

The Parole Board has now decided that Roberts should be released - a decision the Metropolitan Police Federation as criticised as 'a betrayal of policing' by the justice system. 

London mayor Boris Johnson said the decision was 'sickening.' 

Ms Glyn-Jones said while her father had been unhappy sentencing some defendants to death, he had felt the abolition of the penalty could put police at risk.

She added: 'His view was the police are so much more exposed than anyone else and they put their lives on the line.'

Roberts has been deemed eligible for release by the Parole Board which assesses the cases of prisoners who have been sentenced to life in prison once their minimum tariff - in this case 30 years - has passed. 

For a prisoner to be released they have to be assessed as no longer posing a risk of causing serious harm. 

He is expected to leave Littlehey Prison in Cambridge in the next few days and then go to a bail hostel. It is understood his name is likely to be changed. 

The Parole Board said in a statement: 'We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Harry Roberts.

'The decision to release is a matter for the board, which is independent - arrangements and the date of the release are a matter for the Secretary of State for Justice. We are unable to comment further on the details of this case.'
