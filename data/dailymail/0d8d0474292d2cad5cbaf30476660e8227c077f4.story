Tick tock. Tick tock. In Roy Keane’s world, everything runs on time. A 10.30am press briefing means 10.30am and Keane arrived on the button in the Moyne Suite in the Portmarnock Hotel on Sunday.

Straight-backed, eagle-eye stare in place, arms folded, Keano looked like he was braced for trouble. Maybe he was.

Initially, everything ran smoothly.

Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane spoke to the media in the Portmarnock Hotel on Sunday

It only took a few minutes before the spat involving Keane and Frank Gillespie, in another part of the hotel, was pitched into the mix. Are you prepared to go into it (the incident)? ‘No, I’m not,’ said Keane firmly.

Was it a distraction? ‘No,’ he said, clearly inviting another subject.

In the room the FAI media folk let out a sigh of relief. Keane had kicked for touch, and found it.

Tick tock. Tick tock.

Perhaps lightening up, Keane gave an incisive insight into the performance on Friday, his annoyance at the concession of the goal, and what was needed from the players for the next six games if Ireland are to qualify.

His appreciation of the challenge facing him and Martin O’Neill was flecked with nuggets as Keane plugged Robbie Keane’s abilities over Niall Quinn, and hailed the long-serving striker as ‘as good a professional as I have come across.’

Keane also joked about being able to leave the hotel without any security baggage. ‘We’re not One Direction,’ he said with deadpan wit. He revisited his touchline spat with the referee in Celtic Park on Friday night.

‘I was surprised he came over. That’s our job to try to get instructions on to a player or to appeal a decision. I don’t think there was anything over the top,’ he said.

‘When a referee comes over and there’s a couple of photographs taken as usual it always looks 100 times worse than what it is, but it was no big thing.’

For over half-an-hour everything was calm, cordial and under control. Keane had a wee dig at Jack Grealish’s indecision about declaring for Ireland.

More seriously, he expressed concerns that Everton manager Roberto Martinez may be putting a squeeze on his Ireland players, specifically Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy.

‘It does seem to be that Seamus and James are under lots of pressure — they’re turning up, or they mightn’t turn up, or they’re struggling,’ he said.

And then, Sportsmail asked Keane about all the distractions involving him over the last six months, most recently the hassle with Gillespie.

Tick tock. Tick tock... boom.

Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty

Everton's James McCarthy has missed the Republic of Ireland's last three Euro 2016 qualifiers 

Sportsmail: ‘I’d like your thoughts on this, between the Celtic link, Villa link, book being published, and the incident last week….’

Keane: ‘I’m not giving you any comment. Why would you think I have to give you an opinion on everything? Do you think you’ve a right to sit there and ask me anything you want, and get an answer? I think I’ve been more than fair with you.’

Sportsmail: ‘You have (been fair). But my point is Martin (O’Neill) has been asked about the distractions. Has he had enough of those distractions?

Keane: ‘What are you asking me for? What are you talking about? What distractions? Can I do anything about the Celtic stuff?’

Sportsmail: ‘Yeah, Celtic and Villa.’

Keane: ‘Can I do anything about them things that come up? If I get approached about a job and I’m up front with the manager and the media, do you want me to… how is that a distraction?

‘What can I do about that? You’re making out I’m bringing all these distractions on.’

Keane claimed the media are making out he is bringing distractions to the Republic of Ireland squad

Sportsmail: ‘Just a coincidence?’

Keane: ‘Well, if a club approaches me, these things just happen, yeah. You think the book’s a distraction to a group of professional people? Do me a favour.

‘And then people all writing about the incident the other night, lies….and people have got pals and talking to them.

‘You think I’ve got to justify that to everyone? You all sit there and think I’ve got to answer to everything? Who in the hell do you think you are? I’ve got to answer to you?

‘I answer to the FAI and Martin. And if we don’t get the right results, I’ll be gone and you won’t lose a minute’s sleep, so don’t worry about distractions. The things you write about are distractions.’

Sportsmail: ‘We write about it, but it was an obvious thing to write about. There was an incident.’

Keane: ‘Exactly. But you’re on about Celtic and Aston Villa. What do you want me to do about them? If Celtic approached me, what did you want me to say? You couldn’t get enough of it. So what can I do about the Celtic situation?’

Keane was speaking at a press conference ahead of his team's match against USA on Tuesday

Sportsmail: ‘I don’t know. It was extraordinary that Martin brought it to our attention…’

Keane: ‘What other incident? The book? Do you think the book was a distraction? An agreement was made six months before it was out. Ask Martin. What’s he said?’

Sportsmail: ‘I think he’s had enough of these (distractions)?’

Keane: ‘Go and ask him. Go and see him in the lobby. You’re not brave enough to ask him?’

Sportsmail: ‘I am brave enough to ask him.’

Keane: ‘Go and ask him. You’re asking me what Martin O’Neill might be thinking? Why don’t you ask Martin? What if we qualified? Do you think it will be a distraction? Are you thinking it’s all a distraction from the result the other night?’

Keane accused the media of not being brave enough to ask  manager Martin O'Neill about the 'distractions'

Sportsmail: ‘It was the build-up to the game for 24 hours. Everyone was talking about it.’

Keane: ‘What was the problem?

Sportsmail: ‘We were all talking about it.’

Keane: ‘Talking about what? Talking about something you don’t have a clue about, and everyone writing lies. The usual nonsense.’

Tick tock. Tick tock. For Ireland, the FAI and O’Neill, the ticking continues.
