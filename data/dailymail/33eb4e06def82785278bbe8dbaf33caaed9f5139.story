A man plunged to his death from a Manhattan hotel onto a busy sidewalk Monday afternoon.

Authorities say the man, who has not been named, fell from the ninth floor of the Pod 39 hotel at 145 East 39th St and Lexington Ave around 1:10pm.

Witnesses say the man almost hit a pedestrian as he landed on the sidewalk.

Suspected suicide: Witnesses say a man plunged from the ninth floor of the Pod 39 Hotel

The New York Daily News reports that a hotel employee said the man had been staying at the hotel after losing his apartment on West 33rd Street recently.

The worker also claimed the man had attempted suicide in his room only a day earlier.

'He tried to commit suicide last night,' the hotel employee said. 'We sent him to the hospital but they let him out.'

A delivery man, Chris Erario, told the New York Post that he heard the man land.

'I was loading up packages for one of the buildings with my back against the whole scene. All I heard was the sound of the guy hitting the pavement,' said Erario, 43, of Queens. 'Thatâ€™s not something you ever want to hear.'

'A guy almost got hit by the body falling,' Erario said of the man. 'This guy had to jump out of the way from the falling body.'

According to Gothamist, the Hispanic male was pronounced dead on arrival 'with injuries consistent to a fall from a high point.'

A witness told Gothamist that it took abnormally long for authorities to arrive and cover the body.

Police do not believe at this point that there are any suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

Pod Hotels have small rooms and are designed for travelers on a budget.
