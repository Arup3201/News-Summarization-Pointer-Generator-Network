It has been with Jack Hepworth almost all his married life and he freely admits it’s the second love of his life.

So the retired draughtsman has been left heartbroken after thieves stole his treasured Morris Minor.

Mr Hepworth, 85, has clocked up almost 300,000 miles in the grey Morris 1000 since paying £180 for it second hand in 1968.

The car, which he affectionately calls Maurice, was stolen from the garage of his home, in Levenshulme, Manchester, while Mr Hepworth was visiting his wife of 53 years, Marion, 80, in hospital.

She is seriously ill with pneumonia and is still unaware of the theft, which happened at around 11am on December 21.

Mr Hepworth said: ‘Obviously as long 
as Marion gets better and comes home that is all that matters – but I 
have to say losing Maurice is almost like losing part of the family.

‘It’s just surprising how you get 
attached to things and I do miss Maurice dearly. Our only child was 
stillborn so you could say the car was like the baby we never had, we’ve
had it that long.

‘I haven’t told Marion about the 
theft because it will upset her that much, and given she is very ill, it
would break her heart if she knew.’

The car – registration number XBU 911 – was built in 1961 and has been all over the UK with the couple. 

‘It is the only car I have ever had,’ Mr Hepworth added. ‘It’s seen a lot. We used to go holidaying all over the UK in it.

The alleged thief is white, 6ft tall, between 25 and 35 years old with collar-length ‘mousey’ hair.

The vehicle has not been seen since 
the broad daylight theft at 11am on December 21 and now Jack has to pay 
£20 a time for round trips to hospital by taxi including having to pay 
for extra fares over Christmas and the New Year bank holidays.

Today, as police hunted the thieves 
and the car, Mr Hepworth, who never had any children with Marion, opened
his family photo album to show precious pictures of the couple's days 
out in the car dating back over the decades.

Mr Hepworth said: 'All the kiddies on the street loved 
it and one time we had eight of them sat in it outside our home.

'I'm just appealing for it to be 
returned or if anyone has seen it to come forward. I’d be so glad if I 
could get the car back.'

He recalled: 'I was a motorcyclist 
but I got fed up of getting knocked off of my bike.

'We bought the car 
second hand as we had just got the house and money was tight. I thought 
that I would only have Maurice for two years - yet it is the only car I 
have ever had.

'It's been to Scotland, Wales, East Anglia, everywhere. We 
used to go holidaying all over the UK in it.

'For my 80th birthday I even had a 
cake with a picture of me stood in front of the car printed on it. 
Everyone knew me for the car. When I first got it I was so proud of it -
I still am still.

'The outside is very good condition and I rarely needed to wash and polish it because it did shine as if it was brand new.

'The beauty was the battery as it was
guaranteed for life so as long as I own the car I have got a battery 
for life, I’ve had seven so far. I used to drive it every day, whether 
it be to take Marion shopping or to have her hair done, it’s been a 
tough reliable car.'

The theft took place five days after 
Marion was admitted to hospital. He added: 'I had parked it up inside 
the garage and had got a lift to the hospital with Marion’s sister and 
it was taken in broad daylight.

'It had been parked there for safety 
and that’s where it had always been and yet they broke down my garage 
door to get to it. It’s callous. I always put the burglary alarm on and a
lock on it so I didn’t expect to have it stolen.

'Yet they forced the lock off, opened
the bonnet and hot wired it. I had seen a gang of kids hanging about 
the back before but we have no idea who has done this.

'When I got back a neighbour said 
that the garage had been broken in to and the car was gone, I felt 
rotten. It’s costing me £10 in taxi fares to get to the hospital and £10
back and I'm going to see Marian every day so that is quite a bit of 
money.

'I can't even hire another Morris as 
I’m over 70 and I don’t want to buy another just in case it is returned.
I haven't been sleeping well and I've been getting up at 3 and 4am as I
have so much on my mind and it has got me all worked up.

'The car was very well known around 
the area as no one else has one around here. Everyone used to wave at us
when we drove it and it brought such a smile to people's faces.

'People who have heard what has 
happened has said what a shame it is. It is such a distinctive car and 
because it was one of a kind it is more noticeable than ever.

'People have wanted to buy it from me
but I couldn’t bear to part with Maurice. It has brought us a lot of 
joy over the years and I just dearly want it back.'

Greater Manchester Police said a man 
described as white, about 6ft tall, between 25 and 35 years old with 
collar-length 'mousey' hair was seen driving a vehicle of similar 
description away from the scene.

PC Lisa Valentine said: 'The car is 
this man’s pride and joy and is the biggest love in his life after his 
wife. He has looked after the car with dedication and purpose for more 
than 40 years and it is more than a mode of transport for him.

'Sadly, the theft has added to what 
is already a very worrying time and he now has the added expense and 
stress of having to get a taxi everyday to visit his wife - who is 
unwell in hospital - instead of simply being able to drive over and see 
her.

'I would dearly love to reunite this car with the victim.'
