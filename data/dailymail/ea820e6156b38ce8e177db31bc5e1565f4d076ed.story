Carlo Ancelotti believes that his current Real Madrid side are better than last season's Champions League winners.

Los Blancos boss Ancelotti is quoted by AS as saying, 'The team is better than last year', ahead of their trip to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday evening.

Barcelona, the other Spanish powerhouse, dominate proceedings on the front page of Mundo Deportivo, leading on the stat that Lionel Messi is now just two goals away from equalling 'Pichichi' Zarra's all-time goalscoring record.

Barca beat nine-man Rayo Vallecano with ease on Saturday evening, a quick-fire double from Messi and Neymar ensuring the three points

Luis Enrique's side now face Eibar next weekend, before travelling to the Bernabeu the week after. If Messi does not score twice in their next match, he could reach Zarra's record at Madrid.

Italian paper Corriere dello Sport are fully focused on Sunday's night big match - Juventus v Roma.

The paper describe the match as, 'The best of Italy', citing the two side's perfect record at the beginning of the Serie A season.

Both have played five and won five, and both managers are positive about their chances in the match. Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri says, 'It's tough to beat us here', while Roma boss Rudi Garcia claims, quite simply, 'We can win'.

The Italian papers are also split - La Gazzetta Sportiva on Milan's win, and Corriere Dello Sport on Juventus vs Roma - Sunday night's big match

The stadium is sold out, Andrea Pirlo will be on the bench, and Corriere label Totti vs Tevez as the clash to watch out for. 

La Gazzetta Sportiva focus on AC Milan's win over Chievo on Saturday evening. Filippo Inzaghi's side got back to winning ways with goals from Keisuke Honda and Sulley Muntari, and Gazzetta's main spread includes a picture of the Japanese international celebrating his goal.

Honda's free-kick, the paper claim, is among the best of the season, while Inzaghi's change of system proved decisive.

They continue by saying that Stephan El Shaarawy is back, while Fernando Torres had a performance to forget for his new side.
