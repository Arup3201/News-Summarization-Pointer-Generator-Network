A spooky, high-pitched whining sound coming from One World Trade Center has been giving New York residents the creeps.

The strange choral sound, which appears to be caused by the wind, was first reported last year at around the time of Hurricane Sandy and has been heard several times since.

It has now been recorded by New Yorker Kenny Cummings who described it as 'unmistakable and very chilling'.

Ghostly sound:  A high, pitched whining sound has been recorded coming from One World Trade Center

He told the Tribeca Citizen: 'I live a couple of blocks from the 
tower, and first heard this very eerie sound during Hurricane Sandy last
 year.

'I’ve heard it only once afterwards, sometime last 
winter. I assumed once the building’s framework and windows went in, the
 airflow would be redirected.

'At 3.15am Wednesday, I awoke to
 the sound. It was slightly different in timbre, with two tones this 
time. 

'I couldn’t be sure what it was at first, but after a moment I 
realized it was the Trade Center…I’m sure all of downtown hears 
this—it’s unmistakable and very chilling.'

Other readers have posted theories as to what is causing the noise with one suggesting it the wind whipping through numbers One and Seven World Trade Center.

Another wrote: 'I heard it last Wednesday as well – could barely sleep as the screaming kept waking me up. It was so eerie. I didn’t make the connection you did though, and sadly makes sense.'
