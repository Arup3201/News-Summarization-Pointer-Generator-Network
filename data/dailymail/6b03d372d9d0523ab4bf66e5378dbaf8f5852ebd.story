A new instant tanning spray promoted with images of a naked Kate Moss lounging beside a pool is being secretly withdrawn because of safety fears.

The company behind cans of St Tropez Instant Tan Wash Off Face & Body Spray has issued a confidential safety recall to high street and online stores.

The problem is related to reports of breathing problems among women customers who accidentally inhaled the spray when using it.

The product was launched only weeks ago, while it featured at London Fashion Week where it was used in catwalk shows by the likes of Cara Delevingne.

However, a leaked warning from the Global Executive Director of the British brand, Jessica Finch, says spray can versions of the product should be withdrawn from sale with immediate effect.

The memo reads: ‘The objective of this communication is to implement a withdrawal of product from retailer warehouse and shelves and to cease selling online.’

It adds: ‘We have recently been made aware of a small number of isolated adverse reactions to the newly launched St Tropez Instant Tan Wash Off Face & Body Spray (100ml) in light/medium and medium/dark.

‘As a result, we have decided to withdraw the product from our customers’ warehouses and on-shelves with immediate effect.

‘We are currently reviewing the composition of the product and conducting a full risk assessment. 

'As a precautionary measure, please also remove these two products from online sales.’

The
 problem with the product is not spelt out in the warning to retailers, 
however a clue is offered in a hard-to-find safety recall notice on the 
firm’s website.

This states: ‘We have recently been 
made aware that a very small number of customers have experienced 
inhalation issues with the newly launched cosmetic product, St.Tropez 
Instant Tan Wash Off Face & Body Spray… when used under certain 
circumstances.’

It advises customers to return it to their retailer to claim a full refund of the £10 purchase price.

The recall is highly damaging to the British brand, which is owned by PZ Cussons and a fortune was spent on launching the instant tanning range in September.

Kate Moss was central to the launch with photo-shoots and a video on the St Tropez website heralding the new instant tanning product.

Speaking on behalf of the company, the 39-year-old, said: ‘St Tropez is a trustworthy brand and people know it.

'It's a natural looking tan. That’s what people want, they don't want something orange and it is really easy to apply yourself.

‘When I've got a tan, it definitely helps with confidence.’

She added: ‘St Tropez do it so well now.
 They do look natural you don't have to fear that they go streaky and 
not being able to get it off.’

The problem with the product appears limited to the spray can version, rather than the lotion form of the product which is just rubbed into the skin.

When launching the product, the company boasted that the formula contains RAINMAC technology with silicon-coated pigments, which prevents them from streaking or running. It said this formula ensures that the colour does not run or rub off.

Barry Mulcahy, of Recall UK, said the law around product safety withdrawals is a grey area.

Currently, regulations state that firms must do ‘everything practical’ to alert consumers, however there is no official guidance as to what this means in practice.

Often, companies run advertisements in newspapers - but that has not happened  with the St Tropez product.

St Tropez said it has asked retailers to alert customers by putting up posters in stores.

Michelle Feeney, the chief executive of PZ Cussons Beauty, said: ‘St Tropez has recently been made aware that a very small number of our customers have  experienced inhalation issues.

‘When concerns are raised about any of our products, we adopt a responsible and proactive approach. Any customers who have purchased the product can return it to their point of purchase for a full refund.’

She stressed that other products in the range are not affected and apologised to customers for any inconvenience.
