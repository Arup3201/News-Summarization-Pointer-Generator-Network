An ambitious mother who has one son and one daughter with albinism says she is certain both of them will be stars, and is encouraging them to believe they can do anything to which they set their minds.

Lisa Needham, 43, and her husband Jim, 50, from Wolverhampton, both have the recessive gene for albinism, and of their three children - Matthew, 14, Jessica, 11, and Ben, seven - the youngest two are albino.

But despite being devastated when they first discovered their children were affected by the genetic disorder which affects the skin, hair and eyes, the proud parents now feel that it's good to be different, and make sure they let their children know it frequently.

In fact, both youngsters have begun to excel when it comes to sport and amateur dramatics, with Jessica eyeing up the stage and Ben keen to one day find himself in the Paralympic swimming pool.

After Jessica was born, her parents decided to have another child, thinking that since they already had one daughter with albinism it might be nice for her to have a sibling with it as well

Lisa said: 'You go straight from thinking you have a child with nothing wrong who is going to run the country or play for Man United and then you discover there is a problem.

'You then start to think they're not going to go to school, have friends, get married, and will look and behave differently.

'But you soon realise that they can lead the way and will almost certainly achieve everything they set out to do.'

Lisa and Jim are now confident they have prepared their son and daughter for their lives ahead.

Their resolve to act was strengthened when they saw the TV documentary The Undateables, which featured an albino case study who could not find love.

Despite being devastated when they first discovered their children were affected by the genetic disorder which affects the skin, hair and eyes, Lisa and Jim now feel it's good to be different

But it has been a difficult road and Lisa admits she was worried about how they would cope.

They had no known relatives with the condition and were shocked when doctors gave them the news four weeks after Jessica left hospital.

They already had an older son, Matthew, 14, who was born without albinism and had no indication they both carried the recessive gene.

They later learned that Ben and Jess both have inherited oculo-cutaneous albinism which affects the hair, skin and eyes.

It means Jessica has very poor eye-sight - especially in strong light - and must wear factor-50 sunscreen in sunny weather.

But the bubbly youngster has surprised everyone with her determined attitude to achieve in running, climbing and horse riding.

She also has ambitions to enjoy a career on stage and earlier this year performed with her school at the Royal Albert Hall.

Jessica, who has just started secondary school, said: 'It was quite awkward at first to make friends at school because everyone was asking about my eyes and why I was so pale. But I told them why and they understood.

'Most of the hobbies I have are the same as everyone else's. I don't try to be different and I try to do everything I am capable of doing.

'I think my best skills are being up on stage and singing in front of people. When I'm up on stage I don't get stage-fright because I can't really see the crowd so don't get nervous.

'My mum and dad used to take me to the pantomime and I used to always wish I could be up there acting so since I started my stage school I have just tried to push myself forward instead of standing back and go for a singing part even if I doubt whether I should or not.

'Being a singer has been my dream all my life and I want to make it happen. So what I need to do is keep pushing myself forward and don't stand back from anything that could get in the way.'

After seeing her flourish, Lisa and Jim decided to have another child, despite the possibility of the baby also having albinism.

They said albinism was already a big part of their lives and 'having another child with the same condition could only be a good thing'.

Albinism is becoming more and more rare and the chances of a random couple having a child with albinism is one in 17,000.

But confirmed carriers of the recessive gene will then have a one in four chance with future children.

Jim recalls the nurses reaction to Ben's 'shocking, white hair' when he was born by caersarian - even though he had asked the medics not to mention anything to Lisa.

He said: 'I just held Lisa's hand and said 'it will be OK'.'

They took exactly the same approach with Ben, who is a keen swimmer with Paralympic aspirations.

And the witty youngster has also have developed a close circle of friends and a close bond with their 'protective', older brother Matthew, 14, who was born without albinism and runs for the county.

However, Lisa and Jim's main worries are yet to come as Jessica gets older and approaches her teenage years and become more self-conscious.

Lisa said: 'My biggest fear of having a little girl with albinism was her looking different. I remember thinking to myself I can cope with her being blind but I couldn't cope with her looking different and people laughing or make fun. But Jess in fact has grown up not looking different to everyone else, but positively more beautiful. The comments we often get are 'look at her beautiful hair'.

However, Jess was a bit unhappy on their family holiday to Majorca two years ago when she had to wear a full UV swim suit to protect her skin at any time before 5pm.

Lisa added: 'They will definitely become more self-aware the older they get but I had tried to assure them that it is quite good being different.

'It can get you further on in life because you will be noticed more. I tell them: 'If you want it, it is out there so push yourself further'.

'Being different is all part of that, so hopefully they have the grounding to use what they have got and take it forward.'

Albinism affects production of melanin, the pigment that colours skin, hair and eye, according to the NHS.

People with albinism have a reduced amount of melanin or no melanin at all. Depending on the amount of melanin a person has, they may have very pale hair, skin and eyes, but some may have brown or ginger hair and skin that can tan.

People with albinism usually have a number of eye conditions such as:

What causes albinism?

Albinism is caused by a lack of the pigment melanin, which usually gives hair, skin and eyes their colour.

In albinism, cells that produce melanin do not work because of genetic mutations (faulty genes). Different genes are responsible for the different types of albinism.

Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is the most common type of albinism. Several different genes have been identified that may cause OCA.Diagnosing albinismAlbinism is usually obvious when a baby is born.

As albinism can cause a number of eye conditions, your baby’s eyes will need to be examined to see how they are affected. They may be referred to an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in diagnosing and treating eye conditions) for these tests.Treating albinismAlbinism itself does not need treatment, but the associated skin and eye problems it can cause do.

A child with albinism will need regular eye tests and it is likely they will need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems such as short-sightedness, long-sightedness and astigmatism. 

A person with albinism will need to take extra care in the sun. Without melanin in their skin, ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight can easily damage their skin (sunburn).OutlookAlbinism does not get worse and the condition does not alter a person's life expectancy. However, people with albinism have an increased risk of developing skin cancer.

Babies with albinism often appear to have severe vision impairment, but their vision rapidly improves during the first six months. However, vision does not reach normal levels and the child will need extra support at school. They will otherwise do well in normal schooling.

Albinism does not affect a child’s intelligence, but may affect their social development. For example, if they are bullied because they look different, they may find it difficult to make friends and play with other children in a group.

This may be partly due to a tendency to invade other children's personal space by getting very close to see. They may also need help finding their friends across a crowded playground.

Young children with albinism may also appear clumsy because their reduced vision can affect their ability to learn certain actions and movements, such as picking up an object or learning how to crawl. As the child develops, and with aids to help their vision, this should improve.
