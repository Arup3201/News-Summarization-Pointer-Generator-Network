A Pennsylvania prosecutor says two boys charged with the murder of a 21-year-old woman boasted about wanting to rob and kill someone for several weeks and thought they were 'some kind of gangstas'.

Ryan Hardwick, 15, and Deauntay Dontaz Moye, 16, allegedly orchestrated the 'senseless' killing of Stephanie Waters, of Roaring Spring, last week and have now been charged as adults.

Waters went missing on January 8, but police found her body two days later on the backseat of her car near an abandoned house in Woodbury.

She was lying alongside her dog. Both had been shot dead.

Murdered: The pair did not know they were meeting Stephanie Waters (pictured), expecting her boyfriend, however went ahead with their planned killing anyway, prosecutors say

According to The Wellsboro Gazette, Moye and Hardwick believed they were buying marijuana off Waters' boyfriend, however she arrived at the location instead.

Moye got into Waters' car and sat in the passenger seat, while Hardwick sat in the back with her dog.

They drove a short distance and parked, which is when Moye produced a revolver, police say.

He then shot Waters in the neck.

Seconds later Moye shot her in the head.

One of the teens then killed the dog, but it is unclear which.

The pair then allegedly moved Waters' body into the back seat and drove her Mazda around smoking weed.

Charged: Moye (right) faces charges that include criminal homicide, robbery and aggravated assault, while Hardwick faces charges including conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, robbery, and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault

They parked the car at Moye's house and stayed there the night.

The next day, Hardwick dumped the car at the location it was found.

He then hid the gun and car keys in his closet, where they recovered by police.

'To think that a 21-year old girl – with a full life ahead of her – was senselessly murdered over some weed is just heartbreaking,' District Attorney Bill Higgins, Jr. said.

'The next time someone tells you that marijuana is a harmless drug ...  think of the family of this young lady – 21 year-old Stephanie Waters. 

'Now even more young lives will be wasted away behind prison bars. 

'Marijuana is a harmless drug? Not to these families.' 

Murder plans: During the the investigation, police determined Hardwick and Moye had discussed robbing someone for marijuana for weeks. Moye had also been talking about shooting someone for several weeks

Higgins said the pair set up the drug deal to fulfill their desire to rob and kill.

'These two men wanted to live the ''gangsta lifestyle'',' he said.

'They talked tough and acted tough, and now, they can be tough from the inside of a prison for as long as I can possibly keep them there.' 

Moye is charged with homicide, robbery and other offenses. 

Hardwick is charged with conspiracy to commit homicide and other offenses.
