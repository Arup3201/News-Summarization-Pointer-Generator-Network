A schoolgirl was horrified when she found a dirty grey feather in a ham, cheese and pickle sandwich she was eating for breakfast.

Tanika Nadarajah was on her way to school in Tooting, south east London, when she and her mother stopped to buy breakfast from a local Tesco. 

The seven-year-old chose her favourite £2.30 sandwich of ham, cheese and pickle, but was horrified when she saw the soggy feather lying beneath the slice of bread.

Tanika had to take the following day off school after breaking out in a rash and was forced to see a doctor, claimed her family. 

Her uncle, Sammy Menan, said he wanted to know what the supermarket was going to do to remedy the mistake. 

'It is not the cost, I want to know why and what they are going to do about it,' said Mr Menan. 

'She has scratch marks on her face from itching. She felt like vomiting when it happened. 

'It's her favourite sandwich - she eats it every day.' 

Tanika, (left), who eats the own brand sandwiches every day, came out in a rash after biting into the feather and had to go to the doctors. Tesco said it was investigating the issue

The schoolgirl and her mother said the experience had made them stop wanting to shop at the Tesco Express on Mitcham Road in Tooting 

The family often picks breakfast up en route to the child's school in Tooting, and normally choose croissants or sandwiches for their first meal of the day. 

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We are concerned to hear about this and are fully investigating the issue.'
