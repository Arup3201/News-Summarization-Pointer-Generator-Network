Tesco has ousted Asda as Britain’s cheapest supermarket for Christmas among the big five retailers.

A survey of the price of 33 ‘essential’ seasonal products – from turkeys to satsumas – by trade magazine The Grocer found that Tesco’s basket cost £135.80 – 41p cheaper than Asda.

There was little to choose between all the supermarkets, with Morrisons adding up to £136.93, Sainsbury’s on £145.14 and Waitrose at £147.55.

Battle: For the first time in six years, Tesco is the place to do your Christmas shop, not long-time winner Asda

Competition: Asda blasted the survey's findings, which put a Tesco shop at 41p cheaper than its rival

Asda has been cheapest in the survey for the past four years.

A statement released by The Grocer said: 'Tesco has won the Christmas Grocer 33 for the first time ever -- stunning rival Asda, winner for the past four years.'

Asda, which markets a guarantee to be 10 per cent cheaper than its rivals, has won the ‘Christmas 33’ in five of the six years since The Grocer launched the festive version of its weekly price comparison table.

But this year the the survey found Tesco's checkout bill was 41p lower than Asda with mark-downs on Champagne, red wine, streaky bacon and Christmas pudding.

David Wood, Tesco’s UK marketing director, said: 'The team at Tesco are delighted to have won this year’s Christmas Grocer 33 basket.

Budget: The Grocer found shoppers can get a good deal on pudding and bacon for pigs in blankets this year

Drink: Tipples including red wine and Champagne are also cheaper at Tesco than Asda this Christmas

'Winning the Grocer 33 shows how hard we’re working to keep prices low on the products that matter most at Christmas.'

But Asda labelled Tesco’s victory as 'hollow'.

Stephen Smith, Asda’s chief marketing officer, said: 'It’s a hollow victory for them to win by just 41p, when we do the right thing by holding down the cost of living week in, week out. Yes, we are disappointed, but we are in the long game.'

Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer, said: 'It’s only the second time in 12 months that Tesco has won our weekly shopping basket price analysis competition, but the Christmas 33 is a particularly iconic basket because it’s so important to shoppers that a supermarket offers value over the Festive season.

'The fact that the difference between the cheapest - Tesco - and the most expensive - Waitrose - was less than 10 per cent shows how intense the fight in the grocery space is.'
