Mario Balotelli has wasted no time in endearing himself to Liverpool fans, by posting a picture of himself as all four members of The Beatles. 

The Italian striker took to Instagram to share the picture of his head replacing those of four of Liverpool's favourite sons. 

New signing Balotelli has always been known to enjoy himself off the pitch, and he shared the cheeky picture with the caption, 'we were five!!!'.

Liverpool's new signing had already amused supporters when he struggled to put a bib on in Wednesday's training session, after famously suffering the same misfortune while at Manchester City.

Balotelli will likely get the chance to show off his prowess on the field on Sunday, when he is in line to make his debut against table-topping Tottenham.

Reds manager Brendan Rodgers told the club's official website that he expects Balotelli to play at White Hart Lane.

'I think by the weekend [he'll be ready to feature],' he said.

'He's been into pre-season and he's played three 45-minute games. He might not be up to full match speed, but he's looking fit.

'We've done some analysis on him. The medical and sports science team have worked with him already and he's in very, very good condition.

'He's in to work and he'll be available for the squad for the weekend.'
