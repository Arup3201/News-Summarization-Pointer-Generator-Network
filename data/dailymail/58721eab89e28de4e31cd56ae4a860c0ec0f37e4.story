James Rodriguez has undoubtedly been the start of the World Cup so far.

Whilst he was far from an unknown before the tournament began in Brazil, for a Â£38.5millon footballer, he did exist with an impressive amount of anonymity.

But his sensational performances have changed all that, as he's helped fire Colombia to the quarter-finals with five goals that currently put him top of the goalscoring charts - ahead of the likes of Lionel Messi, Thomas Muller and Neymar.

Unaware: Pablo Armero enters the room...

Frightener: Before the trio of Colombians jump out to scare him

Brazil await in the last-eight on Friday, but Rodriguez and his team-mates are still managing to chill out and have fun ahead of the crunch clash, even finding the time to play pranks on Pablo Armero in their hotel room.

The 22-year-old, with Juan Cuadrado and Carlos Bacca, announce on a vine that 'we're going to scare (little Armero)', before jumping out on him from behind the curtain and frightening the life out of him.

The South American side, who are playing in their first World cup for 16 years, have set the tournament alight, and if they can stay this relaxed, then they may have a real chance of going all the way.
