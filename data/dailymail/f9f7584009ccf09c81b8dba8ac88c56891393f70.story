A mother whose two-year-old son died after she left him in a boiling hot car for 12 hours has been jailed for 35 years.

Mollie Shouse, 29, left the boy in temperatures of up to 150F (66C) while she passed out at her apartment in Louisville, U.S., after taking drugs. 

She showed remorse only for herself and had to take responsibility for the death of her son Kenton Brown, a judge said yesterday.

'No remorse': Mollie Shouse was told to 'take responsibility' for allowing her son to die as the judge sentenced her yesterday

Shouse was convicted of murder last month by a Jefferson County jury, who recommended the sentence that was imposed yesterday.

The 29-year-old will be eligible for parole in 20 years.

Jefferson Circuit Judge Olu Stevens said Shouse had lied repeatedly to the police about what had happened when her son died on May 21, 2011.

'You have to take responsibility for this,' he said. 'You are responsible for this life that 
is no more. I didn’t see anywhere… where you showed remorse for what 
your child went through, what he suffered at your hands.'

Shouse showed little emotion at her 
sentencing and did not speak on her own behalf, according to the Courier Journal. Afterwards, she looked 
back in the courtroom at her family, who had pleaded for leniency.

Prosecutor Erin McKenzie said the sentence was not unduly harsh, because Kenton, strapped in his car seat, 'suffered for hours upon hours while his skin seared against the hot plastic of the buckle between his legs.'

The sentence is believed to be one of the longest in the country for a child left in a vehicle, according to American organisation KidsAndCars.org.

There have been several other local cases in 
which children were left in hot vehicles and died, in which the courts 
were far more lenient with those responsible.

A man whose eight-month-old son died after he accidentally left him in a hot car in June was not even indicted by a Jefferson County grand jury.

But prosecutors said Shouse’s case was different because she knew she was risking her child's life and decided to ignore the danger.

'This was a deliberate decision on her part,' said Ms McKenzie after the sentencing.

'She chose to get high and it was convenient for her to leave him in the car to do so. The car seat was a babysitter for her.'
