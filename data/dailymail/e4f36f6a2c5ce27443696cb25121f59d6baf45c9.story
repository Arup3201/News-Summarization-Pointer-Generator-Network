A man has been arrested after a shoot-out with police following a siege in which he took his pregnant girlfriend hostage, as well as their four-month-old son.

Four NYPD officers were wounded by Nakwon Foxworth after they intervened in an argument he was having over access to the corridors of his apartment building early on Sunday morning.

Two officers were hit in the leg and the others were grazed by the suspect's bullets after he barricaded himself in the building.

They were taken to hospital  after the attack in  Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn and all were expected to recover from their injuries.

Shooter: Nakwon Foxworth, 33, is accused of taking his pregnant girlfriend Jessica Hickling, right, and their 4-month-old son hostage during a shootout with police early on Sunday morning

According to witnesses at the scene, Foxworth, 33, was arriving back to his apartment about 10.30pm 
on Saturday night with his pregnant girlfriend, identified as Jessica 
Hickling, and their four-month-old son when the 
trouble started.

Angry with movers whose barrel was 
blocking the service entrance, Foxworth allegedly started to argue with 
the movers before turning physical with them, according to the movers.

'He took the stroller, with the baby in it, and started ramming it into the 
barrel,' mover Kairon Decaul, 43, told the Daily News.

'He became very angry. The woman started screaming, "The baby! The 
baby!",' Mr Decaul recalled.

Foxworth then pulled out a gun, according to the man, chasing one of the two out to his truck.

'He 
came back inside and threw the gun in the baby's stroller. He put his finger in 
my face and threatened me. The girl was screaming, "Calm down! calm 
down!" Mr Decaul said.

Survivors: Detective Michael Keenan (left) and 
Officer Matthew Granahan attended the scene where a man was holding his 
pregnant girlfriend and baby hostage

Fleeing
 to their sixth floor apartment, Foxworth barricaded himself, his 
girlfriend and their child inside while the outside mover called police.

Ms Hickling surprised NYPD officers outside the apartment's door
 when she dashed out two hours later carrying her son in her arms.

'When she just left and left the door open, he started shooting,' Commissioner Ray Kelly said.

According to Mr Kelly, the close quarters had 'the 
assailant and the officers no more than 10 feet apart.'

On watch: The four NYPD officers were expected to make a full recovery after being shot in the early hours of Sunday morning

The injured officers were named as 
Captain Al Pizzano, Detective Kenneth Ayala, Detective Mike Keenan and 
Police Officer Matthew Granahan.

After shooting 12 times, Foxworth was struck in the stomach. He was taken to King's County Hospital 
and was in a stable but critical condition.Â 

A search of the apartment found that Foxworth, who has served time for attempted murder, robbery and selling drugs, had several illegal guns and ammunition at the apartment.

New York Mayor Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly visited the injured men in hospital this morning.

Mr Bloomberg said: 'We just visited 
members of the Department who were injured in a shooting this morning 
that we wanted to brief you on: Captain Al Pizzano, Detective Kenneth 
Ayala, Detective Mike Keenan and Police Officer Matthew Granahan.

'Fortunately, all are in stable condition and are expected to fully 
recover.

'We have now had eight - that's 
correct, eight - members of the department shot in the last four months.
 And this is the second time in the last 24 hours police have been fired
 upon by armed assailants.

Shoot out: Four police officers were injured during the exchange of fire in Brooklyn, New York

'All
 the shootings have a disgraceful fact in common: all were committed 
with illegal guns that came from out of state. And that is the case with
 nearly every shooting in our city.

'We
 got very lucky tonight, with no life-threatening injuries to officers 
or innocent bystanders. But sometimes, as you remember, we aren't so 
lucky, as we saw with the murder of Police Officer Peter Figoski in 
December.'

Detective Keenan, 52, is a 28-year veteran of the NYPD and Detective Ayala, 49, has served for 18 years. Mr Granahan, 35, has worked for the NYPD for 11 years and Mr Pizzano, 45, is a 25-year veteran.
