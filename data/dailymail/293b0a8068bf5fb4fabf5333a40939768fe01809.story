The Humane Society of the United States claims a months-long undercover investigation of two roadside zoo's has found shocking abuse and neglect of exotic animals kept for profit.

The Humane Society revealed their findings on Thursday which focus on what they call the persistent mistreatment of four tiger cubs and neglect that led to the death of a 24-year-old giraffe after she had given birth to twins.

The HSUS conducted the investigations at Tiger Safari in Oklahoma and Natural Bridge Zoo in Virginia and found that cubs were punched and hit from three-weeks old to condition them for paying customers to have their photographs taken with them.

Sad death for elegant giant: According to the Humane Society of the United States this 24-year-old giraffe passed away a year after giving birth to twins - which the animal apparently never recovered from

Exotic animals in captivity: The giraffe's death was just one example of cruelty alleged at the two zoos. Another witnessed was a spider monkey with a bone-deep hand wound - that apparently was not treated for weeks

Paying public: The financial incentives for the two roadside zoo's owners are great. They can charge anywhere from $50 to $1,000 for a photo shoot with a tiger cub

The Humane Society investigation also found a critical lack of veterinary care, crowded conditions and filthy cages, among other unsafe conditions.

The undercover Humane Society members embedded themselves as staff at the two facilities and claim they witnessed the deaths of animals through willful mismanagement.

The deaths included a baby camel who accidentally hung herself through neglect, a capuchin monkey who mistakenly ate rat poison and died and saw sick guinea pigs killed by slamming them into the ground.

They also found a spider monkey with a bone-deep hand wound and a lone elephant who is locked away in a dark barn when she isn't giving rides to the public.

Dragged: In footage shot secretly and supplied by the Humane Society a white tiger cub called Maximilian appears to be pulled along the ground against its will

Accused: The Tiger Safari in Oklahoma and the Natural Bridge Zoo in Virginia had employees with the Humane Society secretly join their staff for months last year

Struck: In this clip a woman is heard to call the tiger cub a 'b****' for biting her and then what follows appears to be a slap

Discipline: Another white tiger cub is hit on the nose while inside a small cage by one of his handlers

Wayne Pacelle, who is the president and CEO of the HSUS has called for the US Department of Agriculture to revoke both the zoo's licenses and for Virginia and Oklahoma to press cruelty to animal charges.

According to the USHS, both their investigations witnessed how each zoo ran a profitable business out of using their tiger cubs for photo shoots with the public.

The fees charges would vary between $50 to $1,000 per session.

In a written response to the Associated Press, Natural Bridge Zoo owner Karl Mogensen called the allegations 'slanderous' and 'vicious propaganda' aimed at soliciting donations. He also denied the accusations.

Tiger Safari has yet to respond to the allegations.

Footage recorded in secret by the HSUS revealed the tiger cubs squealing in distress during these photo shoots and apparently being hit, punched, slapped and choked as discipline for misbehaving.

The HSUS also alleges that the four cubs were taken away from their mothers just after being born and hand reared instead.

Smiles: This family have a picture taken with an elephant at one of the two facilities: The Humane Society allege that one of the elephants at the two roadside zoos are locked away in a dark room after entertaining the public

Trust: This elephant is charged with giving rides to children around one of the grounds where mistreatment is alleged

The undercover investigation also claims in some instances that Tiger Safari and Natural Bridge Zoo put their cubs up for public handling when they were only three or four weeks old.

Indeed, the HSUS also claims that the public are being exposed to potentially dangerous illnesses through the facilities mishandling of the tigers.

One particular allegation is that a three-week-old tiger cub with ringworm was handled by 27 people after being transported to Tiger Safari in a 19-hour car journey from South Carolina.

Another, white tiger cub called Maximus was seen to be dragged, punched and slapped by his handler at Tiger Safari and on one day forced to do 60 photo sessions with the paying public.

Lurking in the background and a common domininator between both Tiger Safari and Natural Bridge Zoo according to HSUS is a group called T.I.G.E.R.S, which is based in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Tragic: Allegedly one capuchin monkey ate rat poison at one of the two facilities and later died

It is run by a man named Kevin Antle, who is known as a kingpin of the exotic animal trading world according to the USHS.

According to the HSUS, 'Antle gives and takes cubs from both Natural Bridge Zoo and Tiger Safari. We don't know if any money changes hands – it's a secretive business and, unbelievably, these animals are bred indiscriminately all over the country and not tracked by any one agency for their lifetimes.'

Ron Kagan, executive director and CEO of the Detroit Zoological Society told the HSUS: 'It appears that both operations are typical roadside zoos with amateur, reckless and harsh captive conditions and treatment. 

'The physical discipline and examples of deprivation are clear as is the fact that the public is being put at risk by coming into contact with an animal capable of biting, clawing and spreading parasites.'
