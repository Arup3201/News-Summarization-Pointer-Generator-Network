Celebrities Blake Lively and Kristen StewartÂ  have been given an 'ugly makeover' with a hilarious new phone app.

The UglyBooth is designed to give those iPhone users who are insecure about their looks a boost - by showing them how bad things could really be.

Using a photograph, the program rearranges the face to produce less than alluring results.

Make-over gone wrong: Blake Lively pictured before (left) and after (right) the UglyBooth treatment

Ugly: The app has distorted Kristen Stewarts's perfect complexion and delicate button nose beyond recognition

Those with perfect complexion suddenly find they are covered in spots, and dainty features are enlarged while the eyes are brought closer together.

In these hilarious pictures, Gossip Girl star Blake Lively looks a far cry from her usual preened self.

And Tom Cruise certainly wouldn't have landed his beautiful wives Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes if he was really given this 'ugly' transformation.

Celebrities Kayne West, Lindsay Lohan, Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian also look almost unrecognisable in the shots.

New look hunk: Would Eva Mendez have gone for Ryan Gosling if he looked like his UglyBooth equivalent?

Distorted: Lindsay Lohan cares about her looks. She wouldn't want to see this

Spotty: At least Kim Kardashian and Kayne West could comfort each other in their new UglyBooth incarnations

All falls down: Although maybe Kim would be Kayne West's own Runaway with a nose and jaw like this

Uglyfied: Gemma Arterton's model good looks have been completely destroyed by the app

Not so hunky now: Formula 1 hunk Jenson Button looks like a cartoon character after the UglyBooth treatment

And heartthrobs Ryan Gosling and George Clooney would no doubt cringe ifthey caught sight of their 'ugly' selves.

The newly-distorted photo can be sent via text, email, Facebook or Twitter so you can share the makeover with friends - if you dare.

The app, which can also be downloaded on iPod touch and the iPad, comes from PiVi & Co, the makers of the popular FatBooth and AgingBooth.

Released on October 17, it is already proving popular.

They say politics is showbusiness for ugly people: But this makeover of David Cameron takes the biscuit

Eyes too close: Would anyone watch Glee if Lea Michele looked like this?

George Cloney? Silver fox Mr Clooney has been distorted beyond recognition, watch would Stacey Keibler say?

One user, Eric Guzman, said: 'Hilarious. It makes even the best looking celebrities look hideous. LOL great app!'

A PiVi & Co spokesman said: 'The inspiration was to provide an easy to use app that let the user instantly have fun with it.

'We are the team behind AgingBooth and FatBooth.

'And, as with our other booths, simplicity of use and realism of the result were our top priority.'
