They're in the middle of a messy split, she's even had a restraining order taken out on him.

So when Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof's chef Bernie Guzman posted right pictures of the former on his Facebook page looking beaten and bruised, it was hard not to jump to conclusions about her ex, Dr. Paul Nassif.

Battered and bruised: Bernie Guzman posted these pictures of his friend, Adrienne Maloof on Facebook on Monday

Especially when Guzman - who has appeared on several episodes of the Bravo show - strongly insinuated that Paul is responsible for the injuries.

Bernie wrote several messages on his wall as he posted the photos, saying, 'ADRIENNE MALOOF WAS PUSHED TO THE GROUND. PUNCHED & BEATEN ... HE IS A BEAST.'

Bernie continued:  'THIS IS ABOUT SAVING THE LIFE. OF A MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN ... EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THESE PICTURES ... NOW!'

Sore: The welt marks looked fairly recent in the pictures

Tell-tale signs: Marty Singer believes the injuries may be the result of Adrienne's martial arts work-outs

Mystery deepens: This looks set to become one of Hollywood's messiest divorces

Dr. Nassif's lawyer, Marty Singer, told TMZ: 'Any suggestion that the photos show my client struck Adrienne Maloof is a complete fabrication.' 

Singer added: 'No physical assault ever occurred.'

As for how Adrienne suffered the injuries, Singer said: 'I can't speculate how these marks occurred.  I know the woman does martial arts.'

Once so close: The couple in happier times

After being granted temporary custody of their three sons late last month, Maloof successfully obtained a temporary restraining order against her estranged husband.

According to documents acquired by TMZ, Nassif, 50, has been ordered to stay at least 100 feet away from Maloof, their boys, her home and their children's school.

The 50-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star shares sons Gavin, 9, and twins Colin and Christian, 6, with the plastic surgeon.

After ten years of marriage, Maloof and Nassif both filed for divorce in late August.

Maloof's lawyer filed a declaration accusing Nassif of physically abusing their boys.

The Bravo star claimed he allegedly choked one of their boys when they were fighting after school. While the boys were taking a bath later that day, Nassif allegedly spanked one of his sons and 'threw him in the corner.'

The judge subsequently granted Maloof temporary custody of her sons.

Nassif's attorney, Lisa Meyer, denied the allegations and said: 'This smacks of underhandedness. Adrienne wasn't even present when this allegedly occurred.'

Meyer told TMZ: 'It is a sad day when parents have to stoop to the level of making false allegations against another parent.'
