Aitor Karanka slammed Middlesbrough’s ‘worst’ display of the season – despite the victory which got their promotion push back on track.

‘It was one of the worst performances since I came here, I did not recognise some of my players,’ said the Spaniard, whose side responded to Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at home to Leeds to stay within two points of leaders Derby.

‘Four days ago we played very well and lost. Today, we played very badly and won. I prefer this, of course. But we had a lack of ambition. My players normally have personality and character.'

Bolton boss Neil Lennon saw the Trotters lose for the fifth time in their last six outings and was surprised by Karanka’s comments.

‘If that’s the worst they’ve played then they must have played some pretty good stuff earlier in the season,’ he said.

Ghanaian winger Albert Adomah – without a goal since October – fired what proved to be the winner on 34 minutes.

It could have been a far more comprehensive success had Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford not spurned a series of opportunities which came his way.

The first of those arrived when he ballooned over from Adam Reach’s delivery and he had the chance to make amends when Grant Leadbitter sprung him clear soon after. His low poke, however, was flipped over the crossbar by the instinctive arm of Ben Amos.

But the Manchester United goalkeeper – making his first start for the Trotters – was soon beaten. Lee Tomlin was the inspiration with a pass which defined defence-splitting and Adomah did the rest with a cool finish for his fourth of the season.

Bamford, though, was left entering the break wondering just how he hadn’t bagged a first-half hat-trick when he fired over from point-blank range in stoppage-time.

The 21-year-old didn’t fare much better after half-time and swept wide from 12 yards after good work by defender George Friend.

Adomah’s earlier goal, however, ensured Bamford’s blushes were spared.
