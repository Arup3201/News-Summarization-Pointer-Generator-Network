A four-year-old little boy rescued a three-year-old girl from drowning by pushing her up above the water in the deep end of a Fort Worth, Texas, pool on August 6.

But the daring rescue proved to be too much for Xander Vento, who became tired and sunk down to the bottom of the Woodland Springs development pool.

Xander slipped into a coma shortly after being pulled out of the pool and yesterday, his family made the difficult decision to take him off life support. He passed away today.

Tragedy: The daring rescue proved to be too much for Xander Vento, who became tired and sunk down to the bottom of the Woodland Springs development pool

A MedStar spokesman told KHOU that Xander had rushed to help a three-year-old girl who was struggling in the deep end.

Xander supported the girl above the water until she could get to safety, but he slipped under after he became exhausted.

The girl was found to be in fair condition. Paramedics that reached Xander at the bottom of the pool said he lapsed into a coma shortly after.

He was rushed to Cook Children's Medical Center where he was put on life support.

His mother was at the pool during the incident, though it is unclear if there was a lifeguard on duty.

Three days later, his parents Misty and Cris Vento decided to take him off.

'We have made the extremely difficult decision to remove our precious son Xander from life support,' they said in a statement.

'We were blessed to have such a kind and caring boy as Xander, who set an example for all of us and even now he will be saving lives by giving of himself,' they said.

Friends of the Ventos have set up a donation fund to help the family pay for Xander's medical expenses.

Thus far, they have raised $10,000 of $15,000 they hope to donate to the family.

'He is a hero at only four years old!' the donation page reads.

'They have decided to remove him from life support, and let him go be with the Lord. He will continue to be a hero to others.'

Shannon Caldwell, Nicole Richardson Raczy, Kristina Meixner Mugg and the parents various classmates from Keller High School said all of the proceeds will go directly to the Ventos.
