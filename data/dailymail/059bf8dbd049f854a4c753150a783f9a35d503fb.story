Bond girl Berenice Marlohe missed the London Skyfall DVD launch after her plane to the UK was forced to make an emergency landing because of a suspected toxic oil fume leak.

The 33-year-old French actress - who played Severine in the hit film - was on her way to join her Bond co-stars on a specially branded train from London's King's Cross to Edinburgh to promote the UK DVD release of the movie.

But Ms Marlohe and her fellow 265 passengers - including American
Idol host Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend, the singer and actress 
Julianne Hough - were not even one hour into the journey 
from Los Angeles to Heathrow when it was forced to land after 
passengers and crew started to feel unwell.

A Skyfall spokesman said: 'It was a shame Berenice was unable to attend our launch where she was due to unveil the Skyfall train with her fellow Bond actress Naomie Harris.

'Sadly Berenice's plane was grounded in Las Vegas due to fumes in the cabin.'

The captain of the British Airways  Boeing 747 had become concerned after crew and business class customers were affected early on during the flight on Thursday.

All three pilots and four cabin crew 
had to be taken to hospital for checks, while a number of passengers 
were treated by paramedics, after emergency services met the aircraft in
Las Vegas.

A film insider 
told The Sun: 'It must have been a scary experience for her. We're just 
pleased to hear everybody got off the plane safely.'

Following
the incident, a BA spokesman said: 'Safety is always our top priority 
and as a precaution, the Captain decided to divert our Los Angeles to 
London service into Las Vegas, following a suspected technical problem.

'Our pilots used their training and experience throughout and the flight landed normally at Las Vegas.

'We provided hotels for the customers and we will be rebooking customers onto alternative flights out of Las Vegas as soon as possible.'

The news comes just one week after it was revealed a BA Boeing 777 was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada, as it made its way from Heathrow to Philadelphia, after suspected toxic oil fumes were reported on the flight deck.

In that instance the plane, carrying 158 passengers, made the unscheduled stop at Goose Bay, in Newfoundland, in temperatures of -30C.

British Airways said the latest aircraft has been taken out of service for investigation. It said there were early indications which pointed to a 'fault with the number three engine', according to the Sunday Express.

A spokesman said: 'The engine's maintenance programme would, of course, be in accordance with the manufacturer's regulations. Safety is always our top priority.'

The spokesman apologised to the passengers on Thursday night's flight and said: 'The smell could only be smelt on the upper deck and 20 business class customers in that area were informed of the situation. There was no unusual smell on the main deck.'

Three weeks ago the first picture was released of one of two top BA pilots who died within days of each other after complaining about being exposed to toxic oil fumes on passenger planes.

It was reported last month that Richard 
Westgate, 43, died after instructing his lawyers to sue BA for health 
and safety breaches days before fellow pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, 
passed away.

Both claimed they had been poisoned by 
the fumes that can contaminate cabin air and which regularly force 
pilots to wear oxygen masks.

Mr Westgate's lawyers want to 'give him the trial he never got' by suing the airline in a case they say will be a 'moment of truth' for the aviation industry.

They say they are on the cusp of proving in court the existence of 'aerotoxic syndrome', a chronic physical and neurological condition they insist will one day be seen as 'the new asbestos'. Thousands of pilots are currently 'unfit to fly', one specialist doctor has claimed.

A BA spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with the families of the two pilots at this very sad time and we offer our sincere condolences.Â 

'We are not aware of any legal claims relating to the two individuals. It would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate upon the individuals' cause of death.'

BA has said it is not aware of any link between the deaths and the latest incident.
