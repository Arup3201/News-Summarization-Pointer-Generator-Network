A new study reveals that 46.5 million Americans, including children, are living in poverty amounting to one in ever seven people across the country.

The alarming figures, released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday, is nothing new. It marks the sixth year in a row that the statistic has failed to improve.

Remaining stagnant at 15 per cent, the nation's poverty rate is not statistically different from the number of impoverished in 2011.

The median household income was $51,017, 
unchanged from the previous year, following two consecutive annual 
declines. The share of people without health insurance declined 
slightly, from 15.7 per cent to 15.4 per cent.

The last significant decline in the poverty rate came in 2006, during the Bush administration and before the housing bubble burst. In 2011, the poverty rate dipped to 15 per cent from 15.1 per cent, but census officials said that change was statistically insignificant.

A new report from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals that despite the end of 
the recession, the nation's poverty levels have remained largely 
unchanged across race and ethnic groups:

For the last year, the official poverty line was an annual income of $23,492 for a family of four.

The latest poverty numbers present unwelcome news for President Obama as he seeks credit for an economic turnaround after the 2007-2009 recession.

He said on Monday that congressional Republicans would reverse recent economic gains if they took uncompromising stands in connection with looming budget deadlines.

The Census Bureau's annual report offers a snapshot of the economic well-being of U.S. households for 2012, when the unemployment rate averaged 8.1 per cent after reaching an average high of 9.6 per cent in 2010.

Typically, the poverty rate tends to move in a similar direction as the unemployment rate, so many analysts had been expecting a modest decline in poverty.

The latest census data show that the gap between rich and poor was largely unchanged over the last year, after increasing steadily since 1993.

Poverty rates by age range from 1959-2012. People 65 and older were at 9.1 per cent in 2012, after hitting a record low of 8.9 percent in 2009.

GOP conservatives have been demanding a delay of Obama's new health care law as the price for supporting continued federal government spending.

The House is also expected to consider a bill this week that would cut food stamps for the poor by an estimated $4 billion annually — 10 times the size of cuts passed by the Democratic Senate — and allow states to put broad new work requirements in place for recipients.

'This lack of improvement in poverty is disappointing and discouraging,' said John Iceland, a former Census Bureau chief of the poverty and health statistics branch who is now a Penn State sociology professor. 'This lack of progress in poverty indicates that these small improvements in the economy are not yet being equally shared by all.'

Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in poverty, agreed.

'Everything's on hold, but at a bad level: poverty and income did not change much in 2012,' he said. 'So child poverty is still too high and family income is still too low. The recession may be over, but try to tell that to these struggling families. Don't expect things to change until the American economy begins to generate more jobs.'

Broken down by state, Mississippi had the highest share of poor people, at 22 percent, according to rough calculations by the Census Bureau. It was followed by Louisiana, New Mexico and Arkansas. On the other end of the scale, New Hampshire had the lowest share, at 8.1 per cent.

Poverty percentages were higher for women than men in all age ranges during 2012. Over nine million children are currently living in poverty.

The official poverty level is based on a government calculation that includes only income before tax deductions. It excludes capital gains or accumulated wealth, such as home ownership.

As a result, the official poverty rate takes into account the effects of some government benefits, such as unemployment compensation. It does not factor in noncash government aid such as tax credits and food stamps.

David Johnson, the chief of the Census Bureau's household economics division, estimated that unemployment benefits helped keep 1.7 million people out of poverty.

If non-cash government aid were counted in the official formula, the earned income tax credit would have lifted another 5.5 million people above the poverty threshold. Food stamps would have boosted 4 million people, lowering the poverty rate to 13.7 per cent.

The slight dip in Americans without health coverage meant 48 million people were without insurance. The drop was due mostly to increases in government coverage, such as Medicaid and Medicare. The number of people covered by employer-provided health insurance remained flat.

The decline was modest compared to a bigger drop in 2011, which occurred due to increased coverage for young adults under the new health care law.

Because the main provisions of the Affordable Care Act don't take effect until 2014, the latest census numbers offer a baseline number of uninsured by which increased coverage and effectiveness of the law will be measured. Many conservative Republicans remain committed to repealing it.

Starting next year, the government will offer tax credits for people without access to job-based health insurance to buy private coverage through new markets, called exchanges, in each state. Open enrollment starts Oct 1.

The new health care law also expands Medicaid to cover millions more low-income people, but so far only 24 states plus Washington, D.C., have gone along with the expansion.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by next year, the health law will reduce the number of uninsured in the U.S. by about 25 per cent.

By 2017, it is projected that 92 per cent of eligible Americans will have health insurance, a 10 percentage point increase from today's level.
