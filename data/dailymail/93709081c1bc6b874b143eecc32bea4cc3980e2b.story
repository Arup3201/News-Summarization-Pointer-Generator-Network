Stars including Franck Ribery, Mario Gotze and Arjen Robben were all in attendance as the team waited to board the flight.

The 2015 Ballon d'Or nominee Manuel Neuer also travelled with the squad; although team-mate Xherdan Shaqiri wasn't seen ahead of his move to Italian side Inter Milan.

Bayern revealed that the stocky 23-year-old, who joined the club in 2012, will undergo a medical in Italy on Friday before signing the deal.

The Allianz Arena outfit also confirmed that they had loaned out talented 19-year-old midfielder Pierre Hojbjerg to Augsburg until the end of the season to gain match practice while also extending the Denmark international's contract by two years to 2018.

Despite some good spells Shaqiri has failed to hold down a regular starting spot under coach Guardiola and had repeatedly hinted at leaving in the transfer window.

He made three starts in 17 league games this season and has scored a total of 11 league goals in 52 Bundesliga appearances for the Bavarians.

There were no details regarding the length of his contract with the 2010 Champions League winners, who have also signed Germany international Lukas Podolski on loan from Arsenal.

Hojbjerg, Bayern's youngest-ever Bundesliga player, making his debut at age 17 in 2013, has played only 17 league games - eight in the current campaign - since joining from Brondby in 2012,
