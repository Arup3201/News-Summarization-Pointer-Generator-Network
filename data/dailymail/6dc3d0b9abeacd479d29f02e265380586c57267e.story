A former high school student is suing his former science teacher and school district for distress he suffered as a result of a sexual relationship with her -- and says it delayed his plans to join the military.

The student, using the pseudonym Mark Smith, claimed in a lawsuit filed on Friday that teacher Rachelle Heenan took advantage of him, The Star-Telegram reports.

Smith met Heenan in her class as a 17-year-old senior attending Hollenstein Career and Technology Center in February 2012. He had planned to join the Marine Corps as a diesel mechanic and was scheduled to do so one day after graduation.

The two soon exchanged 'sexting' conversations,' the paper reports. They later met in a gym parking lot and checked into a hotel where they had sex.Â 

Heenan also allegedly engaged Smith in multiple sexual encounters -- including at school events, in hotels and her in own car.

Heenan, the Star-Telegram says, was placed on administrative leave in May 2012 and indicted in February 2013 for an improper relationship between an educator and a student. She also was reportedly given five years of deferred adjudicated probation in a plea bargain.

Heenan's page on the school's website said she has been married for ten years and has two children, WFAA reported in July 2012.

Smith's attorney Bobbie Edmonds told the paper the illicit relationship damaged him both mentally and emotionally -- and that his plans to join the Marine Corps were delayed.

'He was mentally impacted by what happened,' Edmonds said. 'He was impressionable, and there was the age difference and the fact that she was a teacher,' she said.

In court documents, Edmonds says Heenan 'assaulted, raped and battered [Smith] in her capacity of teacher/educator, in violation of the law.'

Smith also reportedly damaged school district property, costing over $24,000. Edmonds told the paper that emotional trauma related to the relationship caused him to act out.

The lawsuit also reportedly claims that the Eagle Mountain-Saginaw school district 'failed to provide proper supervision, failed to act to warn or otherwise protect young victims and failed to secure the school premises from the sexual assaults that occurred on school premises and at school sponsored events and activities.'
