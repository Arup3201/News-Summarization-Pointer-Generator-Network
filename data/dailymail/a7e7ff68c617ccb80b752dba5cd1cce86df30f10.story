A professional wakeskater achieved a world’s first after successfully negotiating the water and surrounding snow of the Studeni Potok creek, known by Bosnian locals as the Dragon’s Tail.

According to Red Bull, Brian Grubb travelled to the mountain of Bjelasnica, which sits 25km from where the 1984 Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo, to attempt the experimental feat.

Dating back to the late 1970s, the sport of wakeskating started in the form of freeboarding or wakesurfing.

Brain had to find a balanced speed so that he would be able to stay afloat while on the water and on his feet while on the snow

Riders would originally surf behind boats with long boards until the sport evolved and shorter boards, which were easier to do tricks with, were preferred.

Different to the similar water sport of wakeboarding, wakestakers are not attached to their boards meaning crashes are more prevalent.

Brian initially intended to ride the creek in the summer, but later deduced that it would be easier to do so in the winter as connecting a fluid line, which would allow him to move between the snow and water, would be more achievable.

Pulled by a 1300ft winch line, the video shows the 34-year-old negotiating the creek effortlessly.

Carving his way through the water, he switches seamlessly between the untouched snow and the water before jumping into the air and landing a challenging trick.

Despite the fluidity of his movements however, the biggest challenge faced by the wakeskater during the experiment involved him finding a balanced speed.

Speaking on the video, Brian said: ‘I wanted different speeds for being in the snow and then in the water.

‘I had to be going faster in the water so I didn't sink but then in the snow going that speed just felt really fast so it was kind of challenging.

‘But once we got the line figured out it was really fun to just session it.’

Although Brian does achieve a smooth and successful run of the creek, his experimental wakeboarding session is not without its fair share of impressive wipe-outs.

And a ramp incorporated into the course – which later produces one of the videos most impressive moments – has Brian crashing into the snowy banks on a number of occasions.

Speaking on the video, Brian said: ‘We ultimately just want to inspire people to think outside the box and maybe to take a sport that you would only see in the summer time into the winter and into the snow.

A pioneer in his field, Brian has had some impressive wins on the Pro Wakeskate Tour, Vans Triple Crown, U.S. Nationals, the Wakeskating World Championships, and the Byerly Toe Jam Tour

‘We really had fun riding in these conditions and being here in Bosnia.’
