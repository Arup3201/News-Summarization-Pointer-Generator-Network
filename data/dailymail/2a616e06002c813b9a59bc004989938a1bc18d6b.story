A father dashed back into his burning home to save two of his five children.

Three other children, including a seven-month-old baby, were killed during the blaze in Hammond, Indiana after the fire was started by a space heater.

The children's 27-year-old father Andre Young is in critical condition after heading back into the inferno to save two of his other sons, aged two and six.

The mother was not home at the time and the two surviving children are said to be in good condition.

The fire broke out around 10:20 pm on Wednesday night.

Firefighters found the body of 7-month-old Jayden five feet from the front door. Nearby lay the bodies of his sister, Alexia, 3, and brother, Dasani, 4, holding onto each other.

'That broke my heart,' said Hammond Chief Fire Inspector Michael Opink told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Upstairs neighbor Jasmine rice said that she saw Mr Young running out of the house with flames coming from his back. He fell to the ground immediately and began rolling around in the snow to douse the flames.

'I heard him yelling, ‘Everybody get out! Get out! My babies! My babies,’' Rice said Thursday outside the charred two-flat rental house.

She told the paper that after smelling smoke, she initially thought it was from something she left on.

Then she heard someone scream 'Fire!' leading her boyfriend to grab their kids and escape the burning building.

Possible causes: The Hammond Fire Department are investigating a house fire where three children died

Once outside, Rice saw her neighbor Young on fire and her boyfriend attempted to go into the family's bottom apartment to see if anyone needed help.

At that point though, flames were already shooting out dangerously and he couldn't get in.

'The smoke, the flames, everything happened so fast,' Ms Rice said. 

Firefighters found at least three space heaters inside the house, including a portable propane-powered model.

Investigators say they found a bed, rocker and piles of clothes - items that could easily catch fire if someone knocked the heater over.

'There was so much fuel for the fire to do what it did,' Opinker said. '\these kids had no chance.'

Rice and her boyfriend lived in the unit upstairs and had let the Youngs run an extension cord from their apartment to provide electricity.

'I remember once they had had a propane tank, and it had, like, an open flame,' Rice said. 'I just thought, they've got all these little kids running around and that could get knocked over so easily.'

Survivors: Three of the Young family children perished in the blaze but 27-year-old father Andre Young was able to save two of his sons

Breaking in: When firefighters arrived on the scene, they found the father lying on the ground badly burned. They had a hard time getting into the house since two doors seemed to be blocked with furniture

Tragic loss: The mother was not home at the time, and was informed at the hospital that three of her children died in the blaze

When firefighters arrived on the scene, they found Mr Young lying on the ground badly burnt.

He managed to get two of his children out of the house, but the rest were still trapped inside.

The fire may have been caused by a space heater connected to a propane tank

Firefighters had trouble getting into the burning building because two of the doors were blocked by what appeared to be furniture.

By the time they finally busted in, it was too late. Seven-month-old Jayden Young, 3-year-old Alexia Young and 4-year-old Dasani Young were all pronounced dead shortly after midnight and found within six feet of the front door. 

Healing: As of Thursday morning, father Andre Young was still in critical condition but his two surviving sons were in good condition

The father and his two surviving children were rushed to Stroger Hospital in Chicago which has a burn unit.

As of Thursday morning, the father was still in critical condition but his two sons were in good condition and even talking to each other.

The mother was not home at the time, but showed up at one point while her house was burning down and was informed at the hospital that three of her children had died in the blaze.

Chief fire inspector Michael Opinker said he believes space heaters played a role in starting the blaze, in an interview with Nwitimes.com.

According to neighbor Nicki Flick, 70, the Young family had been living in the lower half of the house since last Spring, and since at least last summer had been living without electricity. Ms Flick says she heard a strange sound coming form the house one day and went over to find the mother who said it was a generator.

'She said,"Well, it's better than not having any lights"' Ms Flick recalls.

She said she would often watch from her window as the children played with toy trains and trucks — always with at least one of their parents — outside their home.

Sometimes an older son would push a younger sibling in a stroller. Other times the father would teach his kids to somersault.

'He was just very friendly, very boisterous with his kids … they would just hang off of him,' Flick said. 'They didn’t have any water in the house, but I never saw the kids grubby.'

Living conditions in the rental property had been dire for months, however.

Hammond city records show the electricity was shut off in March, and gas service a month later. Water service was stopped in October

Records indicate the building owners, Real Estate Equity Solutions of Indiana, LLC had not allowed in inspectors and ignored citations and penalties — including a $2,600 fine in August.

'We were a week away from getting an order from the court so we could go in,' City Attorney Kristina Kantar said. 'Obviously, if our inspectors found people living there without water or power or heat, we would not let them stay there.'

Christian Bartholomew, attorney for Real Estate Equity Solutions, told the Chicago Tribune that he did not know whether utility services were connected at the house. City records show the property had changed owners in 2012.

'My client was attempting to coordinate an inspection with the city. I know there had been difficulty contacting the tenant living there,' Bartholomew said. “We are still looking at the situation, and we are taking it very seriously

Ms Flick remembers the Young kids playing outside, always accompanied by a parent, and how they would run to meet their dad when he returned home at the end of the day.

'He loved all those kids,' she said.

According to fire officials, the family had been using propane to heat the home in the middle of winter.

'Unfortunately I see too many of these,' Hammond Deputy Fire Chief Kevin Margat said.
