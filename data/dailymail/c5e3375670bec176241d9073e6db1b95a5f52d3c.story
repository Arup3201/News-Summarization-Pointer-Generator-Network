A young family of five and two toddlers sleeping over at their Kentucky home were wiped out in a devastating fire yesterday.

Local reports identified the two adults killed in the blaze as pregnant mother-of-three Nina Asher, 22, and her fiance Jesse Disney, who announced their engagement last Saturday

Asher's three children from a previous relationship William, 3, Camden, 2, and baby Abigail were also killed in the unexplained fire that overtook their rural home in Gray, Knox County.

Two other little girls, aged 2 and 3, were in the house on a sleepover and also perished in the blaze, according to the Lexington Herald Leader.

They haven't yet been named.

Investigators are now trying to work out what started the fire around 10am yesterday but say they don't suspect any foul play.

Autopsies will be carried out on the young victims on Tuesday, authorities said.

Relatives were left devastated by the blaze which claimed the lives of aspiring musician Jesse and his wife-to-be.

Jesse's parents live in a property which backs onto the home that was ripped apart by flames but it was another neighbor who first spotted smoke bellowing from the house.

They called 911 and also alerted family members who rushed to the scene to try and save their loved ones.

However, by that stage it was already too late.

Jesse's aunt Maria told the local paper: 'They were full of life. They were beautiful. It was a beautiful little family.'

The couple had been busily renovating their home in the days before the fire and were excited for married life.

They had lived in the property, owned by a relative of Jesse, for around two months.

On Friday, Nina Asher wrote on Facebook about how Disney had been 'working his butt off to get our house done' adding: 'So excited to see what it looks like when he is done'.

She also posted some pictures of flowers he had bought her the night before the fire and on a picture of Jesse and her two sons Camden and William she wrote: 'That's my men I love them so much'

In a post to a friend she added: ' I'm fixing to get married to a wonderful man, we have our own house and everything. I'm doing better now I ever have.'Relatives said she had also been for her first scan on Friday and had returned home with a picture of the unborn baby - it would have been Jesse's first child.

He posted news of their engagement on the social networking site last Saturday and had a close bond with Nina's children, posting pictures of them all together smiling happily for the camera. 

According to the local paper Nina's body was discovered by the door of the property by a family member who rushed inside to save them. Jesse's body was further inside and they had both died of smoke inhalation.

Relatives say Jesse was found on his way to the children's bedroom, making a desperate bid to save them.

The father of the three children, William Gray, visited the house today.

'They were the best kids in the world,' he told the Herald Leader.

Sgt Jackie Pickrell said investigators were still trying to establish the cause of the blaze yesterday.

It is believed all seven victims died of smoke inhalation.

Relatives said the family had stayed up late for the sleepover the night before and were planning to sleep in late.

It is believed the fire started in a bedroom at the back of the house which was believed to be empty. It was one of the rooms the couple had been renovating.
