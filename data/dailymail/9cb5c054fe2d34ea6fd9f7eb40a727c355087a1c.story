A luxury hen hotel has opened in order to cash in on a boom in the number of families owning chickens.

The unusual lodgings, dubbed Fowlty Towers, is a plush 'resort' that gives visiting hens a five star, all-inclusive stay while their owners are away.

The lodgings cost £7 per coop per night but no cocks are allowed due to their noisy crowing that wakes up the neighbours.

Fowlty Towers is the brainchild of Julie 
Smith, who started looking after her own chickens to make her get out of
bed early in the mornings.

Each feathered guest can roam in 3ft long runs attached to the enclosures and are let out once a day.

As well as being fed pellets, the hens are also treated to lettuce, watermelon, and mixed corn in moderation.

Despite owning 12 chickens of her own, Ms Smith has launched the business after realising people struggled to find anyone to look after their hens during holidays.

Julie, 54, an administrator from Cowden, near Sevenoaks, Kent, said: 'I really enjoyed looking after my own hens but then I started looking after some friends' hens when they were on holiday.

'I then realised there was a niche in the market and launched Fowlty Towers.

'We use plastic Eglu Cubes with 3ft long runs attached to them and they are about as fox proof as you can possibly get.

'They can hold up to 10 chickens but I feel it is better to only have between four and six in there.

Cracking batch: Julie has more eggs from her guests than she knows what to do with

'It is important that the chickens 
that stay together all come from the same family, otherwise you can have
a pecking order problem and they become aggressive.'

Around 700,000 Britons keep hens, according to a the British Hen Welfare Trust. Celebrity  owners include Jamie Oliver,  Jeremy Clarkson and Liz Hurley.

But a recent study by the Royal Veterinary College found that many urban householders have a lack of poultry disease knowledge and consequently rarely vaccinate their animals, which could have serious implications on disease control and animal welfare.
