A mother has released shocking pictures of her brain-damaged son fighting for his life in hospital after he was attacked during a night out in Cheltenham.

Liam Malone shattered his skull on the pavement when he collapsed from the punch and was left in a coma for 
three weeks.

The one-punch attack even left the 26-year-old's brain so swollen that part of his skull had to be removed and placed into his stomach for 'safe-keeping' until it could be reattached again.

outside a nightclub in Cheltenham. His mother Maureen has released 
photos of him in intensive care to show the impact of just one punch

Now his mother Maureen Malone has released images of her son in a coma, to highlight the consequences that just one punch can have.

The 52-year-old said: ‘What happened to Liam 
was utterly mindless. It’s a miracle he survived and doctors told us 
he’s very lucky to be alive.

‘To look at Liam now, you wouldn’t know anything is wrong, but he’ll never fully recover.

‘It
 just goes to show what a single punch can do. Liam will have to suffer the consequences of that punch 
for the rest of his life.’

Mr Malone had been clubbing with his younger brother Conor, 22, on June 2 last year when they got into an argument with Christopher Perrett, who bizarrely taunted Mr Malone about eating plankton.

Perrett - who was jailed for 40 months for the attack - punched Mr Malone in the back of the head, leaving him to fall to the ground and shatter his skull.

The young man, who suffered a bleed on the brain, had to have part of 
his skull removed and put into his stomach until the swelling on his 
brain was reduced and doctors could reattach it

Mr Malone - who has had trouble speaking 
since the attack - was rushed to hospital and later transferred to 
Bristol's Frenchay hospital where he spent seven hours having emergency 
brain surgery.

It took three months for the young man to have rehabilitation and eventually be released from hospital.

Ms Malone said: ‘He was in theatre for over 
seven hours and the neurosurgeon told us afterwards it was touch and go 
whether he was going to make it.

‘I was terrified of losing him. Conor and I spent the next week at his bedside, willing him to pull through.’

Mr Malone had suffered a massive bleed on his brain and surgeons removed a section of his skull to relieve pressure.

It was put into his stomach until medics were able to reattach it when he began to recover.

Ms Malone said: ‘They joked they’d put it there for safe-keeping, so they didn’t lose it.’

Mr Malone spent three weeks in a coma 
and almost another three months being treated on a specialist brain injury unit.

The attack has left him with weakness on the right side of his body, as well as speech problems.

Perrett
 tried to claim self-defence over the incident but was convicted of grievous bodily harm after a
 trial last month at Gloucester Crown Court. He jailed for 40 months.

The court heard Perret had convictions for assault by beating in 2011, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2012.

Ms Malone said: ‘Conor was trying to act as peace-maker, but Perrett was having none of it.

'He threw a punch at the back of Liam’s head, and he just collapsed to the ground, smashing his skull on the pavement.’
