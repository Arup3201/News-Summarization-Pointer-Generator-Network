The brother of murdered teenager Jimmy Mizen has been mugged at knife-point - just yards from the bakery where his sibling was killed.

George Mizen, 15, was walking along the road opposite the Three Cooks Bakery in Lee, south-east London, when he was approached by a teenage boy.

The thug threatened to stab him unless he handed over his iPhone and iPod, before taking the possessions and fleeing the scene.

It comes just six years after George's older brother was murdered at the bakery in 2008 in a crime that provoked national outrage.

Jimmy, 16, a former altar boy, bled to death after 19-year-old Jake Fahri, threw a glass dish at his throat, severing his jugular vein.

Yesterday, George's mother Margaret told the Sunday Mirror how her son had immediately handed over his possessions for fear of being attacked like his brother.

She added that the attack had brought back horrific memories, saying: 'When this happened we were 
devastated. One reason in particular is that George is precious to all 
of us in this family. The second is this attack happened directly 
opposite to where Jimmy was killed.

Scene: George, 15, was walking along the road opposite the Three Cooks Bakery in Lee, south-east London, when he was approached by a teenage boy. His brother Jimmy was murdered at the bakery in May 2008

'It was kind of like déjà vu, kind of like history repeating itself.'

Following the robbery, George immediately called the police, who tracked down his attacker.

The teenager was arrested and is believed to have later pleaded guilty to robbery at youth court.

Speaking of the thug's arrest, Mrs Mizen said: 'I did an impact statement and in that we talked about Jimmy as this boy wouldn’t have known about him and the pain that these things caused.'

Incredibly, she said George, who works for the Jimmy Mirzen Foundation in his spare time, had told her he did not want his attacker to go to prison.

She added that the teenager had previously been attacked by three youths in the wake of his brother's death. The trio were arrested following the 2012 assault and forced to meet George face-to-face, she said.

Jimmy was murdered in May 2008 after Fahri started threatening him in the bakery in Burnt Ash Hill.

During the altercation, Fahri hurled a 12-inch hot glass dish at the schoolboy's chin, piercing his neck and severing his jugular vein.

Jimmy managed to stagger into the
rear of the bakery, and into a cupboard, to
 shield himself from Fahri, where his older 
brother Tommy found him covered in blood. He died in his brother's arms.

In 2009, Fahri was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 14 years after being convicted of murder at London's Old Bailey.

A Met Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can confirm a robbery took 
place in Burnt Ash Hill, near Lee railway station, on Monday, June 9.

'It was investigated. A 15-year-old boy was arrested and pleaded guilty to robbery at youth court.

'He was given a nine-month youth referral order. He also had to pay £85 costs and a £10 victim surcharge.'

The spokesman added that he could not confirm the names of those involved in the incident.
