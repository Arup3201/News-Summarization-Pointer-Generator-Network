Harry Kane turned to social media on Thursday, full of emotion after England manager Roy Hodgson called him up for the first time.

The Tottenham striker talked of ‘pride’ and ‘honour’ on Twitter after being named in the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania next Friday and the friendly in Italy four days later.

Kane, who has scored 26 goals for Tottenham this season, merits his place alongside England captain Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck. Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling is also in the squad but a niggling toe injury could see him play against Lithuania and sit out the Italy clash.

‘The whole country is excited to see Harry Kane,’ said Hodgson. ‘His rise has been fantastic. He deserves his chance. He hasn’t been in the squad before, but he has to show he belongs.’ Beyond that, poor Kane discovered what it is really like to be a senior international when he was immediately caught in a club-versus-country row.

First the background. The lure of the Aussie dollar has seen Tottenham agree to play Sydney FC on May 30, six days after the final game of the Premier League season.

That same weekend, the England squad meet to prepare for a friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 in Dublin, followed by the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia on June 14. There is also a possibility that Kane, a regular in Gareth Southgate’s Under 21 squad, will be selected for the European Championship starting on June 17. 

‘Playing for England at Under 21 level is more important than a friendly in Australia and I would be hypocritical if I didn’t give that answer,’ said Hodgson.

‘This business about being tired — he’s played quite a lot of games but he’s not played any more than Wayne Rooney, Jordan Henderson, Joe Hart, Gary Cahill and lots of other players.

‘If he needs a rest there’s a great opportunity when the season ends, before our Under 21s get together. You can’t expect me to say, “Oh no, I understand he will play in Australia and be resting when the Under 21s pitch up”.’

Still, Tottenham were adamant on Thursday that Kane will travel to Australia to fulfil the Sydney fixture.

Kane, 21, has played 42 times for Spurs this season and his goals in three competitions — Premier League, Europa League and Capital One Cup — have earned him international recognition.

Inevitably, boss Mauricio Pochettino would prefer the potential PFA Player of the Year to put his feet up this summer. There is a fear of burn-out.

‘We will speak (with Hodgson). It’s a good chance to speak because England train here,’ said Pochettino after England’s squad of 24 was announced.

‘We always try to find what is best for the player. We need to understand every position, but we have a good relationship and after that (talks with Hodgson) we will take a decision.’

As for Kane, he is concerned only with proving himself to the England manager.

‘I’ll be aiming to compete and get myself in the team,’ he said. ‘There are a lot of great players there and I haven’t had time to think about what’s happened but I’m enjoying every minute and want it to continue.’ 

Beyond the Kane situation, Hodgson had to attend to some general housekeeping at Wembley on Thursday, such as the knockout blow Phil Bardsley seemed to land on his pal Rooney at the captain’s Cheshire home last month.

Hodgson said he had no view on the incident, which was revealed last weekend in a Sunday newspaper. ‘You will have to guess whether I am concerned but Wayne’s celebration against Tottenham was one way to take the sting out of the situation,’ said Hodgson.

On Monday, when the squad meet at St George’s Park, it will be the first time Hodgson has seen them since November. He had hoped to meet the players at a dinner in January but club managers were against the idea.

Instead, Hodgson recorded a video message which was sent to the squad via England’s video analyst Andy Scoulding and was downloaded on to their iPads. ‘I don’t want to do the Sherlock Holmes bit to find out who has and who hasn’t watched it,’ said Hodgson. ‘I did an introduction to each video and then Gary Neville and Ray Lewington talked over the actual clips.

‘It will break the ice that can develop when the last game was in November and your next one is in March.

‘Whether they found it a worthwhile exercise, I don’t know. If it’s not, then it’s an awful lot of work to do for nothing.’
