Friends said the 19 year old had to be coaxed into appearing as the star prosecution witness in the trial of George Zimmerman.Scroll down for video of the witness

Rachel Jeantel told friends she was apprehensive about taking the stand and had to be persuaded by state prosecutors to appear

On Friday Jeantel clashed with Zimmerman's defense attorney Don West - replying 'That's retarded sir' to one of his questions

'She did not want to be there, no way,' said a friend who knew Rachel from Norland High School in Miami, Florida.

'She was not happy to take part. She did not want to do it, but out of respect for Trayvon's parents agreed to go to the trial.'

According to friends, prosecutors made frequent trips to see Rachel at the three bedroom condo she shares with her mother in Miami Gardens, Florida.

The teenager alluded to her reluctance to appear in court in a tweet message that has since been deleted.

Friends said 19-year-old Rachel had to be coaxed into appearing as the star prosecution witness in the trial of George Zimmerman.

Witness Rachel Jeantel smiles towards the end of her second day testimony during George Zimmerman's murder trial for 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida

She sent a message talking about 'jackass lawyers on my ass.'

The tweet - along with others about underage drinking and getting high - have since been deleted.

Rachel was on the phone with 17 year old Trayvon when he told her he was being followed as he walked back to his fatherâ€™s home in Sanford, Florida.

While billed as the prosecution star witness in the opening week of the trial her credibility has been tested.

The teenager admitted lying about her age and attending the dead teen's funeral.

She was involved in testy exchanges with defense attorney Don West, at one point telling him 'That's retarded, sir' in reply to one of his questions.

Until her appearance at the trial she was simply known as Witness No 8.

The teenager, who admitted to lying about her age and attending the dead teen's funeral, has involved in testy exchanges with defense attorney Don West

The fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, 17, by George Zimmerman took place on the night of February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida

Cursive: Rachel Jeantel's letter to Trayvon's parents, which was written by a friend but signed by her

'I was on the phone when Trevon [sic] decided to go to the corner store It started to rain so he decided to walk through another complex because it was rainy to [sic] hard.

'He started walking then noticed 
someone was following him. Then he decided to find a shortcut cause the 
man wouldn't follow him. Then he said the man didn't follow him again.

'Then
he looked back and saw the man again. The man started getting closer. 
Then Trevon [sic] turned around and said Why are you following me!! Then
I heard him fall.

'Then
the phone hung up. I called back and got no response. In my mind I 
thought it was just a fight. Then I found out this tragic story.

'Thank 
you, Diamond Eugene'

The teen was also forced to admit 
that a letter she wrote to Martin's parents after the 17 year old's 
death had been written by a friend.

Rachel
told the court in Sanford, Florida, she was only able to read out her 
name from the letter and was unable to understand cursive writing.

Jeantel
said she wrote the letter for the teen's parents so she could give her 
account of his last phone call before being shot dead in February 2012.

She told the packed courtroom that she never intended for it to be made public.

The
letter said: 'He started walking then noticed someone was following 
him. Then he decided to find a shortcut cause the man wouldn't follow 
him. Then he said the man didn't follow him again.

'Then
he looked back and saw the man again. The man started getting closer. 
Then Trevon [sic] turned around and said Why are you following me!! Then I heard him fall.

'Then
the phone hung up. I called back and got no response. In my mind I 
thought it was just a fight. Then I found out this tragic story. Thank 
you.'

Friends who live 
near her home in Miami Gardens, Miami, describe Rachel as a 'good soul' 
who got mixed up with the wrong crowd and failed to graduate from High 
School.

She is 
believed to have left school at the age of 16. School officials at 
Norland High School refused to comment about the 19 year old's 
attendance record or confirm she was a student at the school.

Friends
who know Rachel said the teen, who prefers to be known by her nickname 
Diamond Dee, would have been left shattered by her time in the witness 
box.

When asked about why she lied about not going to the funeral, she said: 'I felt guilty...I was the last person that talked to their son', before breaking down in tears

Clean-up: More than 40 tweets were removed from Rachel Jeantel's Twitter account which spoke about alcohol and getting high

Testimony: Rachel said Trayvon told her he was going to try to lose the man and go home, but Zimmerman kept following him

Rachel has not been allowed to make contact with her friends by phone while a witness in the trial.

'I'm sure she feels bad, feels humiliated,' said Francina Belloit.

'It was nasty what happened to her in the trial.

'They made her look as if she were on trial. It was not right.'

Dee
Jackson, who knows the family, said she had to turn off the television 
watching Rachel being quizzed by the defense attorneys.

'They're just drilling her and then the parents were like getting upset so I didn't want to see anymore,' she said.

Rachel, who is off Haitian descent, was born in Miami and grew up in North Miami.

Eight years ago the family moved to Miami Gardens and Rachel attended Norland High School.

One
friend told MailOnline that Rachel was absent often from school after 
getting mixed up with a wrong crowd she had met through her older 
brothers.

'Her attendance wasn't the best,' said the friend.

'She liked to party and have a good time but that does not make her a bad person.'
