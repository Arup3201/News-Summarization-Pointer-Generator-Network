Two teenagers who called 911 after they saw a kidnap victim pleading for help from inside a car today recounted the harrowing chase - and how they feared for their lives when the alleged kidnapper saw them.

Jamal Harris, 17, was a passenger in 19-year-old Aaron Arias's car when he looked over at another vehicle at a stoplight and spotted a blonde woman in the backseat who he thought was cute.

But when he took a closer look, he realized something was seriously wrong - she was mouthing, 'Help me!'

This simple glance led to a 12-minute car chase, a frantic 911 call and the arrest of Charles Atkins Lewis Jr., who had allegedly forced the 25-year-old woman into her own car at gunpoint in Dallas.

Speaking on CNN's New Day on Friday, the heroic teens explained that they were driving through Seagoville as they went to collect a friend from work when Harris spotted the woman in the car.

'I was looking at her thinking, "She's pretty beautiful",' Harris said, adding that he was trying to get his friend to look at her too.

'But I could tell from her facial expression that what she was telling me was very serious... She was mouthing "Help me".'

He told Arias what he was seeing but the friend was skeptical and said he needed to focus on driving.

But Arias also became suspicious when the light switched to green and the car took off too fast.

Saved: A dashcam image shows a woman being helped by police after two teenagers saw her mouthing 'help me' through her car window. She had allegedly been kidnapped that evening

Then he saw the woman hitting the back 
window to get their attention - so decided to follow them. They called 
911 and frantically recounted what they had witnessed.

Arrest: Charles Atkins Lewis Jr. allegedly kidnapped the woman from outside an office block

'I'm on the highway,' Arias tells the 
Kaufman County Sheriff's Office dispatcher in the recording, which was 
released earlier this week.

'I'm witnessing
a robbery; not a robbery - a kidnapping.

'It's me and another guy, so we're 
checking out the girl in the backseat because we're like, "OK, she's 
kind of attractive",' Arias told the operator in the dramatic call. And then, all of the sudden the guy is turned back, looking at us.'

Although
both the teenagers said they would 'obviously' do the same again, they 
admitted they began to feel more nervous towards the end of the chase.

'Close
to the end, he was slowing down and I was slowing down - he knew he was
being followed,' Arias said.

'He could've done something to her or us.'

Officers were on the scene minutes later and pulled the car over.

Dashcam footage, which was also 
released to NBC5, shows the woman being taken to safety by police 
officers.

'Thank God. You guys are awesome,' Arias 
told the dispatcher as police arrived on the scene. 'Oh my God. Oh my 
God. Get him! Oh my God.'

Lucky: They were driving to collect a friend when they stopped at a light and looked over to see the woman

Chase: Arias and Harris followed the car for 12 minutes until police arrived and arrested the alleged kidnapper

Little did the teenagers know the 
extent of the alleged kidnapping; NBC5 reported that police found a gun 
and knife inside the car when they apprehended her alleged captor, Charles Atkins Lewis Jr.

The woman had been kidnapped late on August 25 as she left a downtown Dallas office building.

Lewis allegedly smacked her across the head with a pistol and forced her into her own car. He drove off and a few minutes later, he threw her cell phone from the window of the moving car.

They
were eventually stopped by police officers nearly 40 miles away in 
Kaufman. Arias, a 19-year-old Texas A&M freshman, followed them 
there with the dispatcher on the phone.

The woman was checked by paramedics but was not hurt. Arias said he met her after the rescue and she gave him a hug.

Scene: She was snatched from this downtown block in Dallas on August 15 and forced into her own car. Lewis allegedly drove for more than 30 miles with her captive before he was pulled over by police

'I would describe it as the best hug I have ever gotten,' he told NBC.

Asked
if he considered himself a hero, he said: 'She says we saved her life. I
guess you could say we did. But I don't want to be that person who says
they're a hero.'

Lewis remains in jail on $50,000 bond. He is charged with aggravated kidnapping.
