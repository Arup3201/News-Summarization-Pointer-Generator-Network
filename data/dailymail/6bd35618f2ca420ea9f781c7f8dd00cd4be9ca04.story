She was on the verge of becoming a Lady – and frequenting the nation’s stately homes with her Eton-educated husband.

But it seems Zeaphena Badley, 31, has been anything but ladylike since her aristocrat ex-fiance the Hon Nicholas Knatchbull called off their wedding.

Instead of visiting Buckingham Palace to meet the Royal Family, friends of her former in-laws to be, she has been attacking police, shouting abusively about the Queen, and staying in one of Her Majesty’s prisons.

Smoking: Pregnant Zeaphena Badley outside court. She has been found guilty of assaulting three police officers

Badley, who was engaged for 18 months to Knatchbull, also known as Lord Romsey and in line to inherit a £100million fortune, appeared before magistrates last week.

She had earlier been found guilty of assaulting three police officers, punching, kicking and spitting at them while apparently on drugs at Notting Hill Carnival in August.

The portrait of a lady presented in court was, in the words of one victim, of a ‘vile and disgusting individual intent on attacking as many police officers as possible’.

It certainly confirmed Badley’s declaration to the Daily Mail last year that: ‘I’m not like Kate Middleton, not at all.’

The court heard Badley had been a guest at Knatchbull’s 60-room Broadlands estate in Hampshire, but is now ‘sofa surfing’ at friends’ London flats and using soup kitchens.

Following the attack – shortly after her engagement ended – she spent 35 days in Holloway prison  in London. 

In her latest court appearance, 
magistrates heard that the mother of two was seven months pregnant and 
she was given a suspended six-month sentence and 12 months’ probation 
with 20 compulsory ‘structured supervision for women’ sessions.

Her mingling with the upper class does not appear to have taught her manners. She was late for her first hearing, and on hearing the guilty verdict shouted at the district judge: ‘F****** a*******. I’m seven months pregnant. There is no justice in this country.’

Outside she smoked a cigarette despite her pregnancy, ignoring a prominent no smoking sign.

Her former fiance, 32, is himself no stranger to the seamier side of life. After Eton, where he helped mentor Prince William, a family friend, he sank into drug addiction.

He attended rehab before meeting half-Jamaican Badley. Their engagement emerged in 2010.

He is now engaged again, with nurse Raz Tedros, 28, set to be the 9th Baroness Brabourne.

At Badley’s trial at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court last month, prosecutor Paul Mitchell described her assault on police officers Stephanie Grayson, Maggie Saliwell and John Taylor: ‘The defendant was shouting, “What the f*** are you doing?” and turned to officer Grayson and punched her cheek.’

He added she ‘spat at officer Saliwell’s face and then kicked her’, shouting: ‘Only Jah can judge me now. There is no Queen, she’s not real, so there are no laws.’

Badley called one officer an ‘ugly bitch’ and tried to bite another.

He said: ‘The officers believed she was under the influence of drugs.’

Miss Saliwell said: ‘She was a vile, disgusting individual intent on attacking as many police officers as possible and showed no remorse.’ 

The drug addict and chain smoker had already been convicted of assaulting two police officers last year. Badley denied the offences, claims she was assaulted, and plans to appeal.

Magistrate Andy Robinson told her: ‘You have shown no remorse. Your previous record is horrendous.’
