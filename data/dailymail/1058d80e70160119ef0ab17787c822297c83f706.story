A teacher who was fired after her estranged husband began a period of threatening behavior to the school and children where she worked, has had some legislation brought about in her honor.

Carie Charlesworth was fired in April from her position at Holy Trinity School in El Cajon near San Diego.

She had taught at schools within the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego for 14 years, however she lost her job because of her ex-husbands' menacing, abusive behavior.

California Governor Jerry Brown has now signed legislation that would protect victims of domestic violence from losing their jobs or being discriminated at work.

'It’s incredibly gratifying to know that thousands of domestic violence victims won’t have to experience what I did — the devastation and financial insecurity of losing a job and their professional identity just because they are victims of domestic violence,' Carie Charlesworth said in a statement.

Church officials have declined to comment, but earlier had sent a notice to parents, parishioners and others.

The second-grade teacher was fired over campus safety concerns after her estranged husband was spotted on campus.

In January of this year Ms. Charlesworth was forced to call police after what she called ‘a very bad weekend with him.’

The next day, she spoke to her principal to warn them about her ex-husband, Martin Charlesworth.

Not long afterwards he showed up at the school parking lot - forcing the entire school to go into lockdown for 30 minutes. He was arrested.

She was immediately put on leave, and her four children were barred from returning to the school.

'I was treated like the criminal,' Charlesworth said later. When she was terminated, 'My world fell apart. I felt victimized all over again.'

Three months later Charlesworth received the letter informing her that she was fired – a move which despite 14 years working in the Diocese means she is now barred from working in any other schools in the area.

The letter from the Diocese explained that Charlesworth was being fired because of her husband’s ‘twenty-plus year history of violence, abuse, and harassment of people - mostly women.’

‘We know from the most recent incident involving you and Mrs. Wright (the principal) while you were still physically at Holy Trinity School, that the temporary restraining order in effect were not a deterrent to him,’ stated the letter.‘Although we understand he is current incarcerated, we have no way of knowing how long or short a time he will actually serve and we understand from court files that he may be released as early as next fall.

In a letter from the Diocese who runs Holy Trinity School, Charlesworth was informed that she and her four kids were barred because her ex-husband was 'too dangerous'

The school, meanwhile, maintains it took the correct course of action.

'If Mrs. Charlesworth were to continue at the school, the possibility of harm and violence to her and others was much greater than if she did not,' Tom Beecher, director of the diocese’s Office for Schools, said in the undated letter.

'We couldn’t possibly jeopardize innocent children to justify her return.

Ms. Charlesworth had obtained a temporary restraining order against her husband and was extrememly concerned that he might come after her following years of verbal and emotional abuse.

The new legislation covers the victims of stalking and sexual assault and requires employers to take reasonable steps to protect the workers, such as changing the workplace phone number, relocating the desk and implementing a safety plan.

Ms. Charlesworth said after she was fired that keeping silent would have put co-workers and children attending the school at even greater risk because no one would have known of the danger.

'As a parent, I get their concerns. I do have four children. Every time we step out the door, there is that fear of the unknown. In today’s world, it is more dangerous to have an unknown threat than it is to have a known threat,' she said.

In early September Charlesworth filed a lawsuit against the diocese, contending the church violated canon law by firing her.

The diocese issued a statement defending its actions: 'We are confident that when the court is able to review the decision, the protection and safety of children will be understood as the only path the school could have taken.'

Ms. Charlesworth is now studying to be a nurse and her four children attend public school.
