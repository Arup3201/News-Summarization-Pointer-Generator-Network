He's trained to fly Apache helicopters and has served two tours of service in Afghanistan.

But Prince Harry has now been pictured preparing for his next challenge - leading a group of four wounded servicemen on a 208-mile trek across the Antarctic in -45C.

The royal, 28, is pictured alongside actor Dominic West taking the lead on a recent training expedition on the Langjökull Glacier - meaning 'Long Glacier - in Iceland at the end of July.

Grueling: Prince Harry can be seen leading his UK team, who will take part in the Walking With Wounded challenge, along with actor Dominic West (pictured third right) on a ten-hour trek across a glacier in Iceland

Difficult: The men had to lug huge backs holding their tent and food supplies across the glacier - Iceland's second largest

It involved a challenging ten hour trek on skis to cross 33km of the glacier - Iceland's second largest.

The prince was joined by members of his UK South Pole team Glenfiddich and West, 43, star of The Wire, who will head a rival Commonwealth team in the Walking With The Wounded charity event in November.

Conditions were variable, from slushy wet snow for the first couple of days to stunning clear conditions with hard crispy snow underfoot for the final day.

Each evening the team was met with sleet which froze quickly to goggles making visibility difficult, reminding everyone of the challenges and frustrations they must overcome in this environment.

Trying to dry off wet gloves, jackets and trousers becomes a task in itself and something that should be easier in the South – it hasn’t rained in areas of the Antarctic for two million years.

The Prince will lead Duncan Slater, who is a double below the knee amputee after his vehicle hit an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in Afghanistan; Ibrar Ali who had his arm amputated after a roadside bomb explosion in Iraq; Kate Philp who had one leg amputated below the knee after her armoured vehicle was hit by an IED in Afghanistan and Guy Disney who had a leg amputated below the knee after coming under fire while on patrolin Afghanistan.

Dominic West will join a team of Commonwealth troops and U.S. servicemen will make up a third crew.

Challenging: The ten-hour expedition across the Langjökull Glacier - meaning 'Long Glacier - in Iceland at the end of July is in preparation for a 208-mile trek across the Antarctic in November

Hard work: The team had to march through wet snow and sleet - making it difficult to dry off equipment

Prince Harry is now in Angola on a visit for the 25th anniversary appeal of a mine clearance charity which was championed by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.

The Prince is working on behalf of the HALO Trust, his spokesman said.

His late mother was passionate about its work in trying to rid mines and unexploded devices from war-torn lands.

His spokesman said: 'Prince Harry, as patron of the HALO Trust's 25th Anniversary Appeal, is currently on a private visit to Angola to see HALO's mine clearance and will be touring minefields and meeting beneficiaries of HALO's work'.

The late Princess Diana visited minefields being cleared by HALO in Angola just before her death in 1997 to help draw world attention to the horror of landmines. 

Duncan Slater, who has had both his legs amputated below the knee after his vehicle hit an IED in Afghanistan, can be seen removing one of his prosthetic leg during the trek

The HALO Trust works with some of the world's most vulnerable people so they can plant their crops, rebuild their homes and raise their families in safety once the mines have been cleared.

Prince Harry has already visited minefields in Tete province in Mozambique in 2010 as part of his work with the project. He met amputees, seeing for himself the devastating impact that landmines have on some of the poorest people in mine-affected communities.

During his trip to Mozambique he spent time with a team of HALO deminers. Under supervision, Prince Harry detonated several mines.

He will then go on safari in Botswana with girlfriend Cressida Bonas, 24.
