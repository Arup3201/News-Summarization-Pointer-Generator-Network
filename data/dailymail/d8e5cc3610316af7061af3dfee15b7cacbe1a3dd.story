Billion dollar girl: Ekaterina Rybolovleva has bought Skorpios from the Onassis family

The daughter of a Russian billionaire has been unveiled as the buyer of the Greek island where shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis married Jackie Kennedy.

Ekaterina Rybolovleva, daughter of business magnate Dmitry Rybolovlev, has bought Skorpios, her father's investment office confirmed today.

The 24-year-old purchased the island  in the Ionian Sea, west of Greece, from Onassis' sole surviving heir, granddaughter Athina Onassis Roussel, 28, for a reported £100million.

‘Ekaterina is delighted that the 
trust has negotiated this purchase,’ a representative of Rybolovlev's 
family investment office said, confirming she also acquired the neighbouring island of Sparti.

‘She regards the acquisition as a long-term financial investment.’

Miss Rybolovleva's father Dmitry,  co-founder of the Russian potash producer Uralkali, has a history of snapping up trophy properties and is the owner of the AS Monaco Football Club.

The
 island of Skorpios was bought by Onassis in 1962, believed to have cost
 just 3.5 million drachmas, the equivalent of about £10,000.

Six
 years later it hosted his wedding to Jacqueline Kennedy, the widow of 
the late President John F Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963.

After
 his death Skorpios passed to his daughter Christina, who died of a 
heart attack aged 37 in 1988, and then to Athina, the Daily Telegraph 
reports.

According to 
Greek press the contracts for the purchase of the private island are 
being drawn up by law firms in Athens and Geneva.

Farhad Vladi, whose company, Vladi 
Private Islands, has hundreds of islands on its books, told the paper 
that while he had not heard of the deal, it was possible Ms Onassis Roussel had decided to sell the island.

He said: 'These
 Russian oligarchs have billions, so it may be that one of them came 
along and said "I will give you 100 million or 200 million euros for 
it". Anything is possible.'

Mr Vladi said he was asked by Ms Onassis Roussel to carry out an evaluation of the island eight years ago.

It is believed she has little 
interest in spending time on the island, or in Greece.

He
 said the water comes from a mountain bought by Aristotle Onassis on a 
nearby island, and that anyone who bought the island would need to buy 
the mountain also, which he estimated would cost upwards of 100 million 
euros.

The mayor of the 
nearby island of 
Meganisi, Efstathios Zavitsanos, said the deal was likely to be a 
long-term lease since Aristotle Onassis's will stated that Skorpios
 could not be sold or leave the family.

‘We have lived with the Onassis 
legend and it will never fade,’ he said. ‘You see, Aristotle was close 
to the local society, the fishermen and the residents. He was not just a
 rich man, he was truly loved.’

Like father, like daughter: Ekaterina, 24, is the daughter of Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev who owns AS Monaco Football Club

The island hosted many parties during 
the time of Aristotle Onassis, who is buried there, as is his daughter 
and his son, Alexander, who died in a plane crash in 1973.  

It is also home to three residences, a helicopter landing pad and a boat quay.

Swiss-educated Ms Onassis Roussel is the only surviving descendant of the shipping magnate.

Ms Onassis Roussel was born in France, and is the only child of Christina Onassis and her fourth husband, Thierry Roussel.

She is married to Brazilian Olympic show jumper, Alvaro de Miranda Neto, and lives in Sao Paulo.

In
 the past there have been rumours that Giorgio Armani, Bill Gates, the 
founder of Microsoft, and Madonna were interested in buying the tiny 
island.
