A council has come under fire after placing fines on gravestones because mourners' floral tributes breached regulations on pot plants.

Several visitors to Alfreton Cemetery in Derbyshire found letters from Amber Valley Borough Council stating they had to pay for a garden permit because they had placed more than one pot plant at a gravestone.

Rebecca Day, 37, was tending to her grandmother's grave when she discovered the A5 sized notice, which said she must pay £87 because she had more than the one pot plant allowed under council regulations.

Mrs Day, from Alfreton, Derbyshire, said: 'I can't stop crying. I felt sick. It's a special place and I feel it has been violated.

'I was so upset when I came across and found it on there. She lived in Alfreton all her life. I'm very angry - it's disgusting.

'I don't want it to look just like a bit of grass in a field. I shouldn't have to pay to keep it looking nice. Not everybody can afford to pay.

'The only thing we are allowed by the council, unless you pay £87 pounds, is a headstone and one pot plant.

'We already pay a fortune for the plot - I paid more than £700. Why should we have to pay again just for keeping it as a nice memorial?'

The mother-of-two, whose grandmother Rhoda Vardy passed away in 2011 at the age of 79 following kidney problems, added: 'She would have been 81 today.

'I just think it is wrong. I don't think there is any need. We've put our own topsoil on there. What is wrong with the graves looking like that? There's a lot of us that are quite angry. 

'The council needs to be a little more thoughtful to us paying our respects. It's just a job to them but it's not to us.

'People to come and remember people. We are trying to make it a nice place where people want to come and visit.

'It takes time and it takes money that people won't have.'

Emma Townsend, 33, was forced to pay 
an £87 charge to place more than one pot plant at the grave of her seven-year-old daughter, who died from a
brain tumour in 2010.

Mrs Townsend, from South Normanton, 
Derbyshire, said: 'I arrived to see my daughters grave and from the car 
could see something had been left on the stone.

'I presumed it would be something 
nice but as I walked over I saw it was a notice telling me the grave did
not comply with cemetery rules.

Charge: Ms Day will have to pay the council £87 for permission to have more than one plant at her grandmother's grave at a time

'I was completely devastated. Whoever put it there surely still has humanity. They could see my daughters face in the tributes.'

Several mourners with family members buried at the cemetery are setting up a petition to call on the council to scrap the charge, which is enforced when families want to plant flowers and shrubs on graves. The fines started appearing on the graves last month.

Simon Gladwin, assistant director of landscaping services at Amber Valley Borough Council, said plots at Alfreton cemetery cost £525, with garden permits costing £52 or £87 depending on the plot size.

He added: 'The fee is levied as when someone puts a garden it makes it more difficult for the area to be maintained, and it increases the council's maintenance costs so it is a one off fee that we charge.

'You can't simply mow up and down rows when there are gardens there.

'The notice is relatively discreet. It is only an A5 notice saying the garden does not comply with standards and to call the officer to discuss it further.'

Justified: Amber Valley Borough Council said the charge is necessary because plant pots make maintenance more difficult and raise the costs
