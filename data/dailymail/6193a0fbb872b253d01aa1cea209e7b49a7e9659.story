Sir Bradley Wiggins has revealed he will remain at Team Sky next season in order to target Paris-Roubaix and the Hour Record, but said he does not expect to return to the Tour de France.

With his contract up at the end of the season, Wiggins' future has been the subject of much speculation since Sky team principal Sir Dave Brailsford chose to leave the 2012 Tour winner out of the squad for this year's race - a decision brought under renewed focus when the defending champion Chris Froome was forced to withdraw on stage five.

But in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport at a sponsor's event in Italy, Wiggins said he planned to sign a new deal with Sky.

'It's true, I'm thinking about it (the Hour Record),' Wiggins said. 'Not this year but I'll try next year. And I'll do it on these bikes because I'm going to stay at Sky.

'My time as a Grand Tour rider is over. I'll still ride them but not to win them. I'll sign up now for this event next year. If Sky doesn't take me to the Tour, I'll be back.'

It has been reported that Wiggins will sign a contract until 2016 with Team Sky. He had been linked with a move to either Orica-GreenEdge or Garmin-Sharp if he had moved on.

Wiggins is due to ride for England at the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in July and also told Gazzetta he plans to ride in the Vuelta a Espana - a race which has also been mentioned as a possible comeback for Froome after injury forced to him to quit the Tour, perhaps setting up another edition of the long-standing drama regarding the relationship between the two Tour winners.'
