It was the proudest moment of Tom Cleverley's career and he understandably didn't want to say a word out of turn.

Louis van Gaal had just named him captain for Manchester United's tour match against Roma and the midfielder wanted to say something that would resonate with the new boss sat beside him.

'I watched the Netherlands in the World Cup and I think I'm going to be his type of player,' Cleverley asserted, sending out a clear signal of his intent to hold down a starting place this season.

It was a smart remark but the reaction was merciless.

Fresh start: Tom Cleverley was handed the captain's armband by new Man United boss Louis van Gaal for the tour match with Roma on Saturday night

Impress me: Louis van Gaal has stated that he is willing to give even the under-performing members of United's squad the chance to show what they can do

Fall guy: Cleverley was the scapegoat for many of United's poor performances under David Moyes last season

The snippet was posted to the 2.85m followers of United's official Twitter account and immediately met with a torrent of scorn and mockery from fans of all allegiances.

'Tom should be a comedian,' retorted one wag. Others suggested he move to Arsenal, or Scunthorpe United. Most were variations on 'lol' or 'lmao'. Some we can't repeat.

It showed once again how Cleverley's stock has plummeted since Sir Alex Ferguson identified him as a homegrown replacement for Paul Scholes three years ago.

When United visited the States back in 2011, Cleverley ran the midfield against European champions Barcelona and was poised to make a big breakthrough.

Three years on, it seems like he's having to start from square one again.

Low point: Cleverley's performances last season epitomised the failings of the Moyes era in the opinion of many United fans

Cleverley, 24, epitomised the frustrations of the David Moyes era at Old Trafford. Overpowered, technically deficient and apparently unable to create anything, he was an easy scapegoat as United slumped to seventh place in the Barclays Premier League.

He was abysmal when United crashed 2-0 in Greece against Olympiacos in the Champions League last-16 and embarrassingly hooked at half-time during the 3-0 home loss to champions-elect Man City.

He responded to European defeat to Bayern by going out on the town and didn't appear again under the doomed Moyes regime.

Indeed, Cleverley was so consistently sub-par he played himself out of contention for the England World Cup squad.

Accused of a string of 'inept' displays and 'without possessing any genuine qualities whatsoever', he was even targeted by an online petition calling on Roy Hodgson to ban him.

National duty: Cleverley is also highly-regarded by England manager Roy Hodgson, who once likened him to Spain's Cesc Fabregas

But van Gaal is willing to wipe the slate clean and give Cleverley, like every other member of the United squad, a fair chance to stake his claim.

He played 45 minutes of the 7-0 win over the Los Angeles Galaxy and was given 70 minutes in the 3-2 victory over Roma.

Even more encouragingly, the fact van Gaal was willing to toss him the captain's armband against the Serie A side suggests Cleverley, who has been at United since the age of 11, will be given every opportunity to impress.

Van Gaal's type of player is dogged, tactically astute and willing to sacrifice everything for the team's cause.

There are plenty of United fans who doubt Cleverley has any of these attributes, but it's worth remembering that the criticism has come in the last 12 months.

Honour: Cleverley expressed his pride at captaining United, whom he joined at the age of 11, for the first time against Roma

Getting stuck in: Cleverley needs to show all of his battling qualities to win back his place in the United side this season

While graduating from the Old Trafford academy, his spells on loan were a fantastic success.

He helped Leicester City win promotion back to the Championship in 2009, was Watford's Player of the Season the following season, and very good for Wigan in the top flight in 2010-2011.

The following campaign saw him impress for United and capped for England before suffering an injury set-back that checked his progress.

Still, Roy Hodgson believed he could do the same job for England that Cesc Fabregas does for Spain. It hasn't turned out that way yet.

His poor performances last season have now left Cleverley having to prove himself all over again, not only to a new manager but the United faithful as well. He should try and recall some of these noteworthy moments in his early career as he strives to re-establish his reputation.

The competition: Ander Herrera, signed by United this summer, has already impressed on the pre-season tour of the States

Setback: Midfielder Michael Carrick has been ruled out for the next three months with an ankle injury

He will face stiff competition for a place in the United midfield with Ander Herrera arriving from Athletic Bilbao and already looking impressive.

With Michael Carrick ruled out for three months with an ankle injury, further reinforcements could follow and it is well known that van Gaal retains an interest in Roma's Dutch international Kevin Strootman.

Cleverley will feel he's turned over a new leaf but without consistent performances from the off it'll be a false dawn. He knows van Gaal - and the fans - will not tolerate anything less.
