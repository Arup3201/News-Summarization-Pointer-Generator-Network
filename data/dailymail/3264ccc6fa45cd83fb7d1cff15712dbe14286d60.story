Elvis Presley fans 
from around the world made their annual pilgrimage to Graceland on 
Thursday to pay their respects to the rock n' roll icon with a solemn 
candlelight vigil on the 36th anniversary of his death.

Thousands
of Presley fans carried lit candles as they walked silently through the
Mediation Garden at Graceland, Presley's longtime Memphis home. The 
garden is the location of Presley's grave and also is the spot where his
mother, father and grandmother are buried.

Wreaths
of flowers and pictures of Presley encircled the grave, while shadows 
cast by the glowing candles danced along the stone wall surrounding the 
garden. Soft music played in the mild night, as some in the procession 
bowed their heads or cried quietly.

Vigil: Police expect 35,000 people to show up at Graceland for the 36th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death

The King: This year's vigil featured a listening party at Stax Records for the recent release of the three-CD box set 'Elvis at Stax'

Each year,
fans of Presley's music and movies come to Memphis for Elvis Week, the 
weeklong celebration of his life and career. Presley died on Aug. 16, 
1977, of a heart attack after battling prescription drug abuse.

The
vigil is the highlight of Elvis Week, which this year featured a 
listening party at Stax Records for the recent release of the three-CD 
box set 'Elvis at Stax.' Performances by Presley tribute artists and a 
screening of the 'Aloha from Hawaii' television program from January 
1973 are other featured events of the weeklong reunion, which wraps up 
Saturday.

Police estimated 35,000 people would
attend the vigil. Last year, an estimated 75,000 people descended on 
Graceland for the event. Elvis' ex-wife Priscilla Presley and his 
daughter Lisa Marie Presley spoke at last year's event, the first time 
they appeared together at the vigil since it began.

Christine
Jeffords made her fifth trip to Graceland with her husband Jon and 
three other members of a fan club called the Elvis Midwest Mafia, whose 
members are from Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. They wore red 
T-shirts with Presley's image emblazoned on a king of hearts playing 
card on the front.

The back of their shirts 
had a quote that gives one reason why fans have made repeated trips to 
Memphis for Elvis Week and the vigil: 'If you have a friend who is an 
Elvis fan, you have a friend for life.'

'Where
else can you go where you meet people from year to year who have the 
same passion?' said Christine Jeffords, a pre-school teacher from 
Traverse City, Mich.

Jeffords, 52, smiles when
she talks about buying her first Presley 45, 'Let Yourself Go,' which 
she bought as a young teen with money she had saved from babysitting 
jobs. She said the vigil is a way to remember not only his career, but 
also his giving personality and ability to make people happy with his 
music.

'If you were sad or happy or whatever, 
he was such a big part of your life,' Jeffords said. 'I always felt in 
my heart that he was a good person, a beautiful person.'

The
vigil started as an informal gathering the year after his death. It has
blossomed into a major tourist event. Fans begin lining up along the 
outer wall of Graceland about 12 hours before the vigil, and many will 
stay until the early morning hours of the next day.

The
event also has become an international affair and a tribute to the 
Tupelo, Miss., native's worldwide popularity, hosting fans from 
Australia, Brazil, England and Japan and other foreign countries.

'I always felt in my heart that he was a good person, a beautiful person,' 52-year-old Christine Jeffords said of Presley

Miguel
Salinas Caceres, 53, came with other members of a fan club whose 
members are from Chile. Making his first visit to Graceland, Salinas 
Caceres recalled making scrapbooks of newspaper article clippings about 
Presley when he was a teen.

The articles and 
scrapbooks were a way he and his family followed and learned about 
Presley because they could not afford a record player or even the 
records themselves. He said his family used to pay a neighbor who owned a
television so that they could watch Presley movies and other TV 
programs at the neighbors' house.

'For a 
person who is an Elvis fan and has the chance to come to the place he 
lived, it's emotional for me,' said Salinas Caceres, of Santiago, Chile. 'It's hard to believe that I'm here on the street where he walked, the 
street corners where he stood, the restaurants where he ate.'

His
fellow fan club member Rodrigo Gandarillas, a native Chilean who now 
lives in Houston, is on his second visit to Graceland. An Elvis tribute 
artist himself, the 39-year-old Gandarillas said the vigil is a way to 
give thanks for the enjoyment Presley has given him.

'The
thing that impacts me the most about the vigil is the large amount of 
people from different countries, different races and different languages
who understand `the King's' musical message,' Gandarillas said.
