An 11-year-old girl has died from a mystery allergic reaction while on a family vacation to Hawaii.

Paige Warner, from Roseville, California, went swimming with her younger sister Violet during their Thanksgiving trip to Honolulu but after 10 minutes, she complained that her nose was burning.

Her throat started to swell up and she struggled to breathe, her mother, Karin Carpenter, told KTXL.

While Paige had long suffered from food allergies and was sensitive to 'environmental conditions', the family had always been able to get her reactions under control, her mother said.

'This time, I just knew that something was wrong,' Carpenter said.

They called 911.

'She looked at me and said, 'I'm dying. I know I'm going to die because I can see the look on your face',' Carpenter said as she became emotional. 

Paige was rushed to hospital. The reaction caused her lungs to close up and her heart to stop, and staff performed CPR on the girl for an hour, friends explained on a gofundme page.

She was put in a coma and the page expresses hope that she will recover, but she died days later.

Her family is at a loss over what could have killed her, KTXL reported. 

Heartbroken: Paige, pictured with her family, had been swimming in a pool in Honolulu with her young sister Violet, left, over Thanksgiving when her nose started burning and her throat began to close up

Tragic: Her heart stopped and medical staff managed to get it beating again but she slipped into a coma and passed away earlier this month. Her family said they could usually get her allergies under control

Doctors are still not sure what could have caused the reaction but Carpenter has been told that anything from volcanic ash in the area to the temperature of the pool could have contributed.

The gofundmepage has raised more than $28,000 for the family.

On the page, friends and family paid tribute to the little girl, whom they remembered as a talented artist who played in her school band.

Carpenter also thanked people for their generosity.

'I am in complete shock and awe, of this generous outpouring for Paige,' she wrote on the page last week. 'I cannot even begin to express my gratitude for the hundreds of people who have left messages, donations, and prayers for my sweet daughter.

Hope: Paige's mother Karin, pictured, said Violet (left) is now helping her and her husband to heal

'This has devastated and shocked my family in the deepest way imaginable, but we are reminded of the beautiful and giving hearts of our friends, both close to us and friends who we have never met.'

Carpenter said that, as the family struggles with Paige's death, her younger sister Violet is helping them heal. She has insisted that they put up Christmas decorations despite their sadness.

'Violet has been our ray of sunshine, keeping us eating and just taking care of ourselves,' Carpenter said.

They will hold a funeral for their daughter in January.
