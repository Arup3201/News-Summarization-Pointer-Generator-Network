Having to put up with stifling heat on the underground is something commonly moaned about by disgruntled passengers particularly during the summer months.

But commuters on a metro train in St Petersberg, Russia, were afforded an unusual method of air conditioning - when the carriage doors failed to close.

Apparently unaware that the doors had failed, the driver speeds away from the unknown station on St Petersberg's Red Line as normal.

Train is ready to depart: Passengers have got off the train but the doors fail to close before the tain pulls away

Out of order: Those on the train only realise that the doors are broken when the train begins to speed out of the station and into the underground tunnel

But instead of frantically grabbing hold of the railings through fear of being thrown from the stage, the few passengers on the train appear much calmer than that.

A YouTube video posted by one of the passengers shows travellers curiously, and probably foolishly, poking their heads out of the empty doorways to get a closer look at the tunnel walls as they whizz by.

The footage shows a young blonde girl gleefully laughing as a fellow passenger gets up from her seat and heads towards the door.

Her dark hair can be seen blowing in the breeze as she leans against the side of the doorway and cools off.

Foolish: One brave passenger decides to get a closer look at the walls of the tunnel and walks over to peer out of the door

Danger: A second passenger is seen on the film making her way over to the open doors and peaking out at the tunnel

Amused by what she sees, the blonde decides to get a closer look herself and tentatively pokes her head out into the pitch dark tunnel.

Next its the cameraman's turn as he decides to take a look and films close to the tangle of high voltage wires that line the tunnel walls.

But one female passenger spots the obvious danger in what her fellow travellers are doing and is seen forcefully dragging her companion back to his seat when he gets up to get a better look.

One YouTube user smartly commented that the doors weren't broken at all but that the air conditioning had stopped working.

Trains on the Metro line can travel of speeds of more than 40 mph.
