Dwayne Stovall wants Texans to know that U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell 'looks and fights like a turtle,' and he hopes that image will bleed over to Republican Sen. John Cornyn â€“ the man whose job he wants.

'We Texans don't need a Beltway turtle telling us how to fight,' Stovall says in his newest video ad.

The slight is related to what Stovall sees as a lack of action from Cornyn, the state's senior senator and the Senate Minority Whip, to block elements of the Affordable Care Act.

Ted Cruz, the junior senator, won national attention in September for monopolizing the Senate floor for 21 hours in a quasi-filibuster aimed at forcing changes to the Obamacare law as a condition of avoiding a government shutdown.

Mitch McConnell 'looks and fights like a turtle,' Stovall says in his ad, hammering his opponent Sen. John Cornyn for working with the Minority Leader from Kentucky

'We Texans don't need a Beltway turtle telling us how to fight,' the tea party-backed candidate says, deadpanning for the camera

'This past summer,' Stovall said in his first radio ad, 'one of our senators fought hard for us to keep Washington from ruining our health care system, and one of them didn't fight for us at all.'

'I'm worried, and I'm mad about that,' the tea party darling continued.

Stovall will compete against Cornyn and a handful of other Senate hopefuls, including Congressman Steve Stockman, in a March 4 Republican primary. If Cornyn should capture 50 per cent of the vote, he'll be the GOP nominee to keep his seat.

Otherwise, the top two Republicans will have to meet in a runoff on May 27.

Brett Rogers, his spokesman, told MailOnline that Stovall's stock is high since he 'has won ten out of ten straw polls' in Texas.

'I like Turtle soup,' says Stovall's golden retriever, Major, in a voiceover -- and you can't even see the pooch's lips move

Cornyn (R) met King Abdullah II or Jordan on Feb. 12, accompanied by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid (L) and the allegedly testudinal McConnell (2nd R)

Stovall's comparison of Sen. McConnell to a shell-covered slowpoke isn't new: The Daily Caller popularized the idea in 2011.

Rogers playfully told MailOnline that Stovall's golden retriever, Major, made the turtle identification on his own. He 'pointed to the TV when Mitch was on, just like when Dwayne takes him hunting,' said Rogers.

'The resemblance was obvious.'

In the Stovall ad, a comic voiceover has Major saying, 'I like turtle soup!'

The risk of offending the Senate's top Republican is a serious one: If Stovall were to upset Cornyn in March or May, and then go on to win the general election against a Democratic candidate, he would enter the Senate with a party leader who might retaliate by relegating him to less-than-impressive committees.

But Rogers insisted it's no big deal.

'I think it's more important that Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid pray that Dwayne Stovall doesn't get to the Senate,' he said, 'because no matter what assignments he's given he will fight like you've never seen against bigger government and more debt.'

'And besides, Matt Bevin is going to wipe the floor with Mitch McConnell,' he added, referring to McConnell's own primary fight in Kentucky.

Cornyn's and McConnell's offices did not respond to a request for comment.
