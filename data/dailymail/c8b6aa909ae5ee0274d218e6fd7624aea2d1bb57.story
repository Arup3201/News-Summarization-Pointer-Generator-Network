Most of us reserve fancy dress for a themed birthday party or Halloween.

But British adults are embracing ‘Cosplay’ – dressing up as their favourite superhero characters from film, comics and gaming.

London Comic Con takes place in May and London Super Comic Convention in March are both held at the Excel Centre at Royal Victoria Dock.

This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby chat to their British guests about their love of 'Cosplay' - dressing up as superheros or gaming characters

Guests (from man going clockwise) Ryan Cooper, Phillipa Dickinson, Lesley Jagger and Lauren Stables discuss their love of 'Cosplay' on This Morning

Men and women across the country, many of whom have traditional 9-5 office jobs ditch their suits, ties and pencil skirts behind on the weekend, favouring facepaint, latex and armour.

Over the weekend they attend conventions with like-minded Cosplay fans.

Lauren Stables, Lesley Jagger, Phillipa Dickinson and Ryan appeared – in full costume gear - on This Morning to talk about their love of superhero role playing.

‘Cosplay is a grat big fancy dress party that everybody is invited to,’ said Lauren, who sat on the famous purple sofa dressed as Judge Cassandra Anderson from the Judge Dredd comic book.

Lauren Stables, pictured here, says she loves the Cosplay experience and often gets fans asked to 'beat them up and arrest them'

Wearing a shiny black costume with 
huge gold armour-style shoulder pads and holding a helmet, she said: ‘Generally when you dress up it’s just 
your spouse who comments on it but having hundreds of people at a 
convention complimenting you is a huge confidence boost.

‘People ask me to arrest them and even beat them up!’

Lesley Jagger was dressed as Samus Aran, a Nintendo video game heroine.

‘It’s really nice having people coming up to you,’ she agreed.

‘Cosplay is welcoming and accepting of anyone, no matter what size or shape you are.’

Lesley was encouraged to participate after friend Phillipa helped her make her costume.

Philipa, who went to her first convention at 15, said it was an ‘amazing experience.’

She
 stood behind the sofa dressed as video game character Hircine, wearing a
 studded metal and fur body suit and holding a toy axe.

When This Morning presenter Phillip 
Schofield suggested Hircine was a man, Phillipa laughed that the 
character was actually ‘genderless,’ but it wouldn’t be appropriate to 
wear just a loin cloth anyway.

‘There are rules,’ she said. ‘The most little you can wear is a bikini.

The Excel Centre at Royal Victoria Dock, London hosts two major conventions a year, pictured here, with guest fans play-fighting

‘You can’t have too much on show and nothing too kinky.’

Fans are encouraged to make their own costumes, though all the guests agreed that shop-bought costumes are just as welcome.

‘It doesn’t matter whether you make your costumes or not, or whether you even know characters,’ said Lauren.

‘It’s just about having fun and taking part.’

That said, many enthusiasts get so involved they spent up to thousands of pounds and hours of their time making costumes.

Ryan, a sheet metal worker, utilised his job skills to create his Dovahkiin costume, made of paper hardened with resin.

‘Everyone should give it a try,’ he said.

Dovahkiin - ‘Dragonborn’ in the tongue of the Dragons - a mortal hero with the ability to use the magic of the dragons, and the protagonist of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim game.

And Philipa said that she often is in the same spot for two hours with fans endlessly approaching her for photos with them.

‘I love making my own costumes and my Mum always helps dress me,’ she said.

The downside of Cosplay? ‘Postcon blues.’

The term means spending the weekend dressed elaborately and being flooded with praise and attention, only to go to work on Monday in ‘normal’ clothing where no one gives you a second look.

Cosplay Conventions are huge in America, with events such as Comic Con in San Diego attracting thousands of enthusiastic attendees every year.
