Eden Hazard has dismissed speculation linking him with a move to Real Madrid, insisting Chelsea is the 'only club that makes him dream'.

Reports coming out of Spain last week suggested that the Champions League winners were willing to offload Gareth Bale to raise the funds to take Hazard to the Bernabeu.

But the Belgium international, who has played a starring role for Chelsea during their unbeaten start to the season, has no intention of quitting Jose Mourinho's side in favour of a switch to the Spanish capital.

'I never said that if I left Chelsea it will only be for Real Madrid. The only club that makes me dream is Chelsea,' Hazard told Canal+.

'I made the choice to join Chelsea because I knew I was going to play. This is my third year here. I don’t know if I'm the main asset of the team, but I can take pleasure by playing in this team. 

'I have no nostalgia when I watch Ligue 1, I think about the future not the past.

'Paris [Saint-Germain] have huge players, but Chelsea have more experience and more players in certain positions. And we also have a better experience in the Champions League.'
