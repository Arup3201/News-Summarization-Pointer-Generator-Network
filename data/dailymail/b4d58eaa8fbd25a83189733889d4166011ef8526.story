Forget how many years you’ve clocked up — experts say what really matters when it comes to how good you look and feel is your ‘biological age’.

This is the physiological age of the internal systems that keep your body functioning healthily and looking good — from your kidneys, brain and nervous tissue through to your skin.

One of the best markers of this is the level of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) in your body.

AGEs are harmful compounds that are formed by glycation: a chemical reaction that happens naturally as we age, but can be accelerated by poor lifestyle choices.

How healthy are you?: If you are guilty of not getting enough exercise, smoking, having high stress levels, a poor diet and not getting enough sleep, you could have a biological age that is much higher than your real one as you may have damaged your internal systems

These AGEs trigger an inflammatory response, causing tissue damage and premature ageing, as well as contributing to the development of age-related diseases such as diabetes, vision impairment, heart disease and kidney damage.

As we revealed in our definitive sugar series with Brooke Alpert earlier this year, your dietary intake of sugar affects the speed at which glycation happens — and therefore the rate at which AGEs are produced. The more sugar you consume, the more AGEs are generated. But it’s not only sugar that takes its toll.

Dr Nessar Ahmed, reader in clinical biochemistry at the School Of Healthcare Science at Manchester Metropolitan University, explains: ‘Foods cooked at high temperatures with direct heat, such as grilling and frying, where caramelisation occurs, increase the production of AGEs.’

Other contributing factors include lack of exercise, smoking, high stress levels, poor diet and not getting enough sleep.

Previously, the only means of measuring your AGEs was through an invasive skin biopsy. But a new, clinically proven scanner called TruAge can measure the levels in your skin — a good indicator of the level of AGEs throughout the rest of your body — in 20 seconds, to give an instant picture of your inner state of health. The higher your level, the ‘older’ you are — both inside and out.

We asked three women to discover their inner age, before Melinda Lane, an expert from Morinda, the company behind the scanner, analysed their surprising results . . .

Gemma Carey, a freelance fashion assistant, lives in Finsbury Park, London.  Real age, 19. Inner age, 44

Gemma Carey: Real age 19, inner age 44. Her love for chocolate and steak and no time to go to the gym has seen her rise from a size ten to a size 12

I left my parents’ home in Bristol last October and moved in with a friend in London. Most nights I’ll have a stir-fry or make burgers or fry chicken with oven chips. I eat out once a week: my favourite meal is steak and chips. I don’t eat breakfast, but I have a cereal bar later in the morning and a tuna sandwich with crisps for lunch. I love fruit and vegetables, and get my five a day.

My big weakness is chocolate, especially Galaxy bars, and I can eat up to three a week. I drink quite a lot of juice, too, particularly orange juice and Ribena.

I used to be a size ten, but now I’m a size 12. A lot of this is due to stress — I’ve just left my previous job and looking for new work is tough. I feel insecure and everything is up in the air.

When I lived in Bristol, I used to go to the gym three times a week, but I’ve been too busy and feel very sluggish as a result.

MELINDA’S VERDICT: Gemma’s score is quite bad, but this is often the case with young people when they’re living fast and not thinking much about the consequences.

She has plenty of time to get her diet right and balance her AGE levels out. She eats a lot of fried, seared food, so even baking or steaming some of her evening meals would help.

The higher the temperature food is cooked at, the more chemical reactions between sugar and protein will occur, forming more AGEs. Swapping juice for water would be good, too: juice has a high sugar content, and sugar is the enemy.

It’s also thought high stress levels can contribute to a spike in AGEs as when we are anxious our blood sugar levels can rise, speeding up the glycation process.

Suzanne Seddon, an acting teacher and scriptwriter, lives in Islington, London, with daughter Poppy-Willow, eight.  Real age, 45. Inner age, 57

Susanne Seddon: Real age 45, inner age 57. Although she is a smoker who has the odd glass of wine, Susanne has recently started eating healthier

I’ve smoked 20 cigarettes a day for more than 20 years. I’ve tried to stop several times and once managed it for nine months, but I can’t seem to kick the habit for good.

I love a glass of wine with my evening meal and find it’s a great way to relax after a hard day. I drink more at weekends when I’m with friends — maybe up to half a bottle of wine in one evening.

Otherwise, I’m quite health-conscious. I’ve been trying to lose weight as I was getting heavier round the middle and had put on nearly two stone over the past year, going from a dress size 12 to 14.

I’ve been cutting back on carbohydrates and eating low-fat versions of everything from yogurt to soup. In the evenings, I’ll try to cook a healthy meal for me and my daughter: a roast chicken with buttered cabbage, or fish with potato and green beans. Poppy-Willow and I go swimming once a week and I walk my dog, Leo, three times a day, too.

On the downside, I’m a sun-worshipper, and I was a flight attendant for eight years on the Caribbean-American routes, so my skin has been damaged and I’m more wrinkled and dry as a result, with age spots and pigmentation.

MELINDA’S VERDICT: The main contributing factors to Suzanne’s high score are the amount she smokes and drinks.

Cigarette smoke contains a substance called nornicotine (derived from nicotine), which is inhaled into the lungs and passes into the blood stream. Nornicotine reacts with proteins in the body to produce AGEs, and studies have found smokers have far higher levels than non-smokers.

It would be ideal if she could stop smoking completely, but even cutting the smoking and drinking by half could improve her looks and health in weeks.

Vanessa Powell, a receptionist, has two daughters, Jessica, ten, and Violet, eight. She lives with husband Stacy in Coulsdon, Surrey. Real age, 44. Inner age, 41

Vanessa Powell: Real age 44, inner age 41. After noticing how much wine her husband and her were consuming, Vanessa has cut back and started exercising several times a week

Towards the end of last year, my husband and I were getting through a whole bottle of wine a night. It was our way of winding down after a stressful day. I work six days a week, from 8.30am to 2pm, and during the week I’d be rushing from one after-school club to another with the girls.

By the time I’d got home and prepared a quick meal, I was exhausted. Dinner-wise, I’m a fan of anything quick — pasta with sauce or ready meals I can pop in the oven, and I’ll steam some vegetables to go with my meal.

I noticed I’ve been getting fatter, so last month I gave up alcohol and started exercising. I go swimming once a week, and I do a legs, bums and tums class, too.

I eat three meals a day, with cereal for breakfast, and a sandwich or cup of soup for lunch. I definitely feel and look better than I did four weeks ago.

MELINDA’S VERDICT: Vanessa has done really well. To lower her AGE levels further she needs to cut back on processed food and try to cook a proper meal at least a couple of nights a week. Her new-found abstinence will have reduced her AGE level, as well. Alcohol contains large amounts of sugar.

The exercise will have helped, too, as it burns up excess sugar in the body for fuel, so lowering blood sugar and, therefore, AGE levels.
