Jimmy Bullard has slammed ITV for editing him into a bully during his time in I'm a Celebrity 2014.

Speaking about the 'banter' with fellow contestant Jake Quickenden after Bullard's exit from the jungle, the former Wigan midfielder said: 'I've seen that [footage] back and it was totally tongue in cheek. The way that came across on TV was totally not how it came across in camp.

'The best person to answer that is Jake. We're great friends and we're going to be for a long time. It was total banter.

He added: 'Let me tell you, he gave as good as he took. Saying that, I can be a bit of a nightmare.

Bullard also says that because viewers only saw a short amount of time on a daily basis, they didn't see how playful they were with each other in the jungle. 

'I can see how it can come across as harsh for the punters to watch – but in our little bubble it was just banter,' he added.

When asked why he think he was evicted first, Bullard admitted: 'I haven't got a clue why I've gone, I've seen some clips and have seen how different it can show you.

The ex-footballer said Jake Quickenden was just as rude with his banter on the show but viewers didn't see it

'When you are in there 24/7 it's so different and it's something you can't affect. Obviously I wasn't voted for enough.'

Despite being voted out first, Jimmy still says that he loved being on the show.

'What an experience! I'm so glad that I came here and did the show,' the ex-footballer said. 'It was mad. I was in there with a great bunch, but that's exactly what you wish for. 

'To be fair, they were a mad bunch – but I loved everything about it. In a way, it's lovely to be out. I was loving it in there and I wanted to stay a little longer, but I'm out and that's it.'

Bullard hopes he's made long-lasting friendships with Carl 'Foggy' Fogarty and Quickenden

But saying goodbye to Carl 'Foggy' Fogarty was tough for the former sportsman. 

'Watching Foggy on screen crying make me nearly cry. You bond in there. Spending time with 24/7 with someone is like spending a couple of years with someone,' Jimmy said.

'When he broke down, I was like, 'Ah Fog, don't do this to me on TV.' I totally went. He's a great friend and along with Jake, I know I've got two friends for life. But I was close to them all. I couldn't have asked for a better bunch.' 

Bullard was forced to retire from football at the age of 29 following a series of injuries
