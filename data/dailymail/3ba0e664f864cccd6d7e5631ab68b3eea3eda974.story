It was the pride of the Sunderland shipyards before being used to save Soviet civilians from the German onslaught during the Second World War - but now this cargo vessel lies rusting at the bottom of the Black Sea.

The Bryansk, a 100-metre-long ship used by the Soviet navy before being sunk by the Nazis, has sat on the Odessa Bay seabed, near Ukraine's southern coast, for 73 years.

Now a diver and underwater photographer has captured a series of stunning images of the 116-year-old steam ship's rusting hulk - which has now been home to the Bay's jellyfish and rays for far longer than it was ever in service.

History: The cargo was built in Sunderland by shipmakers Short Brothers Limited in 1898, and original flew the British flag as the Minterne. It was renamed several times over the coming years, including to the Inocencio Figaredo in 1920 - the name under which it was sailing when this photograph was taken

The steam-powered ship was built in Sunderland by shipmakers Short Brothers Limited in 1898, and flew the British flag under its original name the Minterne.

It 
was renamed the Nancy Lee in 1903, the Grelford in 1916, the Holms 
Island in 1917, the Olvaarriaga in 1919, the Inocencio Figaredo in 1920 
and finally the Bryansk in 1938 - having earlier left service in Britain to join the navy of the Soviet Union.

In 1941, Romanian and German troops besieged the Soviet city of Odessa, and the Bryansk was used to transport wounded people and valuable equipment across the Black Sea to Sevastopol

Life: Although the ship was built in 1898, it has been underwater since 1941 - meaning it has been home to jellyfish (pictured) for longer than it was ever in service

Awe: Underwater photographer Andrey Nekrasov, 42, recently visited the wreck, which is in a part of the Black Sea popular with divers. 'When I dived into the hold the change from outside the ship was so striking that I forgot to breathe,' he said

Facing a Luftwaffe attack on August 21nd 
1941, the ship's captain K.S. Gorenko tried evasive manoeuvres but the 
ship sustained serious damage and it sunk to the bottom of the Black Sea along with its crew of 30 to 45 people.

The ship had only managed to last 13 days into the 73-day Nazi siege on the now-Ukrainian city, and all that is left of it underwater today is its hull.

'When
 I dived into the hold the change from outside the ship was so striking 
that I forgot to breathe... In contrast to the outside, where water 
clarity so poor that visibility was just 3 metres, inside the hold it 
was 15 metres. This meant I could see everything very clearly,' he said.

'The
 entrance to the hold looked like a luminous emerald rectangle. Iron 
bars and their supports had managed to resist eroding over time. As a 
result, the hold reminded me of the interior of a Gothic cathedral, as 
rays of light made their way through the space,' Mr Nekrasov added.

'It
 was silent and I almost experienced some kind of religious feeling, as 
if I was in an underwater temple,' he went on to say.

Like many battles of the Eastern Front, the siege of Odessa exacted a heavy toll on troops and civilians.

Another
 ship involved in the evacuation of Odessa, the Lenin, was torpedoed by a
 German submarine near the Crimean coast, leaving 2,000 dead.
