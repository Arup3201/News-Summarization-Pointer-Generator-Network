Seven internet service providers have launched legal action against GCHQ after accusing it of illegally accessing 'potentially millions of people’s private communications'.

Britain’s intelligence centre has been accused of carrying out 'targeted operations against internet service providers to conduct mass and intrusive surveillance.'

The complaint has been filed at a London 
court by ISPs Riseup and May First/People Link of the US, GreenNet of 
Britain, Greenhost of the Netherlands, Mango of Zimbabwe, Jinbonet of 
South Korea and the Chaos Computer Club of Germany, plus campaigners 
Privacy International.

The Government Communications HQ (GCHQ) has been accused of carrying out 'targeted operations against internet service providers to conduct mass and intrusive surveillance'

The revelation comes after leaks by fugitive NSA worker Edward Snowden showed GCHQ was a key player in covert US surveillance operations globally.

It also comes after German magazine Der Speigel ran a series of reports in which they claimed to detail GCHQ’s 'illicit activities'.

They include allegedly targeting a Belgian telecommunications company, Belgacom.

The report claims staff computers were infected with malware in a 'quantum insert' attack to secure access to customers.

The legal complaint says this was 'not an isolated attack' and alleges violations of Britain’s Human Rights Act and the European Convention of Human Rights.

'These widespread attacks on providers and collectives undermine the trust we all place on the internet and greatly endangers the world’s most powerful tool for democracy and free expression,' said Eric King, Privacy International’s deputy director.

Britain’s Foreign Office did not immediately comment.

GCHQ, which stands for Government Communications Headquarters, employs around 5,500 people and is housed in a giant doughnut-shaped building in the sleepy town of Cheltenham, southwest England.

Snowden’s leaks claimed that the NSA had been secretly funding GCHQ to the tune of £100 million ($160 million, 120 million euros) over the last three years.
