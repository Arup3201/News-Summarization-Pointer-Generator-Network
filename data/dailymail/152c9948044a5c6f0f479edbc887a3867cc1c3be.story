Football pundit Stan Collymore has revealed that Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown was the toughest defender he ever faced during his playing career.

Before becoming a talkSPORT presenter, Collymore played for a succession of clubs including Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Aston Villa and rates the former Arsenal centre-back as his most feared opponent.

Speaking to the Bleacher Report, Collymore said: 'I always did well against Arsenal, but Keown used to punch, growl and do everything possible to make it hard for you.

'It was before the rule changes back then, and he'd take your legs out from behind, and you'd be on your back the first chance he had in a game.'

While Collymore struggled against Keown, he somehow fared better against one of the Premier League's most revered defensive partnerships.

'My favourite ground has to be Manchester United's Old Traffford. I scored in a victory to end United's year-long unbeaten home record there in the mid-1990s, against the likes of Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister—Sir Alex Ferguson's team at their peak,' he said.

'Bruce and  Pallister were two of the best central defenders Manchester United have had, but I used to score virtually every time we played against them.

'It's a weird one, because they were both exceptional players.'

The 43-year-old also revealed several other interesting facts, including who was the funniest player he has ever encountered.

'Mark Dennis was extremely funny. He once feigned a heart attack at Brighton just because he didn't want to play in the reserves.

'Dean Saunders used to do every voice you could think of—he could do all the impressions.

'Steve Harrison at Villa was also very funny. I remember he stopped our bus at a red light once, and left it there for ages while he went and did some shopping.
