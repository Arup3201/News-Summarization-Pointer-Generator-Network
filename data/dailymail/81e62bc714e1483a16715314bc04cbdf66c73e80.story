Many of us have become so reliant on our smartphones, we use them to carry out a staggering 221 tasks every day.

A study of 2,000 smartphone owners revealed that the average user reaches for their phone at 7:31am each morning, to check personal emails and Facebook.

And before they’ve even got out of bed, the majority of people check the weather, read the news, and send a text or two to friends.

The average user reaches for their phone at 7:31am in the morning, according to new research, and these users typically check personal emails and Facebook before they even get out of bed. Almost four in ten smartphone owners admitted feeling lost without their gadgets

It also emerged that people will check the train times, do their banking and update Instagram early on in the day.

The research was carried out by marketing agency Tecmark.

In an average week, research has discovered that the average user pick ups their phone more than 1,500 times a week.

The average owner uses this device for three hours and sixteen minutes each day - or the equivalent of almost one full day a week. 

Almost four in ten users admitted feeling lost without their gadgets. 

Many owners also confessed to finding themselves using their phone without realising they are doing so, with two thirds saying they have managed to log in and browse Facebook without thinking.

And surprisingly, four in ten said they have, at one time or another, checked their emails automatically without thinking.

The study  also revealed that smartphones are becoming more of a ‘go-to-gadget’, replacing desktops and laptops, which people only turn to for, on average, 140 tasks in a typical day. 

Managing director Richard Heyes said: ‘Smartphones are an easier way to access information and our friends through the Internet.

‘For most of us, it’s now second nature. 

'And certainly we’re not surprised to see this huge reliance on our handheld devices.

'But many people may not realise just how many times a day they check their phone or carry out a simple task on it.’

‘We’re all guilty of picking up our phones and checking the news or work emails when we first wake up - for many it’s how we set ourselves up for the day.

‘It’s so much easier checking your phone for Facebook updates rather than waiting for a desktop or laptop computer to load - we don’t have that much time in the mornings.’

In an average week, the research discovered that users pick up their phone more than 1,500 times to complete various tasks from emails to playing games and posting to social media.

And the average smartphone user is on their phone for three hours and sixteen minutes a day.

This amounts to almost one full day a week using their phone, so it’s no wonder almost four in ten users admitted feeling lost without their gadgets.

But maps are used on both phone and desktop computer equally - four times a day on average for both devices.
