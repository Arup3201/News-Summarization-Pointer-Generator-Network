Police are investigating the mysterious death of a dance instructor whose body was found at her California home just hours after she returned home from a Halloween party.

Mendocino County sheriff's detectives are treating the death of 25-year-old Kayla Grace Chesser, from Willits, as 'suspicious' although there is 'no obvious evidence'.

They have spoken to a man they believe was with Kayla at the time of her death and who was involved in a collision several hours after she died.

The man is believed to have intentionally crashed his vehicle and was airlifted to an out-of-county hospital where he is currently being treated for serious injuries,The Press Democrat reported. 

Captain Greg Van Patten said deputies responded to a call by friends of the woman at around 6am on Saturday morning. 

He declined to give details on the cause of the death, other than to say it was not obvious. An autopsy is due to be carried out later today followed by toxicology tests.

Kayla had been to a Halloween party with friends in Willits that night before returning to the home. It is thought that the man involved in the road collision had been with her during the night.

Dance instructor Kayla was described as 'very talented' and 'just a beam of light. A loving, sweet, kind person'

'We have identified someone that was with her at the time of her death,' Captain Van Patten said. 'He was witnessed at the home just prior to her discovery.'

Kathleen Ferri-Taylor, director at Cloud 9 Studio where Kayla had recently been teaching belly-dancing, described her as 'just a beam of light. A loving, sweet, kind person'.

'She was very talented, just a real beautiful dancer,' she said.
