A student who has fulfilled her dream of a career in the Army officer has also set up a successful fashion company, designing accessories made from upcycled surplus military apparel.

And Emily Núñez, 24, from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, now employs 35 veterans to stitch the high-fashion bags together and has recycled 15,000lbs of material - as well as serving as an intelligence officer.

She got the idea to re-purpose excess materials while she was a senior at Middlebury College in Vermont two years ago, inspired by a talk by
 investor Jacqueline Novogratz about recycling-based businesses.

Along with sister Betsy the pair upcycle shelter halves tents, laundry bags and sleeping bag covers

Emily began to think about what materials around her 
were routinely wasted and could be recycled and turned into something 
powerful, and shared her ideas with her sister Betsy, 26.

They now run fashion firm Sword & Plough, while Emily works as a serving Intelligence Officer with the Group 
Support Battalion in the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort 
Carson, Colorado.

The pair turn tents, laundry bags and sleeping 
bag covers that would otherwise be thrown away or burned into sharp weekend bags, rucksacks and other accessories.

Growing up in a military family Emily followed in her father's footsteps and joined the Army

'It
 has been challenging at times but the two roles complement each other. 
As an officer in the US Army your job is to lead soldiers and to 
motivate them to accomplish a task.

'As the CEO, my job is to ensure that
 we're accomplishing our social mission while keeping the team excited 
about what we're doing,' she tells ABC's digital series Second
 Tour, which profiles the lives of military 
veterans who are doing unique things in the civilian world.

Emily pondered everything that went to waste, shared her ideas with Betsy and they started a business

One of the main goals of her conscious company was to provide meaningful employment for veterans.

They now mainly work with veteran owned, operated and 
staffed manufactures - and they've recycled more than 15,000 lbs of military surplus.

Growing up in a
 military family Emily followed in her father's footsteps and joined the
 Army, but after hearing the talk by Jacqueline Novogratz, founder 
and CEO of Acumen Fund, Emily took note and put her social 
entrepreneur spirit to work.

And sister Betsy had every faith in her ideas.

'When she first told me about her idea I was so 
surprised and happy that she shared that with me,' says Betsy.

'I knew this was 
something that could be very special and could become something really 
unique,' Betsy says. From that conversation the sisters continue to 
build on the idea and business model.

Emily also works as a serving Intelligence Officer at Fort Carson, Colorado

For Emily and Betsy Sword & Plough - a biblical phrase to 'turn swords into
 ploughshares' - means 
re-adapting military technology for a peaceful civilian purpose.

While they never went to school for business and didn't have any 
experience in fashion (their mother Judy put together the first prototype) nothing deterred them from their dream.

'It was a 
challenge to start the business but at the same time it was a huge 
opportunity,' she says.

The
 idea caught on and last year Sword and Plough participated in Mass 
Challenge, the largest startup accelerator and competition in the 
world, and they were awarded £30,000 ($50,000) 
to grow their business.

Sword and Plough items are on sale on their website and they are being sold in Toms Marketplace.

Their bags start from £60, and this style retails at around £130 (r)
