He may not be back to his absolute best yet, but Robin van Persie's recent goalscoring form looks to have boosted his confidence ahead of Manchester United's game with Liverpool.

The Holland striker, who has scored three goals in his last three Premier League games, is beginning to find his form after a slow start to the season, finding the net twice against Southampton despite limited chances.

And Van Persie seems ready to continue his good form against bitter rivals Liverpool on Sunday after enjoying a strenuous training session with his team-mates on Friday morning.

Louis van Gaal had the players attached to ropes to work on their strength, and both Van Persie and strike partner Wayne Rooney seemed to relish the exercise.

United are currently third in the Premier League, seven points ahead of Brendan Rodgers' side who sit ninth, and Van Persie is confident he can help his side keep their good momentum up after five consecutive wins. 

‘I’ve been feeling very well over the last couple of weeks,’ Van Persie told The Sun earlier this week.

‘Physically, I can make my runs over and over again. I had a feeling that it was coming.

‘I can play 90 minutes easy and every time it gets easier. I could keep going in the last minutes and that’s what you want.

'Then the goals, assists, wins will come. I just have to keep it going and play more.

The next game is Liverpool, so we’re looking forward to that. We are really happy that we are on the way up now. We have to keep the momentum going.’
