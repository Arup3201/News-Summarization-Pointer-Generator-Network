Former West Ham and Watford boss Gianfranco Zola has been appointed the new manager of Serie A side Cagliari.

Zola, 48, has previous connections with the club having spent the final two years of his playing career there after a seven-year spell at Chelsea prior to that.

Earlier in the week La Gazzetta dello Sport suggested that the 48-year-old was favourite for the job with the Serie A strugglers and could set to be appointed during the two-week winter break.

Zdenek Zeman has been sacked by Cagliari with the club struggling in Serie A this season

Zola, who played for Cagliari between 2003 and 2005, has not had a job since resigning from Watford in December 2013 following a poor run of form.

Zeman was appointed in July and guided Cagliari to a 4-1 victory over Inter Milan in September, but the Rossoblu have won only one match in 12 subsequent fixtures.

Last Thursday's 3-1 defeat to Juventus proving to be the final nail in Zeman's reign, which left Cagliari languishing three points adrift of safety in 18th place, with no win in their last eight games.
