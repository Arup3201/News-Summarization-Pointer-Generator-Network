We all know Vincent Kompany is one of the best defenders we have seen in the Premier League but, after watching him against Tottenham last week, he needs to make adjustments if he wants to continue his rise to greatness.

When you watch Kompany on TV, he looks awesome and some people might think it is churlish to criticise him. He is strong, fast and agile. He is always quick to the ball and excellent at pinching it off strikers’ toes. He used to be rash and would dive in, which led to some red cards, but to his credit he has cut that out of his game.

Watching at the Etihad, though, I could spot an obvious problem. He is a gambler. Whenever he comes charging out of the back line, he is taking a big risk for the team. The rewards are obvious and when it comes off he looks magnificent. But when it goes wrong, he can be left stranded.

It’s what happened in the first half against Spurs when some of their early movement caused City problems. More than once Kompany came rushing out to try to be first to the ball, only for an opposition player to nick in ahead of him. That left holes at the back and Spurs were able to exploit that.

He reads the first pass into the striker so well but it’s the second phase that becomes difficult. Kompany is one of the fastest defenders around but once he is out of position it’s almost impossible to recover.

David Luiz is the worst example of a defender too keen to press forward. At the World Cup it was like pulling the plug out of the bath — opposition sides would just flood into the holes behind him. You can’t win games at the back but you can lose them.

Kompany is far superior to Luiz but sometimes he would be better off staying put in the back line and waiting for the game to come to him. The players in front of him can go out and attack.

This is not to say Kompany is a bad defender, far from it. He is such a powerful player he could play anywhere on the pitch. That makes it tempting to try to do all those jobs, but sometimes he is fighting too many fires. He ends up covering for his team-mates and tries to do too much.

I do sympathise, though, because when you think of great defenders, you think of partnerships or back fours. With City, you just think of Kompany.

In 10 years at Arsenal I had three major partners: Steve Bould, Tony Adams and Sol Campbell. In seven seasons at City, Kompany has played with Richard Dunne, Micah Richards, Nedum Onuoha, Kolo Toure, Jerome Boateng, Joleon Lescott, Matija Nastasic, Martin Demichelis and now Eliaquim Mangala. That makes it almost impossible to build consistency as a unit.

Kompany is so articulate and already speaks like a future manager so it’s no surprise that he plays in such an emphatic way. He is a fantastic ambassador and part of an excellent core at the club.

For all their lavish spending, City are balancing that with a feeling of respect and there is genuine warmth around the club.

But, if they’re not careful, the league title may suddenly start to slip from their grasp. Kompany is so often the man who tries to make sure that doesn’t happen, but he needs to ensure those rewards are gained by taking slightly fewer risks.
