It should have been the happiest day of their lives.

But a couple's wedding day was turned into a living nightmare when their horse-drawn carriage sped out of control, throwing them and their bridesmaid daughter into oncoming traffic just an hour after tying the knot.

James and Claire Sykes were dumped in the middle of a bypass by the spooked animal and had to be rushed to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, with cuts and bruises to their faces and shoulders.

And in an act of bravery their 
four-year-old daughter Abby-Lei, who was also on board, was 
shielded from injury by her dad.

Battered and bruised: James and Claire Sykes' wedding was ruined when the horse pulling their carriage ran into a lamppost and tipped them into a busy road

The couple had just married at Wakefield Registry Office when the horse ran into a lamppost and chucked them off.

Luckily their nine-month-old twins Lily Grace and Miley Joy were due to be on the carriage with their parents, who changed their mind at the last minute due to bad weather.

Mrs Sykes, 28, was left weeping in the road and hugging her daughter following the ordeal.

'I sank into my husband's chest and started crying, I just wanted to know my little girl was okay,' she said.

'We have both cried thinking about how bad it could have been if the twins were on the carriage too.'

The couple had got onto the carriage, which had been booked for them by Mr Sykes' father, at the Pineapple pub on the A655 Normanton bypass - where they were having pictures taken.

It was due to take them towards their home town.

But Mrs Sykes said the drivers jumped from the carriage when they realised the horse was going too quickly. The horse began bucking and then hit a lamppost, dumping the couple and their daughter into the road.

Mrs Sykes said: 'It all happened so fast. Witnesses told us they saw the horse bucking when it got out of its box so we think there was something wrong from the beginning. It could have been in there for hours.'

The family were furious to discover this week that the carriage operator was not insured, meaning they will receive no compensation.

Mrs Sykes added: 'We will never get our wedding day back, no matter what happens. But with some compensation we could have had a trip away or a new photoshoot which would have made us feel a bit better.'

A police spokeswoman confirmed that officers were called at 11.52am last Saturday to a road traffic collision involving a horse-drawn carriage.
