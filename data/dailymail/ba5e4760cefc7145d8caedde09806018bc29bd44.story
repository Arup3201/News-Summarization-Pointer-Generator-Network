These lovable little owls can't seem to get enough of each other after they were seen snuggling up together on a tree branch.

The owlets, spotted near their burrow in northern Israel, fluffed each others feathers in an affectionate display.

They were captured by Israeli native Vladimir Kogan, who spent weeks waiting for the perfect shot of the young owls.

Mr Kogan, 44, has told of how he waited patiently in the hot sun for the young owls to emerge from their burrows in a remote part of Beit She'an, Israel.

After a few weeks, the owlets became used to his presence, and were soon so unafraid of him that they allowed him to come close enough to take these images.

Mr Kogan said: 'There were seven fledglings all together but these two seemed never seemed to leave each other's side.

'After spending weeks watching the birds you really get to know each of their personalities, these two were especially affectionate.

'It took me a couple of days to organise a good place to shoot from, then I tried placing a tree branch where I thought they might land.

'Luckily, I was rewarded with some great shots.

'The young owls got used to my hide and simply went about their business towards the end.

'This was a great feeling and it meant I could photograph them freely from a distance of only ten metres.

'I grew attached to the little owls but it wasn't long before the time came for them to leave their nest.'
