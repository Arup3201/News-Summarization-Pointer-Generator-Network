They are one of Australia’s most iconic animals and are used to having their photos taken by visitors to their zoo enclosure.

But now the koalas have taken things into their own paws.

Three koalas, named Bruce, Aaron, and Bill, who are residents of the WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo, have snapped pictures of themselves while munching on eucalyptus leaves in their enclosure.

What's this then? A koala takes a close look at the camera perched on a tree in its enclosure at the WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo

The koalas used the Sony QX100, which has a lens on a movable tripod claw, which connects to your mobile phone via Wi-Fi.

A motion sensor lets the camera know when the subject is within range and triggers the camera to take three photos.

This meant the koalas were able to ‘take’ the photos themselves when they moved in front of the lens, which was positioned in one of the trees in their enclosure.

Bruce, Aaron, and Bill showed that they are far from camera-shy. They seemed enchanted by the cameras and pulled cheeky poses in front of them.

‘The majority of WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo visitors either take photos of or with the resident koalas. It was great to do something where the koalas themselves get to own their moment in the spotlight,’ said Kylie Hackshall, Mammal Keeper at WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo.

The Sony QX Lens-Style camera can be mounted on different objects, including a tree, and sends the photos straight to a mobile phone

Wait, what do I press? Since the camera's were operated by motion-sensor, the photos captured all sorts of candid moments
