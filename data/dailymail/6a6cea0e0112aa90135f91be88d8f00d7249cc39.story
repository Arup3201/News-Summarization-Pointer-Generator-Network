Police say a Maryland teenager eating a pot brownie in class panicked when his teacher asked him for a piece of the treat, and that he is now charged for obliging.

Anne Arundel County police said Tuesday that the 17-year-old didn't tell the teacher that the brownie contained marijuana.

She began feeling ill and acting disoriented, and was brought to the nurse's office at Broadneck High School in Annapolis on Monday.

The teacher told police that the student had given her the brownie during third period and that she suspected it contained marijuana.

The student, from nearby Arnold, was charged with juvenile counts of administering a dangerous substance, assault and reckless endangerment.

Police did not release his name, and they say he was released to a guardian.

The school is taking action through its own Code of Conduct separately. 

'Possession and use of drugs can have very, very serious consequences,' schools spokesman Bob Mosier told The Capital Gazette. 'The very thought that a student would give a teacher something laced with drugs is, quite frankly, appalling.'
