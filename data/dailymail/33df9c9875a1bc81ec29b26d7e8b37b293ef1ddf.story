A group of leading musicians has called on Russia's president Vladimir Putin to give a fair hearing to members of a punk band facing prison for performing a ‘legitimate protest’.

The trio, Pussy Riot, face up to seven years behind bars after staging a performance in a Moscow cathedral calling on the Virgin Mary to remove President Putin from power.

In a letter to The Times newspaper, the group of British musicians including Jarvis Cocker, Pete Townshend, Martha Wainwright and Neil Tennant, said that the incident by the band amounted to ‘a minor breach of the peace’.

Requesting the release of the 
three band members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, Yekaterina Samutsevich, 
29, and Maria Alekhina, 24, it states: ‘We are extremely concerned about
 the treatment they have received since their arrest and during their 
trial.’

The backing of British musicians comes after other celebrities including pop star Sting and US rockers the Red Hot Chili Peppers had showed support for their plight.

Reserved for priests: In February the women climbed into a reserved area of the Church of Christ the Saviour and performed a 'punk prayer' against Putin

Punishment doesn't fit crime: The musicians expressed have their opinions that the jail sentence was 'entirely disproportionate' echoing the sentiments of protestors outside the court on July 30

The letter
 continues: ‘Dissent is a right in any democracy and it is entirely 
disproportionate that they face seven years in jail for what we consider
 a preposterous charge of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred”.

‘We are especially concerned about recent reports that food is being withheld from them and that they have appeared in court in a cage.

Visiting the UK: The British pop stars have asked that Russian President Vladimir Putin, visiting the UK this week, give the three women a fair hearing

‘We believe firmly that it is the role of the artist to make legitimate political protest and fight for freedom of speech.

‘As he visits the United Kingdom this week, we ask President Putin to ensure these three women receive a fair hearing.’

In February, the women climbed into an area reserved for priests in the Church of Christ the Saviour and performed a ‘punk prayer’ against Putin.

The trio were arrested in March and charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred of Orthodox believers.

A further ten members of the band, supporters and a few selected journalists were also present during the demonstration but were never arrested.

The three young women said they had wanted to change Russia with their action but could have made an ‘ethical’ mistake by offending worshippers.

They do however maintain they are innocent to the charges.

The Russian premier is due to meet David Cameron for talks today.
