Kadian Harding, pictured, died after the brakes failed on his bicycle just hours after he had sent it in for a service to a shop in Marlborough, Wiltshire

It was a tragedy that is every parent’s nightmare. As Thomas Harding looked on in helpless horror, his 14-year-old son’s bicycle careered out of control and into the path of a van, killing him instantly.

Witnesses described how the boy, Kadian, pumped desperately at his brakes as he hurtled down a steep hill toward the busy road, but to no avail.

Now grief-stricken Thomas and his wife Debora have launched a £300,000 High Court action against a bike shop that serviced the brakes on Kadian’s cycle just hours before the fatal accident, claiming negligence.

The accident is a moment that will haunt Thomas for ever. ‘I am reliving what happened every day, every moment,’ he said.

Thomas, Kadian and four others had been enjoying a bike ride through the Wiltshire Downs on a beautiful July day when tragedy struck. 

After the inquest, Thomas explained: ‘The path narrowed and became overgrown. We slowed down. My head was down, avoiding rocks and roots. But when I looked up, Kadian was suddenly way ahead, the gradient had become steeper, the track rockier, and then, incredibly, I saw him struck by something moving left to right. One moment he was here, then he was gone.’

The accident happened just 30ft in front of him. ‘I dropped my bike and ran on to the road,’ he recalled. ‘Kadian was lying on the road. He looked like a young boy again. He wasn’t moving. And then I was howling. Crouched a few yards away, hands over my face. Wailing.’

A coroner later ruled that there had been a ‘complete catastrophic failure’ of the front brake, and only partial functioning of the rear. But inquest rules prevented him attributing blame.

The family are now suing Acceler8, the Marlborough bike shop that examined Kadian’s brakes just hours before the crash.

Philip Birkett, owner of Acceler8, accepts that Kadian had come into the shop and asked him to look at the gears and the rear brakes. Giving evidence to last year’s inquest, he said: ‘I stand by my work and everything I did was correct. When that bike left the shop it was in a perfectly safe condition.’

Debora Harding, pictured,  described her son Kadian as 'a teenager on the brink of manhood'

He conceded he did not hold any qualifications for repairing bikes but said he ‘never felt the need to do so – I feel comfortable with my abilities’.

Mr Birkett adjusted the gears, replaced a worn rear brake cable and reset the rear brakes.

Kadian, of Steep, near Petersfield, Hampshire, had spent his savings on the ‘long haul trucker’ touring bicycle, which he had assembled himself. Thomas, a writer and an experienced cyclist, had taken the bike for a ride two days before his son’s death. He felt the brakes were ‘functioning’ but not ‘optimal’ – and told his son to get them checked out.

He said at the inquest: ‘I specifically said, “We are really concerned about the brakes. You must get the front and back brakes looked at.’

Kadian told his father that Acceler8 looked over all the brakes and replaced a cable.

‘I didn’t have a go but I did try both front and back brakes,’ Thomas told the inquest. ‘I noticed they were much firmer now.’

That same afternoon – July 25, 2012 – the party went for the fateful ride.

Describing the moments before the crash, Mr Harding told Wiltshire coroner David Ridley: ‘We weren’t going that fast. We were cycling in tandem, then he was suddenly ahead of me.

‘It made no sense that Kadian wouldn’t stop because you could see the road and there was plenty of time to stop.’

A witness, Richard Knowles, who lives nearby, said he heard the schoolboy screaming and saw him pumping his brakes.

‘He was standing up on the pedals,’ said Mr Knowles. ‘He was applying so much force to his brakes that he was trying to keep the bike stable.

‘I think I said to him words to the effect of “Come off.” He made no attempt to steer off the path. He made no attempt to come off the pedals and put his feet on the floor.’

Thomas has given an insight into the pain the accident has caused to his family in a newly published book, Kadian Journal, which gives an emotional and honest account of the accident, its aftermath and memories of his son’s life. ‘You could say that Kadian had been born from a bike,’ Thomas has said.

He and Debora met in 1987 as they took part in an American coast- to-coast ride with about 30 students.

Debora was not on the ride which claimed her son’s life, as she was in Washington DC, where she was chief executive of a bicycle company.

In the book, Thomas writes movingly of the moment that they removed the stabilisers from a four-year-old Kadian’s turquoise cycle as he sat with plastic knee-guards over his corduroy trousers.

Tom Harding, right, said he asked his son Kadian, second left, to get the brakes on his bike checked professionally, pictured with his mother Debora, left and 12-year-old sister Sam, front right 

‘As he wobbled and gathered speed to complete a childhood rite of passage, he cried in delight, “I’m doing it. I’m doing it.” ’

The book is just one of the ways the Hardings are keeping Kadian’s memory alive. They have set up a website in his honour and are working with cycle charity Sustrans to promote safer cycling routes.

As well the lawsuit – brought under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 via their solicitors, Leigh Day – the Hardings have been campaigning for new legislation that mechanics should be qualified before they can be employed in bike shops.

They raised the issue at the inquest, but the coroner dismissed it, saying he did not believe the Government should create more red tape for small businesses.

A ‘To let’ sign currently hangs over the Acceler8 store in Marlborough, with neighbouring traders saying it closed for business a month ago.

Both parents – who also have a daughter, Sam, two years younger than Kadian – have paid moving tributes to their son in newspaper articles.

Debora has written: ‘Those who knew him say he had an extraordinary mix of social skills and intelligence for his age... He was a young teenager on the brink of manhood and had all the promise of being an amazing contributor to the world.’

And Thomas has said: ‘The day after Kadian died, my wife and I woke up in a terror. Is it true? Is he gone? How can it be possible? That our generous, kind, smart, quirky, assured, beautiful boy could be gone.

‘The pain was massive, unbearable. How were we supposed to live in this world?’

Now he and his wife can only wait for a judge to decide whether negligence cruelly tore their son away.
