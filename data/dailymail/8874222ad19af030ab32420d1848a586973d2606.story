Katie Couric revealed this week that she once went on first dates with 
Full House star Bob Saget and Survivor host Jeff Probst - but neither 
ever called her again.

Now the guys have given their take on their experience with the TV journalist and talk show host, now 56.

In an endearing email to Us Weekly, Probst revealed a mutual friend first tried to set them up in 2001, but 'the timing never worked out'.

It wasn't meant to be: Katie Couric and Jeff Probst have both given their take on their first - and only - date

The 51-year-old continued: 'A few years later the same friend connected us again and this time the date was set. The next time I was in New York we would have dinner.'

Not interested: She also went to dinner once with Bob Saget

'What I remember most about the date is how nervous I was and how little I offered to the conversation,' Probst recalled.

'It was like I forgot how to go on a date. Like I was 14. We talked a bit about her kids and the challenges of being a parent to teenagers, and we talked a bit about our careers and lifestyles but we never got much beyond the surface."

He insists he 'would have definitely asked for a second date' and added that 'it wasn't lack of interest' on his part.

'The only reason I didn't call back was the date was set up through her assistant and I never got her number. It felt weird to call her assistant for a second date,' he said.

'So it never had a chance to be a romance. Who knows what might have been? But it's a date I definitely remember! I mean, come on, it's Katie Couric!'

Probst, who is currently shooting Survivor: Blood vs. Water, went on to marry to Lisa Ann Russell, 41, in 2011.

Full House star Saget, 57, also chimed in on his first and only date with Couric.

'I did a benefit with Katie Couric in New York and I went to dinner with her,' he told Us Weekly on Thursday.

'She's a lovely person and we had a good time. I've seen her many times since.'

He revealed that Couric 'gave me a hard time' about his lack of interest.

'She told it on a talk show and I think she told it again,' Saget said. 'I think she's out of material.'

Couric, who has two Caroline, 17, and
Ellie, 21, with her late husband Jay Monahan, is now in year-long 
romance with NYC financier John Molner.

She spoke about her one-time dates with the Hollywood stars in an interview with Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show on Wednesday.

'I can't say that I was devastated that neither called me back,' she said.

'I thought they were both nice 
guys... I don't think there was real magic there with either [of them], 
but I enjoyed spending time with them.'
