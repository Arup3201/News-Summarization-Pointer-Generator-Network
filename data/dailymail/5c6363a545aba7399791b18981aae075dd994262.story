Rory McIlroy insisted his looming court battle with his ex-management company will have no bearing on his golf as he outlined a seven-point plan to rule the world once more in 2015.

As usual, the 25-year-old Northern Irishman is starting his season at the HSBC Abu Dhabi Championship here on Thursday and is targeting an instant winning start. ‘I definitely feel like I have unfinished business at this event,’ said the world No 1.

No wonder. Last year he took fewer strokes than anyone else but lost out to Pablo Larrazabal after picking up a daft two-shot penalty during the third round, when he failed to take full relief from ground under repair. He would also have won in 2012 but for another two-shot penalty that could easily have been avoided.

‘It is a course I definitely feel comfortable on and, after the year I’ve just enjoyed in 2014, I feel like I am going into the event with momentum,’ said McIlroy. ‘It was great to take time off over Christmas and reflect on what I achieved and watch some highlights of my wins. But it’s time to move on and in practice I’ve been hitting the ball really well.’

As he does every year, McIlroy passed the time away during his first flight of the campaign from Dublin to the Middle East by writing down his goals on the back of a boarding pass. ‘There are seven written down and obviously I am not going to reveal them publicly,’ he said. ‘But I will keep the boarding pass in my wallet and then take it out at the end of the season and see whether I’ve achieved them all.

‘I didn’t manage it last year. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever managed it. I set my goals pretty high. Last year, for example, I wrote down six wins worldwide but only managed four. It was still a good year though.’

McIlroy is hoping to go even better this year than his Open and US PGA Championship wins of 2014

Naturally, McIlroy was smiling broadly when he made that last tongue-in-cheek comment. He knows it is going to be exceedingly difficult to emulate a year that saw him win two majors – the Open and the USPGA Championship.

But he was adamant that spending large parts of next month in a Dublin courtroom will have no bearing on trying to become just the sixth player to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters. 

‘Why should it have any bearing or be a distraction?’ said McIlroy. ‘I literally have not thought about it since I had some meetings with lawyers last November. It’s no big deal. I’m not bothered about having to stand up in court. What have I got to be worried about? I’ve just got to stand there and tell the truth. It’s no big deal. I’ll be okay at the end of the day.’

The Ulsterman looked in good spirits during his press conference in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday morning 

McIlroy is both suing and being countersued by Horizon Sports, and the stakes are high. If he loses, it could cost him tens of millions of pounds.

As for Augusta, McIlroy revealed he is likely to alter his schedule in the build-up. He normally likes to play the week before in Houston but is aware the hype will be off the charts by then. Accordingly, he is likely to take that week off and make the Arnold Palmer Invitational event, which takes place a fortnight earlier, his last tournament before the Masters.

‘It’s definitely a strong possibility I will play Arnie’s event but it depends how I am playing regarding Houston,’ he said. ‘If I feel I need to play some more golf then I will definitely add it to the schedule.’

As things stand, however, Plan A is to play five events before the year’s first major – starting on Thursday here in Abu Dhabi.
