The lawyer for a NYU student accused of setting his classmate's bed on fire while she slept claims the victim could have been participating because she was drunk.

Part-time real estate agent Jaime Castano, 20, allegedly burned the 19-year-old's mattress in his dorm room last August while singing to her, recording the incident on a cell phone and posting it on Snapchat.

At his arraignment last week, the student's attorney Alyssa Gamliel suggested the victim had blacked out during a booze binge and may have been complicit, according to the New York Daily News. 

Allegations: Jaime Castano, 20, has been accused of setting fire to the to the 19-year-old's (not pictured) mattress in NYU accomodation last August while singing her, recording the incident and posting it on Snapchat

'I do not think she knows what happened or her participation in this, nor do I think the People will be able to prove that she was not sort of participating in some of this activity,' she told a judge at Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. 

The teenager suffered 'painful burns and scarring to her torso', it was alleged in a criminal complaint.

However Gamliel argues that the injuries became infected because she failed to treat them and could have been a result of her 'continued behavior of intoxication'. 

The victim claims she and a third person were with Castano at his dorm room on Lafayette Street when she fell asleep at about 11pm on August 23.

Case: If convicted of first-degree assault, Castano could be jailed for up to 25 years

At around 6am the following the morning she woke to find holes and burn marks on her bed and blankets, burns on her clothes, and painful burns on her body, prosecutors told the broadcaster.

But she wasn't aware of what caused the fire until she saw Castano's video, which he had shared with the photo-messaging application, it is claimed

The victim reported the attack to university officials but they did not alert police until October 27 - more than two months after it allegedly occurred. 

If convicted of first-degree assault, Castano could be jailed for up to 25 years.  

He was expelled by NYU in September after an internal investigation, although his attorney told the judge Monday that he left the private university voluntarily.
