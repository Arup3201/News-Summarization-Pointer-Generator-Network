A prostitute  entered a suite in a Paris hotel and saw Dominique Strauss-Kahn being ‘taken care of’ by up to eight women, it is alleged.

The testimony is part of the prosecution evidence being used to try the disgraced former International Monetary Fund chief for ‘aggravated pimping’.

His trial for allegedly taking part in an international prostitution ring, which began yesterday in Lille, will include details of what Sandrine Vandenschrik says she witnessed at the four-star Murano Hotel.

‘I was shocked – I didn’t want to get involved in this carnage,’ she said in a police interview that forms part of hundreds of pages of evidence submitted by prosecutors.

Strauss-Kahn, 65, insists he did not know his lovers were call girls, but Miss Vandenschrik told police: ‘He really wants us to believe he’s naive and takes us for idiots.’

He faces up to a decade in prison and a £1million-plus fine in a case which shines a light on some of the seediest corners of French public life.

Strauss-Kahn, dressed in a black suit and tie, appeared alongside 13 co-defendants, including one known as ‘Dodo the pimp’.

Looking tired and drawn, he stared at the floor constantly, only occasionally taking part in whispered conversations with his lawyers.

Strauss-Kahn is said to have attended orgies in cities all over the world in which politicians, police chiefs and captains of industry enjoyed the services of highly paid prostitutes. 

He admits having a huge sexual appetite and attending what he described as ‘libertine’ parties, but denies knowing that any of the girls were prostitutes, saying it was impossible to tell what they did professionally because they were all naked. 

It is not illegal to pay for sex in France, but it is against the law to solicit or to run a prostitution business.

DSK, as he is known, was head of the Washington-based IMF between 2007 and 2011, and was considered a shoo-in to become French president as the Socialist Party’s candidate in 2012.

But his career collapsed in 2011 when a chambermaid at a New York hotel accused him of attempting to rape her. While those charges were dropped and the case settled in a civil suit, DSK soon faced equally depraved allegations.

Miss Vandenschrik and other women accused DSK – who was married to journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair at the time of the alleged offences – of attending orgies not only in Paris, but also close to the IMF offices in Washington.

Other witnesses at the orgies described DSK in the height of ‘pure sexual consummation’, with women all over his writhing body.

The trial is expected to last for three weeks, with DSK giving evidence next week.

Once tipped to become the next president of France, Dominique Strauss Kahn became the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, in 2007.

But the powerful French lawyer and politician's was left in tatters after he was accused of raping a chambermaid at a New York hotel in 2011. 

Nafissatou Diallo, 32, alleged that Strauss Kahn had assaulted her when she entered his room. The case later collapsed because of problems surrounding the credibility of the witness and he settled out of court.

He resigned from the IMF on 18 May 2011 but a series of sordid revelations about Strauss Khan's sex life were too follow.

Journalist Tristane Banon came forward during the case claiming that Strauss Kahn had attempted to rape her. He admitted trying to kiss her but in October 2011, prosecutors dropped the case over lack of evidence.

The following year, Strauss Kahn came under investigation over his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring which was linked to hiring prostitutes for sex parties at hotels in Lille, Paris and Washington.

Charges of gang rape in Washington were dropped in October 2012 after the alleged victim told police they were playing consensual 'sex games'.

In July 2013, the shamed former IMF boss was told he would stand trial over allegations of 'aggravated pimping' at the Carlton Hotel in Lille, France in a case which would later become known as the Carlton Affair.

The scandal-struck life of Strauss Kahn was the inspiration for film Welcome to New York - featuring 'Gérard Depardieu as Devereaux, a character modeled on D.S.K.
