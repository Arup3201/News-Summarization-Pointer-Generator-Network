When Stewart Watts returned home on leave from the army he decided to buy his 11-month-old daughter Poppy a present. 

But Mr Watts, who is based with the Yorkshire Regiment, was shocked when he gave his child a toy tool kit to play with and saw her pull out a five-inch knife and place it in her mouth. 

Gina Barratt, 24, also spotted the blade and managed to quickly grab it from her daughter as she played with the new £11.99 toy at their home in Sheffield.

'We are just relieved she wasn't hurt, but I am disgusted,' said Miss Barratt. 

'How could something like a sharp blade get into a children's toy?'

Gina Barratt, 24, found a five-inch long knife in a toy tool set her partner had bought for their 11-month-old daughter Poppy for £11.99 from Poundstretcher, which the baby girl then put into her mouth as she played

Mr Watts was on leave from Catterick army base in north Yorkshire last month and bought the tool kit from Poundstretcher.

The kit comes in a train-shaped case and has several plastic tools inside including a spanner and a drill. 

Miss Barratt said: 'My partner opened the tool set, but he didn't see the knife. 

'He put the set down for Poppy to play with.

'The kit is in a train set and there are spaces for the tools to fit inside. Poppy took all the tools out and they were on the floor.

'She picked up the knife and that was when Stewart noticed it. She put the shiny bit of the knife in her mouth. It's a knife with a long blade with cardboard wrapped around part of it.

'Luckily Poppy did not get hurt, because Stewart was with her, but she is at the age where you can leave her to play with things. She's always putting things in her mouth, it's what children her age do.' 

The toy cost £11.99 and had been reduced but Miss Barratt said it was properly sealed when Mr Watts bought it. 

She said she was concerned there could be more blades in other toys being sold by the company and felt they had not taken her complaint seriously. 

Poppy (right) was not injured after she put the blade into her mouth but Miss Barratt is worried about the toy

The  five-inch knife was packed in the tool set, which was sealed when it was bought from Poundstretcher

'I called quite a few times and nobody phoned me back for a few days,' added Miss Barratt. 

'I couldn't believe that they didn't react straight away because there could more of these blades about.'

Poundstretcher said an investigation had been launched into the 'unfortunate incident' and they believed it was an isolated case.  

A spokesman for the company said: 'We would like to apologise to Gina and her family.

'Our products are rigorously tested by the manufacturers and we are investigating how this unfortunate incident happened.'
