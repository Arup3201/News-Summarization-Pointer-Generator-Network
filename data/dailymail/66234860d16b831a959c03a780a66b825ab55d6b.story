If you're rather fond of the way you look, then this is the coffee for you.

A Taiwanese cafe chain has designed a special latte printer which creates portraits of customers directly on their drinks.

It has proved a huge success for the Let’s Cafe chain of small kiosks which are dotted all over Taiwan.

New: Lets Cafe needed something to compete with big players like Starbucks and so designed this accurate coffee printing machine

Faced with the challenge of competing with larger more established cafe chains, they had to come up with a truly original gimmick in order to attract customers.

Let’s Cafe needed something not even big players like Starbucks could compete with, and they found it in this extremely accurate coffee printing machine.

Coffee drinkers firstly need to upload a photograph 
from their mobile phone to the coffee dispenser machine.

After the 
cup has been filled with the drink of their choice, the 
incorporated printer uses edible ink to sprinkle their photo on the milk
foam.

People can also add text to the drinks as well. Loved-up couples have added 'I am yours' to their drinks, while people taking pictures with their pets have wrote: 'My lovely Kitty.'

Other coffee shops have previously had talented latte artists create incredible designs using rudimentary tools and a steady hand.

This can include love-hearts and Shamrocks.

However, this coffee printer is able to produce more photo-realistic images.
