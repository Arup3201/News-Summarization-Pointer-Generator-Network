Queens Park Rangers defender Clint Hill’s furious exchange with a supporter on Saturday was sparked by his fears for one of the club’s young fans.

Hill was involved in an angry confrontation with a Rangers fan, who had a child with him, following QPR’s loss at Burnley. The supporter launched into an x-rated tirade at Hill and team-mate Richard Dunne, questioning the pair’s commitment.

Dunne responded with a foul-mouthed tongue-lashing of his own before Hill, who has helped the club to two promotions during his time at Loftus Road, became embroiled in the incident. Sportsmail understands Hill’s issue with the supporter was the language he was using in front of the child, who is said to have looked ‘petrified’.

The ill-tempered situation is understood to have continued outside the ground as other Rangers fans confronted the supporter in question.

The loss at Turf Moor was QPR’s 10th in a row on the road in the Premier League this season — the worst away run in the top-flight for 50 years. Joey Barton said: ‘These are testing times. There is no hiding place. We have to show a big set of b******s and pick ourselves up.

‘We have got Manchester United coming up (on Saturday) and we have to go and start digging results out. It’s just a case of head down and graft. I’ve never been in a situation like this before — so good at home and so poor away.’

Harry Redknapp was furious with the two goals QPR gave away in the first half as Scott Arfield and Danny Ings scored either side of a penalty converted by former Burnley favourite Charlie Austin.

And Barton echoed Redknapp’s sentiments, saying: ‘He’s as p****d off as anyone. The goals we gave away were absolutely shocking. If you defend like that at this level you are going to be punished.’

A deserved fourth victory of the season saw Burnley move out of the relegation zone, and their next three league fixtures are against the teams directly above them in the table: Crystal Palace, Sunderland and West Brom.

‘The next month is big,’ admitted defender Michael Keane. ‘We want to stay in this league and we believe with the performances we’ve put in recently we can do that. We need to win our games at home against the teams around us.’

The England Under-21 international was making his first appearance since turning his loan from Manchester United into a £2million move. ‘I’d been there for nearly 12 years but I thought it was the right time,’ he said. ‘It’s not a step back because I’m playing in the Premier League. If I was there I wouldn’t have been, so it’s actually a step forward if you look at it like that.’
