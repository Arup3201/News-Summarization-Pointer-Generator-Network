Clint Dempsey's skills aren't limited to the football pitch, it seems, as the Seattle Sounders forward showed off his musical talent by rapping at the FIFA 15 launch party in New York.

Dempsey, who signed for Seattle in August 2013, makes music in his spare time, and is even releasing an album with rapper XO in the near future.

The American's performance was met with whoops and cheers from an enthusiastic crowd of fans and photographers, and gave the public a sneak peak of what to expect from Dempsey's upcoming release.

The song, titled 'Hot Fire', begun solely with XO on stage, before Dempsey emerged from the wings to join his rap partner. The pair were then joined by Trae Tha Truth for second half of the song.

Dempsey is not the first footballer to release a rap though, of course, and has plenty of work to do to if he is to reach the lofty heights of ex-Liverpool winger John Barnes, whose World In Motion rap is still popular every time England play in a major tournament.

All together now: You've got to hold and give, but do it at the right time...
