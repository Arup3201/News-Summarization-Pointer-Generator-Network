After the ignominy of England’s early exit from the World Cup, Kai Rooney showed his father Wayne how it should have been done during a kick-about on the beach in Brazil.

The four-year-old was seen in tears after watching England lose to Uruguay on Thursday, but he bounced back to show off his own footballing skills on Ipanema beach in Rio De Janeiro, watched by his mother Coleen.

In contrast, his father appeared despondent as he and goalkeeper Joe Hart braved a press conference yesterday to apologise in person to travelling fans for the team’s dismal performance.

He shoots! He scores! Rooney hits the back of the net. Only this time it's Kai Rooney not daddy Wayne

Wayne Rooney said it was ‘very disappointing… and it’s not a great feeling to go out of the tournament after two games’. He earlier posted on Facebook: ‘Going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it hasn’t worked out. Sorry to all the fans who travelled and at home that we haven’t done better… gutted!’

Other players offered similar sentiments, with Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere tweeting: ‘Gutted doesn’t come close to how I am feeling right now. Sorry to all the fans who came out and supported us, and everyone back home!’

Following their elimination, the players mooched around their hotel, the Royal Tulip, on Friday night – although manager Roy Hodgson enjoyed a burger and chips and bottles of Heineken with FA chairman Greg Dyke and coaching staff in an American diner.

Afterwards, the big question of the day was not how to rebuild his shattered squad but which ice cream to select. Hodgson questioned the waiter at length about the flavours and possible combinations, pondering his decision as if considering who to play up front.

Back at the hotel, Hodgson, Dyke and Neville settled themselves in a corner of the bar and drank wine, calling it a day at just gone 11pm.

Earlier, during the Italy-Costa Rica match, Hodgson looked careworn. Italy needed to beat Costa Rica to give his boys a slither of hope of remaining in the World Cup but lost 1-0.

Along with Dyke, most of the players and the backroom staff, the 66-year-old England manager watched the game on a giant screen in the hotel’s heavily guarded conference room.

Dyke was the first to appear as the final whistle signalled the end for Roy’s boys.

This was the man who appeared to demonstrate his view of England’s chances by making a throat-slitting gesture when the draw was announced last December.

This time, he threw his hands up in despair and sighed deeply. ‘Could have done without that,’ he said.

Next came Hodgson, who, when asked how the players were bearing up, bit hard on his bottom lip before saying: ‘Bit disappointed.’

Southampton defender Luke Shaw, 18, admitted later: ‘It’s horrible, just horrible, the worst feeling of my life. Everyone’s in bits.’
