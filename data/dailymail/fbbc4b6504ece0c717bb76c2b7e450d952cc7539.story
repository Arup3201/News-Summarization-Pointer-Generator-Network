There are grave suspicions within UEFA that the Michael Garcia report into World Cup bid corruption will be altered by FIFA lawyers before it is published to protect president Sepp Blatter.

This follows German magazine Der Spiegel’s revelations that criticisms of Blatter contained in FIFA governance committee chairman Mark Pieth’s reform report last year were removed by Zurich’s legal advisor Marco Villiger.

UEFA chief Michel Platini has damned the blatant interference by FIFA.

His spokesman said: ‘This shows FIFA’s independent governance committee was anything but independent. 

UEFA has always wondered why it was criticised by Mr Pieth and wrongly accused of blocking FIFA reforms. Now we understand why.’

It’s also been suggested American lawyer Garcia’s shock resignation from his FIFA investigative role in protest at Hans-Joachim Eckert’s summary of his findings might be more to do with his Blatter observations being ‘amended’ than detail involving Russia or Qatar.

FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali of Jordan said: ‘Something is not right at the heart of FIFA governance. 

Without publishing the Garcia report in full, FIFA faces ongoing public suspicion that interference may have occurred.’

FIFA, who called the Pieth report legal marks ‘standard procedure’, claim only five changes were made and say: ‘There can be no question of FIFA exerting unfair influence.’

Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner  continues to send mixed messages out of Villa Park as to whether he wants to sell the Premier League club. But certainly Lerner prefers to sped this time of year holidaying at the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados rather than watching his team in action.

Channel 4, having flirted with the idea of having racing fan Jeremy Kyle present their flagship Grand National coverage on April 11 to appeal to a wider audience, are understood to be reverting to their normal racing anchor Nick Luck in the absence of Clare Balding, who has opted to cover the Boat Race for BBC.

lt hasn’t helped the turmoil at Leicester City that Jon Rudkin, director of football and friend of the Thai owners, has no relationship with manager Nigel Pearson, who is believed to have been sacked and then re-instated on Sunday. 

Rudkin has been in his role since before Christmas when he replaced Terry Robinson. Before that, he was Leicester’s academy director and he has kept out of Pearson’s way following a previous falling-out.

BT make their move

The £4billion Premier League TV rights tender goes into a second round on Tuesday morning with revised bids due by midday. The seven packages are expected to be awarded later in the day.

Although the Discovery Channel and beIN Sport have shown interest, the most likely scenario is that Sky will retain four prime packages while BT get an increased number of games, up to 56 out of the 168 live matches being sold per season for three years. 

Overall, the likely cost will be around £8m per game.

However, Sky retaining the 4pm Sunday slot package, which has the most first picks attached to it, will allow them to dominate the choice of games as they have done since the start of the Barclays Premier League.

The FA, whose relationship with FIFA can hardly get worse, are further exasperated by Zurich not only dumping the regulation of agents back on national associations but also banning third-party ownership across world football but not giving proper guidance as to how this will work. 

This follows the FIFA ExCo banning emergency loans between clubs despite the FIFA executive and Players Status Committee supporting the system — as well as the whole of English football.

England’s Ashes-winning women’s cricket team have posed in contemporary ball gowns for a magazine photoshoot in the Lord’s Long Room for sponsors Waitrose.

The original idea was for them to wear Downton Abbey style dresses. Not a good move after the ‘Downton Shabby’ Twitter attack launched on England cricket chief Paul Downton by Kevin Pietersen’s cheerleader, Piers Morgan.
