Like a child in a sweet shop, my eyes goggled at the array of inviting colours. Should I go for pillar box red, tangerine orange or deep plum?

As I tested each shade out in front of the shop mirror, pouting and stretching my mouth into one teeth-baring smile after another, I noticed the assistant giving me strange looks.

But I didn’t care. She wasn’t to know what a momentous occasion this was. For the best part of 20 years, I had worn lipstick on only a handful of occasions.

Smiling and wearing lipstick, you see, would only draw attention to the part of my face that I hated: my teeth.

With a crooked front pair that jutted forward and overlapped and big gaping holes at the sides, I preferred to keep my mouth shut. 

But now, at 43, after wearing fixed train-track braces for 15 long months, I finally have a smile to flaunt.

At a cost of £4500, my overbite has been hoiked back, my front teeth uncrossed and straightened, and four gaping holes, where teeth were misguidedly taken out as a teenager, closed.

The results are not perfect. According to my specialist orthodontist, Dr Erika Ruiz-Mealin at Bhuva Dental Care in London, only corrective jaw surgery — breaking, moving and rewiring the supporting bones — could give me a full-on Hollywood smile.

Beaming: Lauren after having her braces removed and feeling much happier

But I am not complaining. As well as buying three new lipsticks, I have been flashing my new smile at every opportunity as I lay to rest the ghosts of a protruding set of gnashers that has tarnished some of my happiest moments.

My primary school nicknames included Bugs Bunny, Goofy and Fraggle (after the puppets in the cartoon Fraggle Rock) and at 13, my teeth were awful enough to earn me free treatment on the NHS.

I had train-track braces for two years, wisdom teeth removed, an overnight head brace, more teeth out and even surgery to remove my frenulum, the string of tissue under my top lip.

Frankly, I think my orthodontist was at his wits’ end because even he couldn’t understand why, by the age of 16, my teeth didn’t look remarkably different from when the treatment began.

Not a vain person, I learned to live with my less-than-perfect teeth and perfected a small, tight smile for the camera.

After: I now have a thin wire fixed behind my teeth to keep them in place and a set of clear retainers which look like gum shields to wear every night for the rest of my life. It's a small price to pay for a perfect smile.

It was there in the pictures of my 30th birthday party which I co-hosted in a cool basement bar in Central London with my very attractive friend, Samantha.

We were both tipsy and while she wrapped an arm around me and beamed, I looked stiff and po-faced, as if I couldn’t wait to leave.

Concerns about my looks inevitably had an impact on my confidence when it came to the opposite sex.  And, I couldn’t help but wonder whether my snaggle teeth were the reason I was still single when so many of my friends were being snapped up.

But at 31 I met Colin, who thought my buck teeth quirky and cute. Nonetheless, that same tight smile was there on the happiest day of my life — our wedding day in December 2005.

The photographer kept saying, ‘Give us a nice, big smile please, Lauren’ and, ‘Bit bigger?’ then, ‘More happy?’

I was happy. Very happy. I just didn’t want to show my teeth.

Tight-lipped: Until Lauren got her teeth fixed, she hated showing her teeth in photos. 'Even now, I look back at those pictures 
and don’t see the beautiful antique dress or the lovely husband beside 
me. Instead, I hone in on the big front tooth resting on my lower lip.' Pictured: aged 12, left. At her graduation, right.

Even now, I look back at those pictures and don’t see the beautiful antique dress or the lovely husband beside me. Instead, I hone in on the big front tooth resting on my lower lip.

It bothered me so much that when I became the editor of Top Sante magazine at 37 and had to have my picture taken for the Editor’s letter page, I insisted my teeth were digitally retouched to give me a beautiful, even smile.

I was particularly self-conscious when I had to meet new advertising clients or give presentations to large groups of people.

By the time my 40th birthday came round, I was starting to feel the dissatisfaction more acutely.

The overlap of my two front teeth seemed to be getting worse and there was now a dark yellow staining between them where my toothbrush could no longer reach. I started to do my research.

During treatment: I opted for the more subtle porcelain white variety of train track. The treatment was arduous; my teeth were often tender and my mouth full of ulcers and grazes where the tracks rubbed against my gums.

According to the British Orthodontic Society, adults were now making up half of the patients in some practices and enquiries for adult braces were up 135 per cent since 2011. 

After discussing it with Colin and my family, who understood the extent of my unhappiness, I decided to have a consultation.

Dr Erika explained she could improve my smile dramatically by fixing metal braces to the front of my upper and lower teeth for up to 18 months.

I would have to visit her every four to six weeks to have them tightened — with thicker wires and elastic bands — and I would experience some discomfort along the way. I didn’t hesitate.

I couldn’t bite into hard foods and my cleaning routine — with interdental brushes and mouthwash and rigorous brushing — kept me in the bathroom for a good half hour each night.

Friends only noticed the braces when I pointed them out, and were very curious, some even contemplating work themselves.
