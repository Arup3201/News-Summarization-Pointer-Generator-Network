A promising young British soldier was accidentally shot dead when his colleagues took a barrel off a machine gun as it pointed directly at him on a live firing exercise, a court martial heard today.

Fusilier James Wilkinson, 21, of Bury, Greater Manchester, from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was allegedly killed by the negligence of his own men in Nanyuki, Kenya.

His Section Commander, Corporal Colin Bell, had taken the barrel off a machine gun to inspect a stoppage when it fired off a round at the British Army Training Unit, shooting him in the neck.

The married father-to-be was killed on the firing range. He and a colleague were manning a general purpose machine gun in the mock battle for more than 100 troops in hot terrain, the court heard.

To their right, Fusilier Aaron Davenport, a gunner, and Fusilier Renaldo Nelson, a controller, also from 2RRF, were operating another, watched by their safety supervisor Cpl Bell.

This gun jammed and would not fire - known in military terms as a ‘hard cock’ - making it impossible to check if the firearm was unloaded, Bulford Military Court Centre in Wiltshire heard.

But instead of following safety procedure and calling in an armourer to fix it, Cpl Bell allegedly got Fusilier Davenport and Fusilier  Nelson to remove the weapon from its position and he took it apart.

Cpl Bell placed the gun on the ground, pointing directly at the gun team, and removed the barrel.

Troops were alerted to Fusilier Wilkinson, hailed as a very fit soldier with ‘long term potential’ by the Ministry of Defence, being down by someone shouting ‘Stop! Stop! Stop!’.

Now three of his comrades - Fusilier Davenport, Fusilier Nelson and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price are on trial for negligently performing a duty. Cpl Bell is also accused of negligently performing a duty.

Prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Callum Cowx told the jury: ‘Each of these men failed to do what they were required to do and they each in their own way led to the tragic outcome.

‘The crown’s case is about basic principles, about basic common sense, which we say are commonly understood by anyone wearing this Army uniform.

‘It is about basic duties expected of a 
safety supervisor on live firing exercises. I ask you to keep in mind 
these principles and common sense in the judgement of the facts.’

‘Each defendant owed a duty of care to James Wilkinson. They owed him a duty that he was not put in danger. Each neglected this and the consequences were catastrophic.’

Fusilier Wilkinson’s distraught widow Sarah wept in court as she heard details of the fatal incident on November 26 2011, less than five months after their wedding.

She was seven months’ pregnant with the couple’s first child at the time, and has since given birth to a healthy daughter.

Lt Col Cowx said: ‘Cpl Bell, clearly anxious to get one of his guns back in action, demanded to know what was happening and was told it was a hard cock. Hearing this, he ordered for it to be brought to him. The prosecution case is that that gun should not have been moved.

‘But Davenport and Nelson brought the gun over to him, and Bell asked if it was cleared or was it unloaded. Fusilier Nelson responded that yes, it was, it was clear.

‘This, of course, was incorrect - there was a live round in the weapon. They should have realised this. They were experienced infantry soldiers used to handling machine guns.’

Captain Kye Raynard, a range conducting officer, was around 25 metres away from WIlkinson when tragedy struck during the ‘fast moving’ exercise.

He said a safety supervisor should call in an armourer to deal with a stoppage, adding: ‘You cannot remove the round, so the round will be stuck in the weapons system.

‘So the safest way of removing it would be to get an armourer onto the range and make sure the weapon is pointing in a safe direction while you wait.’

Manchester United FC fan Fusilier Wilkinson was born into a serving Army family in Germany.

He joined the Army in May 2011 and trained at Catterick, North Yorkshire, before being deployed to Kenya on his first Battalion level exercise, Ex Askari Thunder.

The MoD described Fusilier Wilkinson as an ‘exceptionally fit’ soldier who was ‘happy, enthusiastic and immensely popular across all ranks’ and had ‘obvious long term potential’.

Fusilier Davenport and Fusilier Nelson deny negligence performing a duty in misinforming Cpl Bell as to the safety state of the gun and failing to prevent the discharge of a round.

Staff Sgt Price denies negligence performing a duty by failing to prevent the unintentional discharge of a round from the gun. The court martial continues tomorrow.
