Kolo Toure has questioned whether Chelsea have the mental strength to complete an unbeaten season as he warned Liverpool are out to wreck their ‘Invincible’ ambitions.

The Ivorian, who excelled in Liverpool’s 1-0 defeat against Real Madrid, was part of the Arsenal side that marched imperiously through the 2003-04 campaign without losing a game in the Barclays Premier League.

It has become a source of debate as to whether Jose Mourinho’s current squad can replicate that achievement following their flying start, with another question being how many trophies Chelsea will actually win.

Toure, though, has explained how difficult it is to see off all-comers and predicted that the biggest tests still await Chelsea, despite them having travelled to Old Trafford and the Etihad Stadium already.

Next up for Chelsea is a collision with Liverpool on Saturday lunchtime and there is much riding on the outcome of that contest, particularly given the history between the two clubs. The wounds Chelsea inflicted on April 27 this year when winning 2-0, after all, are still fresh.

‘Chelsea have a good team,’ said Toure. ‘With the squad they have of course they can do it, but its not the only quality. It is about mentality. Every game is challenging and sometimes things don’t go well for you but you need to be able to come back and carry on fighting. The season has just started. We will see.

‘It’s a great chance (to end the argument)! But the most important is we want to win the game. It’s a very important game when you think what they do to us last season, that cost us the league and now we have the chance to beat them. I can’t wait for that, honestly.

‘Every game for Liverpool you want to win and Chelsea are playing well now. When you play at home in a game like that it is going to be attacking teams. Chelsea attack and Liverpool attack as well. I think you are going to see a great game. We want to win

‘This season they will attack … with the players they have they can’t defend all the time. I think they will just try to score goal and we will try to score goals. It’s going to be a great game, definitely.’

Having been out in the cold for most of the season, starting only in Capital One Cup games against Middlesbrough and Swansea, Toure seized his chance to impress Brendan Rodgers in the Bernabeu Stadium and he hopes to have given his manager a dilemma.

‘I was talking to somebody (before game in Madrid) and I was saying that Ronaldo won’t score… and he didn’t score!’ Toure said with a smile. ‘At the end of the day, we could have gone with a draw but we are still there. We will do everything to win those two [group] games coming.

‘I’m ready for Chelsea. Any position, I am ready to fight for my club, I play from my heart, that is what is important. It doesn’t matter which players play we will give 100 per cent.’
