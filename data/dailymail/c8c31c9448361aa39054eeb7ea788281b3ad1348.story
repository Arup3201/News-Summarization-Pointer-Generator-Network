Some of Australia’s best known entertainers and celebrities from the showbiz world are joining the fight for clemency to be shown to Bali Nine pair Myarun Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.

Australian war artist Ben Quilty is the person behind the campaign requesting mercy from Indonesian authorities and has produced a star-studded video called I Stand For Mercy.

The video contains a number of contributions from famous Australians saying how upset they are and that the men’s lives should be spared. It features the likes of actors Asher Keddie, Bryan Brown and Claudia Karvan, musicians Missy Higgins and Megan Washington, and broadcasters Alan Jones and Andrew Denton.

Chan and Sukumaran face death by firing squad as early as next Sunday for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia, and their clemency bids have been ignored. 

Quilty became a mentor and close friend of Sukumaran after he was jailed, and has used his creative talents to create the powerful video in support of the two men.

'The message is just for the boys to know there are people walking with them in this very dark time,' Quilty told news.com.au. 

The 41-year-old is trying to organise a candlelight vigil for the pair, to 'send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.'

Richard Roxborough has also joined the I Stand For Mercy Campaign

'I want the barristers to walk into that prison and tell the boys how many people are thinking of them and supporting them,' he said. 

The 41-year-old has recruited dozens of renowned musicians to ‘perform for clemency’ and send a message that the death penalty is unacceptable.

“It’s for Myu and Andrew - I’d do anything for those two boys,” he said. 

'I want to send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.'

Co-founder of the Mercy Campaign, Brigid Delaney said the video highlighted the support for the two men on death row.

'It's amazing how much support the petition asking for clemency has received. We have more than 50,000 signatures, with thousands being added each day as the message of mercy spreads,' she said.

'This video is part of that campaign, respectfully asking the Indonesian government for mercy for Myuran and Andrew.'

A concert is also planned in Sydney on Thursday in support of the Mercy Campaign. Details on the event are still being finalised.

Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006

The families of Bali Nine ringleaders Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, have made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates.

On Thursday, Chan's last ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Widodo, following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia. 

The relatives of Chan and Sukumaran said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail.
