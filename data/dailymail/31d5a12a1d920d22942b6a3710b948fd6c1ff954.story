Jim Davidson could still make an appearance on Celebrity Big Brother after he was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences earlier this week.

Officers working on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation detained the comedian at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday as he flew into the UK ahead of a planned appearance on the reality TV show.

The 59-year-old pulled out of the Channel 5 programme's original lineup, which started on Wednesday, but it has been reported that he will enter the house following discussions with his advisors.

Return: Reports suggest that former BBC television host Jim Davidson could still make an appearance on Channel 5's Celebrity Big Brother after he pulled out of the show following an arrest by police working on the Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation

One source told the Daily Star: 'Jim is still in shock but hasn't done anything wrong and is determined to hold his head up high. He has vowed to clear his name.'

Following the arrest at Heathrow, having flown in from a Christmas break in Dubai, Davidson was taken to a London police station where he was questioned for a several hours.

He was released on bail until March.

Channel 5 is understood to have re-jigged its lineup at the last minute after talks with Davidson, replacing him with Neil 'Razor' Ruddock.

Davidson's solicitor said in a statement that the former television host 'vehemently denies' the allegations, said to date back 25 years.

In October Davidson, who formerly hosted BBC shows Big Break and The 
Generation Game, publicly labelled the Savile investigation a 'witch 
hunt'.

On his blog he wrote: 'The Savile witch hunt is going a bit silly now. 
We all are starting to speculate and accuse ... even in jest. So no, I 
don't know who's next.

'Everyone has had the nod. Everyone is an expert. Just pick someone you 
don't like and say it's them.

'As odd as he was, Savile can't defend 
himself. The bloke's dead for God's sake. Let's move on.'

A number of plain-clothed police officers spent more than four hours searching Davidson's Â£1million Georgian home in the picturesque village of Stockbridge in Hampshire.

They left the property at 7pm carrying boxes which appeared to contain plastic evidence bags and brown envelopes.

Davidson has often courted controversy by telling offensive jokes about ethnic minorities, homosexuals and the disabled.

He has divorced four times and in 2011 married his fifth wife, Michelle Cotton, 17 years his junior.

Following the arrest, his solicitor Henri Brandman said: 'Two women have made allegations in respect of Jim that date back approximately 25 years. The complainants were then in their mid-twenties.

'Jim vigorously denies the allegations. He answered police questions as fully as he was able after this passage of time.

Arrests: Davidson and an unnamed 53-year-old were on the same day  as police investigate accusations made in the wake of revelations about disgraced Jimmy Savile

'He has not been charged with any offence. Neither he nor I will be making any further comment.'

Another 53-year-old man was also arrested on the same day as Davidson. the pair are the ninth and tenth arrests made in the Savile investigation, called Operation Yewtree.

Detectives are working through an arrest list of people who could be questioned about allegations made by victims of Savile or others associated with him.

Scotland Yard said a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Savile so far.

And 589 people have come forward with information relating to the scandal, with a total of 450 complaints against the BBC presenter and DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse, police said.

Ten weeks after the launch of Operation Yewtree, police recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape.

Others who have been arrested include former pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr and publicist Max Clifford. Those three are on police bail.
