Prince George will never be smacked by his new ‘Spanish supernanny’ because her training forbids it, an expert has revealed.

New parents William and Kate are said to be 'delighted' that full-time nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo has joined their royal household.

But, it has been revealed the 43-year-old nanny would never smack a young child because her training at Norland College in Bath forbids it.

Prince George will never be smacked by his new 'Spanish supernanny' Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo because her training at Norland College in Bath forbids it, according to writer Louise Heren

The elite childcare training institute teaches its students that ‘a child is never naughty’ and would strike off any graduate who used physical punishment, according to writer Louise Heren.

Ms Heren spent a year making a TV documentary about Norland College and told the Daily Express: ‘They will never ever smack. They will be struck off if they do. A child is never naughty but the behaviour is.’

The institution's students are known for their distinctive uniforms and are schooled in all aspects of looking after youngsters during their three-year degree course.

With their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the start of more frequent public engagements, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were eager to secure an aide for Prince George

Norland College, founded in 1892 by Emily Ward, is a leading provider of childcare training.

Emily Ward introduced a uniform so Norland graduates needed to be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college's tradition.

The founder focused her training on the principles of Friedrich Froebel, the German educationalist who developed the 'kindergarten system'.

Its Early Childhood Studies course concentrates on numerous aspects of childhood.

Students study elements of social science, psychology, child health, history, literature and education.

It also trains its students - known as 'Norlanders' when they graduate - how to work with families, develop a child's math skills and become a whizz in the kitchen and teach a child not only how to cook, but how to cook healthy meals.

Along with the traditional skills of cooking, sewing and first aid, new subjects on the curriculum include Taekwondo, self defence, skidpan driving - and escaping from paparazzi. In the second year of the course, students learn from a stunt driver on the Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire who prepares them for all kinds of situations, from icy roads to potential kidnappers or paparazzi.

The training costs £36,000 in total 
and the Bath college recently added martial arts training and stunt 
driving to its curriculum to cater for modern clients - many of whom are
 celebrities and the super-rich.

Taekwondo
 is believed to be the martial art of choice - which has been specially 
adapted to include how to dodge a potential kidnapper with a pram.

Nannies
 are also trained in how to deal with paparazzi and are taken to Castle 
Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire to perfect their driving skills and 
learn how to drive at high speed in any weather condition. Driving away 
from pursuing photographers being the main reason for the training.

Ms Borrallo, who started working for the royal couple a few weeks but was only named on Thursday, has been getting to know Prince George, who is eight months old today. 

Ms Heren said: ‘If he is crawling, she will have worked out what has attracted his attention and move that beaker or toy a couple of yards further away each time.’

A Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed Ms Borrallo’s appointment and said she would be accompanying the Duke and Duchess on a forthcoming tour of New Zealand and Australia.

He said: 'Maria is a full-time nanny, 
who started work with us recently. We will not be giving further details
 on Maria or her employment, except to say that the Duke and Duchess are
 of course delighted she has chosen to join them.'

William and Kate have made it clear they intend to be hands-on parents.

They
 have often enlisted the help of Kate's mother Carole Middleton, as well
 as occasionally employing William's former nanny Jessie Webb.

However,
 with their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the 
start of more frequent public engagements, sources claimed the royal 
couple were eager to secure an aide.
