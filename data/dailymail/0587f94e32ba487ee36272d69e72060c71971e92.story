Found: Christopher Lee, 24 (pictured) has been arrested in Alaska on suspicion of killing his alleged lover, Erin Corwin

The alleged lover of a Marine's missing pregnant wife has been arrested in Alaska after her body was found at the bottom of an abandoned mine shaft in Southern California.

Christopher Brandon Lee, 24, was arrested on Sunday night in Anchorage on suspicion of killing Erin Corwin.

Lee, a married father-of-one and former Marine, is being held on a federal hold and will be extradited to California.

Authorities say Lee's wife, Nichole Lee, is a 'person of interest' in the death.

Corwin's body was found on Saturday afternoon at the bottom of a 140-foot-deep mine shaft several miles away from Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California, where she lived.The exact location is not known.

Her remains were identified on Sunday through dental records.

Corwin's death was ruled a homicide following an autopsy on Monday.

The 20-year-old was newly pregnant when she went missing on June 28.

She told her Marine husband Jonathan Corwin she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park, but never returned home.

Her Toyota Corolla was found two days later abandoned just blocks from the Twentynine Palms Marine Base.

Search and rescue teams scoured a 300-square-miles are around Joshua Tree National Park, including more than 100 mine shafts, for nearly two months before Corwin's body was found.

The investigation grew to focus on Lee, who was the Corwins' neighbor at the Marine Base, according to court papers.

Erin Corwin's friend told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair and that the unborn child might be Lee's, the papers show.

Married: Erin Corwin married Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin (pictured) two years ago, and they found out Erin was pregnant two weeks before she went missing

Nichole Lee

Corwin told her husband when she left 
on June 28 that she was going to scout out hiking trails that she and 
her mother could explore when her mother visited a few days later.

But
 the friend showed authorities text messages that said Corwin was 
planning to go on a special hunting trip with Lee the day she 
disappeared to celebrate.

'It is highly likely that Erin could have been harmed by an unknown firearm,' investigators wrote in the documents.

'Sometime
 after Erin left with Lee, her phone was deactivated (turned off). 
Detectives believe if Erin was injured and left at an undisclosed 
location, she would not (be) able to call for help.'

Scene

Scene: Members of the Urban Search and Rescue team from San Bernardino County's Sheriff's Department prepare to recover the body of Erin Corwin from an abandoned mine shaft near Twentynine Palms, California on Sunday. The body was found on Saturday

Scene: Erin Corwan's body was found at the bottom of a mine shaft several miles away from Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California where she lived. The exact location is unknown. She told her husband on the day she went missing that she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park

Other evidence was found in the shaft - one of more than 100 in the area - but San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon refused to disclose what that was.

Authorities also declined to release the manner of death.

Lee, a former Marine, told investigators he was not with Corwin the day she went missing and had been hunting in Joshua National Park.

He told police that although the two had kissed, they had never had intercourse.

Where the Corwins lived

Base: The Corwins lived at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms. Christopher Lee also lived at the base. Erin's abandoned car was found outside the site two days after she was reported missing

The investigation found that Lee and 
Corwin did have an 'intimate relationship' dating back to at least 
February, Sheriff's Sgt. Trevis Newport said.

Lee had reportedly volunteered at a horse ranch, White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch, with Corwin.

It
 wasn't immediately clear if Lee, who has yet to make a first court 
appearance or arrive in California, had retained an attorney.

Lee
 was arrested in July on suspicion of possessing a destructive device 
after a search warrant was served at his home in Yucca Valley.

Lee was taken into custody after the July 4 search and released on bail two days later.

He was honorably discharged after seven years in the Marine Corps (last serving as a rifleman in the Individual Ready Reserve) and subsequently moved his wife, Nichole, and daughter to Alaska.

Corwin and her husband are from Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

During the investigation, authorities interviewed Isabella Megli, the owner of White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch.

Megli said Lee's wife, Nichole Lee, made several comments to her about the investigation.

'Nichole told Isabella that without a body the detectives did not have a case against them and the detectives would never find the body,' the court documents said.

Nichole also said investigators had searched her residence but 'missed something' because they didn't go through the garage.

Erin Corwin

Victim: Authorities searched more than 100 mine shafts within a 300-square-mile radius of Twentynine Palms before finding Erin Corwin's body (pictured)

However Megli told The Desert Sun that she and Nichole were talking about something else.

Megli said she never suspected Corwin and Lee of having an affair.

Court documents also say police found a single 
set of shoe tracks at Corwin's abandoned vehicle at the marine base.

The tracks led from 
the driver side door of her Toyota and then disappeared next to a set of
 tire tracks.

The court document states that tracks found at the scene were 'consistent' with the tire tracks left by Lee's Jeep.Â
