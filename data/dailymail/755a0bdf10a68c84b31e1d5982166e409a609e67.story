Rio Ferdinand has accused John Terry of ‘stupidity’ over the racial insult he delivered to his brother Anton and has expressed his shock that the former England captain never apologised to either of them.

Ferdinand, once an England team-mate of Terry, became estranged from the centre-half when he clashed with Anton at a match between QPR and Chelsea in 2011. The FA ruled Terry had racially abused Anton, calling him a ‘******* black ****’.

And Ferdinand, who has spoken about the affair publicly for the first time in his autobiography #2Sides, serialised in The Sun on Sunday, said: ‘He never apologised to me or to Anton. And he has never hinted that he has ever had a moment of understanding over the damage his stupidity had inflicted on everyone.’

Ferdinand and Terry, who were England centre-back partners together, no longer speak and the former Manchester United skipper says he cannot forgive the Chelsea captain for what he said and did and put his family through.

He added: ‘For me, the biggest idiot will always be John Terry. As England captain and my centre-back partner he could have saved everyone a lot of pain by admitting immediately he used the word in the heat of the moment, but was not racist.

‘I think that's probably what happened and what the truth is. Anton and I would've accepted that – instead he never gave us a chance.

‘That was the betrayal. He tried to run away from what he had done.'

Fedinand also revealed that the incident, which happened back in 2011, took its toll on his family with his mother having her windows smashed in, bullets in the post and was eventually admitted to hospital with stress.
