A bride-to-be whose terminally ill mother would not live to see her walk down the aisle fulfilled her final wish - by wearing her wedding dress to her hospital bedside.

Grandmother Nelly Bullock, 70, had always wanted to see her beloved Lisa, 43, tie the knot with fiance Rob Hoskins.

The couple had been together 27 years but had always put off getting married while they raised their five children.

Her dream come true: The touching moment that Lisa Bullock donned her wedding dress to visit her terminally ill mother Nelly Bullock in hospital because she won't live to see her walk down the aisle

They had planned to wed on September 7 and Nelly had already bought her shoes and outfit ready for the big day.

But she was struck down by Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD ) - a form of the degenerative brain disorder that had been linked to Mad Cow Disease.

Her conditioned worsened so Lisa made the heart-breaking decision to show her former market trader mother the dress before it was too late.

Full-time mother Lisa, of Matson, Glos., was so desperate for her mother to see her dress that she donned the gown to visit her in Gloucester Royal Hospital.

The happy couple: Lisa and Rob had been together 27 years but had always put off getting married while they raised their five children. They had planned to wed on September 7 and Nelly had already bought her shoes and outfit for the couple's big day

Big family: Lisa Bullock, her fiance Robert Hoskins and their children Tom Hoskins, 19, Ellie-Mae Hoskins, 2, Sam Hoskins, 23, Jessica Hoskins,18, and Alfie Jack Hoskins, 6

She said: 'It was so incredibly emotional when I went to the hospital in my dress.

In her youth: Nelly was tragically struck downby Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD ) - a form of the degenerative brain disorder that had been linked to Mad Cow Disease so Lisa showed her the dress before it was too late

'I did get a few funny looks though.

'There
was no way I would get married if I couldn't show my mum the lovely 
dress, especially because she paid half towards its cost.

'I really wanted her to see me in my dress so I went to the hospital wearing it before she died.

'She could see me wearing it but couldn't say anything. I'm just glad that I did that for her.

'It was so sudden and so sad. Now me and my three brothers have to wait weeks for test results to see if we carry the gene that could mean we would get the same condition.

'I'm at my wit's end.'

Lisa and childhood sweetheart Rob, a plasterer, have three boys, Sam, 23, Tom, 19, and Alfie-Jack, six, and daughters Jessica, 18, and Ellie-Mae, two.

She said: 'Rob and I met when we were 16 and 17, and have been together ever since.

'My parents were childhood sweethearts too, which makes it all the more special.

'We kept meaning to get married, but one thing after another, with work and kids and that, meant that we just kept putting it off until this year.

I'm so excited, I just with my mum could be there to see it.'
