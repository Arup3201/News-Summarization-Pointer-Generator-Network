Mikaeel’s mother Rosie Kular, 33, was brought up in a detached house in an upmarket part of Edinburgh.

Her father Gurbux, who was from India, died aged just 43 when she was in her teens.

Her mother Harjinder, 60, has since married twice, most recently to Dr Bangarpet Krishnaswamy, 69, a GP originally from Bangalore, who also develops properties in Scotland.

He is the director of East Neuk Healthcare, which owns a 40-bed nursing home in Anstruther, Fife.

The
 family live in a large two-storey detached home on a small upmarket 
estate, with a navy Jaguar and dark blue Volvo parked in front of the 
property.

After studying at 
comprehensive Balwearie High School in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Miss Kular went 
to Fife College and graduated with an HND in beauty therapy, which she 
now uses to run her own mobile health and beauty studio.

She works full time and has also been listed as a director at an IT company.

For a time she was a customer services assistant with a gas company.

At 24, and heavily pregnant, she married Omotoso Adekoya, a Nigerian taxi driver who had originally come to the UK to study.

Three
 months later she gave birth to son Tarun, their first of three children
 born in four years. David was born in 2006 and daughter Renuka came 
two years later.

Among Miss Kular's friends was Mohammed Omar Abdi, 25, who was killed in a gang gun battle in Edinburgh last year. Both pictured, above

The 
relationship broke down, however, and although the couple are not 
divorced Mr Adekoya lives in an apartment near Miss Kular in Edinburgh.

His
 mother said he is a ‘gentle person’ who was so devastated  by the 
breakdown of his  marriage that he has not met anyone since.

By
 2010, Miss Kular gave birth to her fourth and fifth children – twins 
Mikaeel and Ashika, who have had no contact since with their Pakistani 
father.

Among Miss Kular’s 
friends was Mohammed Omar Abdi, 25, who was killed in a gang gun battle 
in Edinburgh last year.

Abdi, the son of a senior Muslim cleric, was 
often seen at Miss Kular’s family home and posed in pictures with her on
 Facebook.

After studying at comprehensive Balwearie High School in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Miss Kular went to Fife College and graduated with a HND in beauty therapy, which she now uses to run her own mobile health and beauty studio

He was gunned down during a high-speed chase between two rival gangs in the early hours  last May.

Abdi
 was facing drugs charges at the time after officers found a  
‘significant quantity’ of crack cocaine and cash during a raid.  Six men
 face trial accused of  killing him.

Miss
 Kular, in one online posting, says of herself: ‘Just me, myself and 
I... oh yeah, with a brood of five monsters, six if you count the man 
indoors!’

In another, she adds: ‘Work full time which is a bit crapiola but it’s got to be done eh!’

Miss
 Kular links to various groups promoting local parties and DJs on 
Facebook, and writes on Twitter that ‘boring is only a state of mind’.

After a busy evening a couple of years ago, she posted: ‘I’m good, slightly hungover lol but nothing I can’t handle.’

And in another online message, she said she was ‘still alive... just!' 

Members of the public assist the police with the search in the Silverknowes area of Edinburgh for missing three-year-old boy Mikaeel Kular yesterday
