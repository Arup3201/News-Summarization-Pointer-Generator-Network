Journalist Nick Ames was in the press box at the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade on Tuesday and witnessed the chaotic scenes which led to the abandonment of the Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania.

Perhaps I should have known better, but as Serbia vs Albania neared half-time I had started thinking to myself that the evening had, after all, gone off in relative calm.

Sure, you could not hear a single note of the Albanian national anthem above the whistles and howls; sure, you didn’t need too big a Serbian vocabulary to know that the chants from the ultras just below Partizan Stadium’s press box were about as colourful as it gets. 

But, a couple of chances for the visiting side apart, Serbia had controlled the first half and – with no away fans in the stadium – there seemed little scope for trouble unless the visitors took a shock lead.

Albanian fans were banned from attending the match between the two Balkan rival nations, due to the turbulent relations between the two. 

These have mainly surrounded the over the former ethnic Albanian-dominated Serbian province of Kosovo.

Kosovo declared independence in 2008, but this is not recognised by Serbia.

NATO waged a 78-day air war in 1999 to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces fighting a two-year counter-insurgency war.

Seven of Albania's squad were born in the Kosovo region. 

This was a game that had set the alarm bells ringing from the off, though. Serbia and Albania have a fraught and uneasy recent history, centring around Kosovo – the largely ethnic Albanian-populated territory that declared independence from Serbia in 2008. 

Tensions are high. UEFA had stepped in to settle a dispute between the two FAs about away ticketing, advising that nobody should travel, and the scope for flashpoints seemed thin on the ground.

Unless somebody came up with something unexpected, surreal and quite remarkable. Just as I began musing on the unremarkable nature of it all, thinking to tweet my impressions at the break play was stopped by Martin Atkinson – the English referee may never have another night like this – because a flare had been thrown in the direction of an Albanian throw-in taker. 

It was cleared from the pitch quickly enough; the delay, though, took longer than usual and it was only upon a glance upwards that the reason became apparent.

A small craft was hovering just above the pitch, visible against the floodlights on a dark, clear night and parallel to the top of the stand. Strange enough, but what was gradually bringing the crowd to fever pitch as it came to their attention proved to be the spark inside the tinderbox. 

The red and black flag, the familiar figure of an eagle in the centre, depicted ‘Greater Albania’ – an idea encompassing the area of the Balkans in which ethnic Albanians reside.

The double-headed eagle, as featured on the Albanian flag, is imposed upon so-called 'Greater Albania' where ethnic Albanians live.

The word 'Autochthonous' refers to Serbia's alleged attempts to control Kosovo despite not being indigenous to the region.

The man on the left is Ismail Qemal, founder of the Albanian national movement, and of the modern Albanian state as its first head of state and government.

On the right is Isa Boletini, a nationalist figure who fought in the Albanian Revolt in Kosovo in 1910 and later in World War I against Serbia.

All the same, when Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic leapt up to catch the flag, which had sunk from the sky as the seemingly remote-controlled drone dropped with it, it seemed a sensible enough thing to do. Take it to the sidelines, get it off the pitch, get on with the game. It had been a surreal, almost filmlike sequence and an act of stunning provocation – but there was time to salvage matters.

But Albania’s players wanted their flag and, after Andi Lila and Taulant Xhaka had wrestled Mitrovic for it, it ended up in the hands of striker Bekim Balaj – well known for scoring a superb winner against Portugal last month.

What followed was a blur, a rush and swirl of people and movements that I was only able to piece together correctly upon returning from the stadium. At the time, it was impossible to believe your eyes: in years of covering football at home and abroad, nothing had come close to this. 

As Balaj made to leave the field, substitutes and officials from both sides had entered the fray – joined, somehow, by fans who had found it surprisingly easy to burst the massed ranks of police.

One supporter made for Balaj with a chair; he was wrestled to the ground by Lorik Cana, the Albanian captain and ex-Sunderland player, who detained him there for a almost a minute while chaos unfolded around him. 

Another, entering the pitch from the other side, made for visiting players too. This unholy mix of players, staff, police and fans piled in – and for a moment you had no idea where it would end.

It did come to a close, eventually, when the Albanian players made a run for the players’ tunnel in the south-east corner. This was always going to be the lesser of several evils, but it didn’t stop the being pelted with missiles from the Serbian ultras – stationed in that very corner, right below my seat in the press box, and set upon by another pitch invader.

As they crouched and ran, hands over their faces, a Serbian official could be seen covering his own in evident despair a little behind them. His countrymen left the field in orderly fashion shortly afterwards, but the damage – and Serbia has some previous – may have been done despite the obvious act of provocation.

We waited for news. It came, 15 minutes or so later, that the match would continue. By now, the ranks of police separating stands from pitch were three or four deep; a presence whose like I have never witnessed at any sporting event. 

Out came Serbia manager Dick Advocaat and a few of his substitutes a little after that; in they came again shortly afterwards. The south stand had been partly cleared by then, and something appeared to be up. Sure enough, news filtered through that Atkinson had abandoned the match.

Serbia emerged from the tunnel anyway, moving to the centre circle and applauding the fans who remained. But there was little to applaud in Belgrade on Tuesday night. An event that had been given every opportunity to pass peacefully had ended in turmoil whose repercussions may be felt beyond football. 

Few supporters remained outside an eerily quiet ground when I finally left an hour later. All was calm again but, just as had been the case before Atkinson stopped play, that told none of the story.
