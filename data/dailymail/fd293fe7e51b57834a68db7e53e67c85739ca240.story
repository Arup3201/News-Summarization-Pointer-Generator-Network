Webcam girls are paid to strip off and put on erotic shows for internet viewers, and they make quite the comfortable living doing it.

According to BetaBeat, one of the most popular cam girls - who goes by LittleRedBunny - rakes in $4.99 per minute. Top earners like her can end up making an impressive $1million a year, says a Jasmin.com spokesperson.

While some of the pay comes from free chat rooms, where the women dance on camera in a 'public area,' the real money is earned through private sessions in which viewers pay extra by the minute while the camgirl indulges their personal fantasy.

LittleRedBunny, who claims to be a New Yorker and yet speaks with a heavy French accent, has  been camming for five years and is one of the best-paid LiveJasmin stars.

She justifies her expensive price tag by explaining just how hard she has to work for it, sometimes performing in private sessions that last up to 19 hours.

'I know some girls [ask for tips],' she said. 'I feel like it's like begging, personally. I just have fun, and I give myself 100 percent in free chat. I never ask for tips… what's important is [viewers] have a good time.'

KatieKays, a 19-year-old student studying early childhood development, launched her camming career a year ago. She charges $2.99 per minute for her shows, and 'a couple dollars extra' if the viewers want to chat to her.

'Sometimes I get tips in free chat because people like to,' she said. 'I don't ask for tips or anything. I just try to get to know people and care about their lives and stuff, and I guess I get rewarded.'

Despite their impressive paychecks, both women say they are acutely aware that theirs is not a sustainable lifetime career.

'[Camming]'s
 not something you can do forever, so to me, you've got to be smart 
about it,' said LittleRedBunny, explaining that she saves most of her money and uses some of it to fund her career.

'You don't know what you're going to do 
after - [you might make] much less, and you might end up in trouble,' she added.

Perfectly content: While keeping mum about exactly how much she earns each year, KatieKays said: 'I make a decent living. It puts me through college without student loans'

Another obstacle that keeps them from overspending is keeping the details of their work private from family members.

For now, however, both LittleRedBunny and KatieKays are perfectly content with the way things are.
