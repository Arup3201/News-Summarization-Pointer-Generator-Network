When it comes to feeling the pressure to lose those extra pounds ahead of summer, it is not just women feeling the heat.

According to the latest research, almost half of men claim they diet in preparation for a holiday.

According to the survey over a third of men say they feel stressed at the thought of having to show their body on the beach.

The terminator: Nearly half of men are embarking on pre-holiday diets to shape up and vote Arnold Schwarzenegger as having a great beach body

The pressure proves too much for some, 
with 10 per cent admitting to the drastic action of cancelling a 
holiday, or staying in the UK, because they just couldn't bear to bare. 
Surprisingly, just 5 per cent of women polled said that they had taken 
the same action.

Peer pressure and the views of others are the main reasons for men feeling uncomfortable with stripping off, as over a quarter of men polled said they worried others would judge them.

Almost a fifth said they didn't want to be reminded of their appearance in holiday photos when back on these shores.

Other results from the survey showed that it's not just other men that blokes look to compete with, as over one in ten say they pit themselves against their partner to see who can lose the most weight ahead of going on holiday, while just 7 per cent of women admit to comparing themselves with their other half.

With the pressure from celebrities, and partners higher than ever, it's no surprise that half of men now feel as much pressure as women to diet and stay in shape.

Are they crazy? Arnold Schwarzenegger, best known for his muscles in The Terminator, received more votes for best beach body than supermodel David Gandy

On the other hand, women still believe they are under more stress, with 55 per cent believing the expectation was more on them to look their best.

Favourite celebrity beach body was something that both genders agreed on as David Beckham took top spot with both men and women.

However, proving he still has a body that grabs the public's attention, Arnold Schwarzenegger, best known for his muscles in The Terminator, received more votes for best beach body than supermodel David Gandy.

Equally both men and woman pinpoint 
the stomach as the most troublesome area to shift weight from with 60 
per cent and 55 per cent respectively saying they found it the hardest 
part of the body to tone up.

However, 4 per cent of men polled said their pecs were their main 
concern and the area they struggled with the most, with thighs, arms and
face also proving tricky spots.

And, proving that the recent cold winter has long lasting effects, over a tenth of men said they were more nervous than previous years to show off their beach body this summer.

'The results of the research definitely show a shift in men's attitude towards their image and there is definitely more pressure in terms of them feeling like they need to match up to their partner's expectations', said a spokesman for Withings, Minh Lê, who carried out the research.

'There's no doubting the influence of celebrity culture and images of buff beach bodies in the media, and more men are now taking everyday health and fitness measures to stay in shape.'
