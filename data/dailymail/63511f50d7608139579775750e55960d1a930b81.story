An OAP attacked his wife when she switched channels during an 'exciting' cricket match, a court has heard.

Bryan Wright admitted assaulting his wife of almost 30 years, Lillian, at their home last month after the row over the remote control.

His own barrister told Darlington Magistrates' Court: 'He had been watching cricket all afternoon, it was an exciting match, in the final overs.

'He went out of the room, came back, and the channel had changed.  He saw red and acted completely inappropriately.'

The assault happened while Wright was believed to be watching an IPL 20-over match broadcast on ITV4 between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils which went right to the wire.

The 72-year-old grabbed his wife by the collar of her dressing gown, prosecutor Joanne Hesse told the court yesterday.

She said: 'Lillian turned the channel over when he left the room and this resulted in a verbal altercation.

'He forced her up from her seat, repeatedly swearing at her, saying "I will kill you".

Wright pleaded guilty to the assault, but disputed the prosecution's version of events.

He told police that he felt the 
channel-changing had been unfair, and insisted he had neither hit her 
with the remote control nor threatened to kill her.

Mrs Hesse said: 'The prosecution would suggest that there was a weapon used, namely the remote control, however there was a lack of pre-meditation.'

Mrs Wright fled to a neighbour's house, after which police were called and her husband was arrested.

Tracey Kyle, mitigating, said: 'This was an act of domestic violence and while there were no injuries, it still would have been very frightening for Mrs Wright and he accepts that.'

She added that the couple, who had not long got back together at the time of the assault on April 16, were now separated with no plans to reconcile.

Wright, of Darlington, was given a three-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.
