The shroud of secrecy over Google's mysterious barge project has finally been lifted after their blueprints were exposed today, offering a first glimpse inside the floating tech palaces.

The three floating tech palaces sparked a fever of speculation after they appeared at in San Francisco Bay and Portland, Maine, last month.

But new documents today shed light on how they may look and definitively link the structures to the internet giant.

The documents were released under the US Freedom of Information Act and provide 
details about the barge in San Francisco, describing it as a 13,726 
square-foot 'studios', able to move between different locations.

Fish fins: The vessel in San Francisco will have sails made to resemble 'fish fins' to remind visitors that they are on a 'seaworthy vessel' although the barge itself will be powered by large diesel motors

Inside: Google hopes to turn the four story barges into tourist attractions, housing atriums, 'welcoming areas', exhibition spaces and 'support facilities'

Earlier this week Google revealed they would be used for educational purposes.

‘A floating data center? A wild party boat? A barge housing the last remaining dinosaur? Sadly, none of the above,’ a Google spokesman told TechCrunch.

‘Although it’s still early days and things may change, we’re exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.’

Such is the level of 
secrecy surrounding the project - said to be overseen by Google founder 
Sergey Brin himself and his Google X team - even members of the Coast 
Guard have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements along with the 
teams of engineers and welders who have been working there.

The Daily Telegraph reported that, rather than 'party boats' or data centers, Google hopes to turn the four story barges into tourist attractions, housing atriums, 'welcoming areas', exhibition spaces and 'support facilities'.

Traveling Google: It said the San Francisco barge will have a temporary exhibition area that Google will be able to travel around the US for a two-year period

'We believe this curious and visually stunning structure that will be a welcome addition to the waterfront; an experience unlike any other that celebrates community, local organisations and the history of the San Francisco Bay,' the documents say.

Clone: Hasty construction began this week on a second Google barge off Treasure Island, San Francisco

Going up! The barge's four-level structure is being prepared on the land before it will be placed on top - like it's neighbor

Thinking
outside the box: These containers were being prepared to be put onto 
the second barge - but Google wouldn't say what the boats will be used for 
sparking rampant speculation

It adds: 'We envisage this space with community in mind – a surprint environment that is accessible to all and inspires conversation about how everything is connected – shore birds, me, you, the sea, fog and much more.'

The vessel will be staffed by 50 people, including 37 "technology 
demonstration associates".

Permit applications submitted to the Port of San Francisco for By and Large, the barges' registered owners, explicitly name Google as By and Large's owners.

Google anticipates having approximately 1,000 visitors a day on the vessel 
according to the documents, but that it could also be used for private 
events after 10pm at night.

It will also be staffed by security guards 24/7 while some 50 CCTV cameras will monitor all activity inside.
