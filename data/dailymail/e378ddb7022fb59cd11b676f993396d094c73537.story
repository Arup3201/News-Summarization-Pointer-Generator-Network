The cost of David Moyes' disastrous year at Manchester United became clear when the club revealed the financial repercussions of not playing European football this season.

United released their financial quarterly results for the three months ending on September 30 at lunchtime on Tuesday, revealing a £9.8million drop in income due to the fact they are not participating in the Champions League or even the Europa League this season.

Commercial, broadcasting and matchday revenue came to £98.5million for the same period last year. This time that figure is down 9.9 per cent to £88.7m.

United's debt is also seen to be up slightly from £361m to £362.2m although the club has been quick to point out that the last quarter has also seen them sign the largest kit manufacturer deal in sport - £750m over 10 years – amid five other sponsorship deals across the globe.

United also boosted their playing squad with the signing of Daley Blind, Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo and Radamel Falcao in the closing days of the summer transfer window.

Chief executive Ed Woodward said: 'While we recognize that the 2014-15 fiscal year financial results will reflect our absence from the Champions League, we signed the largest kit sponsorship deal in the history of sport in the first quarter and, with that concluded, we are excited to focus our efforts on the meaningful growth opportunities in sponsorship, digital media and retail and merchandising.'

In the literature accompanying their results, United revealed that they expect their overall revenues for the whole financial year 2015 to be between £385m and £395m, a drop of about £40m.

United finished seventh in the Barclays Premier League last season, with Moyes being sacked in April less than a year in to a six-year contract.

A breakdown of the last quarter’s revenue falls show that commercial income fell £3.1m (5.2 per cent), broadcasting £2.5m (13 per cent) and matchday £4.2m (21.8 per cent).

Meanwhile, net player expenditure over the three month period was £55.9m, an increase of £29.1m and indicative of the amount of rebuilding current manager Louis van Gaal is having to make to his playing squad.
