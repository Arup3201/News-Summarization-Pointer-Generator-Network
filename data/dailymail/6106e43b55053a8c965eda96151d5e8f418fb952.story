Given that he has is caught up in one of the world's most high-stakes divorce battles, you might expect Belgian hotelier Didier Thiry to be slightly on edge.

And this week, the stakes grew even higher when a judge sentenced him to four months in prison for hiding his millions from his estranged wife, fashion designer Alisa Thiry.

But his response could barely be more blasé - the businessman says he won't return to Britain because he won't be able to get a good cup of coffee in jail.

Defiant: Didier Thiry, left, refuses to return to Britain after his wife Alisa, right, managed to have him jailed

Mr Thiry is a well-known figure in his native country thanks to his flourishing hospitality empire, including a boutique hotel in Brussels and a decades-old restaurant in a quaint village.

However, this week he hit the headlines thanks to his acrimonious divorce battle, which has seen him and his wife squabbling over their £45million fortune.

The key bone of contention is a £13.8million loan a company owned by Alisa made to a company owned by Didier.

Naturally, now the couple are no longer together, Alisa wishes her loan to be repaid.

Alisa Thiry received £40m from her first husband and wants her second jailed for concealing assets

At a 
hearing of the Family Division of the High Court on Wednesday, Alisa’s 
barrister - at her behest - said Mr Thiry was in contempt of court for 
failing to disclose information relating to this loan and urged the 
judge to jail him.

The judge agreed, and sentenced Mr Thiry, 52, to four months in jail.

But he is currently in Belgium, and is in no mood to come rushing back to Britain to serve his sentence.

'I
 can’t come to London,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You don’t know 
what it is for me not to go to London and be condemned to jail.'

Although
 he refuses to discuss the details of the court case, he claims to have 
launched rival proceedings in Belgium against Alisa.

And
 he retains a refreshingly light-hearted attitude to his own plight, 
concluding: 'Who would want to come to England anyway? The coffee is 
terrible, especially in prison I guess.'

On the face of it, former magazine fashion editor Alisa, 49, has done very well for herself.

Her first split from Stephen Marks, the founder of the French Connection fashion empire, in 2004, was resolved relatively smoothly.

To pay off Alisa, Mr Marks dutifully sold £40million worth of shares in his company and she subsequently received a settlement somewhere in the region of that amount.

And after the judge's ruling about Didier, one might expect 49-year-old Alisa to have felt quietly satisfied when she returned to her £15 million property, a five-storey house in one of Notting Hill’s grander terraces.

After getting husband No 1 to hand over a fortune, she’s managed to get No 2 banged up in prison. That, surely, is a first.

Except it isn’t quite as simple as that. Their divorce is far from settled — millions remain at stake.

And the battle between this warring couple is about to become even bloodier than it already is.

The news that Alisa Thiry is now embroiled in a second epic divorce battle involving many millions of pounds has been met with little surprise in certain quarters among their circle.

Indeed, there are unkind mutterings that Alisa is a woman who weighs up a potential husband’s suitability according to the size of his wallet.

‘It didn’t go unnoticed that she took Stephen to the cleaners,’ says one who knows her.

‘She told her friends she was going to take him for everything she could — and she did. He was devastated. There are no feelings of warmth between Alisa and Stephen now —  just loathing.

‘No one was surprised when Alisa married another multi-millionaire. She has an uncanny way of latching on to money. I think Didier was probably warned, but sadly paid no attention.’

The couple were married overseas around 2006. Following their separation, it is understood a decree nisi was  issued, but a decree absolute cannot be given until a financial settlement has been agreed.

The High Court hearing heard that Mr Thiry had a fortune of £8million when their relationship began. A large chunk of the  couple’s combined fortune is made up of the money Alisa took from her first divorce.

How ironic — and a sort of poetic justice for Stephen Marks — if she lost it all in the second.

The couple’s assets include the house in Notting Hill and a luxurious property on the Caribbean island of St Barts, where Alisa and Didier first met not long after her divorce from Mr Marks in 2004.

The daughter of Raymond Chapman and his wife, Valerie, both hairdressers, she has certainly adjusted well to the lifestyle into which she has been propelled by virtue of her marriages.

She was born Alisa Chapman in Cheltenham in 1964 but changed her name to Green after her mother’s marriage to Ronald Green in 1973.

Alisa met Stephen Marks in 1989 at the launch of the short-lived Mirabella magazine. He is said to have been so smitten that he proposed that very evening. She was 25 and single. He was 20 years older, with a daughter from a long-term relationship with the fashion designer Nicole Farhi.

The 49-year-old former magazine fashion editor walked away with an eight-figure settlement after splitting from Mr Marks, the co-founder of French Connection, in 2004 after the couple had three children together

And after founding the French Connection fashion label in 1969, he was already fabulously rich.

Following their marriage in 1993, the couple had three children, Ella, now 19, Joshua, 17, and Ava, 12, and set up home in The Boltons in West London — one of the capital’s most rarefied addresses, where Alisa enjoyed giving lavish dinner parties. The family had holidays at their homes on St Barts and at The Hamptons outside New York.

In the mid-Nineties, French Connection launched a new slogan — FCUK.

The controversy it caused gave the company acres of free publicity and French Connection flourished.

Mr Marks’s fortune was said to be £300 million.

They were friends with Madonna and Sting.

But in 2004 it emerged that Alisa had left the marital home, taking the children with her.

Later that year, Mr Marks was forced to sell the £40 million worth of shares, reducing his stake in his company from 51 per cent to just over 40 per cent, to fund his divorce.

Yesterday, Mr Marks declined to comment about his ex-wife’s divorce proceedings.

But a French Connection spokesman told me that he did wish to point out that his wife had never been a ‘creative director’ at French Connection — as she is described on her internet LinkedIn site, which allows business people to network online — but was simply a stylist.

She continues to maintain she was.

It has been said in the past that the FCUK advertising masterstroke had something to do with Alisa, but the spokesman confirmed yesterday that this was not so either.

What is true, however, is that the divorce left Mr Marks well and truly in the doldrums.

The same year as the divorce, French Connection announced a severe profits warning and Mr Marks admitted: ‘I suppose if someone has a difficult time personally, they might not be quite as focused as they were before.’

Post divorce, it was reported that Alisa formed a friendship with a French photographer, Jean-Philippe Piter, then 35, living on St Barts.

M Piter was said to be not especially keen on hard work, with a liking for wealthy women.

One associate reportedly said of him: ‘Here on St Barts, people say that he works not with his brain but his beautiful body.’

Alisa was said to enjoy listening to him playing his guitar. But their relationship seemingly never took off and soon Alisa was introduced to Didier.

After their marriage, they divided their time between London, Brussels and St Barts, living for the most part in the house in Notting Hill that Alisa bought with the proceeds from her divorce settlement.

In 2009, she and Didier bought an art nouveau townhouse in Brussels and turned it into a boutique hotel, the Hotel Odette.

Alisa presided over the interior decoration and decided that a black and white theme would be just perfect.

So the carpets are black, the doors are black and in the library a  black and white TV plays black and white Fellini films on a continuous silent loop.

Alisa’s other big design project was the house in St Barts that she and Didier moved into in 2010.

It’s fair to say Alisa will be unwilling to let Didier have this property. It was built especially for her, according to her own vision, a fabulous, minimalistic shangri-la overlooking the sea.

Alisa gave an interview to a magazine about the conception of the house, accompanied by photographs of her wearing a bikini and a mahogany tan.

‘It was an easy feat to design this house,’ she said, ‘given the surrounding beauty.’ (And a little help from three architects.)

‘I tried to incorporate natural elements in the flow of the house, primarily the wonderful light, the reflection of the sea and the welcome breeze.

‘This house is all about the sea, the sea and the light.

For me, the ultimate luxury is taking a shower while being able to look out to the sea — that is complete freedom.’

It is, indeed.

But as painful as it may be, it is possible that Alisa may not be able to shower while looking out to sea for much longer, if Didier gets the house as part of the settlement.

What caused the split is not clear.

A source says: ‘Alisa can be quite difficult. She’s very hard-nosed and money-oriented and a real man’s woman, not at all soft. Perhaps Didier just had enough.’

For now the wrangling goes on.

And how much of her fortune Alisa may lose is not yet known. But even if her ex-husband is awarded a big slice of it, all is not lost.

Given Alisa’s proven record for attracting multi-millionaires, who could rule out another one coming her way and becoming husband number three?
