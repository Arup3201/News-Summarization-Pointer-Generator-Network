More than $1,000 has been raised to care and re-house a severely matted Shih Tzu which was abandoned in a Los Angels parking lot on Christmas Eve.

A man seen on surveillance video leaving the dog neat a Walgreen store in San Fernando came forward yesterday saying he had rescued the dog which was running in traffic and was not abandoning it.

He reportedly found the dog, since named Ralphie, running in and out of traffic and claims he was trying to be a Good Samaritan by leaving it in the car park.

The man, who has not been named, had feared Ralphie would be struck by traffic, Ktla.com reported.

According to animal rescue officials the dog was dirty, matted and starving.  

A couple feeding cats later found Ralphie and were able to capture him. The dog was then handed over to independent animal rescuer Hailey Moss.

Ms Moss said Ralphie had been groomed and is now in a short-term foster home.
