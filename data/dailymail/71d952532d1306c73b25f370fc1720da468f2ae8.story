A Tennessee judge will today decide whether a dog lives or dies.

Beau, a golden retriever/German Shepherd mix, was ordered to be put down after he killed a duck and nearly attacked a little boy in Dyersburg two months ago, according to city officials.

His owner, Danny Higgins, who was out of town at the time of the alleged attack, won a 30-day delay in his pet's euthanasia on October 21.

The extension is due to expire today, with a judge set to make a final ruling.

'My attorneys tell me that we will go to the Supreme Court if we have to,' Mr Higgins told News Channel 3.

'He is not vicious.

'I don’t want the vicious dog (label) put on him because he is not.'

In previous hearings on the matter, a judge told Higgins he can keep Beau if he complies with the city's vicious dog ordinance.

But Higgins says he doesn't have the money needed to comply.

He also has the option to adopt his dog out to someone in another state, but says he doesn't want to give away his best friend.

Police were first called to Higgins' trailer park home on September 19, 2014, around 6.20 pm.
