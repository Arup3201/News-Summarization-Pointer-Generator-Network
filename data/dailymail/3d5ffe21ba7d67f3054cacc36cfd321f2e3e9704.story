They were among the most feared killing machines of World War One, causing the deaths of thousands of servicemen at sea.

So when the people of Hastings woke one morning to see this German U-boat on their beach, it caused something of a shock.

These eerie pictures show how the horrors of war got a little bit too close to home for the people of the Sussex town.

Frightening: In 1919, this German U-boat caused something of a commotion among the people of Hastings after it beached in the Sussex town

Washed-up: The U-boat, number 118, had been surrendered on February 23 1919 - exactly one year after it was launched

Damage: The type two boat was due to be transferred to France but the tow parted and she went aground off Hastings on April 15

The U-boat, number 118, was surrendered on February 23, 1919 - exactly one year after it was launched.

The type two boat was due to be transferred to France 
but the tow parted and she went aground off the Sussex coast two months later - this was despite the attempts of a French destroyer to break her up with gunfire.

Thousands of people flocked to the 
seafront near the Queens Hotel to catch a glimpse of the killing machine.

Eventually, it became so popular that the town clerk started charging people a small fee to be allowed on 
board.

Interest: Thousands of people flocked to the seafront to catch a glimpse of the boat

Killing machine: The type two boat was built in the Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg and was launched on February 23 1918

Captured: Under the command of Herbert Strohwasser, U-118 managed to sink two ships while on its one and only patrol before being surrendered on February 23 1919

The U-boat campaign of World War One took place largely in the seas surrounding the British Isles and Mediterranean.

U-boats were used mainly by German commanders to block the trade routes of the British forces.

The German Empire needed imports for domestic food production while the UK relied on imports to feed the population.

Both also need materiel to supply their war industry, sparking huge battles to block each others trade routes.

The Germans used the U-boat as a way of fighting back against the Royal Navy, which was far superior in size and could operate almost anywhere, unlike the German Navy surface fleet.

During World War One, U-boats were responsible for sinking about 5,000 ships and killing about 5,000 men in combat.

The proceeds went towards the Mayor's Fund for the welcome home of the troops which was planned later that year.

But residents soon grew sick of children pelting the boat with rocks 
and making a racket throughout the night and the order was  eventually given to break 
her up.

Parts of U-118 were then snatched and dispersed all over Hastings.

The town itself was presented with the submarine's gun but it was buried in the shingle by wave action.

Although
recovered again in 1921 it was disposed of despite calls for it to be 
mounted on a plinth and kept as a permanent reminder of the event.

The boat was built in the Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg and was launched on February 23 1918.

Under
the command of Herbert Strohwasser, U-118 managed to sink two ships 
while on its one and only patrol before it was surrendered on February 23,
1919 - exactly one year after it was launched.

Frustrating: As residents grew sick of children pelting the boat with rocks and making a racket throughout the night, the order was given to break her up

Ripped apart: After the order was given to break her up, parts of U-118 were snatched and dispersed all over Hastings

Gift: The town was presented with the submarine's gun but it was later buried in the shingle
