To an almost audible sound of thousands of hearts breaking in two, Benedict Cumberbatch has announced that he is off the market.

The man widely seen as the most desired thespian in the world — despite looks that he himself compares to both an otter and Shergar the racehorse — has made it known that he is engaged to his girlfriend, Sophie Hunter.

In a bare, if momentous, paragraph in the Forthcoming Marriages section of The Times, the dreaded news was delivered: ‘Mr B. T Cumberbatch and Miss S. I Hunter. The engagement is announced between Benedict, son of Wanda and Timothy Cumberbatch of London and Sophie, daughter of Katharine Hunter of Edinburgh and Charles Hunter of London.’

Cue mourning from millions of adoring women around the world — the ‘Cumberbitches’, as they are known, or, as Benedict prefers it, ‘Cumberpeople’. ‘I think [that name] sets feminism back so many notches,’ he once said.

One fan offered: ‘On one hand I’m so happy for him and for her. . . she gets to have this wonderful man, she can wake up next to him, kiss him and see his beautiful smile every day. On the other hand I’m crying my eyes out.’

‘Is it normal to be so happy and yet so heartbroken?’ asked another. There was a common theme in the messages from the 172,000 followers of the ‘Cumberbitches’ Twitter page and the 117,000 fans of his Facebook page: surprise. ‘She moves fast,’ observed one Cumber-fan.

Benedict and Sophie have known each other for five years, but have been dating for only five months

Benedict and Sophie have known each other for five years, but have been dating for only five months — perhaps even less. ‘It’s wonderful news and we are all thrilled for him,’ said a friend of the actor. ‘I’ve never known him happier, and she is a wonderful woman — very intelligent.

‘They have known each other a long time, but the romance is recent. It really only took off over the summer, maybe even late summer.

‘It has moved fast, but when something works, it works. They are very good for each other and are very much in love. They have mutual friends and mutual interests in the theatre. It just works. They have clicked. It is lovely news.’

When Benedict first met Sophie in 2009, he was dating actress Olivia Poulet, whom he met at university

In recent years, Cumberbatch has been linked to an array of beautiful women. When he first met Sophie in 2009, he was dating actress Olivia Poulet, whom he met at university. They split after 12 years in 2011.

He has also been linked to Russian model Katia Elizarova, Star Trek co-star Alice Eve, daughter of celebrated actor Trevor Eve, and actress Liv Tyler.

Cumberbatch was also rumoured to be in a relationship with socialite Lydia Hearst, 30, daughter of newspaper heiress Patricia Campbell Hearst, who was kidnapped in the 1970s by Left-wing urban guerilla group the Symbionese Liberation Army. She is the granddaughter of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.

Cumberbatch’s last serious girlfriend before Sophie was the fashion designer Anna Jones, from whom he separated in 2012, after a romance lasting not quite a year.

Though he has been linked to a number of women over the years, people who know Benedict insist he has not dated even half of them. One said: ‘He’s not a “player”, although he does go to lots of parties and talks to lots of girls.’

So how did Sophie manage to bag this most eligible — yet elusive — bachelor? In fact, the pair met while working together on set in 2009. They remained friends, but their romantic relationship only took off this summer.

The pair were first spotted watching the French Open tennis together in Paris in June. Since then, they have been seen having dinner together in London — entering and leaving the restaurant separately. They also attended the wedding of one of Cumberbatch’s schoolfriends in September.

And last month the actor was seen in Edinburgh, where Miss Hunter’s mother lives. The young couple were seen strolling in the unseasonal sunshine around the city’s Botanic Garden. Some speculated he had gone to the city to ask Mrs Hunter for permission to make Sophie his wife.

However, a close friend of the star told me last night this was not the case: ‘They just got engaged this week. He didn’t go up to Edinburgh to ask her mum first. He asked her, I think, on Monday, then they rang to put the advert in on Tuesday.’

Friends say Cumberbatch, 38, is now trying to work out when he will be able to tie the knot — between filming Sherlock in January, attending the Oscars in March (he’s a hot tip for Best Actor this year for his role as gay computer genius Alan Turing in The Imitation Game) and a three-month spell as Hamlet at The Barbican next autumn.

Apparently his every moment is accounted for until well into 2016, so perhaps there will be a long engagement — although pals are saying they think he will manage to find a slot over the next 12 months.

So, who is the woman who has won Sherlock’s heart? Like Cumberbatch — who went to Harrow on an art scholarship — she is both artistic and well-connected. Indeed, in this she is a perfect partner for Benedict, the son of two actors, who was raised in Kensington, West London.

Although he can get cross if anyone says he is posh, his grandfather was a Naval submarine commander and had his wedding covered at length in The Times. (Meaning, rather sweetly, that this engagement announcement was part of family tradition.)

Cumberbatch was also rumoured to be in a relationship with socialite Lydia Hearst, 30, daughter of newspaper heiress Patricia Campbell Hearst

His great-grandfather, Henry Cumberbatch, was the British Consul General in Smyrna, Turkey, and received a CMG — an honour sometimes known as ‘Call Me God’ — or Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael & St George.

Sophie, meanwhile, has royal and military ties. Her uncle is Sir Malcolm Ross, an Eton and Sandhurst-educated member of the Royal Household. Sir Malcolm, married to Sophie’s aunt, Susan, was knighted in 1999. He was in the household of the Prince of Wales between 2006 and 2008, and has served as an equerry to the Queen.

He was responsible for organising the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the Queen Mother, and was put in charge of preparations for Baroness Thatcher’s funeral.

Meanwhile, Sophie’s grandfather was General Sir Michael Gow, a high-ranking figure known for his witty portraits of Army life. Sir Michael, who died last year, was General Officer Commanding Scotland from 1979, and one of the first British officers to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.

Sophie was raised by her mother, her parents having separated when she was young. Her father, Charles, is a professional cards player, but started out in insurance. She has two brothers, Patrick and Timothy.

While studying modern languages at Oxford, she began dating artist Conrad Shawcross — once named by Tatler as one of the ‘100 Most Invited’ — the son of William Shawcross, the Queen Mother’s biographer, and art critic Marina Warner.

Sophie moves, then, in very similar circles to Cumberbatch, whose friends include actress Rebecca Hall and Downton’s Laura Carmichael, who plays Lady Edith, and Dan Stevens, who famously left the show.

Benedict and Sophie even have matching porcelain complexions, prominent cheekbones and Bunsen burner blue eyes.

While he launched his acting career straight out of Manchester University, his fiancee reached academic heights. After Oxford, she went to theatre school L’École Internationale de Theatre Jacques Lecoq in Paris — meaning she is fluent in French.

In 2005, she worked with songwriter Guy Chambers on album The Isis Project, in which she sings in French. She is a talented pianist, too.

Cumberbatch’s last serious girlfriend before Sophie was the fashion designer Anna Jones, from whom he separated in 2012

But it is in acting and the theatre that she has made her way. She was awarded the prestigious Samuel Beckett Award in 2007 for writing and directing a play called The Terrific Electric at The Barbican.

She co-founded the Lacuna Theatre Company, and has directed plays and operas, including the 2010 revival of Henrik Ibsen’s Ghosts on Broadway. Her highest-profile acting work was a minor role in 2004 film Vanity Fair. And she and Benedict met while acting in the obscure movie Burlesque Fairytales in 2009.

Now, it seems, he is ready for marriage. Last night, his PR, Karon Maskill, told me: ‘Ben and Sophie are old friends — they have worked together in the past and they just share many of the same friends.’

In a magazine interview last year, Cumberbatch said: ‘Without using words like marriage, children and family . . . put it this way, I hope I’ve got other people to look back with me [when I’m older]. I hope I’m surrounded by family.’

It was his broadest hint yet that he was finally ready to settle down and take on the role of his life: as a bridegroom.
