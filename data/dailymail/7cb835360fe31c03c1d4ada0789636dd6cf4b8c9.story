A 15-year-old accused of stabbing her 12-year-old brother and attempting to stab her younger sister as part of a plot to kill her family and run away with her 23-year-old boyfriend appeared in court in Detroit on Thursday.

Roksana Sikorski has had her bail set at $1 million and has been charged as an adult with four counts of conspiracy to commit murder and one count of assault after putting in action her plot, encouraged by boyfriend, Michael Rivera.

The 'truly haunting' attack began at 2am last Friday at the family's Detroit home when Sikorski attacked her younger sibling's first and then allegedly planned to kill her parents while Rivera sat outside in his car giving instructions via text.

Charged: Roksana Sikorski and Michael Rivera both face charges of conspiracy to murder after Sikorski attacked her family at their Detroit home early on Friday morning 

Rivera, who wore a red jumpsuit in court, faces the same charges as well as a felonious assault charge. He was ordered held on $1 million bond Sunday.

The girl's parents said she and Rivera were in a sexual relationship. 

The Detroit prosecutor's office said that after Sikorski stabbed her brother in the throat his screams alerted her parents, who rushed to his aid.

He was taken to the Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor and is expected to recover after surgery.

Sikorski and Rivera fled the scene and police found them at a home in Detroit's southwest side and took them into custody at 8am on Friday morning.

Concerned: Sikorski's parents Laurene and Jeff believe their daughter was heavily influence by Rivera and told the court in Detroit as much 

'He was using her to do his dirty work. She was under this man's spell,' the girl's mother told reporters after the hearing.

The parents said the girl met Rivera earlier this year through social media. They said they first learned about the relationship after their daughter ran away from home this summer.

'I think it was a big secret. I didn't know about him,' her mother said. 

According to ClickDetroit, Sikorski's parents, Laurene and Jeff, told the court they have a 'strong bond' with their daughter and want to be there for her through these 'difficult times.

'I think she just thought this guy loved her and she wanted to do whatever he told her, and she was very vulnerable and she has a mental disorder and she needs help,' said Laurene Sikorski. 'I want to make sure she gets help.' 

Shocked: Sikorski appeared dazed and confused in the courtroom and is being held on $1 million bail

The couple said they adopted the girl and her two younger siblings from Poland when she was 4½ years old. They said she had been receiving treatment for depression and ADHD.

'She's never been violent in the past. We had no clue this was going to happen,' her mother said. 'She's getting psychiatric counseling. She's on medications. We've done everything in our power to help her.'

Defense attorney Leslie Posner told reporters that the girl and her siblings were physically abused in Poland, eventually removed from their home in that country and later adopted by the Michigan family.

'They came from a very, very, very bad background,' the lawyer said, referring to the abuse that allegedly came from the children's biological parents. 'They were locked in closets. They were beaten.'

The parents in Michigan said they are supporting their daughter despite the charges. If released on bond, the judge said the girl can't have any contact with her siblings and must wear a GPS monitor.

She made eye contact with her parents several times during the hearing.

'Your honor, we have a very strong bond with our daughter,' her mother said.

Court records did not list a lawyer for Rivera on Thursday.

Preliminary hearings for both him and the girl are scheduled for Oct. 31.
