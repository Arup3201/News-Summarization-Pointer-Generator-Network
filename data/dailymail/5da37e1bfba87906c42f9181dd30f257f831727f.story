It was a real family affair last night as Boris Johnson was joined by his brother, sister and parents for the launch of his latest book.

The Mayor of London has written a biography about Sir Winston Churchill - called The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History - and launched it at Dartmouth House in Mayfair.

The 50-year-old was accompanied by his brother Jo, MP for Orpington; sister Rachel, a columnist for the Mail on Sunday; mother Charlotte, a painter; and father Stanley, a former MEP, for the event.

Members of the Churchill family were also at the event, including his great-grandsons Randolph Churchill and Jack Spencer-Churchill, and great-granddaughter Jennie Churchill Repard.

Also in attendance were Chancellor George Osborne, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, radio host Nick Ferrari, magazine editor Emma Soames and designer Thomas Heatherwick.

Mr Johnson wrote the book to mark the 50th anniversary of the wartime prime minister’s death next January. He said: ‘The point of the Churchill Factor is that one man can make all the difference.’

The book - which took the author more than a year to research - claims Churchill's bravery in leading Britain during the Second World War may have been down to him suffering 'short man syndrome'.

Mr Johnson says that with Churchill standing at just 5ft 6in tall, there is evidence to suggest he was driven to succeed to prove a point to bigger bullies at school, who teased him for his height.

So-called 'short man syndrome' has been described by scientists where short men overcompensate for their lack of height through acts of aggression.

In the book he also explains how Churchill's early life as a pupil at the prestigious Harrow School may have led him to show he was made of stern stuff after being bullied for being a 'runt'.

Last week Mr Johnson claimed he suffers from extremely poor eyesight and can barely see anything around the house without his glasses on.

Oxford University graduate Mr Johnson is now the prospective MP for Uxbridge in west London.
