The 13-year-old sole survivor of a Colorado rock slide that crushed her entire family to death Monday said her father shielded her with his body from falling car-sized boulders.

Following the tragedy that left five people dead, Gracie Johnson was airlifted to Children's Hospital of Denver with a broken leg. As of Tuesday morning, her condition was unknown.  

The names of the victims have not been confirmed, but her parents - Dwayne and Dawna Johnson - are believed to have been among the people killed in the rock slide. Both are popular coaches at nearby Buena Vista High School, the Denver Post reports.

Trapped: Five hikers are buried beneath untold tons of rock and rubble Monday night and rescuers are afraid even more could come down on them if they stay at the site

The hikers were buried Monday morning on a
short mile-and-a-half trail at Agnes Vaille Falls near Mount Princeton -
130 miles southwest of Denver.

Gracie's sister Kiowa, who was a senior at Buena Vista, also perished in the rock slide. The family has a son, Dakota, who recently graduated from there.

Chaffee County Sheriff's Deputy Nick Tolsma was among the first officials to respond to the scene of the collapse, where he discovered Gracie alive under a rock.  

'I heard a scream next to me. I saw a hand sticking out underneath the boulder,' Tolsma told ABC News. 'The true hero is her dad. She said her dad jumped on her to protect her at the last moment when the rocks were coming down. I think he saved her life.'

Sheriff Pete Palmer called off the recovery operation Monday night because the area is too unstable and experts fear another rock slide.

'They are in bad shape. They were rolled over by boulders as big as these cars,' Palmer told reporters.

'There is no one alive up there.'

Sheriff's department spokeswoman Monica 
Broaddus said rescuers left the mountain before dark Monday. She said 
the recovery effort would wait until likely Tuesday afternoon, after an 
engineer could survey the slide area to make sure it's safe to remove 
the bodies.

The sheriff confirmed that Gracie Johnson was hiking with her family.

The disaster happened about 11am. Rescuers were forced to retreat shortly after the rock slide, over fears that even more boulders could come crashing down the mountainside.

By the afternoon, the county's resident geologist was inspecting the scene to advise rescuers over how to proceed at the site.

Loose rocks: The area around the popular hiking trail had received heavy rains recently, which could have caused the devastating rock slide

Backed up: Police closed the road around the hiking trail, causing traffic to pile up in the rural part of Colorado

Large amounts of rain had previously fallen on Mount Princeton, which could have contributed to the boulders coming loose and sliding down the mountain. 

The trail is popular with day hikers because it offers just a short, rocky scramble to the spectacular Agnes Vaille Falls.

The trail is below Mount Princeton, a 14,197-foot peak. The National Forest Service describes the trail as short and relatively easy.

The trail is one of the first hikes recommended to people new to the area and is also popular with tourists, said Margaret Dean, a regular hiker who has hiked the trail with her 7-year-old grandson.
