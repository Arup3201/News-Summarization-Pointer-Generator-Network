A 75-year-old referee speared through the throat with a javelin at an athletics meeting in Germany has died from his injuries.

Dieter Schmidt had gone to measure the throw of a previous athlete when the javelin from the next contestant hit him in the throat and exited out of his neck.

Paramedics revived the victim at the scene and an emergency doctor escorted him as he was taken to the Dusseldorf's University Hospital, where he was operated on after losing a lot of blood from his main artery.

Tragic: Dieter Schmidt has died from his injuries after being hit by a javelin

Emergency services reported the referee had severed his carotid artery.

Seven spectators in the 800-strong crowd who witnessed the accident yesterday and a 17-year-old javelin thrower were given counselling at the scene as police evacuated the stadium.

The annual Wilhelm Unger Games event for young athletes was cancelled after the tragedy.

Dusseldorf fire department spokesman, Michael Sandforth, told German website, The Local: 'He was bleeding very badly and lost a lot of blood.

'Our emergency doctor administered first aid and then he was taken to hospital.

'There was a helicopter at the scene but the doctor made the decision that there was an urgent need to bring him back round so he was taken nearby to the university clinic in the emergency doctor's vehicle.'

Schmidt has been described as a 'highly experienced international javelin judge'. His 18-year-old granddaughter Fiona was due to compete at the championships.
