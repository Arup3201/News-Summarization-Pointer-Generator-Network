They are more commonly found atop a rolling hillside, perhaps looking out on to a beautiful countryside vista.

But it seems whoever decided to place this bench in front an unsightly graffiti-clad concrete wall in Scarborough, did not get the memo.

Positioned as a place for passers-by to take a well-earned rest, the wrought-iron based bench lies under the St Nicolas Cliff lift in 
Scarborough, North Yorkshire.

The bench at St Nicolas Cliff lift in Scarborough, which has been dubbed the worst view in Britain

Nick Thornton, 36, who has lived in Scarborough all of his life, said: 'I have often wondered why it's there, what a horrible place to put a bench.

'It must be the worst view in Britain. 

'I would never sit on the bench, all you can see is graffiti and a dark hollow, it's the stuff of nightmares. 

'There are benches round the corner you can sit on with a much nicer view, and you're not in a dingy, dark environment. 

'Whoever decided to plonk it there needs a serious talking to.'

Just metres from the bench, which lies under the St Nicolas Cliff lift in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, is an unsightly graffiti-clad concrete wall, which falls foul of any sort of charm

Bizarrely, just metres away, lies an open leafy clearing with plenty of light, and a much more attractive view

Bizarrely, just metres away, lies an open leafy clearing with plenty of light, and a much more attractive view.

Indeed, just round the corner, lies a parade of other benches, with a pleasant view overlooking South Bay.

While it likely to have been there for some years, it is thought that the bench was placed there after the wall was built.

Scarborough Borough Council was unable to comment on why the bench was initially erected in this particular spot.
