Raheem Sterling was involved in full Liverpool training on Wednesday but still faces a late battle to be fit to face Turkish outfit Besiktas at Anfield Stadium.

Sterling has missed Liverpool’s previous two matches and will undergo a late fitness test ahead of Thursday’s Europa League clash.

The England ace was all smiles as he joined in with Daniel Sturridge and co but midfield duo Steven Gerrard and Lucas are definitely ruled out of the clash due to injury.

Brendan Rodgers will also have to do without Serbian midfielder Lazar Markovic who is suspended for the match following his red card in Liverpool’s final Champions League match.

Markovic will miss four games through suspension after he was sent off for putting his hand in the face of Behrang Safari during the game against Basle.

Rodgers said: 'We are obviously disappointed with the length of the ban. We felt it was very harsh but we accept it and unfortunately he won’t be able to contribute. Hopefully he will play many more European games for the club.'

Striker Mario Balotelli was also in fine spirits during training but the former AC Milan striker again showed distaste for bibs.

Balotelli refused to wear his with memories of that Manchester City episode clearly fresh in the memory of the Italian.

Instead he decided to hold on to it before throwing it in the air to practice header with.
