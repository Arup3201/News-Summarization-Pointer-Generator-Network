Peter Briggs, 35, admitted assault after grabbing a 14-year-old boy who laughed when he told him off for burping

A surveyor was hauled before the courts after grabbing a teenager who laughed when he told him off for burping.

Peter Briggs, 35, seized the 14-year-old by the head outside a railway station cafe after the schoolboy started giggling at his ticking off.

The terrified teenager's head banged on a metal post during the 'unprovoked' attack causing a cut which later required gluing.

Yesterday magistrates ordered Briggs to do 100 hours of community service.

He was also told to pay £200 in compensation to the boy and £145 in costs after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm.

His lawyer told the court that he had not been thinking clearly and was shocked and remorseful.

The boy and a friend had been sitting outside a cafe at Llandudno Junction Railway Station in Conwy, Wales, when they came to the attention of Briggs, who was sitting at a neighbouring table. 

James Neary, prosecuting, told Llandudno Magistrates Court that the teenager was burping and prompted Briggs to comment 'that's disgusting.'

The commercial surveyor lost his temper when the pair started laughing at his rebuke.

The teenager was upset after the attack and raced inside a cafe and Briggs was only stopped from following when a female commuter intervened and blocked his path.

Briggs left the scene and police and an ambulance were called to take the boy to a nearby hospital.

The teenager, who had been waiting to catch a train to a skate park, sustained a one centimetre cut within his hair in the assault, which was captured on the railway station’s CCTV cameras.

Mr Neary told the court that Briggs left because he was ‘embarrassed’.

‘He started to think about what he had done and decided to leave because he was embarrassed,’ the prosecutor said. Briggs was later arrested and he quickly apologised, saying that he was shocked at his own behaviour.

Briggs later told police he had been to visit his ill-father and was not thinking straight when the incident took place in July last year. 

'At the railway station he was deep in thought and heard the child burp. When he told the boy what he did was disgusting, the child just laughed at him and he got angry,' Mr Neary said.

Briggs of Altrincham, Cheshire, was shocked at what he had done and was sorry.

'It's an overreaction by the defendant,' the prosecutor said.

He admitted the charge of assault causing actual bodily harm when he appeared before Llandudno Magistrates Court.

Alex Fitzgerald, defending, said the injury was caused 'recklessly' when Briggs lost his temper and grabbed the boy by the head, intending simply to shake him. 

But in the heat of the moment, he banged the boy’s head against a metal post, causing a cut.

'There's a huge degree of remorse. 

 He insisted that Briggs, who has a degree in real estate from Sheffield Hallam University, meant to shake the boy, rather than injure him. He did not realise he was injured when he initially left the scene, he added.

‘He’s reacted in a way which for him is completely out of character. There’s a huge degree of remorse,’ Mr Fitzgerald said.

Mr Neary said his behaviour was an ‘over-reaction’ and that 14-year-olds were ‘vulnerable’ in public places.

DTZ, where Briggs has worked for more than two years as a graduate surveyor, declined to comment.
