A sea of vibrant colour enveloped the mythical Saraswati river at Allahabad as the crowds descended for the Kumbh Mela festival, among them, thousands of holy men and those young people hoping to be initiated into this ancient section of Indian society.

The Kumbh Mela, the mass Hindu pilgrimage of faith in which Hindus gather to bathe in a sacred river, takes place every three years, switching between four cities, with last year’s event in Allahabad attracting more than 100 million pilgrims, making it the biggest gathering of humans in history.

Now a stunning set of pictures taken by photographer Eric Lafforgue, has opened a rare window into the complex and often hidden world of the religion's holy men or Sadhus who attend the festival.

Sadhus must abandon all their material possessions and familial attachments, living a life of poverty housed in temples or caves, starting each day by bathing in cold water, and supported by donations by the devout

As well as a pilgrimage for the devoted, the Kumbha Mela provides an opportunity for young people to become a holy person and join the Sadhus; devoting their lives to achieving spiritual liberation - the final stage of life according to Hinduism.

Those pictured with skulls are known as the Aghori; an intense type of Sadhu who venture far beyond austerity and make it their life's work to overcome taboos, whether by meditating over corpses or even, occasionally, eating human flesh.

Others show their allegiance to Hinduism by wearing saffron-yellow longhis (tunics) if they happen to be a devotee of Shiva or yellow and white for Vishnu, and paint their faces with sacred scenes and symbols.

Sacred: One of the most important parts of the festival for pilgrims is having the chance to take a dip in the sacred Ganges River

Their quest for spirituality is helped along by smoking cannabis; the scent of which hangs heavy over the Kumbh Mela celebrations as the Sadhus, who are widely respected throughout India, gear up for the the rituals which include bathing in the river.

But not every Sadhu completes the same ritual: Hindu worship includes a wide variety of different devotions, depending on the origin of the Sadhu and the guru with whom they trained.

While some adopt a life of solitary wandering, others live in communities. Others are known for particular practices, such as the Black Sadhu who, due to their association with the rituals of death are often feared and rumoured to eat human flesh.

The fakir, meanwhile, engage in dramatic displays of devotion to their faith, performing feats of endurance such as holding their hand above their head, or standing on one foot for years at a time

At the Kumbh Mela, thousands of recruits undergo initiation to become Sadhus, staying up all night in prayer and group meditation by the banks of the sacred river.

Chilly: Pilgrims continue to wander down to bathe in the river late into the night, although many choose to do so fully clothed

Washing: Although sacred, the Ganges is also used for everything from sourcing cooking water to washing saris such as these

Handy: Saris washed in the holy waters of the Ganges are then transferred to the roofs of considerably less sacred cars to dry

Ahead of the celebrations, young Sadhu recruits are shaven and their hair rolled into a ball and buried on the banks of the Ganges to symbolise renouncing of their past life.

Those who are already initiated spend the 55 days of the Kumbha Mela blessing believers who come to pray for money, health or for their sins to be cleansed.

Visitors touch the Sadhu’s feet as a mark of resect and he blesses them, rubbing their foreheads with ceremonial ash, and recieving a donation from the pilgrims in return.

To house the millions of visitors, vast temporary camps are erected and as a result, as photographer Eric Lafforgue reveals, in lots of people getting lost in the crowds. ‘All day, loudspeakers blare out names and descriptions of people separated from their friends and family,' he reveals.
