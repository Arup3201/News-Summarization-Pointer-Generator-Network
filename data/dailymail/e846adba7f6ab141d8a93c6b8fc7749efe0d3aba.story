A gang created an elaborate underground cannabis factory in a series of buried shipping containers that were accessed through a trapdoor cut into a caravan, a court heard.

The subterranean enterprise, cultivating plants with a street value of £150,000, had running water, electricity, and its own sophisticated air supply system. 

Cunning Adam Williams, 42, and David Bradbury, 51, had buried the four capsules in a remote field in the West Country and covered them with two caravans.

The duo had then cut trapdoors into the floor of one of the caravans and used a series of ladders to climb down into the submerged containers.

Each container was its own mini cannabis production unit and was equipped with powerful lights to help the cannabis plants grow.

A police video showed the interior of the factory with ventilation pipes and fans powered by a complex electrical set-up. A deck chair can also be seen nestled among the growing plants.

When police raided the cave-style operation  they discovered a crop of more than 150 plants, worth an estimated £150,000.

Bradbury was jailed for three-and-a-half years, and Williams was sent to prison for four-and-a-half years for production of cannabis at Taunton Crown Court in May last year.

Today the pair were brought back to court and ordered to pay back a total of £35,000 of their ill-gotten-gains or face a further year and six weeks in prison.

The proceeds of crime hearing was told heard Williams, from Spaxton, Somerset, benefited to the amount of £39,099 from the drugs ring and was ordered to pay back £31,370.

Sidekick Bradbury from West Bagborough earned £35,720 from the factory, and was ordered to pay back £2,905. 

Dr Kirstie Cogram, Manager of Avon and Somerset Police's Financial Investigation Unit, said: 'The public can be assured that we will deprive criminals both of their liberty and assets if they have been making money through illegal activity like this.'
