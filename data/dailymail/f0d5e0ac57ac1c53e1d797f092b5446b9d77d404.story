Lleyton Hewitt is still targeting sole ownership of the record title haul at the Queen's Club Aegon Championships after easing into the second round.

The 33-year-old Australian last won in Kensington in 2006 and shares the all-time record of four tournament victories with American Andy Roddick.

Hewitt reached the semi-finals last year, before being dislodged by Marian Cilic - and believes that run sparked a resurgence in form leading to him claiming the Brisbane International title.

High five? Australian 33-year-old beat Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-3 6-3 as he searches for a record fifth title

Hewitt saw off Roger Federer in January to land his first title in four years, and is aiming to sustain his hot streak after overcoming Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-3, 6-3.

"I'd love to win a fifth title here," said Hewitt.

"That run I had last year was great. I felt like I got a lot of confidence out of that.

"That set me up for a good US summer and a good US Open, beating Del Potro there as well.

"I really love coming back to this tournament and playing well.

"I love coming here, I just love the surroundings.

"The setting was a fantastic crowd for a first day at Queen's where a lot of the top seeds have byes as well.

"I felt pretty sharp out there, I've been hitting the ball well in practice, I felt good on the grass straight away.

"The last few years it hasn't taken me long to adapt after clay, I'm fortunate in that way, but I come in with a positive mindset as well."

Hewitt is still ranked 43 in the world, but said he has no interest in the statistics - instead he will chase that elusive fifth Queen's title and a positive run at Wimbledon.

"I don't set any targets over that, I couldn't care less about my ranking," he said.

"Obviously I want to win every tournament I enter, and every match I play.

"The majors are still the top motivation, and in a couple of weeks' time it's one of the big ones for me."
