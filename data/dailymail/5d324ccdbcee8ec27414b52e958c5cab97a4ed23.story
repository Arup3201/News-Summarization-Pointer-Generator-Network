A prestigious girls' school, attended by some of Los Angeles' most affluent families, has been threatened by legal action from a former student who claims she fell pregnant by a teacher.

The alleged victim, who has not been identified, is planning to sue Marlborough School more than a decade after she claimed she was coerced and manipulated into sex at the age of 16 with former teacher Joseph Koetters.

The woman, who spoke to Vanity Fair, alleged that in the early 2000s, she was targeted by the English teacher and began having sex with him.

She told the magazine: 'He made me feel like the smartest, funniest, most beautiful person walking the planet.'

She was soon meeting up with the teacher at his home when his gynecologist wife was not there.

She said that he normalized the inappropriateness of his actions, saying 'this is something special, and we’re entitled to pursue it as human beings'.

The girl ended up pregnant but Koetter organized for her to have an abortion, she claimed. He went into 'clinical' mode and talked about 'handling it', she told Vanity Fair.

She miscarried the baby just under three months into the pregnancy. Throughout her ordeal, the teenager told no one.

The woman has claimed that she contacted Koetters in 2009 after hearing a rumor that he had turned his attentions to another student - which he denied.

Daily Mail Online had reached out to her lawyer, David M. Ring, for comment on Monday. 

It is unclear when the suit will be filed. Also unclear is if the woman has filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department.  

The alleged victim decided to reveal her story after several former students said last year that Koetters had been inappropriate with them at the school - which counts heiress Betsy Bloomingdale, actress Camilla Belle and philanthropist Nancy Barry Munger among its alumni.

These women had come forward to give their accounts of Koetters, now 47, following an essay in June 2014 by Marlborough alumna Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie (now a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania).

Her essay, published on xoJane, revealed an inappropriate relationship that Koetters instigated with her in 2011 while she was a 16-year-old junior.  

In her essay, Miss Gilbert-Lurie said that Koetters crossed the student-teacher boundary when she asked to interview him for the school newspaper.

He agreed, replying 'It's a date' to her email.

Later when they met up  outside the school, she wrote that he dodged her questions and turned the conversation towards romantic poetry, saying he could lend her one of his favorite books. 

At the end of the conversation, his hands brushed against her knee.

While Miss Gilbert-Lurie admitted in her essay that the flirting made her feel good at first, she became less comfortable with their relationship when he started getting more explicit in their email conversations.

He said he knew how to draw boundaries with other students but not with her and talked about how her short school skirt made her 'so alluring'.

A slew of allegations about Koetters' inappropriate behavior emerged following an essay published last summer by Marlborough alumna Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie (pictured)

A few day later, the teen wrote him saying they needed to stop so she could focus on finals and 'just being 16'.

Koetters responded 'Ugh, Ok,' but continued to harass her in class and through email, the teen claimed. 

With the support of her brother, she decided to tell her parents. 

In 2011, Miss Gilbert-Lurie and her parents informed the school about Koetters' inappropriate behavior, prompting  an investigation.

Head teacher, Barbara Wagner, told the family that the complaint would be taken seriously - and was allegedly advised by the president of the board of trustees to handle the matter internally.

When asked if there had been previous complaints against Koetters, it appeared that the head teacher failed to mention a similar complaint in 2005. 

It does not appear that complaint by a female student was credited at the time, according to the magazine. 

Koetters, who had taught at Marlborough for 14 years, was sent to sexual harassment training following Miss Gilbert-Lurie's complaints and stripped of his position as chair of the English department - but was not fired because it was a 'first-time offense'. 

Miss Gilbert-Lurie was moved to another English class.  

Marlborough claimed last year that they were unaware of Miss Gilbert-Lurie's allegation from her xojane essay that Koetters had touched her knee.

The UPenn student said that the school had been informed.

Koetters remained at the school alongside Miss Gilbert-Lurie for another year before starting a new job at  the elite Polytechnic School in Pasadena.

Vanity Fair reported that Polytechnic was aware of Koetters' discipline at Marlborough.

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Polytechnic on Monday. 

However following Miss Gilbert-Lurie's explosive essay last summer, Buzzfeed found that she was not the only young women to have been the focus of Koetter's alleged unwanted advances.   

At least eight ex-students claimed a similar pattern of behavior from 47-year-old Koetters, which ranged from sexual comments to sexually-charged emails and touches on the knee.

It appeared that Koetters complained about his wife, a gynecologist, and his children to the girls, before complimenting them on being gifted students.  

One former student, identified as Mariah, says Koetters once told her: 'I love you in ways that are totally inappropriate for a teacher to love a student.'

She also recalled the time they were discussing the book Disgrace by JM Coetzee, which is about an inappropriate relationship between an English professor and a student.

Mariah talked about how she wanted to write an essay on the book, focusing on predators and prey.

That's when Koetters told her: 'Just because someone is in a position of power over someone else doesn't mean the relationship can't be mutual.'

'He told me that if we had sex, it could be mutual, it could me love,' Mariah recalled. She said he then put his hand on her knee.

Another 2012 graduate recalled how Koetters would use his power over female students to turn friends against each other. 

A former student identified as Stephanie says he turned their innocent conversations about help with class into a venting session where he would complain about his family.

Stephanie said she felt like an adult when he talked to her about his problems, but knows how wrong it was in retrospect.

'Now that I'm close to my thirties, I realize how wrong the situation was and regret not speaking out,' she said.

The woman who spoke to Vanity Fair this month revealed that she had reached out to Koetters following Miss Gilbert-Lurie's xojane essay last year. 

He told her that Gilbert-Lurie was lying. It was then that the woman decided to contact Miss Gilbert-Lurie. 

Last summer, the two former Marlborough students went to the head of Polytechnic together where the head teacher claimed that he would file a police report. 

Koetters resigned that day.

It was a shocking scandal for the $35,000-a-year institution, the oldest day school in California, which teaches girls from grades 7 - 12. Marlborough ranks in the top schools in the U.S. when it comes to SAT scores and students commonly go on to Ivy League colleges. 

The private school was forced to launch an investigation in the summer of 2014 following the revelations. 

The school's board of trustees put together a 'special investigative committee', made up of five of its own members, including a judge and high-powered attorney. 

Following the investigation, Marlborough reportedly sent an eight-page letter to parents where there was a buried a reference to Koetters 'inappropriate physical conduct' with a student. 

The committee placed full responsibility at the feet of beloved head teacher of 26 years, Barbara Wagner. 

She tendered her resignation and is due to leave at the end of the school year in June. 

Many feel that the head teacher has been hung out to dry by the school board, according to Vanity Fair, and there are rumbles of unease among the school's high-flying and generous donors.

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a response from Marlborough on Monday.
