The average American has a one in nine chance of joining the wealthiest one per cent of the nation, study shows.

About 11 per cent of workers in the United States will move into the top one per cent of income earners for at least a year sometime between the ages of 25 and 60.

This could mean that there's more income mobility in America than one might think - at least in the top tiers if income earners.

For those in the top five and ten per cent of the wealthiest in the nation, there's more fluidity between the 99 and one per cent, according to a study done by professors Tom Hirschl of Cornell University and Mark Rank of Washington University.

The researchers found that by the age of 60, 70 percent will spend at least a year in the top 20 percent of earners and 53 percent will spend at least a year in the top 10 percent. 

Additionally, 36 percent will spend at least a year in the top five percent and 11 percent will spend at least a year in the top one percent. 

Indicators for top-level wealth included, education, marriage, race, age and disability status. Race appears to be a dominant factor (file photo)

As of 2012, those who had an adjusted gross income of $434,682 were in the top one per cent of income earners, according to CBS.  

But when they looked at the demographic of Americans who are more likely to float around in the upper levels of income, findings are less surprising. 

They found they are mostly older, white, married, educated for more than 12 years and lacking any work disability.

Of those who made it to the top one per cent, however, only 1.6 per cent stayed for five consecutive years and only .06 per cent stayed for more than ten years. 

And as the level of income gets lower down the ladder, fluidity seems to remain - of those in the top 20 per cent of earners, the odds of staying at that level for more than a decade is just one in five, research showed.

'Income fluidity is a double-edged sword,' the authors wrote, 'creating opportunity for many, along with insecurity that this opportunity may end sooner than hoped for.' 

The strongest indicators of top-level wealth are education, marriage and race. 

The researchers found race such a dominant factor that it 'suggests persisting patterns of social inequality related to past and present discrimination and exclusion'.

'Thus it would be misguided to presume that top-level income attainment is solely a function of hard work, diligence, and equality of opportunity,' they wrote. 

Other studies have shown that there is less income mobility at lower wealth levels. Once study found that for fathers in the bottom 20 per cent of earners, 42 per cent of their sons remain at the low levels.
