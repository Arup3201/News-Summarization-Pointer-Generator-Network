Bold move: SSE is to freeze household energy prices until January 2016, leading to calls for its rivals to do the same

Britain's second-biggest energy firm 
has announced it will axe hundreds of jobs and slash spending on wind 
farms to fund a freeze on gas and electricity bills.

However, there are already many cheaper deals available which last for even longer – including one from SSE itself.

The
 decision by SSE means the average standard tariff dual-fuel bill for 
those paying by cheque or cash will be held at £1,266 until January 
2016.

It represents a remarkable U-turn for 
the company, which had argued that a price freeze would be dangerous 
when the idea was put forward by Labour leader Ed Miliband last autumn.

The
 move also heaps pressure on the other major players to follow suit. 
British Gas, EDF, Eon, Npower and Scottish Power have also argued 
against price freezes.

The
 news triggered a heated row at Prime Minister’s Questions as David 
Cameron and the Labour leader squabbled over who should take credit.

For
 months, the Prime Minister ridiculed Labour’s pledge to freeze energy 
prices if it wins the next election as a ‘price con’ that was impossible
 to deliver because of fluctuating global prices.

But Mr Miliband 
insisted the decision by SSE meant Mr Cameron’s argument had been 
‘totally demolished’.

SSE’S move to scale back on new wind farms is a crushing blow to the green energy revolution.

The decision puts at risk billions of pounds of investment in plans to build and operate wind turbines over the next 20 years.

One
 of a number of schemes being shelved by SSE is its involvement in the 
Forewind scheme off the coast of East Yorkshire, which has the potential
 to be the largest in the world and produce almost 10 per cent of the 
UK’s electricity needs.

Dale
 Vince, founder of green energy firm Ecotricity, said: ‘There is so much
 political pressure on the industry we are seeing companies make wrong, 
short-term decisions and fail to invest in renewable energy.

‘SSE
 is cutting 500 jobs and dumping offshore wind projects. It shows how 
broken the industry is that these sacrifices have to be made for 
short-term price stability.’

SSE said the freeze is possible as it plans to cut costs by £100million, axe 500 jobs and cancel spending on new wind farms.

Six months ago, SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies dismissed Labour’s price freeze plan as ‘unsustainable’.

Yesterday
 he said: ‘We’re responding to questions that have been asked of us with
 a positive agenda for customers, including the longest ever 
unconditional energy price freeze.’

However,
 the firm’s new deal is still more expensive than others available.

And 
even SSE itself has a tariff that holds prices until March 2017 and 
comes in at an annual average of £1,186, a saving of around £80 a year, 
although it has to be paid monthly by direct debit.

Clare
 Francis, of price comparison website MoneySuperMarket, said: ‘Those 
paying the provider’s standard prices could still save money by 
switching to a cheaper tariff.

'There are seven tariffs where the price is fixed until 2016 and five fixed until 2017.’

Adam
 Scorer, of customer watchdog Consumer Futures, said: ‘A freeze at 
current electricity prices will provide security and reassurance for 
millions of consumers, even if it will not reduce the burden on 
households struggling to afford to keep their homes warm.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SSE price freeze was a vindication for his own policy but Prime Minister David Cameron said it was the result of government cuts to green levies

The number of people switching energy supplier is lower now than a decade ago, a study shows.

In 2003 a total of 7.26million switched gas and electricity supplier, compared to only 5.88million in 2013.

The numbers peaked in 2008 at 9.58million and have been falling ever since.

The research was carried out by The Big Deal which is arranging collective switching so a large group of customers can secure a better deal.

It found that despite what Energy UK and the Big Six claim the amount of switching is lower now than it was ten years ago. 

Henry de Zoete, co-founder of The Big Deal, said: 'Energy UK and the Big Six claim that the market is working because more and more people are switching. 

'The truth is the opposite.  There are less switches now than ten years ago.  Investigating the Big Six is long overdue but people need help with their bills now.

' A review will take years to complete and even longer to implement.  People can rightly ask how many more winters will go by before bills come down?  The Big Deal will deliver cheaper energy now by harnessing people power to get a better deal.'
