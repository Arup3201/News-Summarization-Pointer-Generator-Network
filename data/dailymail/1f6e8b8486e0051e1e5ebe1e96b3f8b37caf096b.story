Prolific: Robert Knowles, pictured in May, has chalked up his 334th offence - and has been in court every year since 1959

An unstoppable thief who has been in court an average of three times a year since 1959 has been jailed - for clocking up his 334th crime.

Robert Knowles, 66, has broken the law so many times that prosecutors have lost track of his records.

The alcoholic is 'institutionalised' and steals to be sent back to jail, a court heard.

And this week marked a personal milestone for him - it was his 200th conviction for shoplifting.

Knowles, who started his spree aged 13, was caught on Wednesday stealing two boxes of chocolate from Thorntons in Plymouth city centre.

Despite him eating the £13 chocolates in the street, a security guard let him off with a warning.

So he strolled to a nearby Tesco Metro and walked out with £26 of food - prompting staff to call police.

Alan Harris, defending, said: 'He has spent much of the last decade, if not more, in prison.

'I have addressed dozens of benches over the years with a maudlin debate about whether he wants to die in prison.'

And in 2011, when Knowles admitted stealing two bottles of whiskey, watches and socks worth £279 from Marks and Spencer, Mr Harris said: 'He recognises himself as institutionalised.

'He can cope very easily with prison but cannot cope very well with the world outside.

'He
would rather be in custody and is resigned to spending the bulk of the 
rest of his life there. This is as bleak a plea and mitigation as this 
court can ever wish to hear.'

The Crown Prosecution Service cannot give a full breakdown of his offences because so many of
them they pre-date its creation in 1986.

Homeless Knowles was sent to a correctional school at the age of 13 and has been stealing ever since - appearing in court 186 times, including in every single year since 1959.

Knowles was last jailed in July for stealing wine, chicken and boxer shorts from Marks and Spencer - but was released four months later.

Presiding magistrate Nadine Fletcher jailed Knowles for two months after he admitted both thefts.

Knowles has been one of several criminals to win the dubious honour of being named 'Britain's most prolific thief'.

Those with an even worse record include Bolton kleptomaniac Harry Hankinson, 64 - who in June blamed his 501 crimes on a blow to the head in 1970 which changed his personality.

And in March David Archer, from Prestatyn, North Wales, clocked up his 343rd offence - just edging out competition from Knowles.
