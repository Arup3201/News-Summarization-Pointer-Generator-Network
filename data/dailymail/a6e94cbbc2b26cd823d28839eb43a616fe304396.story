The multi-millionaire founder of Twitter is selling his San Francisco townhouse for $3million.

Evan Williams, co-founder of the microblog site, has put his home on the market after four years and is set to make a $600,000 profit on the modest-looking property.

Last year Mr Williams enraged neighbours in another San Francisco neighbourhood when he announced plans to demolish another $3million house and build an ‘eco-home’.

Bird's nest: Twitter co-foudner Evan Williams is selling this San Francisco property for just under $3million - a sale which is set to put him $600,000 in the green

In 2012, the social-media multi-millionaire filed a planning application to tear down a historic building worth millions to replace it with a ‘zero-net energy’ house.

More than 240 objections were lodged against the project, with some neighbours calling it ‘criminal’ to demolish the 5,000 square-foot Louis Christian Mullgardt designed house.

The property currently on the market is another pet-project for Mr Williams, who is the man behind several social media companies, including Blogger.

Mr Williams and his wife bought the home in Noe Valley in 2009 for $2.4million, and have since remodelled the house.

Media man: Mr Williams, who was named CEO of Twitter on its launch in 2007, has founded several social media companies, including Blogger and current publishing project Medium

Hashtag home: The Noe Valley property is on the market for $2,995,000 and has three floors, four bedrooms, a roof terrace and a guest house

The three-storey house has four bedrooms, a private garden and a roof terrace.

A separate guest house in the garden includes one bedroom, loft and a skylight.

Mr Williams is currently working on self-publishing platform Medium, set to launch to the wider public this year, after leaving Twitter in 2011.

In comparison to Twitter, Mr Williams’ new project focuses publishing posts and content listed by popularity, not real-time.

‘If you’re a Web publisher, you’re primarily paying attention to page views,’ Mr Williams told All Things Digital last year.

‘But whether people are actually reading your stuff, whether they’re on the page for five seconds or five minutes, is something we’re looking to measure.’
