Former billionaire tycoon Sean Quinn was today told by a judge he has only himself to blame the nine-week jail sentence awarded to him for his role in a multimillion-euro asset-stripping plot.

The bankrupt businessman, once Ireland's most wealthy individual, opted to go straight to prison for his 'outrageous' contempt and for failing to untangle a scheme that put the family's 500million euro international property empire beyond the reach of the former Anglo Irish Bank.

Quinn has already lost control of his 
Irish-based businesses in a titanic legal fight with the former Anglo 
Irish Bank, was ruled in contempt of court for shifting ownership of his
properties throughout Europe to friends and business fronts.

The 66-year-old, who could have remained free until his Supreme Court appeal, was flanked by supporters in the High Court in Dublin, which was packed with barristers, onlookers and media.

Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne told Quinn he had committed a serious contempt of court which had been nothing short of outrageous, he had been evasive and uncooperative during the hearing, and his evidence was not credible.

The judge acknowledged the proceedings had negatively consumed his and his family's life.

'In my view, he has only himself to blame,' she added.

The resigned-looking former cement, insurance and property tycoon cried as he held a crumpled tissue in his hand, looking straight ahead with his bloodshot eyes.

As police were about to lead him off to 
jail, Quinn offered an angry and defiant apology, insisting the billions
he owed was a minor matter compared to his family's loss of wealth, 
status and control of still-viable businesses. 'Did I make mistakes 
in the last two years? ... Yes, I did. Do I apologize here now in public
for that? Yes, I do,' he said. 'Is it small fry compared to the overall
assault that has been launched on us, and taking over our companies and
destroying them? It's an absolute disaster.'

Barristers for Quinn, who will be 
freed on January 4, appealed for compassionate leave to attend a 
granddaughter's christening on December 22 - but the judge said that was
a decision for the Prison Service.

Quinn
Snr owes Anglo 2.8billion euros (£2.24billion) after running up 
unprecedented losses through secret stock investments in the bank as its
share price collapsed.

The
family admit they owe 455million euros (£364billion) but have refused 
the claims on the rest and have taken a counter-case against the bank, 
rebranded the IBRC (Irish Bank Resolution Corporation), over a loans 
deal.

Irish courts in mid-2011 had 
ordered Quinn to stop such asset-stripping immediately because the 
state-owned Anglo bank was entitled to those assets to offset unpaid 
loans totaling 2.8 billion euros (£2.5billion).

But
Anglo investigators demonstrated that Quinn had continued those efforts
and had falsely dated documents to try to conceal the secret sales 
involving properties in Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, India and other 
countries worth an estimated £300 million.

Today
following a lunch break spent in discussion with lawyers and his eldest
son, Quinn decided to go to jail immediately at Dublin's overcrowded 
Mountjoy Prison.

His spectacular rise and fall 
provides the defining personal story of Ireland's 1990s rise as a 
property-obsessed Celtic Tiger - and its stunning collapse in 2008 when 
that Anglo-driven construction boom turned to bust.

The son of a Northern Ireland border farmer, Quinn started his first construction-materials business in 1973 with a £100 loan.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s canny acquisitions allowed his empire to grow from cement to hotels, insurance to bottlemaking, his name adorning trucks and office blocks across Ireland.

He built a fiercely loyal following in his native borderland, a traditionally jobs-poor region, where he based most of his enterprises. Forbes in 2008 listed him as the 164th richest man in the world.

But fatefully and inexplicably, he bet his family's riches on the continued runaway success of Anglo, the most daring of Ireland's property financiers, whose shares rose tenfold during the boom years.

Worse, as Anglo's share price reversed course in the run-up to the global credit crisis in 2008, he kept doubling down, borrowing billions from Anglo itself to become the bank's top owner with up to 28 per cent of its shares. 

Ireland nationalised Anglo in early 
2010, rendering Quinn's stock worthless and leaving taxpayers with a 
bill expected to exceed £20 billion, including Quinn's loan defaults.

Quinn
and his family contend in a separate, continuing lawsuit that Anglo's 
loans to them were largely illegal because the bank didn't disclose the 
true scale of its problems, so they shouldn't have to repay them.

Lawyers for the former Anglo, now reorganised as a toxic debt-management agency called the Irish Bank Resolution Corp., insisted all Quinn's assets, whether at home or abroad, must be seized to repay a bill owed ultimately to Irish taxpayers. Irish courts agreed.

During court proceedings over the past year, Quinn and his children were caught concealing the last-minute shifting of ownership for properties to foreign-based fronts and allies, including by making a secret $500,000 payment to a Ukrainian businesswoman to receive legal control of assets that included a shopping mall. Anglo had been due to take control of those properties the next day.

The judge, Dunne, ruled earlier this year that Quinn's defense was incredible and evasive. She postponed his jailing to Friday in hopes his family would reverse the asset-stripping moves in compliance with more than 30 court orders. She ruled Friday this had failed to happen and Quinn 'has only himself to blame.'

In June she ordered that Quinn's son, Sean Jr., and his nephew Peter be jailed for three months in punishment for their role in asset-stripping.

Sean Jr served his sentence but the Peter fled to neighboring Northern Ireland, where border communities staged several public rallies in support of the Quinns.
