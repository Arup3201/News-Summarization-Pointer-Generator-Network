Carl Jenkinson says he is ready to step up and replace Bacary Sagna in the Arsenal first team.

The 22-year-old told the London Evening Standard that, should his French team-mate make his expected move to Manchester City, he will be ready to take his right-back berth.

Jenkinson has made 57 appearances for the club since his move from Charlton Athletic, and scored his first ever senior goal in their final day win over Norwich City.

'I feel that I am ready for it,' he said. 'It is never going to be easy to nail down that spot but I believe in myself and I believe in my ability.

'I want that position to be mine for years to come. Of course I have got a long way to go, because this is a club who look for the best players in the world. If I am going to hold down the position for as long as I want to, I have got a lot of hard work on my hands. But I believe in myself.

'I am the sort of player who needs to play regularly to get the best out of me.

'My fitness and my athleticism is a big part of my game, getting up and down the pitch. It is difficult to show what I can do when I am not playing regularly because it is hard to get into a rhythm.'
