Post-sandwich guilt may become a thing of the past thanks to a baker who has created the UK's lowest calorie bread.

The London-based City banker-turned-baker has launched Plan Bread - a unique sandwich delivery business that provides a virtually carb-free, low calorie super-bread... made from broccoli.

Paul Shackleton, who was made redundant from his trader job at JP Morgan last year, decided to leave the bright lights of the City behind him once and for all, and turn his hand to baking.

A dieter's dream: Using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient, Paul created the lowest carb bread in the UK

Despite having no experience in oven-based work, the 27-year-old set himself the challenge of creating the world's healthiest bread.

He spent hours poring over books in the British Library, studying the latest medical research on how food is stored as fat, and meticulously devised more than 150 prototypes before arriving at Plan Bread's secret recipe.

Using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient, Paul created the lowest carb bread in the UK - as accredited by UKAS (United Kingdom Accreditation Service).

Plan Bread's special recipe has 50 per cent fewer calories and 94 per cent fewer carbs than other popular breads.

As a comparison, 100g of popular, supermarket-bought seeded loaves have 300 calories and 34g of carbohydrate, while 100g of Paul's bread has only 137 calories and just 2g of carbohydrate.

The bread will appeal to the likes of super health-conscious Gwyneth Paltrow, because it is also gluten-free, soy-free, and almost zero GI.

Paul, who is based in central London, has spent much of the last six months rising at 2am to bake for the day ahead conducting an extensive testing and sampling programme to ensure that his recipe is perfect.

Speaking about his exciting new business venture, Paul said: 'In my old job, I always felt guilty eating unhealthy sandwiches at lunchtime.

'I discovered that my colleagues had cut them out of their diet, with no alternatives available. We all thought, surely there must be a better way.

'That's really how Plan Bread was born - the aim of the venture was always to find a truly healthy alternative to the high street sandwich, where no low carbohydrate option was available.

'It wasn't until I started baking that more and more mates started mentioning that they no longer eat bread.

'Gluten intolerance was also far more prevalent than I had realised. Zero gluten then became a key idea behind the product as well, and I feel really pleased that the sandwiches will be available to as many people as possible, not excluding anyone.'

He continued: 'Some people thought I was mad, and, to be honest, at times I did feel a little like an alchemist. But I was always confident in the science behind the process, and am thrilled to have found a result which people are now enjoying.

'We have been very encouraged by the initial feedback to the business and product and will be looking to expand our menu and delivery area throughout 2013.'

Plan Bread delivers platters and individual sandwiches to addresses across West and Central London as well as catering for larger corporate events and supplying office canteens.

Each sandwich is priced between £3.75 and £4.50 and Paul plans to open a series of sandwich shops around London then look to move to outside London once established.

He added: 'The plan is also to greatly expand the range of products. Firstly we are working on a greater line of breads (red cabbage, courgette and some others are in the test stage at the moment).

'Then want to move on to other bread like products namely pizzas.'

If there was one food I had to eat forever it would be bread.

So when I found out about Plan Bread I was more than excited at the prospect of being able to do 'carbs before marbs'.

But with broccoli as the key ingredient, could this really taste as good as a classic hunk of Hovis?

After getting over the bread's slightly green tinge, I tucked in.

What can only be described as a cross between an omelet and brioche, with more bites, the bread tasted really good.

And the best part? The sandwich was crammed full of fresh poached salmon, watercress and a light mayonnaise sauce all for just 219 calories (a Marks and Spencer's equivalent would see you devour over 800 calories).

It may not taste as good as a crisp petite pan with slatherings of butter, but this is the perfect lunchtime fix for dieters who are partial to committing the occasional carbicide.
