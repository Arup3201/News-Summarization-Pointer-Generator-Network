The medicines watchdog is to review the safety of a clot-busting drug used to treat strokes.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is re-examing evidence on the benefits of alteplase after experts said previous assessments may have been flawed.

Patients are given the drug to disperse clots in a treatment known as thrombolysis. It leads to an increased risk of bleeding in the brain, but evidence suggested the danger was outweighed by the benefits of an improved recovery.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has been asked to have another look at the drug after claims previous assessments on the clot-busting drug may be flawed, picture posed by models 

However, Dr Roger Shinton, a stroke specialist, raised concerns in a letter published in The Lancet. 

He told the BBC: ‘My concerns using alteplase for stroke have always been that the risks of this drug are quite considerable, particularly with bleeding into the brain. The question is, do the benefits justify that risk? And I am not myself convinced that they do.’

The MHRA recently reaffirmed that the benefits outweighed the risk but also said it was setting up an expert working group ‘to ensure all relevant sources of evidence have been taken into consideration’. It is expected to report back next year.

German manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim said it stood by the safety of alteplase.

Dr Roger Shinton asked in The Lancet whether the risks posed by alteplase outweighed any benefits
