Benefits cheat Gwyn Kemp-Philp was jailed after investigators discovered he was a property developer who owned land in the South of France

A benefits cheat was jailed after investigators discovered he was a property developer who owned land in the South of France.

Company director Gwyn Kemp-Philp, 69, falsely claimed more than £41,000 in benefits while buying and selling property.

A court heard Kemp-Philp and his wife Christine, 60, had nine different bank accounts in the UK and one in France.

But the businessman only declared one of the accounts and kept his land in France a secret from the authorities.

Prosecutor Christian Jowell said: 'Kemp-Philp received incapacity benefit and submitted applications for housing, council tax and pension credit benefits.

'However he was not entitled to the benefits because he had owned land in France since the early 2000s which he had not declared.

'When he sold the land he did not declare the income.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard Kemp-Philp also failed to declare taking out a £25,000 loan from Lloyds TSB and gaining £13,000 from the sale of a property.

Kemp-Philp, of Newport, south Wales, initially claimed he used the money from the sale to pay back debts and thought the land in France was 'worthless'.

But he later admitted 10 charges of dishonestly making false representation with a view to obtain benefits over eight years.

A judge at Cardiff Crown Court said Kemp-Philp's fraud was 'repeated' and 'intentional'

The 
charges consisted of four of dishonestly making a false statement or 
representation and six of failing to disclose a change in circumstances 
which would affect benefit entitlement.

Between 2005 and 2013 he falsely claimed £41,162.56.

Jailing
 him for four months, Judge Stephen Hopkins told Kemp-Philp: 'For almost
 eight years you repeatedly committed this fraud of public funds - 
offences in which you intentionally deceived.'

Ex-scaffolder Kemp-Philp and his wife have so far paid back just over £6,000.
