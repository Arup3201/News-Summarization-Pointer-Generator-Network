A Florida ex-convict has been arrested and charged with murder and arson in the death of a retired university professor, who had given the suspect and his wife close to $40,000 in financial aid.

Dr Thomas Oakland, 75, was initially believed to have died in a house fire, but an autopsy on the retired University of Florida professor found that he'd been bludgeoned and was already dead when fire consumed his Gainesville home Wednesday.

Police opened a homicide investigation and began searching for a couple who knew the professor. 

Late Thursday, the US Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force apprehended 37-year-old Stephen Underwood Jr. in Jacksonville. Underwood had been released from prison December 22 after convictions for fraud and trafficking in stolen property, according to state records.

Underwood, a day laborer who is currently unemployed, is now being held on charges of murder, arson, burglary and grand theft. The suspect and his wife of two years, Sherry Sidell Underwood, 48, had a relationship with Oakland that was ‘financial,’ Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said.

Gainesville Fire Rescue got the call at 1.07pm Wednesday about flames coming from Oakland's home at 1921 SW 8th Drive in the Kirkwood subdivision, reported the Gainesville Sun. 

The man's body was discovered in one of the home's three bedrooms.  

For years before his death, Oakland had been a ‘Good Samaritan’ who was trying to help Underwood out, police said. Over the year before Underwood went to prison, investigators believe Oakland gave him more than $37,000 in cash.

‘Apparently, Underwood knew Oakland kept cash in the house,’ Tobias said.

When Underwood got out of prison, the relationship became a problem for Oakland, police said.

The professor contacted police last month to file reports that he'd been defrauded by Underwood. Oakland told officers at the time that he knew Underwood had taken advantage of him, but wanted to help.

Oakland said he ‘just wanted to be a good Christian and help a poor man get back on his feet,’ according to police documents.

It wasn't immediately clear how Oakland said he had been defrauded.

Police said Underwood's wife, who is disabled, told police that her husband had a large bag of cash she believed he had taken from Oakland.

Scholar: Oakland was a prominent professor of education until his retirement in 2010, and a former Fulbright Scholar

‘She knew he was unemployed and had no funds of his own, and all of a sudden he had a bag of cash,’ Tobias said, adding that the woman is not being charged.

Oakland, a former Fulbright Scholar, was a prominent professor of education until his retirement in 2010, and president of the International Foundation for Children's Education, according to the university. He'd also authored or edited 12 book and hundreds of articles.

‘Dr. Oakland was an exemplary world-class scholar in the field of school psychology, and a dedicated teacher, researcher and mentor to his students during his 15 years as a College of Education faculty member,’ said Glenn Good, dean of the school's College of Education.

‘We will continue to be inspired by his extraordinary commitment to the college and his profession, his caring and love for his family, compassion for his students and graduates, and his grace and humor.’

Court records show Underwood Jr. has a long rap sheet dating back to at least 2007.

In 2014, he was convicted of swindling, fraud and dealing stolen property. He's also been convicted on drug charges, forgery and grand theft. 

Jean Crockett, director of the school's College of Education, told the Gainesville Sun that the 75-year-old educator was especially known for working with disabled children and adults both in the US and abroad.
