A bomb has killed four U.S. soldiers in 
southern Afghanistan as scores of presidential candidates registered for the country's first independent election next year.

The
 U.S.-led international military coalition had earlier said four of its 
service members were killed in the south, and a military official 
confirmed all were Americans killed by an 'improvised explosive device' today.

Their
 deaths bring the toll among foreign forces to 132 this year, of which 
102 are from the United States.

At least 2,146 members of the U.S. 
military have died in Afghanistan as a result of the U.S.-led invasion 
of Afghanistan in late 2001, according to an Associated Press count.

They are part of a total of nearly 3,390 coalition forces that have died
 during the conflict.

The 
attack came as Afghan security forces take over the brunt of the 
fighting after the coalition handed over security responsibilities for 
the country earlier this summer. This year, an average of least 100 
Afghan soldiers and police has died each week. 

The
 insurgency has tried to take advantage of the withdrawal of foreign 
forces to regain territory around the country. There are currently about
 87,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan, including around 52,000 
Americans.

That number is expected to be halved by February, with U.S. 
numbers going down to about 31,000.

Next year's elections for the country's top office vote will help determine the success or failure of all those 
years of U.S.-led military and political intervention in the country.

The news comes as a slew of political heavyweights, along with the Afghan president's 
brother and a number of former warlords, registered their presidential candidacy.

The critical April 5 vote
could determine the future course of the country and the level of 
foreign involvement in Afghanistan after 12 years of war.

Contender: Afghan President Hamid Karzai's brother, Abdul Qayyom Karzai (pictured), has registered his candidacy in next year's presidential election

The
 candidacies ended weeks of speculation over who will aspire to replace 
President Hamid Karzai, who has essentially run the country since the 
October 7, 2001 invasion that ousted the Taliban.

Karzai is not entitled to
 run for a third consecutive term, but is 
expected to back at least one of the candidates - his former Foreign 
Minister Zalmai Rassoul, despite the fact that his businessman brother 
Qayyum Karzai is also running for president.

The
 contenders are a mix of Afghanistan's past and current power players, 
including some warlords with a tainted history, a couple of technocrats 
and some complete political outsiders.

All
 the candidates have tried to shape tickets that attempt to unify an 
ethnically fractious political scene marked by patronage and alliances 
among the elite - a group who 
can marshal votes among the country's various ethnic groups.

The 
population of 31 million is roughly 42 percent Pashtun, 27 percent 
Tajik, nine per cent Hazara, and nine per cent Uzbek along with other, smaller 
factions. The Taliban are predominantly Pashtun.

Candidates
 declare tickets that include two vice presidents and will be reviewed 
by the Independent Electoral Commission before final approval on Novemver 
11. To run, candidates must have at least 100,000 signatures from all 34
 of Afghanistan's provinces.

By the end of 
the day and after a mad scramble by candidates and hundreds of 
supporters and heavily armed bodyguards, about 20 presidential 
candidates had registered for the first independent vote organized by 
Afghanistan without direct foreign assistance.

Top 
contenders include former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah, who was 
the runner up to President Hamid Karzai in the 2009 elections and 
dropped out just ahead of a runoff vote following allegations of massive
 fraud in the first round.

Out of the race: Afghan President Hamid Karzai is not allowed to run for a third consecutive term

Ashraf
 Ghani, a Pashtun former finance minister who oversaw the transition of 
security from foreign forces to the Afghan army and police. He weighed 
in with support from two of Afghanistan's ethnic groups.

His choices for
 vice president are Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former warlord who is 
thought to control the majority of the Uzbek vote and Sarwar Danish, a 
former justice minister who has the support of former Hazara warlord and
 vice president Mohammad Karim Khalili. Ghani ran and lost in the 2009 
elections.

Two former 
Afghan warlords are sharing a ticket, one for president, the other for 
vice president. They are Abdul Rab Rasoul Sayyaf, an influential Pashtun
 lawmaker and religious scholar, who is running for president along with
 former energy and water minister Ismail Khan, a Tajik.

Rassoul,
 a Pashtun, is running with Ahmad Zia Massoud, the brother of Ahmad Shah
 Massoud, the Northern Alliance commander killed in an al-Qaida suicide 
bombing two days before Sept. 11, 2001. Habiba Sarabi, a Hazara who was 
governor of Bamyan province and is one of five women vice presidential 
candidates, fills out the ticket.

Karzai's
 brother is also running with Wahidullah Shahrani, an Uzbek who was 
minister of mines, and Abrahim Qasimi, who was a Hazara member of 
parliament.

The
 registration came on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the invasion, 
which led to an insurgency that shows no signs of abatement and a war 
that has become largely forgotten in the United States and among its 
coalition allies, despite continued casualties suffered by their forces 
on the ground.

Billions
 of dollars in funds pledged to Afghanistan are tied to the government's
 holding transparent and credible elections, a challenge in a country 
rife with patronage and corruption and a resilient Taliban insurgency.

The Taliban have asked people not to vote and do not recognize the 
election process.
