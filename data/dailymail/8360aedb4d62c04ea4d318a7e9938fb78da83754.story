An unconscious woman raped by four Vanderbilt football players was 'thrown out like a piece of trash' once they were done with her, prosecutors said today as they wrapped up their case.

A jury in Nashville, Tennessee heard attorneys' closing arguments on Tuesday afternoon and must now decide whether to find Brandon Vandenburg, 21, and Cory Batey, who turned 21 today, guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery.

Last week, the alleged victim testified that Vandenburg, whom she was dating, plied her with alcohol one night in June 2013 and the next thing she remembers is waking up in a strange dorm room. 

The jury saw surveillance footage showing her being dragged to Vandenburg's dorm room.

Inside the room, Vandenburg switched on porn and encouraged Batey and two others to assault the woman with a water bottle and rape her, prosecutors said.

The jury was shown graphic cell phone footage of part of the alleged sexual attack, which the men had recorded. Vandenburg then sent some footage to friends. 

One of the men, Brandon Banks, allegedly anally raped the woman with the water bottle as Vandenburg said, 'squeeze that s***', the video showed. Batey then allegedly urinated on her.

'It wasn't just about sexual gratification and fun, it was about degrading her, humiliating her,' Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman said in his closing arguments on Tuesday.

The woman was then 'thrown in the hall like a piece of trash by the man she trusted, Brandon Vandenburg,' Thurman said.

'She's not a piece of trash,' he continued. 'She's a victim. Not an alleged victim. A victim. A victim that had the courage to take that stand and face her attackers. A victim that had the courage to come in here and fight for justice.'

The woman testified last week that she could not remember any of the attack.

Throughout the trial, the defense had argued that the men had become swept up in a promiscuous college culture, where people walked around naked and binged on alcohol. 

Questions: On Monday, Batey, pictured as he testified on the stand, said he blacked out from drinking so much on the night of the attack and could not remember what had happened

But Thurman said that was not the culture that was revealed during the trial.

'The culture you really saw was entitled athletes thinking rules don't apply to them, that's the real culture you saw here,' he told the court on Tuesday. 'Their mindset that they could get away with anything. "The rules don't apply to us".' 

Defense attorneys for the men had also argued that due to the copious amounts of alcohol they had consumed - one estimate put Batey's consumption at as many as 22 drinks - they were not aware of their surroundings.

Batey took the stand on Monday and claimed he had 'blacked out' and didn't remember what happened that night in Vandenburg's dorm room until he later saw cellphone images.

'I was just drunk out of my mind,' Batey testified. 'This is something I would never do in my right state of mind. I'm just sorry.' 

But Thurman dismissed the claim, pointing out that Batey had lucidly texted a friend to say he wanted a quesadilla - with the word correctly spelled - just 30 minutes before the alleged attack. 

He then went for a shower and made phone calls to friends before hanging out with his girlfriend. 

'Attackers': Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused in the rape case

Regrets? McKenzie also took the stand during his teammates' trial and insisted he had not touched the girl

'Is that a blackout?' Thurman asked. 'Is that a person who doesn't know what he's doing? Is that a person who's not acting knowingly?' 

Similarly, he said that Vandenburg had been drinking, yet nobody during the trial testified that he was not aware of his surroundings.

In the aftermath of the attack, Vandenburg pressured his friends to delete the graphic videos and attempted to destroy evidence on cellphones and computers, prosecutors said. He also emailed the victim and pressured her not to say anything negative about him, they said.

'Are those the actions of a person who is not criminally responsible?' Thurman asked. 'There's an inference of guilt when you attempt to destroy evidence... Innocent people don't destroy evidence.' 

But Vandenburg's attorney interpreted his client's attempts to destroy the photos a different way.

'He at least had the sense afterwards to be upset about it,' Fletcher Long told the jury. 

Injuries: Katherine Parnell, a nurse at Metro General who carried out a rape kit on the victim, said the young woman had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, and scratches on her feet

He also insisted that Vandenburg had not penetrated the woman so could not be found guilty of rape. Vandenburg had consumed too much alcohol to be able to rape her, according to earlier testimony.

Long added that there was not enough evidence that Vandenburg had encouraged the other men to rape the woman. 

The jury will now have to decide whether Vandenburg should be convicted of rape even though he didn't penetrate the victim, and whether Batey was so drunk that he could not have formed the intent to commit the crime.

'I care what the law is, and they haven't met it,' Long said in his closing arguments.

All four men are charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with tampering with evidence and unlawful photography.

All four have pleaded not guilty, including the two men not on trial: Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks. McKenzie also testified at the trial, saying he didn't touch the woman but took pictures.

A trial date for the two men has not yet been set.
