The family of the only Ebola patient to die in the U.S. have reached a settlement with the hospital which botched his treatment for an undisclosed amount.

A foundation has been set up in honor of Thomas Eric Duncan which will assist other Ebola victims in West Africa, family attorney Les Weisbrod said on Wednesday in Dallas, Texas

The foundation is part of a larger settlement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital that will 'take care' of Duncan's four children and his parents, the attorney said, but did not reveal how much the settlement was worth.

Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancee who was quarantined at her home following his diagnosis and then struggled to find a new place to live,  will not receive anything in the settlement.

Thomas Eric Duncan died on October 8 from Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. The Liberian man was initially sent away from the hospital's emergency room with antibiotics which authorities admitted was a mistake

Mr Weisbrod told reporters the hospital 'wanted to do the right thing'. Details of the deal were not
released and the family will not be billed for his care, the attorney said.

Hospital officials said a settlement had been reached but did not provided details.

Duncan died on October 8. The Liberian man was initially sent away from the hospital's emergency room with antibiotics, something hospital administrators have acknowledged was a mistake.

Texas Health has already apologized to Mr Duncan's family. 

Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, has previously been critical of the care Duncan received, saying his death was partly due to his race, nationality and lack of insurance.

But on Wednesday, he credited Presbyterian's officials for moving quickly to settle the case and acknowledge mistakes. 

Mr Weeks said he will be 'the face of the foundation', which he hopes will lead to a new hospital or the dedication of a hospital wing in Liberia.

'The main focus is that Eric's name is on something and everybody knows that he didn't die in vain,' he said.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas confirmed the creation of the foundation in a statement and said it has 'amicably addressed all matters' with Duncan's family.

The hospital has apologized for releasing Duncan the first time, and after initially denying he had told them he was from West Africa, they acknowledged key caregivers missed his travel history in their record system.

Duncan's sister, Mai Wureh, said that the hospital had satisfied her request for the remainder of her brother's medical records, including lab results of his treatment with the experimental drug brincidofovir.

Wureh also said she and Weeks met Wednesday morning with John Mulligan, the nurse who administered the drug.

'He gave me closure because he was the last one in that room. He was able to talk to him, comfort him. He held onto him, and that made me feel better. At least he didn't die alone,' Wureh said.

A suit against the Dallas hospital faced long odds due to the state's regulations on malpractice suits that have made it one of the hardest places in the United States to sue over medical errors, especially those that occur in the emergency room, according to plaintiffs' lawyers and legal experts. 

Duncan, a Liberian national who arrived in the
United States, first sought treatment at Texas Health
Presbyterian Hospital in late September, telling staff he had
come from Liberia, one of three West African countries hit
hardest by the Ebola outbreak there.

He was infected when he helped a pregnant neighbor in Monrovia seek hospital treatment

Two days after he was discharged, Duncan had to be carted
back to the same hospital by ambulance, and became the first
person in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus.

He
was placed in an isolation unit and died 10 days after being
admitted, with teams of medical staff tending to his care.

Two nurses who treated Duncan, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson,
both contracted Ebola and later recovered.

The hospital apologized to Duncan's family for not being
able to save his life and said it made a mistake by initially
discharging him.

The Ebola outbreak has killed more than 4,900 people so far
this year, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

From her home in Monrovia, Liberia, Mr Duncan's sister made an extraordinary attack on U.S. doctors in an interview with MailOnline. 

'He died like a dog': Mary Pearson, 52, sister of Thomas Eric Duncan, who became the first U.S. victim of Ebola. She believes he was allowed to die in revenge for bringing the virus to America

Texas Health announced today that his family will be taken care of as part of the settlement

Grieving Mary Pearson claimed that the deadly virus was created as part of an experiment to infect black people on the continent - echoing the views of a race-hate preacher who says Ebola was invented to 'depopulate' Africa. 

America invented the Ebola virus to 'kill Africans' and deliberately left victim Duncan to die 'like a dog' in revenge for bringing the disease into the U.S, Mrs Pearson claimed.

Mrs Pearson insisted that her brother did not receive the same level of care as American citizens who had contracted the disease and were taken back to the US for treatment. 

Of the nine people who have been treated for Ebola in the U.S., only Duncan has died and his nephew Josephus Weeks said: 'We begged. We pleaded. I even offered my own blood, even though it wouldn't do anything for him. We requested everything we could think of to save Eric. They said no.'

Mrs Pearson said: 'Eric suffered in exile and it really hurts me.They didn't feel sorry for him. They didn't give him drugs. They had the means to treat him but they treated him like a dog.

'They are wicked. They didn't treat him because they said he brought Ebola to America.'
