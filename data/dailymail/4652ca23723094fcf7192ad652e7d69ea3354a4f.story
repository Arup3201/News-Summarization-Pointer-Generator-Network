Boost: Investor Carl Icahn tweeted he had bought Apple shares and withing three hours the value rocked by $17bn

Apple's shares rocketed by $17billion in less than two hours after a legendary U.S. investor tweeted he had bought a large stake in the company.

Carl Icahn told his 40,000 followers he was backing the business and said its price was 'undervalued', kick-starting a chain reaction that sent the markets wild.

At around 1pm yesterday Apple shares were valued at around $472billion, but by 4pm they hit $489billion, a rise of 4.75 per cent.

He sent the message at 2.21pm, causing a rise of $171million every minute until the market closed.

The activist investor also said her had a 'nice conversation' with CEO Tim Cook about a larger stock buyback, sending the company's shares to a near seven-month high.

He had told Cook that he should return a large amount of the company's cash reserves to shareholders.

Icahn did not say how many shares he has amassed. Rules require investors to disclose stakes of five per cent or larger within 10 days of hitting that threshold.

'Had a nice conversation with Tim Cook today. Discussed my opinion that a larger buyback should be done now,' Icahn tweeted. 'We plan to speak again shortly.'

'We currently have a large position in Apple. We believe the company to be extremely undervalued.'

The billionaire with a reputation for pushing aggressive corporate 
change said on Twitter he planned to talk more with Cook, who has 
presided over a sharp fall in the share price over the past year.

Catalyst: The legend of Wall Street sent this message to his 40,000 followers, which saw the market surge upwards

Conversation: Icahn also revealed he had a meeting with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, where he told him to give back cash to shareholders

Fragile: Apple's shares were $700 last year but were at $400 in June after a loss of market support

Apple has for a long time been the darling of the technology market, with the phenomenal success of its products.

Last September shares were priced at $700 each but this was at $400 in June after the markets were spooked because it appeared they lacked a new dynamite product.

The boost yesterday is in stark contrast with the fortunes of rival BlackBerry.

It has put itself up for sale as the struggling smartphone maker seeks to revive the fortunes of its ailing brand.

The handset revolutionised mobile phone technology when it was introduced in 1999 but its popularity was badly dented by the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007 and has since lost out to Android phones as well as Microsoft's Windows device.

The Canadian handset maker has failed to lure consumers to buy its BlackBerry 10 devices, which were meant to reverse the fortune of the company.
