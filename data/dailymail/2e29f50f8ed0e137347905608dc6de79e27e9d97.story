He was arguably Manchester City's third choice striker at the beginning of the season, but Edin Dzeko's clinical finishing has taken the club to within a point of returning the Premier League title to the Etihad.

The Bosnian international scored an opening brace during City's resounding 4-0 victory over Aston Villa in their penultimate game of the season - leaving them needing only a draw against West Ham to be crowned champions.

Dzeko's two goals took his tally for the season to 26 in all competitions (16 league goals) - not a bad return for a player who has frequently been linked with a move and bristles at the term of 'super-sub'.

Clinical: Edin Dzeko's brace in Man City's 4-0 win against Aston Villa takes them to within a point of the title

Invisible man? Dzeko's heat map is not that impressive, but it's finding the right space that sets him apart

The 28-year-old can appear almost invisible during games, especially when teams employ the sort of defensive spoiling tactics that Aston Villa used to strangle the first-half.

In fact, Dzeko's heat map for his entire game doesn't assume greatness - but it is the 6ft 4in striker's ability to be in the right place at the right time and clinical finishing that sets him apart.

He only managed two shots on target during the entire game... but scored with both.

Will Manchester City win the Premier League?

Dzeko could have opened the scoring earlier when a lofted ball from Yaya Toure sent him into acres of space with only the keeper to beat, but he failed to take the ball down as exquisitely as perhaps the absent Sergio Aguero might.

Nonetheless, Dzeko's attributes come alive in the six yard box and that is where both of his goals were netted from - with both coming from crosses made by the formidable Pablo Zabaleta.

The Argentininean deserves praise for his relentless running that gave his team an attacking outlet throughout the game without ignoring his defensive responsibilities on the rare occasion that Villa moved out of their own half.

Right on time: Zabaleta patrolled his flank with absolute authority, spending more time in Villa's half

For the first goal, City patiently probed before David Silva played in Zabaleta on the right 
and his squared cross left Dzeko with a simple finish from close 
range to break the deadlock on 64minutes.

The second came only eight minutes later and started with the same link up play between Silva and Zabaleta before ending with Dzeko reacting quickest to Samir Nasri's deflected shot - again only inches from the goal line.

As well as Dzeko and Zabaleta, City's other outstanding performer was, typically, Yaya Toure.

The Ivorian midfielder is the league's ultimate all-rounder. No other player can combine theÂ  athleticism of his surging runs from midfield with the delicacy of his passing and power of his shooting - while he also takes a mean free-kick.

Eventually, there may even be a position named after him in the same way that Claude Makele became a byword for holding midfielder.

The game's final goal perhaps epitomises Toure's strength, seizing the ball from midfield before leaving defenders in his wake to slot home his 20th goal of the season and, incredibly, the team's 100th league goal.

Come Sunday, Dzeko will have a last opportunity to add to that total, pick up a second Premier League winner's medal... and no doubt raise himself in the perceived pecking order at Manchester City next season.
