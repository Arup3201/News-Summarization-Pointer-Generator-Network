Going toe-to-toe, these fighting primates could give Floyd Mayweather a run for his money.

Astounding images captured by Australian tourist Julie Rathbone show a pair of Chacma baboons-some of the largest and most violent primates in the world-embroiled in a heated brawl on the banks of the Zambezi river in Africa.

The brawling baboons appeared to have settled the disagreement by fighting, before a senior baboon plays referee and steps in to break it up.

Nurse unit manager Julie Rathbone, 59, from New South Wales, was on a cruise down the river when she spotted the row unfolding.

She quickly whipped out her camera to capture the dust-up - but said it was difficult to keep up with the speedy youngsters.

'We were following hippos along the edge of the river when the noise of the monkey's playing attracted my attention,' she said.

'Once the fight ended they all quietened down and sat around in groups as if nothing had happened.' 

'They appeared to be playing but one seemed to upset the others and they all went haywire and started chasing each other.

Chacma Baboons are the largest baboons and among the largest monkey species in the world.

Males are frequently violent and aggressive towards both male and females as well as humans, giving rise to a spate of hunting incidents in South Africa's Southern Cape Peninsula . 

Rathbone said she felt lucky to have captured the moment on camera and said it was 'extremely exhilarating.'

'I was quite excited to be in the right place at the right time and was able to get a reasonable amount of frames in focus,' she said.

'The only other time I have seen monkeys interact with each other has been in the zoo so watching them in their own environment, completely unrestrained and free from fences was an exhilarating experience.' 

The NSW nurse said she felt lucky to have captured the moment on camera and said it was 'extremely exhilarating'
