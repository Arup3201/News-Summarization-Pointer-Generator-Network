Cheering, smiling and, ultimately, grimacing, Sophie Wessex was the Queen's loudest supporter today as her filly Estimate attempted to retain the Gold Cup title she won last year.

But unfortunately for the Countess, her efforts were in vain with the horse narrowly missing out to Irish contender Leading Light in the most prestigious race on Ladies' Day.

Consolation for the Queen came in the form of a family day out, with Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and the Princess Royal joining the monarch and the Countess of Wessex in the Royal Box.

Right: Princess Eugenie waves to the crowds

Looking
 lovely: The Princess Royal was chic in a bright pink hat and navy blue

Cant

While the Queen might not have managed a win on the racecourse, she took home the prizes in the style stakes with her brightest ensemble of the week so  far - a turquoise Angela Kelly coat and matching Rachel Trevor-Morgan hat.

The Countess of Wessex, by contrast, went for dark glamour in a black calf-length dress and a matching hat, using pearl earrings to take the sombre edge off the look.

Meanwhile, Princess Beatrice joined the Queen and plumped for brights courtesy of a cream 
coat and a tangerine Sarah Cant hat, while Princess Eugenie plumped for pale and interesting in a beige trench coat and a matching pillbox hat by Welsh milliner, Robyn Coles.

Glamorous
 though the York princesses were, all eyes were on the Princess Royal 
who joined them in the carriage and looked marvellous in a fuchsia 
titfer and a navy blue coat delicately patterned with flowers.

Despite her losses on the field, the Queen did at least have Prince Harry on hand to entertain her and he did - jinking across the Royal Enclosure, twirling an umbrella in his hand, and regaling his family with tales. 

Commiserations:

Wonderful:

feathers and beading, a matching pink shift dress, and a pared down navy
 jacket

Day
 out: The Princess Royal, who has been at Royal Ascot every day, was 
joined by her nieces Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie for the ride
 down the racecourse

Joker: Prince Harry's antics kept his 
grandparents and uncle Prince Andrew entertained as they drove along the
 course - and he carried on in the Royal Enclosure

Also on 
hand for the fun was Peter Phillips who laughed along with Prince Harry 
as they cheered on Frankie Dettori in the Norfolk Stakes before bursting
 into laughter as he dropped the trophy during the subsequent 
presentation.

And while she
 might not have won, the Queen, who later presented Leading Light's 
owners with the Gold Cup, does at least have happy 
memories of last year's race - and wrote glowingly of her experiences in
 
last year's event in the official foreword to the Ascot programme,

'I would like to thank those of you who 
were here for the wonderful welcome the filly received after performing 
so well, and also those who were kind enough to send messages 
afterwards,' she wrote.

'To win at
 Royal Ascot is challenging and I know how much work goes into preparing
 every one of the horses racing. All those involved deserve great credit
 as well as our gratitude.'

And
 the Queen certainly does know a considerable amount about readying 
racehorses for action, thanks to a career as a breeder and owner that 
spans more than 60 years.

Since inheriting a handful of animals on her father's death in 1952, her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races, 
including all five British Classics apart from the Epsom 
Derby, although did manage a second place finish with Aureole in 
1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton House.

While
the Derby has so far eluded her, the Queen has bred some of the finest 
horses ever to race in the UK, among them Dunfermline who managed to win
both the Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who 
triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 
Guineas in 1958.
