A 2-year-old boy and three adults between the ages of 19 and 22 were found shot to death at a house in Richmond, Virginia, Wednesday in what police are calling a murder-suicide.

Police responded to 100 East Roanoke Street at around 8.20pm to discover two women, a toddler and a man dead from gunshot wounds.

The victims have been identified as 22-year-old Michelle Kelly and her 2-year-old son, Keytrell Kelly, 19-year-old Adreena Gary and 21-year-old Traymont Burton.

Crime scene: The massacre took place at 100 East Roanoke Street in Richmond, Virginia 

According to police, Gary's body was lying outside the residence while the three others were indoors. All four were pronounced dead at the scene.

‘Burton and Michelle Kelly were ex-romantic partners and parents of Keytrell. Gray was a friend of Michelle Kelly.’ Richmond police wrote in a news release.

Richmond Police spokesperson Gene Lepley said investigators are confident that Traymont Burton shot his girlfriend, their son and Michelle Kelly’s friend before turning the gun on himself.

‘Everyone who knows “Dreeny” knows how great she is. She's a helpful person, and apparently that's what she was doing tonight is trying to help a friend,’ Adreena Gary's sister Claryce Gary told NBC12. ‘I know there will be no justice. There can't be, and that's what makes it so hard.’

Claryce Gary has launched an online fundraiser asking for donations to help with her sister’s final expenses.

Big plans: Adreena's sister said the 19-year-old was a criminal justice student who aspired to become a lawyer 

Gary wrote on GoFunMe.com that her 19-year-old sister was studying criminal justice at J. Seargent Reynolds Community College and was hoping to become a lawyer once day.

According to Claryce Grey, on the night of the quadruple murder-suicide, Adreena went to Michelle Kelly’s house to help through a domestic dispute with her boyfriend.

‘Dreena you are and have always been one of the sweetest and most thoughtful people I've ever known and I just wish I could seek justice for you,’ a heartbroken Claryce wrote on her Facebook page.
