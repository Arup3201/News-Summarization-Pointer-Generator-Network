Ex-army Colonel Patrick Mercer yesterday became the first Tory MP to be named as having written to party chiefs calling for David Cameron to be ousted as Conservative leader.

Former Tory Defence spokesman Mr Mercer has written to Graham Brady, chairman of the Party’s backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a confidence vote in Mr Cameron. The disclosure follows reports that as many as 14 Tory MPs have urged similar action in writing. 

Under Conservative rules, if 46 MPs follow Mr Mercer’s example, it would trigger a full-scale vote of all Conservative MPs on whether to ditch Mr Cameron.

Mr Brady told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I never comment about this sort of thing to anyone.’

Some Tories are urging Right-winger Mr Brady himself to stand against Mr Cameron. Brian Binley, treasurer of the 1922 Committee and one of the Prime Minister’s most outspoken critics, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘At some stage there will be a need for a new leader. Graham Brady is among a number of names being mentioned.’ Mr Brady dismissed such reports as ‘nonsense’.

Two Cabinet Ministers also  urged Mr Cameron to appoint Mr Brady, a leading Eurosceptic, as Minister for Europe in the recent Cabinet reshuffle.

However, it is believed that Mr Brady turned down the post after it was made clear he would not be given Cabinet status.

Not plotting: Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox moved to quash reports that he is among a group of Right-wing MPs plotting against Mr Cameron

Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox also moved last night to quash reports that he is among a group of Right-wing MPs plotting against  Mr Cameron.

One MP said he had been approached by a group of rebels and informed that a challenge could be mounted against Mr Cameron if the Tories suffer big losses in next year’s town hall elections. The MP said: ‘I was told that Liam Fox is among those who could be involved.’

Dr Fox insisted reports that he was in the anti-Cameron camp were ‘absolute rubbish’.
