This is the first glimpse inside the luxurious 42-storey Meier-on-Rothschild Tower - the residential skyscraper billed as the One Hyde Park of Tel Aviv.

The building, located in the commercial Rothschild Boulevard area of the city, boasts 141 luxury two to eight-bedroom apartments - many of which have already been snapped up by some of world's richest people.

Located at the very top of the 590ft tower -  designed by Pritzker Prize-Winning international architect Richard Meier - are three £32million penthouses, complete with swimming pools, cocktail bars, and even private cinemas.

One is rumored to have been sold off-plan to Nat Rothschild - the British-born billionaire and member of the notorious investment banking family.

Mr Rothschild, who was educated at Colet 
Court and was in the same year as Chancellor of the Exchequer George 
Osborne, is thought to be using the apartment as his summer residence 
when he is in the Mediterranean.

fortune. In 2011, The Sunday Times estimated his personal wealth to be 
around £1billion.

Developers of the residential skyscraper Berggruen –
owned by US billionaire Nicolas Berggruen – have decided to officially launch
the spectacular penthouses in London.

Beauchamp Estates, which specialises in super-prime property will be marketing the properties.

Gary Hersham, Managing Partner of Beauchamp Estates said: 'Specialising in super-prime and with offices in London, the French Riviera and Tuscany, Beauchamp Estates is uniquely placed to handle the international sales for the penthouses.

'Tel Aviv is a vibrant “sister-city” to Barcelona on the eastern end of the same sea.

'These luxurious apartments combine Manhattan and Knightsbridge quality with a spectacular Mediterranean setting.'  

The Rothschild family descends from Mayer Amschel Rothschild - a court Jew to the Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel who began his banking business in the 1760s.

Rothschild established an international banking dynasty through his five sons, and eventually made the family one of the most powerful of the era.

Many of the family have been elevated to members of nobility, especially in Austria.

During the 19th century the Rothschild family was believed to have the largest private fortune in the world.

The family's wealth is thought to have subsequently declined, mainly because it was divided amongst hundreds of descendants.

Today, the Rothschild businesses are on a far smaller scale although they encompass a diverse range of fields, including finance, mining, energy, mixed farming, wine, and charities.

Nathaniel Philip Rothschild is the youngest of four and only son of Jacob Rothschild.

His maternal grandparents were Lady Mary Sybil St. Clair-Erskine, daughter of James St Clair-Erskine, 5th Earl of Rosslyn and Sir Philip Gordon Dunn, 2nd Baronet, whose father was the Canadian financier and tycoon, Sir James Dunn.

Educated at Colet Court, he was in the same year as George Osborne. He went to Oxford and read history.

Rothschild has numerous investments - mainly in the mining and metals industries. Over his many years in business, he has been linked to Glencore, Genel Energy and Volex.

He was instrumental in developing Atticus Capital, an international investment management firm established in 1995 and, especially over the past 10 years, has been involved in the growth and development of Vallar Plc.
