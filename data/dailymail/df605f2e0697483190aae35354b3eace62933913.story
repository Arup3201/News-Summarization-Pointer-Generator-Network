Susan Watkins is planning her first holiday for six years after winning £25,000 in the Daily Mail’s Scrabble competition.

Mrs Watkins, 56, landed the prize after completing three words using the letters she was given on her Scrabble game card in Saturday's Weekend magazine. 

She said she 'felt stunned' by her magnificent win. 'I don’t think it has quite sunk in yet,' she added. 'It will mean a lot to me. It will change my life, literally.'

Susan Watkins plans to spend her winnings on a holiday to Holland. She won the money with three words

Mrs Watkins, a community healthcare assistant, will use some of her winnings to pay for a holiday - her first since her husband Eddie died in 2009. 

She plans to go to Holland where her husband's brother is buried. He died in 1943 during the Second World War when the Lancaster bomber he was in was shot down over a Dutch village.

'The Dutch have their remembrance day on May 4 so I would like to be there this year for it,' she said. 

Mrs Watkins struggled to find a well-paying job after her husband died and will use the rest of her winnings to pay off bank loans.

‘I have been one wage packet away from the street for the last few years,’ she said.

'Wages are a bit unsure at the moment, so winning will certainly help,' she added. 

Mrs Watkins used the letters on her Scrabble game card to spell out 'heal', 'amiss', and 'badger. 

She said: 'I thought I had got one word and then I saw I'd got two and then I realised I'd got three.'
