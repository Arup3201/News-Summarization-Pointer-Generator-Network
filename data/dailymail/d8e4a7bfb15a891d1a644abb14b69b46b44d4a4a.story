Many black or racially mixed women in Venezuela are undergoing nose jobs in an effort to look whiter.

A Dartmouth College study found that cosmetic surgery is on the rise in the South American country because women value whiteness and are obsessed with physical appearance.

The rhinoplasty procedure, which women believe will give them 'the perfectly-formed nose', does however only temporarily improve their self-esteem and body image.

This fixation with how they look prompts many women to undergo cosmetic surgery such as face lifts, nose jobs and liposuction.

The study, by assistant professor of anthropology Lauren Gulbas, looked at how British ideals of beauty affected ideas about race in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela.

Focusing on rhinoplasty, the article, titled Embodying Racism: Race, Rhinoplasty, and Self-Esteem in Venezuela, included 63 white, black or racially mixed women.

Out of these women, 24 had undergone rhinoplasty and 39 wanted to.

Every single one of the women desired the perfect nose, which they described as tall, slender and associated with being white.

All of the black or racially mixed women with broad, flat noses wanted this type of nose to improve their self-esteem by looking whiter.

Gulbas says that Venezuelan national heritage prioritises European features such as light skin.

'Rhinoplasty is offered by physicians and interpreted by patients as a resolution to body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem.

'Patients' efforts to alter the nose reveal attempts to change not only how the body looks, but how it is lived.

'As a result, cosmetic surgery only acts as a stop-gap measure to heighten one's self-esteem and body image,' she writes.

The new trend has, however, sparked 
controversy and the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez even laid the blame
on cosmetic surgeons for putting pressure on Venezuelan women to 
undergo treatments that they can't afford.

And it isn't just in Venezuela that the surgery is rife.

Iran has recently been named the nose job capital
of the world - with seven times more operations carried out there than 
in America - despite the high cost of the surgery.

Young women in Iran, some as young as 14, are having cosmetic surgery in the hope of attaining the Hollywood 'doll face'.
