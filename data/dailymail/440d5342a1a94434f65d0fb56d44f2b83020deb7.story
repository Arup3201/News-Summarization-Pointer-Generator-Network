Wall Street Journal editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz gave an impassioned attack on Citi Bike, the New York City bike sharing program, criticizing Major Bloomberg and cyclists

When asked by the host ofÂ Wall Street Journal Live why she thought the local government would want to implement a program like this, Rabinowitz came out swinging replying, 'Do not ask me to enter the minds of the totalitarians running this government of the city.'She went on to attack Bloomberg for his support of the program and bemoan the damage she felt it had done to the city.'Envision what happens when you get a government that is run by an autocratic major before which you are helpless,' she said. 'We now look at a city who's best neighborhoods are absolutely begrimed by these blazing blue Citibank bikes.'Noting the number of bike stands the went up around the city, the moderator added that the bays are fire hazards for firetrucks who can no longer park close to some subway stations.Rabinowitz continued her rant, blasting cyclists for not obeying traffic laws in the city, citing that they often veer from designated bike lanes on to pedestrian sidewalks.

Rabinowitz said that the 'blazing blue' Citi Bikes, seen here, 'begrimed' the city's best neighborhoods

'The most important danger in this city is not the yellow cabs it is the bicyclists,' she said, 'empowered by the city administration with the idea that they are privileged because they are part of all the good forward looking things.'Despite his critics Bloomberg praised the new green initiative during a Memorial Day parade in Queens.'This is going to be phenomenally popular,' Bloomberg said, according to a report from The Daily News.The first wave of the Citi Bike plan will put 6,000 bikes at 330 docking bays below 59th Street and in downtown Brooklyn.

Rabinowitz also vehemently criticized Major Bloomberg and his support of the bike sharing program, calling an 'autocratic major before which [New Yorkers] are helpless'

New York City residents can rent bikes around the city for a yearly fee of $95. Daily rental passes are also available for short-term bikers. Rabinowitz failed to be moved by the city's initiative, which in her view is aimed to make people feel like they are living in a European city.'If the major had had any guts he would have undertaken a study, but he knew [the citizens] were against it,' she fired.'I represent the majority of citizens, the majority of citizens of this city are appalled by what happened,' Rabinowitz said.'The fact that a city is helpless before the driven, personal, and ideological passions of its leader in the interest, allegedly, of the good of the city, can take many forms, but we have seen the most dramatic exposition of this in our city ...''With the latest example of this being the bike share program,' the moderator finished.
