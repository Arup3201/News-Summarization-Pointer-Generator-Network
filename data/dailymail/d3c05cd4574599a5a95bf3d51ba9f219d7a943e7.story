As the popular ITV drama Downton Abbey is set in an era before make-up was commonplace, the ladies of the manor have to showcase a natural look.

But with the glare of the on-set lights and the need to look fresh and glamorous at all times, the stars of course wear cosmetics.  

Now Laura Carmichael, 28, who plays Lady Edith, has revealed the tricks of the trade that are used by the show's make-up artist Magi Vaughan.

Twenties-inspired: Lisa Eldridge gives actress Laura Carmichael a natural make-over, left, recreating her style from Downton Abbey series three, right

Laura shares the secrets with make-up artist Lisa Eldridge as she recreates her natural look from series three.

In a video tutorial using Laura as her model, Lisa uses products widely available to buy so people without their own professorial make-up artist can get the look at home.

Lisa said she wanted to recreate Lady Edith's natural style because she's 'a big fan of the show and I have made up lots of the female cast for cover shoots and red carpet events'.

Downtown Abbey series three was set in 1920-21, an era when most women didn't wear make-up. 

Laura said: 'We were always asking for a bit more lip or blush in the make-up chair but we're not allowed. It would just look wrong.' 

Lisa explains: 'Women in the early 20s didn't wear make-up and it was associated with actresses and women of ill-repute.' 

Get the look: On the set of Downton, an air brush is used but Lisa uses make-up brushes

As a result, the Downton Abbey actresses needed to have a realistic, natural look (although in the current series set later in the twenties they can wear more make-up as it was beginning to catch on). 

To achieve natural look, Magi used an air brush - where make-up is sprayed on instead of applied using brushes and sponges.

Laura said of getting air brushed in the make-up chair every day: 'You do get used to it but it's weird to begin with and the guys find it hilarious. But you can do a lot with it in terms of shading.'  

Lisa chose not to use an air brush, opting instead to use L'Oreal Infallible Foundation, applied with a make-up brush so people can more easily copy her.

She also uses Laura Mercier SC1 Secret Camouflage concealer and Chanel loose powder.

Lisa then applies Daniel Sandler's Water Colour Blush Cherub to Laura's cheeks.

Subtle effect: Lipstick Queen Medieval is used to stain the lips 

She explains: 'It's important for this look to be rosy, pretty but natural and healthy looking. Women at the time would have pinched their cheeks to create that rosy glow without make up.'

For the eyes, Lisa then uses Stila In The Know Eyeshadow Palette 'rain' shade, using a brush to avoid lines, then adds the darker 'driftwood' shade along the lower and upper lash line.

She defines Laura's eyebrows with Rimmel Brow This Way powder then curls her eye lashes.

Laura reveals that on the show, they are often not allowed to wear mascara so instead they tint their eyelashes. When they do wear mascara for a special occasion, it's brown or clear. 

The true natural look: Lisa before the make-over

Voila! The actress was happy with the result

Lisa replicates this by using Chanel brown mascara then little bit of clear mascara.

Finally to finish the look, Lisa adds Lipstick Queen Medieval. She explains how this gives a 'subtle berry effect like you've just eaten, so it's a natural stain.'

She then uses a No7 nude lip pencil to add definition to the lip line - another trick used on the Downton set.

Unveiling Laura's make-over, the actress says she's pleased with the result.  

'It's perfect, natural but pretty. I love the lip colour,' she said.
