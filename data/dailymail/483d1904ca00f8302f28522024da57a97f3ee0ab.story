Thirty drug smugglers have been sentenced to death in Vietnam for trafficking more than 12 tons of heroin in the communist country's largest-ever narcotics case.

The 21 men and nine women, all Vietnamese, were found guilty of drug trafficking, while a further 59 defendants were handed sentences ranging up to life in prison.

Each appeared flanked by two police officers at the mass trial in Quang Ninh province, which was held in the yard of a detention centre, rather than a courtroom.

'This was Vietnam's largest ever trial in terms of defendants, the number of death penalties given out and the amount of heroin involved,' presiding judge Ngo Duc said after the verdict was read out in the northern province of Quang Ninh - which borders China.

'Because
 of the large number of defendants and the seriousness of the case, the 
trial was held at the prison,' Mr Duc added after the 17-day trial.

Investigators
 said the defendants belonged to four international smuggling rings 
responsible for trafficking heroin and other drugs from neighbouring 
Laos into Vietnam and China since 2006.

'All
 the defendants are Vietnamese and most of them came from Vietnam's 
northwestern provinces,' court clerk Nguyen Trung Hieu told AFP.

Vietnam's
 remote northwestern region, which borders both China and Laos, is poor 
and populated by a patchwork of ethnic minority groups.

There have been previous smuggling cases in the area, which is far from the control of Hanoi.

According
 to a list of the defendants' names seen by AFP, some of the 89 people 
were from ethnic minority groups but court officials could not confirm 
their status.

One of the leaders of the four smuggling rings broken up by the police remains at large, state media reported.

Police disrupted the rings in August 2013, making mass arrests and seizing large quantities of illegal drugs.

They also confiscated 20 luxury cars and dozens of guns and other weapons during the raid, state media reported.

Communist Vietnam has some of the world's toughest anti-drug laws.

Anyone
 found guilty of possessing more than 600 grams (21 ounces) of heroin, 
or more than 20 kilograms of opium, can face the death penalty.

Convictions and sentences are usually revealed only by local media, which is strictly under state control.

Thirteen received life in jail and 46 were given either prison terms of up to 20 years, or warnings, the government said in a statement on its Internet site

The
 'Golden Triangle' region covering part of Laos, Thailand and Myanmar 
was formerly one of the world's top producers of opium and heroin but 
has been overtaken by Afghanistan.

After
 a two-year hiatus in carrying out capital punishment due to problems 
procuring chemicals for lethal injections, Vietnam executed its first 
prisoner by the method last August.

The country currently now has more than 700 prisoners on death row, according to media reports and an AFP tally.

Many
 have been sentenced for drug offences including dozens of foreigners - 
although it has been decades since a foreign citizen was executed.

Although
 Vietnam does not release statistics on executions, rights group Amnesty
 International recorded 86 new death sentences in 2012 while it said 
five executions were carried out the previous year.

Amnesty
 said it was 'dismayed' to learn about the sentences, which come on top 
of recent death sentences handed out in high-profile corruption and 
embezzlement cases.

'Amnesty
 International opposes the death penalty in all cases, without 
exception,' Rupert Abbott, its researcher on Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam,
 told AFP.

'Rather than 
continuing to hand down death sentences, the Vietnamese authorities 
should be moving towards abolition, in line with the global trend,' he 
added.

Due to problems with 
both procuring and producing domestically the chemicals required for 
lethal injections, some lawmakers have called for a return to executions
 by firing squad.
