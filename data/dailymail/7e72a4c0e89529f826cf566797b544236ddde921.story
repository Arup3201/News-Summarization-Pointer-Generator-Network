Rosenfield is alleged to have admitted to officers in Casper, Wyoming, that she had sex six times with the boy.

When she made her first appearance in court she was accompanied by her husband and mother.

An arrest report revealed that Rosenfield reported to Casper police she had been engaging in sexual intercourse with the boy since August.

The boy went into greater details with social workers, according to court documents.
