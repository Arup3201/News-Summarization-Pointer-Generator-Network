Disney have developed a new, wheeled robot that can create enormous drawings in the sand.

The robot — called the Beachbot — works by dragging a set of pins through the sand, like a rake.

Each pin is individually raisable, allowing the contraption to draw lines of varying thicknesses.

A 'canvas' is created by setting down poles, which the robot uses as markers to calculate its position.

Images are designed on an iPhone or tablet app which can then transmit the data to the machine.

It then takes around 10 minutes to create the artwork.

The Beachbot moves on a set of large, soft wheels that Disney has dubbed 'balloon wheels', allowing it to move across the sand without leaving tracks or spoiling whatever it’s drawn previously.

The invention was created in collaboration with Swiss engineering school ETH Zürich.

The design team plans to develop the robot so that it can create a variety of textures and erase previous markings.

In the demo video, the robot created pictures of the Lion King, Nemo and Mickey Mouse.
