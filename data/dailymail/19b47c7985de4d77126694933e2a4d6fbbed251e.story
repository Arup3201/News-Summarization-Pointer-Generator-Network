Barcelona have confirmed that new £15million signing Thomas Vermaelen is still carrying a hamstring injury and will have to wait before he starts training with his new team.

The 28-year-old was presented at the Nou Camp on Sunday after completing his move from Arsenal to the Catalan side and admitted he was not yet 100 per cent fit after getting injured during Belgium's 1-0 win over Russia in the World Cup, which meant the defender played just 29 minutes of football in Brazil. 

The former Arsenal captain added he hoped to 'start from zero' after missing most of last season with the Gunners due to a series of injuries but joins Barca as an injured player.

A statement from Barcelona said: 'Thomas Vermaelen injured his right hamstring during the World Cup in June. The player will undergo physiotherapy, and the evolution of the injury will determine when he returns to training.'

Meanwhile, Vermaelen has used his Instagram account to thank the Arsenal fans for their support after leaving the club.

'After 5 years at Arsenal - and the last 2 years a proud captain too - it's time for me to move on.' he wrote.

'The club, the team, the fans, the manager, the staff and other employees, you all made me feel at home at both the training ground and the Emirates Stadium.

'It was a wonderful time and I feel blessed I've had the opportunity to be a part of such a great club. There have been so many wonderful games and experiences, with lifting the FA Cup as an absolute highlight.

'I would like to thank you all for your support, it was a huge honour to be a Gunner!'
