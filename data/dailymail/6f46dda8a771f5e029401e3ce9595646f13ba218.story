A victim of the VIP paedophile abuse scandal claims he saw a Conservative MP murder a young boy at one of their sick orgies.

Detectives are investigating three murders linked to the child sex ring, it was reported last night, days after the Metropolitan Police revealed they had launched a probe into a killing connected to the historical abuse.

A victim of the sickening sex parties says he was in the same room as a boy, aged 12, was strangled by a Tory MP.

The boy, known as Nick, told the Sunday People: 'I watched while that happened. I am not sure how I got out of that. Whether I will ever know why I survived, I am not sure.' 

Now a grown man, he has also told detectives that he saw a 10 or 11-year-old deliberately run over by a car.

As well as this, Nick claims he saw two unknown men murder a third boy in front of another MP 18 months later.

Nick said that he and another abuse victim were taken in a chauffeur-driven car to a luxury townhouse in central London 'to be sexually abused by powerful men'.

Still traumatised by the harrowing events, he gave a graphic description to police of what took place inside the building.

He said: 'The MP was particularly nasty, even among the group of people who sexually abused me and others. I still find it difficult to talk about these incidents after all these years.'

Nick also told detectives about the death of another boy during a sexual assault in front of a Conservative minister - different to the one involved in the first killing.

Nick says his father handed him over to the VIP abusers at Dolphin Square in Pimlico, near the Houses of Parliament, as well as other London locations.

Dolphin Square was last week named as one of the locations where abuse was carried out by powerful individuals.

He says he was raped over and over again by the minister, who also sexually assaulted other boys who were younger than 14 years old. 

His claims are being investigated by police under Operation Midland, part of Operation Fairbank - the large scale investigation into allegations of abuse by high-placed public figures. 

A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: 'Detectives from the child abuse investigation command are working closely with colleagues from homicide and major crime ­concerning this information.'
