Showing no signs of slowing down, David Attenborough, has teamed up with Tourism Australia to make a three-part documentary aimed at drawing tourists to the Great Barrier Reef. 

Nearly 60 years after the wildlife presenter's first visit to the continent, the collaboration was announced at the Destination Australia Conference in Sydney, this week.

'The most exciting natural history experience of my life was the first time I dived on a coral reef [in 1957]. Being on the Reef is a revelatory, thrilling and unbeatable experience and with this project we're going to be able to share it with millions,' Attenborough said.

The popular naturalist spent three weeks filming on and around the Reef and  aboard one of the world's most advanced research vessels equipped with the latest  technology.

Tourism Australia Managing Director, John O'Sullivan said: 'It's wonderful to welcome David back to the Reef where he will, once again, bring to life the many amazing stories of this magnificent natural wonder in his own unique and inimitable way.

'David Attenborough is one of the world's greatest presenters of natural history content, and the Great Barrier Reef is arguably the world's most recognised natural wonder. We couldn't ask for a better match.'

The Great Barrier Reef already attracts more than 1.9 million visitors each year, and 90 per cent of the economic contribution in the region is derived from tourism.

'We already know from our consumer research that Australia's biggest competitive strength is its world class nature, something which is extremely highly regarded from all our key target markets and very much a core part of our global tourism offering,' Mr O'Sullivan continued.

The research also revealed that aquatic and coastal experiences were amongst the most popular tourist activities, specifically to Australia where the Great Barrier Reef ranked highly in appeal amongst international visitors.

'The Great Barrier Reef is a huge part of our destination appeal, with consumers in the UK, US, Singapore and Japan actually ranking it as their number one most appealing Australian attraction.

'It's vital that we continue to show the world why our aquatic and coastal experience are so unique, and this film will undoubtedly help tell that story to a truly global audience in an authentic and engaging way,' Mr O'Sullivan said.

The Reef is at risk of becoming severely damaged due to the dumping of dredge waste in the World Heritage-listed waters, a report commissioned by conservation group WWF said last month.

In January, the Australian government ordered a ban on dumping dredge spoil in the marine park as part of a push to stop the United Nations declaring the site in danger.

Conservationists say dumping waste in reef waters damages it by smothering corals and sea grasses and exposing them to poisons and high levels of nutrients.

The report said port expansions within reef waters, which it noted could see 1.8 billion cubic feet of the ocean floor dug up, would have 'devastating impacts' on the natural wonder.

The report prepared by the consultancy Dalberg Global Development Advisors said there was no need for coal port expansions along Queensland state's coast -where the reef is located - as the capacity at existing terminals was unused one-third of the time.

'These coal port expansions could increase the total coal port capacity of the region from 267 to 637 million tonnes per year', the report added.

Australian authorities are very protective over the Reef. Last year,  Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, sent US President Barack Obama the 'facts' after he expressed fears it would not be there for future generations.

Obama voiced his worries that climate change threatened the natural wonder in a speech during the G20 summit in Brisbane.

But Bishop said there was 'an issue' with his position and that he may have have overlooked Australia's commitment to preserving the coral structure which teems with marine life.

She said the federal and state governments spent Aus$180 million (£105 million) a year preserving the reef.

'Australia knows better than anyone the importance of preserving the Great Barrier Reef,' the minister told Sky News.
