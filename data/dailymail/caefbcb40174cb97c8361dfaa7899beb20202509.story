The abandoned summer resorts of Upstate New York's Sullivan and Ulster counties are a ghostly, eerie and bizarrely beautiful reminder of the halcyon days of the holiday playground known as the Borscht Belt.

Popular with the middle class Jewish community, hence the nickname, and within easy driving distance from New York City, they were the height of glamour and recreation for families heading to the Catskills.

Those unfamiliar with the area need look no further than the film Dirty Dancing, for which it's the setting, or better still this series of stunning images.

Many of the area's finest hotels, that were at the peak of their pomp in the 1960s, have simply been left to rot these days yet maintain much of their majesty in these pictures.

Now with many of them abandoned, photographers have flocked to document them as they evolve
