A millionaire fed up with being abused for driving a 2012 Lamborghini has released a video revealing just what it's like to be behind the wheel of the world's most revered sports car.

Allen Wong, a millionaire originally from New York City, was inspired by a video in which a woman was filmed walking through the city as she was relentlessly cat called and approached by men.

So Mr Wong decided to use the cameras he had installed in his car to show both the good and the bad  reactions he receives while driving a £260,000 ($410,000) sports car. 

Mr Wong recorded the video to show people's reactions when he drives his 2012 Lamborghini Aventador (pictured) through New York

While driving through New York in his blue 2012 Lamborghini Aventador the video shows people  pawing at his car, complementing him, or insulting him.

For better or worse, the video makes it clear that the car turns heads.

Mr Wong said: 'I've had issues before where complete strangers would throw coins at my car simply for having an expensive car.

'I figured that having cameras would deter them and I would have protection against insurance scammers.

'The worst encounter I had was when three young adult males were sitting on the hood of my Lamborghini Gallardo at a parking lot and were catcalling the girls that were walking by. The hood couldn't support all of their weight, so it bent inwards as they were sitting on it.

'There were several occasions when a key in the back pocket or a metal button on (strangers') pants would leave a deep scratch on the car after sitting on it.

'I've caught more than a dozen people sitting on my cars and I don't know how many there are that I didn't catch sitting on the car. Most of the time, they do it to take a picture of themselves.'

A man stares in disbelief as he walks past Mr Wong's Lamborghini. The model he is driving retails at £260,000 ($410,000)

Mr Wong is aged in his 20s and became a millionaire after creating a phone app called 5-0 Radio, a police scanner app.

He said his video began as a 'parody' of the now-infamous NYC cat calling footage, but claims it has a 'very real message telling people to stop damaging other people's property'.

'I just hope that people would stop laying their hands or butts on cars that they do not own. They may not understand that rubbing paint while dirt/dust is on it leaves visible scratch marks and swirls on the car.'
