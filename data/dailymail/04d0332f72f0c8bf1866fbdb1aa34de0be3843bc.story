Swoop: The son of jailed mob boss Vincent 'Vinny Gorgeous' Basciano (pictured)  is among 25 people arrested for allegedly running a $50million betting ring

The son of jailed mafia boss Vincent 'Vinny Gorgeous' Basciano has been arrested on charges of helping to run a $50million betting ring that operated across five states from New York to California.

Vincent Basciano Jr, was among 25 people charged in connection with what police described as a mob-linked enterprise.

They included Gadoon 'Spanky' Kyrollos, and the three owners of gambling website Pinnacle Sports - which boasts of having customers in 100 countries.

Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said: 'Illegal gambling is not a victimless crime.

'Those who participate in these criminal enterprises often use threats, intimidation and even physical force to collect debts.'

Pinnacle sports owners Brandt England, of Las Vegas, George Molsbarger, of Santa Monica, Calif., and Stanley Tomchin, of Montecito, Calif., were charged with enterprise corruption, money laundering and conspiracy.

England faced an additional charge of promoting gambling.

His lawyer in Las Vegas, David Chesnoff, said: 'We certainly intend to defend this matter vigorously in court.'

He declined to address the specifics of the allegations, saying he was new to the case.

The probe was led by investigators from the New York Police Department, but multiple state, municipal and federal law enforcement agencies were involved, and arrests took place in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada and California.

Fifteen of those charged are accused of being bookmakers who took bets on football, baseball and basketball games as well as horse-racing.

According to Inspector Brian O'Neill 
of the NYPD's Organize Crime division members of the group made threats 
to collect money although no charges of violence have been made.

The group allegedly used off-shore gambling web-sites  in an attempt to avoid detection.

The Queens district attorney’s office, which is prosecuting the case, said that in one 18-month period the gambling operation took in $50 million in profit while using computer servers in gambling friendly countries to try to hide dealings with bettors in the U.S.

Gamblers placed bets over the phone and 
at least four websites, while the ring used dummy accounts to hide the 
flow of money and couriers to transport cash profits to and from Panama 
and Costa Rica, authorities said.

Among the others arrested were the three owners of the Pinnacle Sports gambling website

Pinnacle Sports sidestepped the issues of whether it was involved in illegal gambling in the U.S. and whether England, Molsbarger and Tomchin were owners of the site.

'Regarding the recent allegations surrounding the individuals allegedly affiliated with Pinnacle Sports, please be reassured that no Pinnacle Sports employees have been arrested or charged, and Pinnacle Sports itself was not charged in the indictment,' it said in an emailed statement.

'We expect no interruptions to our day to day business activities at this time.'

No one returned a phone message left at a number listed in Tomchin’s name Thursday. Molsbarger’s phone number isn’t publicly listed.

Other people indicted in the case include a manager of the legal sports betting operation at the M Resort Spa Casino in Nevada and men in several states who prosecutors said had worked as bookmakers or money handlers.

Vincent 'Vinny Gorgeous' Basciano earned his name as the owner of Bronx beauty salon 'Hello Gorgeous' as well as for his snappy dress sense and good looks.

He is currently serving life imprisonment having narrowly avoided the death sentence for ordering a 2004 gangland hit on Ralph 'Randy' Pizzolo shortly after taking control of the Bonnanno crime family.

During the trial, prosecutors used the unprecedented testimony of former Bonanno boss Joseph Massino to try to portray Basciano as a stone-cold killer who deserved death.

Massino, 68, broke his family's sacred vow of silence and began talking with investigators after his 2004 conviction for orchestrating a quarter-century's worth of murder, racketeering and other crimes as he rose through the ranks of the Bonannos.

While imprisoned together in 2005, the former Bonanno boss agreed to wear a wire and betray the 51-year-old Basciano by recording conversations about killings and other banter.

Jurors heard one recording of Basciano boasting, 'I'm a hoodlum. I'm a tough guy. Whatever happens happens. Let's go.'

In another, a Massino mused about the demise of the family. 'We was OK until I got pinched,' he said. 'We was on top of the world.'

The classic Mafia movie Donnie Brasco took its inspiration from the reign of terror imposed by the Bonanno crime family.

The New York criminal empire was named after Joseph Bonanno and was the first family to be expelled from The Commission for actively dealing in heroin.

The Commission is the council of the crime bosses brought together to maintain order in the Mafia.Bonanno boss Joseph 'Big Joe'.

Massino was boss from early 1990s to 2004 - he then became the first official boss from New York to become an informant.

Donnie Brasco is the story of how an FBI agent was able to work undercover with the Bonanno crime family and almost became a 'made' man.

The family became the top New York crime family but recently defections have left it less powerful.
