Two of the young men who gang raped a high school girl at a homecoming dance have been sentenced to spend decades behind bars.

An advocate for the victim, who has not been identified throughout the case, read a statement on her behalf as she chose not to be in the courtroom when two of her attackers- Jose Montano and Marcelles Peter- were sentenced on Thursday.

'You both took a lot from me, more than you will ever know, but I just want to say to the both of you, I forgive you,' Jane Doe wrote in the statement read in court.

'I forgive you because I deserve to be at peace, but no matter...how hard I try and wish I could, I'll never forget and there are parts of me that will never be healed.'

Sentenced: Jose Montano (left) was sentenced to 33 years to life for his involvement in the gang rape while Marcelles Peter (right), who was a minor at the time of the attack, faces 29 years

Facing her attackers: While 'Jane Doe' was not in court for the sentencing, she did testify against them during the lengthy trial (pictured in the courtroom sketch)

Jane Doe, who is now 20 years old, wrote that even though the attack happened four years ago, she is still 'struggling and fighting' to get her high school diploma.

During her testimony, the victim said she still has shoulder and hip problems from 
the attack. She also said she now suffers from migraines regularly and 
has trouble learning.

Her mother added that the girl still faces an uncertain future.

'My baby girl, who once wanted to go into law enforcement, has to choose a different career because of the trauma to her body and mind,' she wrote.

The judge presiding over the case, which included six weeks of witness testimony, had a few choice words of her own to add.

Justice: Jose Montano, 20, now faces 33 years to life behind bars to beating and raping the then 16-year-old girl

Changed story: Peter originally denied ever being at the scene of the crime, but later owned up to playing a 'small role'

'The only kindness she was shown that night was she was beaten so badly that she doesn't remember what happened to her,' said Contra Costa County Judge Barbara Zuniga.

'It's beyond shocking that a human being can be dehumanized to the extent that Jane Doe was that night,' she said according to the Contra Costa Times.

'She stopped being a human being to you. She became a thing for you to torture and play with.'

The victim was a sophomore in high school at the time of the attack. Authorities said the girl was beaten, robbed and sexually abused by numerous men over two hours while as many as 20 people watched.

Police discovered her heavily intoxicated, partially nude and unconscious under a picnic table.

Brutalized: Known only as Jane Doe, the 16-year-old was found comatose with near-fatal alcohol levels and head injuries beneath a picnic table outside this Richmond, California high school following a 2009 school dance

Jailed: Ari Morales, left, and Manuel Ortega, 
right, agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years 
respectively

Still awaiting trial: John Crane Jr, 43, left, turned 
himself into police after the incident and Elvis Torrentes, right, faces
charges including aiding the act of rape that could land him in prison 
for 26 years

Peter, who is now 20, was sentenced to 29 years behind bars while now-22-year-old Montano was sentenced to 33 years to life.

The difference in the sentences comes from the fact that Peter was a minor at the time of the attack.

'No words can undo what's been done; all I can do is apologize for my actions and wish to move forward from this situation,' Peter said in court.

Montano is not believed to have made any statements in court.

'Both of you asked me to give you a second chance,' the judge said.

'Mr. Peter and Mr. Montano, Jane does not get a second chance. Mr. Peter, I can't ignore what you did and I can't ignore what you did, Mr. Montano. She deserves justice.'

Accused: Elvis Torrentes (right) and John Crane Jr. (center) still await trial for their role in the attack that involved as many as 20 men and boys. Jose Montano walks behind them to their preliminary hearing in June

Aside from Montano and Peter, two defendants had already taken plea deals in the case. Ari Morales was sentenced to 27 years in prison, Manuel Ortega to 30 years.

The final two defendants, John Crane and Elvis Torrentes, were awaiting trial on lesser sexual assault charges.

The victim received $4 million to settle a lawsuit against the West Contra Costa Unified School District in 2010.
