They are the stateless nomads of a disputed desert, abandoned by the world and left to fend for themselves.

The Turkana people are itinerant herders who have lived off the land in the Ilemi Triangle, in East Africa, for centuries.

But for the last hundred years their cultural heartland has been under continual threat as surrounding countries squabble over the region.

South Sudan and Kenya both lay claim to the land, which also borders Ethiopia to the west, in a dispute that arose from unclear wording of a 1914 treaty which tried to allow free movement of the Turkana people.

Herders: The Turkana people are itinerant herders who have lived off the land in the Ilemi Triangle, East Africa, for hundreds of years. They must guard their livestock with their lives as bandits and cattle rustlers are a constant threat

Proud people: A Turkana woman stands in Napak village in northwestern Kenya inside the Turkana region of the Ilemy Triangle

Happy together: They are the stateless nomads of a disputed desert, abandoned by the world and left to fend for themselves

Disputed region: South Sudan and Kenya both lay claim to the land, which also borders Ethiopia to the west

Squabbles: The dispute that arose from unclear wording of a 1914 treaty which tried to allow free movement of the Turkana people

High rank: The Turkana people have elaborate clothing, using dress to distinguish between age groups, development stages, occasions and rank

Livestock is an important aspect of Turkana culture and includes the use of goats, camels, donkeys and zebu as the primary herd stock

Livestock functions not only as a source of milk and meat, but also as form of currency used for bride-price negotiations and dowries

Livestock functions not only as a milk and meat producer, but as form of currency used for bride-price negotiations and dowries

Home: Houses are made over a wooden structure of domed saplings on which fronds of the Doum Palm tree Hyphaene thebaica, hides or skins, are thatched on

Often, a young man will be given a single goat with which to start a herd, and will accumulate more through animal husbandry. In turn, once he has accumulated enough livestock, he will use these animals to negotiate for wives

Tough life: Turkana women and children sit by a hut in Napak village in northwestern Kenya

Inside: The houses tend to be big enough to house a family of six, while during the wet season they are elongated to fit more people inside and covered with cowdung

Pastoralists: They do not differentiate between religion and culture. To them the two are intertwined. The Turkana are pastoralists whose lives are shaped by the extreme climate in which they live
