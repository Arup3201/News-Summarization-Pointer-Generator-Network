Rio Ferdinand is to consider withdrawing his support from future FA initiatives in the wake of his three-match ban for using the word ‘sket’ on Twitter — slang for a promiscuous girl or woman.

The QPR defender, 35, is still furious after an FA commission found him guilty of misconduct for abusing another user of the social media platform on September 30.

Some people in football believe Ferdinand is the victim of a witch-hunt.

Ferdinand was a member of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s commission that was set up to safeguard the future of the national game and has previously stated a desire to become England manager one day.

That is all in jeopardy after the FA commission banned him for three games, fined him £25,000 and ordered the former England defender to attend an education programme.

Although Ferdinand accepts that his response on social media to a tweet about his performances in a QPR shirt was inappropriate, other players have escaped FA scrutiny.

Five days ago his Rangers team-mate Joey Barton accused Barcelona forward Neymar of being ‘Messi’s fluffer’ on Twitter.

A ‘fluffer’ is a slang term used in the adult entertainment industry, but the FA’s disciplinary team have yet to call the midfielder to account.

Ferdinand is active on social media, with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page and over 14,500 tweets

Barton also claimed that Oscar Pistorius ‘definitely intended to kill her (Reeva Steenkamp)’ in yet another outburst that has escaped FA punishment.

Ferdinand, who is scheduled to miss QPR’s games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle, is still considering whether to appeal against the verdict.

His manager Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand’s ban, which was at the same level as a red card for a two-footed tackle.

Redknapp said: ‘The same as a two-footed challenge? No. If someone slags him off and he goes back and slags them off. It doesn’t equate. I genuinely don’t know what goes on on Twitter. It would save all the hassle if no-one was on Twitter.’
