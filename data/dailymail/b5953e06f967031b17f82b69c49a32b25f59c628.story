A historic hilltop town in Sicily has put 20 empty properties on the market for just one euro each in a bid to attract new investment to the area.

Local authorities in Gangi are offering the properties for just 80p as many lie derelict after being bequeathed to locals who cannot afford to renovate them.

The only catch is that buyers have to pay a €5,000 (£3,970) guarantee to ensure that they will refurbish the homes, with some estimated at needing around €35,000 (£28,000) worth of improvements.

They will also have to pay the €6,000 (£4,760) legal costs associated with purchasing the property.

The initiative to encourage people to buy the homes was launched a few years ago, but is now starting to receive interest thanks to English speaking property consultant Marie Webster.

Ms Webster who lives in Sicily is now marketing the homes to foreigners.

She told the Local: 'They want foreigners to come in and take over the properties, because there isn’t much work around here so people are moving away. It’s a beautiful project.

Many of the homes up for sale in Gangi lie derelict and it is estimated 35,000 euros worth of repairs would be needed on each one

'You need to have someone to fix the roof, the floors, the sewage and water. These more difficult things would cost around €35,000, then the rest you can do yourself and have a house that’s completely like new.'

It is thought that there has been interest in the properties from British, Swedish and American buyers with some of the homes already being snapped up by an Italian businessman.

The town of Gangi is described as being in central Sicily set amongst wooded valleys and wheat fields with Mount Etna as its backdrop.

The initiative is similar to a plan launched in nearby Salemi, where houses overlooking the Mediterranean were also put up for sale for one euro.

Many of the properties there were barely standing, and in dire need of renovation, following a destructive earthquake in 1968.

Owners were to be given two years to restore the house in keeping with its original character.
