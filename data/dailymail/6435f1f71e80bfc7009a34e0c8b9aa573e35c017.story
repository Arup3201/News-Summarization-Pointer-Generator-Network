Universities should be free to charge what they like for degree courses as long as they offer help to poorer students, a vice-chancellor has said.

Sir Howard Newby, vice-chancellor of Liverpool University, said that the 'most rational' way to fund higher education in the future would be to lift the current £9,000 cap and replace it with a 'sliding scale' of fees.

In an interview with the Times Higher Education (THE) magazine, Sir Howard said he thought that the current fee system is unlikely to change for at least three years.

Under major higher education reforms, fees for English universities were tripled to a maximum of £9,000 in 2012.

Sir Howard said: 'Nothing is going to happen this side of an election, so what we have at the moment we are stuck with probably until at least 2017, and that includes the £9,000 fee cap.'

He added: 'The most rational way to deal with the financing of higher education is to have fees which are uncontrolled, with no cap, but in return (universities) have to make adequate provision for looking after students who can't afford to pay that fee.'

This system would mean 'a sliding scale where the higher the fee, the more money is devoted to meeting the cost of higher education', Sir Howard told the THE, adding it would be in line with recommendations made in the Browne Review of higher education funding in 2010.

His comments come just months after a report warned that universities will need more money in the future if they are to cope with increasing numbers of students.

The study, by vice-chancellors' group Universities UK, argued that the tuition fee hike has not given many universities extra cash with the income largely replacing cuts to government funding.

It suggested that institutions will need funds to invest in areas such as buildings and facilities if they are to offer students a decent university experience and keep up with other countries.

The report followed suggestions by a number of higher education leaders that tuition fees will need to rise in the coming years to allow universities to meet their costs.

Universities UK president and Surrey University vice-chancellor Sir Christopher Snowden has said that there was a case for raising the £9,000 fee cap in line with inflation.

In an interview he said that fees 'can't remain frozen forever' and that in real terms, by 2016, on current inflation rates the maximum fee will be worth about £8,250.

And Oxford vice-chancellor Professor Andrew Hamilton has argued that a university's charges should be linked to what it offers, saying that the cost of an Oxford education totals more than £16,000 per undergraduate each year.
