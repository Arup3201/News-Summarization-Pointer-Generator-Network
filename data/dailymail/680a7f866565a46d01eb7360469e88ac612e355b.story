They're known as the wisest animals in the kingdom, with their nocturnal hoots heard far and wide. 

But for one breed of owl, quick-wits are just as important when lamenting one's place in the wild. 

Tucked away in the creek of a tree, the Eastern screen owl can hardly be seen from a distance, its spotted feathers blending in perfectly to the wood and bark encasing it. 

The owl's camouflaging techniques have evolved over time in order to protect its home and catch prey, with adults standing guard as tiny owlets hide behind them.

In a stunning set of images captured by British photographer Graham McGeorge, one litter of young huddle together as their parents hunt for prey.

The 43-year-old from Dumfries watched the family from 20-feet away on a trip to Florida, after journeying to the U.S. to catch a glimpse of the elusive birds. 

One of the images, titled Master of Disguise: The Next Generation, was listed in 2013 for a National Geographic photography competition. 

Though famed for its mastery of the art of camouflage, the screech owl is known for its low-pitched hoots and howls which give it its name.

Hiding in plain sight: The owl's scrunched face of feathers and beak are hardly visible at close range, making it near impossible for preying animals to pick them out of the wild

Now you see me, now you don't: Though famed by its mastery of camouflage, the screech owl is also known for its low-pitched hoots and rasps which give it its name
