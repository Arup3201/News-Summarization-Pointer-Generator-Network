An award winning 'small house' built above a garage in a back lane of Sydney's Surry Hills sold for $1.88 million last night, nine days before its planned auction.

The five-story home, which has been called the 'house of millimetres' in the design world, was constructed in 2010 on a 44-square metre car park on a street corner just three car spaces wide.

Designer and previous owner Domenic Alvaro said the sale was 'the end of an amazing journey' for he and his wife, who have decided to move to a bigger home after having their second child.  

'The project has a lot of love and a lot of passion in it and I hope the buyer will feel that,' Mr Alvaro told the Daily Mail Australia. 'It's just a gem of a house in the best part of town.'

At almost $43,000 per square metre, it is also one of Sydney's most expensive.

Selling agent Ivan Bresic said the price was a record for a one-bedroom property in Surry Hills and that this was due to its designer build. A close comparison, he told the Daily Mail Australia, was a similar 100 square metre one-bedroom property in Printers Lane in Sydney's Darlinghurst which went for a recent $1.1 million. But according to property expert Ross Elliott of the Residential Development Council, 'there's really not many Big Small sales like this anywhere else in Australia.' 

The compact design, which won Alvaro a string of architecture awards, including the World Architecture Festival's World House of the Year in 2011, was inspired by architects in Tokyo and other parts of the world who work with small spaces using prefabricated concrete that can be assembled on site in a matter of days.

Alvaro said he was on the lookout for a challenging inner-city space to work with when he came across the car park in Belmore Lane. He bought the site back in 2008 for $230,000.

'I definitely wanted to dabble in developing unconventional land because that's where my skills are; in taking blank sites and transforming them into beautiful, liveable homes,' said Alvaro, a Principle at Architecture Firm Woods Baggot. 

The one-bedroom Small House covers 200 square metres over five floors and includes  a rooftop terrace, two bathrooms and a garage. It has living areas on  three levels and enjoys panoramic city views from the top floor and luxury interior features like a marble kitchen and basalt stone floors.

Alvaro said the small house philosophy is to build upwards rather than outwards and to create spaces which are flexible enough to be used in different ways.

The use of commercial prefabricated concrete in tight  residential sites was something relatively new in Australia when the house was built in 2010. 

'It enabled a really solid construction that we were actually able to  put together in just four days', said Alvaro, even though he spent about eight months on the actual designs.

'It takes a lot of effort and conviction to design, plan and deliver something so unconventional like this; we really pushed the boundaries,' he said. 'I now look back and go "bloody hell, did I really do this?"' 

The Small House has also featured on Grand Designs Australia and has won a number of  local awards including Residential Architecture (Houses) and Small Project Architecture at the NSW Australian Institute of Architects Awards; and New House under 200 square metres at the annual Houses Awards.

What's next for the award-winning architect? 

Alvaro recently completed a cottage for a friend in New Zealand and says he has plans for a row house for his family in Sydney's Inner West.

'Professionally, I'm focusing on small apartments, mostly in Sydney,' he said, adding 'I can't share too much as  plans are still a bit under wraps.'

'But It's a really exciting time to be working in this space,' he said. 'New legislation is now permitting a smaller apartment market. We've been saying for a while now: "Look, a one-bedroom or studio apartment can actually be much smaller if it's designed well; they can have a level of luxury and joinery and quality finish but in a small offer that is more affordable and practical for inner city living.'
