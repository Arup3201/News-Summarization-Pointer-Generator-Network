Andrew Flintoff dragged himself out of his fish and chip van and came agonisingly close to inspiring Lancashire to Twenty20 final glory as Warwickshire claimed their first-ever Twenty20 crown.

The 36-year-old former England all-rounder got a last-minute call up for the final after Kabir Ali damaged his shoulder in the semi and looked set to deliver a virtuoso performance when he dismissed his old mate Ian Bell with the first ball of his spell.

He returned, with hope apparently gone, to smash 20 not out off just eight balls, to give Lancashire a chance of the most unlikely victory only for current England all-rounder Chris Woakes to hold his nerve with a brilliant last over to leave Flintoff and his team-mates five runs short of victory.

Flintoff, who retired from cricket in 2009 with a chronic knee condition, struck with the first ball of his spell before Laurie Evans smashed 53 from 30 balls to set Lancashire a tough 182 winning target.

The 2005 Ashes winning legend has spent the past three weeks filming a documentary on fish and chips for Sky One but he looked in good nick out on the field even if Lancashire captain Varun Chopra preferred England’s current pace ace Jimmy Anderson.

‘It happened so quickly,’ said Flintoff, who finished with two for 20 off two overs in his third game back after coming out of retirement earlier this season. ‘I was just told to get yourself ready to play.

‘I’d be lying to say I wasn’t nervous but I wasn’t too bad. I thought Belly had hit it better than he had. The celebration was out of surprise as much as anything. I also bowled the worst ball I’ve ever bowled in my career, a waist-high full-toss which went for six.

‘As soon as you start to get ahead yourself the game catches up with you.’

Warwickshire, who had never previously reached a T20 final, shrugged off the euphoria surrounding Flintoff’s appearance in the final to post a challenging total of 181-5 after Bell had chipped his first ball to Karl Evans to take a smart catch and spark delirious celebrations.

Evans was the star of the show for the home side, smashing 53 from just 30 balls including four huge sixes and two fours to seemingly take the game away from Lancashire under the lights in front of a packed Edgbaston crowd.

He was ably supported by Chopra (30 off 17 balls) and William Porterfield (31 from 23) as Anderson in particular came in for some heavy punishment to finish with none for 52 from four overs.

Tom Smith and Ashwell Prince added 41 for the first wicket but Lancashire were always behind the rate and when Jos Buttler was out the writing looked on the wall before Karl Brown gave them hope with some superb hitting.

Brown smashed 55 off 28 before Chris Woakes bowled him, bringing Flintoff to the crease with 30 required off 13 balls. Surely not?

Flintoff hit his first ball for one before smashing two towering sixes in successive balls off Oliver Hannon-Dolby’ to leave his side needing 14 off the last over from Chris Woakes’ last over and leave his many fans in the crowd dreaming of yet another fairytale chapter in his incredible career.

A scampered single got Flintoff on strike and successive twos left his side needing nine off three balls. But Woakes kept his discipline and restricted Flintoff to a single and Stephen Parry was unable to hit six off the last ball. Agony for Lancashire, joy for Warwickshire.

Earlier Warwickshire beat Surrey by 16 runs in the first semi-final by 16 runs while Lancashire beat Hampshire by 14 runs to reach the final.
