Rangers rounded off a good week's work with a comfortable 4-1 win over Dumbarton - taking their tally of goals to 12 in the process.

First-half goals from Lee McCulloch and Darren McGregor set Rangers up for another home win on the back of Monday's 8-1 hammering of Clyde.

And although it was a gutsy performance from Dumbarton, a second-half strike from Nicky Clark and an own goal from Chris Turner left Ian Murray's side on the wrong of another crushing defeat - with only a Bilel Mohsni own goal for consolation.

Dumbarton made a confident start and provided an early threat on the home goal. After three minutes Stevie Simonsen, in his first league start, made the first save of the game getting down to smother an effort from Colin Nish.

Rangers first chance to test the visitors' goalkeeper arrived after 10 minutes from a free-kick on the right of the penalty area. But with plenty of height in the box, Lewis MacLeod elected to play a low ball which was easily cleared by the Sons' defence.

Four minutes later MacLeod made amends when his perfect delivery from a corner was met on the volley by McCulloch and from six yards the ball flew high past Danny Rogers to make it 1-0.

Rangers came within inches of doubling their lead two minutes later but MacLeod watched his 30-yard drive rebound from the foot of the post.

After 20 minutes the other post was rattled. McGregor's long throw was nodded back by Kris Boyd, allowing Clark to swivel before slamming his shot off the upright with the goalkeeper well beaten.

Nine minutes later, though, the Dumbarton goalkeeper was beaten again when McGregor raced into the box on the right before unleashing a powerful angled drive high into the net.

Having been largely idle since the opening spell, seven minutes from the break Simonsen was forced into a fine save diving low to his left to push away an angled drive from Nish.

A minute later the Rangers goalkeeper made another good stop, blocking Turner's downward header - although he was in an offside position.

The first-half ended with Rogers the busier goalkeeper, producing a couple of saves from Nicky Law and Lee Wallace.

Three minutes after the break a brilliant piece of skill from Law set-up a half-volley towards to top corner but Rogers matched it with a superb one-handed save.

The goalkeeper had no chance in the 53rd minute when Rangers made it 3-0. Boyd broke into the box and then unselfishly rolled the ball in front of Clark who had the simple task of sliding the ball home from 10 yards.

MacLeod, having made a significant contribution, was then replaced along with David Templeton as Arnold Peralta and Dean Shiels came on.

And within two minutes Shiels made his own contribution, whipping in a corner which was missed by the goalkeeper leaving the ball to rebound off Turner's face and into his own net.

Injury was added to insult and while the Sons defender was off the pitch receiving treatment, Rangers had the ball in the net again but Boyd's header was ruled out for offside.

Dumbarton finally got their consolation goal 10 minutes from time when Bilel Mohsni headed Gilhaney's curling cross beyond his own goalkeeper.

Despite losing four goals, Rogers capped a fine afternoon with another impressive save to deny Clark a fifth for Rangers.
