She has suffered the trauma of one miscarriage and one stillbirth.

Now Amanda Holden has sworn never to try for more children because she doesn’t want to ‘put my family through that again.’

The Britain’s Got Talent presenter, 43, has two daughters - Lexi, eight, and Hollie, two, - with her husband Chris Hughes.

I'm done: Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden has told how she came close to death during the birth of her youngest child

But before her second birth she suffered years of heartbreak, having a miscarriage in 2010 and a stillborn son the following year.

She said she ‘came close to death’ when Hollie was born in 2012 after suffering a huge loss of blood and spending three days in intensive care.

Miss Holden told Essentials magazine: ‘If I could, I would have more kids, but I can’t put my family through that again. Chris and I were talking about this the other day, saying how if we’d met earlier we’d have had more kids, but that you end up with the ones you’re meant to have. We’re incredibly lucky to have our girls.’

Miss Holden said that before she became a Britain’s Got Talent judge and worked in West End stage musicals she struggles to combine the demands of motherhood with her career.

She said: ‘Acting is pretty gruelling. You’re away for weeks, sometimes months, on end… it’s hard to balance with kids.’

She added: ‘BGT gave me the financial freedom not to have to worry about working all the time – and I could do it around my kids.’

From September, Miss Holden will stand in for This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby while she is away on maternity leave.

She said the breakfast show will fit perfectly around her family routine, adding: ‘I’ll be back to pick Lexi up from school, and Hollie’s at nursery a few days a week.’

Talking about her husband, who works as a record producer, she said: : ‘He says he’s last on the family list after the hamster. It’s not true. I love that man. I couldn’t do any of this without him because he’s my core.

‘We try for date nights, we really do, but usually we’re so tired we end up lying in front of a box set in our PJs. Actually, that’s pretty much my idea of bliss.’

Speaking about the pain of her stillbirth Miss Holden said last year: ‘From somewhere in the hospital, I could hear the most horrendous screams. I presumed it was from the labour ward until I realised I could hear my daughter’s name, "Lexi, Lexi, Lexi!" being shouted out animalistically.

‘It was me wailing and making the most horrific guttural noises. Everything came tumbling down.’
