Ex News of the World news editor Ian Edmondson, 45, pictured at the Old Bailey today, admitted one charge of conspiring to intercept voicemails

A former News of the World news editor has been warned he may face jail after admitting plotting to hack phones in the pursuit of stories.

Ian Edmondson, 45, was dropped as a defendant in the original hacking trial of ex-editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks in December last year after the trial judge discharged him on health grounds.

But today Edmondson, of Raynes Park, south west London, admitted conspiring with colleagues and private detective Glenn Mulcaire to intercept the private voicemails of a host of celebrities, politicians, sports stars and royals between October 3 2000 and August 9, 2006.

He admitted one charge of conspiring to intercept voicemails and will be charged next month, Mr Justice Saunders said. 

The judge remanded Edmondson on bail but warned him: 'not to read anything into that'. 

Among those targeted by the tabloid executive were senior government ministers John Prescott, Charles Clarke and David Blunkett, Hollywood stars Sienna Miller and Jude Law, and Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney.

During the original eight-month trial, jurors were told how Edmondson had worked as an executive on the newsdesk - the 'engine room of the newsroom' - since 2005.

He was suspended in 2010 after three emails emerged implicating him in the hacking conspiracy, and he was sacked a year later when police saw emails sent between Edmondson and Mulcaire including clear instructions on hacking the phones of Tessa Jowell, Lord Freddie Windsor, and John Prescott's advisor, Joan Hammell.

After he joined the now defunct News of the World, Edmondson had been keen to terminate Mulcaire's £100,000 a year contract, but in 2005 he signed off its renewal once he realised its value, the court heard.

In all, he was responsible for nearly a quarter of the newsdesk orders to Mulcaire, according to an analysis of detailed notes kept by the private eye. 

Police found more than 8,000 tasking notes at Mulcaire's home, many of which did not identify who had instructed him. However, 334 of them had 'an" written in the top left-hand corner, identifying Edmondson as the tasker, starting from February 2005.

Former NotW royal editor Clive Goodman told the trial of Coulson and Brooks earlier this year that Edmondson and Coulson openly discussed phone hacking at the paper's daily news conference. 

He said Edmondson had once boasted, during the hunt for Lotto rapist Iorworth Hoare, that 'his man could triangulate position from mobile phone signals.'

'It was fairly obvious to me that he was using mobile phone data to find out things,' he said.

Goodman also told the trial that Edmondson resorted to hacking the phones of his colleagues, so he knew which stories they were working on, and that of his boss, Coulson, each morning.

In 2006, Coulson sent Edmondson an incriminating email ordering him to 'do his phone', in an apparent reference to the celebrity Calum Best.

The court was told that there was a culture of secrecy and competition in the Sunday tabloid newsroom under Coulson.

Defending, Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC said: 'Mr Edmondson was aware of phone hacking that was industry-wide and common knowledge.

'Mulcaire had bragged on many occasions in the past of his ability to hack phones and obtain information through that methodology.'

She told the court that her client was working 'under the direct instruction from senior executives to use Mulcaire'.

But Mr Justice Saunders warned him that he could face jail despite admitting his part in the conspiracy.

Adjourning the sentencing for reports, he remanded the married journalist on conditional bail but repeatedly cautioned him 'not to read anything into that'.

Today, prosecutors announced they would take no further action against News International's former legal chief Tom Crone, who was arrested two years ago over phone-hacking and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, saying there was insufficient evidence to secure a conviction. 

In a statement, his lawyer Henri Brandman said: 'My client, Tom Crone, the former Legal Manager of News International, was arrested two years ago in respect of various allegations including conspiracy to intercept communications and perverting the course of justice.

'He is delighted to have received news today that there will be no further action relating to the allegations. 

'Given the lack of evidence to support those allegations, he is also surprised that it has taken the relevant authorities two years and one month to reach this decision.'

In July, Coulson, 46, was found guilty of the hacking plot while Brooks, 46, and retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 74, were cleared of any wrongdoing.

Other NotW journalists had pleaded guilty to being part of the voicemail interception conspiracy before the trial started.

Reporter Dan Evans, 38, of Kilburn, north London, was handed a 10-month jail term suspended for 12 months plus 200 hours of community service.

News of the World news editor Greg Miskiw, 64, from Leeds, and chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, 52, of Esher, Surrey, were each jailed for six months.

News editor James Weatherup, 58, of Brentwood in Essex, was jailed for four months, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to do 200 hours' unpaid community work.

Mr Justice Saunders described Mulcaire, 44, of Sutton, south London, as 'the lucky one', saying it would be wrong to jail him again after he had already served a sentence in 2006 when he was first convicted of phone hacking with ex-royal editor Clive Goodman.

The judge sentenced Mulcaire to six months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, plus 200 hours unpaid community work.
