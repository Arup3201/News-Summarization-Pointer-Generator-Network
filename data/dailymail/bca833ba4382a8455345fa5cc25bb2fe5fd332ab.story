A teenager was overcome with terror after discovering a python in her bath - which had been slithering around under the floorboards for months.

Trudi Evans, 45, was at work when she got a panicked phone call from her daughter Natasha, 17, who had found a 3ft snake in the bath tub.

The family, from Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, have since discovered the Royal Python belonged to a previous neighbour - who said it had escaped in July.

Hungry: The 3ft Royal Python went missing from a neighbour's home in July and hadn't eaten for months

Panic: Natasha Evans found the 3ft python slithering around the bathtub of her home in Tyne and Wear

Trudi, a garage worker, said: 'I got a phone call from Natasha saying there was a snake in the bath, and of course I didn't believe her, or I thought if anything it was a little grass snake or a worm.

'She sounded really scared so I thought I had no choice but to leave work and go home. I think my boss thought I'd made up some kind of ridiculous lie to get out of work.

'When I got there, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There was a huge snake as long as my arm in the bath.

'Tasha said she had gone in the bathroom and without really looking leant down to put the plug in the bath and saw the snake out of the corner of her eye and ran out of the bathroom.

Snake in the bath:  'If your dog goes missing you put up posters and look for it. They could have at least warned us so we knew to keep an eye out for it,' said Trudi

'She wasn't sure if she'd actually seen it or imagined it, so she opened the door and looked back in and there it was.'

Trudi was even more shocked to discover their former neighbours, who bred snakes, had been missing the snake for months. 

She added: 'The family who used to live next door bred snakes and Tasha went on Facebook to message them and ask if they were missing a snake.

'They said it had been missing since they moved house in July and just thought it was dead so didn't look for it.

'So this snake has been living in the empty house next door since July and must have got under the floorboards and worked its way over to our house. It's terrifying.

'I've got two hamsters, a dwarf rabbit, two cats and a dog - what if it had got hold of them?

'If your dog goes missing you put up posters and look for it. They could have at least warned us so we knew to keep an eye out for it.

'I would have had the house searched top to bottom if I'd known.'

The Royal Python is also known as a Ball python, named after its tendency to curl into a ball when stressed

The snake has now been removed from the house, but Trudi is far from regaining her peace of mind.

She said: 'Tasha put an appeal out on Facebook asking for someone to come and take the snake and a woman got in touch who rescues them.

'She said it was starving and hadn't ate for months. It was dangerous and to think we don't know how long it's been creeping around under the floorboard.

'I haven't been in the bath since and I'm scared to even go into the bathroom.

'I know it is the kind of thing that makes people laugh because it's so unusual, but it could have been really dangerous as well.

'I'm going to be straight on the phone to get someone to come round and pull all the floorboards up to check there aren't any others.

'If that has been living next door since July, who knows what else is there?'

Royal Pythons are also known as Ball pythons and are a non-venomous snake that come from Africa. 

In the wild, their diet consists mostly of small mammals, such as African soft-furred rats, shrews and striped mice. Pets usually eat rats or mice.

Ball pythons are notoriously picky eaters and can go months without food, particularly during the winter breeding season.

Other reasons for not eating include: when the python is preparing to shed, stress caused by overhandling, too high or too low a temperature or humidity.   

They are the smallest of the African pythons and a popular pet.

The name Ball python refers to the reptile's tendency to curl into a ball when it is stressed or frightened.

The name Royal Python, from the Latin name Python Regius, comes from the fact that African rulers would wear the python as jewellery.

Adult Royal Pythons can grow up to 6ft long and have a stocky build, but a relatively small head.

The colour pattern is typically black or dark brown with light brown of gold sides and dorsal blotches.
