A victim of a monster tornado that ravaged Washington, Illinois on Sunday has revealed the heartbreaking moment he watched the storm destroy his 'dream house'.

Speaking with a bandage across his face, Kris Lancaster vowed to rebuild the home - now reduced to rubble - where he and his wife Mandy have raised their children for the past two years.

'It was the home that we worked so hard 
through our lives to get,' he told Good Morning America on Monday. 'To get into a better neighborhood, better 
town, better school district.

'We've only lived here two years and our dream
home has gone.'

Footage he recorded of the terrifying storm shows the massive tornado lumbering through the neighborhood as debris swirls around him. At the last minute, he runs for the basement.

'I was feeling devastated watching it tear 
up the neighborhood as it came to me,' he said.

'I actually thought it was going to 
curve and at the last second it didn't and I took off running... and I watched my whole house just vanish around me.

'I've got debris hitting 
me, the refrigerator knocked me into the other room and finally I jumped to 
the [basement] stairs and my 19-year-old son pulled me down to safety.'

He added that he was feeling sore and in shock.

'I really don't know where to go from here,' he said, adding that anything viewers could send to help him and his neighborhood would be much appreciated. They have set up a fundraising page.

Others are revealing their stories of loss following the dozens of tornadoes and 
intense thunderstorms that swept across the Midwest on Sunday, leaving 
at least eight people dead and unleashing powerful winds that flattened 
entire neighborhoods, flipped over cars and uprooted trees.

On Monday morning, officials confirmed there had been two deaths in Michigan, raising the initial death toll from six to eight.

As a powerful tornado bore down on their farmhouse, Curt Zehr's wife and adult son said they didn't have time to do anything but scramble down the stairs into their basement.

The pair looked out moments later to find the house gone and the sun out 'right on top' of them, Zehr said. Their home, on the outskirts of Washington, Illinois, had been swept up and scattered over hundreds of yards.

'They saw (the tornado) right there and got in the basement,' said a stunned Zehr, pointing to the farm field near the rubble that had been his home.

Early on Monday, Washington Mayor Gary
Manier estimated that from 250 to 500 homes were either damaged or 
destroyed in the storm and that it wasn't clear when residents would be 
allowed to return.

'Everybody's without power, but some people are without everything,' Manier told reporters in the parking lot of a destroyed auto parts store and near a row of flattened homes.

'How people survived is beyond me,' he said.

The unusually powerful late-season wave of thunderstorms brought damaging winds and tornadoes to 12 states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and western New York.

Bill Bunting, forecast operations chief of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said the storms all belonged to the same system and would be 'moving rapidly to the east and continue east overnight and into the morning'.

Illinois was the hardest struck with at least six people killed and dozens more injured.

An elderly man and his sister were killed when a tornado hit their home in the rural southern Illinois community of New Minden, coroner Mark Styninger said.

A third person died in Washington, while three others perished in Massac County in the far southern part of the state, said Patti Thompson of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. She did not provide details.

Communications remained difficult and 
with many roads impassable it was not clear if the injury and death 
tolls would rise on Monday. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn declared seven 
counties disaster areas.

Washington, a town of 16,000 about 140 miles southwest of Chicago, appeared to have suffered the most severe damage. The tornado cut a path about an eighth of a mile wide from one side of town to the other, State Trooper Dustin Pierce said.

Across farm fields a little more than a mile from where Zehr's home was swept up, several blocks of homes were destroyed.

About 75 friends and neighbors helped 
Zehr to salvage his family's belongings. He said he'd been at church 
when the tornado hit but that his wife, Sue, and son were at home.

The Illinois National Guard assisted with search and recovery operations in Washington.

The White House issued a statement saying President Barack Obama had been briefed about the damage and was in touch with federal, state and local officials. Governor Quinn was scheduled to survey affected areas on Monday.

As law enforcement officers continued to search for victims and sized up the cleanup and rebuilding job ahead, they kept everyone but residents and emergency workers out.

With power off and lines down in many areas, natural gas lines leaking and trees and other debris blocking many streets, an overnight curfew kept all but emergency vehicles off pitch-black roads.

The only lights visible across most of Washington on Sunday night were red and blue flashes from police and fire truck lights.

Pierce said there were reports of looting around town.

Across Washington, an auto parts store with several people inside was reduced to a pile of bricks, metal and rebar; a battered car, its windshield impaled by a piece of lumber, was flung alongside it.

'The employees were climbing out of this,' Pierce said, gesturing to the rubble behind him. None of them was seriously injured, he said.

At OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in nearby Peoria, spokeswoman Amy Paul said 37 storm victims had been treated, including eight with injuries ranging from broken bones to head injuries.

Another hospital, Methodist Medical Center in Peoria, treated more than a dozen, but officials there said none of them were seriously injured.

Just how many tornadoes hit was unclear. Although about 80 reports of tornadoes had come in as of Sunday night, the National Weather Service's Bunting said the actual number will likely be in the 30 to 40 range. He said that's because the same tornado often gets reported multiple times.

Weather service meteorologist Matt Friedlein said such weather is rare this late in the year, but that strong winds coupled with temperatures in the 60s and 70s spawned Sunday's storms.
