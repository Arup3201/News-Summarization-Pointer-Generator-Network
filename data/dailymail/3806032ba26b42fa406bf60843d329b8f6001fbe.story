The mother of a photographer who was killed after taking pictures of Justin Bieber's Ferrari in January has claimed that he was hit by two cars - possibly including one from the singer's entourage.

Chris Guerra, 29, was knocked down by a car in Los Angeles on January 1 as he crossed the road after snapping Bieber's $200,000 white 458 Italia Ferrari, unaware the singer was not inside.

But now TMZ has claimed that a second driver, whose vehicle fits the basic description of an SUV in Bieber's entourage, is wanted for felony hit-and-run after striking the photographer afterwards.

Killed: Photographer Chris Guerra, 29, was hit by a car after snapping Justin Bieber's Ferrari in January. His mother now says he was hit by two cars - possibly including one from Bieber's entourage

Law enforcement sources reportedly told the website that they have used surveillance video and forensic evidence to conclude the vehicle was a black Range
Rover or a Hummer

Guerra's
mother, Vickie, added that she thinks it could have belonged to someone from Bieber's entourage who had been following his Ferrari or who was hoping to help its driver, rapper Lil Twist, after he was pulled over.

Bieber was not in the vehicle or in town at the time of the crash, so it is unknown why any of his entourage would have been nearby.

Police have not commented on the claim and said the investigation is ongoing.

Guerra's mother said she wants police to 
show her the surveillance footage of the accident so that she can see 
who struck her son, but they have refused, telling her it's an ongoing 
investigation.

Mowed down: After a police officer told him to return to his car, Guerra crossed the road and was hit by this SUV, driven by a 69-year-old woman who has not faced any charges

Tragic: Guerra's shoe and hat can be seen on the ground after he was struck and killed by a car

MailOnline has contacted a Bieber spokesperson for a comment.

The tragedy unfolded after Lil Twist, who was behind the wheel of the Ferrari, was pulled over on the Freeway for allegedly speeding on the 405.

Guerra, a freelance photographer, was tailing the car at the time after reportedly telling friends earlier that day that he had seen the singer smoking marijuana from a pipe. Bieber has denied this.

Guerra got out of his car to take pictures but after police repeatedly told him to return to his vehicle, he ran across the road to his car - but he was struck by a Toyota Highlander SUV. He died at a hospital shortly after.

Photographs taken from the scene show Guerra's hat and shoe lying in the road where he was hit. His heartbroken family said they found out about his death from television even though they had repeatedly called the LAPD to ask if it was their son who had died.

Not involved: Justin Bieber, left, was not in his Ferrari at the time of the crash and sent his condolences to Guerra's family afterwards. Lil Twist, right, was driving the Ferrari and had been pulled over

The 69-year-old woman who struck the photographer cooperated with authorities. She has not faced any charges.

After Guerra's death, sources close to Bieber claimed that the photographer 'stalked and harassed' the star, 'following and chasing him at every opportunity' and falsely accusing him of smoking pot.

A spokesperson for Bieber told Mailonline soon after: 'It's really sad that people are trying to push a story with no facts so soon after this tragic accident.

'Justin was not present or involved in this incident and the focus should remain on honoring the memory of the victim.'
