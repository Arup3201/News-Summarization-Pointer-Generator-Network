Pope Francis today called for an 'urgent' end to the civil war in Syria on the opening of a three-day trip to Middle East.

The pontiff praised King Abdullah of Jordan for encouraging a 'climate of serene co-existence' between Christians and Muslims in his country.

Pope Francis said: 'Religious freedom is in fact a fundamental human right and I cannot fail to express my hope that it will be upheld throughout the Middle East and the entire world.'

Pope Francis has begun a three-day visit to the Middle East by visiting the supposed site of Christ's baptism on the river Jordan and dipping his hand in the water

Visiting the river alongside one of Jordan's princes, the pontiff stopped and made the sign of the cross

He arrived at Amman's Queen Alia International Airport where he was met by an honour guard as well as Prince Ghazi bin Mohammed, the king's chief advisor for religious affairs, before traveling to the Royal palace.

At the palace, Francis met with Abdullah, Queen Rania and their children. In his palace speech, Francis said Jordan's 'generous welcome' to Syrian refugees warranted international appreciation and support.

It is estimated that there are 600,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict living in camps within Jordan.

Praising 
their hosts, Pope Francis said: 'I thank the authorities of the kingdom 
for all they are doing and I encourage them to persevere in their 
efforts to seek lasting peace for the entire region

'This
 goal urgently requires that a peaceful solution be found to the crisis 
in Syria, as well as a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. 

'Peace isn't something which can be 
bought; it is a gift to be sought patiently and to be crafted through 
the actions, great and small, of our everyday lives.

During the three-day trip to the Holy Land the Pope will also visit Jerusalem and Bethlehem

The Middle East trip is the first for Pope Francis, and only the fourth for a pontiff in the modern era

Later Pope
 Francis met with 600 refugees of the conflict in Bathany, near the site
 where Jesus is believed to have been baptised. 

Pope Francis said the true spirit of Islam, is 'the Islam of peace'.

During his three-day trip, Pope Francis will travel to the West Bank city of Bethlehem before visiting Jerusalem.

Francis
 has a packed schedule for the three-day visit: He will visit a 
Palestinian refugee camp Sunday when he travels from Amman directly to 
the West Bank city of Bethlehem.

It's
 the first time a pope has landed in the West Bank rather than Tel Aviv 
first in a nod by the Vatican to the 'Palestinian state.'

Technically,
 the main reason for the trip is for Francis and the spiritual leader of
 the world's Orthodox Christians to mark the 50th anniversary of a 
historic meeting in Jerusalem by their predecessors which ended 900 
years of Catholic-Orthodox estrangement.

That highlight will come on Sunday, when Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I preside over a joint prayer service in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where Christians believe Jesus was crucified and resurrected.

Francis will spend Monday in Jerusalem, visiting the grand mufti of Jerusalem and Israel's chief rabbis, albeit separately. He'll also pray at the Western Wall and visit the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem.

The Vatican spokesman had suggested that with such a grueling schedule, Francis might not have the strength for an on-board press conference on the return flight from Israel on Monday night.

Francis, 77, who has only one full lung and has battled a cold and fatigue that forced him to cancel some recent appointments, set the record straight at the start of the trip.

'One of you said a press conference wouldn't be possible because this is a "deathly" trip,' he told reporters. 'But returning home, I intend to have one.'
