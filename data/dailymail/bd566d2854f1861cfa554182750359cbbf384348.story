President Barack Obama is under fire this week for the way his White House has excoriated the previous administration for employing tactics it would categorize as torture all the while launching drone strikes on terrorism suspects abroad.

The enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA during the George W. Bush administration on 39 detainees resulted in just one death, Obama's critics have pointed out. Drone strikes conducted by the current occupant of the White House have killed more than 2,400 people.

After claiming all week that the release of a Senate Intelligence Committee report detailing the brutal tactics employed by the Bush administration to elicit information from terrorists was necessary in order for the U.S. to reassert it's 'moral authority,' the White House was forced on Friday to state on record that it doesn't believe its drone policy erodes the moral high ground on which it thinks it stands when it comes to human rights.

President Barack Obama and his administration have been aggressively criticized this week over the number of civilians its drone strikes kill 

Charges of hypocrisy were levied at the Obama administration this week by a former director of the CIA’s National Clandestine Service, Jose Rodriguez, on Tuesday evening after the Senate committee's published its review of the so-called torture program, operated from 2002 - 2007.

Appearing on Sean Hannity's Fox News program that evening, Rodriguez and the conservative television host chastised the Obama administration for its own questionable anti-terrorism tactics.

Hannity wondered how the Obama administration's drone program is 'not far more morally problematic than enhanced interrogation' to the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate's Intelligence Committee.

'This administration does not take any prisoners, they prefer to kill them from afar, using drones,' Rodriguez chimed in. 

'And somehow, they feel that because they kill from a distance, somehow, it’s more ethical … more ethical than the difficult and messy and unpleasant task and mission of actually interrogating prisoners,' he continued, adding, 'I think it’s a distortion of what our values are.'

Hannity went on to say that if he had to choose between being waterboarded, one of the approved interrogation tactics of the Bush administration's CIA, or being droned, he'd prefer to be waterboarded.

'I think I’ll take the waterboarding, too,' Rodriguez replied.

While waterboarding has been the most commonly cited enhanced interrogation technique since Obama banned the use of the harsh tactics during his first days in office, its one of 13 on the list that the CIA used at the time. 

Others include sleep deprivation, cramped confinement, nudity and stress positions. Unapproved tactics that the the Bush administration says the CIA used without authorization were rectal feeding and a process referred to in the report as 'rectal rehydration.'

The White House pushed back on criticism this week that its drone strikes against terrorists kill thousands of innocents by pointing out that ISIS' terror tactics kill substantially more

Taking the argument against the Obama administration drone policies a step further on Wednesday morning former Republican congressman and current MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said present U.S. policy appears to be: 'Let’s just go ahead and just kill them all, and if we kill 5-year-old girls and 85-year-old grandmas, so be it; we feel better about ourselves because that seems cleaner.

'That’s what liberals are saying today,' he charged. 'That’s what [Vice President] Joe Biden’s been saying, that’s what Barack Obama’s been saying.'

Continuing, he claimed 'the drone program went into overdrive on January 21st, 2009' when Obama took office.

'When you talk about five years from now, ten years from now, the information comes out about this drone program, and people actually report on this drone program, it’s going to look a hell of a lot worse, a hell of a lot deadlier, a hell of a lot more random, and a hell of a lot more inhumane than waterboarding three prisoners in 2002 and 2003,' he said.

On Friday Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest was confronted about the possibility that this White House's drone policies would be disparaged by a future administration with as much hostility as the current one is showing the Bush era program.

Earnest told the inquiring reporter, SiriusXm radio's Jared Rizzi, he 'would not envision a scenario where that would occur.'

'Letal operations, lethal counterterrorrism operations, are only conducted as a last resort,' he said, 'and the president has emphasized that extraordinary care needs to be taken' to ensure that such counterterrorism measures are 'carried out in accordance with all applicable domestic and international laws, and are consistent with U.S. values and policy.'

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Friday he doesn't think the Obama administration's drone policy undermines its self-proclaimed 'moral authority'

After stating that '40x more' people 'are affected by drones than held in Guantanamo,' Rizzi then asked Earnest if 'the animating principle here' is 'if the president does it, it is not illegal?'

A visibly irritated Earnest told him, 'No, I think the animating principle here is that the president is committed, in fact, to upholding both American and international law and ensuring that all of the actions that are taken are consistent with our values and our policy.

'Those values are what uphold our moral authority around the globe, and that's why the president is determined to ensure that our counterterrorism operations are consistent with those values,' Earnest said, restating already established administration policy that the United States' 'moral authority'  is one of the 'most powerful tools' in its 'arsenal to protecting American interests around the globe.'

Rizzi pressed the Obama administration further and asked him any aspect of the White House's drone policy undermines its self proclaimed moral authority, at which point Earnest again stressed that 'great precautions are taken' to make sure that innocents are not killed in U.S. drone strikes.

Backing him into a corner, the White House correspondent repeated his question.

'No,' Earnest curtly said before moving on to another reporter's questions. 

Earlier this week Earnest faced a similar cross-examination of administration policy from Fox News' senior White House correspondent, Ed Henry. 

'You have repeatedly talked about moral authority,' Henry said. 'So can you explain how the president believes that it’s un-American to use these [enhanced interrogation] techniques, but it’s OK to ramp up the drone policy and basically thousands of people across the world, innocent civilians were killed?

'What’s the moral equivalency there? How do you have moral authority when innocent civilians are killed by drones?' Henry asked.

Earnest told him there's a 'stark difference in the way the United States conducts our policy, and the way that terrorists around the world conduct their policy,' stating the strict precautions taken.

'I understand there are safeguards,' Henry said. 'But in the end, we’ve seen many cases around the world where U.S. drones have killed innocent civilians despite those safeguards. So how do you have moral authority?' he again asked.

'What I’m saying is that is a stark difference from the tactics that are employed by our enemies, who seek to use car bombs to actually target innocent civilians,' Earnest said, adding that the U.S goes 'to great lengths to protect the lives of innocent civilians.'

'In fact, many of the terrorists that we’re talking about, and again, many of these counterterrorism activities that are used against terrorists are targeting terrorists that themselves have targeted local populations, that have targeted fellow Muslims in some situations. 

'So the efforts that are taken by this administration to limit or to prevent innocent civilian casualties are consistent with our values, and are consistent with our broader strategy for protecting the American people,' he contended.

Asked on Wednesday whether the U.S. still has any moral high ground left in light of the Senate's damning report on the Bush era programs, released the day before, a top U.S. general that oversees the operations at terrorist-holding prison Guantanamo Bay made a similar argument.

“I would say that people who said to me, "Well, we have now lost the moral high ground," I think that’s foolishness,' Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, the chief of U.S. Southern Command told attendees of a human rights summit, per a report in the Washington Post. 

'Some might say that. The jihadists were saying it today,' he noted. 'Gimme a break. [The Islamic State] is telling us we lost the moral high ground? I love it.'
