More than 130 asylum seekers have been moved into a seaside hotel popular with pensioners for dining and entertainment nights, it was revealed today.

They were transferred to the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent, after overcrowding at the three-star Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace, south London, where 600 have been crammed in.

But Damian Collins MP, who represents Folkestone and Hythe, has tried to reassure local residents that the asylum seekers will not be around for long - after learning of what was happening yesterday.

'Spectacular views': More than 130 immigrants have been transferred to the Grand Burstin Hotel (pictured) in Folkestone, Kent, after over-crowding at another hotel in south London, where 600 had been crammed in

Guests at the hotel: The Grand Burstin's website says guests can 'enjoy an excellent day trip to Belgium or France' and promises an 'exquisite dining experience that you won't forget' at the in-house restaurant

Outside: Some residents joked that the hotel's name was apt for a country already 'burstin' full of people

He said: ‘Clearly it’s a decision the 
Home Office has made very quickly, to relieve the situation in Croydon. 
I’ve been reassured that this is only a very temporary move.’

The
 550-room three-star hotel - which has room rates for tonight ranging 
from £34 to £66 - boasts ‘spectacular sea views’ and states it is 
renowned as ‘one of the UK’s top entertainment hotels’.

On
 its website, it also says how guests can ‘relax, dine in style and be 
magically entertained all under one roof.’ Locals say it is particularly
 popular with pensioners for dining and entertainment nights.

Some residents joked that the hotel’s name was apt for a country already ‘burstin' full of people.

Graham
 Sands said: ‘The Great Burstin does not have a great reputation, but 
the name fits perfectly - the UK is burstin’ at the seams with asylum 
seekers and illegal immigrants so it’s the perfect choice.’

A
 spokesman for Shepway District Council said: ‘The Home Office has 
announced that 130 asylum seekers have been transferred to the Grand 
Burstin Hotel in Folkestone.

'We
 have been informed that they will be there for a maximum of two weeks, 
with 30 of them leaving this morning. The decision to locate the asylum 
seekers in Folkestone and how their applications are processed is a 
matter for central government.

Inside: It is not yet clear how much taxpayers will be paying for the rooms, but the hotel's website gives room rates for a two-week stay of £521 to £836 for one person, or £616 to £966 for two sharing

‘Shepway District Council is working closely with partner agencies and Damian Collins MP to monitor the situation.

‘The
 council is keen to keep the local community up-to-date and will share 
information as and when it becomes available through both traditional 
and social media channels and our website.’

It
 is not yet clear how much taxpayers will be paying for the rooms, but 
the hotel’s website gives room rates for a two-week stay of £521 to £836
 for one person, or £616 to £966 for two sharing.

If
 the Home Office were to opt for the £616 price for 130 people, they 
would be booking 65 rooms at that price - totalling £40,040. But the 
Government department has not yet confirmed what it is paying.

A Home Office spokesman said today: ‘The UK has a proud history of offering sanctuary to those who need it.

‘We have made clear to our providers that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term measure and they must make alternative forms of accommodation available as a matter of urgency.

‘The Grand Burstin Hotel will be used for a maximum of two weeks and we have instructed providers to reduce the number staying there as soon as possible.

‘We are working closely with Shepway District Council, who will be kept fully informed.’

And the Refugee Council’s head of 
advocacy Dr Lisa Doyle told MailOnline: ‘The real victims in this story 
are the asylum seekers.

‘First
 they were forced into dangerously overcrowded accommodation through no 
fault of their own and now they’re being shuttled around and pushed from
 pillar to post.

Moved from here: Last week it was revealed how hotel inspectors found 600 asylum seekers crammed into the 98-bedroom Queen's Hotel (pictured) in Crystal Palace, south London

‘Asylum seekers are people who have often fled horrifying experiences in their own countries and have lost everything.

'They are banned from working and are totally reliant on the Government to provide them somewhere safe to sleep at night.’

Last week the Daily Mail
 reported how hotel inspectors found 600 asylum seekers crammed into the
 98-bedroom Queen’s Hotel in Crystal Palace - with nine people sleeping 
in one room alone.

The 
asylum seekers had been placed there, without licensed permission from 
the local authority or consultation with residents, by one of the Home 
Office’s privately run ‘housing providers’.

This had reportedly block-booked the hotel for months at a cost to the taxpayer of £500,000. In 2011/12, the cost of Home Office accommodation provision for asylum-seekers was £150million.

The Grand Burstin’s website also says guests can ‘enjoy an excellent day trip to Belgium or France’ and promises an ‘exquisite dining experience that you won’t forget’ at the in-house restaurant.

The hotel has an average score of three out of five on TripAdvisor, after almost 2,000 reviews.

It is owned by the Britannia Hotels group, which has 47 hotels to its name in Britain - and bought the Grand Burstin in 2004. A company spokesman refused to comment when contacted by MailOnline.

In April of last year, Britannia Hotels was fined £160,000 at Canterbury Crown Court after diners at the hotel were exposed to the risk of inhaling asbestos dust during refurbishment work.

The hotel was opened in 1984 on the site of the 1843 Royal Pavilion Hotel, which housed the likes of author Charles Dickens, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and members of the Rothschild family.
