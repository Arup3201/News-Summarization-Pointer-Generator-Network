Government spy agency GCHQ is accrediting six universities to train the next generation of cyber spooks to combat rising levels of online crime.

The six accredited courses include ‘ethical hacking’, on offer at the University of Lancaster, where students attempt to break into systems to learn how to defend them.

And Napier University in Edinburgh has created a mock online bank, which students can hack into.

Francis Maude, minister for the Cabinet Office, which implements the national cyber security programme along with the Office of Cyber Security, officially announced the certification during a visit to GCHQ in Gloucestershire.

‘Cyber security is a crucial part of this government’s long-term plan for the British economy,’ he said.

‘Through the excellent work of GCHQ, in partnership with other government departments, the private sector and academia, we are able to counter threats and ensure together we are stronger and more aware.’

Mark Hughes, the president of BT’s security team, said there was a ‘skills gap’ for cyber security know-how in the UK and welcomed the arrival of GCHQ’s first accredited courses.

He said: ‘At BT we are acutely aware of the impact of the UK cyber skills gap and recruiting the right people with the right knowledge and skills is a big deal for us. As a leading Internet service provider we want to employ the very best.’

In a bid to make the UK one of the safest places in the world to do online business, the government is ploughing money into the courses.

To qualify for funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, universities must prove they are conducting world class research.

The University of Oxford master’s degree in software and security systems, Edinburgh Napier University’s MSc in advanced security and digital forensics, the University of Lancaster’s master in cyber security and Royal Holloway University of London’s MSc in information security were all accredited by GCHQ.

A further two, Cranfield University’s master in cyber defence and the University of Surrey’s MSc in information security, have been granted provisional certification.

A spokesperson from GCHQ said it marked a significant step in the development of the UK’s knowledge, skills and capability in all fields of cyber security.

Chris Ensor, deputy director for the National Technical Authority for Information Assurance at GCHQ said: ‘As the National Technical Authority for Information Assurance, GCHQ recognises the critical role academia plays in developing the UK's skill and knowledge base.

‘I'd like to congratulate the universities which have been recognised as offering a Master’s degree which covers the broad range of subjects that underpin a good understanding of Cyber Security.’
