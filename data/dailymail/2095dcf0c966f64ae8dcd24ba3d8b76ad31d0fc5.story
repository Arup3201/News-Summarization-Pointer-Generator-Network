Michael M. and John Kirby - both now in their 40s - claim that in the mid-1980s they were lured to the New York apartment of Stephen Brown and subjected to sexual abuse.

While Kirby managed to escape just one encounter, then-prep school student Michael endured repeated and frequent assaults, so much so he came to consider it 'normal'.

'It seems to be that every area of my life is affected,' Michael  told The New York Daily News.

But now, some 30 years later, Brown, 62, is behind bars, after Kirby randomly spotted him going after children in Central Park.

Caught: Stephen Brown, 62, was arrested on March 4 after allegedly planning to meet with a 12-year-old boy in New York and later found in the possession of 11,000 child pornography images. Investigators started looking into Brown after two men, claiming to be former victims of abuse, saw him acting suspiciously in Central Park

Michael M. and Kirby used a Nikon camera and a 300-mm. lens to snap pictures of Brown gleefully interacting with kids at the boat near the Central Park Children's Gate, where he strolled through each day, according to park employees.

They turned the images over to police, who began investigating Brown.

On March 4 they swooped on Brown, arresting him at the Inn on the Hudson in Peekskill, Westchester County, about 40 miles north of New York City, where he allegedly traveled 'to engage in various sexual acts' with a 12-year-old boy.

He was charged with possessing 15 explicit photos — all shot by him — of a then-10-year-old boy, which investigators have confirmed is the same child he was meeting at the inn.

He faces similar charges in Albany County, where he remains in custody, related to alleged conduct at his family’s upstate property.

Authorities say they recovered over 11,000 illicit images from a variety of devices, with more expected to be found.

'Due to the quantity of child pornography that he’s possessed, what he was going to do to a 12-year-old child and the access that he has had to children in the past, both the NYPD and the state police are very concerned that there are multiple victims within the New York City and New York State area over the course of his lifetime,' said state police Senior Investigator Bill Gray, of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.

Seeking prey: Stephen Brown, seen here in his Facebook profile picture, would visit the boat pond at the Central Park Childrens Gate each day, according to workers. It was here bis two former alleged victims were able to get photos of him

Cliff David, who owns the boat rental stand in Central Park that Brown frequented, said he was always cautious of Brown's 'sick smile' and worried about what he was up to.

'I hoped and prayed it was only as far as I saw, because there was nothing I could do,' said David.

Central Park Yacht Club leader John Tucker also said he would watch Brown intently and did not have a good feeling about him.

'We always kept an eye on him,' Tucker, 81, told The News. 

'There were always suspicions from most of the guys.'

Kirby, 41, and Michael M., 42, were students at the Allen-Stevenson school when they first ran into Brown at a luncheonette, which has since closed down.

They would go there with friends to play video games.

The boys, struggling with troubles at home and school, became easy targets for Brown, who soon invited both to his apartment on the Upper East Side.

Brown was in his 30s at the time but told them he was a decade younger. 

A private school graduate, he lived off his family's wealth.

Brown was arrested as he allegedly waited for a planned meeting for a 12-year-old boy in upstate New York. He was also in possession of 15 explicit photos of the same boy when the child was 10

At the apartment they would listen to records, smoke cigarettes and joints and drink tall boys.

'I felt like he was my best friend, as Mike did,' Kirby said.

'So we had what seemed to be a very close friendship.'

Michael M. agreed, saying: 'He was fascinating and he was fascinated in me. At least that’s how it seemed.'

Kirby said he was 15 or 16 when he was abused. After sleeping on the apartment floor, the teen said he awoke to find his fly unzipped and the older man fondling him.

It was the 'most horrible and uncomfortable feeling', said Kirby, who stopped the advance.

Brown apologized and the incident was never mentioned again.

For Michael M., the abuse allegedly began when he was 14 and was regular.

Brown started introducing him to porn.

'He told me I could masturbate if I wanted to,' Michael M said. 

'I don’t remember what his line was, but he took it to the next level and performed fellatio.'

Even after Michael left for boarding school, the encounters continued on weekends and vacations.

'It was a thing that happened that was not spoken about, even when we were alone,' he said. 

'It just sort of happened automatically every night.'

'In a lot of ways my life hasn’t progressed (since).

'It’s hard for me to say how. I’m still discovering that.'

Kirby, now a father, said he hopes the story will reach other victims of abuse, and said he has a message for those people.

'I know you think he’s your best friend and a great guy,' said Kirby.

'But the fact is he’s really sick.'
