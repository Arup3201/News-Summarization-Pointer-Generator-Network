A cargo ship which spilled hundreds of tons of oil remained perched on a New Zealand reef today, as locals descended on a nearby beach to scavenge from the vessel's washed-up load.

Salvage crews are still debating whether the remaining fuel on the Liberian-flagged Rena can be pumped from the ship before it breaks up.

And as rescue crews tried to stabilise the ship, local residents in Tauranga, New Zealand, have been spotted inspecting the containers of cargo and surveying the disaster from the shore.

Further inspection of the washed-up cargo showed the beach littered with thousands of part-cooked meat patties from one of the Rena's containers

But anyone hoping for a valuable haul from the stricken vessel would have turned up disappointed - as the Rena mainly shed thousands of partly-cooked burgers on to the sand.

The ship itself is being slowly battered to pieces by pounding waves, with rescuers needing to stabilise the Rena before any oil transfer can start.

Environmentalists have warned of a disaster for wildlife if all the ship's 1,870 tons (1,700 metric tons) of oil and 220 tons (200 metric tons) of diesel is allowed to spill into the ocean.

Crews attempting to start the salvage effort have also been hampered by the severe structural damage sustained on the vessel.

Meanwhile, several of the 88 containers that have fallen off its deck had washed ashore by Thursday, and authorities confirmed one container that toppled overboard contained a hazardous substance.

However, an official said it should not pose a major threat.

Heavy seas had kept salvage crews away from the 775-foot (236-meter) vessel for days, but a break in the weather allowed three team members to be winched aboard the Liberian-flagged Rena, which ran aground Oct 5 on Astrolabe Reef, 14 miles (22 kilometers) from Tauranga Harbour on New Zealand's North Island.

Ewart Barnsley, spokesman for Maritime New Zealand which is managing the emergency response, said the salvage crew found oil hoses and pumps for transferring fuel largely undamaged aboard the ship.

They also concluded that the ship was safe to work from.

Barnsley said a barge was moored nearby to receive oil, but a decision on when that transfer might start would not be made before Friday.

Marine New Zealand salvage manager Bruce Anderson said the vessel needed to stop moving before the oil could be pumped out and it apparently had.

'While this is good news, we shouldn't get too excited,' Anderson told reporters. 'We already had a complex project to start with; it's even harder now that we've sustained damage aboard this vessel,' he said, referring to recent structural cracking.

A vertical crack in the ship runs around the entire vessel - meaning the ship is now only held together by its internal components, said Steve Jones, another spokesman for Maritime New Zealand.

'The reality is the vessel could break up at any point,' Jones told The Associated Press.

Six vessels have been mobilized to intercept the drifting containers and other debris in the water.

There were 1,368 containers on board, 11 of which contained hazardous substances, Maritime New Zealand said. One of the hazardous containers is among those that have fallen overboard, Jones said.

Agency spokesman Nick Bohm said the 
container held alkyl sulfonic acid, which can be harmful in its original
state, but becomes less toxic when diluted with water. The whereabouts 
of that container are unknown.

Some
of the contents of containers that had washed ashore were strewn across
the coastline on Thursday, including thousands of meat patties that 
littered the sand.

The 
ship's 44-year-old Filipino captain was charged Wednesday with operating
a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk and was 
released on bail Wednesday at Tauranga District Court.

The ship's second officer appeared in the same court Thursday on the same charge. Judge Robert Wolff made orders suppressing publication of the defendants' names for the sake of their personal safety.

If convicted, each could face a fine of up to 10,000 New Zealand dollars ($7,800) and 12 months in prison. Their next court appearance is Oct. 19, when authorities say more charges are likely.

The government has demanded to know why the ship crashed into the well-charted reef in calm weather, but the vessel's owner, Greece-based Costamare Inc., has given no explanation.

On Thursday, Costamare released a statement apologizing for the incident and said it was investigating how the ship could have run aground.
