Passengers on a flight from London to the US watched as the aircraft dumped fuel over the English Channel as they spent  four hours circling above the Isle of Wight.

More than 200 passengers and 13 crew were on board United Airlines flight UA28, which took off from Heathrow at 11am yesterday on its way to Newark airport New York.

But the Boeing 767-400 developed a 'maintenance issue' soon after take-off and the pilot started circling over southern England before landing back at Heathrow shortly before 4pm.

Manchester's Marcus Mollinga, 20, was on board the plane with his girlfriend Abby Stokes and told how passengers endured hours of flying in a circle in bad turbulence.

He told MailOnline: 'It took off okay but about an hour and a half in we were told we were flying back to Heathrow.

'The pilot said he had to dump about 20,000 lbs of fuel and the cabin pressure was low so we had to fly at low altitude.

'It was a bit scary, as we were just circling for hours and because of the low altitude we were flying through cloud most of the time, so there was a lot of turbulence.

'United Airlines didn't handle it very well, they kept telling us it would be one more hour, then one more and it just went on.

'Some Americans were kicking off about it and some one claimed the plane would "blow up" if we tried to fly to the US.'

The plane flew over the Channel for more than four hours before landing, where it was examined by engineers

Mr Mollinga and Miss Stokes, along with other passengers, had to stay overnight near Heathrow and  were put on flights this morning.

Video and photos taken by passengers shows the fuel being dumped from a pipe on the wing of the Boeing 767-400.

Heathrow airport said the problem was not dealt with as an emergency and the plane returned due to the technical fault. 

A spokesman for United Airlines said: 'Flight UA28 from London Heathrow to New York/Newark on December. 17, 2014, a Boeing 767-400 aircraft with 227 customers and a crew of 13 on board, returned to Heathrow because of a maintenance issue.

'The aircraft landed safely and arrived at the gate at 3:59 p.m. local time. Our maintenance team is currently inspecting the aircraft.

'Our customer service team at Heathrow is providing assistance to customers and is making arrangements for them to complete their journeys. We regret any inconvenience experienced by our customers.'
