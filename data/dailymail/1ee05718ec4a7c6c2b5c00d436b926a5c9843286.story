Gareth Bale's back. Usually words to hearten Wales manager Chris Coleman as his outstanding talent returns from Spain. On Sunday they caused him to accentuate the difference between playing at risk and playing in pain.

The world's most expensive footballer will start against Cyprus on Monday night in the hugely important Euro 2016 qualifier, but he does so nursing a sore back.

Back among the goals is where Wales want him and Coleman made it clear Bale is always eager to perform for his country no matter what niggles he may be carrying.

But he also stressed, in case Carlo Ancelotti was listening, that there is no danger of worsening the problem. 'He's not playing for us every time at 100 per cent,' admitted Coleman. 'There's a protocol between Real Madrid's medical team and ours but we've never risked him.

'The last thing we want to do is send him back injured. But if there's not a big risk, if there's a chance of getting through the game in a little bit of pain, that's all right.

'That's that attitude which gets you team spirit and trusting each other. It's happening more and more, the lads are playing with knocks and niggles.'

The winces will be worth it if they lead to a win, and Bale has shown that desire for Wales. He came to the touchline during the Bosnia draw after taking a knock to his back to speak to Wales's medical team but continued and almost won three points with a stunning drive.

His significance to the team is evident in Coleman's telling of that episode, which was delivered with tongue in cheek, Real should note.

'He had a kick but he's all right,' said Coleman. 'In the game the other night he came to the side but whatever he was saying my ears were closed because if there was an issue he wasn't coming off. We gave him treatment, he had a bit of strapping but he's fine.'

Wales are down to the 'bare bones' in Coleman's words, with Jonny Williams forced out with an ankle injury sustained in heavy challenges on Friday night. Midfield is already missing Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and three others — meaning a switch in formation to incorporate Hal Robson-Kanu out wide is likely. Bale should continue up front alongside Simon Church. 

This is a match Wales must win if they are to hold realistic ambitions of qualifying, which means another goalless draw would underwhelm.

Ashley Williams had a glorious chance to win the Bosnia game, but headed over from Bale's cross with 12 minutes left. The captain said is still 'kicking' himself.

But he make amends with another solid defensive display. If there is a victory, you can expect another huddle like the one against Bosnia.

'It shows how together we are,' he said. 'We are a tight group and we get on a lot better now than teams gone past.'
