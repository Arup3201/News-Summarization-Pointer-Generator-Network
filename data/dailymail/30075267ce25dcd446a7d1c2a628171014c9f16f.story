A string of little villages on the island of Hainan, off China’s south coast, is supposedly home to one of the longest-lived groups of people on earth.

Chengmai claims to have one of the highest ratios of centenarians in the world - more than 200 residents out of a population of 560,000.

It also prides itself to at least three ‘supercentenarians’ – residents aged over 110 – meaning they claim nearly one per cent of the less than 400 thought to exist worldwide.

Communities with a higher than normal percentage can be found across the globe.

Discovered on Cuba, Greek islands, in 
Japan and on a peninsula in Costa Rica, researchers find that they share
common traits in the way they live their lives.

All live in close-knit communities 
with emphasis on family lives, their rural locations and tradition means
their lifestyles require [physical activity in some way – many are 
farmers – and their diet is mainly plant-based.

This can definitely be said to be true for Chengmai.

Its elderly residents have seen the 
rise and fall of the Republic of China, the coming of Communism, one – 
or in some cases even two – world wars and the revolution of technology,
yet little has changed in the way the population of Chengmai’s villages
live their lives.

Family matters: Hu Aihe, right, talking with her sister-in-law in Chengmai city, an area where the longevity of residents has been credited to close-knit families

Staying active: Researchers credit strong family ties and life of physically demanding labour, such as agricultural work, with keeping the Chengmai residents living for more than a century

They have always been, and still remains, an agricultural people.

‘I've never done any exercise, except hard farmwork,’ 86 year-old Wang Kailu told AFP.

He lives in a simple concrete shack 
with his wife Wu Aihe, who he married the day after Japan's World War 
Two surrender, 68 years ago.

Their one-storey dwelling is barely 
furnished and Wang draws water from a well to spread on his small 
vegetable plot – but despite his age he still grows crops.

Researchers hail this simple lifestyle as one of the key ingredients for the longevity of Chengmai’s residents.

Jennifer Holdaway, who runs the China 
Environment and Health Initiative of the US-based Social Science 
Research Council, said: ‘There is not a lot of industry, the climate is 
good, they can get exercise easily, and the diet is healthy.

‘They have plenty of fresh fruit and 
vegetables, and the soil is also naturally high in selenium, an 
essential nutrient,’ she told AFP.

As one: Xu Yuhe, 103, listen in during a family get-together at her house in Chengmai city, where it is claimed there are more elderly residents than anywhere else in the world

Memories: Xu Yuhe, born in 1909, has seen the rise and fall of the Republic of China, the birth of Communist China, two world wars and the Japanese occupation

Proof: Xu Yuhe, is having a rest as her daughter-in-law checks her birth certificate, showing that she is, in fact, over 100 years old

‘If you're living in a climate like 
that you don't need very much to be comfortable: simple housing, a 
mosquito net, some rattan chairs and other people to hang out with,’ Ms Holdaway added.

A study commissioned by Chengmai's 
Communist Party committee put its residents' lifespans down to their 
being  ‘diligent, simple-minded and magnanimous, mainly taking a 
vegetarian diet, eating sensibly, early to bed early to rise.’

However, if you ask the locals, it is something completely different that keeps them going.

Xu Yuhe, whose residency permit lists 
her as 104, said the key to her long life is her daily shots of ‘Three 
Coconut Spring’ a local grain spirit.

‘I drink alcohol every evening, just a
little bit, it helps you feel warm,’ added Sheng She, an 80-year-old 
who says she has 31 children and grandchildren.

Friendships: A group of elderly men playing at a tea house in Chengmai city

Community: The elderly population gather daily for banter, games, opera and exercise at the local teahouses around Chengmai

In it to win it: Wrinkled hands check the domino bricks as the group of elderly men play a game over coins and rocks

Healthy reasons: While researchers hail the climate, simple lifestyles and a close-knit community, locals praise everything from alcohol to peanut oil for keeping them young
