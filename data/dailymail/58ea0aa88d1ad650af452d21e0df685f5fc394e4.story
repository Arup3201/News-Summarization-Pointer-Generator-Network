The victim, who needed hospital treatment for his injuries,Â told Local 4 Defenders, that he had tried to fight the attacker off but grew increasingly weak from blood loss.

The man suspected of carrying out the stabbing was seen on CCTV outside the gas station where he first confronted the victim.

He followed the man into the station where he carried out the frenzied assault as at least two other men watched.

The owner of the gas station owner said it was 'sad' the people who witnessed the attack did not intervene.

'Both of these guys could have helped. They could have grabbed him,' he told Local 4 Defenders.

Police believe the suspect is likely to live in the immediate area. The man who was attacked is expected be able to return home from hospital next week.
