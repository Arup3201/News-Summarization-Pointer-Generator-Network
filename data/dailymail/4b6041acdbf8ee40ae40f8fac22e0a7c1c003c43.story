Lazio have opened talks over a bid to sign Ravel Morrison from West Ham.

Morrison has been told he can leave for free this month, even though he has a reputed £18million buyout clause in his contract.

Lazio delegates have been in London for business meetings and have been alerted to Morrison’s situation following his return from an inauspicious loan at Cardiff.

A move to Italy would have to wait until the summer though as Morrison has played in two countries - England and Wales - this season and FIFA don't allow a third.

If he gets his contract cancelled he could sign a short-term deal with another English club and Lazio could pick up again at the end of the season. 

If West Ham insist on keeping registration they can pay a fee in summer.

West Ham are asking for a percentage of any sell-on and there is interest from other clubs also.

As manager Sam Allardyce prepares his side for Tuesday’s FA Cup replay with Everton, he has said that exiled forward Morrison will one day regret not taking his advice on how to fulfil his potential at West Ham.

Morrison has no future at the club and he has been forced to train with the Under 21s since his return from a disappointing loan spell at Cardiff last month.

In his latest row at West Ham, Morrison is in dispute with the club for not receiving his full £60,000 wages for December, after being fined for misconduct, and has called in the Professional Footballers’ Association to help.

Allardyce said: ‘Most young talented players I worked with over many, many years who I’ve met later have said, “Oh, I wish I’d listened to you”.

‘When you meet them later in life they regret not taking the opportunity with the talent they had. It’s never just about talent, it’s about a lot more than that.

‘You can lead the horse to water but you can’t make it drink. There’s only a certain amount of times you can tell somebody what they should or shouldn’t be doing. If they don’t want to take it on board there’s little you can do.

‘It’s very difficult to sit and watch such a great talent wasted. In Ravel’s position, the talent is there, he just has to change his whole life and then hopefully somewhere down the line he’ll become the player he should be.’

Morrison has been told to look for another club but the player does not want to leave until he has settled this dispute. West Ham insist they have followed internal disciplinary procedures.

Allardyce added: ‘Rav didn’t perform at Cardiff. If he’d have done the business there he could have created a much more healthy position for himself either back here or somewhere else, but he was on the fringes of the team.’

Meanwhile, Leighton Baines has explained how crucial the FA Cup is to Everton’s season.

‘We are not seeing the FA Cup as a distraction,’ said the left back. ‘Being in the cups gives you hope and optimism for the second half of the season.

‘It is important we pick up our league form and get back up the table but, realistically, optimism is going to come from the cups.

‘If we go to West Ham and get a good win, it changes everything.’
