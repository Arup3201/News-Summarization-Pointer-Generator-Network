Three U.S. senators including John McCain have attacked the makers of 'Zero Dark Thirty', claiming its central claim that torture produced the breakthrough that led the CIA to Osama bin Laden is 'grossly inaccurate and misleading.'

Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin and McCain - all members of the Senate Intelligence committee - sent a letter yesterday to the head of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Michael Lynton, to register their complaint.

They urged Lynton to 'consider correcting the impression that the CIA's use of coercive interrogation techniques led to the operation against Osama bin Laden' and insisted that the waterboarding of al-Qaida's No. 3 leader, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, did not provide information that led to the bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.

Sen. John McCain has criticised the new Osama bin Laden hunt movie 'Zero dark Thirty' for its 'misleading' portrayal of torture

However, the makers of the eagerly anticipated movie, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, said disputed that interpretation and encouraged people to see their movie, already considered a top Oscar contender, before characterizing it.

'We depicted a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding bin Laden,' said Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal in a statement. 

'The film shows that no single method was necessarily responsible for solving the manhunt, nor can any single scene taken in isolation fairly capture the totality of efforts the film dramatizes.'

In addition, the filmmakers credited the 'hard work and dedication' of the intelligence community in finding and ultimately killing the mastermind of the 9/11 atrocity in which almost 3,000 people lost their lives.

But the senators said that after viewing the film they were left with the overall impression that torture of detainees led directly to the information on the courier who led U.S. operatives to the bin Laden compound in Pakistan.

'We are fans of many of your movies, and we understand the special role that movies play in our lives, but the fundamental problem is that people who see 'Zero Dark Thirty' will believe that the events it portrays are facts,' the three senators wrote.

'The film therefore has the potential to shape American public opinion in a disturbing and misleading manner.'

'Regardless of what message the filmmakers intended to convey, the movie clearly implies that the CIA's coercive interrogation techniques were effective in eliciting important information related to a courier for Usama Bin Laden. We have reviewed CIA records and know that this is incorrect,' they wrote.

'Zero Dark Thirty is factually inaccurate, and we believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative.'

Last year, McCain asked then-CIA Director Leon Panetta for the facts, and he said the hunt for bin Laden did not begin with fresh information from Mohammed. In fact, the name of bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, came from a detainee held in another country.

Feinstein, who heads the Intelligence committee, backed up McCain's assessment that waterboarding of Mohammed did not produce the tip that led to bin Laden.

In their letter to Sony, the lawmakers said the "use of torture in the fight against terrorism did severe damage to America's values and standing that cannot be justified or expunged. It remains a stain on our national conscience.

We cannot afford to go back to these dark times, and with the release of 'Zero Dark Thirty,' the filmmakers and your production studio are perpetuating the myth that torture is effective. You have a social and moral obligation to get the facts right."

Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal said in a statement from Sony that they depicted "a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding bin Laden."

Bigelow and Boal, who won Oscars for 'The Hurt Locker,' said the new film showed that no single method was responsible in the successful manhunt for bin Laden, and no single scene in isolation captures the total effort the movie dramatizes.

McCain said he watched the movie Monday night after receiving a copy.

'Zero Dark Thirty' is opening in New York and Los Angeles this week. It opens across the country next month.

The eagerly antiicpated movie was produced in collaboration with CIA insiders and Oscar winning director Kathryn Bigelow enjoyed almost unprecedented access to security information about the hunt for bin Laden who was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 2nd 2011.

CIA insiders have confirmed claims by the film’s director Kathryn Bigelow that she is entirely justified in focusing on the role played by a junior female CIA analyst, named Maya in the film and played by Jessica Chastain.

Integral: The real-life agent who spearheaded the raid is reportedly furious that other agents- who she feels slowed down the progress of the search- were given awards for their work

Although the woman is still undercover and has never been identified, Zero Dark Thirty’s emphasis on Maya’s importance tallies with the account of a U.S. Navy SEAL involved in the raid who later wrote about it in a book.

Matt Bissonnette writes in No Easy Day of flying out to Afghanistan before the raid with a CIA analyst he called ‘Jen’ who was ‘wicked smart, kind of feisty’ and liked to wear expensive high heels.

She had devoted the best part of a decade to finding Bin Laden and had become the SEALs’ go-to expert on intelligence matters about their target, he said.

And while her colleagues were only 60 per cent sure their quarry was in the compound in Abbottabad, she told the SEAL she was 100 per cent certain.

‘I can’t give her enough credit, I mean, she, in my opinion, she kind of teed up this whole thing,’ Bissonnette said later.

The commando saw a very different 
side of her days later when they brought Bin Laden’s body back to their 
Afghan hangar. Having previously told Bissonnette she didn’t want to see
the body, ‘Jen’ stayed at the back of the crowd as they unzipped the 
terrorist’s body bag.

She
‘looked pale and stressed’ and started crying. ‘A couple of the SEALs 
put their arms around her and walked her over to the edge of the group 
to look at the body,’ wrote Bissonnette. ‘She didn’t say 
anything . . . with tears rolling down her cheeks, I could tell it was 
taking a while for Jen to process.

She’d spent half a decade tracking this man. And now there he was at her feet.’

Although
she remains active as a CIA analyst, it is believed Mark Boal, 
Bigelow’s screenwriter, was allowed to interview her at length. It has 
emerged that she is in her 30s and joined the CIA after leaving college 
and before the 9/11 attacks turned American security upside down.
