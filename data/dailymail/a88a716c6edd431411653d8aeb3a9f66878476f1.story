Nigel Farage faced a backlash from his own supporters last night after calling for Britain to admit refugees from the civil war in Syria.

Supporters of the UK Independence Party denounced their leader after Mr Farage used an interview with the BBC yesterday to call for Britain to allow those fleeing Syria to come to the UK.

He said refugees fleeing from conflicts were ‘a very different thing’ from economic migrants.

Nigel Farage has become the target of fury from his own supporters after suggesting the Britain should accept Syrian refugees during a debate with the BBC yesterday

But he was attacked online by UKIP supporters - who said the country was already ‘full up’ and warned they would no longer vote for UKIP unless he changes his mind.

Mr Farage’s policy goes further than the Coalition, which has limited its help to financial support for countries taking in refugees.

The UKIP leader said: ‘I think refugees are a very different thing to economic migration and I think this country should honour the 1951 declaration on refugee status that was agreed.

‘The original ideas of defining what a refugee is were good ones and I think, actually, there is a responsibility on all of us in the free West to try and help some of those people fleeing Syria, literally in fear of their lives.’

Mr Farage argued that a refugee - fleeing a country fearing for their life - and a migrant who moves to earn more money are two different things

Mr Farage called for ‘a proper debate’ about ‘the difference between a refugee - who fears for his or her life - or somebody moving simply for economic benefit’.

He did not put a figure on how many of the nine million Syrians displaced by war who should be allowed into the UK, but Labour has said Britain should accept up to 500.

Mr Farage’s intervention appeared to be an attempt to show voters that UKIP is not opposed to all immigration following months of accusations from political rivals that the party is racist.

But the move backfired immediately as UKIP supporters flocked to the party’s Facebook page to denounce the plans.

Building contractor Mark Burns said: ‘I suggest that you get Nigel to clarify his comments so as we UKIP voters retain our faith in him and his party.

'UKIP was our salvation, so why even consider making such ludicrous comments. Is he losing the plot? Clarify or lose many voters.’

Truck driver Mark Andrew Royston added: ‘Stuff the UKIP. I was going to vote for these, not now. Sorry, [the] UK is full already.’

Ricky Mckinnell accused Mr Farage of having ‘lost touch with reality’ and asked: ‘Or you have been bought? Got to rethink my vote.’

Keith Goddard added: ‘I’ve backed UKIP for ages but if this is how he is going to do it, I’ll cut my ties.’

James Read wrote: ‘Beginning to think you’re just another out of touch politician. Recently you come across that you haven’t got a clue about what’s going on here.’

Helena Pigott wrote: ‘We are full up. We need to get our country back on a sound financial footing, we cannot take on the responsibility of the world on our shoulders, think again Nigel.’

Mark Burns wrote: ‘Nigel, Syrian refugees need to be safe from the civil war in their country, but bring them here. I think not! Our country is overcrowded as it is and to suggest things like this is ludicrous.

So far nine million people have been displaced in the Syrian civil war and have fled to neighboring countries including Jordan, where roughly 115,000 are camped (pictured)

‘I am disappointed that you have suggested such a thing. These people would need financial aid, housing and the use of our schools and hospitals, therefore [they would be] a huge financial burden on our society .

'This was the one main reason I support[ed] UKIP, I am starting to have doubts now.’

Billy Weir said: ‘I liked what was being said in the beginning when we thought you as a party were standing up for Britain.

'Now it seems that you are sitting down with the rest, spouting the same old rhetoric. Disappointed.’

Tory MP Mark Pritchard backed Mr Farage. ‘Clearly we can’t take all the refugees but we should play our part as an open-hearted, compassionate country,’ he said.

Farage's policy goes further than the government, who are so far only offering financial aid to victims

Former shadow minister David Davis said: ‘It’s about Mr Farage trying to reposition his party so that the anti-immigration argument, which is so important to them, is not seen as a barbaric argument, so from that point of view there is a bit of political positioning going on.

‘It’s not a bad idea but it will be incredibly complicated; it will need to involve the entire European Union, probably the US, probably Japan, maybe even Russia; pretty much the entire Western world will have to pick up the burden because we’re talking possibly of millions of people.’

Fellow Conservative Andrew Brigden branded Mr Farage’s comments ‘political tokenism’.

‘These are Syrian people who want to live in Syria. The solution is not taking a few hundred people to make us feel happier,’ he said. ‘What we need is a politically-negotiated solution to this problem.’
