A South Korean woman got a rude awakening when she left her robot vacuum to do the cleaning while she took a nap.

Instead of waking up to a spotless home, the 52-year-old, from Changwon city, had to be rescued by the fire department.

The vacuum cleaner reportedly mistook the woman for dust, locked on to her hair and tried to suck it up.

A South Korean woman had to be freed from her robot vacuum cleaner by paramedics after it sucked up her hair while she was napping on the floor of her home in Changwon city 

The vacuum's suction was far from gentle, and wretched the woman from her slumber. The woman's hair then became entangled in the cleaning device.

The woman, who has not been named, was unable to free herself  and called the fire department with a 'desperate rescue plea'.

She was later freed from the vacuum by paramedics, according to the Guardian.

The woman was not seriously injured. It is not known if she has retained the futuristic cleaning device.  

Korean Biz Wire reported that people from cultures where sleeping on the floor is normal - such as Korea - are at risk of being rudely awoken by their robot vacuums

Robot vacuum cleaners are slowly becoming commonplace. U.S firm iRobot has sold more than 10 million of its circular Roomba vacuum since it came on market in 2002 and Panasonic recently released a triangular rival called the Rulo.

The vacuums use sensors to navigate around obstacles and avoid falling off surfaces, while sucking up dust and debris. They can also be programmed to find a recharging dock.  

Korean Biz Wire reported that people from cultures where sleeping on the floor is normal - like Korea - are far more likely to come into conflict with their robot vacuums.
