Brian Stonehouse joined the Royal Artillery in 1939 but his skills in French and as an illustrator proved invaluable in identifying four fellow spies killed in a concentration camp and led to a career at Vogue

It was supposed to be the perfect disguise - an English spy with a proficient command of French posing as an art student to transmit information from inside Nazi-occupied France. 

But the sketching skills of Brian Stonehouse later proved invaluable both in his work for the British military in identifying victims of fellow spies who died in concentration camps, and later in forging a successful career in fashion.

The soldier turned spy was eventually spotted by Vogue, who employed him as an illustrator and he became among one of the best known in the profession.

An exhibition of Stonehouse's works is currently being displayed in London, charting his extraordinary career that started when he joined the Royal Artillery and saw him awarded an MBE after his work as a secret agent. 

Stonehouse was an art student in the 1930s when he joined the Royal Artillery in 1939 and was posted on Guard Duty to the Orkney Islands.

However his skills, particularly as a soldier fluent in French, were being wasted and he was soon recruited to work in Special Operations Executive (SOE) - a group of secret agents who were deployed across Nazi Europe to give information. 

His disguise was one of a French arts student called Michel Chapuis and he was sent to France with a radio hidden in his artist's box to transmit intelligence back to Britain.

However after just three-and-a-half months he was captured and sent to a series of prisons and concentration camps over two years where he was tortured, put in solitary confinement and forced to carry out slave labour. 

During this time he was sent to five concentration and labour camps; Neue Bremm (Saarbrüchen), Mauthausen, Wiener Neudorf, Natzweiler-Struthof and Dachau until April 1945. 

But despite his incarceration Stonehouse's skills as an illustrator proved vitally important. 

While in Natzweiler he saw four women being marched to their deaths and later sketched their faces from memory. These sketches later helped identify four missing SOE agents from their photographs. 

He was often known as a spirited survivor. In Wiener Neudorf the guards made him draw portraits of them and their families. And in Natzweiler-Struthof he organised theatrical performances to distract prisoners as well as guards. 

Stonehouse became well known for his work in Vogue, including Two Studies of a Day Dress, 1955

His iconic style led to a successful career at Vogue with illustrations such as The Complete Outfit 1952

Stonehouse survived the war and was a witness in the War Crimes Tribunals where by chance he met New York socialite Harry Haller. 

Haller supported Stonehouse's move to America in 1946 and spotted his illustration skills. He was recommended as a portrait artist, but as fashion began to gain more popularity, his work was spotted by Jessica Daves, editor of Vogue. 

In 1952 he was appointed as an illustrator for the magazine - the first time one had been taken on by Vogue since 1939. 

Stonehouse worked there until 1962 and died of a heart attack in 1998.

The discovery of his works was also an unusual  tale.

Stonehouse forged a successful career at Vogue for more than 10 years and his works are being exhibited 

'The Pencil Skirt' 1955 (left) and The Checked Dress (right) were designs that featured in Vogue magazine 

He stored the work he had done between 1952 and 1958 at his brother's house in Suffolk. It was not until recently when his brother, then 97, moved house that he discovered his works. 

Some of his drawings of his experience of the war are on display in the Imperial War Museum while his accomplishments published in Vogue are being displayed at London gallery Abbott and Holder.

Philip Athill, managing director at the gallery, said the exhibition had been very popular. 

Stonehouse posed for his picture in 1942 when he assumed the identity of a French art student 

He said: 'It's very very rare that you get a person that has such a rare story to tell. Two authors have already expressed an interest in writing a book on him and his story was so extraordinary I can easily see it being made into a film.' 

Boston collector Frederic Sharf came across some of Stonehouse's works at an auction house and got in touch with the Imperial War Museum and his brother to piece together the illustrator's history to write 'Brian Stonehouse: Artist, Soldier, War Hero, Fashion Illustrator.'

The exhibition of Stonehouse's works will be held at Abbott and Holder until Christmas Eve.
