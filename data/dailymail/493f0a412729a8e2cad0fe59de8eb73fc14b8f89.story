A scathing new report ordered in the wake of the September 19 intrusion into the White House by an armed veteran has found that the Secret Service needs some major overhauls.

Included in the report was a finding that the White House's physical security needs tightening in the form of taller fences--at least four to five feet on top of the existing 7.5 feet.

The panel also spoke to the needs of the agents themselves saying they need better training, more manpower and fresh leadership.

Changes already? Construction workers were seen working on a fence near the Northwest Gate of the White House in Washington on Thursday

A report out this week finds that Secret Services upgrades are badly needed and include White House fences that are at least 4 to 5 feet higher, more and better trained agents and fresh leadership

'The next director will have to make difficult choices, identifying clear priorities for the organization and holding management accountable for any failure to achieve those priorities,' the group wrote after interviewing 50 Secret Service employees. 'Only a director from outside the (Secret) Service, removed from organizational traditions and personal relationships, will be able to do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment this will require.'

Too insular: The review found that fresh leadership is needed in the Secret Service, which it said has become too insular

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement that the recommendations are 'astute, thorough and fair.'

Many of the proposed changes have been recommended before, including some that date to the Warren Commission Report, which detailed the government investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Johnson said Thursday the recommendations can't fall by the wayside this time.

The panelists were former Obama administration Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli; former Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip, who served during Bush's term; Danielle Gray, a former assistant to the president for President Barack Obama; and Joe Hagin, deputy chief of staff for operations during the Bush administration.

This was the second critical report of the agency and its operations in as many months following the Sept. 19 incident, in which a Texas Army veteran armed with a small knife was able to climb over a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being subdued. In November, an internal review concluded that training, poor staffing and a series of missteps contributed to the breach. 

Among the mistakes made were that officers had believed that thick shrubbery would stop the intruder from making into the building. 

Ousted: Julia Pierson was forced to resign as director a day after testifying about the White House breach. Retired Secret Service Agent Joseph Clancy has been acting director since shortly after Pierson's ouster. The new review concluded the Secret Service needs fresh leadership from outside the agency

The independent panel also concluded that training and lack of staffing was also a serious problem for presidential security. The panel recommended hiring at least 85 agents and 200 uniformed officers. They also recommended that uniformed officers should spend at least 10 percent of their time training. Current staffing levels only allowed for about 25 minutes of training in 2013, the panel said.

The panel also suggested replacing the 7 1/2-foot fence around the 18-acre White House complex, although they declined 'to say precisely what the optimal new fence should look like.'

The panel made more than 19 recommendations, though many of those directly related to security were deemed classified and not included in the summary.
