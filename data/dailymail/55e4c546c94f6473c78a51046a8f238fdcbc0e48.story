A wildlife expert found himself repeatedly attacked by an angry swan as he tried to free one of his cygnets who was stuck in a fence,

Simon Cowell was filmed as he attempted to free the young swan who had become trapped on a chain link fence on the banks of the River Thames.

But as Mr Cowell, who runs Surrey-based charity Wildlife Aid, rescued the cygnet, its angry father, known as a cob, began viciously attacking him.

In footage shot during the rescue mission, the swan is seen stretching his wings and whacking Mr Cowell, as he turns around and shouts: 'Don’t be silly - stop it!' to the cob.

Mr Cowell then ploughs ahead with his bid to push the trapped cygnet back through the tiny hole he had become stuck in.

And even after releasing the baby back to the water and reuniting it with its father - the cob continues to angrily lash out.

Mr Cowell said he had not been too bothered by the unexpected attack.

'Everyone is happy, they are all back together again and I’ve got a bruised arm,' he said.
