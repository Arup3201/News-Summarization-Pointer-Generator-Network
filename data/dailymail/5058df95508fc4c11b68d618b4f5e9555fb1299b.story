Celtic suffered a 3-2 defeat to Sparta Prague as they rounded off their winter training camp in Gran Canaria.

Leigh Griffiths put a youthful Hoops outfit ahead inside the first minute after a great pass from Beram Kayal sent him in on goal.

But the Scottish champions were pegged back when former Reading midfielder Marek Matejovsky rifled Sparta level after 24 minutes, while Ladislav Krejci slotted past Lukasz Zaluska soon after to put the Czechs in charge.

Borek Dockal slotted away the spot-kick but despite seeing Under-17s captain Joe Thomson pull a goal back midway through the second half, Ronny Deila's men failed to rally in the final stages.

Celtic, who postponed last weekend's fixture with St Johnstone to fly out to the Canaries, now return to Scottish Premiership action on Saturday when they travel to Hamilton.
