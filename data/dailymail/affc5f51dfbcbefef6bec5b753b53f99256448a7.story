It may look eminently respectable with its neat, double-fronted facade – but this house hides scandalous Royal secrets.

In the 1930s, the property – now on the market for £18 million – was the love nest of the Prince of Wales, who later became Edward VIII and famously stunned the nation by abdicating to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

In 1930 the mansion, just north of Regent’s Park, was the London home of Viscountess Furness, who was then Edward’s mistress. And it may also be the place where Edward romanced Mrs Simpson, since it is claimed that she also stayed there and was visited by the Prince.

Historian Anne Sebba, who wrote the Duchess of Windsor’s biography, That Woman: The Life Of Wallis Simpson, said of the Prince of Wales: ‘He liked to visit his mistresses in their own home.'

Lady Furness lived in the mansion with her husband, Marmaduke, the first Viscount Furness.

He was chairman of Furness Withy shipbuilders and one of the richest men in Britain at the time. His wife, Thelma, was an American socialite. 

Wallis Simpson’s husband Ernest was a shipping executive, and both he and Wallis were American by birth. The two couples were introduced to each other through a mutual friend at the US Embassy in London.

The Prince was part of the Furnesses’ 
set. Apart from their London home in Elsworthy Road, which was then 
known as Kirbygate, the Furnesses had a prestigious country house, 
Burrough Court, near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire – prime foxhunting
territory.

The Prince, a passionate devotee of field sports, was a 
regular guest.

Seok Swycher, who owns the Elsworthy Road house with her husband Stuart, an international property developer, is curious to find out for certain the role played by the property in the Royal affair that provoked a constitutional crisis.

Seok, who is downsizing, said: ‘When we bought the house more than 30 years ago, it was dilapidated and was three separate flats.

We restored it into a proper family home. But I remember, when the building work was going on, that a couple walked by and told me Wallis and Ernest Simpson once lived here.

‘We knew the Furnesses lived here, and so we can only assume that at some point the Furnesses let the Simpsons use one of the apartments.

‘Maybe the Simpsons were looking for a base in London, or perhaps they were between addresses, but the lady had a definite memory that they actually lived here at 48 Elsworthy Road.

She even remembered seeing the Prince turning up at the house in his Bentley.’

Thelma – pronounced the Spanish way: Telma – married the Viscount in 1926. It was a second marriage for each of them.

Thelma and the Prince of Wales grew close in 1930 when they went on safari in east Africa.

The Prince first met the Simpsons in January 1931, at Burrough Court. The couple had been invited to join a weekend house party to act as chaperone to Thelma, whose husband was away.

Thelma then became the Prince’s 
regular companion at his home, Fort Belvedere in Sunningdale, Berkshire,
where the Simpsons were also regular weekend guests.

The affair continued until 1934, 
when Thelma decided to spend three months in New York. Before sailing, 
she took Wallis to The Ritz for lunch and asked her to ‘look after’ the 
Prince while she was away.

The Simpsons were then living in Bryanston Court, near Marble Arch, where they held daily cocktail parties. The Prince became a regular guest, often staying for dinner and even later.

By the time Thelma returned from New York, she had been ousted by Wallis in the Prince’s affections. The Viscount and Thelma divorced in 1933 but records show that in 1934 he was still paying the rates on the Elsworthy Road house and a rate book for the address reveals that Viscountess Thelma Furness was the occupier.

Local council records also include reference to the house in a book entitled Streets Of Belsize, which states: ‘No 48 has a history; in the early 1930s, it belonged to Viscount Furness, whose wife Thelma had, says the DNB [Dictionary Of National Biography], a “passing affair with the Prince of Wales; he was reputedly a frequent visitor to this house”.’

The Arts and Crafts-style 1903 home has seven bedrooms over three storeys.
