Police say a Denver man accused of killing his wife while hallucinating on marijuana-infused candy asked his seven-year-old son to kill him so 'dad and mom could be together with God.'

That was the testimony of Detective Troy Bisgard who took the stand during a preliminary hearing Friday in the case of Richard Kirk.

Kirk had eaten marijuana-infused candy before the attack, according to search warrants released Thursday, before shooting wife Kristine Kirk.

Police say Richard Kirk asked his son, 7, to kill him so he could join wife Kristine 'with God' shortly after he shot and killed her

Better days: Police said two of the couple's unnamed boys were outside the house waiting when they arrived while the seven-year-old was discovered inside with Richard

Kirk reportedly purchased and ate the candy only hours before the tragic shooting, The Denver Channel reports.

He had also reportedly bought ammunition for his 9mm semiautomatic handgun just hours before eating the candy.

The couple had reportedly been having troubles recently, owing $2,500 to the IRS and having more than $40,000 in credit card debt.

It appears that the gun malfunctioned after Mrs. Kirk was shot, preventing Richard Kirk from firing it again.

Bisgard testified the bullet magazine was not properly seated in the gun handle, keeping the weapon from loading another bullet into the chamber from the magazine following the single shot that allegedly killed Mrs. Kirk.

An unfired bullet was discovered in their son's basement room.

Two of the Kirk's unnamed sons were waiting outside the front door when officers arrived at the scene while Richard Kirk was found with his seven-year-old in the house.

Bisgard also testified that police found an empty vial bearing a label for prescription painkillers. Kirk has a bad back.

The
 Denver Police Department released the warrants as they investigate 
whether the pot may have caused Richard Kirk, 47, to hallucinate 
and kill his wife.

Detectives discovered powerful marijuana edibles in the home along with prescription painkillers

Mrs
 Kirk, 44, called police Monday night, telling dispatchers her husband 
ate marijuna candy and had taken prescription pain pills before he 
started hallucinating and scaring their three young sons.

She told dispatchers he was 'talking about the end of the world, and he wanted her to shoot him,' documents say.

Her
 husband could be heard in the background of the call talking about the 
candy he legally purchased from a Denver dispensary earlier in the 
night, and surveillance footage confirms the statement.

Police 
are also conducting an internal investigating into whether they 
responded quickly enough to Kristine Kirk's call, since she died on the 
line with a dispatcher.

That dispatcher has since been placed on paid leave.

Police have since obtained a receipt, finding that Kirk purchased items 
including a marijuana-lace candy called 'Karma Kandy Orange Ginger'. 
Colorado-based Gaia's Garden Edibles advertises a product with the same 
name on their Facebook page. On Gaia Garden's website, they describe 
their KarmaKandy as 'conviently sized and incredibly delicious'.

'A single bite is enough, even for those with intense medicinal needs,' the company warns.

As Mrs Kirk's 911 call continued, she told the dispatcher that her husband had retrieved a weapon.

'She
 next related that he had the gun and she did not know where to go,' the
 warrants say. A few seconds later, Mrs Kirk could be heard screaming. 
Then there was a single gunshot and the line went quiet.

Richard Kirk's 9mm gun allegedly malfunctioned after he gunned down his wife, preventing him from firing another shot

Police said she was shot about 12 to 13 minutes into the call, which has not yet been released.

A
 detective who interviewed Richard Kirk after the shooting believes the 
man was on drugs due to his speech and inability to focus. He was also 
rambling and quickly confessed to killing his wife.

Investigators are now analyzing Kirk's blood sample to see if he was on any other drugs at the time.

Officials have refused to release Mrs Kirk's 911 call, since there's still an open investigation.

'Any
 time a person dies while communicating with Denver's emergency services
 we examine the circumstances to ensure that the incident was handled 
properly and we look for areas to improve upon,' Sonny Jackson, a 
department spokesman, said in a statement.

In
 a press conference Thursday, Police Chief Robert White elaborated, 
saying: 'This is an ongoing investigation, and I just cannot get into 
anything that would remotely compromise it. Obviously something went 
wrong because somebody lost their life.'

Kirk's
 father, also Richard Kirk, said the family is shocked, as the couple 
had shown no signs of marital distress. He visited the family in January
 and was unaware of any drug use by his son.

'It was a great family,' he said. 'He seemed very happy.'

Kirk said police had not given him any information about how the 911 call was handled.
