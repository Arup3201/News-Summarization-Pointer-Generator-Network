Fernando Alonso upstaged title rivals Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton by posting the quickest lap during the opening practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix. 

Alonso relished the tight confines of the Marina Bay street circuit, setting a time of 1 minute, 49.056 seconds - a tenth of a second ahead of  Hamilton, with third-place Rosberg only two hundredths of a second off the pace of his team-mate and championship rival.

The Red Bull pair of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo finished fourth and fifth on the timesheets, but the former suffered an engine problem at the end of the session and was forced to stop on track.

Rosberg had an issue with a loose wing mirror during the session and had to remove it while he was driving 

Alonso's team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, put in a competitive showing with seventh place, behind Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne, who performed strongly before his car suffered an electronics failure that briefly saw him block the pit exit. 

Jenson Button also had technical difficulties that restricted his running but was eighth fastest, followed by Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat and Force India's Sergio Perez.

The Williams cars were surprisingly uncompetitive. While this twisty circuit was expected to count against a team that thrived on the flowing Belgian and Italian tracks in the previous two races, it was still surprising to see Felipe Massa down in the 13th and Valtteri Bottas in 15th.

Vettel, who has been plagued by reliability issues this season, stopped on track at the end of the session near the pit-lane exit complaining of an engine issue.

Team principal Christian Horner has confirmed Vettel will be lucky to make it back on track for the second session.

Horner said: 'It looks like an engine problem, a sudden loss of engine oil pressure, which usually means something pretty nasty.

'The engine changes on this car take around three and a half hours, so there's a lot of work to do.

'It's going to be tough. The biggest loss is the track time and the long run. Sebastian doesn't seem to have much luck at the moment.'

It was the first session run under the new restrictions on pit-car radio transmissions. While the FIA relented on Friday and delayed until 2015 a ban on radio messages about car performance, they did retain a ban on driver coaching - instructions on braking points, gear selection, car set-up at various points on the circuit, etc.

However old habits die hard, and Rosberg, who suffered with a loose wing mirror early on in the session, and Hamilton were heard asking their team about other drivers' tyres and performance - banned under the new regulations - and received curt replies from the garage.

When Hamilton asked as to the wear rate on rivals' tyres, the radio message in reply was: 'Just carry on with our program and we'll discuss it in the garage.'

The opening 90-minute session was free of any major incident, with all but McLaren's Kevin Magnussen having driven the circuit before and learnt to adjust to its bumpy surface, long and technical layout, and close-in barriers.  

Hamilton appeared in relaxed spirits during the session. He won last time out at the Italian Grand Prix
