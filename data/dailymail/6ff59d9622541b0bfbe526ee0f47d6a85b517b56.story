Samuel Eto'o has hinted that he is spoilt for choice on his next destination after leaving Chelsea as a free agent.

Eto'o's one-year contract with the Premier League side expired on June 30, leaving him free to listen to offers from elsewhere. And it appears he has plenty to choose from.

He tweeted: 'Italy? Spain? France? UK? Turkey? USA?????', before adding: 'But I love USA though...'.

Getting on: Even at 33-years-old, Eto'o has plenty of options available to him

The 33-year-old wouldn't be the first big name to decamp to Major League Soccer at the end of his career. Thierry Henry, Tim Cahill and Jermain Defoe already play for MLS sides while Frank Lampard, David Villa and Kaka have made the move Stateside this summer.

Former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker Eto'o failed to win any silverware during his season at Stamford Bridge but he did score 12 goals including a memorable hat-trick against Manchester United in January.

His spell at Chelsea is perhaps most notable for criticism from Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese coach was caught on camera claiming Eto'o was 35-years-old rather than his actual age, which was 32 at the time.

Eto'o had the last laugh though, holding his back and mimicking an old man using a walking stick after scoring in Chelsea's 4-0 win against Tottenham.
