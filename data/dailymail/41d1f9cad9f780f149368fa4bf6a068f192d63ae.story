A New York City woman thinks she is owed a whopping $15 million after a botched hair-implant procedure at a Manhattan hair clinic left her permanently bald.

Deborah Betesh, 56, is suing the firm Microdot after she claims she paid the company $250,000 for the miracle hair transplant procedure. 

Between April 2012 and April 2014, Betesh claims she underwent treatments with Microdot after she began worrying about her hair thinning out.

Wigged out: Deborah Betesh claims a botched hair-implant procedure left her completely bald

Bald: Betesh claims that after the procedure ruined her hair, the firm convinced her to spend thousands on a 'permanent artificial wig'

The company, she claims, promised to give her 'the hair of her dreams' and that the Microdot procedure is 'a safe and effective alternative to having hair transplant surgery,' according to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.

'Not only would Microdot technique exactly match the color and texture of
 her natural hair, it would allow her to among other things, wash her 
hair, use a curling iron or even put it in a ponytail,' the company 
pledged to Betesh, according to court documents obtained by the New York Post.

However, the procedure - which includes surgically implanting hair into a person's scalp - didn't restore her thinning hair. Rather, it left her with bald patches all over her scalp.

Betesh claims a Microdot staffer tried to weave additional hair into the strands that hadn't already fallen out, but that procedure failed, as well.

Betesh claims the Microdot employee who performed the medical procedure on her had no medical license, just a cosmetology license.

Sour grapes: Microdot claims Betesh never had the procedure done and she is just disgruntled about a failed business arrangement she'd made with the firm's founder

After the implants failed, Betesh says the firm convinced her to buy a 'permanent artificial wig for several thousands of dollars.'

Microdot, however, says Betesh's claims are the product of sour grapes, not a botched procedure.

Karen Decileo, a rep for the firm, says Betesh has a hair-pulling disorder and that she only paid $4,800 for a non-surgical treatment similar to getting hair extensions.

Decileo told the Post that Betesh is 'disgruntled' over a business-deal-gone-wrong that she had with Microdot founder James Costa.

She says the $250,000 Betesh paid was an investment in Costa's other alternative medical technique, Derma-Dot.

However, Costa recently was diagnosed with a heart condition and the new venture went by the wayside, causing Betesh to become 'annoyed that [Derma-Dot] wasn’t going forward and she wanted out,' Decileo says.

According to the Post, Microdot doesn't exactly have a great track record when it comes to satisfied customers - over the past three years, there have been 10 complaints made to the Better Business Bureau about Microdot for 'problems with product/service. 

A different rep for the company told the paper that Microdot has 'roughly 2,500 clients a year in each location, making a total of 5,000. 
So having 10 complaints in the past three years isn’t a bad percentage 
at all.'
