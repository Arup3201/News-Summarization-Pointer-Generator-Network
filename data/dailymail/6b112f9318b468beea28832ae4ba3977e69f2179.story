Dressed casually in jeans and baseball caps and carrying their luggage over their shoulders, a young couple slip through King’s Cross Station after a break in country.

This was the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge passing almost unnoticed among the rush-hour crowds as they returned to London on Friday with their cocker spaniel, Lupo.

The only noticeable thing about the couple, who were without 13-month-old Prince George, was the entourage of protection officers accompanying them following their stay at their country home in Norfolk.

The duke and duchess, both 32, had travelled on the scheduled train from King’s Lynn – a trip also made frequently by the Queen to keep costs down.

The couple and Lupo were collected by a waiting people carrier after leaving the train.

They had been staying at Anmer Hall, their home on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where they will be spending more time when Prince William starts his new job as a pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance.

They have been in Norfolk for the past fortnight, overseeing the final stages of a £1.5million refurbishment of the hall. Work has included a new kitchen and rerouting of the driveway to improve privacy.
