Appeals against parking tickets on private land have soared 12-fold in just two years to more than 600 a week, an official watchdog has revealed.

The Parking on Private Land Appeals service (POPLA) deals with contested tickets from car parks in places such as supermarkets, service stations and sports centres.

The service assessed 23,500 appeals in the year ending March 2014, and decided to quash more than 10,000 tickets.

People tended to complain after receiving an invalid ticket, or buying the right ticket but being accused of not properly displaying it on their windscreens

The British Parking Association welcomed the findings, but warned that motorists are still at the mercy of firms who are able to exploit legal loopholes to charge inflated prices for parking

However they upheld around 55 per cent of the tickets, rejecting a total of 12,839 appeal cases over the course of the year.

POPLA was established in October 2012 to hear appeals against parking charge notices which have been issued on private land in England and Wales.

The organisation mirrors the work of the Parking and Traffic Appeals Service, which hears complaints from motorists issued with parking penalties on public roads.

POPLA’s 2014 annual report said there had been a ‘sudden growth’ in penalty charge notice appeals. It revealed that they are now dealing with more than 600 appeals a week – with a total of 25,214 registered in 2013-2014.

The report said one of the main reasons people contested their parking tickets was when they felt that car park signs were ‘unclear, missing or confusing’.

And people also tended to complain after receiving an invalid ticket, or buying the right ticket but being accused of not properly displaying it on their windscreens.

POPLA spokesman Henry Michael Greenslade said: ‘Since my last report the number of cases being decided has grown substantially. The workload has increased some 12-fold. This sudden growth brought its own challenges.’

He added: ‘We are now receiving 600 or more appeals each week, and this number is currently increasing.

‘We are probably receiving as many appeals as, if not more, as the Road User Charging Appeals Tribunal, the England and Wales Traffic Penalty Tribunal, the Scottish Parking Appeals Service and the Northern Ireland Traffic Penalty Tribunal combined.’

The AA said the boom in the number of appeals lodged with POPLA proved that parking regulations on private property had descended into a ‘lottery’.

AA spokesman Paul Watters called for the Government to regulate the private parking industry, and said loopholes which allow ‘rogue’ firms to overcharge motorists should be dealt with. 

Speaking about the number of appeals that were rejected, he said: ‘It is a bit disappointing that 55 per cent were refused. Drivers will feel slightly grudging about that.’

He added: ‘Motorists still feel the lack of regulation means that it is a lottery. The Government needs to do more to regulate it. 

‘Operators are going overboard on number plate recognition cameras and heavy-handed ticketing. I hope the appeal system is leading them to pull their socks up. The writing is on the wall for operators that blitz tickets.’ 

The British Parking Association welcomed the POPLA findings, but warned that motorists are still at the mercy of firms who are  able to exploit legal loopholes to charge inflated prices for parking.
