Peter Ebdon survived a scare in the first round of the UK Championship as he had to fight back to beat Ross Muir 6-5 in York.

The Scotsman raced out into a 2-0 lead, aided by a break of 85 in the second frame but, after claiming a scrappy third, the 2002 world champion registered a 73 in the next to level things up.

The two men then exchanged frames until the contest got to 5-5 and Ebdon edged a decider to move into the second round.
