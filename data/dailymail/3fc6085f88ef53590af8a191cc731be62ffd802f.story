Coles will pay $11.25million in fines and costs but could end up paying more than double that in refunds to suppliers, after a court agreed to the supermarket giant's settlement with the competition watchdog.

Federal Court judge Michelle Gordon said Coles had engaged in illegal and unconscionable conduct in its dealings with suppliers, including demanding payments to which it was not entitled to fill its own profit gaps and threatening commercial consequences.  

Justice Gordon suggested last week the settlement with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) did not involve severe enough penalties but ultimately accepted it, saying on Monday she had taken Coles's admission of wrongdoing into account.

Coles engaged in illegal and unconscionable conduct in its dealings with suppliers, a court has ruled

The $10 million in fines applies to Coles' treatment of suppliers involving 15 instances and eight suppliers in which it breached consumer law.

It threatened commercial consequences including not granting future contracts or promotion of products if it did not pay rebates to Coles to fund a supply chain improvement program or fill profit gaps.

In the case of cleaning brand Oates, Coles calculated that its profit from selling Oates products was $326,590 less than the supermarket expected.

Coles ordered Oates to repay this amount but refused to explain its calculations. When Oates refused, Coles deducted $246,400 from a payment it owed the company.

Oates told Coles this payment was unacceptable and unauthorised, but offered to make monthly payments to repay of $365,200 'to address the Oates purported profit gap' and in exchange for Coles providing Oates with a number of catalogue spots and product trials.

Coles accepted the offer despite knowing it had no entitlement to the money.

Coles eventually returned the $246,400 that it had withheld from Oates without authority or agreement.

More than 200 suppliers will now potentially be able to seek refunds from Coles over extra payments that were demanded to fill in gaps in profit, related to Coles squeezing suppliers when it felt it had not made enough of a profit on products for various reasons such as poor sales, discounts or waste.

Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett will be the independent arbiter who decided whether suppliers should be refunded by Coles.

In her judgement, Federal Court judge Michelle Gordon said Coles misused its bargaining power.

'Coles demanded payments from suppliers to which it was not entitled by threatening harm to the suppliers that did not comply with the demand,' Justice Gordon said.

'Coles withheld money from suppliers it had no right to withhold.

'Coles' practices, demands and threats were deliberate, orchestrated and relentless.'

The ACCC's court documents released earlier this year included evidence of internal emails from Coles executives detailing an annual 'profit day', in which staff were pushed to squeeze suppliers for payments to fund profit gaps.

Coles Managing Director John Durkan said the company 'unconditionally apologises and accepts full responsibility for its actions'

ACCC chairman Rod Sims described Coles' conduct as unconscionable, a misuse of market power and unfair profit shifting from suppliers to Coles when the second of two legal cases was brought in October.

Coles is the second largest retailer of grocery products in Australia.

She noted that Coles now admits that its conduct was contrary to law and involved serious breaches.

Coles Managing Director John Durkan repeated last week's apology.

He said the company 'unconditionally apologises and accepts full responsibility for its actions in these supplier dealings.

'Coles crossed the line in the supplier dealings in 2011 subject to these proceedings and regrettably treated these suppliers in a manner inconsistent with acceptable business practice.'

'Since these incidents occurred in 2011, Coles has taken many steps to both improve its relationships with suppliers and help its suppliers grow,' he said.
