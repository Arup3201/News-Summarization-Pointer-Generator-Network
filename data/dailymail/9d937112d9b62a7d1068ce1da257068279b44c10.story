A comedian well-known for poking fun at Al-Qaeda linked Shebab insurgents has been shot dead in Somalia.

Abdi Jeylani Malaq Marshale, thought to have been 43, was killed in Mogadishu late last night.

He was targeted minutes after leaving Kulmiye radio station, where he worked as drama producer and performer.

Funnyman: Abdi Jeylani Malaq Marshale, thought to have been 43, was killed in Mogadishu, Somalia, late last night

'Two men shot and seriously injured 
Marshale... the comedian was later pronounced dead,' said police 
lieutenant Mohamed Gaal, adding that 'unfortunately the assailants 
escaped'.

The shooting of 
Marshale, who also worked for the London-based Universal TV station and 
who reported having received death threats on several occasions, is the 
latest in a string of apparently targeted killings against media 
workers.

Colleagues mourned
the loss of a man they called a leader of the war-torn nation's comedy 
scene. His shows have aired on Universal TV and are also available on 
YouTube.

Yusuf Keynan, a presenter at Kulmiye radio, said: 'He had not done anything wrong to anybody, as far as we are concerned, but they shot him in the head and shoulders.

'This
is a black day for the entire entertainment industry, he was a leader 
in Somali comedy and everybody liked his performances.'

Marshale
was known for airing dramas making fun of the extremist Shebab and for 
participating in youth advocacy programmes aimed at preventing young 
Somalis from joining the insurgents.

So far this year, at least one Somali journalist has been targeted and killed each month.
