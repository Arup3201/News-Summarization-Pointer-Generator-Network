Taxi drivers have proposed ten new road signs for Britain’s cities - including warnings about potholes, rickshaws and school run congestion zones.

They have also identified ten senseless signs they say should be scrapped such as warnings about horse-drawn vehicles and migratory toads on roads.

And Highway Code updates that cabbies suggest include bans on texting, wearing killer heels and relying on Google Maps while driving.

Warning: London taxi drivers have proposed ten new road signs for Britain's cities - including warnings about potholes, rickshaws and school run congestion zones

Distraction: The drivers questioned said they want road signs put in place to warn them of pedestrians texting while crossing the road

Nearly 600 London black cab drivers - famous for their forthright views - were asked about new ways of improving road safety.

An overwhelming 79 per cent wanted the minimum driving age upped to 18 and more than half, 56 per cent, think new drivers should face a night time curfew.

Nearly three quarters, 73 per cent, think elderly drivers should have to re-sit their test at the age of 70, while 55 per cent want jaywalking, or wreckless road crossing by pedestrians, made illegal in the UK, as it is in the US.

Hazard: Taxi drivers said that pedestrians should remove their headphones before crossing the road

Suggestions: The cabbies put forward 10 new road signs, including warnings about bicycles, middle-aged men in Lycra and congestion outside schools

When it comes to new road signs, six in ten want one warning of ‘Craters Ahead’ to be put on badly potholed roads, while more than half, 52 per cent, would like to see a warning of ‘Rickshaws clogging up road’ in areas like London’s West End where they slow down traffic.

And middle-aged men in Lycra fell foul of 24 per cent of the questioned cabbies, who declared the cyclists to be such a menace that they required a dedicated warning sign.

After a spate of deaths of cyclists on 
London’s roads, 36 per cent want to see a ‘Bicycles turning’ warning 
sign introduced, while around a third suggested that warnings about 
pedestrians wearing headphones could be introduced.

Other suggestions included warnings about congestion near schools, a 'Caution Tourist Area' sign, and a sign to encourage mobile users to pay more attention to traffic.

Unnecessary: The drivers also wanted to see the back of outdated signs, including warnings of horse drawn vehicles in the road

The final proposal from 21 per cent is that there should be a single, consistent design - a red circle with a red slash through the picture - when something is outlawed, and to avoid confusion, they said that the current alternative ‘No’ design - a red circle containing a picture - should be scrapped.

Taxi drivers said they also wanted to ditched the 'horse drawn vehicles likely to be on the road’ as they believe it is outdated, and 57 per cent want to do away with ‘migratory toad crossing’, as they cabbies think stopping for toads would cause accidents.

They survey, carried out by black cab app Hailo, also asked drivers how they would like to update the Highway Code, with 72 per cent calling for a ban on texting or social media updates while driving, and 58 per cent asking for an instruction not to stop when pulled over by police until it is safe to do so.

Congestion: The drivers complained that tourists and rickshaws both caused traffic hold-ups

Driving in heels over three inches in height should be banned, according to 44 per cent, and 38 per cent want to see driving barefoot outlawed.

A warning against relying on Google Maps as a satellite navigation tool is proposed by 36 per cent.Safety suggestions cabbies have for pedestrians include avoiding using their mobiles while crossing roads (cited by 75 per cent), always getting out of cars curb-side (63 per cent) and removing headphones before crossing roads (63 per cent).

Hailo founder Russell Hall said: 'Cabbies have their fingers on the pulse when it comes to road safety - they are an authority on city streets.

The knowledge: Russell Hall, founder of black cab app Hailo, said taxi drivers had been asked for their views on road safety because they are an authority on city streets

'It’s important that we stop and take the time to reassess road safety and what works for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike to ensure we move with the times.

'The new road signs address modern day life.

'Potholes are a common gripe of all drivers and something to be wary of on UK roads.

'Similarly, much more attention needs to be paid to cyclists on the road.

'Lifestyles play a huge part too from the school run drop off to the increased number of people carrying technology such as headphones and mobiles these days.'
