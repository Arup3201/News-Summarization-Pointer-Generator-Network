Standing at the centre of a crowd, wearing a skull-cap and holding a mobile phone, this is Michael Adebolajo on the anniversary of 9/11 in 2009.

He was among hundreds of young Muslims who gathered outside Harrow Central Mosque in North-West London, to 'defend' it against a planned joint protest by the English Defence League and Stop the Islamisation of Europe group.

Even though that event was called off – and despite the mosque's pleas for peace from the Muslim youths – they vented their anger on the police instead.

Officers were pelted with bricks, bottles and fireworks. There were ten arrests.
