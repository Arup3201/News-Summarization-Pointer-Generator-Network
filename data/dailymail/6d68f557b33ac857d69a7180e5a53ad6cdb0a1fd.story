Big-race jockey issues for trainer Alan King have been allayed this weekend at least with news that Denis O’Regan will be on board Medermit should he take his chance in the Betfair Chase at Haydock on Saturday.

King, still awaiting the return of long-time ally Robert Thornton, is now sweating over the immediate future of his other main rider Wayne Hutchinson, who will have a scan on a knee he injured at Doncaster on Tuesday.

Hutchinson missed three rides at Warwick yesterday, including the King-trained winner Lady Persephone who landed the Bumper under in-form substitute Richard Johnson.

Hutchinson rode Medermit on his seasonal debut when fourth to Menorah in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby.

But King confirmed the 10-year-old’s owners, The Dunkley & Reilly Partnership, have struck a deal for O’Regan to ride the three horses in his stable – the other two being promising novice chaser Ned Stark and The Pirate’s Queen, who won at Doncaster on Tuesday.

King said: ‘Denis will ride Medermit if he runs on Saturday. He has an agreement with the owners. Wayne is having a scan on his knee and we are waiting for the result.’

Should Hutchinson, who has a history of knee problems, also face a period on the sidelines King will have to line up new jockeys for his two Hennessy Gold Cup hopes – Smad Place and Midnight Prayer – at Newbury a week on Saturday.

Smad Place, a 10-1 shot and runner-up in the RSA Chase in March, has never been ridden by anyone other than Hutchinson and Thornton since he arrived from France in 2010.

Trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, who runs Champion Hurdle hope The New One in Betfair Price Rush Hurdle at Haydock on Saturday, intends running Charlie Hall Chase third Double Ross in the Betfair Chase.

Jockey son Sam will be back on board. He is available because Noel Fehily has an agreement to retain the ride on his Paul Nicholls-trained King George VI Chase winner Silviniaco Conti.

Nicholls and Twiston-Davies combined for a bloodless 12-length success with Ptit Zig in the Highflyer/Million In Mind Novices’ Chase at Warwick.

It was a second chase win for the grade-one winning hurdler, who was sixth in this year’s Champion Hurdle. He could now be stepped up in class with a target at Ascot’s pre-Christmas meeting.

Nicholls said: ‘He hasn’t been the most natural jumper and we have had to do a lot of work schooling him. I was keen to get some experience into him before we step him up and that was great.’

The firm quote Mullins’ unbeaten hurdler at Faugheen at 1-3 for the race they sponsor at Ascot on Saturday. One rival he is likely to face is Paul Nicholls-trained Lac Fontana, a grade one winning novice last season.
