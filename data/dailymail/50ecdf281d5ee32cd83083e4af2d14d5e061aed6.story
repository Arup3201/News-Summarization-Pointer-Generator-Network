A 10-year-old girl received an early Christmas present on Tuesday when President Obama signed her journal while vacationing in Hawaii.

The president was enjoying his morning workout at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay when he encountered Kyrstin Lavelle from Toronto, who boldly asked for his autograph.

Obama duly obliged, writing in the little girl’s journal, ‘To Kyrstin - Dream big dreams!’ along with his signature.

The president was spotted on the golf course at the Mid Pacific Country Club in Lanikai on Monday 

Kyrstin described the president as ‘really nice,’ and said she also gave him some flowers.

Obama said that he would give the flowers to the first lady and joked that he would claim to have picked them himself, reports ABC News.

At the gym, president Obama was spotted working out with free weights and shooting baskets before heading back to the first family's vacation home.

The Obamas landed in Hawaii at the weekend and the president has already been spotted twice on the golf course.

Since arriving in Hawaii at the weekend, the president has been spotted playing golf twice already

On Tuesday he played at the Mid Pacific Country Club in Lanikai, a beachside 
neighborhood in Kailua a few miles from his vacation home.

Between holes he greeted some local residents who were clamoring for his attention.

Those that were out on the course at the same time as the president say the Secret Service with metal detectors checked them at least four times throughout the round.

After golf, Obama joined his family at a beach outing at the Marine base. The president has been enjoying morning workouts at Marine Corps

On Sunday the entire family attended the Oregon State-Akron game as part of the Diamond Head Classic tournament in Honolulu.

Can we go now? President Barack Obama and the vacationing first family skipped the beach in Hawaii on Sunday to take in a college basketball game

The game held particular interest as 
Oregon State is coached by Michelle's brother, Craig Robinson, although 
at times the first lady and the girls didn't look as excited to be 
watching the game as the president did.

The president had every reason to smile as he received a much warmer welcome in his home state than he did the last time he took his family to a basketball game back in November.

Then he had been greeted with boos as the family had sat down to watch Oregon State take on the University of Maryland, but in Hawaii the president is treated very much like a returning hero. 

The Obamas drew a standing ovation and loud cheers as they walked in to the small arena at the University of Hawaii.

Fans took pictures while press photographers and videographers crowded an entrance to take pictures. Throughout the game, some fans ignored the action on the floor and watched the president instead.

The arena beefed up security because of the president, screening players and cheerleaders and their belongings with metal detectors in the hours before the tournament tipped off.

In the past President Obama, a noted basketball fan and recreational player, has been something of a lucky charm for his brother-in-law’s team. Before Sunday he had seen them win 4-0, although on Sunday Akon beat Oregon 83:71.

Every year, Obama and his family return to his birth state on the sun-scorched shores of Oahu. And every year - until now - congressional squabbling has forced the Obamas to delay their trip or cut it short.

This year, Obama was cleared for an on-time departure by Congress, which defied pessimistic expectations last week by passing a bipartisan budget deal, all but ensuring the government won't shut down over the next two years.

Holiday starts now: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama disembark Air Force One after arriving at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for their family Christmas vacation on Friday, Dec. 20, 2013, in Honolulu

It was a far cry from presaging a new 
era of cooperation, to be sure, but a silver lining for Obama a day 
earlier as he acknowledged a year of frustrating 'ups and downs' in an 
end-of-year news conference.

The president, first lady Michelle 
Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia, and first dogs Sunny and Bo hopped an 
overnight flight on Friday aboard Air Force One to Honolulu, where they 
were whisked by motorcade to a beachside home in Kailua, a sleepy suburb
 with a five-mile stretch of beach popular among windsurfers and 
tourists.

The next 
morning Obama, typically an early riser, got a late start, staying at 
the home until early afternoon, when he headed to the golf course at a 
nearby Marine Corps base.

Joining Obama for the round of golf were Sam 
Kass, the White House chef; Marvin Nicholson, Obama's trip director; and his friend Titcomb, the White House said.

Obama,
 in white golf shirt, hat and sunglasses, was all smiles as he drove 
past reporters accompanying him to the coastal golf course.

Merry Christmas: US President Barack Obama greets soldiers upon arriving at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Honolulu, Hawaii

The president has no public events scheduled during his vacation, which is expected to last through January 5.

In previous years, frequent golf outings have accompanied trips to local restaurants and other island outings.

A few weeks of low-key rest and relaxation would be a welcome change of pace for Obama, who reflected on a high-stakes year of brinkmanship and health care woes as he packed his bags for Hawaii.

'The end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Obama said Friday. 'I'm sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.'

Last year, Obama had to temporarily abandon his vacation to fly home amid a congressional standoff over the so-called fiscal cliff.

The year before, a showdown over payroll tax cuts forced him to delay the start of his Hawaii hiatus.

In 2010, it was congressional wrangling over repeal of the ban on gays in the military and other issues that delayed the trip. And in 2009, Senate deliberations over Obama's signature health care law meant that Honolulu had to wait another few days.

Conditions seem ripe this year for a few weeks of interrupted family time.

The first family are spending their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii which will cost taxpayers $100,000
