Kevin Ward Jr's family found out that he had died on Facebook, his devastated father has revealed.

Speaking out for the first time since his 20-year-old son died after being hit by NASCAR champion Tony Stewart on Saturday night, Kevin Ward Sr. said his daughter learned of the heartbreaking news online and broke it to him over the phone as they waited for updates in the hospital.

'He was just a very God-gifted kid,' Ward Sr. told Syracuse.com of his son. 'I think he slept with a smile on his face.'

Mr Ward expressed his anger at Stewart, saying only he knows the truth of what happened on the track at the Canadaigua Motorsports Park on Saturday night.

Heartbroken: Kevin Ward Sr., pictured with his wife Pam and their son Kevin Ward Jr., learned that the young man had died over Facebook. They were at the race where he died but did not see him get hit

'The one person that knows what happened 
that night is possibly facing 10 years in prison. Is he going to say 
what he done?' Mr Ward said.

He was at the Canadaigua Motorsports Park with his wife Pamela when their son got into a crash on lap 14 of a 25-lap Empire Super Sprint race.

A video of the incident apparently shows Stewart's car apparently making contact with Ward's car before the younger driver's vehicle spins out and comes to a stop near a wall.

Ward can then be seen getting out of his crashed car and walking towards other cars on the track before pointing a finger, apparently at Stewart.

A car 
swerves to avoid him, but when Stewart's car passes close to Ward, his 
right rear tire apparently hits him, and Ward was pulled beneath the car
 and thrown in the air.

Mr
 Ward said it was the first time his son had ever climbed out of his car
 during a race, and believes he reacted that way is because of 'who put 
him into the wall'.

Questions: Mr Ward said that all the other drivers managed to see his son walking on the track on Saturday night but for some reason, NASCAR star Tony Stewart (pictured) failed to see him

Proud: The devastated parents said they do not want their son to be remembered for his death

'Tony Stewart was the best damn driver by
 far on the track that night,' he said. 'Why he had to go up as high as he did and 
hog my son, there's no reason for it.'

He said that all the other drivers on the track saw the young man walking - but Stewart still hit him.

'Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,' he said.

But Mr Ward did not see his son get hit because he was riding a four-wheeler over to where the car had crashed. As he headed over there, someone told him Kevin had been hit.

The couple 
watched for 45 minutes as emergency workers performed CPR and traveled 
with their son to the hospital. There, they received the call from their
 daughter.

Kevin Ward Jr will be remembered at a funeral service on Thursday.

Ontario
 County sheriff's deputies, who have met twice with the Ward family, are
 still investigating the crash and are looking at another video of the 
incident.

Confrontation: Ward Jr was hit after he was nudged off the course and walked on the track, pointing his finger angrily at Stewart. Stewart's car then fatally hit him when it came around the track

Sheriff Philip Povero has said that his 
initial findings have turned up nothing that would indicate criminal 
intent in the crash - but legal experts agree that does not mean Stewart
 is in the clear.

He could be charged with second-degree manslaughter under New York law if prosecutors believe he 'recklessly caused the death of another person,' with negligent homicide another possibility, criminal law professor Corey Rayburn Yung of the Kansas University School of Law told the Associated Press.

'The question over whether someone was reckless is a factual one, and one a prosecutor might let a jury decide,' said Yung, who also posts at the Concurring Opinion blog.

Stewart would not expect to be charged for the car-on-car bump that sent Ward spinning into the wall. But if, for example, he were to tell police he saw Ward on the track and tried to shower him with dirt or send him a message, a first-degree manslaughter charge could be a possibility, Yung said.

In a 1949 
case that Yung uses in his class, midget car racer Joseph Sostilio was 
found guilty of manslaughter after he tried to squeeze a four foot-wide 
vehicle through a two-foot opening at 40 mph, crashing into another car 
and sending it into the one driven by Stephen D. Bishop. Bishop's car 
flipped three times and he was killed.

Missed: A makeshift memorial can be seen for Kevin Ward, Jr. at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in New York, where he was fatally hit on August 9. Ward Jr will be remembered at a funeral on Thursday

Sostilio's conviction was upheld on appeal by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

Noting that a violent or aggressive act on a football field or in a boxing ring is not necessarily a crime, Justice Henry Tilton Lummus wrote: 'In the present case physical contact was not an essential part of the racing of automobiles.'

Povero would not say how Stewart described the accident, but he said he has reviewed two videos and spoken to Stewart. There is no video or audio from Stewart's vehicle.

'The worst thing that could happen for Stewart is if his story doesn't seem to match other evidence,' Yung said. 'Because then it might call into question his own story.'

After the investigation is completed, Povero said, the evidence will be turned over to the district attorney. Even if he is cleared by prosecutors, though, Stewart could face a civil suit.
