Joy: Mary Portas and partner Melanie Rickey had their child, Horatio, six months ago

High street guru Mary Portas has spoken of her joy after she became a mother for the third time, aged 52.

The Government's Queen of the Shops announced civil partner Melanie Rickey, a journalist, gave birth to Horatio six months ago after he was conceived via IVF with an anonymous donor.

Ms Portas, who already has two teenage children, Verity and Mylo, from her first marriage, said: 'It's wonderful. I'd forgotten how much laughter there is — even at 5.45 in the morning when you feel like death.

'Going in to pick up a child is one of the most special things in the world.'

The business champion said she felt more confident being a mother the third time around.

'I don't think you get as stressed when you're older,' she said. 'I kind of know what I'm doing more.'

In a wide-ranging interview with the Daily Mail, the star spoke about how her own upbringing has shaped her parental ethos.

'I had an extraordinarily strong mother,' she said. 'The fundamentals of parenting are about love, structure, and knowing where you are in the world.

'I had that. I liken it to being out on the sea and knowing you have to get to land.'

Ms
Portas runs a brand-management company and writes a weekly magazine 
column, which inspired the BBC television series, Mary Queen of Shops.

She
was also commissioned by the Government to lead a review of Britain's 
high streets, but she said: 'Of all the things I have done, being a 
mother is the most important, and the one I'm most proud of.'

Ms Portas divorced from husband Graham in 2003 and entered into a civil partnership with Ms Rickey in 2010, whom she met at a Royal College of Art dinner.

After combining retail with the world of TV in 2007 with reality series Mary Queen Of Shops, Secret Shopper and Mary's Bottom Line, she took what even she says was a 'slightly crazy' swerve two years ago by accepting an invitation from the Government to write recommendations on how to revive high streets, which resulted in the Portas Review and a pilot programme for change.

Communities up and down the country were invited to become Portas Pilots by applying for grants for regeneration, and Ms Portas has off her own back visited many to see how they are implementing the ideas.

In all, £1.2 million has been made available, with 12 towns benefiting from big pay-outs and nearly 400 more being offered advice.

Guru: Prime Minister David Cameron has tapped into Ms Portas' knowledge of the High Street to try and reinvigorate town centres
