Frustrated villagers fed up with drivers careering through a dangerous ford have put up a blunt sign warning ‘idiots with twattnavs, meet thy doom’.

Those behind the unofficial tin sign say impatient drivers regularly ignore warning notices and instead follow their Sat Nav directions through the ford – even when it is several feet high with water.

They came up with the unique deterrent following numerous vehicle rescues.

Hampshire Country Council is considering closing the ford in Headly because of the danger caused by drivers who refuse to turn back down the narrow country lane and risk crossing the water.

Simon Hiscock, who owns a smallholding nearby has had to rescue dozens of motorists from the ford through the River Enborne, where closure signs regularly disappear.

He said: ‘There are big red signs saying road closed and there are barriers, but people are driving through it.

‘People are leaving the plastic barriers flat in the road and driving across them.’

He said villagers had seen several motorists driving through the ford recently, even when the river was several feet higher than usual following heavy rain.

‘There were two people's cars stuck in the ford last week’ he added.

The ford, which straddles the Hampshire-Berkshire border in Thornford Road, was closed in April after a man died while trying to drive through the ford.

It is due to remain shut for 18 months - and might even be sealed off permanently, the county council has said.

The ford has been the site of numerous rescues in the past. Floods can cause the river - normally just a few inches deep - to rise to more than six feet.

Headley parish council chairman Barrie Hiscock said the ideal option would be to ‘completely seal it off for all time’, but conceded that it might pose problems for local farmers who rely on it to get tractors and heavy machinery to their fields.

Problems have been made worse by roadworks on the busy A339 Newbury to Basingstoke road, which has led to impatient drivers using the lane where the ford is located as a rat run to get round the congestion.

A Hampshire county council spokesman said they plan to install larger barriers.

He added: ‘Although the local highways team inspect the barriers at the ford regularly they cannot monitor them 24 hours a day.

‘We recognise that the closure will cause some people inconvenience by having to drive around the traffic diversion routes, but it is important to maintain the safety of the travelling public.’

Paul Coates, of Hampshire Fire and Rescue, said: ‘These fords we class as very dangerous because of the force of the water...six inches of water can lift a car.

‘Even if you get your car through the water can damage your engine, you're potentially going to get a big bill and the insurance company won't pay it. Don't go through it, turn around.’
