Google is set to take on Apple head on with a new big screen tablet and music service revealed today.

The firm had originally planned to reveal the Nexus 10 tablet at an event in New York, but was forced to cancel due to hurricane Sandy, so took the industry by surprise and simply revealed the products online.

The larger Nexus 10 tablet is being made by Samsung and 
features a display screen that measures about 10 inches diagonally, slightly larger than Apple's 9.7inch iPad.

The new Nexus 10 tablet, which was announced by Google today and will take on the full sized iPad

The Nexus 10 will retail for £319 for the 16GB version and £389 for the 
32GB version

The smaller Nexus 7 tablet has also been updated to 
include 3G connectivity on the 32GB version for £239.

The Nexus 4 phone 
will retail for £239 for an 8GB version or £279 for a 16GB version.

Google claims the tablet features what it claims is the highest resolution display in the world, with 300 pixels per inch compared to the iPad’s 264ppi ‘retina display’.

The £319 device will go on sale in November, and will also be the first device to feature Google’s new ‘Play Music Service’.

The service will allow users to synchronise up to 20,000 tracks they already own with any internet-connected device as well as buy tracks online in the same way that they can from iTunes.

Google also announced the Nexus 4 mobile phone, made with LG, features a 4.7” screen, wireless charging and an enhanced camera that allows users to create immersive panoramas covering all the angles they can see, in the same manner as Google’s Streetview technology.

The ‘Photosphere’ technology is part of the Android 4.2 software upgrade also announced today.

The Nexus 4 handset, which Google hopes will take on the iPad

Google said it hoped the new range would help people who own multiple devices.

'People increasingly have more than one device, and they switch between them many times a day.

'Nexus—Google’s hardware line for Android devices—gets rid of the hassle.

'Just sign in with your Google Account and everything is there ready to go, whatever device you’re using: photos, emails, contacts, bookmarks, even your entertainment on Google Play.'

Besides adding more hardware to its online store, Google is expanding its music library to include Warner Music Group's catalog.

Warner had been the only holdout among the major music labels when Google began selling music a year ago to compete with Apple's iTunes stores.

The company also said it will begin selling music in Europe for the first time beginning Nov. 13.

The Android update includes a feature called Gesture Typing, which is supposed to make it quicker and simpler to enter text and other information on touch-screen phones and tablets.
