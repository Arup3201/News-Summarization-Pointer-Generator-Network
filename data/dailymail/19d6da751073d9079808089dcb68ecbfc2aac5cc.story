Angel Di Maria has revealed that Paris Saint-Germain's well-documented financial issues prevented him moving to France rather than Manchester United last summer.

The French giants were issued with a spending restriction last summer for breaching UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations with Di Maria subsequently making the move to Old Trafford for a British transfer record of £59.7 million.

And the Argentine believes PSG’s money troubles were the key reason why they halted their pursuit.

‘PSG, I think they had a money problem and they couldn’t buy players,' Di Maria said in an interview with French broadcaster Telefoot. 'This is the main reason I didn’t go there. Playing in the French league would please a lot of players.

'Now I’m in the English league. But you never know, there is a lot of movements in football. You can never predict where you’re going to play.

'There were a lot of clubs interested in me. A lot really. But Manchester United appeared and didn’t go away. They absolutely wanted me and it happened.”

Di Maria has made an impressive start to his career in the Premier League but the former Los Blancos star refused to ruled out a move to the Ligue 1 side later in his career.

'It could have been a good experience for me to go to Paris,' he added. 'I know I’m still young, perhaps I’ll go to PSG one day. I don’t know how it will all end.'

Di Maria insisted he had no regrets leaving the Bernabeu in the summer despite United’s on-field struggles this season.

‘It’s a different style of football here at Manchester United,' he stated. 'I’m very happy. I don’t have regrets about leaving Real Madrid. I think I won everything I wanted with Real: La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa Del Rey.'
