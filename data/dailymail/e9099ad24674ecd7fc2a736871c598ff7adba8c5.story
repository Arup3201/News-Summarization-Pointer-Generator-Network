From singing to setting up a best-selling fashion line, it would seem there isn't much Myleene Klass can't turn her hand to.

Now her retail empire is set to expand with the launch of a range of beauty products that she hopes will prove just as popular as previous forays into fashion.

The glamorous new collection consists of seven products that reflect her polished personal style and includes a bronzer, eyeshadows and lipsticks.

Glamorous: Myleene shows off the vintage style that inspired her Littlewood's beauty collection

'I love playing around with different 
make-up looks,' said Myleene. 'With so many women asking me how I 
create my look, I jumped at the chance to create my own line.

'For me, 
it’s all about wearing colours and shades that work well with your skin 
tone.'

The new range, which will be sold at Littlewoods, starts at £15 for a lipgloss trio while the entire collection can be had for £49.

The beauty range is her third collaboration with Littlewoods and with her swimwear and 
clothing collections proving extremely popular, Myleene is now hoping her 50s-inspired beauty range can repeat the trick.

'[I hope] that women love it as much as they love 
the clothing and swimwear range,' she added.

Debut: Myleene has never before designed a beauty collection. 'I love the lippys,' she says

Elegant: According to Myleene, the look is natural but polished by day and 1950s vamp for evening

Classic: Myleene is a big fan of her three signature lip colours, including the pillbox red 'Diva' (above)

'My aim [with fashion] was to create wearable clothes that look fab and make you feel great, and thankfully it seems to be working'

Of her new range, Myleene revealed that she was most excited about the lipsticks, which come in three bright shades.

'I love the lippys,' she said.

'They are bright, bold
and eye-catching plus the packaging looks fantastic on your dresser or 
in your bathroom so would be a shame not to display it.'

The collection includes three signature shades of lipstick, including a bright coral named 'Fearless', a vampy burgundy and a classic pillarbox red, and three vibrant lipglosses.

'It seemed like the most natural 
progression as I am always asked about what make up I wear,' added Myleene.

'I've also 
been extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to work with world 
class make up artists so have learnt some great application tricks.

'I've
hand picked the best, most effective products and put them into a 
capsule collection that contains everything you could wish for in a make
up range.'

Littlewoods retail director, Gary Kibble added: 'Our customers always respond so well to Myleene’s new collections, they really see her as a glamorous yummy mummy, so naturally, the next step was to extend her range to include beauty.'

Elegant: Myleene looked lovely in red as she 
left the ITV summer party yesterday but is more famous for her bikinis -
