Drug: Abiraterone (pictured), a pill that gives at least four months of extra life, is given to patients after chemo, when they are running out of options

The NHS rationing body is refusing to give men with prostate cancer a drug that can delay the need for chemotherapy.

Abiraterone, a pill that gives at least four months of extra life, is given to patients after chemo, when they are running out of options.

But thousands could benefit from taking it earlier, since it has fewer side effects than chemotherapy and improves quality of life.

The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) today says in final draft guidance that it will not approve such use on the NHS.

Campaigners and doctors have condemned the decision, saying it is another example of Nice limiting treatment options for cancer sufferers.

They fear that innovative treatments in the pipeline don’t stand a chance of getting approved under the rationing system, and that promised changes next year will actually worsen the situation.

They also claim it is ‘illogical’ to prevent men being treated with abiraterone earlier in the disease, when the NHS is already picking up the bill for treatment after chemotherapy.

Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK said ‘It’s a fiasco. This decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer.  

‘For many this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which come with it.’

Hugh Gunn, treasurer of the prostate cancer charity Tackle, added: ‘We’re so distraught that NICE keep limiting these life saving drugs for men with no other life lines, with seemingly no evidence to support their decisions.’ 

Doctors at the Institute of Cancer 
Research in London, where the drug was discovered, said the decision 
showed the system operated by Nice was not fit for purpose – the same 
charge made last week when the breast cancer drug Kadcyla was blocked.

In the case of abiraterone, Nice said the drug was too costly to use at an earlier stage in the disease.

When the drug is used after chemotherapy, different rules apply that take into account the end-of-life plight of patients which make the drug cost-effective.

Although the drug is sold to the NHS at the same price at whatever stage in the disease it is used, the cost effectiveness formula becomes more expensive before chemotherapy. 

The official price of a month’s treatment is £3,000 but the NHS pays less through a discount scheme from the manufacturer.

Professor Paul Workman, Interim Chief 
Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: 
‘Abiraterone, which was discovered at The Institute of Cancer Research, 
is now used as standard after chemotherapy, where it was found to be 
cost-effective under NICE’s own end-of-life criteria.

‘It is plainly illogical that NICE did not have the flexibility to assess use of abiraterone before chemotherapy under the same end-of-life criteria, simply because men were here surviving for longer than the two-year cut-off. 

‘It is an unintended, and quite bizarre, consequence of the current rules for appraisals that patients have to wait until their life expectancy drops before they can access beneficial drugs on the NHS.

‘Now men will have to wait until they are in the final stage of their lives before they can access this treatment, and men who are too frail to receive chemotherapy face not being able to receive abiraterone at all.’ 

Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, was used pre-chemotherapy by 3,000 men last year through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill for patients in England when a drug is awaiting approval from Nice. Some Britons have survived on it for almost five years.

Mr Sharp added: ‘The current system is flawed. It is not fit for purpose and it is the very people it is supposed to serve who are bearing the brunt.  

‘This decision is unjust and it needs to be overturned so that men in desperate need can receive the most effective drugs, wherever they live.’ 

Professor Workman said there was mounting concern that British patients would increasingly lose out.

‘We believe that the current Nice system for drug appraisals takes too little account of how innovative a treatment is, and we worry that the new rules under consideration could make this situation even worse,' he said.

‘It is likely that many modern targeted therapies will be more effective in patients when used earlier in treatment or in combinations, but it will be impossible to provide treatment in these ways if innovative drugs first fail to clear the hurdle of Nice approval.’ 

Dr Peter Barnes, Medical Director at Janssen said the company would appeal. 

‘We are very disappointed with this decision which, if it stands, will leave thousands of men in England in the advanced stages of prostate cancer with no option but to accept chemotherapy - which they may not necessarily need or want yet - before being eligible to receive abiraterone routinely on the NHS,' he said.

‘These men will eventually be able to receive abiraterone on the NHS after chemotherapy anyway, but will be denied the option of taking it earlier on in their illness.’ 

In 2012, Nice attempted to ban the use of abiraterone altogether but was forced into a U-turn after a public outcry and a rare intervention from the Department of Health (DH).

In June, former Health Minister Paul Burstow urged the DH to intervene to call off the restriction on pre-chemotherapy use of abiraterone.  

Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said ‘We know how important it is for patients to have the option to delay chemotherapy and its associated side effects, so we are disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use in this way. 

‘However, it was clear that the drug is not cost effective at its current price.’
