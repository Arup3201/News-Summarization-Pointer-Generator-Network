She shot to fame in 1996 as one fifth of the biggest girl band in the world. Fast forward 18 years, 100m records and a lot of girl power later and Mel C is ready to do it all again.

As she prepares to release her new single, Cool As You, with up-and-coming musician Peter Aristone, Melanie Chisholm tells FEMAIL that she has no plans to slow down and there are many more collaborations, sporting events - and perhaps even another Spice Girls reunion to come.

Speaking about her new single, 40-year-old Mel said: 'I was approached by producer, Greg Haver, to contribute vocals to the track and embraced the idea.

'Cool As You is a powerful melodic ballad with cool rock credentials. It's a lovely song with a real Beatles feel to it.'

Mel has sold more than 12 million records and is the only female artist to reach the number one spot as part of a quartet, a quintet, a duo and solo, so isn't she ready to take a break from the fast-paced world of showbiz?

'Absolutely not,' she says. 'My number one love is performing and I want to be doing this forever. My current priorities are my spring/summer tour with Jules Holland and working on my own album.

'I haven't had an album out since 2011 and it's great to be back in the studio. It was Matt Cardle who inspired me to get back into it all after we collaborated together. I have so many opportunities falling at my feet and I am loving it.'

As well as recording, Mel has been taking her fitness extremely serious. She is an amateur triathlete, has completed the London Triathlon twice, and has been working with Sports Relief and an all-female event called Human Race in recent weeks.

'I'm sportier now than I was when I was in the Spice Girls,' she said. 'Exercise helps me keep my head healthy, boosts self-esteem and is so sociable. I find it such a healthy way to pass the time and I want to help take the intimidation out of sport,' she said.

As for her diet, Mel, who has openly spoken about her battle with eating disorders, says she follows the 80/20 rule: eating healthy 80 per cent of the time and what she wants 20 per cent of the time.

'I eat healthy most of the time, lots of carbs for fuel and good proteins. Juicing is great but I miss the actual food.

'On the weekend I have treats with my daughter - lots of cake and chips; it's all about moderation.'

Mel describes her five-year-old daughter Scarlett as her 'little buddy' but still finds motherhood 'exhausting'.

She said: 'Scarlett is going through the phase of waking up a lot in the night but she is so wonderful and great company.

'She loves singing and dancing and is getting into One Direction but I would never push her into doing what I did, I want her to do what she loves.' 

Just the four of us: Mel says she Mel B, Geri and Emma may consider doing something together in the future

Little Scarlett has good reason to want to follow in her successful mother's footsteps, Mel is currently the female artist with the second most number-one singles in the UK.

So what were the best bits from her stellar career? 'Performing at the Olympics with the Spice Girls was the absolute highlight of my career. The Brits in 1997 were fabulous, you all remember the Union Jack dress!

'My duet in 1998 with Bryan Adams was also amazing because it was the first musical thing I did outside of the Spice Girls and it really gave me confidence.'

The question on everyone's lips, as always, is will she and the Spice Girls ever get back together?

'We've talked about it,' she said. 'Victoria doesn't want to, which we completely understand. We are so proud of her and her incredible foray into fashion, it's incredible what she's achieved as a designer.

'The four of us could consider it maybe. We have Victoria's blessing to do that.'

Mel C's song with Peter Artisone Cool As You is out on March 31st.
