Jace was reportedly home alone when his wife arrived with their children from baseball practice.

Shortly before Jace called 911, police received calls from neighbors in the Hyde Park area
 who heard shots being fired inside the property after hearing arguing.

According to paperwork obtained by TMZ, Jace filed for bankruptcy in March 2011. 

He filed for Chapter 13, restructured his finances and reduced his mortgage, but owed $411,000 on the home where his wife was killed and it was on the brink of a foreclosure.

Jace was taken into custody and was later booked for his wife's murder, the LAPD confirmed on Tuesday. 

His bail has been set at $1million and according to police, the motive of the murder is believed to be domestic violence.  

According to TMZ, the 6ft 4in actor remained on the phone as instructed by dispatchers until LAPD officers arrived.

When officers entered the house they found April Jace, a mother-of-three, dead from gunshot wounds.

Police confirmed that at least two children - the third child is from a previous relationship - were in the home at the time of the shooting.

They have been placed in protective custody but officers were reportedly furious it took Children's Services four hours to get to the station and take the children to a family member. The kids were distraught, TMZ sources said.
