Lord Robert Winston, an IVF expert, has today warned some clinics are 'exploiting' infertile women

A fertility expert has today hit out at the 'exportation' of infertile women by some clinics.

IVF pioneer Lord Robert Winston told peers in the House of Lords, that regulation by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority allowed for 'entirely unvalidated experimental treatment'.

Giving an example, Lord Winston said many clinics advertise on the London Underground and 'some have relationships to do work overseas in other clinics, which are not allowed by British regulation'.

The Labour peer urged Health Minister Earl Howe to investigate and respond to this 'burning issue' and the' exploitation of infertile women'.

Lord Howe told him: 'I recognise the importance of the issue which you have raised and some of those issues are extremely troubling.'

The minister said he did not have an up-to-date statement on the policy position the Government was taking but promised to write to Lord Winston.

Lord Winston was recently reported to have warned that a growing market for fertility treatments could 'threaten our humanity', including if the rich were able to pay for so-called 'designer babies'.

The fertility expert who developed key advancements in IVF treatment told fellow academics at a conference last month 'we have been carried away' by breakthroughs in reproduction.

He claimed a ‘toxic’ climate had been created by the desperation of childless couples and the pace of scientific developments in the booming IVF industry.

Lord Winston, who is instantly recognisable from his TV programmes such as Child of Our Time and The Human Body, told the fertility conference that new genetic screening technologies meant scientists working with IVF needed to be particularly aware of the danger of eugenics becoming more prevalent.

Taking aim at fertility colleagues and patients, he said: ‘One of the problems with our work is that we have been carried away with massive enthusiasms in reproduction.

'That mixture of enthusiasm and patient desperation is actually a very toxic and heady mixture. It is worthwhile standing back a little from the technologies that we employ.

‘One of the issues of the market is that rich people may well be able to afford, in due course, the kind of enhancement to their genetics that other poor people may not be able to afford.’
