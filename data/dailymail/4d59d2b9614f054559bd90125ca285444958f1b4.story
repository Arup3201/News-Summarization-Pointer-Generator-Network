With a reshuffle thought to be just days away, most MPs and ministers are on best behaviour. The most desperate for promotion, or fearing the sack, will be doing anything to butter up the Prime Minister.

Not Matt Hancock. The Tory skills minister has posed for a photograph on London's South Bank, in front of graffiti declaring: 'Sack Cameron!'

To make matters worse, the MP for West Suffolk, was pictured smiling while riding a Boris Bike - the hire scheme of Mr Cameron's leadership rival Boris Johnson.

The photograph was taken for a feature in Total Politics magazine, which wrote: 'The Tory MP will doubtless claim he didn't set up the scene deliberately (apparently Hancock was innocently attending an event at the Southbank Skate Park to re-brand the Barclays/Boris bikes). 

'And yes, Total Politics's photographer insists he would never have asked the minister to stand there if he had noticed the offending words.'

Mr Hancock sought to laugh it off, suggesting on Twitter that it was 'another Photoshop triumph doing the rounds'.
