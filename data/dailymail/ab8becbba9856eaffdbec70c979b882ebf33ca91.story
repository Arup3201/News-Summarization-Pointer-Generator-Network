Australians living in the major cities will pay hundreds of dollars a year more for gas as prices rise.

A report from the Grattan Institute says has found that an average household gas bill in most major centres will soar by hundreds of dollars a year.

In Melbourne the price shock will be double most of the other big cities, the increase is expected to be as much as $435 a year and the country's very strong position in an emerging export industry is to blame.

Australians living in the major cities will pay hundreds of dollars a year more for gas as prices rise

Capital city residents are set to be hit hard with gas bills to jump significantly. Melbourne in particular will be hard hit with average household costs increasing as much as $435 a year 

The think-tank's energy program director, Tony Wood, argues the emergence of a Liquefied Natural Gas export industry over the next five years, which could be worth about $60 billion a year, will actually push prices up as Australians are forced to compete in the international market for supplies.

Australia will also struggle to meet its 2020 emissions reduction target, Mr Wood warns, as more coal is used for electricity generation in the face of rising gas prices.

In Melbourne, where 90 per cent of homes use gas for all their cooking, hot water and heating, an average bill could rise be as much as $435 a year, he said.

Sydney and Adelaide residents can expect a price gouge of more than $200 for their annual gas bill but Brisbane is expected to be spared

High gas users in Sydney will face an increase of about $225, while high users in Adelaide will pay an extra $200 a year. However, people in Brisbane, where gas consumption is low, would not be hit so hard.

'Gas producers have been building Liquefied Natural Gas facilities, mostly in Queensland, since 2010, and will start exporting as early as this year,' the report states.

'By 2018 east coast gas, added to growing West Australian supplies, could create the world's biggest gas export industry, worth $60 billion a year.

By 2018 planned gas exports from the east coast and WA could make Australia's industry worth more than $60 billion a year, to the detriment of the domestic market

'The downside is that domestic gas prices will increase to compete with the higher prices that other countries are prepared to pay for our gas.'

But Mr Wood says governments should resist pressure to introduce subsidies or the like to protect Australian industry and consumers.

'Reserving or subsidising gas for domestic use will add more costs than benefits and do nothing to increase supply. And in the long run, protection harms everyone,' he said.

The report says that for low users of gas - those using a gas cook-top or small-capacity gas hot water system - the increase to an average bill could be contained to less than $50 per year.
