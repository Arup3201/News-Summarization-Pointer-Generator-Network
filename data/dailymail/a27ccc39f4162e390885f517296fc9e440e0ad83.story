Cleared: Reg Traviss (pictured last week) said he was 'gobsmacked' over the rape accusation after he had sex with the woman in December 2011

Reg Traviss today said he was ‘gobsmacked’ after hearing he had been accused of rape - and admitted his time in court last week before being cleared of all charges was ‘absolute torture’.

The 35-year-old film producer and ex-boyfriend of Amy Winehouse said CCTV footage from his brother Richard’s London nightclub ‘made all the difference’ to ensuring he was found not guilty.

It showed his 27-year-old accuser having no difficulty walking from the club to a taxi - despite jurors at Southwark Crown Court being told that she was ‘so drunk she couldn't stand up or walk’.

‘They were more than lies,’ he told the Sun of her accusation. ‘It is one of the worst things you can say about a man. This was a girl I thought of as a friend. I had known her since 2007.’

Mr Traviss - who was accused of raping the woman twice in his flat in Marylebone, central London - had been in a relationship with Winehouse from 2010 and they were planning to marry when she died in July 2011, aged 27.

The CCTV showing Mr Traviss and the woman walking out of the club in December 2011 in heels unaided was found by the defence team and became a key part of the case. Mr Traviss and the woman later had sex at his flat.

But a month after they kissed goodbye the next day, the woman told police she had been raped by Mr Traviss - leaving him devastated and wanting to be co-operative with officers ‘to clear things up’.

But Mr Traviss said a police report described him as ‘the famous film director and partner of the late Amy Winehouse’ and he wondered if he was a ‘big scalp’, but was not scared about telling the truth.

He said the woman who gave evidence was angrier than the person he thought he knew - and has no emotions towards her now. He said the allegation was a ‘disgusting insult’ to real victims of rape.

‘It was absolute torture being locked in a glass box in court listening to shocking lies being said about you,’ he told the Sun. ‘I was so close to my life being over - and I had done nothing wrong.’

Mr Traviss said he was ‘staring at a death sentence’ and faced up to 10 years in jail if convicted - but following the end of the trial he is now looking forward to the ‘rest of my life’ and making a new film.

Cleared: Speaking on the steps outside Southwark Crown Court last week, Mr Traviss said the police should have dropped the investigation after looking at CCTV that contradicted her version of events

The director, who made the 2010 film Psychosis, featuring Buffy the Vampire Slayer star Charisma Carpenter and The Darkness singer Justin Hawkins, was first arrested over the allegations in April.

His lawyer, Ian Winter QC, said last week: 'It is an exceptional case and I don't think in my career that I have defended a case where I have been so sure of my client's innocence.

'What is unbelievable is that if we hadn't found them coming out of the club on that CCTV, which the police had totally failed to identify, there was a real risk of a miscarriage of justice.'

Hearing the verdicts last week, Mr Traviss closed his eyes and bowed his head. Emerging from the dock, he thanked Judge Deborah Taylor and hugged his family and friends.

And speaking on the steps outside Southwark Crown Court, Mr Traviss said the police should have dropped the investigation after looking at the CCTV that contradicted her version of events.
