The vultures who have been circling Southampton finally descended this summer and tore great chunks out of the club.

Liverpool have had the biggest feed, devouring their heart, Adam Lallana, and the guts, Rickie Lambert. On Sunday, they went for the spine with Dejan Lovren completing his £20million move to Anfield.

Manchester United ripped out the most tender part of all in young full back Luke Shaw. Tottenham took off with the brain; their manager Mauricio Pochettino.

And Arsenal are ready to swoop for £12m right back Calum Chambers and rival Tottenham for midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin.

But what’s left of a club who, in just four seasons, rose from League One to an eighth-place finish in the Barclays Premier League? A side who in their first campaign back in the top flight were described as the best to play at Old Trafford, by Sir Alex Ferguson.

Since former executive chairman Nicola Cortese quit in January after a dispute with owner Katharina Liebherr, there has been a complete overhaul at the top. New manager Ronald Koeman insists he was aware of the situation after meeting their head of football development Les Reed.

‘The first meeting with Les was open and the information was clear about the squad,’ said Koeman.

‘I knew Lambert, Lallana and Shaw would go. I had no influence on that. The most important message I gave is that we will keep the philosophy and ambition of the club.’

Soon to be rivals? Calum Chambers is moving to Arsenal while Morgan Schneiderlin is wanted by Spurs

In their first game last season, a 1-0 win at West Brom (Aug 17), Saints’ starting XI included Chambers, Lovren, Fonte, Shaw, Schneiderlin, Lallana, Lambert and Rodriguez. All have left or been linked with moves.

TEAM: Boruc; Chambers, Fonte, Lovren,Shaw; Lallana, Schneiderlin, Wanyama,Ward-Prowse; Lambert, Rodriguez.

The problem is, those who work closely with Southampton say that the philosophy has altered. One source said: ‘Under Cortese it was very much like Barcelona or Real Madrid, where it doesn’t matter who the head coach is it’s just that you do right by the club.’

In March, Liebherr appointed Ralph Krueger as chairman — a bold move given he had no football experience, though he had just led Canada to ice hockey gold at the Winter Olympics.

His complete absence from Southampton in the past six weeks, during such a crucial period, has not gone unnoticed by staff even though he has been keeping in touch by telephone.

Critics argue that Liebherr and Krueger know nothing about football and Reed is out of his depth.

‘Getting Katharina to stabilise the club after Cortese left is like getting a lunatic to run an asylum,’ said a source who has worked with a number of top-flight clubs.

Promises that Reed made to the fans in April have already been shattered. ‘We want to retain the players we’ve got,’ he said. ‘I think our fans deserve to understand that there is not going to be a fire sale here.’

Three months later their four best players have gone or are about to go with others set to follow. Matt Le Tissier, who played for Southampton for 16 years, suggests losing key figures around the club is nothing new.

‘When you’re a club of our size after the season we had there’s always a chance vultures will nick our best players,’ he said. ‘We’ve had to live with that, we’ve generally sold our most talented boys that came through our system. That’s the way it is.’

But another Saints legend Mick Channon is upset. ‘I don’t know when this is going to stop,’ he said. ‘It’s sad to see a side which was only going to get better being broken up. It’s getting beyond a joke. It’s the fans I feel for.’

It is understood the majority of funds made from sales — £27m for Shaw, £25m for Lallana, £4m for Lambert and £20m for Lovren — will be spent on recruitment. They are looking to sign six players in total for around £10m each rather than three at £20m.

They have already signed Dusan Tadic from FC Twente for £10.9m to replace Lallana and spent £8m on Feyenoord’s Graziano Pelle for Lambert. They will stick with their policy of bringing through players from their highly successful academy. For instance, 18-year-old Matt Targett is seen as the long-term replacement for Shaw.

‘When we start the season we will have a very good team,’ Koeman insisted. ‘We will bring in players with even better qualities.’

But promises have already been broken and some are tipping Southampton for  relegation. Indeed, the club’s future could well be decided by the time the transfer window shuts at the end of next month.
