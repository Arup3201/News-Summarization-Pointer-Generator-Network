Policy disarray: Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband said he would not reverse the coalition's cuts to child benefit for the better off

Ed Miliband vowed yesterday to slash the cost of welfare without cutting the size of benefits.

In a speech designed to convince voters that Labour can be trusted with the welfare system, he vowed to cap the overall costs of the social security system.

Mr Miliband admitted that the last Labour government got benefits wrong by letting incapacity payments run out of control.

But his attempts to turn the page were denounced as ‘vacuous’ after he failed to name a single new benefit that he would cut.

He simply repeated Monday’s announcement that Labour would take away winter fuel benefit from wealthier pensioners – a proposal which would cut just £100million from the benefits budget.

The Tories pointed out that Mr Miliband has opposed £83billion in benefit cuts during this Parliament.

The Labour leader also said ‘I don’t agree’ that his party spent too much money during its time in office. Repeatedly questioned on where he would find welfare savings, he would not commit to back the Government’s decision to limit benefits rises to 1 per cent or ditch his opposition to the Coalition’s cuts to the spare room subsidy, better known as the bedroom tax, which cuts housing benefit when rooms are unoccupied.

The Labour leader used a speech in Docklands opposite City Airport in London to make a bold bid to regain the upper hand in the benefits debate

Mr Miliband pledged to cap total spending on welfare, but gave little detail about how it would work in practice

He did not spell out at what level the
cap would be set, or what would happen  if a future Labour government 
breached it. Instead, Mr Miliband claimed that he could cut the cost of 
welfare by getting more people back to work and driving down the costs 
of housing benefit by getting councils to negotiate cheaper rents with 
landlords.

He told an audience in London’s 
Docklands: ‘The next Labour government will have less money to spend. If
we are going to turn our economy around, protect our NHS, and build a 
stronger country we will have to be laser-focused on how we spend every 
single pound.

‘Social security spending, vital as it
is, cannot be exempt from that discipline.’ He said Labour, if elected,
would introduce a cap on ‘structural spending’ – such as housing 
benefit and disability allowances which are not affected by sharp 
upturns in unemployment – for three years.

Mr Miliband admitted voters’ faith in 
the social security system had been ‘shaken’.

Kingston Jobcentre: Mr Miliband will call for those who have paid National Insurance for five years to get JobSeeker¿s Allowance of more than £100 a week - compared to £71 now

'No credible alternative': Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Miliband is too weak to deliver the tough policies that the country needs

He said: ‘Successive 
governments did not do enough to deal with the rise in people on 
incapacity benefit. It was a legacy of unemployment from the years Mrs 
Thatcher was in power. But the last Labour government should have acted 
on it sooner.’

Mr Miliband also spelled out plans to 
pay a higher rate of JobSeekers’ Allowance to those who have worked for 
at least five years. The full rate of JSA currently kicks in when people
have two years of contributions.

‘People’s faith in the system has been
shaken by a system that appears to give a minority of people something 
for nothing and other people nothing for something,’ Mr Miliband said.

He confirmed that he would not reverse the Coalition’s cuts to child benefit for high earners.

But even that U-turn will not save him
money compared with the Government’s plans. It means simply that he 
will not spend even more than the Coalition.

Mr Miliband claimed that Labour is 
‘the party of work’ and added: ‘We will tackle the deep, long-term 
causes of social security spending and tackle the costs of failure, like
housing benefit.’ He said Labour would also press employers to pay a 
‘living wage’ higher than the minimum wage – a move which some 
businesses have claimed will actually cost jobs.

The Labour leader repeatedly used the 
term ‘social security’ rather than ‘welfare’, apparently because polls 
show that voters regard Labour as the ‘welfare party’.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain 
Duncan Smith said: ‘They’ve become the welfare party, they’ve voted 
against £80billion of our savings in welfare and now we get finally a 
vacuous message saying they’re kind of in favour of an overall limit but
they don’t tell us what they would cut.

‘Having got us into this mess, today’s speech told us nothing about how he would get us out.’

Mr Duncan Smith said Labour had been 
billing yesterday’s speech as Mr Miliband’s ‘big moment’, and added: ‘If
this is his big moment, God help us when he has a small moment.’

The Labour leader tried yesterday to restore his party’s battered credibility on welfare with a string of policy announcements. Here, our Home Affairs Editor examines if the proposals will actually work, or if they are more empty gestures.

CAP THE BENEFIT BILLProposal: Impose a limit on so-called structural benefits, which means those payments such as Housing Benefit which do not fluctuate with the country’s economic fortunes. The cap will last three years to give ministers time to balance the books.Problem: Mr Miliband repeatedly refused to give any details on how the policy would work. A cap would be meaningless if it were deliberately fixed so high that it would never be reached. Labour does not support the Government’s individual benefits cap – which restricts the amount of welfare paid to families to £26,000 a year. The Tories say Mr Miliband has already opposed £83billion of welfare savings proposed by the Coalition.

GET EVERYBODY WHO’S FIT INTO WORKProposal: Slash welfare payments by getting the long-term jobless back into the workplace. The State would pay a person’s wages for 25 hours a week, on at least the minimum wage. The business would provide training of at least ten hours a week. Those who refused to take part would lose their benefits.Problem: Will fail if the jobs do not exist. Labour is reliant on  the private sector to create employment opportunities. Yet, at the same time, Mr Miliband is threatening to reinstate the controversial 50p tax rate for high earners – penalising the very wealth creators who will determine the idea’s success. Also, what will he do with the rump of people who simply refuse to work? Neither Labour MPs or the unions would tolerate withdrawing their benefits completely.

SLASH TAX CREDIT BILL BY INCREASING WAGESProposal: Expect employers in the private sector to pay a living wage of £7.45 an hour, or £8.55 in London. Mr Miliband claims that, for every pound that employers pay above the minimum wage (currently £6.19), government would save 50p in lower tax credits and benefits. The State would give contracts only to firms which pay the living wage.Problem: It would have a huge cost on businesses struggling their way out of recession and would cut tax income for the Exchequer. In a scathing assessment, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says: ‘There is not some sort of magic money out there that can allow big companies to pay more without any effect. If that money has to come from somewhere, it may come from their profits, which means less corporation tax. It may come from other people’s pay which means less income tax.’ 

FIX RENT LEVELS IN PRIVATE SECTORProposal: Give councils the power to force private landlords to reduce the rent they charge to tenants receiving Housing Benefit.Problem: Landlords will resent the State trying to interfere in the free market. They are under no obligation to rent to benefit claimants. Many may decide no longer to bother and rent only to tenants who pay their own bills.

TARGET SINGLE MUMS ON BENEFITSProposal: Send single mothers on courses, including CV writing, when their child is aged three or four to prepare them for the workplace.Problem: Mr Miliband is categorical that there would be no requirement to go back to work until the youngest child is five. This is the status quo so the policy will not save any money. Critics say it fails to address the issue of women who have large families who could still be reliant on benefits for a decade or more. Labour will not consider the idea of limiting child benefit to two or three children (though it now supports axing the payments altogether for higher earners).
