Aaron Ramsey is refusing to give up hope on the Premier League title as Arsenal continue their ascent up the table and lie just seven points behind leaders Chelsea.

The Gunners have won six league games on the bounce and are now within touching distance of second with an automatic qualification for the Champions League firmly in their sights.

But Ramsey is still confident that his side can push Jose Mourinho's side all the way in the race for the title.

He said: 'We just have to focus on ourselves and believe other teams around us will be on the end of upsets.

'We just have to try and win every game until the end of the season.

'In this division teams can lose against anyone. We have just got to be switched on and make sure it doesn't happen to us and maintain this run.

The midfielder played a key role in the Gunners victory over out-of-form Newcastle at St James' Park

'Stranger things have happened.'

Arsenal's next game could be a defining moment in the season for both teams involved as they welcome Liverpool to the Emirates Stadium.

Liverpool are currently chasing fourth and will be looking to bounce back following Sunday's disappointing defeat to Manchester United. 

Ramsey has been hampered by a number of injuries this season but is slowly getting back to his best
