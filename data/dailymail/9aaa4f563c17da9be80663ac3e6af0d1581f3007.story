A high school in Ohio has been put on lockdown after reports that a teenager is in an armed standoff with police.

Police now have the 14-year-old suspect in custody after cordoning him off in a hallway at Scott High School in Toledo, Ohio. They have determined he had a pellet gun and not a firearm, according to the Toledo News Now.

Lt. Mark King said in a press conference that the suspect, whose name has not been released, was injured in the standoff but not critically.

Captured: The 14-year-old suspect has not been named but was announced as a student at Scott High School, and is now in police custody following the Monday morning incident

Prepared for the worst: SWAT teams were on hand for the altercation but only later found out he only had a pellet gun and not a firearm

The boy, who was a student at Scott High School in Toledo, was agitated from an incident earlier in the day and took the pellet gun out of his bag.

Police cordoned him off in a hallway near some lockers while telling all other students in the school to hide and take cover. Two classrooms directly adjoining that hallway were evacuated.

Police injured the suspect after shooting him in the foot with a bean bag pellet but it is not life-threatening. No other injuries were reported.

The boy is being transported to the detectives' department for questioning and will likely face charges though those have not yet been specified.

A spokesman for the school district said that he will be expelled as a result of the Monday morning incident.

Cordoned off: The student was said to be alone in a classroom with the gun

'The schools are the safest place in the communities and the students see that,' he said at a press conference.

'Our staff did exactly what they are trained to do.'

Parents were initially told to stay away from the school in the midst of the standoff, but now that police have the suspect in custody, they have been told to pick their children up from the field house at 11.30am for an early dismissal.

An aunt of the suspect told Toledo News Now that her nephew did not have any mental issues and that she wanted 'to get to the bottom of the story'.
