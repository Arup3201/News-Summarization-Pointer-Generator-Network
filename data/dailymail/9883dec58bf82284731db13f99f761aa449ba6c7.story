Any mere mortal would cower at the thought of having to face the human wrecking ball that is Ma'a Nonu but Kyle Eastmond is relishing the challenge of stopping the All Black in Saturday's first Test at Eden Park.

England's midfield defence will be tested mercilessly by Nonu and his New Zealand team-mates as they look to exploit a potential weakness in Stuart Lancaster's side.

Eastmond will deputise at inside centre after Billy Twelvetrees failed to win his fitness battle and he will partner fourth choice fly-half Freddie Burns, who had a difficult season at Gloucester, in an inexperienced midfield.

Ready: Kyle Eastmond is relishing the prospect of facing Ma'a Nonu and the All Blacks on Saturday

Undercooked? The inside centre is fourth choice in his position and has not played since April

Inexperienced: Eastmond and fly-half Freddie Burns (centre) have only seven caps between them

The diminutive Eastmond, who has not played since April, will be winning only his third cap and Burns just his fourth.

But Eastmond is ready for the assault that awaits when the series begins in Auckland.

He said: 'I've been playing rugby now since I was seven years old. You have to make tackles, it's as simple as that.'

'It's an attitude thing that has to be shared by everyone, it's not an individual thing.

'New Zealand have some big guys, but we've put in a lot of homework throughout the team to give us the best opportunity against them.

'I'll try to offer exactly what I've done throughout my career - try to get on the ball and bring energy and spark to help out my team-mates.'

Lancaster's choice at inside centre is limited due to Twelvetrees' injury, as well as Luther Burrell and Brad Barritt being unavailable after appearing in last Saturday's Aviva Premiership final.

And Eastmond himself fell out of favour at Bath and has been omitted from their matchday 23 since.

The 24-year-old rugby league convert, who impressed during last summer's tour to Argentina, is fourth choice but is determined to grab the opportunity with both hands.

'We've put some good work in and I'm feeling all right. I've played a lot of games this season so match fitness is not something I have in mind at all,' Eastmond said.

'I'm confident I'll be okay with the match fitness. I've very excited. I've trained well and hard over the last couple of weeks.'

Eastmond has lost ground in England's pecking order this season with Twelvetrees and Burrell overtaking him, but he takes a measured view on his progress.

'I have to put it into perspective where I'm at. This is the end of my second season in rugby union,' he said.

'The players who have been playing in my position have been playing really well.

'Luther got his chance and Billy played well throughout the Six Nations.

'I've had to be patient and wait for my chance. Now it has come.'
