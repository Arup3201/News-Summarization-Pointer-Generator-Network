Arsene Wenger believes Thierry Henry is destined to return to Arsenal. Henry left New York Red Bulls at the end of their MLS season and is not expected to play on at the age of 37.

‘One day he will come back,’ said Wenger. ‘In what role, I don’t know. He has to think about what direction he wants to go in.

‘I don’t think he wants to carry on (playing). He has given a lot.’

Wenger has sent a text message to congratulate Henry on closing a glittering career. He also urged the French FA to turn a proposed friendly, against Brazil in March, into a farewell game in honour of the striker.

‘That is the minimum the French Federation can do, they owe him that,’ said Wenger, but his career advice for Henry was not to make a hasty decision. 

‘I made him start at the age of 17 in Monaco,’ said Wenger. ‘So he had 20 years of competitive football and that deserves high respect and congratulations —not only for what he achieved but also for his focus on football.

‘He has the right to reflect and think of what he wants to do now. He is an Arsenal man. The best moments of his life and of his career have been here.’

Henry spent eight years at Arsenal after signing from Juventus in 1999. 

He returned on loan from NYRB for a short spell in 2012 and is the club’s record goalscorer with 228. 

It is quite rare for Wenger to invite former players into his backroom team. Steve Bould is assistant manager after working his way up through the academy. 

‘There’s a right number to have but I’m not against it,’ said Wenger.

Henry has spoken of his desire to coach. ‘He is intelligent, committed, he loves the game,’ said Wenger. 

‘He has to think: Do I want to sacrifice the rest of my life to be involved in that job? You have to realise there is nothing else. 

'If you look around me, people who have worked without interruption for 30 years in this job, you will not find many.’
