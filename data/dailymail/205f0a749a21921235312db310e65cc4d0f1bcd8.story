The New York man photographed on Nov. 6 riding the subway naked has been identified and says his days of letting it all hang out are far from over.

The New York Post has identified the naked subway rider who appeared on the cover of the newspaper last Saturday as Ed Haines, a homeless 40-year-old man.

Haines is regularly seen in the buff on park benches in Madison Square Park in Manhattan, according to the Post, but last week was the first time he graced the cover of a newspaper in his birthday suit -- very Kim Kardashian-esque.

Snoozing: On Nov. 6, Haines was caught snoozing on the E train naked, wearing only socks and a pair of sneakers

'I like to be naked. It turns me on,' Haines told the Post. 'I wish I could do it all the time. I would if I could, if I wouldn’t get in trouble.'

On Nov. 6, Haines was caught snoozing on the southbound E train naked, wearing only socks and a pair of sneakers. Passengers watched as Haines took swigs of whiskey in between naps, according toDaily News. 

At first, Haines denied to the Post's reporters that the naked man in the photograph was him, but then admitted that it was saying he was so drunk he ended up in a hospital that night and didn't remember the trip there.

It was only when he sobered up that night that he recalled being naked in public, the Post reports, however, he didn't realize the extent of his nudity until he saw himself on the front page of the Post.

'I saw it in The Post and knew I had been naked,' Haines said. 

Haines admitted to the Post that he gets naked ' a lot' and jokingly said he is jealous of Kim Kardashian's similar exploits.

'I wish I could get naked like that,' he said.

The photograph of Haines on the subway last week was photographed by Peter Davis, an editor at the Daily Front Row fashion magazine, who said Haines -- unidentified at the time -- was 'really drunk' during the train ride.

'He would swig it and then nod out,' Davis told the Post. 'He must’ve taken four swigs in four stops.'

Haines reportedly rode the train for at least five stops with as many as 30 passengers on the train.

Davis said last week that Haines looked oblivious and didn't seem to care when he snapped the photo around 8pm. 

The photo of Haines' naked body went viral when Davis posted the photo to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where comments ranged from jokes about the man to concern, according to Daily News.

In his Facebook post featuring the photo, Davis wrote 'Just spotted on the E Train. After a lifetime in NYC I thought I had seen everything...'

Some made light of the situation with comments like 'They turned on the heat on the subways today. I'm just sayin'... It was hot down there,' and 'He didn't want to take off his shoes and socks for fear of getting athlete's foot.'

Some Twitter users were more concerned, tweeting things like 'This is so incredibly SAD. His bag of life belongings must be next to him. He's probably mentally ill and tragically lonely.'

The incident seemed to be very similar to a scene from an episode of the popular TV show 'Seinfeld.' 

In the season three episode titled 'The Subway' Jerry has a strange train encounter of his own when he awakes from a catnap to find a naked man sitting directly across from his reading a newspaper.

Haines told the Post that he had, in fact, seen the episode and thought his actions fit the scene.
