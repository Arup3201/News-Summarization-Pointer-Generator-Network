A toddler in North Carolina and his pet dog have died after they climbed into the family's hot car and got stuck.

Logan Cox, from Lancaster County, died Sunday morning at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, officials said.

The boy's cause of death has not yet been determined, as medical examiners were awaiting information from the hospital to help in their investigation.

Stuck: The child and his pet dog, pictured, climbed into the family's hot car and got stuck last Wednesday

The 3-year-old boy suffered severe heat stroke Wednesday after he climbed into a car at the family's home and became trapped inside, the Lancaster County Sheriff's office told the Herald Online.

The boy was conscious but red-faced when he was finally discovered, though complained of being hot, his grandfather, Jimmy Clevinger, said last week.

EMS took the child to the Buford Volunteer Fire Department, where he was flown to Carolinas Medical Center.

On Thursday, doctors told the boy's family that he wasn't responding to stimuli like they wanted but that his condition would hopefully improve.

Logan lived with his parents and grandparents at the home where deputies say he slipped undetected out of the front door and into the car where he was playing with the pet, a 9-year-old basset hound/pit bull mix.

But he then couldn't get out of the black Mitsubishi Galant.

It's not clear how long the little boy was in the car.

His grandmother called 911 and a recording of the call reveals her daughter, Amber Bender, and grandson had been sitting together on the couch watching television when she 'dozed off.'

Bender was asleep for around 30 minutes when Logan was discovered, the grandmother said.

When she woke up she realized her son was missing.

Relatives then found Logan in the locked car when they noticed the hazard lights blinking.

Clevinger said the boy had learned how to unlock the car door but was unable to push it back open to get out because the weight of the door was too much.

The dog also died.
