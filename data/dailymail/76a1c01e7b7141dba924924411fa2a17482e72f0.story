At the World Cup opening ceremony on Thursday, a paraplegic will leave behind their wheelchair to take to the pitch in this robotic suit

The most impressive kick of the World Cup won't come from a known football star.

Instead, it will be from a paraplegic teenager who will use a robotic bodysuit to kick a ball using his or her mind.

For the past few months, Brazilian doctor Miguel Nicolelis has been putting the final touches to  the futuristic exoskeleton, which was designed to enable paralysis victims to walk.

At the World Cup opening ceremony on Thursday in 
Sao Paulo, a paraplegic - whose identity has been kept secret - will 
leave behind their wheelchair to take to the pitch in the suit.

The exoskeleton, which has been designed as part of the international 'Walk Again Project', will use motorised metal braces to support and bend the teenager’s legs.

The suit itself will be controlled by 
patterns of brain activity detected by electrodes placed either on the 
scalp or in the brain itself. 

These signals will be sent wirelessly
 to a computer worn by the wearer, converting them into movements. 

The
 team have incorporated sensors into the exoskeleton that feed 
information about touch, temperature and force back to the wearer. The 
feedback is expected to come through a visual display or a vibrating 
motor.

‘It's the first time an exoskeleton has been controlled by brain activity and offered feedback to the patients,’ Dr Nicolelis, a neuroscientist at Duke University, told AFP.Scroll down for video

The teenager had undergone training in a virtual reality
 simulator to translate thoughts into signals to the robotic armour.

‘Doing a demonstration in a stadium is something very much outside our routine in robotics. It's never been done before.’

Dr Nicolelis said his team have barely left the lab since March, when they arrived in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city and economic hub, to make the final preparations.

But it's been rewarding, too, he said, recalling the moment on 24 April when a paralysed user first took steps in the exoskeleton.

Dr Nicolelis’ voice contains a mix of exhaustion and excitement, the result of 30 years' work, more than 200 scientific papers and countless clinical tests that are nearing a spectacular summit.

The scientist started down this path in 1984 when he wrote his doctoral thesis on neural connections in muscular control.

He said the idea for the suit came to him in 2002, when scientists were just beginning to explore robotic exoskeletons.

The team have named the device the 
Bra-Santos Dumont, a combination of the three-letter sporting code for 
Brazil and Alberto Santos-Dumont, a Brazilian inventor who once 
demonstrated controllable flight was possible by flying his dirigible 
around the Eiffel Tower.

Some scientists have criticised Dr Nicolelis for ditching academic publications in favour of mass media - he posts research updates on Facebook - and the anonymity of the lab for the lights of the World Cup stage.

Critics have also questioned the practicality of his research and accused him of hogging an unfair share of the Brazilian government's research budget. Dr Nicolelis rejects that criticism.

‘The funding is the same with or without the World Cup,’ he said.

‘We've received $14 million (£8.4 million) from the Brazilian government over the last two years.

‘That's approximately four or five times less than what the United States government invests in a mechanical arm.’

‘I don't see anything wrong with demonstrating a technology for the whole world that has a humanitarian objective and was paid for by civil society,’ he added.

More than 65,000 people will be in Sao Paulo's Corinthians Arena to watch the BRA-Santos Dumont's first steps in public before Brazil play Croatia in the opening match. Around a billion are expected to watch on TV.
