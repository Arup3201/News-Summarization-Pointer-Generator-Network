It's the perfect gadget for holidaymakers who fancy an impromptu picnic on the beach or in a city park - but just don't fall out over dinner.

The portable Napkin Table, suitable for two people, has been designed to encourage conversation between diners by connecting them together.

The product, which folds out from a carry bag-style, has straps that fasten around each person's neck, with trays that join in the middle suspended between them.

Social aim: The table straps around two people's necks, with trays in between for food and drinks

Stylish design: The table folds out from a bag-style design with a handle

It means plates and food can be placed in the middle, while the couple sits closely together, facing one another.

The fabric stretches out from the trays, creating extra surface space for eating - and doubling as a bib under each diner's chin for any rogue crumbs.

There are also two napkins attached, cut-out holes for cups and stitched pockets for utensils in the product, which was created by graduates in from the Tunghai University in Taiwan.Â
