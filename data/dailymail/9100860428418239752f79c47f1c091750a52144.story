With 20 goals in his last 13 games, Cristiano Ronaldo's scoring record is beginning to resemble something that belongs to another planet.

So naturally, the new Nike advert he stars in called 'Out of this World' adds poetic licence to his goals to games ratio, by showing him crash landing on earth via a meteor.

The Portuguese international is squatting the weight of a Ferrari when Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti calls him up for El Clasico, having witnessed Ronaldo's outlandish arrival from outer space.

Carlo Ancelotti watches Ronaldo land on earth, and instantly calls him with El Clasico approaching

Ronaldo, squatting the weight of a Ferrari, answers Ancelotti's call and heads to Madrid (after racing a jet)

Wearing his new Nike Mercurials, he leaves a jet plane trailing in his wake in a scene that will be a little bit too familiar for most La Liga full-backs, before slaloming between trees in a forest and powering up a mountain.

With Madrid preparing for the visit of Barcelona, Ronaldo prepares for one of the world's most illustrious fixtures by indulging in some free running, leaping across the rooftops as supporters flock to the Santiago Bernabeu.

He pauses, takes a moment to observe the cauldron that is Madrid's stadium before leaping from a huge height onto the pitch.

Ronaldo also shows off his skills while wearing his new Nike Mercurial football boots

And these are the boots that enable Ronaldo to perform the way he does - the new Nike Mercurials

Ronaldo will hope his goal threat will beat Barcelona's front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar

Ronaldo will look to extend his seemingly untameable scoring spree against Barcelona in the real world on Saturday, but Madrid will be the first side to face the Catalan attack containing Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar.

But it remains to be seen whether that front three is more formidable than the new Mercurials.
