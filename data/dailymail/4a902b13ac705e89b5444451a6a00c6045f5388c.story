As far as attempts for breaking world records go, this event in Bali surely has to be one of the most stress-free.

One thousand masseurs from all over Indonesia gathered at Sanur Beach to set a new world record for the largest-ever mass massage.

Lying on palmyra leaf mats, with the beautiful Indonesian coastline as the backdrop, 1,000 lucky participants were continuously massaged for 15 minutes in a bid to land the new record title.

And relax: One thousand masseurs have broken the world record for the largest simultaneous massage. The successful attempt took place at a beach in Sanur, Bali, Indonesia

The event was organised to beat the previous world record held by masseurs in Bangkok, Thailand, who carried out 641 simultaneous massages in July last year

The record-breaking challenge was called 'Two thousand therapists' hands in traditional Indonesian massage' and saw the masseurs carry out the treatments for 15 minutes

The event, which saw therapists travel from Bali, Central Java and East Java to take part, broke the previous world record which had been set in July last year in Bangkok, Thailand.

During that world record attempt, 641 masseurs had carried out continuous treatments for 12 minutes.

Wayan 
Sudani, 38, one of the spa therapists, said participating 
in the event in Bali had been a rare opportunity.

She said: 'Moreover, we got a certificate
 for participating in the event. I am really proud to be part of it.'

Mother-of-three Ketut
 Kamiasih, another masseur taking part, said: 'I am really happy took
 part in this event and am glad I could.

'Many therapist failed to 
participate because they only needed 1,000 therapists.'

The 1,000 participants were asked to lie on palmyra leaf mats while their masseurs, who were dressed in matching purple and blue outfits, carried out their work

The masseurs came from Bali, Central Java and East Java to take part in the record-breaking attempt

Many therapists were unable to take part in the challenge because only 1,000 masseurs were needed

At the event, the therapists - who were dressed in matching purple and blue outfits - were later divided into groups giving nine types of treatments.

Those included Javanese lulur, which is a body scrub, a Balinese boreh, which is a body mask and Bugis tellu sulapa eppa, another body scrub.

There were also herbal steam baths, traditional saunas, exfoliation treatment susing egg protein, detoxifying rituals and steam treatments.

Russel Collins, an Australian who volunteered to take part in the record-breaking attempt, said: 'It’s wonderful. I like Balinese massage.

“In Australia, we have to pay $80 to $90, while in Bali we can have one for only $30.'

Indonesian Museum of Records (MURI) founder Jaya Suprana said the event - part of the 'Wonderful Adventure Indonesia: Asia Pacific Hash 2014 initiative' - had broken the world record, based on the last world record held in Thailand.

She presented a MURI certificate to the Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Mari Elka Pangestu.

She said: 'We should be proud that we’ve broken the world record.

'Thank you for agreeing to be massaged by our therapists. For all participating therapists, we sincerely thank you and are very proud of you. You do excellent work. Thank you for your wonderful hands.'
