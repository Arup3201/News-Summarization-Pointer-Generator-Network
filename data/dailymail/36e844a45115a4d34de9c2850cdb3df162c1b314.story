Australian wicketkeeper Matthew Wade unveiled a tattoo of the late Phillip Hughes on his arm after his state of Victoria won the domestic Sheffield Shield competition.

The 27-year-old showed off the touching tribute to his former international team-mate, who tragically died late last year after being hit on the side of the head by a bouncer.

Wade was celebrating Victoria's 29th Sheffield Shield first-class title after they drew with Western Australia at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart.

Wade has played 12 Tests, 47 one-day internationals and 22 T20s for Australia but was left out of their World Cup squad. 

Hughes died aged 25 as a result of a blow on the head from a Sean Abbott bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match between New South Wales and South Australia in November.

Victoria finished in first place on points during the regular season, meaning they only needed a draw to take the title. The match in the island state of Tasmania due to the unavailability of the Melbourne Cricket Ground because of Sunday's World Cup final.

The winners finished on 158 for four, trailing Western Australia by 175 runs. After Western Australia declared at 293 for two earlier Wednesday with a 333-run lead, Victoria did little to chase down the target, with no runs being scored in eight overs during the final session.

Fawad Ahmed took 8-89 for Victoria in the first innings to set a finals record.
