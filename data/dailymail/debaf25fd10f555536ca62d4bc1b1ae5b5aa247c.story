It may look and even sound like the real thing, but this Airbus A380 is actually a scaled-down model of the jumbo airliner and is flown using a handheld remote control.

A video has appeared online that shows the plane being flown at an air show and hobbyist event in Germany.

The remote-controlled plane has an 18-foot wingspan, weighs 150lbs and is powered by four jet turbines.

The Airbus A380 is a superjumbo that 
took its first flight on April 2005.

It later became a commercial plane with Singapore Airlines in 2007.

There are a total of 115 A380s in operation as of November 2013.

It is a double decker jet with a 
wingspan of 79.75 metres.

It seats 535 people and each plane costs $390 
million (£242 million) to make.

It is unclear who the pilot of the plane is, or who is filming the jet’s takeoff and landing in the video, but similar models use engines that are said to cost around £1,800 ($3,000) each.

During the video, the pilot is shown taxiing the model Airbus A380 – with the logo of Singapore Airlines printed on the side – around a field and onto a runway.

The plane takes off, flies above a cheering crowd for almost five minutes before coming down to land using its tailwheel-type landing gear.

With its 18-foot wingspan, the remote-controlled model is 14 times smaller than the full-sized Airbus A380.

The cabin is designed to make it more comfortable for passengers because it has a higher pressurisation than previous generations. 

The A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of 5,000 ft up to 41,000 ft giving it 50 per cent less cabin noise and 50 per cent more cabin area and volume.

It also has larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and an extra 2 foot of headroom compared to the 747 model.
