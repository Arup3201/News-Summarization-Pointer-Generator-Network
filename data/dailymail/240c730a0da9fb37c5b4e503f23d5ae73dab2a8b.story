Former NRL star Mark Gasnier may be selling up to build his dream house, but his stunning Sydney home of five years is perfectly dreamy in its own right.

The Fox Sports commentator and his wife Claudine have put their beach-side Avalon home on the market.

They have lived in the breathtaking three-bedroom retreat for almost five years and are now looking to move on but remain within the area, with an asking price of $2,495,000.

It was a surprise for player who never expected to live on the Northern Beaches, let alone fall in the love with the coastal area.
