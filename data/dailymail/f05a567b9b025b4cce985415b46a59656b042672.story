The family of the Cheeki Rafiki's skipper are 'shocked and deeply saddened' after the search for the four missing sailors was called off.

The
 U.S. Coastguard dramatically revealed at 2am today that the life raft 
had been found undeployed inside the upturned hull of the yacht, which 
was found adrift last night.

The
 revelation effectively ended any last hopes that the four 
men on board the boat might have somehow survived.

Also on board were Paul Goslin, 56 (left), and Steve Warren, 52 (right), who had planned to sail a different ship

Tragically,
 it has emerged that two of the sailors were originally due to embark on
 a different boat, before switching to the Cheeki Rafiki at the last 
minute.

Relatives of skipper Andrew Bridge, 22, said: 'We are obviously shocked and deeply saddened by the news.

'Andrew will be dearly missed by everyone who knew him.'

Mr Bridge had been competing at a regatta in Antigua with James Male, 23, Steve 
Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56.

Mr Warren and Mr Goslin had been due to sail a different ship but changed at the last minute.

Mr Goslin's family said that he was 'fulfilling one of his lifelong dreams' by sailing across the Atlantic.

A statement read: 'As you can imagine we were deeply saddened by the news on Friday night and are struggling to come to terms with the fact that Paul, our wonderful husband, son, father, grandfather, won't be found alive and returned home to us.

Hopes ended: In this photo provided by the United States Navy, the overturned hull of the Cheeki Rafiki is seen 1,000 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The crew never managed to launch their life raft

'Paul was deeply loving and exceptionally intelligent and we know will be missed by everyone that knew him.

'Paul
 had been a passionate sailor for many years and loved everything to do 
with the water. He'd been talking about sailing across the Atlantic for 
many years.

'We are, therefore, trying to take some comfort in the knowledge that he was fulfilling one of his lifelong dreams.'

Relatives of yachtsman James Male, aged 23 years, said: 'As you can imagine we are deeply saddened by Friday's news and struggling to come to terms with the fact that James is missing.

'James was a passionate sailor, surfer, kayaker and all round water sport enthusiast as well as being a keen snowboarder and outdoor instructor.

Damage: Navy crews observed that the sailing vessel's windows were smashed and the keel broken off, causing a breach in the hull

'He loved being in the outdoors and on the water teaching new skills to people.

'We must therefore try to take some comfort in the knowledge that he was doing something he really loved.'

The family's statement, released via the Foreign Office, added: 'The past week has been a very difficult one for all the families and we have drawn strength from each other and hopefully we can continue to do so.

'James would have been amazed by the overwhelming support shown to us all by the public, which has made this week slightly easier to bear.

'We would like to thank everyone who helped us in our search. Special thanks must go to the US and Canadian Coast Guards, the US Navy, the RAF, the merchant vessels and smaller yachts that sailed through the area.

'We must also thank the UK Government, the support the Foreign Office has provided us with in the past week has been second to none.

'This has been very comforting and we could not have done without it.'

On their way back to England last 
Thursday, the crew hit extreme sea conditions and radioed that their 
yacht was taking on water.

After
 closing the search with no findings last week, US authorities caved to 
pressure from the families of the four men to continue on Tuesday.

Distressing: The revelation that the lifeboat was not deployed effectively ends any last hopes of the families of the four men on board the boat that they might have somehow survived.

A U.S. Navy warship helicopter spotted the flooded hull - with its windows smashed - 1,000 miles off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

There was initially no sign of the life raft but today's discovery brought the rescue efforts to a close.

Mr Warren's uncle, Albert Davey, told the
 BBC: 'It's not the ending we would want but we have got to gain some 
small consolation that Steve was doing what he thoroughly enjoyed doing 
and I think we have got to cling on to that.'

Paying tribute to the yachtsmen, David Cameron tweeted: 'My thoughts are with the families of the
 crew of the Cheeky Rafiki after the sad news its hull has been found 
with the life-raft unused.'

Foreign
 Secretary William Hague said: 'It is very sad news. It was an awful 
moment yesterday to discover the life raft was still there in the boat.'

Early this morning, the U.S. Coast Guard released a new 
statement, saying: ‘The U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed the 
life raft aboard the capsized sailing vessel Cheeki Rafiki was secured 
in its storage space in the aft portion of the boat, Friday, indicating 
it was not used for emergency purposes.

Same again: Officials claim today's sighting was of the same overturned hull spotted on Saturday (pictured) by a cargo vessel 1,000 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts

The hull, which crew on the MV Maersk Kure container ship photographed, has tonight been identified as the Cheeki Rafiki, the Foreign Office has revealed

‘A U.S. Navy warship smallboat crew 
and surface swimmer captured underwater imagery clearly identifying the 
raft in its storage space. The image was shared with and acknowledged by
 the families.’

Britain's Foreign Office said it has 
decided to recall a Royal Air Force plane which had been due to search 
for the Cheeki Rafiki's four missing crew for one more day, after the 
U.S. Coast Guard also called off its search.

Mr
 Warren's family, who have now requested privacy, added in a statement: 
'We are very sad that the US has now suspended the search.

'From
 the beginning we, together with the other families involved, have 
continued to hold out hope that he would be found alive.'
