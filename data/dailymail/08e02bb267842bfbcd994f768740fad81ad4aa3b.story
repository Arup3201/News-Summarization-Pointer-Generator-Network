Just days earlier he was contemplating whether he might lose his freedom but now John Edwards has been seen publicly for the first time with his 'precious' daughter Quinn enjoying Father's Day weekend.

The one-time presidential candidate was pictured with the four-year-old - whose mother is his former mistress Rielle Hunter -Â  playing on the beach at Figure Eight Island in North Carolina. The 59-year-old ran in and out of the water with the girl as the pair chatted easily together.

Edwards publicly referred to Quinn for the first time last month after he was acquitted at a trial where he had been accused of using campaign money 
to cover up his affair with Hunter, 48, and her subsequent pregnancy.

Daddy's girl: John Edwards, 59, spent the weekend at the beach with his four-year-old daughter Quinn - whose mother is his former mistress Rielle Hunter

First pictures: John Edwards was seen playing on a beach in North Carolina with his four-year-old daughter Quinn by mistress Rielle Hunter

Bonding: The pair chatted easily as they spent Father's Day together with Quinn's mother Ms Hunter at a $4,000-a-week rental home by the shore

After the verdict, where he was acquitted of one count of corruption and a mistrial declared on the five other counts, Edwards emerged from the court house saying he was grateful to all of his children - including his 'precious Quinn'.

He said: 'My precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you can ever imagine, who I am so close to, so, so grateful for.'

The father and daughter were seen playing on the sand on Sunday close to where they were staying in a $4,000-a-week rental home. Later they held hands when they went to pick up groceries with her mother Rielle - who was also at the house.

The disgraced senator has only ever been pictured with Quinn once before when she was a baby in 2008.

The snatched photos, published in the National Enquirer, broke the news of the scandalous affair which Edwards had been keeping secret from his wife Elizabeth who was dying of cancer.

Carefree: Edwards laughed as his young daughter danced on the sand. He had walked from court last month after being acquitted of one count of corruption and a mistrial declared on five other counts against him

Holding hands: At the end of his political corruption trial, Edwards spoke publicly for the first time about Quinn, saying he was 'so grateful' for his young daughter

In the public eye: John Edwards and his daughter were at the beach house with her mother Rielle - who has an explosive book about their affair due out this week

Rielle Hunter strutted on the beach in a white tankini this weekend. The candid photos came as Hunter was on the verge of revealing lurid details about her sex life with Edwards and the passion that drove him so mad he cheated on his cancer-stricken wife and sabotaged his presidential campaign in 2008. Mrs Edwards died of breast cancer in 2010.

She has written a book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' to publicly explanation the six-year romance to the couple's love child, Frances Quinn Hunter. The former campaign videographer leaves little to the imagination about her sex life.

Hunter described the first time she slept with Edwards as the 'most extraordinary night of her life.'

Edwards met Rielle Hunter in a New York hotel bar in 2006. She soon joined his campaign, and despite a lack of film-making experience, the politician arranged a $250,000 contract for her to make a series of behind-the-scenes documentaries from the campaign trail.

When Hunter fell pregnant he had a trusted aide Andrew Young claim paternity of Quinn in an effort to stave off political disaster.

He didn't publicly acknowledge his love child until 2010, when she was nearly two.

Baby of the bunch: John Edwards' youngest daughter Quinn (pictured) has older half-siblings Cate, Emma-Claire and Jack

Edwards had four other children with his late wife Elizabeth - Wade, who died in 1996, Cate, Emma-Claire and Jack. Wade was killed when his jeep was blown off a highway by high winds in North Carolina when he was 17 years old.

His eldest daughter Cate was by his 
side throughout the corruption case in North Carolina. The 30-year-old 
lawyer took notes by her father's side - but at one point during the 
six-week trial, she fled the courtroom in tears after details of her 
father's betrayal of her late mother became too much.

During
 his teary speech on the court steps after he walked free, he paid 
thanks to Cate, saying: 'She has been here every single day by my side. 
She has been here no matter what or how awful and painful the evidence 
was for her.

'Evidence 
about her dad and her mom, who she loves so, so dearly. She never once 
flinched but said ''Dad, I love and you and I'll be there with you no 
matter what", and I'm so proud to have her with me.'
