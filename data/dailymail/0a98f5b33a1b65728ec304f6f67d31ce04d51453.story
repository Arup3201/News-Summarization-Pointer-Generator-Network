Fernando Torres has escaped a four-match ban for scratching the face of Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen.

The Chelsea striker was captured on television gouging Vertonghen, leaving visible marks. The clash was however, missed by referee Mike Dean, leading the Football Association to review the incident.

But, as Dean's assistant Jake Collin saw the incident, under FA rules, no action can be taken and farcically he escapes any extra ban.

He will instead serve a one-game 
suspension after he was later sent off in the 1-1 draw at White Hart 
Lane for two bookable offences. The Spaniard will subsequently miss 
Chelsea's trip to Norwich on Saturday.

A statement read: ‘The FA will 
take no action against Chelsea’s Fernando Torres in relation to an 
incident involving Tottenham Hotspur's Jan Vertonghen which occurred in 
the 50th minute of their match on Saturday 28 September 2013.

‘One of the match officials saw the coming together of the two players, albeit not in its entirety.'

'The FA will 
take no action against Chelsea’s Fernando Torres in relation to an 
incident involving Tottenham Hotspur's Jan Vertonghen which occurred in 
the 50th minute of their match on Saturday 28 September 2013.

‘One of the match officials saw the coming together of the two players, albeit not in its entirety.'

The FA has put a new system in place 
where a panel of three former referees will look at incidents 
retrospectively and decide if charges should be brought.

That
replaces the old system where action was only taken if the referee 
viewed the footage and judged whether he should have sent a player off.

However,
in both cases if any match official saw part of the incident, even if 
not the full detail, then the FA cannot take further action.

The
FA statement added: 'In these particular circumstances, in line with 
the FA's policy on when retrospective action may be taken, reviewed this
summer by the game's stakeholders (the Premier League, the Football 
League, the Professional Footballers' Association, the League Managers 
Association, Professional Game Match Officials Limited and the National 
Game), no action may be taken.'
