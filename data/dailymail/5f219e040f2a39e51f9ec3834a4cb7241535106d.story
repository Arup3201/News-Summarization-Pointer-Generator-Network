Veteran: Malcolm Norris, 91, pictured on holiday two years ago, was admitted to hospital and died earlier this month. But his family didn't find out he was dead until two days later

The family of a war veteran say that they were denied the chance to say goodbye to him because his care home did not tell them that he was dying in hospital.

Malcolm Norris, 91, died from bronchial pneumonia five days after he was admitted to Hull Royal Infirmary earlier this month.

But his widow, 85-year-old Jean, daughter Andrea and her husband David Kerslake, were only informed that he had died when a bereavement worker at the hospital contacted Mrs Norris two days afterwards.

Care home owners Bupa say that they tried to contact Mrs Norris, who was on holiday in Wales with her daughter and son-in-law when he was admitted, using two contact numbers but were unsuccessful.

The family claim that the home also had contact details for Andrea and David Kerslake.

Mr Kerslake said: 'I can’t bear to think of him lying on his own with nobody to hold his hand.

'I feel they’ve taken that right away from us, to say goodbye.'

Mr Norris, a resident at the Bupa-run Saltshouse Haven care home in Hull, Yorkshire, was admitted to hospital on May 17.

Despite his family returning from their holiday the following day, they were still unaware that Mr Norris, who served in the Army for 12 years and fought in Egypt in the Second World War, had been taken from the home when he died on May 22.

His widow Jean found out the devastating news last Friday and when she checked her post later the same day had received two letters from Bupa.

One offered condolences on Mr Norris's death while the other was a bill for £616.02 for his final weeks in the £800 a month care home.

Daughter Andrea, 47, said: 'We took my mother with us to Abergavenny and we informed the care home we would be away.

'If we’d known anything was seriously wrong we would have been there.

“We live basically opposite the home - we could have been there in minutes and nobody contacted us at all.'

The family claim that Bupa had mobile numbers and landlines for both Andrea and her husband.

But Vivienne Birch, deputy regional director of Bupa Care Homes, said: 'The only two contact numbers we had for Mr Norris’s next of kin were for his wife.

Tragic: Mr Norris's son-in-law David Kerslake, pictured with Mrs Norris, said that he 'can't bear' to think of the 91-year-old having died in hospital alone

'When Mr Norris was admitted to hospital, we made a number of attempts to contact Mrs Norris. Unfortunately these calls were either unanswered or the number had been disconnected.

'We understand the hospital made similar attempts to contact Mrs Norris after her husband was admitted and, tragically, it appears these attempts were not successful until after Mr Norris’s death.'

She added: 'I would welcome the opportunity to meet Mrs Norris to discuss what happened.

'We are very sorry for the obvious distress she has been caused and we will review our procedures to ensure this does not happen again.'
