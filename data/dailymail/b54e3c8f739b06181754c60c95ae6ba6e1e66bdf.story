Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia clearly enjoyed their duel at The Open Championship so much they have decided to conduct an encore at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone.

The only difference this time is it’s the Northern Irishman who is doing the chasing as the Spaniard’s welcome revival continued.

On Friday, Garcia shot one of the rounds of the year, a stunning 61 featuring seven birdies to finish. It’s never easy coming back the next day after such a performance and particularly when the round is interrupted for more than three hours owing to a storm delay.

Out in front: Sergio Garcia extended his lead at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational to five shots on Saturday

Frustration: Weather suspended play as thunderstorms hit with Garcia having only played 15 holes

Get in the hole: The Spaniard is on 14-under-par having nearly completed his third round in Akron, Ohio

Form: Garcia has looked brilliant in America and looks poised to claim a rare European win in Ohio

That suspension actually proved a good
 one for McIlroy. Both players had just three holes to complete when it 
came, with Garcia a healthy five shots ahead.

But
 the lead is now a much more precarious three strokes after the Open 
Champion birdied his last two holes upon the resumption for a 66 to give
 the tournament an entirely different complexion and set up what 
promises to be an enthralling finale on Sunday.

There’s
 plenty at stake for McIlroy. If he wins he can become world number one 
again, but only if present incumbent Adam Scott finishes outside the top
 five. The Aussie just happens to be joint fourth after a 65 of his own 
and clearly has no intention of giving up his crown.

‘I’m
 playing really well so it promises to be an exciting day,’ said McIloy,
 who is a phenomenal 28 under par for his last seven rounds. ‘Sergio 
chased me down at Hoylake and now it’s my turn to chase him.’

Raindrops keep falling on my head: Rory McIlroy walks across the fairway with an umbrella

Challenger: McIlroy is second, five shots off the pace, and is looking to add to his Open Championship title

Weather: McIlroy (in the red trousers) walks across the bridge on the 16th hole as the tournament is delayed

Hopes: Englishman Justin Rose is six shots behind on eight-under-par as he searches for his third win in four

Alongside
 Scott and American Keegan Bradley at six off the pace is Justin Rose, 
meaning that four of the world’s top five are where they need to be on 
the leaderboard of the year. Even the one player missing, third-ranked 
Henrik Stenson, is not completely out of it in 8th place.

As
 for Garcia, if he could pull off his first WGC (World Golf 
Championship) win, it would be his 9th victory on the PGA tour, and 
would tie him with none other than Seve Ballesteros and Sir Nick Faldo 
for most wins by a European player since 1970.

Meanwhile,
 of the players on the fringe of a Ryder Cup place for both sides, only 
Bradley is really doing his cause a world of good. If there was any 
doubt he would get a wild card if he needs one, it has surely ended 
here.

Struggle: Defending champion Tiger Woods has yet to find his form an is 15 shots of the pace on one-over-par

Expletive: Woods was heard swearing at the cameras after a poor shoot on the sixth hole in Ohio

As for England’s 
struggling trio, Luke Donald, clinging on to the 9th  and last automatic
 spot as we enter the final month of qualifying, is well down the field 
and so will not be strengthening his grip, although he will be grateful 
that Scot Stephen Gallacher, presently 10th, is not taking advantage 
after three ordinary rounds of his own.

Lee
 Westwood came here desperate for a big week after missing four halfway 
cuts in a row but while he is trending in the right direction, rounds of
 72,71 and 70 have left him stranded in the middle of the pack.

Even
 worse off is Ian Poulter, whose disappointing year continues. Let’s 
hope a return to Valhalla for the USPGA Championship next week brings a 
shift of narrative. It was there in 2008 that a Ryder Cup career that 
has seen him win an incredible 11 of his last 12 matches really took 
off.

Desire: Woods needs to finish well in the next two tournaments if he hopes to qualify for the FedEx Cup
