As Sportsmail continues its 'HANDS OFF IN THE BOX' campaign in an attempt to rid the game of grappling defenders and shirt-pulling in the area, we highlight the main talking points from Everton's match against West Brom on Monday night.

 Everton 0-0 West Brom

While Everton's home clash was rather uneventful in terms of goal-mouth action, there were still a number of talking points from the game. 

After Kevin Mirallas' penalty miss in the first half for the Toffees, the hosts should have had another in the second half after a clear foul on Everton striker Steven Naismith.

The Scottish international appeared to be bundled down in the area by Baggies midfielder Claudio Yacob on 62 minutes.

What made the incident even more bizarre was the fact the 27-year-old had been previously warned twice by referee Michael Oliver about making contact in the area.

But despite those warnings he couldn't resist pulling back the forward again from the corner that followed, with Naismith falling into the West Brom goal - but no penalty was awarded.

Yacob proved to be a big part of a resilient West Brom display, with the visitors grinding out a hard-fought point at Goodison Park.

After the game manager Tony Pulis admitted the Argentina midfielder plays a similar role to that of Crystal Palace's midfield general Mile Jedinak - who starred under Pulis at Selhurst Park last season. 

Neither side could make the breakthrough, with the result much more pleasing for Baggies manager Pulis rather than Everton boss Roberto Martinez.
