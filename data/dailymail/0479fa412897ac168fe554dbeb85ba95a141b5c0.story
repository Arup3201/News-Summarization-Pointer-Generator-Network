Newcastle United have sounded out German coach Thomas Tuchel over their managerial vacancy but been told he does not wish to return to employment until next summer.

Tuchel, 41, built a reputation as one of Europe’s brightest young coaches by guiding Mainz to sustained high placings in the Bundesliga before stepping down, much to their dismay, in May.

He has been approached by Schalke, Hamburg, and Bayer Leverkusen in the past but is said to be determined to enjoy his break from the game to wait for the right opportunity.

Newcastle are understood to be long-term admirers and made tentative contact in light of Alan Pardew’s departure to Crystal Palace.

Tuchel will not join the club at this moment but a possibility opens up if John Carver, who has been placed in temporary charge, stays in place for the rest of the season. A move for Tuchel, who would work within Newcastle’s structure, could come off at that point.

Tuchel is renown for his innovative tactics and ability to improve players, with Andre Schurrle progressing hugely under him and Lewis Holtby enjoying a breakthrough loan spell at Mainz in 2010-11.

That season Mainz finished fifth, their highest ever league position, to qualify for the Europa League and Tuchel again guided the team into Europe last season before leaving.
