Lizzie Jennings, 54, has set up a free festive 'drunk tank' in the beer garden of her pub in Worcestershire

It is the time of year to eat, drink, and be merry, but many people who over-indulge can be faced with a dilemma over how to get home.

Except revellers at the Drum and Monkey in Worcestershire, who can simply sleep it off in one of eight tents which have been set up in the beer garden.

Landlady Lizzie Jennings, 54, is providing her punters with a free Christmas 'drunk tank' including luxury sleeping bags, foam mattresses, and even a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea when they wake up.

Lizzie - who has run the rural pub for eight months - said she came up with the idea for the mini campsite with regular and tent maker Daniel Walton, 37.

She said: 'We were talking about the Christmas period and drink driving and ways we could curb it this year.

'There was so much interest in paid-for drunk tanks earlier this year and we thought it was a good idea to offer customers a chance to put their heads down.

'But I wanted to offer my customers a free facility as it's the season of goodwill after all.

'Dan said he would lend me some tents, which was really nice of him.

'I'll even be offering my overnight guests a mug of hot tea and a bacon buttie the next morning before sending them on their way.

'We want people to come and have a good night and this way they can stop for an extra glass of wine if they want to.

Between December 3 and January 1 up to 19 drinkers who over-indulge can sleep in one of the eight tents which come with luxury sleeping bags, foam mattresses, and even a heater to keep warm

In the morning, after sleeping off the worst of it, Lizzie is even offering a bacon butty and a cup of tea to help people deal with the hangover

Lizzie came up with the idea with pub regular and tent-maker Daniel Walton who loaned her the tents for free

'We are cut off a little bit from public transport here so we hope this can deter people from getting in their cars after a few too many and keep themselves and others from harm.

'Most of the customers are farmers so they rely on driving, so we wouldn't want them to risk getting banned.

'This way people don't have to go far to get the experience of camping after a night out in a traditional British country pub.'

Daniel, who runs an online tent manufacturing business, has loaned eight of his tents to the drinking establishment for the Christmas period.

Ms Jennings, who has been in charge of the rural pub for eight months, explained that drink driving was a particular problem for her customers as the bar is cut off from most public transport

He said: 'Family and friends a can stay in their own tent, we have an eight berth, four berth and a six berth tent so there is a lot of room for everyone.

'The area is quite rural, so it does attract campers and walkers.

'We do have heaters in there and it is very warm, the tent is completely sealed and is very snug inside with pillows, sleeping bags and night-lights.

'I hope the idea will catch on - it will hopefully deter people from drink driving, which is always a problem this time of year.'

Punter Craig Walker, 30, added: 'It's like going camping with your mates except you don't have as far to stumble back to your tent in the dark after you've had a few - it's brilliant.'

Customers can stay in the tents at the pub for free between December 3 and January 1.
