England will play Test cricket at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua next year for the first time since the abandoned game in 2009.

Just 10 balls were bowled by West Indies in that Test, the second to be held at the venue, before it was called off due to an unsafe outfield caused by excess sand.

A game was subsequently held at short notice at the nearby Recreation Ground while the SVRS was banned from hosting international cricket for 12 months.

Leader: England captain Alastair Cook will take his side on a three-match tour to the West Indies in 2015

Explosive: England will face the likes of West Indies' star man Chris Gayle during their trip to the Caribbean

April 6-7: Two-day warm-up, St Kitts

April 8-9: Two-day warm-up, St Kitts

April 13-17: First Test, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua

April 21-25: Second Test, Grenada National Stadium, Grenada

May 1-5: Third Test, Kensington Oval, Barbados 

The ground staged its first Test since that embarrassment against New Zealand last year, while England returned for three one-day internationals in February and March.

It will now play home to the first of three Tests against England on April 13, followed by the tourists' maiden Test in Grenada and a series-ending trip to Barbados.

The itinerary represents a marked change from the West Indies Cricket Board's initial plans, which had included games in Guyana and Jamaica.

The omission of Barbados' Kensington Oval, a favoured stop off of the travelling Barmy Army, had seemed an eccentric decision and has been rectified after the matches were re-tendered by the WICB.

Paul Downton, managing director England cricket, said: 'We thank the West Indies Cricket Board for their assistance with the organisation of the tour and we know the venues will prove extremely popular with the thousands of cricket lovers who follow England to the Caribbean. It will also be exciting for many to visit the new venue of Grenada for the first time.'
