Two killers who carried out a 'cold 
blooded execution' to settle a gangland feud in the family of celebrity 
gangster Dave Courtney have each been jailed for a minimum of 31 years.

Genson Courtney, 22, the stepson of 
the author and bit part actor, was shot through the eye by uncle David 
Pinto, 33, and Robert Bleach, 45, outside his girlfriend's flat.

The victim had been threatening his 
uncle and Pinto decided to eliminate him first. Mr Courtney was gunned 
down outside his girlfriend's flat in Greenwich from a range of three 
feet.

It is believed that Pinto actually carried out the shooting and Bleach was the getaway driver.

The pair denied murder, but were convicted by the jury and ordered to serve a 31 year minimum sentence.

Jailing the pair today Judge 
Wendy Joseph said: 'The jury convicted you both of participating in what
can only be described as the execution of Genson Courtney.

'This was a deliberate and calculated plan to take the life of another person.

'The plan involved the carrying of a 
gun and ammunition in public to a densely populated area at a time of 
day when there could have been other people around.'

The court heard Genson Courtney was the son Jenny Pinto had before she married Dave Courtney.

Jennifer Courtney, the victim's mother and sister of Pinto, the man who killed his nephew

His stepfather has written several 
books about his life of crime with some of the legends of the underworld
and has had small parts in several films.

He called himself Dave Courtney OBE - 
and joked that the initials stood for 'One big ego.' But he was in 
financial difficulty at the time of the murder and as a result he had a 
fight with Genson.

The stepson had a long list of 
convictions and was jailed for six years for rape in 2006. Some of the 
jail time he served overlapped with his stepfather and they were allowed
to share a cell in Belmarsh.

Genson told his relative in prison he 
wanted to get physically bigger so he could rob drug dealers when he got
out in January 2011.

He was making £1,000 a week dealing 
drugs at the time of his death and had many enemies. Mr Courtney was 
also training every day at his local gym and had bulked up his body 
massively with steroids before he died.

Three weeks before the murder he 
argued with his stepfather about Dave Courtney's plan to build another 
house in his back garden so that he would have somewhere to live if his 
home was repossessed.

Location: Jonathan Rees, QC, prosecuting, said Mr Courtney was shot as he was getting into his car outside his girlfriend's flat in Banning Street, Greenwich

The pair decided to settle their differences on Plumstead Common, south-east London. After being battered to the ground by his stepson, Dave joked: 'Let's call it a draw.'

Genson Courtney also bore grudges against his uncle, who was wary of him because of the thrashing he had handed out to Dave Courtney.

He was still angry with Pinto because he had thrashed him in front of his friends for playing truant as a child.

Pinto had also taken some of Genson's belongings and pawned them to pay off a £1,100 debt the victim owed.

The victim, who suffered from 'roid rage' believed Pinto was hiding from him and sent him a series of abusive texts before he died.

Genson Courtney had left his girlfriend's flat and was going to sell drugs when he was shot at point blank rage in Banning Street, Greenwich on July 3, 2011.

'The shooting had the hallmarks of a coldblooded execution,' said prosecutor Jonathan Rees.

'The evidence suggests the gunman was lying in wait for Mr Courtney as he left his girlfriend's flat to get into her car which was parked on the road outside.

'The gunman managed to get very close to his target and fired only one shot to the head - it seems that a getaway car was waiting nearby.'

He added: 'Genson Courtney was looking to settle various scores he had with Uncle David.

'Against this background the prosecution suggest that the motive behind the killing was that David Pinto was concerned that Genson Courtney was after him and sought to eliminate the threat he posed.'

The evidence against the two men was purely circumstantial and the prosecution relied on mobile phone contacts put them in the area.

Pinto, of Greenwich, and Bleach, of Greenwich, both denied murder. They showed no trace of emotion as they were sentenced via a court video link from jail.
