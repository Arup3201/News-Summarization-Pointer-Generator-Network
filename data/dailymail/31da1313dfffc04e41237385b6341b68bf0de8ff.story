The U.S. Navy has sold the nation's first ever 'supercarrier,' USS Forrestal, for a mere penny.

The decommissioned aircraft carrier, aboard which 134 sailors died in a series of explosions and a massive fire in 1967, was snapped up for the bargain price by Texas company All Star Metals.

All 1,067 foot of the ship will be dismantled, scrapped and recycled once it is towed from the Navy's inactive ship facility in Philadelphia to the company's facility in Texas later this year, the Navy announced.

According to Fox News, more than 16,000 engineers, draftsmen and builders worked on the ship which cost an estimated $217 million - or $2 billion in today's dollars - to build. It launched on December 11, 1954.

The ship - named after the former Navy secretary and the first U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal - was in the Gulf of Tonkin for the Vietnam War effort.

On the morning of July 29, 1967, a stray voltage triggered a rocket to launch from an F-4 Phantom on the flight deck and struck an armed A-4 Skyhawk - piloted by a young Lt. Cmdr. John S. McCain III.

The rocket ruptured the fuel tanks of
the plane, sparking a chain reaction of fires and explosions on the 
deck, which was full of fueled up, parked aircrafts.

The crew fought the blaze on the flight deck for an hour, but other fires continued into the next day.

In
the aftermath, 134 men were killed and more than 300 injured. The ship 
was heavily damaged, and more than 26 aircraft were destroyed and 
another 30 damaged.

The devastating fire, however, prompted changes to the way the Navy handles damage control and helped improve disaster training.

It
took seven months of repairs in the shipyard before the supercarrier 
was fit to return to sea, where it remained for two more decades.

However, the ship's rich history and nearly four decades of service are not enough to save it.

After it was decommissioned on September 11, 1993 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, the Navy tried to donate the historic aircraft carrier for use as a memorial or a museum, but no 'viable applications' were received.

'It's something that the Navy is caught between a rock and a hard place,' historian for the USS Forrestal Association and a survivor of the 1967 incident Ken Killmeyer said, according to Fox News.

'They have to have these vessels no matter how big or small they are, and they use them as you would your car until theyâ€™re no longer financially viable. So, they decommission them.'
