Nigel Farage met Rupert Murdoch in his New York offices after filming interviews for some of the mogul's news channels, it has been revealed.

The Ukip leader was summoned to Murdoch's NewsCorp Manhattan office after taping a segment for Fox News's Sean Hannity and Neil Cavuto shows.

During an advertisement break, Cavuto turned to Farage and said: 'Sir, the boss wants to see you... the big boss,' it was reported.

Nigel Farage, pictured in Edinburgh today, had a 'private conversation' with Rupert Murdoch after being called up to the media mogul's Manhattan office 

Mr Murdoch's publications have been known to heavily endorse political parties, with the front page of The Sun condemning candidates such as Labour's Neil Kinnock in the 1992 General Election with a headline of: 'If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights.'

Breitbart London reports the leader was whisked upstairs for 'lengthy' talks following the brief exchange. 

The meeting comes after Douglas Carswell announced his leaving the Tories for UKIP, triggering a by-election in Clacton where he may become the first elected Ukip MP.

A Ukip spokesman confirmed the encounter, describing it as a 'private conversation' between the two,'The Independent reports.

In 2013 the outspoken party leader praised Mr Murdoch - whose many publications were heavily scrutinised in the wake of the phone hacking scandal - as a 'remarkable bloke' after being invited to his home for dinner. 

Rupert Murdoch's  publications have famously endorsed and condemned political parties in the past 

Earlier this week pro-union campaigners begged Farage to stay away from Scotland ahead of the impending referendum. 

Plans for a rally on September  12 - six days before the historic vote - were met frostily by some who fear his presence in Glasgow will deter Labour enthusiasts from voting against Scottish independence.

Last night, Murdo Fraser, a Tory member of the Scottish Parliament, said: ‘I think it would be best if Nigel Farage stayed as far away from Scotland as possible. 

'The arguments for staying in the UK are strong. The majority of Scots are on our side and we don’t need a distraction at this point.’

But Ukip’s Scottish chairman, Arthur Thackeray, dismissed calls for Mr Farage to stay away as ‘absolute, complete and utter nonsense’.

 He said: ‘We are a mainstream party and Nigel as our leader is coming up in support of a No vote.’
