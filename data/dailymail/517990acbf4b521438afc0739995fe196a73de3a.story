Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola should be wary about resting some of his star players for Wednesday's Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow, according to Matthias Sammer.

The Bavarians sporting director - who made 115 appearances for Borussia Dortmund during his playing career - is unsure as to whether Guardiola should rest several first-team players despite Bayern's progress to the knockout stages already guaranteed.

The Bundesliga champions won their first four Group E matches to ensure qualification to the last 16 before losing to Man City two weeks ago.

With CSKA desperate for a victory to ensure their own progression, Sammer believes should Guardiola choose to rest some of Bayern's star men, it could have an adverse affect on the team in the long run.

'I do not know [if it would be a good idea to rotate,' Sammer said speaking to TZ. 'On the other hand: yes. On the other hand: no.

'Because it is a risk that we could lose our momentum again when we leave six or seven first-team players out of the line-up.

'Under Pep there is a good attitude in the squad. He knows how important it is to keep momentum going.

'We want to again play a good game,' the forward said. 'We're aiming for a victory on home soil.'
