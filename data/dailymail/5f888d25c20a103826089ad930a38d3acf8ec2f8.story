This family of wedding crashers risked the wrath of the bride to capture these photos.

Brandi and Randy Russell, and their two children, take to the beach in tropical Hawaii to snap photobombing shots with unsuspecting wedding parties who have forked out thousands on the dream ceremonies.

The family-of-four, originally from Lenexa in Kansas, lived on the idyllic island for five years and decided to take their quirky photos at the Ko Olina beach lagoon.

Smitten couples loved the beauty spot so much that they flocked there almost hourly, giving the family the idea that they could make their way into wedding albums back in 2004.

Pediatric occupational therapist Brandi, 36, said: 'It was so frequent it was comical.

'I remember a specific conversation one day, when my husband and I wondered, "How many random people's wedding photos are we in the background in our bathing suits?".

'From there, it was a dare to go get in that wedding photo.'

Brandi and Randy, 38, as well as kids Kyler, eight and Elle, six, have since turned the hobby into a family tradition.

But they have been met with some resistance from happy couples and guests. Brandi said: 'We quickly realised actually photobombing wasn't cool.

'The wedding co-ordinators would shoo us away or we would get scowls from the bridal party. 

'It's not our style to be rude. So, we started taking pics of ourselves with the wedding in the background. It was way less invasive and still fun.'

The family ditched their desperate clambering to get in the background of the pictures to take centre stage.

They have since posed behind trees, made love hearts out of hands and even danced while in full view of wedding parties.

Brandi said: 'It was a game we played only on vacation but now we include our kids in the fun and whoever else wants to play.

'This year, we are vacationing in Hawaii with my parents and we have enlisted my mum and dad as official beach wedding photo bomb paparazzi.

'We all start cheering and hi-fiving when we see a white gown and an entourage of bridesmaids on the beach. It is fun to figure out the silliest pose or best angle for our picture.'

Now they no longer 'photo-bomb' but take pictures near the couples
