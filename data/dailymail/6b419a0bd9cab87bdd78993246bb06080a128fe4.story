A major Canadian pension fund is close to finalising a deal to buy out Burton's Biscuit Company, the makers of biscuit tin favourites Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels.

The Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan is expected to buy out the firm, with the deal expected to be sealed in the coming hours.

Bidding for the company, which also makes Maryland Cookies, closed on Thursday, after owners the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, private equity group Apollo 
Global Management, and Duke Street Capital, put it up for sale in 
August.

Sky News has cited unnamed sources who claim the sale is close to going through, however, it was still possible that another bidder could make an improved last-minute offer.

The Canadian pension fund - which manages assets worth C$127.3 billion (75.6 billion pounds)- has bought several British companies in recent years, acquiring the nursery chain Busy Bees in October and National Lottery operator Camelot, which was bought in 2010.

Warburg Pincus WP.UL, Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Apax Partners have all put in rival bids to buy the brand.

Potential: If the deal goes through, it could herald an offer from the Canadian fund to buy the larger United Biscuits, which produces brands McVitie's, Jaffa Cakes and Jacob's

Burton's is the second-largest biscuit manufacturer in the UK, reporting a revenue of Â£342m in 2011.

If the deal goes through, it could herald a potential offer from the Canadian fund to buy the larger United Biscuits, which produces brands  McVitie's, Jaffa Cakes and Jacob's.

United was bought by two private equity firms for 1.6 billion pounds in 2006.

Neither Burton's Biscuits nor the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan were available for comment.
