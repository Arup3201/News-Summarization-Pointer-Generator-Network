Hatem Ben Arfa could retire from football after being denied permission to play for Nice this season, his lawyer has told French radio station RMC.

FIFA ruled earlier this month that the 27-year-old cannot appear for the Ligue 1 club because he has already turned out for Hull City – during a loan spell – and Newcastle Under-21s, which was classed as an official fixture.

Rules state that a player can be registered with three clubs in any one season but can only play for two of those – emergency loans apart. 

Hatem Ben Arfa is set to leave Nice after being told he could not play for them until next season

The former Newcastle United midfielder was released from his contract at St James' Park

Ben Arfa – who was released by Newcastle before signing for Nice earlier this month - is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday regarding his future.

However, Sportsmail understands that a move to MLS remains a possibility for Ben Arfa given that their 2015 season starts in March. 

FIFA regulations state that 'players may be registered with a maximum of three clubs during one season. During this period, the player is only eligible to play official matches for two clubs'. 

The Ligue 1 side had attempted to appeal against the ruling, but the Nice Administrative Court upheld FIFA's original decision, according to France Football.  

He is now eligible to play for Newcastle and Hull before the end of the season.  

The 27-year-old has experienced disciplinary issues at each of his past four clubs in England and France

On Sunday Ben Arfa admitted his frustration over the stalled move on Nice's website.

'I do not understand why they would try to stop me from playing in France, my home, and say I should be in England or somewhere else,' he said. 'Why always try to create problems when there are none?

'I have only one desire - to play again on the pitches of Ligue 1, to have fun with my team-mates, and to give pleasure to the fans who have welcomed me as ever.'

For Ben Arfa, it's a frustrating conclusion to what's been a difficult season. He began the campaign frozen out at Newcastle, before a loan switch to Hull in which he managed just nine appearances.
