Enabled: Confessed serial killer Israel Keyes was given a razor blade in his Alaska jail cell allowing him to commit suicide in December it's been revealed

A razor blade was mistakenly issued to confessed serial killer Israel Keyes in his jail cell allowing him to slash his wrists and commit suicide, the Alaska Department of Corrections has admitted.

Keyes was found dead in his cell on Dec. 2, months before he was to have gone on trial for the 2012 slaying of 18-year-old Anchorage barista Samantha Koenig.

The razor was never found.

Outraged by this latest report, Ms Koenig’s family are calling the security lapse no mistake after only three months earlier Keyes, believed responsible for at least eight murders across the U.S., was found possessing an object modified into a handcuff key.

That discovery heightened Keyes’ 
security, segregating him from other inmates and subjecting him to daily
strip searches and cell searches.

‘I
don’t think it was mistaken at all,’ Ms Koenig’s father James Koenig 
angrily reacted to Keyes’ supplied razor. ‘How do you mistakenly give 
someone in segregation a real razor blade?’

He
accuses the Corrections Department of robbing his family of their day 
in court, on Wednesday saying he doesn’t believe the official version 
released by the agency.

Keyes
slit his left wrist with a razor blade and tied a noose around his neck
and right foot, according to the Correction’s report, which says the 
exact cause of death is unknown although it has been classified as a 
suicide.

Justice: Family of 18-year-old Samantha Koenig who was abducted from a coffee shop, raped and murdered by Keyes, he has admitted, say he wrongly escaped justice through his own suicide

The state had previously denied an open records request from The Associated Press for details of events surrounding Keyes’ death. Corrections spokeswoman Kaci Schroeder told the AP that officials later decided to take another look at the case and see what could be released publicly.

Schroeder said officials are not discussing what disciplinary actions, if any, were taken, over the lapse. However, she said because of this, any restriction for inmates are being posted on the cell doors in addition to being noted in a prisoner log.

Before he died, Keyes told investigators he had killed Koenig and at least seven other people across the country, including Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vt. Investigators believe there could be more victims.

Keyes was set for a March trial in federal court in the abduction and killing of Koenig.

Authorities aren't certain when Keyes' crime spree began or ended. But they have a haunting image of his last known victim.

Snippets of a surveillance video show the first terrifying moments of Koenig's abduction.

Keyes is seen as a shadowy figure in ski mask and hood outside Common Grounds, a tiny Anchorage coffee shack then partially concealed from a busy six-lane highway by mountains of snow.

It's February 1, 2012, about 8pm, closing time. Koenig is shown handing Keyes a cup of coffee, then backing away with her hands up, as if it's a robbery.

The lights go out and Keyes next appears as a fuzzy image climbing through the drive-thru window.Authorities outlined his next steps:

Monster: After Keyes killed Koenig he sent her family a picture of her body that made them believe she was still alive if they sent him ransom money

Keyes forced Koenig to his Silverado; he'd already bound her hands with zip ties and gagged her.

He hid her in a shed outside his house, turned on loud music so no one could hear if she screamed, then returned to the coffee shack to retrieve scraps of the restraints and get her phone.

On February 2, Keyes raped and strangled Koenig. He left her in that shed, flew to Houston and embarked on a cruise, returning about two weeks later.

He then took a photo of Koenig's body holding a February13 newspaper to make it appear she was alive.

Keyes wrote a ransom note on the back, demanding $30,000 be placed in her account. He texted a message, directing the family to a dog park where the note could be found. Her family deposited some money from a reward fund.

The abduction gripped Anchorage as investigators held out hope that she remained alive.

Keyes was arrested in March in Lufkin, Texas. He had sought a ransom and used Koenig’s debit card throughout his travel across country.

Three weeks after the arrest, Koenig’s dismembered body was found in a frozen lake north of Anchorage.

Koenig and the Curriers were the only victims named by Keyes.

Keyes was in state custody in Anchorage because there are no federal prisons in Alaska.

But as those who knew Keyes revealed, his secret double-life was never once hinted at or revealed by him.

‘I never got any bad, weird, scary, odd vibe from him in any way, shape or form,’ says Paul Adelman, an Anchorage attorney who first hired Keyes as a handyman in 2008.

Keyes' live-in girlfriend also was floored to learn of his double life, according to David Kanters, her friend. ‘He had everyone fooled,’ Kanters told The Associated Press in an email.

‘THAT is the scary part. He came across as a nice normal guy.’ (She did not respond to numerous requests for comment.)

Shock: Family and friends of Keyes say there was nothing to lead them to believe he had such a secretive second life as a self-admitted serial killer

The corrections report says Keyes was last seen alive at 10:13 p.m. on Dec. 1.

A number of security checks were conducted periodically throughout the night and early morning.

Security officers are required to look into each cell and verify the prisoner is present and their status, the report says.

‘Procedures
call for security staff to visually observe the prisoner’s uncovered 
skin. Keyes’ death was not observed during those security checks,’ the 
report says.

At 5:57 
a.m., Dec. 2, an official found what appeared to be blood along Keyes’ 
bunk and floor. The report says this was only noticed after lights came 
on; before that, an LED nightlight in the overhead fixture was the only 
light source.

Medical personnel were called, and Keyes was declared dead at 6:13 a.m.

Keyes attempted to escape from the federal courthouse on May 23, 2012. After that, enhanced security measures were used on Keyes, including full restraints, a two-officer escort any time he was out of the cell, and restrictions on possession of razors and pencils.

He also was subjected to daily strip searches and cell searches.

On Sept. 11, the report says, Keyes was found guilty of possessing an object which had been modified as a handcuff key.

A disciplinary board found him guilty, and he had to serve 60 days — with 45 days suspended — in punitive segregation.

That sentence began Nov. 28, and his access to personal property was restricted.
