A woman lost six stone in seven months after being told she might never have children because of her weight.

Siobhann O’Brien, 23, started her weight-loss campaign after doctors warned her that her weight could affect her chances of becoming pregnant.

The receptionist, from Failsworth, Oldham, had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome when she was 16 and piled on the weight, reaching 19st 10lb at her heaviest.

The sensible way: Siobhann O'Brien lost more than 6st in seven months by going to the gym and eating more healthily. She was warned to lose weight or risk infertility and has managed to do it without any faddy diets

Motivated by the doctor's warning, Siobhann joined her local gym seven months ago and enlisted the help of personal trainer Lee Greenall to help her shift the weight.

She said: 'At my first weigh-in, I was horrified to see 19st 10lb on the scales with 48 per cent body fat.

'I’ve been on and off diets all my life but never really stuck to anything but this time I was a lot more determined.'

She said: 'Lee put me on a full diet plan and even went shopping with me to educate me on the right foods to eat so I could implement this into my life. It’s all about being sensible and a lot of hard work.

'When I 
first started out, I couldn’t even step up and down on a box without 
getting tired. Sometimes I felt like crying and giving up and thought my
 body was shutting down. But I’m amazed at what I can do now and feel 
great when I come out.

'With determination and encouragement, I managed to push on resulting in a massive transformation in my life.'

At her heaviest: Siobhann, who weighed 19st 10lb and had a 48 per cent body fat, was warned by doctors that she might not be able to conceive if she didn't lose weight

Helping hand: She enlisted the help of personal trainer Lee, who put her on a full diet plan and even went shopping with her to educate her on the right foods to eat

Siobhann, who now weighs 13st 10lb, has lost 13in off her stomach, 9in off her hips and 12.5in from her legs.

She added:
 'I feel like a new person. Everyone has been so motivating and I’ve 
been looking back over pictures on Facebook and Instagram and can’t 
believe the change.

'All my friends and family are really impressed with the results and some people don't recognise me.

'There is no miracle cure. For anyone who is unhappy, there is only one answer. You can’t kid yourself. It’s not easy but it does actually work.'

Her personal trainer Lee Greenall added: 'It’s been terrific to see Siobhann’s change.

'Her
 courage and will is inspiring and she’s a testament to what hard work 
and commitment can result in. It has been a pleasure to work with her.'

Time to act: Siobhann said she had been on and off diets all of her life but never really stuck to anything but the doctor's warning was enough to motivate her

As she was: Siobhann, pictured on holiday at her heaviest, says that with determination and encouragement, she managed to push on and change her life
