For most people, a trip to the zoo is an occasional treat.

But when little Muriel Thatcher first paid a visit, back in 1937, the thrill was such that she's been going back to the same one every two weeks ever since... clocking up more than 2,000 trips.

Now, after seven decades of visiting Dudley Zoo, in the West Midlands, 87-year-old Muriel has been given a life membership to what she calls her 'second home'.

Muriel Thatcher, 87, from Wolverhampton, has visited her favourite zoo more than 2,000 times over the past seven decades

Muriel (pictured left in the 1930s) has been given a life membership to Dudley Zoo, in the West Midlands after going there every two weeks over 77 years

After her first visit aged 10, on the day it opened, Muriel fell in love with the zoo and went as often as she could as a teenager, scraping together any cash she could get hands on to pay for her admission

No doubt Muriel will be glad about that as the daily admission price for her would have been £11.50.

During a recent ceremony, staff at the zoo also presented her with her own bench (engraved in her honour) next to the monkey enclosure, along with a knapsack containing a thermos and packet of biscuits.

The animal-loving pensioner, from Wolverhampton, said: 'When I heard that a zoo was opening, I begged my mum that she would take me and my younger sister. My first ever visit was just magical. I had never seen exotic animals.

'On the opening day, we waited for hours upon end as queues to get in snaked around the block and my mum wanted to give up and go home, but I begged her to stay.

'When we got in, it was worth every minute that we waited and I felt like I was taken to another world.'

Muriel, who catches two buses and makes a three-hour round trip to the zoo, has even adopted 23 of the animals

Muriel said: 'Visiting the zoo during the war was a bit of a challenge, as everyone had to concentrate on the war effort.

'Adding to that, the zoo had irregular opening hours because of air raid scares and the blackouts.

'Nevertheless, I still tried to go as much as possible and I used to take any food scraps for the animals, as food was scarce for humans let alone animals - and so I felt sorry for them.'

The pensioner - who has never married nor has any children - catches two buses and makes a three-hour
 round trip to the zoo, and has even adopted 23 of the animals.

The former auxiliary nurse said her favourite animal are the tigers.

She said: 'I was lucky enough to even be invited to a special audience to watch one of the tigers, Sarah, give birth to her cubs.

'The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes and it was such an amazing spectacle.'

Muriel
 knows all of the staff well, saying: 'They do treat me very well and 
they let me hold some of the smaller animals whenever I go.

'They
 will send a car for me if there is a function but I don't like all the 
fuss and would even go if I had to walk all the way there.'

As one of the zoo's very first customers and certainly being its most loyal, Muriel said she has seen a lot of changes and has some great memories.

She said: 'I particularly hold fond in my heart memories from the great summer of 1969. The atmosphere at the zoo was so electric and everyone had a blast.

'Everyone was happy because of the glorious weather and people were eating ice cream after ice cream to keep cool.

'Even the elephants who are used to high heats were having to be constantly cooled down with big buckets of water.

'Now that I'm saving on an annual pass, I'll be able to spend more money on treats for my favourite animals,' said the pensioner

Muriel said: 'I just love Dudley Zoo, it's a very special place for me and I never tire of it'

Peter Suddock, CEO of Dudley Zoo, said: 'Muriel has been a season ticket holder for more years than she cares to remember and paid her first visit to the zoo as a ten-year-old schoolgirl, with her father and sister in 1937.

'She visits at least twice a month, regardless of the weather, and has been with us constantly throughout the good and bad times.

'Over the years, she has adopted many animals within the collection and knows all the members of staff on the keeping sections and offers encouragement and support in their projects.

'We often joke that Muriel knows more about the zoo than we do.'

Muriel said: 'I just love Dudley Zoo, it's a very special place for me and I never tire of it.

'I cannot imagine life without the zoo - the staff are like family and it's the most magical place.'
