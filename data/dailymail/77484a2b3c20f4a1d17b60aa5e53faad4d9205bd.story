Arrested: Medics at Franklin Medical Centre in Winnsboro, Louisiana, called police when Lasasha Allen brought her toddler to them with severe injuries

A mother has been charged with the attempted murder of her own child for allegedly throwing the 20-month-old out of a moving car as sped down a rural road at 45mph.

Medics at Franklin Medical Centre in Winnsboro, Louisiana, called police when Lasasha Allen brought the toddler to them suffering severe injuries.

The 23-year-old mother of six was arrested and, after investigations, police said they believe she inflicted the injuries on the child in a bid to get its father's attention.

Franklin Parish Sheriff Kevin Cobb told myarklamiss.com: 'It was finally determined that this was more than an accident. This was an intentional act.'

Police said Allen on Sunday sat her child in the front passenger seat of her car, with no seatbelt, and drove to a remote spot close to her home with a curve in the road.

With another of her children, a seven-year-old, watching from the back, she is said to have then sped along the curved road before reaching over, opening the door, and allowing the toddler to fall out.

She then waited several hours before taking the toddler to hospital. Police said she told them she only intended to inflict a few cuts and bruises.

Doctors found the toddler had a fractured skull and several broken bones. They arranged for an airlift to Louisiana State University Hospital in Shreveport where surgeons were waiting to operate.

The toddler was 'doing okay', Sheriff Cobb told KFOR.com yesterday.

Sheriff Cobb told KATC.com that on Saturday, the day before the incident, Allen had tried get the attention of the toddler's father by sending him a text message claiming his child had fallen from a car window.

After that text failed to provoke a response, she 'staged' the accident in an out-of-the-way spot on LA 865 to avoid being 'caught in a lie' with the child's father, the sheriff said.

He told KFOR: 'She decided that she would take the child for a ride, placed the child in the passenger seat on the very edge of the vehicle, unrestrained.

'She reached over and opened the vehicle door, in which the child was basically slung out of the vehicle.'

Sick ruse: Allen had told the child's father that the toddler had fallen from a car window and, when that failed to provoke a response, she 'staged' the accident on LA 865 to avoid being 'caught in a lie', the sheriff said

Allen is in custody at Franklin Parish Detention Centre, held on a $750,000 bond. Her other five children have been taken into care.

Sheriff Cobb called the allegations a 'horrendous act' that is 'beyond explanation.'

'I hope that everyone will pray for that child and its siblings through this ordeal,' he told KATC.

'One thing is certain, the child is in a safer place today than in the hands of the mother. Justice can't move quickly enough in this.'
