Google has confirmed rumours it will soon be offering mobile network plans. 

Vice president Sundar Pichai said the firm is working with unnamed operators during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. 

Rumours claim it will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah. 

Elsewhere, Mr Pichai confirmed Google was working on Android Pay as well as Project Loon, designed to connect more urban areas.

Google has confirmed year-long rumours it will be offering mobile network plans in the US.

Speaking at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, vice president Sundar Pichai said the tech giant is working with unnamed network operators on developing a cellular plan.

‘You will see us announce it in the coming months, I think we are at a stage where it is important to think about hardware, software and connectability together,’ said the 43-year-old.

Mr PIchai also confirmed rumours that Google is working on a payment service and unveiled plans for its Project Loon - designed to connect urban areas.

The rumours of a Google mobile network plan first emerged in April last year, and the unnamed networks are believed to be Sprint and T-Mobile in the US.

Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing 3G and 4G networks at wholesale prices and sell the connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate.

This would make Google a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) similar to Lycamobile in the US that runs on T-Mobile’s network, and Tesco Mobile in the UK which shares O2’s networks.

MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices.

The company can then use these network to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate.

Mr Pinchai said: ‘We want to be able to experiment along those lines, [but] we don't intend to be a network operator at scale.’

A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks.

MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices.

The company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate.

Lycamobile in the U.S, for example, is an MVNO because it runs on T-Mobile’s network.

In the UK, Tesco Mobile shares O2’s, and ultimately Telefonica’s, networks.

An MVNO is typically run as an independent company, with its own staff and customer service 

He described the plans as a ‘project’ and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks.

In particular, Mr Pichai said the setup should provide at seamless connection between Wi-Fi and mobile networks.

Sources said at the time of the original rumours that any Google-branded mobile network would initially launch in cities that have Google Fiber.

Google launched its 1000mps Fiber broadband service in 2011, starting with Kansas City.

In 2013, the firm announced it was expanding the service to Austin in Texas, Provo in Utah and a number of other towns in Missouri and California.

More locations are due to be added later this year, but the roll-out is slow because Google has to install the relevant infrastructure needed.

Google Fiber starts at $70 (£42) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices.

Google’s wireless plans would remove some of the costs, and time spent, in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well-connected networks.

This could help Google cement itself as an internet service provider.

Google could additionally use the network to sell its Nexus range of phones, for example, with contract or service plans.

Mr Pichai also used the event to announce the launch of Google Fiber in more urban areas and to announce Project Loon, designed to bring connectivity to rural areas, and Project Titan - a drone version of Loon.

He also confirmed Android Pay will be built into its mobile software and will have NFC components, but won’t launch it before Samsung launches its Pay service later this year.
