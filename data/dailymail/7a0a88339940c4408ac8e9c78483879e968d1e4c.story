Prince Harry has described how he was
 reduced to tears by the moving stories of young Brazilian children who 
have lost a parent to drugs, violence or prison.

The prince also told how he wanted to
 share his experience of losing his mother after being told about two 
sisters being cared for by their grandmother as their drug-dealing 
father was in jail and their mother had been murdered.

Harry met the sisters and their 
grandmother on Wednesday during a visit to Acer - the Association for 
Support of Children at Risk 
to help underprivileged children in Diadema near Sao Paulo.

Moved: Speaking at a reception to mark the Queen's official birthday, Prince Harry said he had been moved to tears by many of the children's tales

In a speech at a reception late last 
night in Sao Paulo to mark the Queen’s official birthday Harry said: 
'Some of the children’s stories in Diadema have reduced me to tears, but
 the smiles on their faces show the positive impact their community is 
having on them and the success of Acer.'

During his visit to Acer Harry 
learned how Cristina da Cruz Nascimento has struggled to bring up her 
granddaughters Karina, eight, and Carolina, nine, and is also caring for
 her great niece Kettelyn, three, because her mother is a drug addict in
 Sao Paulo’s infamous Cracolandia - 'Crackland'.

Harry
 said after meeting the family: 'There are two little girls - I'm quite 
emotional - just looking at them I wanted to talk about my own 
experiences. But there is no point because it is just so far removed.'

Raise a glass: Prince Harry (L) toasts next to Alexander Ellis, British ambassador of Brazil at an event following his visit to Acer, where he learned of the children's sad tales

While he rarely speaks about the tragic loss of his mother, Princess Diana, he added: 'The 
bravery of them looking at me, smiling at me... I wanted to use my own 
experiences in a very small way to try to give them a bit of 
understanding about the fact (that) I see what you're going through.

'But you hear the stories and think that's nothing to what they have been through.'

The prince 
met the sisters and their grandmother during his visit to Acer - the 
Association for Support of Children at Risk - a project run by Briton 
Jonathan Hannay.

Mr Hannay, son of the diplomat Sir David 
Hannay, said he founded Acer in 1993 after first working with children 
while a student at Columbia University in New York in 1990.

Encounter: Prince Harry meets Brazilian TV personality Sabrina Sato at the Sao Paulo reception

Celebrity: Ms Sato, who has appeared in the Brazilian version of Playboy magazine, wore a cream dress and towering Christian Louboutin heels as she chatted with the prince

Invitation: Harry chats to Ms Sato, who said she had invited the prince to attend the city's carnival in February

One of its projects is to help children with no parents by reuniting them with members of their extended family.

After
 the visit Harry said: 'I was completely overwhelmed and shocked. I've 
never blubbed in public as far as I can remember but I was pretty damn 
close. It was amazing to hear those stories.'

The prince will visit the notorious area later today as his tour of Brazil comes to an end.

Harry will tour the area with the 
Mayor of Sao Paulo, Fernando Haddad, and the Chief Inspector of the 
Metropolitan Police, who will explain how they have adopted a policy of 
providing housing, food and work for addicts in a bid to tackle the drug
 problem.

Harry’s final engagement will take 
him to the Ayrton Senna Institute where members of the former Formula 
One racing driver’s family will show him around the organisation that 
uses education to fight social exclusion and inequality. 

Sharing his experience: The prince also told how he wanted to share his experience of losing his mother after hearing tales of young girls being raised by their grandmother

After spending a day playing soccer 
with underprivileged children and planting trees in the rainforest, 
Prince Harry's tour of Brazil ventured back to the city of Sao Paulo 
where he hobnobbed at a party in honor of his grandmother Queen 
Elizabeth II's official birthday last night.

Though the Queen's actually birthday 
is in April, the official celebration takes place every year on a 
Saturday in June. This year's official celebration took place on June 
14, and British Ambassador to Brazil Alex Ellis decided to continue the 
celebrations during Harry's visit to the country this week.

The
 reception held at the British Consulate was attended by such 
dignitaries as mayor of Sao Paulo Fernando Haddad as well as Brazilian 
celebrities like Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio and television personality Sabrina Sato, 33.

Ms Sato, who has appeared in the Brazilian version of Playboy magazine, wore a cream dress and towering Christian Louboutin heels as she chatted with the prince.

Prince
 Harry also got to meet Sao Paulo's oldest British community member, 
102-year-old Gertrude Viger, and he was even picked kicking around a 
soccer ball in the reception hall.

Earlier on yesterday, the prince visited the jungle to support a conservation project.

Dressed in blue jeans and a grey shirt, the prince, 29, visited the Atlantic Rainforest that surrounds the city of São Paulo to learn about their efforts to preserve the eco system.

The forest
 has been described as an extraordinary cultural and historical resource
 with hundreds of trees and thousands of plant species.

An
 initiative led by the Brazilian government is trying to re-house some 
communities that live in the area to help protect the rainforest and 
allow new saplings to be planted.

Harry wasn't afraid to get stuck in and helped plant some trees himself, working up a sweat in the humid environment.

When
 he was asked if he was enjoying himself, he joked about life as a royal
 saying with a wry smile: 'Planting trees - it's what we do.'

Harry
 was helping residents from the settlement of Cota, located within the 
Atlantic rainforest on a steep hill overlooking the port of Santos, 
plant trees to replace those lost due to urban development and to 
protect the homes from mudslides.

He was then rewarded for his efforts with the chance to try some Brazilian cuisine. He joined Brazilian chef David Hertz, who runs a not for profit organisation that uses cooking to improve the lives of disadvantaged people, at a cooking demonstration.
