A Russian airline UTair
 Boeing 737 plane, carrying 78 passengers plus crew,
has requested an emergency landing at the Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg, the company and a Russian aviation source said on
Wednesday.

The source said one of the plane's engines had failed and
that the plane had been due to land at 12:25 pm (0925 GMT).

The emergency landing was carried out 'after the transmitter went off, signalling the right engine's failure', a source told RIA Novosti news agency.

Russia's Emergencies Ministry said it could not immediately
comment.
