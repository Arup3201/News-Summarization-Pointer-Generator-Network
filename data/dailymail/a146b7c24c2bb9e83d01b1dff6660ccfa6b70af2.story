There are certain, unavoidable signs of a centre forward lost in a haze of low confidence and Robert Lewandowski exhibited them in spades on Wednesday night.

Heavy first touches, weak finishing, failure to get the head up and utilise peripheral vision. You could easily have put the Bayern striker’s name all the way down the checklist.

It can be painful to watch, whoever you support. Down the other end of the field, Manchester City’s Edin Dzeko must have looked on and winced.

He knows what it feels like to see the goal shrink to the size of a waste paper bin but the Bosnian also knows what it’s like to come out of the other side of a confidence crisis. Dzeko survived his own issues at Manchester City and surely Lewandowski will survive his own here in Bavaria.

With Dzeko – who arrived at City on the back on bundles of goals for Wolfsburg in January 2011 – it was the demands of life in a new league and environment that foxed him. That and a very modest relationship with his manager at that time, Roberto Mancini.

With Bayern’s Polish striker Lewandowski, it would appear to be the challenges of playing for a really big club that is vexing him after his move from Borussia Dortmund. He has actually scored five goals this season already, the only problem is that four came in one game for Poland last week.

Prior to this game, every one of the talkers at a Bayern press conference – coach Pep Guardiola and players Philipp Lahm and Jerome Boateng – was asked about Lewandowski’s poor form by journalists. The replies were all positive, of course, but only goals really matter when it comes to hushing chatter about centre forwards in press rooms and bars and cafes.

Lewandowski has one for Bayern in the Bundesliga so far but it came away at Schalke. He hasn’t scored at the Allianz Arena yet and, until he does, the chatter will go on.

On Wednesday he certainly had his chances an opening half that Bayern dominated. Had he been wearing the yellow of Dortmund rather than the famous red of Bayern then he perhaps would have scored twice early in the game.

The first opening looked made for him as he moved in to space on to a pass on the edge the penalty area but as Bayern supporters shuffled towards the edge of their seats in anticipation a first touch so heavy as to be almost violent took the ball away from him.

Soon after he did manage to guide the ball around Joe Hart but, from a tight angle, the ball was subsequently directed rather meekly in to the side netting. That is what low confidence does. It turns things that normally come naturally in to challenges that, all of a sudden, can’t be met.

Certainly this was a different Bayern team last night than the one that we are used to. Take Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben out of this side and the whole pattern – the whole rhythm – of the play changes.

With Bayern’s two scampering wide men flying down either side and – when the mood takes them – cutting inside, it must be a dream to be a number nine.

However, the play was a little narrower and one can only imagine that when Ribery and Robben do return from injury Lewandowski’s life will become rather easier.

Here against City Bayern’s chances came in a flurry early on and Hart had to be somewhere near his best to keep his team in the game.

As City gradually improved, so Dzeko was able to exert himself on the contest, though.

Such is his standing at City now that it was not such a surprise to see the 28-year-old handed a starting berth ahead of Sergio Aguero.

With Alvaro Negredo allowed to go back to Spain at his own request last month, City coach Manuel Pellegrini will rotate his three remaining strikers all season long. Dzeko, at last, looks capable of more than holding his own.

On Wednesday his running was intelligent and his hold-up play astute. One run on to a David Silva pass – that led to a shot to the near post – looked almost intuitive.

When players don’t think too much, good things just happen.
