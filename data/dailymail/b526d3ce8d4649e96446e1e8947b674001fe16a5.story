The pop princess took several snaps at the Maracana on Sunday night, celebrating the 1-0 win after extra-time.

The World Cup fanatic posted a picture lifting up her shirt to reveal her bra in the stands.

Earlier on in the day Rihanna posted a picture of herself and football legend Pele 
soon after she landed in Brazil ahead of the final.

Rihanna looked delighted to have met who she describes as 'the great Pele' while the former Santos and New York Cosmos forward also looked in buoyant mood in the series of photos the pop star posted on her official Twitter account.

The Pour It Up singer seems to have been following the World Cup extremely closely as she has been posting her thoughts on matches since the opening group games of the prestigious competition.

Brazil, Colombia and Germany are just some of the teams Rihanna has supported over the past couple of weeks.

She was particularly supportive of James Rodriguez, who emerged as one of the stars of the World Cup, after Colombia were knocked out of the competition by Brazil.
