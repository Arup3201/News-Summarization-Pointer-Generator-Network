Prosecutors today showed jurors the bloody stiletto a woman allegedly used to stab her University of Houston professor boyfriend to death last year.

Ana Trujillo claims she was acting in self defense when she stabbed Alf Stefan Andersson 25 times in the face and neck with the 5-inch-high navy pump, which was found beside his body on June 9.

The shoe, which was stained with a dark substance, was shown in court in the second day of the murder trial in Houston, Texas on Tuesday.

Jurors were also shown a crime scene video of Andersson's apartment that captured his bludgeoned body in a pool of blood, the Houston Chronicle reported.

The 911 call Trujillo made after the early-morning attack was also played in court. As she listened, she wept and held a tissue to her face.

It was difficult to understand Trujillo on the call, and the 911 operator seemed to be unsure if she was reporting an assault or that someone was injured and needed medical help.

When the operator realized someone needed medical attention, she transferred the call to medical services, which directed Trujillo to perform CPR. Trujillo said she was already doing that.

'I need help,' she could be heard saying on the recording between cries and deep breaths. 'I hit him with my shoe. He's on the floor, he's bleeding a lot.'

She adds: 'He started beating me up.'

Trujillo's attorney Jack Carroll is expected to make the same tape part of her claim of self-defense.

On Monday, her lawyers said she stabbed Andersson, 59, because she couldn't handle his physical attacks anymore.

They accused him of being an alcoholic, and described the alleged murder weapon as more of a platform-heeled shoe, not a pointy stiletto, despite what has been reported in the media.

Prosecutor Sarah Mickelson on Monday said the two had
 a fractious relationship and that Trujillo had a history of losing her 
temper with Andersson.

The couple got into an argument after an evening of heavy drinking.

Trujillo and Andersson had
 spent most of the evening at Bodegas, a local taco shop, where they 
drank a couple bottles of wine and took a few tequila shots.

But things turned sour that night 
when another man approached Trujillo at the bar and offered to buy her a
 drink. Andersson got jealous of the stranger's advances which spurned a
 fight back at his apartment around 2 a.m.

The ensuing fight was so loud that neighbors thought it sounded like furniture moving.

When
 Andersson grabbed her, Trujillo told police that she pulled his hair - 
so much so that she had clumps of it in her hands. When that didn't stop
 him she started beating him with the shoe.

Accused: Ana Trujillo sits in court before opening arguments in her trial in Houston on Monday. On Tuesday, jurors heard her 911 call after she allegedly stabbed her boyfriend to death with a stiletto

Fallout: Before the murder, the couple had been drinking heavily at this taco restaurant when a man offered to buy Trujillo a drink, which sparked a fight back at the couple's home later that night

Trujillo phoned police just before 4am 
to the victim's high rise building and answered the door covered in 
blood.

'It looked like 
something out of a horror movie,' Assistant Harris County District 
Attorney Sarah Mickelson said. 'There was so much blood, the police 
officer thought Stefan had been shot in the face.'

Scene: She called police to the couple's apartment where they found his bludgeoned body

Mickelson said Andersson had been stabbed and was 'beaten to bloody pulp.'

Upon entering, police found Swedish Anderson in a hallway, with Trujillo's stiletto next to him.

The police report detailed about 10 puncture wounds to the head as well as 15 to 20 wounds on his face and neck.

Trujillo, a mother of two who's out on bail, has pleaded not guilty. She was acting in self-defense, her attorney, Jack Carroll, said.

'Stefan Andersson grabbed her, they started wrestling, he got on top of her and she couldnâ€™t breathe,' Carroll said before the trial started. 'He got her in a hold.'

Carroll has also stated his brave choice to put his client on the stand.

'Iâ€™m going to have limited time to try to get a jury to understand that although Ana has had problems in the past, she is a kind person at heart,' he said to ABC News.

Trujillo admitted in June that she killed Andersson in a lover's spat at their apartment.

While
 Trujillo claims she acted in self-defense, that doesn't change the 
charges, according to Sara Marie Kinney, a spokesman for the Harris 
County District Attorney's office.

'She confessed to doing it. The reason and all of that will play out in court,' Kinney said.
