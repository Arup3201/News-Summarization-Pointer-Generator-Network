Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany believes Frank Lampard's dramatic equaliser against former club Chelsea could prove to be a pivotal moment in the title race. 

Lampard's late volley against the side he represented for 13 distinguished years kept City within five points of the leaders rather than an imposing seven.

'Ever since I have been at this club, seasons and big moments have been decided on small events like this one so I will never underestimate what it could mean to our season. It could be crucial,' Kompany said.

After 13 years at Chelsea, Lampard's celebration was muted out of respect after he scored the equaliser

'Frank brings quality. The goal he scored you would have seen from him for the last 15 years in the Premier League.

'He is clever and still extremely motivated. 

'He brings experience. It is not a word you make up, it is something that helps and it is like his goal: keeping your head cool in a moment when you are under pressure and down to 10 men - how many players would have scored that goal?

'He has proven it himself in only a few minutes, which is good.'

Lampard will not be around when the title race is settled, with a new life at New York City waiting for him in the new year, but Kompany believes both parties are getting a good deal from his short-term loan arrangement.

'I think it goes both ways. He needed what we can offer him and I think we needed what he can bring to us,' said the Belgium skipper.

'If you talk to him I reckon that's how he sees it as well and his goal was just the icing on the cake.

'Ultimately you play so many competitions you need all the guys to be there and he is another who will clearly make our team stronger.' 

The nature of the MLS schedule does offer the tantalising prospect of a future return for Lampard, though at 36 this would appear to be his farewell to English football.

Kompany does not know if the chance will come again but has no doubts Lampard is still up to the task.

'That is not for me to judge, I think he has his personal plans as well, but I can base things on what I see day in, day out on the training ground and he is one of the better players,' the City skipper added.

'That is as simple as it is. The rest is not up to me.'
