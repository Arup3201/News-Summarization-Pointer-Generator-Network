Rory McIlroy has stepped up his preparations for The Open by playing a practice round at Royal Liverpool - the venue for this year's tournament.

The World No 7 is heading to Royal Aberdeen for the Scottish Open later this week, and on his way north he stopped off at this year’s venue for The Open and Tweeted a picture with the message: 'Great day at Royal Liverpool getting some early prep in for The Open Championship!'

In his last event, the Northern Irishman missed the cut at the Irish Open in his only finish outside the top 25 this season.

And his record at The Open - which starts on July 13 - is not the best, with just one top 10 finish, in 2010, in his six previous starts.

Meanwhile,
 McIlroy is believed to be getting close to top Irish model Nadia Forde 
after the pair enjoyed a night out in Dublin together last weekend, the 
Irish Mail on Sunday can reveal.

The
 pair were spotted in the trendy House bar on the city's Leeson Street 
where they were joined by a group of Rory’s friends for a session which 
ended, insiders said, with a bar bill topping £5,500 (€7,000).

Nadia Forde, who featured in FHM magazine's sexiest women list, has refused to comment on the nature of her relationship with the golfer. It comes just a month after he broke off his engagement to Caroline Wozniacki

According to sources Rory and Nadia were seen 'getting close' all night and left the House bar in Dublin city centre (above) alone together just before 3am where Rory had a chauffeur-driven Mercedes waiting outside

According
 to sources Rory and Nadia were seen ‘getting close’ all night and left 
the pub alone together just before 3am where Rory had a chauffeur-driven
 Mercedes waiting outside.

‘There was a big group of them all together in the conservatory area. It wasn’t cordoned off, but they kept to themselves,' said a fellow clubber.

'Rory’s
 group had about 15 lads with them and there were a few other girls as 
well. But McIlroy and Nadia were chatting all night. They were sitting 
together and laughing and joking. They really didn't care who saw them.'

One
 source claimed McIlroy picked up the bar tab for the large group which 
is said to have been an eyewatering €7,000, thanks to several expensive 
bottles of champagne.

Nadia 
was pictured the next day in Mcilroy’s hometown of Bangor where she was 
enjoying the day with model Katie Larmour – who is engaged to McIlroy’s 
closest friend Harry Diamond.

Nadia
 and Katie were photographed on some pedal ducks in Pickie Fun Park in 
Bangor where they waved enthusiastically at the photographer.

Nadia and Rory first met in Dublin last year and the pair are understood to have remained in contact

McIlroy,
 who split with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki last month, is understood
 to have returned to Hollywood in Bangor on Sunday afternoon.

Nadia,
 who featured in FHM magazine’s sexiest women list, has refused to 
comment on the nature of her relationship with the golfer.

A spokesperson for McIlroy also refused to comment when contacted this weekend.

The
 model turned singer has just launched her music career and has entered 
the US Billboard dance club charts at number 49 with her new song Love 
is in the Air.

Nadia and Rory first met in House last year and the pair are understood to have remained in contact.

Before he partied in Dublin, Rory had spent last Saturday afternoon at Curragh Racecourse in Kildare at the Dubai Duty Free Derby. He was spotted taking in the races with his entourage of friends in tow.

VIDEO Caroline Wozniacki's new man?

The golfer had just arrived back into Ireland from Ibiza after he spent the week on a lads’ holiday with a group of seven pals.

He and his tennis-star ex had been dating for over two years and enjoyed a very public and high profile relationship.

They were known to fans and the media by the nickname ‘Wozilroy’.

Their
 every move was charted by the couple on Twitter and their New Year’s 
engagement was broken to the world on the social media site.

But
 there were rumblings that all was not well in the relationship and the 
couple were reported to have split just months before McIlroy popped the
 question.

It is understood that they had a row when Caroline posted an unflattering picture on Twitter of her boyfriend asleep.

In May, McIlroy made the shock announcement that he had ended the relationship and called off the wedding.

The couple had been planning a no-expense spared bash in New York on November 8 and Caroline had even bought her dream dress.

McIlroy
 said that on seeing the invitations he realised that he ‘wasn’t ready 
for all that marriage entails’ and added that ‘the problem is mine’.

‘There is no right way to end a relationship that has been so important to two people,’ he said in a statement.

‘I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we’ve had.’

Nadia has been single since her split from Ireland rugby star Luke Fitzgerald and has been focusing on launching her music career.

By contrast to McIlroy and Caroline, Nadia was never pictured with Luke and shunned all public events in favour of a low-profile relationship.
