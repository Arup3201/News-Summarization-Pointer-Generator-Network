WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange does not have an urgent medical condition despite reports that he is suffering from a chronic lung condition, it was stated tonight.

Ecuador’s ambassador to the UK, Ana Alban, said during a visit to Quito yesterday that the Australian requires constant medical attention.

Mr Assange has been inside Ecuador’s embassy in London since June after seeking refuge as part of his campaign to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces sex allegations.

The ambassador told El Ciudadano, an 
Ecuadorian government newspaper, that she intends to appeal to the Home 
Office for Mr Assange to be granted safe passage to medical services 
following his illness, as he requires constant medical attention.

A spokesman for the Ecuadorian 
government said: 'In reference to reported comments of ambassador Ana 
Alban, Julian Assange does not have an urgent medical condition.

'We continue to seek the assurances 
from the UK and Swedish government to enable him to live a normal life, 
free from the fear of extradition to the United States.'

Mr Assange refused to discuss his 
health or any questions about his stay at the embassy when he gave a 
90-minute press briefing on Tuesday, saying a resolution to his 
situation was 'a matter for diplomacy at this stage'.

He was talking about a block on 
processing donations by credit card companies to WikiLeaks, which he 
revealed had cost the whistle-blowing website over £30 million, with 
staff having to take a 40% pay cut as a result.

Mr Assange described the block as an 
economic 'death penalty' after the European Commission said it was 
unlikely to have violated EU anti-trust rules.

He said the blockade had wiped out 95% of WikiLeaks’ revenues.
