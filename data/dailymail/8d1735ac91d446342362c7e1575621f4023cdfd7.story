A Montana newlywed accused of pushing her husband off a cliff to his death in Glacier National Park pleaded not guilty Friday to murder charges.

Jordan Linn Graham, 22, appeared in U.S. District Court in Missoula to face charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder and making a false statement about the July death of husband Cody Lee Johnson.

The accused murderer made no comments as she entered the courthouse serenaded with questions from a large crowd of reporters eagerly awaiting her arrival. Michael Donahoe, Ms Graham's attorney,  entered not guilty pleas on her behalf.

Her day in court: Jordan Linn Graham, 22, pleaded not guilty Friday to murdering husband Cody Lee Johnson this past July

The Kalispell woman has insisted from the very beginning that her husband's death was an accident. Their tragic story has garnered national media attention almost from the very beginning, with Ms Graham even pleading her case on magazine covers.

Married only eight days when Mr Johnson, 25, disappeared July 7, Ms Graham first told investigators that Johnson's 'buddies from Washington probably came and got him,' according to the indictment.

Investigators have accused the widowed woman of pushing her husband off a cliff down onto a viewing area known as the Loop during a July 7 argument after having second thoughts about the marriage.

Reported missing July 8 when he did not show up at work, Authorities were unable to find Mr Johnson's body until July 11 when Ms Graham told officials she found it in the hard to reach spot after she thought to look there.

Second thoughts: Ms Graham told a friend the morning of the day her husband went missing that she was doubting the viability of the ill-fated marriage

Ms Johnson cryptically told investigators 'it was a place he wanted to see before he died.'

As time wore on, and investigators began piecing together their case against Ms Graham, her story began to change.

Having first told authorities that her dead husband drove off in a dark car the night he disappeared, Ms Graham admitted July 16 they had an argument at the park the night he died.

Ms Graham told investigators she and Mr Johnson
argued on the trail. When he grabbed her 
arm as she turned to walk away, she pushed him with both hands in 
the back, causing him to fall head-first from a steep cliff, according to an 
affidavit.

Doomed: Ms Graham's second thought about her marriage to Mr Johnson saw the union tragically end only eight days after they were married

Earlier that day, Ms Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about getting married and meant to talk to Johnson about it, according to the affidavit. She said if the friend didn't hear from her again that night, 'something happened.'

Two people who knew the couple told local Montana newspaper that they had their doubts about the wedding.

'We
all had our reservations about their relationship,' Levi Blasdel told 
the Daily Inter Lake. 'She seemed so remote from the relationship, so 
withdrawn.'

That emotional distance carried over to her husband's funeral.

'At the funeral, a number of us had spoken, and while I gave my memorial for Cody at the podium, she was messing around on her phone,' said Mr Blasdel.

'It was very hard for all of us to be there crying and mourning the loss of our friend and she was so unresponsive to that, really no emotion, no crying, very sober,' he added.

Not a care in the world: Those who knew her said Ms Graham carried on with her life like nothing happened in the days after her husband's death

Her behavior stood in stark contrast to the crying woman seen before she walked down the aisle at her wedding, Mr Blasdel explained.

Despite Ms Graham's unusual reaction to the death of her husband, no one suspected her in the death. It was not until she kept trying to explain the circumstances surrounding his disappearance that doubt began to creep in.

'I don’t think anyone suspected her directly until all of us heard different stories from her,” Lytaunie Blasdel told the Daily Inter Lake. 'That’s when it got weird.'

Another friend told authorities that Ms Graham confided during a church service that her husband had died after falling off a cliff - this conversation is said in the affidavit to have happened the day before she 'found' his body at the base of the cliff.

Ms Graham had appeared in court last month on a second-degree murder charge and was released after the judge deemed her not to be a flight risk. She is currently in the custody of her parents.

If convicted of first-degree murder, Ms Graham faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. She is due back in court Oct. 15.
