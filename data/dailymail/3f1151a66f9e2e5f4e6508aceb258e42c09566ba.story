Three Australian professional football players got into a scuffle over pop singer Rihanna’s autograph outside a nightclub in West Hollywood resulting in one of them returning Downunder with a broken jaw.

The AFL players had spent two weeks training at high altitude in Arizona and were in Los Angeles to celebrate on Monday night.

Campbell Brown, 30, and Steven May, 21, both who play for the Gold Coast Suns, were at Bootsy Bellows in West Hollywood when they were asked to leave because Rihanna and her entourage were arriving after the pop star's concert.

Broken jaw: Australian pro football players, Campbell Brown, 30, left, and Steven May, 21, right, got into a fight on Monday outside a nightclub in Los Angeles. Brown punched May in the face, breaking his jaw, when the latter tried to get back into the venue, Bootsy Bellows, to get Rihanna's autograph

Cause of fight: Rihanna, who Tweeted this picture of herself on Friday, was at the centre of the controversy when the AFL players fought over a chance to meet her

Intervened: Josh Gibson, 29, of Hawthorn football team, reportedly tried to stop May from trying to get back into the club on Monday night after they had been told to leave

May was allegedly trying to force his way back into the club to get an autograph when Josh Gibson, 29, who plays for Melbourne’s Hawthorn team, stepped in to try and stop him, according to Deadspin.

It is alleged that May verbally abused Gibson, after which Brown stepped in and allegedly punched May, cracking his jaw.

Other reports, however, say the fight was over a restaurant bill.

May faces surgery and a five-week spell from full training to rebuild the jaw that was shattered by Brown’s punch, according to Australia media reports.

The Herald Sun reports the incident will almost certainly end Brown's 205-game AFL career.

Brown allegedly threw two punches at May, one to the chin and another to the jaw, before other teammates dragged them apart.

Brown has been banished from the club until the Gold Coast Suns' investigation has been completed.   

Brown and May were ordered home from LA immediately and arrived back on the Gold Coast on Wednesday, according to the Sun. 

Getting around: Rihanna was spotted in New York, left, during Thanksgiving to celebrate her brother's birthday party. She also appeared at the American Music Awards earlier this week, right. The singer was the reason a fight broke out between two AFL players on Monday because one of them wanted to meet her, and the other tried to stop him.

The rest of their teammates arrived back to Australia on Thursday.

AFL, also known as 'Aussie Rules' and 'footy', is a similar game to NFL and rugby. It has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.

Rihanna, who recently filmed a music video with rapper Eminem for his song, The Monster, was spotted in New York City on Thanksgiving to celebrate her brother, Rorrey's birthday party at the Bowery Hotel.
