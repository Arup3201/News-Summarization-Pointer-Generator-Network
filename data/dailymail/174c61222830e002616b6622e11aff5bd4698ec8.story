She may have model looks but Sierra Blair-Coyle would rather than scale a sheer rock face than pose on the cover of a magazine.

The 20-year-old daredevil from Scottsdale, Arizona, has beaten a debilitating back problem to become the two-time U.S. National Champion climber with a scholarship to study at Arizona State University.

At one point Sierra wasn't sure if she'd be able to walk without pain but now she tackles boulders, caves and climbing walls in her quest to be the most successful climber on the planet.

At just 20 years old Sierra is already a two time National Champion having been training for 12 years 

Her happy-go-lucky attitude disguises the fact that she has had to overcome a serious back injury

Sierra, who has been climbing since the age of eight, has also practised deep water soloing - lone climbs over sea cliffs at high tide - on rock faces 55 feet above the ocean surrounding the Hawaiian island of Maui.

'I love being a young woman in climbing,' said Sierra. 'Hard work has been the biggest help to my climbing career.

'I train hard and dedicate my all to climbing.

'Women in climbing are awesome. We are confident, strong, beautiful, graceful and we can accomplish anything with hard work.

'Everyone is supportive, and the men in the sport are more like big brothers than anything. It's fun to climb with the boys.' 

However, her path to the top has been far from easy, as she battled through a severe back injury as a teenager which threaten to cripple her - and  end her dreams of being  a climber.

Sierra suffered a bulging, torn and herniated disc in her back as a teenager that nearly ended her career 

Despite her crippling back condition, Sierra says she never considered giving up climbing 

In a video for Outsideonline Sierra explained: 'When I was 16 I started having lower back pain.

'I eventually had an MRI and they found I had a bulging, torn and herniated disc in my back.

'The thought of giving up didn't occur to me when my back was hurt because people get injured in all sports. The more athletes you meet the more you realise everyone is walking around broken.

'All that matters is how you move forward.'

'Luckily I am healed now,' said Sierra. 'But my back will still act up from time to time.

Sierra says she wants to expand her horizons beyond the climbing community and into the mainstream

The 20-year-old trains intensely to master her skills and attempt her rock-dangling daring climbs 

She describes women in climbing as 'awesome' and 'strong' and loves being a female icon of the sport 

'It was difficult to overcome such an extreme injury, but it ultimately taught me how to value the times when my body does feel good.

'In addition to being viewed as a rock climber, I also want to be known as so many other things.

'Climbing is incredibly important to me - it is my heart and soul.

Sierra's climbing is not only her career but has afforded her a full scholarship to Arizona State University 

Sierra has embarked on lone climbs on cliffs 55 feet above the sea at high tide in  Maui, Hawaii

'But I want to expand my horizons beyond the climbing community and into the mainstream.

'I want to help climbing become a more mainstream sport and I want to give myself as many opportunities as possible, whether it is through climbing, modelling or speaking.

'That being said, climbing will always be my number one focus.'
