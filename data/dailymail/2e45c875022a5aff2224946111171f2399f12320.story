A morbidly obese 12-year-old Texas girl suffering from a rare medical condition will undergo a gastric bypass surgery Friday aimed at giving her a new lease on life.

Alexis Shapiro, from Cibolo, Texas, made headlines earlier this year when her health insurance company had refused to pay for the $50,000 life-changing operation.

TRICARE eventually relented, agreeing to foot the bill for the doctor-recommended surgery that is expected to help the 4-foot-7, 203-pound teen lose weight and lead a normal life.

Last-minute checkup: Alexis Shapiro, 12, is getting examined by Dr Thomas Inge Thursday, 24 hours ahead of her gastric bypass surgery

Just a kid: Alexis, pictured at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Thursday, has been plagued by severe medical problems over the past two and a half years

Nervous, but excited: Alexis will undergo a weight-loss surgery in order to order to survive

Step by step: Alexis, pictured here with her parents earlier this week, will remain hospitalized for a week after the surgery

Second chance: Alexis' mother said she hopes her daughter finally would be able to ride a bike and go swimming in the summer like other kids her age

Alexis suffers from hypothalmic 
obesity related to an earlier brain surgery, which had caused her to 
pack on more than 140lbs in two years.

The
 three-hour operation will take place at Cincinnati’s Children’s 
Hospital Medical Center, which will be live-tweeting the procedure 
beginning at 7.30am local time Friday.

Alexis' mother, Jenny Shapiro, told NBC News that her daughter is both excited and nervous ahead of the operation.

The 12-year-old's father, Ian Shapiro, described the experience as a roller coaster ride for their family.  

According to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would continue to put on 2lbs a week, despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise.

Standing at only 4 feet 7 inches, Alexis wears women's size 2XL clothing

Rosy future: The hope is for Alexis to lose 40lbs in the first year after the gastric bypass

Preparing for her journey: Alexis is seen looking at the map to chart her route from her home state of Texas to Ohio, where she will undergo surgery Friday

Fan mail: Alexis' parents said that she has no friends, but since her story has gone viral, the girl has been receiving letters from supporters from all over the coutnry

If her condition is left untreated, Alexis would soon tip the scales at whopping 400lbs.

The weight-loss surgery, which diminishes the size of the stomach and shortens the vagus nerve that control appetite, will help the girl feel more sated with less food.

After the operation, Alexis could lose 5lbs a week, which would go a long way toward curing her diabetes and curbing her enormous appetite.

But the procedure performed on such young a patient is not without its risks, chief among them is the fragility of the metabolic system in children suffering from hypothalamic obesity.

However, Dr Thomas Inge, who will lead a team of doctors during the operation, expects everything to go smoothly for Alexis; she is expected to be out of surgery by noon Friday. 

The 12-year-old will remain hospitalized for a week. Once she is back home, Alexis will be put on a liquid diet for a month to allow her smaller stomach to adjust to the change.

Eventually, the girl will be able to eat a full range of healthy foods.

Complications: Alexis Shapiro has faced a host of medical problems stemming from a benign brain tumor she had removed two years ago

Remarkable: The family's cries for help raised more than they ever could have hoped, far exceeding their goal of $50,000

Dr Inge estimates that his young 
patient will be able to lose 20 per cent of her weight - about 40lbs - 
in the first year after the surgery.

Alexis'
 parents, who also have two younger daughters, say they do not consider 
the surgery a magic bullet that will solve all of their daughter's 
health problems at once.

Mrs
 Shapiro says she simply wants her 12-year-old to be able to ride a bike
 like other kids, go swimming with her siblings and walk around without 
drawing stares from strangers.

The
 family said they have been overwhelmed with support from well-wishers 
from around the world, who have donated more than $82,000 toward Alexis'
 medical care, travel costs and living expenses through the Shapiros' 
online fundraising campaign.

Whatever remains of the fund will go towards helping other sick children, Jenny Shapiro said earlier this year.

Alexis' life-threatening condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor.

During the operation, her hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which help govern appetite and weight, were damaged.

She now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions.

After her brain surgery, Alex's parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death.

'She’s always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we’ve had to padlock the cupboard.'

In
 just the past four months, Alexis was hospitalized for a kidney 
infection and developed Type 2 diabetes that requires nightly insulin 
injections.

This is Alexis before she had brain surgery that caused her to develop hypothalamic obesity after doing damage to her hypothalamus

More than half of children with the specific form of tumor Alexis had experience similar post-operative symptoms.

Alexis may be a child, but she wears a women's size 2XL
 and she goes up a size every month. When asked by psychologists about 
how she is coping with her condition, she has told them she 'wants to 
die.'

After TRICARE, a 
military health insurance, rejected the family's initial request for 
coverage, citing a lack of detail in the application about Alexis' 
condition, the young girl's family was afraid the appeal process would 
take longer than she had.

'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'That’s what I’m scared of.'

The
 outpouring of love and funds on the 'Hope for Alexis' GoFundMe page 
gave hope to Alexis, whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her
 shell. She is now home-schooled and has no friends.

'I hope this Friday will be the beginning of the end of all of her 
pain and insecurities,' Jenny Shapiro wrote in a blog post this week. 'I hope she won’t have to endure another day 
feeling like she is starving. I hope she will be able to think about fun
 things, not just when she will get to eat next.'

If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight
