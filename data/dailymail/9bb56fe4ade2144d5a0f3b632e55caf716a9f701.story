Argentina talisman Lionel Messi is set to miss the much anticipated friendly against world champions Germany on Wednesday due to a groin injury.

His club side Barcelona have confirmed the Argentina captain will miss the contest having picked up the injury in their 1-0 away won at Villarreal on Sunday and will also miss a charity match in Rome on Monday.

‘Leo Messi will remain in Barcelona as a precaution due to a strain in his right adductor,’ Barcelona said in a statement on their website. ‘Barça No10 will miss the match for peace in Rome on Monday and will also not be able to participate in the match between Germany and Argentina.’

The friendly in Dusseldorf on Wednesday offers Argentina an immediate chance for revenge for the World Cup final.

It’s the first match for both sides since the dramatic final at Maracana in July, when Mario Gotze scored in extra time to give Germany their fourth World Cup title.

Tottenham's Erik Lamela and Benfica's Nicolas Gaitan have been drafted into the squad. 

Germany meanwhile have recalled 18 of its World Cup-winning players whilst Argentina, under the guidance of new manager Gerardo Martino, kept predecessor Alejandro Sabella's World Cup players.

The World Cup champions will be without Miroslav Klose, former captain Philipp Lahm and Per Mertesacker, who have retired from international duty.

Germany starts their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign against Scotland in Dortmund on Saturday four days after the friendly.
