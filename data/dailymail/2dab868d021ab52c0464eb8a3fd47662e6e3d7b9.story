Shadowed by an RAF Typhoon jet bristling with weaponry, this is the moment terror was brought to Britain’s skies when an airline passenger claimed there was a bomb on the plane.

After the Airbus pilot notified air traffic control of the threat, the fighter – part of the RAF’s Quick Reaction Alert force – was scrambled to tail the flight as it made its approach to Manchester.

The airport was shut down and other incoming flights diverted as the police and military initiated full-scale emergency plans that could lead to the shooting down of an airliner that posed a terrorist threat.

Officially the Ministry of Defence 
refuses to discuss the action open to fighter pilots or who would give 
the orders, saying it is classified information.

Dramatic photos showed the Typhoon jet
 accompanying the Qatar Airways flight – carrying 269 passengers and 13 
crew – as it made its descent.

After it landed safely and taxied to a
 remote part of the runway armed police boarded to arrest a 47-year-old 
man. They were soon able to confirm that the threat was a hoax.

The incident happened shortly before 1pm today as the flight from Doha came in to land.

Sources said cabin crew on the flight 
were passed a scribbled note by a passenger who appeared sober and 
coherent. It read: ‘There is a bomb on board this plane.’

The source said: ‘It quickly became clear we were not dealing with an international terrorist here but a prize idiot.

‘It appears he scribbled the note out of boredom and handed it to cabin crew as they came round collecting rubbish.

‘Luckily the quick response alert worked well, with military, airport and police combining well together.’

Passengers spoke of their alarm when the Typhoon closed in on their flight.

‘The first we knew of anything was 
when the fighter jet appeared alongside the plane,’ said Josh Hartley, 
21, from Sheffield, who was returning from a holiday in Australia.

‘With everything in the news at the moment, I am still really shaken up. I am just glad to be off and away from the plane.’

Fellow passenger William McDade, 60, 
who was flying in from Australia to visit relatives in Glasgow, heard 
the fighter jet go under the plane about 40 minutes from Manchester.

The fighter jet was pictured arching around the Qatar Airways Airbus after contacted authorities on the ground

The pilot alerted those on the ground to what was happening on board and a 'quick reaction' jet was scrambled

‘I saw it out of the window as it 
seemed to circle around us,’ he said. ‘It was hard to tell how close it 
was but you could see it very clearly.

‘At first I thought it must be just an unruly passenger causing trouble. But when you saw the fighter, you realised that it was something a bit more serious than that.’

Witnesses on the ground said the Typhoon, from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, appeared inseparable from the Airbus.

‘It was very close – I thought for a 
moment it was going to collide with it,’ said Eric Astor, 81, from 
Mobberley, which is only three miles from Manchester Airport.

‘As the passenger plane came in to land the Typhoon tailed the plane right on to the ground. It was pretty scary.’

Eileen Edgar, 71, voiced the fears of 
many when she said: ‘I heard reports on the radio and then saw this 
fighter jet. I thought it was chasing the passenger plane. I thought it 
might shoot it down. I was terrified.’

Passenger Matt Cox, 24, who has been teaching English in China, spoke of the moment armed officers boarded the plane.

‘The police came on with their guns 
across their chest and went up to the man,’ he said. ‘He was very 
compliant. I did not hear him say a single word.

‘When we were in the air, there was a 
general nervousness but I would not say that anyone was panicking. 
Obviously when we were on the Tarmac, we felt a lot safer.’

The man, wearing a green T-shirt, was taken away in handcuffs.

Greater Manchester Police, who arrested the man, said their response was 'comprehensive and proportionate'

Chief Superintendent John O’Hare of 
Greater Manchester Police said: ‘A 47-year-old man from the North West 
has been arrested on suspicion of making a bomb hoax and remains in 
police custody for questioning.

‘A full search of the aircraft has now finished and nothing suspicious was found.’

'The police came on with their guns across their chest and went up to the man. He was very compliant. I did not hear him say a single word'

A spokesman for Qatar Airways said: 
‘The crew received a threat about a possible device on board and took 
all the necessary precautions to alert British authorities.’

Manchester Airport said nine incoming flights had to be diverted. All flights in and out were suspended for about 25 minutes.

A number of Typhoons were launched ‘to
 investigate a civilian aircraft whose pilot had requested assistance’, 
said an RAF spokesman.

Only one shadowed the Airbus. ‘The 
aircraft was escorted to Manchester. This incident is now being handled 
by the civilian authorities,’ added the spokesman.
