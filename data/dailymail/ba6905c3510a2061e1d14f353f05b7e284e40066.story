Many English people are now too embarrassed to fly the Cross of St George – because they think the nation's flag has become too ‘chavvy’.

Almost a third would not display the flag because it has become associated with football and lager louts, a social anthropologist Kate Fox has said.

A quarter were put off by its links to far right extremists, she said.

Miss Fox, co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre (SIRC), said the shunning of the flag by middle England had now become a ‘class problem’ rather than a political one.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she said most people in this country are ‘closet patriots’ but fear being judged by their peers if they embrace it.

She said: ‘30 per cent don’t fly the flag because for them, it’s associated with football and the phrase they used is – I don’t like the word, but they said it’s a bit chavvy to fly the flag. So it’s got lower class associations.

‘It’s almost more of a class problem that the flag has now rather than a political problem.’

Fox, author of the bestseller Watching The English, said her research showed 83 per cent of people in England feel some pride in their country, with only three per cent never taking pride in it.

But she added two thirds of us do not know the date of St George’s Day, and three quarters do not celebrate it in any way.

She said her research showed that we are a ‘nation of closet patriots’ but that we valued ‘the importance of not being Earnest’ and felt ‘embarrassed’ about the big open shows of patriotism seen in other countries.

‘There’s this notion that the English lack all patriotic feeling,’ she said. ‘We take a bit of pride in our lack of national pride. It’s bizarre.’

Another factor is that the national flag has in recent years been embraced by far-right extremists, she said.

‘There are about 25 per cent of people for whom the association with the far right and racism puts them off flying the national flag,’ she said.

‘Although actually 60 per cent of people would like us to embrace St George’s Day, and fly the flag, 25 per cent of people do not do it because of those associations.

‘But if you think about it, the flag was only available for appropriation by extremists because the rest of the population already shunned it.

‘That’s how they were able to steal it – to highjack it.’

Fox also spoke about the impact of the internet and social media on our national identity, saying it had helped us become less reserved.

She said: ‘The only thing that’s significantly changed is the advent of social media, where the English lose some of their Englishness. It’s a bit like being drunk.

‘The English online are uninhibited.

‘It’s like you’re down the pub.’

On our use of vocabulary, said that we collectively enjoyed feeling that we had the power of foresight over our lives, which is why many English people enjoyed using the word ‘typical’.

She said: ‘You have to be able to say it in a way that sounds simultaneously peeved but also stoically resigned and shruggy. ‘And at the same time smugly omniscient - almost pleased that your predictions have been fulfilled. Everything may have gone pear shaped but you have not been taken unawares.’

And on tea, the nation’s favourite drink, she said she had underestimated its ‘magical properties’ when she joked about it in the first edition of her book.

She said: ‘Of course, the next thing I saw was that, in the 7/7 bombings in London, concerned shop keepers rushed out to give aid and comfort to the walking wounded.

‘What did they take apart from blankets? Cups of tea.

‘You can imagine those shop keepers looking out and thinking oh god, I’ll put the kettle on.’
