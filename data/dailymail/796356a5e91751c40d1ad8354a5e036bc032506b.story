Cholesterol-busting statins could reverse learning disabilities in children and adults, scientists believe.

More than one in every 2,500 children are born with the genetic disorder Noonan syndrome.

It causes unusual facial features, such as drooping eyelids or a wider than usual distance between the eyes, restricted growth, heart defects and mild learning difficulties.

The condition is currently incurable, although scientists have identified eight specific genetic mutations that cause the syndrome.

Now tests in mice treated with lovastatin found the drug boosted memory and cognitive ability and promises to help children overcome their learning difficulties.

Professor of neurobiology, psychiatry and psychology Alcino Silva at University of California, said: 'Noonan syndrome affects one in 2,000 people, and up to half of these patients struggle with learning disabilities.

'Our approach identified the mechanism causing the disease, as well as a treatment that reversed its effects in adult mice.

'We are excited about these findings, because they suggest that the treatment we developed may help the millions of Noonan patients with intellectual disabilities.'

Neuroscientists found statins reversed the learning deficits caused by a mutation linked to a common genetic cause of learning disabilities, the study published online in Nature Neuroscience found.

While many genes contribute to Noonan syndrome, a single gene causes about half of all cases.

This gene encodes for a protein that regulates another protein called Ras, which controls how brain cells talk to each other, enabling learning to take place.

It was discovered that the Noonan mutation creates hyperactive Ras, which disrupts cellular conversations and undermines the learning process.

Professor Silva said: 'The act of learning creates physical changes in the brain, much like grooves on a record.

'Surplus Ras tips the balance between switching signals on and off in the brain.

'This interrupts the delicate cell communication needed by the brain to record learned information.'

Dr Young-Seok Lee added: 'Hyperactive Ras signaling in the brain is to blame for Noonan's neurological and behavioural symptoms.

'An overabundance of Ras prematurely alters the brain's synapses, leaving no place for the brain to record the changes necessary for learning.'

Statin drugs lower cholesterol by blocking the synthesis of certain fat molecules that Ras requires to function.

The resulting drop in Ras activity allows brain cells to communicate properly, allowing normal learning to take place.

Professor Silva said: 'Noonan syndrome interferes with the changes in brain cells needed for learning, which results in learning deficits.

'Statins act on the root of the problem and reverse these deficits. This enables the process of learning to physically change the brain and create memory.'

When the UCLA team treated adult Noonan mice with lovastatin, they discovered that the drop in Ras activity dramatically improved the animals' memory and ability to remember objects and navigate mazes.

She added: 'We were amazed to see that statin treatment restored the adult animals' cognitive functions to normal.

'Traditionally, science assumes that therapy needs to start in the foetal stage to be effective.

'Our research suggests that the leading gene mutation responsible for Noonan syndrome plays critical roles not only in foetal development, but also in how well the adult brain functions.'
