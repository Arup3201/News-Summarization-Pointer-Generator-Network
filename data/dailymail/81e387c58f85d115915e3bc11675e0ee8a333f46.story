Time for debate: Nick Clegg is calling for a review of drugs laws after his recent visit to Columbia

Nick Clegg is calling for Britain to undertake a major review of drugs laws after seeing first-hand the devastating consequences that rising cocaine demand has wrought upon Columbia.

Despite robust legislation against A-class drugs, the deputy prime minister added that cocaine use has tripled in 20 years, while one in five young people have admitted to taking drugs in the last year.

His calls for reformation come just a week after he visited Columbia, where he met President Juan Manuel Santos, as well as former paramilitaries, guerillas and human rights representatives.

Columbia is just one of a number of Latin American countries that are demanding an alternative to the war on drugs.

They argue military action does little to quell demand for drugs, but instead perpetuates conflict and violence.

Writing in today's Observer, Clegg said: 'Many people in Britain and the rest of 
Europe will be unaware of the impact drug use in western nations has on 
countries on the frontline of the drugs trade.'

He added: 'If Britain were fighting a war where 
2,000 people died every year, where increasing numbers of our young 
people were recruited by the enemy and our opponents were always a step 
ahead, there would be outcry and loud calls for change.'

Instead, Clegg argues, Britain has resisted 'a proper debate' about the need for a change of strategy.

He revealed the Lib Dems are conducting a review of alternative approaches adopted by other countries and said he wished to see the issue brought to the table in 2016, when the UN is due to hold a meeting to discuss potential drug reforms.

Clegg wrote: 'The UK can lead the debate in Europe and
 Europe can lead the debate in the world. But we must be prepared to 
start afresh with a new mindset and be prepared to do things 
differently.'

The deputy prime minister's comments will be seen by some as designed to distance the Lib Dems from the Tories ahead of the next general election - and will dismay those who say reform will encourage drug taking.

However, his pro-reform stance will bolster the argument of campaigners who say alternatives are needed to help not just drug users, but also countries like Columbia which have been heavily affected by the growing drugs trade.

Impact: Clegg also saw the devastation wrought by drugs during his visit to Brazil in 2011

Just this week, Canada revealed one of its new approaches to the drug problem after Vancouver became home to the country's first crackpipe vending machines.

Installed on the city's Downtown Eastside, the machines offer Pyrex crackpipes for only 25 cents and are intended to curb the 
spread of disease among drug users.

Kailin See, the director of the Drug Users Resource Centre in Vancouver argued that harm reduction strategies lead to overall decreases 
in the infectious disease rates and make addicts more likely to get 
treatment by introducing them to health professionals.

'This
 is one piece of a larger puzzle,' See said. 'You have to have 
treatment, you have to have detox, you have to have safe spaces to use 
your drug of choice, and you have to have safe and clean supplies.'

See
 argued that as every new HIV or hepatitis case could cost taxpayers up 
to $250,000 in medical treatment a mere 25 cents for a new pipe was a 
bargain.
