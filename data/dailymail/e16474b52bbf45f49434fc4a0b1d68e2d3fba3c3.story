From clumpy flat shoes that seem to shorten a woman’s leg to voluminous cocoon coats that hide every curve of the body, there is seemingly no end to the trends which women love — but men loathe.

Indeed, styles that seem designed to put men off are so prevalent on the High Street this season that they’ve even been dubbed ‘man-repellers’.

Here, Kim Carillo, who usually favours a more alluring style of dress, tries out some of these man-unfriendly must-haves and, predictably, loves the feeling of putting comfort before style. But what does her husband Charlie have to say?

SURPRISINGLY SEXY — OR AN OLD BOILER?

Boiler suit, £14.99, hm.com

Necklace, £29.99, zara.com

Belt, £69, reiss.com

Shoes, £195, lucychoilondon.com

SHE SAYS: I feel surprisingly sexy in this despite the slightly voluminous, low crotched look. It’s so comfortable and brings back fond memories of a black all-in-one I used to wear for dancing back in the day. I know for a fact my husband will hate this look, but there is something fun and liberating dressing in something I know men won’t like. It makes me feel like I’m in control — almost as if I’m daring Charlie not to want me. Accessorize with a cheeky smile and you’re good to go!

HE SAYS: I would trust this person to check my oil and change a tyre, but I can’t imagine taking her out for a spin. That low-slung crotch and saggy bum aren’t doing it for me. I think I can speak for most men when I say we don’t much like this shapeless, masculine look. She looks like she’s about to jump out of a plane at 30,000 ft!

CHUNKY CHIC— OR JUST A FRUMPY FLOP?

Knit top, £95, and belt, £49, reiss.com

Helene Berman skirt, £85, grayandosbourn.co.uk

Shoes, £69.99, and oversized cardigan, £59.99, zara.com

SHE SAYS: A lovely chunky knit is always in fashion. I could easily imagine curling up on the couch on a winter night in this cardi, but it would also work on an autumnal evening out. It’s cosy, comfy and sensual. A cardi like this is essentially — an invitation to snuggle up! An utterly glorious addition to any winter wardrobe.

HE SAYS: She looks like a flight attendant on an obscure Siberian airline! Not my favourite look. Kim’s right when she says it’s chunky — her hips look twice their usual size and the bulk of the cardigan hides all of her curves. It looks like something my grandmother would wear. However, slip the frumpy cardi off and now you’re talking!

DREAMS MS JEANS - OR DENIM NIGHTMARE?

Jeans, £85, mih-jeans.com

Blouse, £30, debenhams.com

Necklace, £22, accessorize.com

Jewelled heels, £89, dunelondon.com

SHE SAYS: My jean collection consists of skinny and boot-cut. While these boyfriend jeans aren’t as figure hugging as my favourites, I love the way they make me feel more youthful. Ten out of ten for comfort, too. I can imagine pulling them on on a Sunday morning or dressing them up with heels.

HE SAYS: I am not a fan. My wife has a cute bottom and her usual jeans show it off perfectly. Why cover up such a gem? I love the way I can see daylight between her thighs when she wears her skinny jeans, but these are more manly and hide all of her assets. It’s a no from me.

VINTAGE ROMANCE— OR GRANDMA'S CAST-OFFS?

Floral midi-dress, £329, hobbs.co.uk

Belt, £49, reiss.com

Sandals, £49.99, zara.com

SHE SAYS: Slipping into this gorgeous vintage dress took me back to the Seventies, reminding me of a favourite floral dress. It makes me feel romantic and ready for afternoon tea at Downton Abbey. What is it about vintage clothes that women love and men don’t? I also adore the length. It’s reassuring to put my legs away!

HE SAYS: Well, she must be in there somewhere. Does this outfit come with a rocking chair? I’m not a fan of long dresses, especially in those shoes. My wife has a good set of pins so let’s see a bit more of them! Is this supposed to be a hot look this winter? It just looks old- fashioned to me.

COMFY FLATS — OR PASSION KILLERS?

Brogues, £165, russellandbromley.co.uk

Jigsaw top, £98, johnlewis.com

Trousers, £14.99, hm.com

Jacket, £89.99, zara.com

SHE SAYS: These brogues make me feel trendy, youthful and definitely put a spring in my step. The comfort factor is off-the-scale wonderful. I feel ready for whatever the day throws at me and there is something undeniably sexy about wearing such manly shoes. The fact that they’re so masculine and clumpy makes me feel incredibly feminine. I also love the little jacket, which adds a bit of attitude. These would work as well on a date night as they would for shopping with the girls.

HE SAYS: At first glance, I thought she’d stolen my work shoes. I am actually a big fan of flats and can never understand how or why my wife tortures herself in heels, but these brogues are just too masculine, inelegant and stompy. They have no place on a woman’s foot. This outfit would look so much better with some knee-high boots.
