The White House, the State Department and Democrats on Capitol Hill are side-stepping questions about Hillary Clinton as the controversy over her cyber hygiene escalates.

While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department.

Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. 

Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene. Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business

Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack.

According to the Associated Press, it was the White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails.

That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires.

He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. 

Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet.

His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. 

The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. 

A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days.

Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. 

Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I’m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.'

'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any 'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not.

Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.'

Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all.

'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal.

The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason.

'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said.

Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN.

'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 

'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said.

North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan.

'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed.

And the list goes on.

West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.'

'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. 

Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president.

'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth … we have some things we are going to try and figure out.' 

If Clinton can't make the email story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata. Supporters of Clintons are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year's nomination to Barack Obama

Retiring California Sen. Barbara Boxer was one of the few Democratic senators to stand by Clinton. 

'That's a nothing burger. Total,' she told National Journal. 

'There isn't one secretary of State that ever did that because the law didn't change until after she left, so they're making a mountain out of a molehill,' she added.

Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said he'd 'be surprised if a number of secretaries of State hadn't done that for as long as we've had email.'

'That's all I'm going to say,' he added.

New York Rep. Steve Israel blamed Republicans  for the mess and accused them of 'trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal.'

'That's what they do here,' he told CNN.

'Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between. Just add this to the list.'

It is true that Clinton's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business. 

But other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff. Nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure.

They weren't actively considering a bid for president, either. 

Reporters showered White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest with questions on Wednesday about the Clinton email controversy. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps

Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.

'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions,' Axelrod said on MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, according to The Hill.

'Why did she used a separate email? How did she secure that email? Was there another email through which she communicated with people?' he asked.

'By not answering these questions, they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful. So lack of speed kills in this case,' the former White House official said.

The State Department has said that Clinton had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question. And Clinton, first through a spokesman, and then through Twitter has touched on the issue.

She has not explained why she did what she did, though, or responded to any of the other questions Axelrod - and the media - put forward. 

A Democratic strategist who spoke to The Hill warned that if Clinton can't make the story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata.

'We’re probably a month or so away [from the campaign launch] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks, you’re going to see chatter among Democratic operatives saying, "Maybe we need another person in this race." And that is really problematic.'

'When you do stuff like this, man, you just raise a lot of concerns and red flags,' The Hill's source said. 'It’s kinda weird.'
