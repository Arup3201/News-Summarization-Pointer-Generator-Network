One in 20 pupils is now being taught in a grammar school, as England witnesses the quiet return of state-funded selection.

The proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 – and almost double the historic low of 1986.

Now for the first time in 35 years, some 5 per cent of children are being taught selectively.

Michael Gove is under fire for failing to promote new grammars due to Lib Dem opposition

The law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding. But the existing grammars have been expanding and taking on new pupils. 

Over the past 25 years, their pupil numbers have soared by tens of thousands. There are now more than 161,000 pupils in state-funded selective schools.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has come under fire from Tory backbenchers for failing to promote new grammars – largely because of opposition from the Lib Dems.

Graham Brady, chairman of the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said: ‘These figures prove that there is huge parental demand for grammar schools and selective education in the secondary system.

‘This shows parents are voting with their feet whenever they are given the choice.’ 

He added: ‘It is really time for the Government to free up the provision of grammar school places in areas where they don’t already exist to release this pent-up demand.’ 

The figures on the return of the grammar school come from a report compiled by the House of Commons Library. 

It shows that in 1947, there were 1,207 state-funded grammars in England teaching 37.8 per cent of secondary school pupils. By 1974, there were just 675, covering 12 per cent.

A record low was reached in 1986, when just 3 per cent of pupils were taught in state-funded grammars. And by 1989, there were only 150 state-funded selective schools.

Since then a slow revival has taken place, largely thanks to the grant-maintained schools policy implemented by John Major, which freed schools from the control of local authorities.

But Tony Blair’s government banned new state-funded selective schools, and the total number has now levelled out at 164. 

Just seven local authority areas still have a fully selective system: Trafford, Buckinghamshire, Slough, Torbay, Southend, Kent and Medway.

A further 29 have partially selective secondary systems, with grammars and secondary moderns alongside comprehensives.

Despite this, the proportion of pupils taught in grammar schools has risen from 4.6 per cent to 5 per cent – thanks to their gradual expansion.

The Commons report concludes: ‘There has been a very gradual but steady increase in the number and proportion of pupils at existing grammar schools over the past 25 years as their average size has increased.’

Robert McCarthy, chairman of the National Grammar Schools Association, said: ‘Grammar schools have been expanding to offer additional places over the past three decades.

‘This expansion has been the equivalent of 30 new schools with 1,000 pupils apiece. It is indicative of the strength of parental demand for selective education.

‘We now have a situation where in many of the existing 164 state grammars there are ten applications for every place.

‘Hundreds of applicants pass the exam but do not get a place at a school appropriate to their ability because there are not enough places. 

‘The Government should now look at these statistics and lessen the restrictions.’ 

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘We believe good schools, including grammars, should be able to expand to meet the demands of parents.

‘Through the expansion of the academies and free school programmes we are transforming the education system so all children are able to access a good local school.’
