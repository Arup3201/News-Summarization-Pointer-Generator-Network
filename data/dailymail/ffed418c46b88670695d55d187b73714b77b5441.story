These heartwarming images of newborn babies were captured thanks to a photographer's knack of getting them to sleep so she can snap them dreaming.

Karen Wiltshire, 46, soothes her subjects to sleep by making sure the babies have eaten before they arrive before swaying the tiny infants and gently stroking their eyelids.

She also plays the sound of a hairdryer 
through a mobile phone app as she has found that youngsters are used to 
the noise from their mothers drying their hair.
