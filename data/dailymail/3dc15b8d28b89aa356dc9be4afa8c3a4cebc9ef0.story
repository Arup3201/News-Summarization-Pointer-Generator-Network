A homeless man who was saved from attack by an undercover cop earlier this summer received yet another gift this week from a Good Samaritan who paid for his flight home.

John Boggs was panhandling outside a Plantation, Florida Walgreens last June when two teens approached him and started beating him up but were stopped from stealing his belongings when undercover Sheriff's Detective Vice Peterson intervened.

When the story of Boggs rescue was televised, news of his whereabouts spread back to his hometown in Indiana where family and friends started a Facebook group to raise funds and bring him home.

Welcome back: Florida homeless man John Boggs is
 homeless no more after a Good Samaritan paid for his flight home to 
sister Anna Fleenor, who he hadn't seen in 14 years (brother and sister

Good deed: Family and friends in Indiana learned about Boggs (right) whereabouts last June, when news stations in Florida covered a story about his rescue from a mugging.

'We didn't know that he was in the situation he's in now,' Bogg's sister Anna Fleenor, of New Salem, Indiana said.

But it was a Pompano Beach, Florida local who finally stepped in and made Boggs reunion with his sister possible.

South Florida FedEx driver Jonathan Fischer heard the story, and decided to buy Boggs a plane ticket with the money he was saving to buy a new car.

'I have to help him out,' Fischer told WSVN.

While Boggs was initially hesitant to accept the ticket home, he eventually agreed and boarded his first airplane on Tuesday.

At Ft Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Boggs said his goodbyes to Fischer, the man who gave him the gift of a lifetime.

Just before entering security, the two hugged and Fischer gave his best wishes to the formerly homeless man.

'Hope everything works out,' Fischer told Boggs. 'You ever need anything, call me. You got my number.'

That night, Boggs was greeted outside security at Indianapolis airport by his sister, who ran past the security barrier to hug the brother she hadn't seen in 14 years.

'I missed you so much,' Fleenor siad.
