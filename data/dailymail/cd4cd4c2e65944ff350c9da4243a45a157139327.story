Occupy Wall Street activists are returning to the site of their former Manhattan 
encampment to mark the second anniversary of the movement against corporate 
greed and inequality.

Protesters reconvened in lower Manhattan on Tuesday morning for a day of 
marches and rallies. On September 17, 2011, protesters first began camping in 
Zuccotti Park near the New York Stock Exchange.

The movement has splintered since 
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg evicted the protesters from the plaza on 
November 15, 2011 but Occupy organizers played a leading role in disaster relief after Superstorm 
Sandy hit the region last year.

Without leaders or specific demands, Occupy turned into an amorphous protest against everything wrong with the world.

Occupy was perhaps at its most effective in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, when organizers played a leading role in grassroots disaster relief across the city.

They organized donation hubs, delivered food and medications to elderly storm victims and helped people repair their homes, among other volunteer efforts.

On Tuesday morning, about 100 Occupiers returned to the small granite plaza near the New York Stock Exchange that once teemed with thousands of protesters.Â

But this time around, the park was barely half full. Most of the granite benches were empty. The number of police officers and reporters nearly equaled the number of protesters.

Small groups of protesters marched 
around the streets near Zuccotti in the morning, while another march to 
Washington Square Park clogged the sidewalks in the early afternoon. The
protesters were scattered in smaller groups around New York City.

Without a formal leadership structure or specific demands, the movement has turned into an 
amorphous global protest against perceived ills of the world based around social and economic inequality and injustice.

For its second anniversary, the 
movement is focusing on support for a so-called 'Robin Hood tax' on the 
financial sector, a proposed new law which activists claim has the power
to raise hundreds of billions 
of dollars every year to fund new jobs and boost the U.S. economy.

Among
other city-wide events to mark its second anniversary, protestors in 
New York City planned to march from the United Nations building on the 
city's east side to 
Bryant Park near Times Square at 5.00pm on Tuesday.

The Occupy Wall Street movement 
formally began on September 17, 2011, with the establishment of a camp 
by protesters in Zuccotti Park, a private piece of land allocated for 
public use by the city's government between the site of the 
former World Trade Center and Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.

The
loosely-organized movement was kick-started by concern for social and 
economic equality and perceived greed and corruption by corporations and
government.

The movement is credited with coining the slogan 'We Are 
the 99%' that claimed to highlight income inequality across the U.S.

In one incident, more than 700 people
were arrested as they attempted to march across the Brooklyn Bridge in 
New York City while other arrests took place at similar events across 
the country.

Infamously,
campus police at the University of California, Davis, pepper-sprayed 
student protestors who were laying on the ground.

The
movement's ideals caught traction around the world with similar 
protests taking place across Europe, South America, Asia, and Australia 
and New Zealand.
