Islamist militias have seized control of Libya's main airport, setting planes and surrounding buildings ablaze.

The group called Dawn of Libya, consisting mainly of fighters from Misrata, captured the major foothold in Tripoli at the weekend from a rival faction from Zintan in western Libya.

It followed weeks of fierce fighting. The group said it has also taken hold of other locations in the capital controlled by rival militias.

The fight has largely destroyed the 
airport and scarred the capital, prompting diplomats, foreign nationals 
and thousands of Libyans to flee.

Fire destroyed the terminal at the airport on Sunday, but it was unclear who had burned it. Supporters of the rival factions took to social media to accuse each other.

In the campaign to overthrow Gaddafi, fighters from Zintan and Misrata were comrades-in-arms. But they later fell out.

The violence in Libya is rooted in the empowerment of militias. Successive transitional governments since the 2011 ousting of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi depended on them to maintain order in the absence of a strong police force or a unified military.

These forces receive state salaries and wear uniforms, they report in practice to their own commanders and towns.

The attack comes as part of a backlash by Islamist factions after losing their power in parliament following June elections and in the face of a campaign by a renegade military general against extremist Islamic militias in Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city.

But this has been the worst bout of violence in the battle over turf and influence since 2011.

Mysterious airstrikes have struck the positions of Islamist militias, with accusations by the groups that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, who oppose Islamists in the region, were behind them.

The fighting on the ground has mirrored a political stand-off between Islamists and the outgoing parliament they controlled, and anti-Islamist groups who control the newly elected parliament. Each considers the other illegitimate.

Libya now faces the prospect of two competing parliaments. 

In a challenge to a parliament elected on June 25, a Dawn of Libya spokesman called for the old General National Congress, set up after the fall of Gaddafi, to be reinstated.

The Misrata forces have rejected the new House of Representatives, where liberals and lawmakers campaigning for a federalist system have made a strong showing.

The parliament has declared Dawn of Libya as well as militant Islamists like the Ansar al-Sharia as 'terrorist groups'.

Muslim Brotherhood party member Amina al-Mahjoub, a former national congress member, told Reuters the congress would reconvene on Monday morning.

'It is not clear if the meeting will be consultative or we grant legitimacy to the rebels,' he said.

The House of Representatives, which has fled to Tobruk in the east with senior officials to escape the fighting, had asked Haftar to fight the Operation Dawn forces.

Haftar launched a campaign against Islamists in the eastern city of Benghazi in May and threw his weight behind the Zintan fighters.

Islamist militias also controlled an air defence base near the city's international airport, a security official said.
