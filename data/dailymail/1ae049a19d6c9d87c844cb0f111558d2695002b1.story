They could all be quite ordinary people from respectable backgrounds - the devoted mother of four, a long-serving police officer and a young man with a conscience for social change.

But yesterday these three Occupy Wall Street protesters found themselves carted off by police and today had their faces plastered all over television channels and the front pages of newspapers.

Now the question on everyone’s lips is whether the demonstrators have outstayed their welcome in New York as businessmen and politicians today call for them to pack up and go home.

The ex-cop: Retired Philadelphia police captain Ray Lewis had been pushing for New York police officers to join in with the protests, but eventually found himself handcuffed and arrested yesterday

The mother of four: Dramatic photos showed Stacey Hessler, 38, being hauled away by three police officers for blocking a road near the stock exchange during protests yesterday - her dreadlocks flying everywhere

The young man: Brandon Watts, 20, of 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the first person to set up a tent inside
Zuccotti Park, claimed to have lost his virginity there and has 
now been arrested five times at the protests

Brandon Watts, 20, of Philadelphia, was the first person to set up a tent inside Zuccotti Park, claimed to have lost his virginity there and had already been arrested four times before yesterday.

Then he saw his bloody face on the New York Daily News front-page after allegedly taking the hat off a deputy inspector’s head, being chased into the camp and hitting his head on the concrete.

But he pleaded not guilty to charges relating to the alleged cap theft on Friday, with his lawyer claiming he was assaulted by police and has four staples in his scalp because of his injuries.

Watts has been arrested five times since the protest began two months ago and has been living on his own since his early teens, his lawyer said, adding that he suffers from emotional problems.

Former Philadelphia police captain Ray Lewis, who retired in 2004, had been pushing for New York cops to join in with the protests, but eventually found himself handcuffed and arrested yesterday.

A comical photo showed him sat down on the street in full dress uniform before being taken away. But Captain Lewis later said he will be straight back to the protests as soon as he gets out of jail.

Crowds: The arrests of the three protests - among at least 300 in New York and dozens elsewhere on Thursday - came as public sentiment against the demonstrations continues to strengthen

Earlier he had been seen walking 
around holding up a sign in the face of riot cops saying: ‘NYPD don’t be
Wall St mercenaries' and complained New York police were not handling 
things properly.

‘Here they
are worrying about dirty parks when people are starving to death, where
people are freezing, where people are sleeping in subways and they’re 
concerned about a dirty park,' he said.

Meanwhile the fun is over for a 
hippie mother who left her husband and four children to travel 1,000 
miles from her home in DeLand, Florida, and join the Occupy Wall Street 
protests in New York.

Dramatic photos showed Stacey Hessler, 
38, being hauled away by three police officers for blocking a road near 
the stock exchange during protests yesterday - her dreadlocks flying 
everywhere.

‘What did I do? What did I do?’ she shouted as she was taken away in plastic handcuffs by three police officers, reported the New York Post.

She was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct for blocking vehicles and pedestrians, police said. The Long Island native previously claimed she would be at the camp ‘forever’.

'The walls (of trading floors) may be filled with screens beaming the latest news, but there is typically an obliviousness as to what is happening across the street'

Bankers, finance professionals and money
managers across the U.S. say the anger at Wall Street's elite is 
misguided and misdirected - and people should instead blame politicians 
in Washington D.C.

They claim politicians are at fault for encouraging people to buy homes they could not afford and doing nothing to prevent U.S. consumers from piling on more than $10trillion in household debt.

Meanwhile Jason Ader, 43, a former top Wall Street casino analyst turned $200million hedge fund manager, said many of his friends were ‘scratching their heads at the protests’ when they began.

Many of America's well-to-do say they don't feel particularly advantaged. A recent survey found half of the nation's richest one per cent ‘don't see themselves as being part of that elite group’.

'There was the promise to shut down Wall Street. Didn’t happen. There was an effort to disrupt subway service. Didn’t happen. And there were to be acts of “massive” civil disobedience at Foley Square and the Brooklyn Bridge. Didn’t happen, either'

In New York City, the average pay for those in finance is $361,183 - more than five times the average salary of $66,106 for all workers in the city, according to the New York State Department of Labor.

‘The world of investment bankers and especially the trading floor region is notoriously hermetically sealed,’ retired JPMorgan Chase investment banker Kenneth Froewiss said.

‘The walls may be filled with screens beaming the latest news, but there is typically an obliviousness as to what is happening across the street,’ the former New York University professor added.

Various newspapers have been coming out 
against Occupy Wall Street over the past few weeks, tapping into a feeling of growing negativity towards the protesters across 
the U.S.

Mayhem: Various newspapers have been coming out against Occupy Wall Street over the past few weeks, tapping into a developing feeling of growing negativity towards the protesters across the U.S.

'As apocalyptic acts of public protest go, yesterday’s Occupy Wall Street act-out was a bit of a piffle,' a New York Post editorial said. 'There was the promise to shut down Wall Street. Didn’t happen.

'Between the filth, the smell, the incessant noise, and threat to public safety, they have done nothing but cause a nuisance to the people who work and live in Lower Manhattan'

New York Rep. Michael Grimm

‘There was an effort to disrupt subway service. Didn’t happen. And there were to be acts of “massive” civil disobedience at Foley Square and the Brooklyn Bridge. Didn’t happen, either.'

And a New York Daily News editorial said the protesters showed ‘just how pointlessly obnoxious they could be’ and pointed out ‘no-one expects clear thinking from tots throwing tantrums’.

New York Rep. Michael Grimm told them to 'pack up their tents, buy a bar of soap and head home'.

'Between the filth, the smell, the incessant noise, and threat to public safety, they have done nothing but cause a nuisance to the people who work and live in Lower Manhattan,' he said.

'It's too soon to tell whether Occupy Wall Street's drive to appropriate public spaces will entirely obscure its protests of economic injustice, but the dangers of its morphing into an ineffectual Occupy Whatever movement are already evident'Wendy Kaminer, The Atlantic

'If the original Occupy was an iPhone, yesterday was a Palm Pilot, riddled with bugs, outdated technology and inconvenience. If you want to represent the 99 per cent, the last thing you want to do is mess with the commute'Michael Scherer, Time

'We want to like you OWS, we really really do.  But, if you want our support now and in the future, please stop making everybody’s already nightmarish commutes to and from work that much more dreadful, not to mention forcing cities to spend our already stretched-thin tax dollars on police overtime'Mike Gavin, Wall Street Journal

'Many New Yorkers would welcome the ending of the movement. In
the past two weeks, I’ve noticed a definite turn against the OWS 
movement among my fellow New Yorkers. They’ve gone from being a 
fascinating new development to an annoyance to many'
John Carney, CNBC

'They have no clear agenda, demands or goals. So, much easier, then, to play the bullied victim in order to be pitied rather than concentrating on building a coherent, intellectually sound movement with ambitious political goals'Nathalie Rothschild, Huffington Post
