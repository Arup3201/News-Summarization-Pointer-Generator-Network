An eight-year-old sports enthusiast died from a fatal asthma attack hours after receiving his 50-metre swimming badge, it emerged yesterday.

Owen Jeremy, from Dudley, West Midlands, suffered a cardiac arrest after being rushed to hospital.

The youngster's worried teachers at Fairhaven Primary School contacted his parents to say he had begun wheezing badly in class after playing football at lunchtime last Wednesday.

He was taken to Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley and began to show signs of improvement during the afternoon - playing with his dad in the x-ray room and even joking about his holiday to Disneyland.

But at 11pm, Owen’s condition started to deteriorate. He was given adrenaline as doctors battled to save his life, but suffered a cardiac arrest and died shortly after midnight.

His heartbroken mother Rowena, 37, said yesterday that she and Owen's father David, 41, had lost ‘the centre of their world’.

She said: 'We were talking about our holiday literally minutes before he had a heart attack. This was nowhere near expected.

'We really miss him. He never stopped running around and we were out every night doing something. That’s the hardest part of it - our whole world revolved around him.

'He was a very loving little boy, had a wicked sense of humour and was very socially conscious.

'He loved football and swimming and he was a big Aston Villa supporter. He was also learning to play guitar and he was really, really into the environment.

'When he was four he used to shout at 4x4 vehicles that they made the planet sad.

'He loved all the super heroes and wanted to be a rock star scientist like Brian Cox.'

Headteacher Dave Rowe said yesterday: 'We’re obviously all devastated. It’s such an unexpected loss. 

'He was such a lovely little boy, full of energy. He enjoyed playing football with his friends and he had a great sense of humour.'
