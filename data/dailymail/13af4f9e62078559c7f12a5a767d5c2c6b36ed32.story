Convicted: Sarah Catt (front), who aborted her own baby within a week of his due date, was sentenced to eight years in prison by a judge at Leeds Crown Court

A MARRIED woman who aborted her baby in the final week of pregnancy following an affair with a work colleague was jailed for eight years yesterday.

Sarah Catt, 35, successfully concealed the pregnancy from her husband and took drugs she had bought on the internet to end her pregnancy.

She claimed the boy was stillborn and she buried him and cleaned up the bathroom at home without her husband finding out.

However, police inquiries later revealed the baby was aborted just two days before her due date – and the following day she went on a family holiday to France as if nothing had happened.

The alarm was raised because there was a record of Catt’s pregnancy from an abortion clinic’s scan she had after passing the 24-week legal limit for terminations.

She lied to detectives about having a legal abortion at a clinic, but officers have never found the baby’s remains or evidence to show he wasn’t born alive. Catt has refused to say where her son’s remains could be found.

She pleaded guilty earlier this year to administering a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage.

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Cooke said: ‘The child in the womb here was so near to birth that in my judgement all right-thinking people would consider this offence more serious than manslaughter, or any offence on the calendar other than murder.’ He told Catt she had robbed an apparently healthy child, ‘vulnerable and defenceless, of the life which he was about to commence’.

He added: ‘This was a cold, calculated decision that you took for your self-interest alone.’

Leeds Crown Court  heard Catt had an extraordinary history of secret pregnancies and deception.

In 1999, when she was a second year university student, she hid her first pregnancy from her parents. She quit her maths course, gave birth to a daughter in hospital and gave her up for adoption immediately. She then began the relationship with Stephen Catt, who she would marry in 2009 after having two children.

But in 2000, during the early stages 
of their relationship, Catt had an abortion with his agreement at 
‘around the legal limit’ of 24 weeks.

She did later give birth to a girl, 
but only after seeking to have a termination when she was ‘too far 
advanced’. Astonishingly, she also kept a further pregnancy a secret 
from Mr Catt until the birth. Despite marrying Mr Catt, a  41-year-old 
electrical engineer, she was conducting a long-term affair with a 
married colleague at the law firm in York where she worked as an office 
manager.

Prosecutor Simon Waley said police discovered the affair when examining Catt’s computer and took a statement from the lover.

The on-off affair had gone on for seven years without Mr Catt finding out, the court heard.

In October 2009 Catt told her lover 
she was pregnant. He offered to leave his wife to start a family with 
her but she ended the relationship and in January told him there was no 
child and it was none of his business.

The couple resumed their ‘occasional 
sexual relationship’ in June 2010 – soon after she had the home abortion
at almost full term.

During more than nine hours of 
interviews with police Catt insisted she paid £1,700 cash for an 
abortion at the Marie Stopes clinic in Manchester three days before the 
legal cut-off date.

Detectives, however, discovered a 
trail of evidence to show she was concealing a crime. It began in March 
2010 when she went to the Leeds branch of the British Pregnancy Advisory
Service with the intention of having an abortion.

However, it wasn’t carried out because
an ultrasound scan indicated she was 26 weeks pregnant. Catt had a 
second scan at St James’ Hospital in Leeds where superior equipment 
estimated she was 29 weeks pregnant.

Immediately after the scan she did an 
internet search, asking: ‘Where can I get an illegal abortion?’ In April
Catt ordered an abortion drug over the internet from a company in 
Mumbai, India.

The package was delivered on May 10 
and she carried out further  searches about the drug. She took an 
afternoon off work on May 25 and is likely to have taken the abortion 
drug then. She is believed to have given birth while her husband was out
the next day.

Catt told a psychiatrist she ‘acted 
alone’ at her home in Sherburn in Elmet, North Yorkshire. She claimed 
‘the child was a boy, was not breathing on birth and did not move’.

The Judge told Catt she had shown no 
‘remorse’, commenting that, had she not taken the drug, ‘there is no 
reason to believe that you would not have been delivered of a healthy 
boy’.

Mr Catt did not attend court. He is said to be standing by his wife.

The dangers of online abortion pills were highlighted by the Daily Mail last year when it was discovered that British firms were selling the drugs for as little as £15.

A Mail investigation found that Women could have the tablets delivered in less than a week, enabling them to terminate their pregnancies illegally and in secret.

It is against the law for the pills to be administered without the supervision of a doctor or specially-trained nurse.

The investigation found that pills available online were far cheaper than having the treatment privately, which can cost up to £500.

Buyers had only to fill in a quick online form giving their date of birth, address, and details of any allergies or medication they were taking.

It is legal to have an abortion in the UK during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, but the abortion must be performed in a hospital or specialised licensed clinic.

Two doctors must also agree that it would cause less damage to the woman's physical or mental health than continuing with the pregnancy.

It can only be performed after 24 weeks if the woman's life is at risk, or there is a substantial risk the child would suffer serious physical or mental handicap.
