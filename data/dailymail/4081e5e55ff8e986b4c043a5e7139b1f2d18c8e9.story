Former British boxing champion Jamie Moore has been shot twice in the leg in Marbella.

The 35-year-old was in the Spanish city training middleweight Matthew Macklin ahead of his fight in Dublin later this month.

Moore is reported to have been shot at five times in the early hours of Sunday morning and remains under armed guard in hospital after successful surgery.

A source told the Manchester Evening News: 'It would appear he was out and about, not at the gym, when he was shot.'

Moore took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to say: 'Thanks for all the well wishes. Overwhelmed. Gutted and confused about what happened, but thank God I'm OK.'

Moore won the British light middleweight title in 2003 and later defended it against Macklin in a thrilling battle in Manchester.

He was also crowned European champion in 2009 but retired the following year on medical grounds.

Moore missed out on a world title shot and his career ended with successive defeats to Ryan Rhodes and Sergey Khomitsky.

As well as training Macklin and Hull lightweight Tommy Coyle, Salford's Moore works as a pundit for Sky Sports.

Coyle said on Twitter: 'It's not my place to comment on my friend & trainer Jamie Moore's situation.

'Jamie is stable and will be ok that's all I can say right now.'

Moore is due to be in Macklin's corner for his ring return against Jorge Sebastian Heiiland in Dublin on August 30.

Macklin tweeted: 'Just to let everyone know Jamie Moore is still in hospital but he's ok.

'He was shot in his legs but the doctors have said there shouldn't be any serious or permanent damage done.'
