She is set to play Heather Watson in the second round of the French Open today but it seems that Simona Halep has done more than step up her training regime to be at the top of her game.

In her teens Simona, 22, the current Romanian No. 1 who is ranked number 4 in the world, underwent a breast reduction to improve her tennis.

Aged 18 she announced she was having her breasts reduced 
from a 34DD to a 34C because they were slowing her reaction time.

Tennis pro Simona Halep, 22, who is playing Heather Watson in the second round of the French Open today, underwent a breast reduction to improve her game four years ago

Perhaps it has helped. Simona landed a spot in the world's top 50 at the end of 2012, won her first 6 WTA titles, and was named both the WTA's Most Improved Player and ESPN Center Court's 2013 Most Improved Player.

'It has been an important part of her career,' Fissette, a Belgian who used to coach Kim Clijsters, told The Independent. 'I guess it was the right decision. I did not see her then. I have seen some photos, but she took that decision and it was a good one. I understand that.

'Also in the Belgian newspapers it is the same thing. That’s why she was famous. Let’s hope she will win a Grand Slam and then they will start talking about the Grand Slams and not something else.'

But not everyone was in support of Simona's surgery choice. South African beach volleyball player 
Alena Schurkova launched a big-boob-pride campaign in 2010 after hearing the news.

She argued: 'If she does this, it sends out the message that girls with 
big boobs can't play sports, and that is just wrong.

'I
am 32E, and I have never found them to be a problem. I could be double 
what I have and I would still be okay to 
perform.'

Dr Puneet Gupta, Cosmetic Doctor at The 
Private Clinic of Harley Street, the first doctor in the UK ever to 
offer a non-surgical technique for breast reductions said: 'For professional athletes who maintain intense training regimes, these problems will of course be felt far more heavily.

'Training
 for long hours each day will only intensify the discomfort, meaning the
 size of their breasts won’t just get in the way of them exercising, but
 it can also affect their downtime away from sport, because it may take 
longer for them to rest and recover if they are still in pain in the 
back and breast areas.

'Over
 the years the inability to exercise or take part in sport has certainly
 become a more commonly cited reason for patients I see who are 
seriously considering undergoing a reduction.'

Before and after: At the age of 18, Halep had her breasts reduced from a 34DD, left, to a 34C, right, because they were slowing her reaction time

Dr
 Gupta says that medical advancements may also have contributed to the 
growing number of female athletes undergoing breast reductions.

'Now
 there are non surgical breast reduction methods that exist, which can 
allow women to undergo a reduction with very limited downtime.

'For
 females who train regularly or are actively involved in sport, but are 
being prevented from doing so because of the size of their breast, a 
minimally invasive reduction technique could be a feasible solution, 
reducing the amount of time they would need to take away from sport to 
recover.

He does, however, warn of the dangers of breast reduction in young athletes, many who are under the age of 25.

'It’s
 important to note though that a breast reduction won’t be suitable for 
everyone. It is actually a procedure which is most suited to 
post-menopausal women, so a very young athlete, for example, might not 
be suitable for treatment,' he adds.

While there's no suggestion that U.S. gymnast 
Alicia Sacramone has any qualms, many gymnasts are pushed to be as 
breastless for as long as possible to help their career

Last year, it was widely reported that female athletes believed that the 
development of breasts could seriously hinder their careers - and could 
even prevent them from reaching Olympic standard. 

According to ESPN magazine,
 gymnasts push themselves to the 'brink of starvation' to avoid 
developing breasts and a host of professional athletes have spent a lot 
of money to surgically reduce them.

'For
 the modern athlete, the question isn't whether breasts get in the way 
-- it's a question of how to compete around them', the magazine reported.

ESPN writer
 Amanda Hess cites female Ultimate Fight Championship competitor Ronda 
Rousey's fight in February as a perfect example of a female athlete 
being hindered by her breasts.

Legends surrounding women's breasts affecting their sporting prowess have circulated for years.

One such legend suggests that female Amazons cut off the right breast to hurl spears and shoot arrows more efficiently.

Once Rousey flipped her opponent to the floor she 
quickly rushed to adjust her sports bra straps - a move that ended in 
disaster.

'I got kicked straight in the chest right as I was trying to adjust my bra,' Rousey told Hess.

'You don't see big titties in the Olympics, and I think that's for a reason,' she added.

Joan Ryan, author of the 1995 expose 
of gymnastics and figure skating, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, wrote 
that elite gymnasts would undereat and overtrain to delay menstruation.

'You can't afford to have a woman's body and compete at the highest level,' she said.

Dominique Moceanu, who at 14 was the youngest competitor on the 1996 gold medal USA Olympic team
added: 'The sport pushes us to be breastless little girls as long as 
possible. But though breasts were forbidden, privately we longed for 
them.'

It has been found that when in motion the nipples of a C or D-cup breast can accelerate up to 45 mph in one 
second, which is faster than a Ferrari

In 1995, a controversial CBS golf 
analyst called Ben Wright told a newspaper that 'women are handicapped 
by having boobs. It's not easy for them to keep their left arm straight.
 Their boobs get in the way.'

And Wright may have a point. Judging by research, women do seem to be held back - especially by larger breasts.

A third of women taking part in the 2012 London Marathon with cup sizes ranging between 
AA-HH reported breast pain from exercise; eight per cent even said the pain 
was 'distressing, horrible or excruciating'.

A typical A-cup breast weighs 0.43 of a pound and every additional cup size adds another 0.44 of a pound, according to research.

ESPN also reported that when in motion the nipples of a woman who has C or D-cup 
breasts can accelerate up to 45 mph in one second, which is faster than a 
Ferrari.

Paul
 E Banwell, Consultant Plastic, Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgeon at 
The Banwell Clinic said: 'Large, heavy breasts can have significant 
physical and psychological effects on a lady's wellbeing.

'Pain,
 discomfort, and interference with physical activities can affect all 
women's daily lives and especially elite sportswomen. 

'I
 view this very much as a quality of life procedure that leads to 
immense patient satisfaction. For professional sportswomen the benefits 
associated with such an operation could make all the difference in her 
competitive edge.

'Less weight, less pain and more mobility would undoubtedly help those with very large symptomatic  breasts.'
