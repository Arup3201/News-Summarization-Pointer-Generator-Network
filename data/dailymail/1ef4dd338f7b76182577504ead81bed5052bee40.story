A job seeker has become an internet sensation after designing a resume that mimics an Amazon webpage - with himself as the product on sale.

Philippe Dubost, a web product manager based in Paris, has received as many as 100 job offers after creating the site, which warns buyers: 'Only one left in stock - Order soon.'

He details his dimensions (186 centimeters), offers would-be employers to select a language (as he speaks English, Spanish and French fluently), and notes he can be shipped anywhere in the world.

There are also customer reviews, with most awarding him five stars and a few giving him just one star, which he revealed on Twitter is down to 'lots of ex-girlfriends'.

If the details take the fancy of any employers, he invites them to 'Add to Cart' - which brings up a contact form.

And further mimicking an Amazon page, he asks users beneath each section of his work history: 'Was this review useful to you?'

He puts no price on his services; at the top of the page, he has crossed out $999,999, inviting employers to name their own price for his skills.

Mr Dubost, who has been job hunting since last month and spent two days building the site, also includes some more typical resume information under 'Product Details' and 'Product Description'.

Among the information, he details that he received his MBA from Dayton University in Ohio, has more than six years experience, and created his own web company two years ago - APPARTINFO.com, which allows residents to review neighbourhoods and apartments throughout France.

Since setting the page live, Mr Dubost has received a flurry of supportive emails and tweets - as well as job offers.

By Friday, he had received as many as 40 'job-related' emails, and by Sunday, these had rocketed to 100, he told the Independent.

'The word "hurricane" comes to my mind,' he said of the experience on Twitter. 'An unexpected amazing fun hurricane. And connecting with tons of great people.'

He told the Independent that he chose to mimic the Amazon page as he was a 'pathological Amazon addict'.

'I wanted to do something fun,' he said. 'Resumes are not fun. They're not fun to write, not fun to read... I thought it would be fun to build a small web product that would feel a little bit like a game you could interact with, like those baby toys where every button you push makes a different noise.'
