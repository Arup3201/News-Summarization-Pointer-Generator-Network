Martin Samuel's attack on the Champions League seeding system 

The seeding system for the group stages of the Champions League is set to be changed by UEFA.

The top eight seeds in the competition would be the holders, plus the champions of the top-seven ranked UEFA nations.

Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel attacked the current seeding system, highlighting the absurdity of Arsenal, who finished fourth in the Premier League last season, being in Pot 1 while title winners Manchester City are in Pot 2.

Seeds of doubt: Fernando Hierro draws Manchester City's name from Pot 2

Skewed: Arsenal, shown by Iker Casillas, were among the Champions League top seeds

Were the new rules in play this season, here's how Pot 1 would have looked:

1 Spain - Atletico

2 England - Manchester City

3 Germany - Bayern Munich

4 Portugal -Benfica

5 Italy - Juventus

6 Russia - CSKA Moscow

7 France - PSG

8 Holders - Real Madrid

But Sky Sports News has revealed that talks  took place earlier this year and the plans over seeding - which are the same as Samuel outlined in Sportsmail on Friday - were approved by the club competition committee in May.

UEFA president Michel Platini hopes the rules would stop domestic champions in the major European leagues being ranked lower than other clubs from their nations.

It would also prevent situations like in this season's Group A where the champions of Italy (Juventus), Spain (Atletico Madrid), Holland (Ajax) and Sweden (Malmo) are all in together.

The plan needs approval from the UEFA executive committee - whose next meeting is on September 18 - before it can be introduced but it is hoped it would take effect from next season.

The system currently works on the co-efficient system, where clubs' previous Champions League performances and the ranking of their domestic league is taken into account.
