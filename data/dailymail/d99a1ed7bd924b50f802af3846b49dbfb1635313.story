Manchester United might be concentrating on qualifying for the Champions League but captain Wayne Rooney and his team-mates have taken time out to discuss some other hot topics.

The England international is joined in a quick-fire video to discuss goal of the season so far, Marouane Fellaini's famous lid and crucially, who is the worst-dressed player at the club.

Captain Rooney posed the questions for Fellaini and Phil Jones, joking he has scored the best goal of the season so far before all three unanimously chose Angel di Maria's delicate chip at Leicester in September.

The video then cuts to the Argentine who talks us through the goal.

'I think the only option left for me was to chip it. A beautiful goal and I'm very happy,' said a very proud di Maria.

Clearly the United dressing room pride themselves on their dress sense, with Rooney once again tongue in cheek voting for himself. Fellaini was quick to point the finger at fellow Belgian Adnan Januzaj as the worst offender.

Little does he know that team-mates Rojo and di Maria chose Fellaini as their worst dressed team-mate: 'Kind of bad huh? I'm not liking his style at all,' claimed the club record signing. 

Jones finally revealed the burning question in the Manchester United dressing room: 'Everyone wanted to know what is the diameter of Fellaini's hair.'

So the England international grabbed a tape measure and found out the bouncy afro measures 28cm by 28cm before adding: 'It's nice hair though!'

Louis van Gaal's side face a trip to League Two Cambridge in the FA Cup this Friday night.
