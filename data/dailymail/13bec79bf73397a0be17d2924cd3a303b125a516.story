Fashion labels in Pakistan have stopped using female models to advertise their summer clothing range after billboards were targeted by Islamic fundamentalists.

At least two companies have been forced to abandon using glamorous Bollywood actresses on hoardings after dozens were covered with black posters saying 'sell your clothes, not your honour' last year. 

No group claimed responsibility, but it was suspected that hard-line religious groups had encouraged vigilantes.

Pakistani fashion label J. Lawn has chosen to use pictures such as this to advertise its summer collection rather than female models

A vigilante group - thought to be backed by Islamist fundamentalists - put black posters over advertising billboards which featured female models baring flesh

At this time of year clothing brands 
in Pakistan begin advertising their lawn collections - a lighter, 
brightly-coloured linen worn in the warmer months by those who can 
afford it.

But last year billboards featuring female models were targeted by conservative protesters in the city of Karachi.

Censored: A poster featuring Bollywood star Katrina Kaif was covered in a black canvas in Karachi

One of the posters to be censored featured Bollywood star Katrina Kaif advertising a hair removal cream.

This year J. Lawn by Junaid Jamshed, Almirah Lawn and AlKaram Textiles is one of several brands

which is using logos rather than female models baring flesh this year.

'When
we first started, we decided our transactions would keep the spirit of 
Islam alive — we want to follow its basic teachings to formulate our 
business dealings,' Nadir Khan, customer relations manager, told The 
Express Tribune.

'I personally feel no Muslim would disagree with that - we aren’t required to show a semi-dressed woman in our ads.'

One fan of lawn fabric, Fareeha Kaiser, told The Express Tribune: 'I am not a hard-liner but I have a problem with how lawn ads objectify women. It becomes more about the model and less about the fabric.'

Under the Muslim faith, women are required to cover their entire bodies except their face and hands in public.

A 2011 Gallup survey found that almost two thirds of Pakistanis objected to billboards featuring women.
