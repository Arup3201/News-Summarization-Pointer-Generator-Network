NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a surprise appearance as a speaker at the Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) conference in Vancouver, Canada, claiming that certain governments wanted him dead.

Snowden appeared on-stage via a screen alongside Sir Tim Berners-Lee, created with the invention of the World Wide Web, who was putting forward his vision of a Magna Carta for the internet that would enshrine the right to web freedom.

"It is no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead," Snowden told the conference. "I don't want to harm any governments but they cannot ignore due process."

"A Magna Carta is exactly what we 
need. We need to encode our values in the structure of the Internet. By 
engaging the people who rely on it every day we will get a better 
internet and build a better future than we can imagine."

"I
 am living proof that that an individual can go head-to-head with the 
most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win."

His
 appearance follows a similar video link at the SXSW (South X South 
West) technology event in Austin, Texas, last month, and delivering the 
alternative Christmas message on Channel 4 last year.

Leak: The MYSTIC program is just the latest revelation revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden

The
 Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) conference brings together 
speakers from around the world to share their ideas on how to improve 
and better understand the world.

Snowden
 also hinted during his address that there were more documents to be 
revealed about Prism, saying "some of the most important reporting to be
 done is yet to come".

Sir 
Tim, who was speaking as part of the celebrations to mark 25 years of 
the World Wide Web, described Snowden as a ‘hero’ and offered him a 
virtual high-five when he appeared on stage.

The appearance comes on the heels of a claim by Snowden that the National Security Agency (NSA) has been recording all of a foreign country's 
phone calls, then listening to the conversations up to a month later.

The
 program is the latest revelation from a trove of classified documents 
that Snowden leaked to certain news 
organisations last year.

Thorn: The release by Snowden of secret documents on NSA spying practices has become an enormous thorn in the heel of the spy agency

Most of those documents have described 
the U.S. collecting massive amounts of data and text.This program is 
different in that it records phone calls.

The NSA listening program was first reported by the Washington Post, which agreed to not identify the targeted country or other countries 
where the program's use was envisioned by officials at the request of government officials.

This
 NSA program dates to 2009 and is called MYSTIC, according to documents 
obtained by the Post. It is used to intercept conversations in one 
specific country, but documents show the NSA intends to use it in other 
countries, the Post said.

The
 conversations swept up likely include those of Americans who make calls
 to or from the targeted country. Civil libertarians are concerned that 
this program and others like it will target other countries and that the
 NSA will eventually hold the data longer than what was defined its 
original charter and use it for other reasons.

The
 White House would not comment on the specific program described by the 
Post. But National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Hayden said that 
information sought by the U.S. intelligence community is, in many cases,
 hidden in the 'large and complex system' of global communications

Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who was speaking as part of the celebrations to mark 25 years of the World Wide Web, described Edward Snowden (on the TV screen) as a 'hero'

'The United States must consequently 
collect signals intelligence in bulk in certain circumstances in order 
to identify these threats,' Hayden said in a statement. She said the 
presidential directive that authorises this type of collection 'makes 
clear that signals intelligence collected in bulk may only be used to 
meet specific security requirements'.

The
 NSA is authorised to collect in bulk signals intelligence - the type of
 intelligence that comes from radio signals and communications, for 
example, as long as the purpose of the collection is to counter threats 
regarding espionage, terrorism, proliferation, cyber security, safety of
 U.S. troops and transnational crime.

Bulk
 collection means collecting everything, even if some of what's 
collected has nothing to do with national security. Most of the 
conversations collected under the NSA program would be irrelevant, the 
Post said.

The NSA would not confirm the existence of the MYSTIC program. But a spokesman said that the NSA's collection programs are legal and done for national security purposes.

'NSA does not conduct signals intelligence collection in any country, or anywhere in the world, unless it is necessary to advance U.S. national security and foreign policy interests and to protect its citizens and the citizens of its allies and partners from harm,' NSA spokesman Vanee Vines said in an email.

Vines said it jeopardises national security when details about classified intelligence programs are made public.
