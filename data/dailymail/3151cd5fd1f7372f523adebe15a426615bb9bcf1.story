Court action: Mr Price and his wife Catherine told Reading Magistrates' Court the noise of excited children screaming was disturbing them

As a former chief pilot of Concorde, Roger Price knows a thing or two about deafening people.

His supersonic airliner happily hit an ear-splitting 110 decibels on take-off and would often bring conversation to a standstill as it thundered overhead.

But the 67-year-old’s tolerance levels are clearly set a little lower when he’s in his own back yard.

With rich irony, he is trying to close down a local playground because the noise from excited children is too loud.

Their shrieks have been measured from Mr Price’s garden at up to 77 decibels.

The
 former pilot claims the play area – built around 20 yards from his 
detached house in Ascot, Berkshire – is ‘severely disrupting’ his life. 

He and his wife, Dr Catherine 
Bentley-Thomas, 51, are fighting a private prosecution to try to force 
Winkfield Parish Council to shut it.

The
 local council spent £150,000 adding play equipment to the village 
recreation field in May last year, but Mr Price said the park was 
attracting children from outside the area who are too loud.

Yesterday
 at Reading Magistrates’ Court he said: ‘The type of noise we have 
experienced is that of small children screaming and shrieking with 
excitement.’

He told the court the ‘unpredictable 
high frequency shrieks’ and the sound of parents calling their children 
were distracting.

‘My normal life and my ability to enjoy my home and 
surroundings have been severely disrupted,’ he said.

The action is in the name of his wife,
 a GP. She told the court that the park attracts hundreds of children 
and parents in the summer but the sound of just one grandfather pushing a
 child on the swings had been enough to disturb her.

She provided the court with readings 
taken by a sound consultant that showed the average noise in her garden 
over a 45-minute period on one afternoon was 57.1 decibels, with peaks 
of up to 77 decibels from children’s shouts.

Mr Price, who worked as a British 
Airways pilot for 32 years, and his wife have been backed by Sky News 
sports presenter Chris Skudder, whose house also borders the field.

Mr Skudder, who lives with his wife and two children, said the playground had created a ‘living hell’.

The residents were accused by  
barrister for the council Katie Helmore of not wanting ‘children from 
less affluent areas infiltrating their community’.

She pointed to complaints from the 
residents which included that the park was ‘full of really fat women 
from Bracknell’ who could not control their children.

Other
 residents, whose homes back on to the park, told the court they 
supported the playground, which includes water fountains, a sandpit, 
zipwire and swings.

Father 
of two Alan Weyman said it was a good place to socialise with other 
parents and it was ‘nice to hear children enjoying themselves’.

The
 council is being prosecuted for noise nuisance under the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990.

Mr Price and Dr Bentley-Thomas want all the 
playground equipment removed from the recreation field. Mr Price worked 
for BA until 1999, rising to be chief pilot of Concorde.

He now trains 
pilots to fly Boeing 747s.

He denied he is a hypocrite for complaining about the noise of children after flying the supersonic jet.

Outside
 court he said: ‘The airplanes around Heathrow are very quiet  now. We 
don’t hear them where we are.

'If people want to find something to talk 
about they can, but there’s  no correlation. By that argument anyone who
 has ever climbed on an airplane is guilty of making noise.’

The case continues.
