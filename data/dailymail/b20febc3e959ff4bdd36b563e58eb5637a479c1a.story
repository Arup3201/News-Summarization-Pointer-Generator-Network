Morose: Nicki Minaj pictured on Monday at LAX amid criticism of her Only video 

The video for her new song Only was heavily criticised for  use of Nazi imagery and even 'glorifying Hitler' following its release on Saturday. 

But now, Nicki Minaj has apologised via Twitter, claiming she did not 'come up with the concept' for the animated film.

'I didn't come up w/the concept, but I'm very sorry & take full responsibility if it has offended anyone,' she wrote on her Twitter page on Monday. 'I'd never condone Nazism in my art.'

The 31-year-old claimed inspiration for the video was taken from 'a cartoon on Cartoon Network called Metalocalypse & Sin City.'

Nicki also said the video's producer and videographer are Jewish.

'Both the producer, & person in charge of over seeing the lyric video (one of my best friends & videographer: A. Loucas), happen to be Jewish,' she added. 

In fact, as she made her way through LAX on Monday after hosting the MTV Europe Music Awards in Glasgow, Scotland, the singer clarified her comments via TMZ video. 

When asked  by the website if she had anything to say regarding accusations that her video is anti-Semitic, she replied: 'No, this is my new Jewish boyfriend Alex. why the f*** would I do that. We did this together.'

The star then gestured to a man strolling through the airport alongside her.  

The animated video, which also features Chris Brown, Drake and Lil Wayne, shows Minaj as a dictator type figure and appeared to be inspired by the black and white Nazi-propaganda films of German director Leni Riefenstahl.
