Offer: The former Newsnight host said he was approached about standing as the Conservative candidate for the mayor of London in the 2016 race

Former Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman has admitted he was approached about standing as Tory candidate for the mayor of London but said he would not do the job for 'all the eclairs in Paris'.

Paxman, who has described himself as 'a one-nation Tory', was reportedly asked to enter the field to replace Boris Johnson, who is standing down in 2016.

Mr Johnson hopes to return to Parliament next year after being adopted as the Tory candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip and the party is yet to find a potential successor. 

Paxman said the story 'began life as a Boris Johnson joke', adding: 'I was indeed approached about the gig and invited to see David Cameron to discuss the idea.

'I decided a week ago that I wouldn't take it on for all the eclairs in Paris.' 

Paxman, who recently signed up to work with Channel 4 on its election coverage, bowed out of Newsnight this year after a quarter of a century with the flagship current affairs show.

Only one potential Tory candidate has so far come forward to say they want to try for the mayoralty.

Earlier this week the businessman and prominent Tory Ivan Massow said that he wanted to represent the party in the 2016 race.

As well as Sadiq Khan - who is yet to confirm he is a candidate - several other Labour figures are likely to throw their hats into the ring.

David Lammy, the Tottenham MP has put himself forward and, last week, the popular former minister Tessa Jowell, who played a crucial role in the 2012 Olympics, also announced she will also seek the nomination.

Labour MP Diane Abbott is expected to announce her bid for the candidacy tomorrow.

In 2006 David Cameron suggested that if he were to join the Conservative party and put himself forward, Nick Ferrari, the LBC broadcaster, could win the ballot to be the party's candidate for mayor of London.

But Mr Ferrari, who presents the breakfast show, said at the time he 'did not want to leave the listeners' and joked that he 'couldn't take the pay cut'.

Mr Paxman spent 25 years on Newsnight but quit this summer this after 25 years.

The 64, later told a literary festival: 'I have to be frank — I suppose I am a one-nation Tory, yes.'

He said at the time of his reasons for quitting: 'Look,Newsnight is made by 13-year-olds. It's perfectly normal when you're young that you want to change the world. The older you get, the more you realise what a fool's errand much of that is.'  

His career includes a stint covering the troubles in Northern Ireland and working as a presenter on radio, breakfast TV and the Six O'Clock News before finding the show he made his own.

The Leeds-born broadcaster, who studied at Cambridge University, is the author of a string of books including studies of Victorian Britain, politics and fishing, and continues to host quiz show University Challenge.
