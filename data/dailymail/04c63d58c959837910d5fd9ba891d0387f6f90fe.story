Admission: Former US Air Force psychologist Dr James Mitchell 

The man at the centre of the CIA’s brutal interrogation regime has revealed British agents were present at torture sites around the world where detainees were questioned.

The admission by former US Air Force psychologist Dr James Mitchell comes after an explosive report by the Senate Intelligence Committee appeared to go to great lengths not to implicate MI5 or the Secret Intelligence Service in the torture programme.

Mitchell, 62, who went by the alias Grayson Swigert, not only personally carried out countless torture sessions including waterboarding, on detainees, but was also responsible for devising the methods used.

He set up a company, Mitchell Jessen and Associates, with former USAF colleague Bruce Jessen, which was paid £50 million to run the CIA interrogation programme.

Last week, The Mail on Sunday asked him if British agents were present during his torture sessions, or were aware of the methods used. At first he said: ‘You will have to ask the CIA about that. I was moving around a lot.’

He then admitted: ‘I would see their [British] special operations people at the sites I would visit.’

The admission came as other allegations emerged pointing to British knowledge and collusion in the CIA’s torture programme.

An MI6 agent who reported abuse of detainees in Afghanistan by his American colleagues in 2002 to his superiors in London was ordered not to intervene, according to a memo.

The telegram from ‘Head Office Secret Intelligence Service’ to an agent working with the US in Afghanistan in January 2002 said: ‘It appears from your description that they may not be being treated in accordance with the appropriate standards.

‘Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this.’

The telegram emerged last year during a truncated inquiry headed by retired judge Sir Peter Gibson. Sir Peter raised 27 a number serious questions over the UK’s involvement in the abduction and torture of terrorist suspects, and flagged up 40 cases needing ‘particular attention’.

But the Gibson probe was replaced by an inquiry by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, which may not report until 2016.

Former Security Minister Lord West also acknowledged British agents could even have been present during torture. He said there may have been the ‘odd case’ where agents knew about torture and failed to alert their superiors.

He told the BBC: ‘Would we – as we dug around and had some huge inquiry– find that one agent or maybe two agents were once in a room when somebody was waterboarded? Possibly we might.’

Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who also went by the name Hammond Dunbar, developed their murky skills at the USAF’s Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape school, where they taught servicemen how to resist torture.

Their chance to turn the tables came when they became involved in the CIA’s ‘black site’ torture programme in 2002 after Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah was arrested in Pakistan. He was reportedly taken to Thailand, where a prison known as ‘detention site Green’ was set up.

When he pitched to the CIA, Mitchell had proposed 12 key techniques to be used in interrogation: The attention grasp, [of the detainee’s collar] ‘walling’, [forcing the detainee against a wall], facial hold, facial slap, cramped confinement, standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation, waterboarding, use of nappies, use of insects and mock burial.

Last week, Mitchell claimed his treatment of detainees did not constitute torture. ‘Waterboarding is not torture,’ he said. ‘If it was torture, why does the military subject thousands of service personnel to waterboarding as part of training?’
