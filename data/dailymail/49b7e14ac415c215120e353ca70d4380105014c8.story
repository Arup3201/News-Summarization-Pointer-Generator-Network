Traditionalist: Len Goodman has said he wants to see romance, not full-blown sex on the dancefloor

Len Goodman — feminist champion? It might sound unlikely, but bless him, Strictly’s head judge is coming over all strident on the subject of equality.

We’ve been chatting about who could possibly replace Sir Bruce when he finally steps down as main presenter.

Until now Len has always said there was only one man for the job: the ever-graceful Anton du Beke.

Now, though, he’s throwing another name into the hat — Claudia Winkleman. He’s awfully impressed by how well she has done, fronting the Sunday night results show with Tess Daly.

‘The thing about Claudia is she is naturally witty, and very much at home in front of the cameras,’ he says. ‘I’m not saying Tess isn’t, but actually it’s refreshing, and they make a good double act.

I don’t think it would be the worst thing in the world if they gave her the gig permanently, once Bruce decides he doesn’t want to do it any more. I think she’s marvellous.’

Would they though? Isn’t there an unwritten law about a primetime TV show having at least one male presenter?

‘Well, it usually is a man and a woman, isn’t it, but I don’t see why it has to be. It’s only because that’s the way it has always been done. I’m all for equality, me.’

Len, 69, is as straight-talking as they come. In recent weeks he has been accused of being curmudgeonly: the BBC’s resident Grumpy Old Man. 

‘I don’t actually think I am grumpy,’ he harrumphs. ‘If the contestants on Strictly do something wrong, should I keep schtum? Not on your nelly! Sometimes I do think it comes out a bit harsh, a bit clumsy, but that’s the joy of live TV.’

Anyway, I tell him, we like grumpy on Saturday night telly. It beats saccharine. He laughs. ‘Yeah, when you’ve had a load of sugar, it’s nice to have a lemon. Anyway,  you can’t help how your mother put your hat on. You have to be yourself.’

Len is relishing the final. Who’s been the most surprising contestant this year? For him, it’s BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid — whose early routine he described as ‘all bums and bongos’.

‘She’s been the real revelation, hasn’t she?’ he laughs. ‘She sits there on the sofa of a morning, all prim and proper with  Bill Turnbull ... then she explodes on the dancefloor. I think that’s brilliant — what Strictly is all about, letting us see another side of these people.’

Isn’t he worried the show is getting too saucy, though? He had a pop at Casualty’s Patrick Robinson for a sexy routine.

‘It’s the ballroom, not the bedroom. What I want to see is romance — not fullblown sex on the dancefloor. A little spice is good. But we don’t want people sat at home going: “God, how disgusting.”' 

You might think Len, a former ballroom champ, gets irritated by less gifted dancers reaching the semi-finals. But he says the public vote keeps Strictly successful.

‘At the end of the day, it’s the great 
entertainers we remember. Tell me this, who won Strictly the year Ann 
Widdecombe was in? You can’t remember? Well, me neither. (It was Kara 
Tointon).

‘I’ve done 11 series now (and 18 in the States). I struggle to remember even people who won the thing.’

Still, Len loves the show that turned him into a star. He was 60 and running a dance school in Kent when he was asked to join an updated Come Dancing.

He jumped at the chance and has never looked back, and now has a radio show and his own Christmas special.

Len Goodman’s Perfect Christmas, a mix of his favourite festive TV clips, will air on Boxing Day — ‘if anyone is still awake,’ he quips.

‘They are all there — Morecambe and Wise, the Two Ronnies — all the classics. I’m like anyone else. An old traditionalist,’ he says.

Does he tune in to the EastEnders Christmas special, though? ‘I have never watched one episode of EastEnders, or Hollyoaks or Holby City. I don’t do soaps at all — deliberately. I think once you get in, you’re hooked. They are like heroin!’

This is a problem when he fails to recognise soap stars when they pitch up on Strictly, ‘but better that than feel I have to tune in every day, and let them take over my life!’

Is there anything he hates on telly? He says he ‘doesn’t mind’ modern panel shows, but can’t be doing with swearing. ‘It’s the trendy thing, isn’t it, swearing for swearing’s sake — just because they think it is funny. It does get my goat.’

So is he a Christmas person, or a Grumpy Old Man? ‘No, I love Christmas, and I get really annoyed at these bah-humbug types who moan about it.

Right moves? Model Abbey Clancy and Aljaz Skorjanec

‘I love it! Sherry on Christmas morning, cracking open the Champagne, eating as much as you can. I’m quite traditional about it — this year I’ll be picking up my old mum and bringing her over to ours ... that’s what it’s all about.’

His mother Louisa is 96, and his biggest fan. He says, she is particularly happy as this will be the first Christmas Len has spent married to wife Sue, who is 21 years his junior. Although they have been together for years, they only tied the knot last December 30.

‘Everyone thought they were just coming for lunch — then we sprang it on them that we were getting married. But I had to tell my mum before hand, in case she collapsed from the shock.

‘She’s ever so pleased we finally did it. She was always going on to me before to make it nice and proper with Sue.

‘I suppose I wanted to do it before she passed away. I knew I was going to spend the rest of my life with Sue. She’s the only one in the world for me.’

So how is married life treating him? He sounds remarkably settled after a chequered romantic history. His first marriage, to dance partner Cherry Kingston, when in their 20s, was a bit of a disaster.

‘Oh it was lovely-jubbly at first because we were dancing together, but off the dancefloor, we had nothing in common. When we stopped performing, phhttt, that was it. She ran off with a Frenchman.’

Then came a relationship with Lesley, the mother of his son James. That too faltered.

‘I think the trouble was that I was quite a selfish person,’ he admits. ‘I think it’s quite common with men. Not that I understood that at the time.

‘I remember once meeting a medium and he gave me a reading, which I thought was going to be a load of tosh. But he got a lot of stuff right, then told me I must never get married because I was too selfish. Well, he was right. I was, and I am — although these days I’m about as tenth as selfish.

‘Part of me thinks that I just didn’t 
meet Sue at the right time, but maybe if I had met her 20 years ago it 
wouldn’t have worked, as I was a more selfish person. 

‘I go out of my way to put her first now, that’s new for me.

‘I’m quite domesticated,  which I can’t say I was before. With my first wife I tried to polish the dining table once, but mistook oven cleaner for Pledge and took the varnish off. It didn’t go down well. Now, I make an effort. Not really with the cooking — that’s Sue’s thing — but I am a lovely washer-upper, and like ironing. When Sue goes to work (she runs their dance school), I get the ironing board set up and I get on with it.

‘I have a system actually: tea towels first, then handkerchiefs, then shirts and so on.’

Married life clearly suits him — and he nags his son James, 27, to tie the knot, too.

‘I mean, he’s been with his girlfriend for years, but I would like them to get married, as I’m ready to be a grandad.’
