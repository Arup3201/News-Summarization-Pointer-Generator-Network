An Iowa couple are in shock after a four-month-old boy they adopted died, allegedly in the care of his 'neglectful' teen father, just a month after they were forced to give him back to his biological parents.

Rachel and Heidi McFarland of Ankeny cared for little Gabriel from birth until the middle of March, when his mother, Markeya Atkins, 16, took him back.

But on Wednesday the couple learned, while watching the evening news, that the infant they considered their own had tragically died.

Tragic: Rachel and Heidi McFarland, pictured, of Ankeny cared for little Gabriel from birth until the middle of March, and are traumatized by his death

'It's like he's been taken away from you again,' Rachel McFarland told the Des Moines Register.

Police have charged Drew James Weehler-Smith of Des Moines with neglect of a dependent person after he left his son alone in an apartment on Tuesday.

The baby was found unresponsive by his mother, who had been out running errands, at around 8:20p.m., with a bottle by his side and a white substance around his mouth.

Atkins is heartbroken over the death of her son, a picture of whom she's put as her Facebook cover photo.

But the McFarlands, who have been married five years and together 18, are also devastated.

They had supported the mother financially through her pregnancy and had been with her at every doctor's appointment. The couple said they repeatedly asked Atkins if she wanted to go ahead with the adoption and she said 'yes.'

'We brought him home from the hospital,' Rachel McFarland told the Register. 'I cut his umbilical cord.'

She
 said from that moment on she spent every waking moment with the baby 
until his birth mother reneged on the adoption that was agreed last 
September. Heidi even took maternity leave from work.

'It just felt natural. When he was with us it just felt right. Like we were always meant to be moms,' Rachel told WHOTV.com.

But, in Iowa, the birth mother has three months and then one additional 31-day probationary period to change her mind about giving up her baby.

'We had to go through our worst possible day with our attorney,' Rachel said, referring to when Gabriel was taken from them. 'And then we found out on the news today. ...Nobody called or told me.'

According to police, the young mom left the baby with Weehler-Smith in an apartment in the 6500 block of Chaffee Road at about 7:25p.m. while she went to the library and to run errands.

About 25 
minutes later, a friend dropped into the apartment to collect a phone 
charger and saw the father holding the child. She left and called the 
mother asking whether she trusted Weehler-Smith with the infant.

The
 Register reported that the mother asked the friend to return to the 
apartment but when she pulled in she saw the father driving away without
 the baby.

She notified the mom who rushed home, and found Gabriel limp and not breathing in a glider chair.

Loving moms: Gabriel was born deaf in one ear, Rachel told WHOTV.com. The McFarlands, pictured, had fitted him for a hearing aid and had planned to learn sign language so they could communicate with the child in case he lost the hearing in his other ear

Second thoughts: Atkins, 16, pictured left, changed her mind about the adoption of little Gabriel, left and right, on March 13

He as pronounced dead at hospital.

Gabriel was born deaf in one ear, Rachel told the TV station. The McFarlands had fitted him for a hearing aid and had planned to learn sign language so they could communicate with the child in case he lost the hearing in his other ear.

The couple are frustrated that their lives were scrutinized before they were approved to adopt the baby, yet Atkins' home was never checked for safety.

'The thing is we have been scrutinized. Our lifestyle has been scrutinized; the people that are in our lives have been scrutinized,' Rachel told WHOTV.com.

'We had to have letters of reference for this home study to make sure that we were adequate as parents, and they never had to have anything when they took him back.'

While devastated, the McFarlands are determined not to let the failed adoption and Gabriel's death ruin their lives.

'We're just left to put the pieces back together,' Rachel said.

Weehler-Smith could face additional charges pending the results of an autopsy.
