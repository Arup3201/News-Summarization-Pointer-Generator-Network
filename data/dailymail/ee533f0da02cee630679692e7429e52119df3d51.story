These extraordinary pictures show how a huge group of percussionists attempted to break the world record for the largest ensemble of drummers.

The drummers wore traditional Assamese attire yesterday to play a percussion instrument known as the khol, in Titabar, east of Gauhati, India.

A total of 14,833 people participated in the event to create an Indian record - and they were also hoping it was enough to set a Guinness World Record.
