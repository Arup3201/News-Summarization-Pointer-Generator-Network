A slice of World War One history is on the market for £2million.

The cool price tag will buy you Stow Maries Aerodrome, the world's only complete WW1 aerodrome in original form.

Set in 79 acres with 22 buildings, the airfield site near Chelmsford, Essex, was used as a base for the 37th Squadron, Royal Flying Corps.

The airfield was developed in 1914 after the outbreak of the First World War. 

It was one of several airfields established in the South East of England whose role was to provide home defence cover for London.

In the earliest part of its existence 
the accommodation consisted of wooden hutting and tents - the buildings 
now present on the airfield were added later.

One of the station's busiest days was July 7 1917 when aircraft were ordered after a formation of 22 Gotha bombers heading for London.

Stow Maries' pilots engaged the enemy aircraft in a running fight and scored several hits. But on their return, ground crews found a number of bullet holes in the returning aircraft.  

The airfield continued in use after the end of the war and closed in March 1919.

The sale even incorporates a grass 
runway as well as the officers' mess, accommodation huts, ammunition 
store, workshops, blacksmiths and mortuary.

The aerodrome was bought by private 
owners, who have had the buildings restored, and created a museum to 
tell its role during the war.

Much
of the land has been entered into various environmental schemes 
including the Woodland Grant Scheme. In May this year it was granted a 
listed status.

Included: The sale includes 22 buildings such as the former Officers mess, accommodation huts, workshops such as a blacksmiths

Russell Savory, who has devoted the past four years to the restoration of the site, told MailOnline that he hoped a public body would step in to buy the site.

'When my partner and I arrived there was no air field, it was farm fields, the buildings were being used for farm storage.

'We have been working our way tirelessly through the restoration and I think we are on building number nine now.'

The site has a band of about 50 volunteers who have been helping with the project, which has cost well over £2million so far. Costs have been kept low, Mr Savory said, thanks to generous donations of labour and materials from the local community.

However, Mr Savory's partner has decided that he wants to move abroad and can no longer continue with the restoration, leaving Stow Maries in need of an angel who is willing to invest in the site.

'Really the plan is to make it the number one visitor centre in the whole of Essex,' Mr Savory said, adding that he hoped to make it an educational site for both First World War aviation and wildlife conservation.

Most importantly, the site needs a 
£300,000 hangar to house a number of planes that have been promised to 
the museum, to add to a collection that already includes three period aircraft including a Sopwith Camel.

Mr Savory added: 'I've put in four 
years of work and a reasonable sum of cash because it's one of those 
sites that just grabs your imagination.'

According to English Heritage, is now 'the largest known surviving group of Royal Flying Corps buildings on a WWI aerodrome.'
