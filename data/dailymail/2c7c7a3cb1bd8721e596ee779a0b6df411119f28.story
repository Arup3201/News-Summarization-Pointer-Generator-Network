A taxi driver who killed a 17-year-old girl while driving down the wrong side of the road had been given a cab licence by the council despite having been banned from driving nine times before.

David Baillie, 40, was overtaking a car in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, when he ran down Sarah Burke, 17, who was crossing the road on her way home from college.

She was hurled 65ft by the impact, suffered multiple fractures and brain trauma. After five days in hospital she died of her injuries.

After a trial Baillie was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for seven years.

But now Miss Burke's family has taken the council to task for approving his licence despite the   despite his string of previous convictions.

It emerged he had been given a Hackney licence by the council just days before the smash.

His previous convictions totalled eight for driving while disqualified, two for dangerous driving, 10 for theft of a motor vehicle and five for driving with no insurance.

Miss Burke's parents, Stephen and Theresa, said: 'We are very saddened by the response of Sunderland Council to the issue of taxi licences.

'We think they know they have done wrong but won’t admit it. It would be nice to hear them say that they have made a mistake.

'Baillie has been given chance after chance. Why was this person even on the road? We truly believe that he will do the same again when he gets out.'

Miss Burke was mown down by Baillie’s Volvo S60, which swerved and accelerated to get past a Vauxhall Corsa on September 17 last year. He was off duty at the time.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the teenager was ‘like a rabbit in the headlights’ when Baillie smashed into her, throwing her into the air before she landed on her head 20m away. 

Baillie admitted causing death by careless driving, but denied causing Sarah’s death by dangerous driving, but was found guilty by a jury. 

Sunderland City Council defended itself by saying its regulatory committee was following guidance from central Government.

The Department for Transport only suggests taxi licence applicants be ‘free of driving or motoring convictions for a period of between one to three years’, which would not have covered Baillie's previous convictions, which were all more than a decade old.

Mr and Mrs Burke have asked to meet the council's leader, Paul Watson, and are campaigning alongside victim's charity Road Peace to secure tougher sentences.

Mr Burke, who wants to see sentences starting from 10 years and driving bans starting on release from jail, said: 'You read about things like this all the time, but until it happens to you, you can’t imagine it.

'It’s just horrific. It’s like we are in this bubble. It’s the likes of us that suffer, law-abiding citizens. We’ve been driving for 50 years between us, not having got a single point and something like this happens, it does seem unfair.

'It won’t bring Sarah back, but there has to be a deterrent. Driving bans start when a prison sentence starts, it’s just not common sense.

'There were many thousands of lives lost like this before this happened to us, and until something is done, there will sadly be many more thousands.

'But it all seems to be falling on deaf ears.'

Speaking earlier this month, Sunderland City Council leader Paul Watson defended the decision to issue Baillie’s licence.

He said: 'That decision was made in line with Department for Transport advice and guidance that is provided by that department and the government.

'I don’t think we have the authority to look at the issue anyway.'

But A DfT spokesman said: 'It is for individual licensing authorities to reach their own decisions both on overall policies and on individual licensing matters.'

'This guidance is intended to assist licensing authorities but it is only guidance and decisions on any matters remain a matter for the authority concerned.'
