When Jordan Axani booked an around-the-world plane ticket for him and his girlfriend in March he began gearing up for the romantic getaway of a lifetime.

But his relationship with Elizabeth Gallagher came to a end, leaving the 27-year-old with a pricey travel itinerary and no one to share it with.

Knowing that it is almost impossible to change the name on an airplane ticket, the Canadian felt he only had one choice - find someone with the same name as his ex. 

Proposed trip: Jordan Axani booked the around the world ticket with his girlfriend Elizabeth Gallagher in March, but the pair have since broken up 

Change of plan: Knowing that it is almost impossible to change the name on an airplane ticket, the Canadian felt he only had one choice - find someone with the same name as his ex

Therefore he started an online campaign to find someone with a Canadian passport, called Elizabeth Gallagher.

Taking off on December 21 from New York's JFK International Airport, the 18-day whirlwind trip takes in Italy, France, Thailand and India, before heading back to Toronto. 

To begin his search, he posted a plea on Reddit. It said: 'I need your help. You see, in March I booked a fairly wicked trip around the world for this Christmas for my ex and I. 

'While our relationship has come to a close, I am still planning on going on the trip and she is not (naturally). 

'And because I hate the idea of a ticket around the world going to waste, I am looking for a Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher who could use the ticket.

Expectations: Mr Axani has laid down a few ground rules for his trip, suggesting he is not looking for companionship or romance and wants his fellow traveler to simply enjoy the trip 

Plea: Considering his options, Mr Axani began his search by posting this message on Reddit 

'Anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible. 

'Moreover, the flights were purchased during a massive blow-up on Priceline and were frankly so cheap and on so many different airlines that they're not worth the headache or money to cancel.'

The journey begins on December 21 in New York city with a flight to Milan. From there, Mr Axani heads to Prague, Paris, Bangkok and New Delhi, before heading back to Toronto on January 8. 

Before potential candidates start applying to accompany him, he has laid some ground rules, but has offered to buy the first glass of wine before jetting off. 

Traveler: Mr Axani, laying the ground rules for his potential companion, said: 'Embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing, though, so if you want to travel together (and are not an axe murder) I’m likely game

He wrote: 'I am not looking for anything in return. I am not looking for companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front the Christmas Market in Prague. 

'If you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks, great. Really the only thing I ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness.

'We can travel together and see some cool stuff - or not. I'm easy and have no problem with someone taking the tickets and doing their own thing (see ya on the plane!). 

'Embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing, though, so if you want to travel together (and are not an axe murder) I’m likely game.

'This is for the flights only. In the wake of the breakup I have deferred all further planning for the trip. No hotels, trains or anything have been booked. You're on your own, bucko. Having said that, I will buy the first round of vino at JFK upon departure.' 

Globetrotter: He has been on numerous international trips and aims to take two international trips every year
