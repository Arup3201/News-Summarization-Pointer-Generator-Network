A mother who took her daughter to hospital after she collapsed at home says she was sent away with Calpol three times, despite her protestations.

Freya Davies-Redding, five, has a rare brain disorder, similar to cerebral palsy, which means she has epileptic fits and a weak left side.

Freya collapsed into a TV stand at the family home in Barnstaple, Devon on Saturday, September 29.

An EEG scan revealed Freya Davies-Redding was fitting every ten seconds

But when mother Claire went to North 
Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple she claims a registrar suggested 
she be taken home and given Calpol.

She then says they went back to the hospital the next two days running but was sent home and told to take Calpol each time.

Freya eventually got the treatment she needs but her mother says the delay means she now fits even more than before.

Claire said: 'The registrar didn’t even ask us what kind of brain condition Freya had. I don’t know what he was thinking. Perhaps he thought it was a bit too much paperwork.

'Her fits have got worse and she needs a new drug. I think it would have been prevented if the registrar had taken notice from the beginning.'

Eventually the hospital gave Freya an EEG (electroencephalogram) which checked her brain and found she was fitting every 10 seconds.

Jim Bray, spokesman for Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust, said Freya had undergone a thorough examination and tests.

Claire took her daughter Freya to North Devon District Hospital, Barnstaple, Devon, but she said treatment was delayed

He said: 'After the EEG test, our clinician acted immediately to manage the patient’s care in collaboration with neurology specialists at Bristol Children’s Hospital.

'For rare conditions needing specialist treatment, this is a normal pathway of care for Northern Devon residents.

'During this time we regularly updated the patient’s mother, who gave us the impression she was happy with her daughter’s management.'

Alison Diamond, the Trust’s medical director, said: 'This was a very complex and difficult diagnosis.

'Once the EEG identified a problem, the team worked closely with Bristol Children’s Hospital to manage the patient.

'If it had been an emergency, the patient would have been transferred to Bristol earlier.

'We understand the parents’ frustration and are disappointed our levels of care did not reach their expectations.

'We strive to provide all our patients with the utmost care and compassion, regardless of their needs. We always welcome comments on where we need to improve.'
