Lionel Messi has pledged to stay at Barcelona amid talk of a move to the Premier League. 

The Argentine, who has been at the Nou Camp since he was a boy, has become disenchanted with the way in which new boss Luis Enrique manages the Catalans. 

And that looked as if it would come to a head sooner rather than later, but Spanish paper Sport report that Messi will remain at the club.

It is believed the Argentina international has fallen out with Barcelona manager Luis Enrique

Former Brighton and Watford head coach Oscar Garcia is surprisingly being sounded out should Enrique be given his marching orders. 

That looks all the more likely now Messi has held talks with president Josep Bartomeu, with the pair discussing his fears. 

The 27-year-old is said to want a restructuring of how the first team is organised. 

'Messi will do what makes him happiest,' said Cesc Fabregas, speaking to Spanish radio programme Al Primer Toque on Onda Cero.

'Personally, as his friend, colleague and footballer, if you gave me the chance to play with him again, I would welcome it.

'I don't know Luis Enrique. I do know Leo and I doubt very much that what is being said is happening, because he's a very relaxed guy and I've never seen any of that in the three years we spent together.'
