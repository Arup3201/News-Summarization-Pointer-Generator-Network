A Democratic Senator skipped his own fundraiser today to avoid being seen with President Barack Obama.

Colorado Sen. Mark Udall was slated to appear at a luncheon benefiting his campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Denver this afternoon with the president.

The fundraiser had been on the books for at least a month, and Udall, who is up for reelection this year, had touted the joint appearance to supporters.

Udall's campaign suddenly announced this morning that the Senator had changed his mind and would stay in Washington today instead.

The only high-ranking Democrat who would even be seen in pubic with the president during his trip to Colorado was Governor John Hickenlooper - and they ran into each other at the bar.

Democratic politicians steered clear of President Barack Obama when he came to Colorado this week

None of the state's top Democrats joined the president today at Cheesman Park in Denver, where he gave a speech on the economy and spoke with locals

Udall, Hickenlooper and former Colorado state house speaker and current congressional candidate Andrew Romanoff had already said they would not attend a speech the president was giving on the economy this morning in Denver's Cheesman Park.

Romanoff has been on bad terms with the White House since it tried to convince him to stay out of the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate in 2010 to make things easier for sitting Democratic Senator Michael Bennett.

A spokeman for Hickenlooper told the Denver Post on Monday that the Governor was simply booked by the time Obama scheduled his remarks.

'The governor has been confirmed since late May to attend a veterans' event on Wednesday morning in Colorado Springs,' said the spokesman, Eric Brown, adding that the governor's office had only just learned of Obama's speech.

'This
 has nothing to do with wanting to be with him or not. This is just 
logistics,' Udall campaign spokesman Chris Harris told the Denver Post when he asked about his boss' plans.

'If the president is in town, and the president wants to be helpful, why
 would anyone want to pass that up?' Udall campaign consultant Mike Stratton said.

'I don't think one visit 
by the president is going to change anything in terms of the dynamics of
 the campaign.'

Ahead of the Democratic Senator's fundraiser featuring Obama today, Udall sent an email to supporters telling them how much he was looking forward to introducing them to the president.

'I'm grateful for President Obama's support in this U.S. Senate race, and I'm looking forward to bringing him out to Colorado for a campaign event,' Udall said, according to the Denver Post.

'But I'm especially excited to introduce him to you, friend,' he continued.

Udall's campaign announced this morning, however, that the Senator would remain in D.C. today to vote for Obama's nominee to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Julian Castro.

'Mark is grateful for the president's support, and had hoped to welcome 
him to Colorado in person, but his responsibilities to serve Colorado in
 the Senate come first,' Harris said.

But Castro was expected to be confirmed by the Senate with no extreme difficulty and ended up being approved for the post by nearly three quarters of the Senate.

Sen. Mark Udall skipped his own fundraiser today and remained on Capitol Hill in Washington to avoid being seen with President Obama

Republicans 
said it didn't come as a shock to them that none of the state's top Democrats 
wanted to rub elbows with Obama - least of all Udall, whose race against
 Republican Rep. Cory Gardner is ranked as a toss-up on polling site 
Real Clear Politics.

'Actions speak louder than words,' a National Republican Senatorial Committee statement said today. 'It’s clear 
that the President is beyond toxic, and Mark Udall’s campaign is running
 scared.'

'It’s
 hardly surprising that Gov. Hickenlooper and Sen. Udall are doing 
everything they can to run away from the worst president since World War
 II,' Colorado Republican 
Committee Chairman Ryan Call said in a statement on Monday, referring to
 a recent Quinnipiaic poll in which Obama was rated the least liked 
president since 1945.

Obama has a 38 percent approval 
rating in Colorado, according to Quinnipiac University, and Gallup says he has a marginally higher 43 percent
 approval rating nationally.

'I
 don't think there are accidents when it comes to the president's 
schedule, and I don't think there are accidents when it comes to 
senators and members of Congress and their schedules,' Nathan Gonzales, 
an analyst for the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report, told the 
Denver Post earlier this week.

The only current politician who was willing to hang out with Obama in pubic was Governor John Hickenlooper, right, who ran into the president at a bar

Hickenlooper used to own the bar, Wynkoop Brewing Company, and was hanging out there when Obama dropped by

The Colorado Governor then challenged the president to a game of pool. 'I took his lunch money,' Obama told a group of donors today

Hickenlooper ended up hanging out with Obama at a bar last night, but the meet-up doesn't appear to have been preplanned.

Obama
 said he was having a drink nearby with some locals and decided to 
drop by Wynkoop Brewing Company, an establishment Hickenlooper used to 
own.

The
 Colorado Governor just happened to be there at the time, and invited 
the president to play a game of pool. Or at least that's how Obama made the encounter sound during his remarks
 at this afternoon's fundraiser.

'You can ask him how that went,' Obama said of the pool game. 'I took his lunch money.'

Obama
 also mentioned Udall in his remarks, saying he 'is a serious person who
 is trying to do the right thing and who has the values that we share.'

'He is not an ideologue. He doesn’t agree with me on everything,' Obama admitted.

'But
 he believes in the core idea that I think should be what Democrats are 
all about, this idea that if you work hard you should be able to make 
it,' he said. 'And that’s worth supporting.'

Udall's
 absence from the fundraiser was made more noticeable by the fact that 
he is the only candidate whom Obama has campaigned for directly this 
year.

The
 proceeds for other events Obama has appeared at this year went directly
 to the Democratic Party. Half of the donations from today's 
event - which cost as much as $15,000 a couple to attend - will go directly to 
Udall.

Udall is not alone, however, in his attempts to avoid the unpopular president this election year.

North Carolina Senator Kay Hagen, who is also caught up in a 
touch reelection battle, stayed in Washington when Obama came to her 
state, too.

Alaska Sen. Mark Begich said in January that if the president ever came to Alaska he wouldn't campaign with him.

'I don’t need him campaigning for me — I need him to change some of his policies,' the endangered Democrat said.

'If he wants to come up there and learn about Alaska, bring it on — 
I’ll drag him around, I’ll show him whatever he wants to see,' he said, but campaigning is a no-go.

'I’m not really interested in campaigning.'
