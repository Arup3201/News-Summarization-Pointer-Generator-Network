A drunken thug repeatedly kicked and jumped on a man's head as he lay cowering in the road. 

Liam Sewell cried in the dock as he watched CCTV footage of him, drunk and bare-chested, repeatedly stamping on the head of Kenneth Burton in a street in Hull.

After kicking and jumping on his head, the 21-year-old even ran away from his victim as he lay in the street only to return and stamp on his head again.

The judge described the attack as 'chilling' and said it was astonishing that Mr Burton, who was left lying motionless in the road, did not suffer damage to his brain or die.

Liam Sewell was caught on CCTV repeatedly kicking Kenneth Burton and stamping on his head in a street in Hull. The 21-year-old, who sobbed as he saw the footage at Hull Crown Court, has been jailed for 10 months

Sewell, who admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm, was jailed for 10 months by a judge who branded his actions 'gross' and 'extreme.' 

The incident took place at about 12.30am on November 1 when Sewell was captured on CCTV bare-chested and in a gang.

It is not clear what happened before the attack but it is alleged Sewell had earlier had his nose bitten.

CCTV footage shown to Hull Crown Court captured Sewell first walking down Anlaby Road, with friends, who are gesturing towards Walliker Street, which he then runs down.

Footage showed him walking alongside his victim, before squaring up to him and pushing him hard in the chest.

As a friend tried to intervene, Sewell shoved Mr Burton to the ground and kicked him hard in the head four times.

A judge said it was astonishing that Mr Burton had not suffered a brain injury or died after the stamping

The friend managed to 'rugby tackle' Sewell off his victim, who scrambles back onto his feet, only for his attacker to return moments later. As his victim lay cowering in the street, Sewell, ran over and stamped down hard on his head twice.

He then ran away again, only to return a second time to stamp his head into the concrete two more times.

Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said: 'It was chilling. 'A young man was kicked, repeatedly, by you and during the course of that attack, you additionally stamped upon him.

'There can be no doubt you intended much more serious injuries than were caused to him.

Sewell, 21, admitted assaulting occasioning actual bodily harm and was locked up for 10 months 

'It is a miracle he was not more seriously injured by your action.

'The victim of such an assault could so easily have died.'

Mr Burton was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, where he was treated for concussion.

A CT scan revealed he had escaped brain injury.

Prosecutor Philip Evans said: 'The Crown places this at the top of the tier for assault and does so because it is a repeated assault, albeit the injuries are slight.

'A shoed foot is used as a weapon and the defendant intended greater injury by his actions than were actually caused.'

Paul Norton, defending, described the attack as an 'alcohol fuelled loss of control' and said Sewell, who has three convictions for violent offences, including threatening someone with a blade, had witnessed violence as a child.

Mr Norton said: 'There was a degree of mutual aggression between him and the other person.

'Mr Sewell believed his nose was bitten.

'The CCTV also showed after he was rugby tackled by his peacemaker friend, another person took the opportunity to kick Sewell in the upper region of his body.

'Whilst the defendant's reaction is quite grossly and gratuitously extreme, this was not an assault on an entirely peaceful and innocent member of the public.'

Sentencing Sewell, Judge Richardson said: 'It is truly miraculous he sustained no real injury apart from being unconscious for a short while.

'You kicked out and stamped, you intended greater harm.

'I note there was an incident with you before all this erupted, you were injured, but this was a gross, over-extreme response, whatever happened beforehand.'
