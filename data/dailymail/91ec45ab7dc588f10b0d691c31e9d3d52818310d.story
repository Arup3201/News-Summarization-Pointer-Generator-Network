'After a much needed night of rest, Grandma has come to peace with her battle of lung cancer,' he wrote. 'Although Grandma Betty is no longer physically with us, she will forever be in the hearts of the millions of people she touches every single day.'

'Grandma Betty did not lose her battle to cancer, because her legacy she has left behind will inspire millions of people to #Smile, #BeHappy, and #StayHappy no matter what. 

'The fight has ended. The battle is won.'

The final post to Betty's Instagram had nearly 60,000 likes and comments only nine hours after her death.

Peace and love: The account, set up in Louisville, Kentucky, has attracted thousands of supporters worldwide

'The idea was to start an account for my friends who know Grandma Betty,' the schoolboy told WDRB Kentucky, 'And it turned out to be something everybody started to enjoy.'

He began by posting pictures of Betty and her late husband shortly after being told she had lung cancer.

After the account went viral, Betty says she began feeling like a celebrity every time she gets a new follower.

'We get joy out of listening to her say everyday, "How many more friends do I have today,' granddaughter Hope Belden added.

Even though they have received thousands of messages of support, and a handful of gifts, Grandma Betty said she hopes the page will give followers some wisdom.

'Maybe they'll learn something from me. I've been here 80 years, maybe they'll learn something good from me,' she said.

Betty's Instagram was not just limited to photos, it also included videos.

One of the most popular videos showed her dancing to the hit Pharrell Williams song, 'Happy.'

'I thought that was cute,' she said.

'I can no longer think of that song without thinking of her,' Hope added.

'This is going to be something we're always going to have and something we're always going to remember and definitely cherish forever.

'I'll always have that. And we'll always have the Instagram, no matter what.'

Zach said: 'I'm glad I get to share her story because I want to remember her forever.'
