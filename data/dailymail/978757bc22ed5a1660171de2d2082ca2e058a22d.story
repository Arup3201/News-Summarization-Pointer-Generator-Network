Carl Froch believes George Groves does not have what it takes to become a world champion.

After suffering two defeats to Froch inside the last 12 months, Groves made a winning return to the ring on Saturday night.

Groves will get the chance to challenge Anthony Dirrell for the WBC belt, but Froch thinks the 26-year-old does not have the quality required to become the best in the world.

'To sum up George Groves, he is a giver, not a taker,' Froch told talkSPORT.

'He can dish punishment out and he is good on the offense, but he can’t take punishment.

'If you want to become a world champion and dominate at world level, you have to be able to take a punch. You have to be like myself, or Mikkel Kessler, or Jermain Taylor, or Jean Pascal, or Arthur Abraham - these fighters that go 12 rounds with me.

'I don’t think George Groves is tough enough. He may prove me wrong but, from what I saw the other night, I don’t see a future world champion at any sort of great level.'

George Groves was in control throughout but was unable to deliver the knockout blow against the Frenchman

The Londoner threw almost 1,000 punches to win by unanimous decision in front of a passionate home crowd
