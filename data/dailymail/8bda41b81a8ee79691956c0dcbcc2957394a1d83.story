A police chief has called for cyclists to be forced to wear number plates so they can be prosecuted more easily if they break the law.

Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said cyclists should have the same identification as drivers so they can be penalised in the same way if they go through traffic lights.

Mrs Bourne, who argued a few individuals 'ruin it for the many', said equal punishment for drivers and cyclists would 'make life easier'.

Speaking at a public meeting, she said: 'I would like to see cyclists wear some form of identification like cars have.

'This way when they go through traffic lights, you can actually identify them and then you can prosecute them for breaking the law.'

But Tony Green, of the Brighton and Hove Cycling Campaign, blasted the idea as 'totally unrealistic' for administrative and practical reasons.  

Mr Green, 67, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'Cyclists are seen as the easy target.

'I don't really know what it is, but maybe people think they are getting something for free.' 

Mrs Bourne, who added the idea was 'one for the legislators', said: 'It is something that has been at the back of my mind for a long time.

'Because when you use the road, if you are driving a car you have your number plate [to identify you].

'Other people register, they pay to use the roads and cyclists don't, admittedly, but there have been occasions when I have been sat at red lights and seen cyclists go through.

'And it is never the responsible cyclists that do this.

'The ones that belong to the clubs, they are great, they are the ones that adhere to all the laws, so it is the few that ruin it for the many.' 

Mr Green argued car drivers do not pay to use the road, despite common belief.

He said car tax (vehicle excise duty) goes into the central coffers, not the roads and road tax, which was abolished in 1937.

Mr Green added: 'I agree there are cyclists who break the law but then ten or one hundred times as many motorists break the law.'

Could this be the future? A woman poses with a bike featuring a number plate similar to those on cars. Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne says cyclists should be made to have identification like drivers so they can be penalised in the same way if they go through traffic lights
