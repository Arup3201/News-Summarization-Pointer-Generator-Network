An Indiana father who overdosed on heroin in a Cincinnati-area McDonald's play area he was at with his children was sentenced to six months behind bars on Monday.

Robert Palmer, 37, was sentenced by Hamilton County Municipal Judge Cheryl D. Grant, who last month convicted him on two misdemeanor counts after a nonjury trial.

Palmer, 37, and his girlfriend Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, of Dillsboro, Indiana were arrested after the fire department in Green Township responded to a call about two unresponsive adults March 9.

Authorities say one Jeffers was unconscious and not breathing, and Palmer was conscious but unresponsive. They recovered from what police say were 'life-threatening overdoses' of heroin. Jeffers was taken to Mercy West Hospital and later released.

Authorities say the couple admitted taking the drugs while with a five-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy.

Attorney Michael J. Trapp said Palmer hopes to serve his time and then begin picking up the pieces of his life.

'My client is very sorry that this happened,' Trapp said after the sentencing.

However, prosecutors said he showed little appreciation for the seriousness of his actions. Palmer will get credit for time served since his arrest, meaning he has a little less than five months left in jail.

His girlfriend, Tamica Jeffers, 33, is scheduled for a nonjury trial April 21 before a different judge.

After the overdoses, the McDonald's franchise owner and operator in suburban Green Township said he was proud that the restaurant crew and its customers took quick action to respond to the emergency and call 911 for medical help for the couple.
