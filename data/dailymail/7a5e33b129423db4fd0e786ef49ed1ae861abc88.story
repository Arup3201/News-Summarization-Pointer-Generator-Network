Pictured: Christopher Copeland, 51, leaves magistrates court today having been accused of keeping more than £500,000 he claimed was for Help for Heroes

An alleged conman accused of pocketing more than £560,000 he claimed to be collecting for the Help for Heroes charity was pictured for the first time today.

Christopher Copeland appeared in court to face 16 fraud charges. 

The 51 year old from Copplestone, Devon, pleaded not guilty to all 16 charges against him when he appeared before Central Devon magistrates court in Exeter.

One charge under the Proceeds of Crime Act alleges that he concealed criminal property of £518,397.

The other 15 counts of fraud relate to periods between 2009 and 2011 at supermarkets and other collecting points around Britain, where he allegedly falsely represented that he was collecting for the Help For Heroes charity.

It is claimed he gained more than £42,000 from counties across England and Wales including Surrey, Suffolk, Sussex, Oxfordshire, Caerphilly, London, Hertfordshire, Nottinghamshire, Monmouthshire, Northamptonshire and Staffordshire.

The total alleged fraud stands at £561,000.

Prosecutor Chris Bittlestone said the alleged charity frauds should be tried in Exeter Crown Court.

Tall, burly and grey bearded Copeland, who wore a check shirt and trousers, pleaded not guilty when asked to enter a plea by the court clerk.

Copeland was granted unconditional bail and will be committed to the crown court in July.

The charges arise out of an 18 month long police investigation.

Accusations: Copeland is alleged to have never sent the cash to the Help for Heroes personnel recovery centre, near Salisbury (pictured)

Help for Heroes is one of Britain's most popular charities, who say they are aware of the allegation involving Copeland

The charity Help for Heroes founded by Bryn and Emma Parry said they are aware of the alleged offences.

'Help For Heroes is aware of the offences alleged to have been committed by Mr Copeland', they said in a statement last month.

'The Great British public have shown amazing support since Help for Heroes was set up in 2007.'
