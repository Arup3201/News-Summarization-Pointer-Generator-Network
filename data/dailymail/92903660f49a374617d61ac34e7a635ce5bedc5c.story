He's a proud family man already, but President Barack Obama will turn to his children when it comes to life after the White House.

Sasha Obama could be the deciding factor in whether the first family stay in Washington once he leaves office in three years.

In a taped interview with ABC News, the President said his now 12-year-old daughter 'will have a big vote in where we are' because she will be a sophomore in high school.

When Obama leaves office in January 2017 after two terms, eldest daughter Malia could be off in college.

Both girls attend the exclusive Sidwell Friends School in northwest Washington, the same school Chelsea Clinton went to when Bill Clinton was president.

Obama said he and his wife, Michelle, have to make sure Sasha is doing well until she goes off to college.

'So we’ve gotta - you know - we gotta make sure that she’s doin’ well… until she goes off to college,' Obama told Barbara Walters.

'Sasha will have a big say in where we are.'

He suggested that no decisions have been made.

But he did hint that tearing Sasha away from her friends might be asking too much, saying his wife and daughters already have made 'a lot of sacrifices on behalf of my cockamamie ideas, the running for office and things'.

Current home: If the Obamas do stay in Washington and maintain a residence in the city, President Obama would be the first president to do so since Woodrow Wilson

In another portion of the interview, which aired Friday night on ABC's 20/20, Mrs. Obama says she tries not to tell her husband what to do because 'he's got enough people in his ear'.

If the Obamas do stay in Washington and maintain a residence in the city, President Obama would be the first president to do so since Woodrow Wilson.

Wilson, who was partly paralyzed from a stroke, is the only former president in U.S. history to maintain a residence in Washington, D.C., where he stayed until his death three years later.

'I try to stay out of his ear,' she said.

Mrs. Obama says she and the president treat their living quarters on the second floor of the White House like a sanctuary, particularly when their girls are home.

She says the girls like to talk about their day, which often has little to do with what's going on in the rest of the world.

'Everyone has to have their safe haven, a place of peace and calm and, you know, that's home for us,' the first lady said.
