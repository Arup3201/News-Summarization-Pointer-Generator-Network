Police in Florida are searching for a man suspected of driving a vehicle involved in a fiery hit-and-run crash that killed three Tampa Bay-area women.

St. Petersburg Police spokesman Mike Puetz said on Saturday that 27-year-old Marquice Lamonz Anderson is being sought on warrants that include charges of vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of an accident involving death, driving on a suspended license and violation of probation.

Authorities say Anderson was driving a four-door Chrysler 200 the wrong way down a street early Thursday morning when it crashed into a Saturn vehicle with three female occupants.

Two of the women — 23-year-old Briana Lequinda Campbell and 21-year-old Jamesia Chera Santoria Lang — remained in the burning car and were pronounced dead at the scene. A third, 25-year-old Grace Lashawn Collie, died at a Tampa hospital Friday.

WFLA reported that the women had six children between them.
