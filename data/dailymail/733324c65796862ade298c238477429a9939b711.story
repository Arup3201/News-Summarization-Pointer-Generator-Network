Justin Bieber has today denied he is retiring after claiming that he plans to take a break from the music industry.

The 19-year-old pop sensation brazenly told radio station Power 106 yesterday: 'After the new album, I'm actually
retiring man. I'm retiring.'

But source close to the singer - who is seen weeping in his new movie Believe - told MailOnline: 'Justin's going through a phase - no-one's worried. He's not retiring - he's being a little punk!

'Listen, he just raised $1.2million in the Philippines this week, his movie's premiering tonight, he has a new album - he's not going anywhere, everything's fine.'

Meanwhile, his management company have banned him from associating with 
former pals, Lil Za and Li Twist - who were today named in a law suit by

 young rappers spent much of their time at Bieber's $6.5million 
Calabasas home - until the star is believed to have kicked them out in September following a suspected jewellery theft - but a source admitted: 'They're not a great influence - 
Justin's management company don't want him hanging around with them.'

 Justin will attend the premiere of his new movie Believe, a follow-up to 2011's Never Say Never, in Hollywood 
and when asked if management were worried about the young star, the 
source added: 'Justin's doing his own thing, he's fine - he's not even 
20.'
