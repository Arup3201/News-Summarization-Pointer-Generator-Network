A video showing a mother from Trinidad and Tobago whipping her 12-year-old daughter with a belt for sharing sexually explicit photos of herself on Facebook has gone viral, sparking a national conversation in the island nation about corporal punishment.

Last Sunday, a video was posted on Facebook showing Helen Bartlett, a mother of four from Point Fortin, beating her sobbing daughter while hurling profanities at her.

The six-minute clip, which depicts Ms Bartlett raining blows on the 12-year-old girl, who whimpers in pain and cowers from the belt, has been shared more than 43,000 online.

Unsettling: The six-minute clip shows the mother whipping the girl with a belt as she whimpers in pain 

Discipline or abuse: The clip has gone viral on social media and sparked a public debate about corporal punishment

The unsettling clip has left viewers divided, with some people justifying the mother's actions, while others calling it child abuse.  

On Wednesday, Bartlett’s daughter and her older sister uploaded another video in response to the controversy, expressing support for their mother.

Looking into the camera, the two girls said Bartlett was a good mother who wanted to protect her child from teenage pregnancy, or worse. 

When Helen Bartlett was interviewed by a local radio station earlier this week, the woman declared she was 'prepared to go to jail' to set her wayward young daughter on the right path, Trinidad Express reported.  

Asked if she regretted her actions, Ms Bartlett, who has three girls and a boy, said she stood by her mode of discipline, but she was sorry that the video intended to shame her 12-year-old has gained such notoriety.

Ms Bartlett explained that since the girl's father, a police officer, left them, the child has been unmanageable.

The single mother added that she has exhausted all avenues trying to keep her daughter on the straight and narrow, including seeking counselling for her.

And according to Ms Bartlett, the 12-year-old's father has been of no help, telling the girl that he wanted nothing to do with her.

Defiant: The single mother said she is prepared to go to jail for meting out corporal punishment to her wayward daughter

What sparked the brutal beating last Sunday in the Bartletts’ apartment was a salacious text message exchange between the 12-year-old girl and a boy her age, who was trying to convince her to have sex with him.

After the mother read the messages, she accessed her underage daughter's Facebook profile and discovered photos of the girl posing 'seductively' in her underwear.

Helen Bartlett explained that while her child is pretty and intelligent, she has a low self-esteem and is susceptible to peer pressure.

Her worst fear is that if the 12-year-old continues down this road, one day she is either going to come home pregnant, or will end up dead on the streets.

On mom's side: The 12-year-old came out in defense of her mother, saying in a counter video that she knows Bartlett loves he dearly

‘I stand firmly by my decision. I will go to jail for it,’ the woman said. ‘I know people are saying the authorities should charge me for abuse.’

Asked about her daughter's state of mind following the release of the controversial video, Ms Bartlett said the girl was coping 'unexpectedly well.'

In her response video, the daughter said she knew her mother loves her dearly, and she reassured the viewers that has no intention of killing herself because she loves herself 'too much.'

The girl has not been to school since the video went viral, and her mother said she has been preparing her for potential bullying and mockery from her classmates.

Defending Helen Bartlett's old-school brand of discipline, her older daughter explained in her counter video that with their father not around anymore, there is no male figure in the family to set her out-of-control sibling straight.

‘The road my sister was heading down was teenaged pregnancy,’ she said. ‘She saw this as a way she could stop it. My sister has learnt her lesson.’

Speaking out for the first time since the incident, the 12-year-old at the center of the firestorm said: ‘I am very sorry for bringing shame on you and the family. I know you love me dearly. And I love you dearly, too.’

The girl then appealed to other children her age, urging them to watch the video of her beating and learn from it.

Extreme measures: The mother stated that she decided to teach her daughter a lesson so that one day she wouldn't come home pregnant or end up dead

‘You are a special piece of God’s puzzle,’ the girl said. ‘And don’t let what happen to me happen to you also.’

The incident sparked a heated public debate in Trinidad and Tobago over the issue of corporal punishment, and whether Helen Bartlett’s actions displayed in the video crossed the line.

According to Jamaica Observer, Trinidad and Tobago's Ministry of Gender, Youth and Child Development has weighed in on the issue, calling on parents to use 'non-physical forms of discipline.'
