Hospital managers behind one of the worst health scandals in living memory won glowing praise from the head of the NHS.

At the height of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, Sir David Nicholson toured wards and in a follow-up letter said ‘well done’ for ‘progress in target areas’.

The visit came in October 2005 – a year in which 300 patients are thought to have died because of poor care. By 2009, the total stood at 1,200.

Bereaved families, who are calling for Sir David to quit, say many lives could have been spared had he investigated the health trust.

In other developments in the NHS crisis:

The letter obtained by the Mail shows the NHS chief visited Mid Staffordshire’s two hospitals – Stafford and Cannock Chase – while he was in charge of the regional health board.

It is thought the visit was on October 27 and was followed by a letter of congratulation to the chief executive.

It noted improvements on hitting targets for waiting times in casualty, cancer treatment, surgery and outpatients.

Yet that month an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke was sent home by a casualty doctor who misdiagnosed her as having a urine infection.

She fell into a coma two days later and died.

Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother died at the trust, said: ‘He should have been asking questions of the trust’s chief executive, not congratulating him.

‘The care was just disastrous from 2004 and it became a longstanding problem. He is ultimately responsible. How can he carry on in his job after all this?’

Last week Sir David was implicated in another scandal when it emerged he had ignored warnings about a hospital trust where 670 patients may have died needlessly.

Gary Walker and David Bowles, the former chief executive and chairman of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, say they wrote to the chief executive in 2009 but were ignored.

Mr Walker was later sacked and given a £500,000 pay-off with a gagging clause to keep silent. The trust is being investigated by the NHS for having one of the highest death rates in the country.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister added to the pressure by saying the NHS needed to act on problems ‘much more swiftly’.

Mr Cameron said there had been ‘no accountability’ for the failings at Mid Staffordshire with those responsible being allowed to quietly retire or move on.

Speaking from Mumbai, he added: ‘There wasn’t proper accountability. There weren’t proper consequences and that is not acceptable.’

Last week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote to all health trusts urging them not to use gagging orders to deter whistleblowing.

Asked about this, the Prime Minister said: ‘I agree with what Jeremy Hunt has said over the last couple of days. You shouldn’t need to rely on whistleblowing in the NHS, we should be discovering problems much more swiftly. We should be discovering them as they occur.’

Mr Cameron said the Government was trying to get hospital trusts to provide better care by asking patients whether they would recommend them to their friends and family.

But he made clear where this fails, there is a case for whistleblowing: ‘That’s what the transparency agenda is about. That’s what the friends and family test is about, that’s what boosting the Care Quality Commission is all about. That’s what the chief inspector of hospitals is all about.

Sir David has been facing increasing calls to resign since a report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal was published earlier this month.

Sir David also appointed the trust’s failed chief executive Martin Yeates – even though he had no formal managerial training and went on to sack 50 nurses.

Later, as chief executive of the Department of Health, he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives. He apparently told a watchdog investigating the hospital trust not to pay too much attention to the concerns of the families as they were ‘simply lobbying’.

Up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire and many hundreds of others suffered ‘inhumane’ and ‘inexcusable’ care.

Sir David, who earns £211,000 a year, has resisted calls to resign, saying the failures have been ‘system wide’.

But last week two Tory MPs from the health select committee, Chris Skidmore and Sarah Wollaston, urged him to consider his position.

An online petition on a Government website calling on him to go has received 3,796 signatures.

A spokesman for Sir David Nicholson said: ‘Sir David took on responsibility for the Shropshire and Staffordshire Health Authority for just ten months, along with being chief executive of two other health authorities.

‘There was no information that he saw during that time that alerted him to the problems at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.’
