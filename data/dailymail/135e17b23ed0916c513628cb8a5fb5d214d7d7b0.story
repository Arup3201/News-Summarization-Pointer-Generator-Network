WELCOME TO JUST A MINUTE by Nicholas Parsons (Canongate, £20) 

Back in the summer, I made my own wireless debut — Woman’s Hour. I also made the mistake of telling everyone what an absolute piece of cake jabbering on the radio was. Because it is. Writing is what’s hard — facing the blank sheet every morning.

I was reminded of all this when leafing through Nicholas Parsons’ ‘celebration of Britain’s best-loved radio comedy’, Just A Minute — because what is that programme, after all, other than the requirement to talk drivel for up to 60 seconds on, say, ‘finding a caterpillar in my salad’.

To date there have been 900 editions. Parsons has long been the chairman, and he has a genius for keeping control over the teams, who can get quite temperamental. He was defeated only by Wendy Richard, who was persistently crotchety and guilty of ‘poisoning the atmosphere and inhibiting the audience’. Indeed, Paul Merton refused to go on the show if Wendy was hired.

Nevertheless, there is something ineffably English about the whole radio panel game genre that I find faintly depressing. Like many a quiz programme, it is redolent of jigsaws on wet afternoons, flickering coal fires, tinned peaches for tea, dull journeys in the car. It is genial and happily mindless, with, under the surface, considerable competitiveness and animosity.

Kenneth Williams was more or less demented when put behind a microphone. Bombastic and impatient, he shrieked his way through 344 episodes.

Parsons gives us a moving and perceptive account of Williams’ contributions — and touches on something far darker, which is the notion that the great Carry On star committed suicide because he felt trapped in a panel game hell.

Kenneth shrieked his way through 344 episodes of the show

Williams had worked with Olivier and Orson Welles, so in doing all this wireless work he felt he’d wasted his life ‘making a noise that floats up into the air and disappears’. It makes alarming reading now, seeing his comments and interjections in cold print and realising that Williams was making comic capital out of a genuine despair. Though it was mock outrage, it was real at some level: ‘Oh, I’m so bored!’ ‘I don’t care! Shut your row!’, etc. Parsons refers to Williams’ ‘precarious ego’ and says he ‘performed wonderfully, in a mad, anarchic manner’, but if we compare the quotations in this book with the screams and howls found in his diaries and letters, what listeners heard was a man teetering on the edge of an abyss like a porcelain cup about to drop off the shelf.

Derek Nimmo, fondly remembered by Parsons, was a panellist of long standing. Though born in Liverpool and raised in a caravan, Nimmo re-invented himself as an affable toff — a sort of sexless Leslie Phillips — who played stammering comedy vicars in sitcoms and at BBC parties had his drinks served in a silver chalice by a personal butler.

Nimmo has been reincarnated, and replaced on the show, by the versatile good egg Gyles Brandreth. Gyles can talk about ‘the things in my wallet’ until the cows come home. Indeed, he holds the Guinness World Record for making a 12-hour non-stop speech. He wore a surgical appliance so that he could urinate at the podium. I was fascinated to be told in this book that ‘the Duke of Edinburgh has one’. Keep that in mind when you next see him taking the salute.

Just A Minute began in 1967, when the BBC policy was you couldn’t make jokes about lavatories or effeminacy in men. Now they do nothing else.

Parsons grasped that ‘the point and fun of the game comes out of those challenges and not from a brilliant exposition of one minute’.

True — but it rather dooms this book, because the atmosphere of the programme cannot be captured or evoked on the page. The show is ‘instantaneous comedy’, with no scripts or re-takes. ‘You hear what happened’ — and in truth very little merits preservation, save the late Linda Smith’s description of plastic surgery addict Joan Rivers as ‘a Siamese cat walking into a gale’.
