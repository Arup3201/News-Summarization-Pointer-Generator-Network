Two men questioned over a terrifying raid on Ian Wright's house have been told they will face no further action.

The two men, aged 40 and 32 were arrested following the horrific burglary on June 18 in Kensal Rise, north London. 

A third man, aged 34, remains on bail and has to present himself to a North London police station in October where a decision will be made whether to charge him in connection with the incident.

A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that an investigation into the aggravated burglary is continuing.

Wright was in Brazil working for ITV during the World Cup when four men burst into his north London home, threatening his wife Nancy, 39, and daughters, aged two and four.

The thugs threatened to cut off the fingers of his daughters unless Mrs Wright handed over enough valuables.

The four men armed with knives, forced their way into the house before terrorising the family.

The four suspects are described as black men aged between 18-25 and speak with London accents. They were all wearing dark clothing with their faces covered by hoodies. 

The former Arsenal and England player flew home from Brazil after the robbery, which took place at 9.20pm on August 18. 

The gang stole Wright's MBE, as well as a watch gifted to him from Arsenal hero Dennis Bergkamp and a special watch from the club. 

The gang told Mrs Wright that they would cut off her fingers and the fingers of her two daughters if she did not comply.

Luckily the two youngsters remained asleep during the ordeal. 

Wright was awarded an MBE in 2000 by the Queen for his services to football.

When he left Arsenal, Wright had overtaken Cliff Bastin as Arsenal's all-time record goal scorer, although he has since been overtaken by Thierry Henry. 

Speaking outside his home soon after the robber, the former striker said: 'All I want to say really is me and my missus, my girls, everyone's safe. The police are trying to get on with what they are doing.' 

Wright added: 'What's really disappointing is they're from an age group I've worked with and tried to help.' 

Any witnesses or anyone with any information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
