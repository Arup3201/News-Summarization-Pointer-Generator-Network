A lorry driver has admitted killing two colleagues who were taking part in a charity ride from Land’s End to John O’Groats last summer.

Andrew McMenigall, 47, and Toby Wallace, 36, died in the crash on the A30 in Newquay, Cornwall in July last year, only a few dozen miles into their ride to raise money for a colleague who had died of cancer.

Robert Palmer, 32, pleaded guilty to causing the deaths of  Mr McMenigall, a father-of-two, and Cambridge graduate Mr Wallace, by dangerous driving.

Tragedy: Toby Wallace 36, left, and Andrew McMenigall, 47,  died in a crash on the A30 near Newquay, Cornwall, just 40 miles into their 960-mile long charity bike ride, in July last year

Following Palmer’s plea, the widows of Mr McMenigall and Mr Wallace, released a joint statement speaking of their loss.

Claire
 Wallace and Anne McMenigall also hit out at UK transport laws, saying 
they are too lenient and that it is too difficult to bring the 
responsible of road incidents to justice.

‘There
 are no words to describe the devastation and loss that we, and both 
families, feel following the deaths of our husbands, they were 
exceptional and giant men in every sense of the word,’ Mrs Wallace and Mrs McMenigall said.

‘It
 is a tragedy that so many other families are also mourning loved ones 
who have been killed on Britain’s roads, particularly when many of these
 deaths were completely avoidable.

‘So
 many of these families do not ever see this charge brought against the 
person who has killed their husband, their child, their brother, their 
father.'

Heartbreaking: Lorry driver Robert Palmer, 32, has admitted causing the deaths of Mr McMenigall, a father-of-two, and Cambridge graduate Mr Wallace

‘UK transport laws 
are lenient, charges are difficult and onerous to attain and less and 
less resource is being dedicated to road traffic collisions.

‘We would like to thank everyone who has supported us and been involved in getting us this far.

‘Toby
 and Andrew loved cycling, we believe that the rise in the popularity of
 the sport must be met by those with the responsibility to improve our 
transport infrastructure and improve education for drivers. ‘

Mr
 McMenigall lived in Edinburgh with Anne and their two children, 
Jennifer, aged 15, and 12-year-old Lucy. He was a keen triathlete and 
had previously served as an officer in the Army before joining Aberdeen Asset Management (AAM).

Mr
 Wallace lived in Philadelphia with his wife, where he worked for AAM. 
He was born in the UK, went to school in Southampton and studied at 
Cambridge University before working in London, Sydney and the US.

Mr Wallace was part of an eight-man team who rowed across the Atlantic last year to raise money for charity.

Their
 bike ride was to raise money for the Kirsten Scott Memorial Trust, 
named after a 25-year-old colleague who died from cancer in 2011.

Mr
 McMenigall was also raising money for It’s Good 2 Give, an 
Edinburgh-based charity that offers support to people with cancer and 
their families. One of his daughters had been diagnosed with and 
recovered from a brain tumour.

Heartbreaking: On Tuesday, the widows of the two cyclists released a statement saying there are 'no words to describe the devastation and loss that we, and both families, feel following the deaths of our husbands'

The pair were 40 miles into the 960-mile bike ride to raise money for two charities when they were struck by Palmer’s lorry.

Palmer,
 of Bude, Cornwall also pleaded guilty during a hearing at Truro Crown 
Court to a further count of dangerous driving in relation to another 
crash in September on the A30 near Okehampton.

Palmer was released on conditional bail for the preparation of reports. He will be sentenced on September 1.

In
 a statement released at the time of their deaths, the families of Mr 
McMenigall and Mr Wallace thanked members of the public who donated to 
the charities following the deaths.

‘Members of the public were there when the accident happened and did everything they could to help,’ they said.

‘The
 emergency services were on the scene within minutes and did a valiant 
job. It must have been tremendously upsetting for the witnesses and the 
emergency services, and we want to thank them for everything they did.

‘We
 have been touched by the generosity of people from around the world; 
people who had never met Andrew or Toby but have been making donations 
in their memory. Their kindness has been truly overwhelming.

‘We’d
 also like to thank the Pro-Am players from the Aberdeen Asset 
Management Scottish Open who donated their prize money, and the European
 Tour who matched the funds.’

The pair were hoping to raise £10,000 for the two charities. Donations have now exceeded that more than five-fold.
