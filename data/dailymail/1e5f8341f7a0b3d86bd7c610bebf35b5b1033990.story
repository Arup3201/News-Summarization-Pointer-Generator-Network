Police were called to a Texas highway early on Sunday morning because concerned citizens saw a young boy riding his bike alongside cars and trucks.

They then discovered that the boy was running away from a very dysfunctional home.

The seven-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, eventually told police where he lived and they escorted him back to his home where they spoke with his mother, Tamara Ruth Whitt, and her father, Edgar Dale Whitt.

Not only were they allegedly abusive to the boy and his two siblings, but they were also believed to be involved in an incestuous relationship with each other.

During their talk with the responding officers, the Whitts said that the seven-year-old, along with his five-year-old and two-year-old siblings, had all been in straitjackets.

‘They didn’t know how he got out,’ the police report states.

A continued investigation into the family suggested that Edgar, 54, and Tamara, 26, had a sexual relationship and were the parents of the two-year-old boy found in the Howard County home.

Sheriff Stan Parker confirmed to MailOnline that while Tamara was the mother of all three children, Edgar was the father of only the 2-year-old.

‘I've really never seen anything like this before in Howard County,’ Mr Parker said.

Dangerous at night: Concerned citizens called police after they spotted a 7-year-old boy riding his bike on Highway 87 at 1.36am on Sunday

The
Whitts have lived in the Big Spring area, about five hours drive 
west of Dallas, for just two years.

This makes it difficult for police 
officials to collect a detailed family history.

The children have all been taken into the custody of Children's Protective Services.

Both Tamara and her father were charged with child endangerment, and he was also charged with prohibited sexual conduct with a descendant, which is a second-degree felony.

They are now in Howard County Jail and the case has been handed over to the District Attorney’s office.
