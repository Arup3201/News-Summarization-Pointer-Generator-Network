'As part of this investigation I am appealing to former pupils who may have information about the offences under investigation or who may want to speak to us about similar matters to come forward.

'I want to reassure anyone who might 
want to report any incidents or offences that we treat all allegations 
of sexual abuse extremely seriously and in the strictest confidence and 
we have officers on hand to deal with complaints swiftly and 
sympathetically.'
