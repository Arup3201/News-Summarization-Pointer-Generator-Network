You’ve settled into your fancy hotel room – pillows fluffed, complimentary chocolates eaten, room service on order.

There’s just one problem. The room is absolutely freezing.

You attempt to crank up the heat as far as the hotel will allow it to go- but it still isn’t warm enough.

Scroll down for video...

The trick allows you to get into the VIP mode on an INNCOM thermostat which overrides its temperature range and turns off the motion sensor

If you’re like most people, you’ll grab a jumper and a hot drink and make do.

But one cunning traveller has found a way to get around the problem using a technique that overrides the hotel’s thermostat.

The Points, Miles and Martinis blog describes a code that works for all INNCOM thermostats.

INNCOM systems, created by heating controls group  Honeywell, are installed in more than 1,000,000 hotel rooms worldwide including Hilton hotels.

To override the thermostat hold down the ‘display’ button and at the same time press the ‘off’ key.

Release off while continuing to hold down display, and press the ‘up’ arrow button. Then release all the buttons.

If the screen shows ‘VIP’ you have successfully overridden the thermostat.

The VIP mode turns off the motion sensor and allows a lower and higher range of the thermostat.

Now you can kick back, enjoy room service and be as toasty or as cool as you want.

To override the thermostat hold down the 'display' button and at the same time press the ¿off¿ key. Release off while continuing to hold down display, and press the 'up' arrow button. Then release all the buttons
