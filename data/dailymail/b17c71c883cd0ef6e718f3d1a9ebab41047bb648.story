Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain believes team-mate Alexis Sanchez deserves all the plaudits after his double helped the Gunners on their way to a 3-0 win over Stoke.

Sanchez's first was a brilliant solo effort in the 33rd minute, having earlier set up Laurent Koscielny for the opener, before netting a deflected free-kick at the start of the second half.

The Chile forward, signed for £30million in the summer from Barcelona, took his tally in an impressive debut campaign to 18 and Oxlade-Chamberlain has no doubts he is a game-changer for Arsenal.

Alexis Sanchez continued his run of brilliant form with an assist and a goal during the first 45 minutes

The England midfielder told Sky Sports: 'He is amazing. He shows it week in, week out and I think that's the most important thing.

'For the top players it's about consistency and not just about being good one week but every week. And I think Alexis has done that all the way through this season.

'He was brilliant again against Stoke, got two good goals and set Laurent's goal up as well. Hopefully it continues for him because he's having a great season and his confidence is brimming and that helps the team as well.

'There were a lot of good performances out there but with his two goals and the assist he's the star.'

Oxlade-Chamberlain added: 'We knew we had to start well on Sunday.

'It was important who got the first goal and we knew if we could get that we'd put the pressure on from there.

'In the first half we did well, managed to get a good goal and then the game went really well for us - not just for the boys up front, but also the boys at the back defended really well and gave us the base to go and push on.'
