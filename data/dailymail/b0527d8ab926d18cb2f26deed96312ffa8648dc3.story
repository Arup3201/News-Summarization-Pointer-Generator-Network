A woman's body has been found in the backyard of a home in Budgewoi, on the NSW Central Coast

Emergency services were called to the address at about 12.15am on Wednesday, responding to reports of a woman had been found severely injured

Police from Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Command established a crime scene after they discovered the body of a woman believed to be aged in her 40s or 50s.

Mr Weigand was taken to Wyong Hospital for assessment before being taken to Wyong Police Station where he was charged with murder.

Neighbour Margaret Wright, who has lived in the street and known Mr Weigand for 23 years, said he had been in a relationship with the victim for about six months after meeting her at a dancing event at a local club.

'Honestly I got such a shock,' Mrs Wright told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's just tragic it had to happen, I feel sorry for her. 

Police reportedly said the woman was beaten so badly she was unrecognisable

'She seemed quite a nice lady - she used to be quiet but she'd say good morning.'

Mrs Wright said she did not live at the Sonoma Road house but she used to stay overnight.

'He said they used to watch videos and everything like that,' she said.

'Sometimes they'd go down the club and they'd have a bit of dinner

'I would see them, the courtesy bus would pick them up one or two nights a week.'

Mrs Wright said she believed Mr Weigand, who was on the pension, had an intellectual disability.

'He couldn't read and he couldn't write,' she said.

'Some days he'd say “How are you going?” and want to talk and other times he would ignore you.'
