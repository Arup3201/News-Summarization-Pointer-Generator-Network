Not content with creating a pair of fake legs so gamers can simulate lying on a girlfriend’s lap, Japanese developers have now gone a step further.

Designers at Up Frontier have created a model with a fake pair of breasts that is fitted with pressure sensors, and connects to an Oculus Rift headset.

When the wearer squeezes the model's breasts, a virtual character squeals with shock and places her arms over her chest.

A video of the breast simulator recently appeared on Japanese video share platform Nico Nico, in which a user called Ryuto was seen testing the breast simulator.

In the video, Ryuto sees an image of the virtual girl on the Oculus Rift headset.

Oculus was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey.

It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well.

Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved.

The firm is developing the leading VR headset - with a developer version on sale for $350 (£210).

It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg

The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who have already unveiled their own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year. 

As the player’s virtual hands close over the virtual girlfriend’s breasts, in the real world their hands are actually closing on the model bust.

This is designed to make the experience visual and tactile.

Upon squeezing the breasts - which are made using foam from a novelty mouse pad - the girl squeals with shock, covers her chest with her arms, and turns her eyes to the ground.

It was created by the same firm that created a virtual reality girlfriend with fake legs.

When wearing the headset, owners of the lap can rest their head on the virtual girl's legs and talk to her.

Using a video-game controller they can also stand up and walk around, but if they stray too far from the girl she will give them a 'roundhouse kick.'

The Oculus Rift headset has been handed out to independent developers to come up with modifications.

A commercial version of the headset is due to go on sale at the start of next year.

And the virtual reality breast groping headset, complete with model, will be on display at Japan's Oculus Rift Festival taking place this weekend.
