Early evening but the sky is already ink black over New Bolsover in Derbyshire, and the thick November fog is slowly lifting. Even so, the Skinner household is incredibly easy to spot.

As you drive through the streets lined with brick terraces, past the social club and allotments, it leaps out at you. Parts can even be seen from a mile away.

Let’s face it, there are probably astronauts in the International Space Station who can pinpoint this address.

Because this little two-bedroom, mid-terrace house doesn’t so much shout ‘Christmas!’ as scream ‘Christmas!!!’ like an over-excited elf who’s had one too many sherries.

Wayne Skinner, pictured, from Bolsover, Derbyshire covered his home in Christmas lights to raise money for the local Air Ambulance service 

Covering the entire front of the home are thousands of twinkling lights, while a 6ft plastic Santa stands sentry outside the front door.

Dotted around him are geographically challenged penguins, glowing snowmen, and flashing stars and snowflakes. There’s even a blue-and-white reindeer — not from Lapland, but a warehouse in Wigan — whose flashing red nose was once a fire alarm.

A 20ft Christmas tree bedecked in even more lights looms from the front garden, and icicles dangle from three metal arches propped against the front wall.

Subtle, it ain’t. But for 26-year-old Wayne Skinner, whose labour of love this is, it’s a source of much pride and hundreds of hours of hard work.

‘To those people who’ve said it looks tacky or cheap, I say: “You try putting up something like this,” ’ he tells me.

‘The children and families who come to look at it absolutely love it. And we’re doing it for a good cause, so I don’t see what the problem is.’

The good cause this year is the local Air Ambulance Service, which will receive the money that the visitors who come to gawp at the spectacle are encouraged to donate in a box outside the house.

Of course, the display — lit from 4pm to 9.30pm each evening — is not to everyone’s taste.

Wayne’s father John, who is outside greeting onlookers while wearing a red elf’s hat and Christmas tree jumper, confides that some of the neighbours have been a ‘little bit bah humbug’ about the whole thing.

‘I don’t understand it because all we’re doing is giving something back to the community,’ he says.

But the neighbours I speak to are more diplomatic. ‘It can be a little distracting with the lights sometimes, because they’re so bright, and what with us having little ones to put to bed,’ says Lynsey Greveson, who lives a few doors down.

‘But they’ve been doing it for as long as we’ve been here, and they’re doing it for charity.’

Another neighbour, Philip Ratcliffe, adds: ‘When they turn it on, it makes our lights flicker. But I don’t think anyone round here is going to be bothered about something for charity.’

Someone who is bothered, however, is the street’s postwoman. She refuses to walk down the Skinners’ 8ft long path for ’elf and safety reasons — fearing she may trip over a penguin’s flipper or reindeer antler.

The extravagant display, with at least 20,000 bulbs,  is lit between 4pm to 9.30pm every night and adds £500 to the quarterly electricity bill 

Instead, the family have had to fix an American-style postbox on their front wall for her to use.

But for the endless stream of people who pull up in their cars to take photos or just gawp, the display brings some welcome winter cheer and ‘a little bit of Blackpool’ to the area.

In fact, some of the lights — including the large Santa, teddy and mouse — have come from the Blackpool Illuminations. They were bought by Wayne for £100 each when the Golden Mile had a sale in 2008. One onlooker says wistfully: ‘I’d love my house to look like this.’ Another adds: ‘I want one of those flashing reindeers.’

Wayne says his lightbulb moment came in 2002 after he put up a few Christmas lights at the front of his family’s house and they started attracting attention.

Each year he has added more and more lights — and the display is now so big it even has its own switching on ceremony a month before Christmas, complete with shire horses pulling a sleigh containing his mum Susan dressed as Mrs Santa.

Wayne — a trainee electrician who works full-time at a local DIY store — starts putting his light show together in October. He spends several hours a day on it for seven weeks until it’s complete. He has no idea how many bulbs he uses, but ‘there must be at least 20,000’.

The most expensive piece, costing more than £200, is his all new, all sparkly matrix board with 322 lights.

‘They’re like the ones you see on The X Factor,’ he enthuses proudly. ‘You can programme them to make lots of different pictures, such as sleighs and Space Invaders.’

The white star at the top of the house was sold off by the council because it was damaged and couldn’t be used on a public street. Other pieces have been donated or picked up from auctions, end-of-year sales and the internet.

The Christmas theme carries on inside the house, and will remain in place until January 5 - and will take to mid February to fully dismantle

Though Wayne is on the minimum wage, he has spent hundreds of pounds — perhaps even thousands — on making his display as magical as possible for passers by.

What’s less magical is the electricity bill, which is footed by his dad. ‘It costs him £500 for the quarter — but that’s for everything in the house, too, including the heating,’ says Wayne.

‘It was worse before we went on to LED lights, which are more energy efficient. We’d eat up a lot of energy then, even though we didn’t use the kettle, cooker or shower while the lights were on in case we blew a fuse.’

Last year, a kindly electrician installed a new fuse box for free so the charity display wouldn’t have such a big impact on the household’s day-to-day living. But it hasn’t quite solved the problem.

‘There’s only one main cable that comes into the house, so we still don’t use the cooker while the lights are on — it could be a bit dicey,’ says Wayne.

‘We boil the kettle and use a Thermos flask so we can have cups of tea throughout the evening.’

Amazingly, the festive overload continues inside. A wall-mounted plastic fish sings Paul McCartney’s Wonderful Christmastime at full blast to anyone who steps through the front door.

After squeezing through the narrowest of hallways, you arrive in a living room festooned with decorations.

There’s also a split-screen monitor showing CCTV footage from a camera hidden behind the ear of the snowman outside. An onlooker quips: ‘You have to around here — if you left your shoes on the floor, someone would nick ’em.’

In the front room, Wayne has set up an 8ft long Victorian village snow scene, complete with moving figures dancing away to Greensleeves. ‘I wanted something just for me that wasn’t anything to do with the lights outside,’ he says.

Hanging from the ceilings are hundreds of baubles. ‘We kept some of them up all year because we never got round to taking them down,’ says Wayne.

The house might not be appearing in House Beautiful magazine any time soon but, as Wayne proudly shows me the spaghetti of circuitry and wiring needed to make the entire operation run like clockwork, there’s no denying the level of skill involved.

And it’s not only the vibrant visual display that he has to think about. Every year he arranges a jingly soundtrack to co-ordinate with the lights.

This year, Frozen’s Let It Go seems to be the people pleaser. ‘The music is on very low — so we don’t have to have the speakers at a million decibels, we have a low-range transmitter set at 93FM so people parked outside can listen to it on their car radios.’

Wayne, a self-confessed electronics geek, starts telling me about transformers, trip switches and breakers. It all sounds awfully technical. But he’s also super-safety-conscious.

‘As it’s a fire hazard, we never turn on the lights without someone being in the house,’ he says. ‘And I keep all the wiring cool with a fan so it doesn’t overheat. I know what I’m doing.’

So far, his displays have raised £2,000 for charities — including the Motor Neurone Disease Association and SANDS stillbirth charity, after a family friend lost her baby.

This year’s display will remain until Twelfth Night (January 5), when Wayne will start the laborious task of taking it all down. He should finish in the middle of February, depending on the weather.

Then every single light and fitting is crammed inside the tiny house — meaning the Skinners have to squeeze past a 6ft Santa on the landing even in the middle of July.

But by then, Wayne’s already planning the next extravaganza.
