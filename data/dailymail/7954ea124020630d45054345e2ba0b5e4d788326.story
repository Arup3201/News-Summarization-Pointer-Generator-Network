Powerful data: But Wikipedia relies on editors to keep the site updated and regulated

It is often said that history is written by the victors.

But now anyone with a web connection - and perhaps an axe to grind - can influence how they are remembered.

For where once politicians were required to call on the power of their rhetoric to sway voters, now they have the power of the internet at their disposal - and it seems they aren't afraid to use it to their advantage.

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has discovered almost 10,000 individual examples of people inside the ouses of Parliament directly editing Wikipedia articles.

Sometimes the edits seem to be settling old scores - such as the edit by one user who added a reference to union leader Bob Crow's 'massive salary'.

Other edited entries appear to be simple ego-stroking, such as the entry for Labour MP Fabian 
Hamilton.

His entry was edited from within one of the Houses to claim that he was subjected to ‘an unfair, 
personally targeted campaign from his political opponents who used 
exaggerated expenses claims and false information to attempt to 
discredit a powerful incumbent who has served Leeds North East for many 
years’.

Meanwhile, some edits seem an attempt to reduce some of
the embarrassment caused by the expenses scandals, such as on the 
Wikipedia entry for MP Clare Short.

The paragraph that said 'Clare Short 
admitted that she overclaimed £8,000 worth of expenses on her home and 
like many other MPs claimed it was a mistake and blamed it on Commons 
officials', was rewritten to read that she had ‘confirmed that in 2006 
the fees office had asked her to repay £8,000, because for three years 
they had erroneously paid her full mortgage, rather than just the 
interest’.

Contacted by The Independent, Ms Short 
said her staff were ‘angry and protective’ about inaccurate and negative
entires on her Wikipedia page and said it was quite possible that they 
have been responsible for the changes.

But, she said: ‘It certainly wasn’t me. I never look at it. I find it too irritating.

'The only change I know was made to my page was my grandchildren adding their names in.’

And finally, some edits seem to be simply frivolous, especially as they emanate from the building in charge of the country. Example include the edits from Parliament about the legal status of Pringles (are they crisp or cake?) or edits to the biographical data of Molly Weasley - a character from the Harry Potter series.

House of Edits: Entries for MPs Clare Short and Joan Ryan were edited from within the Houses of Parliament

On a lighter, crunchier note, someone from one of the Houses took the time to update the Pringles page

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 
which carried out the investigation on behalf of the Independent, found 
that nearly one in six MPs have had their online Wikipedia entires 
changed from within Parliament, and dozens of the alterations appear to 
be attempts to erase embarrassing or disputed allegations made during 
the 2009 expenses scandal.

The bureau said all internet users inside the Houses of Parliament are routed through two previously identified IP addresses - unique numeric identifiers that act as a digital fingerprint.

Wikipedia keeps a comprehensive log of every alteration ever made, with a record of which user or IP address was responsible. The bureau was then able to match Parliament's two IP addresses with the edits, and found almost 10,000 edits.

According to the bureau, one of the most persistent and successful attempts to edit information was made to the page of Joan Ryan, who stepped down as a Labour MP in 2010.

In 2009, the Daily Telegraph reported 
that Ryan had claimed more than £4,500 for work on her home in her 
Enfield constituency, before switching her designated second home to a 
flat in south London.

At least 10 attempts have been made from computers in Parliament to remove information about Ryan’s expenses claims and a further 20 efforts to delete the information, some from her constituency of Enfield, have also been recorded in Wikipedia’s logs.

The sustained effort proved successful as there is now no mention of Ms Ryan’s Parliamentary expenses on her Wikipedia page.

When contacted by the Bureau, she admitted to having altered information, but said: ‘I’ve altered it whenever there’s misleading or untruthful information been placed on it’.

'Enormous salary': Union leader Bob Crow's entry was edited

Some of the thousands of parliamentary edits found by the Bureau include:

In 2008, a user mentioned on the article of Andrew Marr that he 
had taken out a superinjunction. Discussing standing legal injunctions 
is a potential contempt of court

Seven changes to the ‘Laws about Incest’ page, helpfully listing the jurisdictions where it’s legal

One user reduced the minimum number of women forced into sexual 
slavery by the Japanese during World War II from 60,000 to 10,000

RMT secretary Bob Crow was the victim of an article edit which was changed to include a comment about his ‘massive salary’

An article on Chris Huhne’s register of interests was edited to note that they no longer include gold mining companies

In 2006, an editor of Huhne’s article removed a line about him 
being one of a number of signatories to a letter declaring no confidence
in Charles Kennedy

Spelling errors were corrected in a passage discussing whether Pringles were legally recognised as crisps or cakes

One lobby-goer correctly observed that Former London May Ken Livingstone’s last name is indeed ‘Livingstone’ and not ‘T*atface’

One individual edited the entry on The Lord of the Rings to 
describe it as ‘12 hours of utter tripe about some little bender running
around trying to find a ring with his equally benderish mates’

MP Michael Fabricant was included in a list of ‘Notable DJs'.

Ryan insisted at the time that this did not constitute ‘flipping’ her second home since she had not made any claims for redecoration or refurbishment on her south London flat, which would have allowed her to claim the maximum to which she was entitled.

Valuable web resource: Jimmy Wales co-founded Wikipedia

In another case six attempts were made over 2006 and 2007 to redact a passage detailing a comment given by the MP Philip Davies to the Sun newspaper for a 2006 article claiming that Muslims had been responsible for an act of vandalism.

Mr Davies told the paper: ‘If there’s anyone who should f**k off it’s the Muslims who do this sort of thing’.

Other users of the site promptly reinserted the passage each time.

When approached by the Bureau, Mr Davies denied involvement.

He said: ‘No, it certainly was not me who either removed it or asked anyone to do so,’ he said.

‘Anyone who knows anything about me knows that I do not care what people say about me - let alone care about what it might say about me on Wikipedia.’

Other disappearances include a passage detailing how Chris Kelly had emailed his fellow MPs to ask them to give his sister a job. Mr Kelly was unavailable for comment.

Jon Davies, the chief executive of Wikimedia UK, the UK chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia and its sister websites, stressed that the site was keen to see more users participating on the site. ‘We would welcome any MPs who want to become editors,’ he said.

Many parliamentarians’ contributions to the site have been unwelcome, and users have been admonished dozens of times for vandalising the website.

In July 2009, one administrator posted: ‘This is the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits. The next time you disrupt Wikipedia, as you did to Eric Clapton, you will be blocked from editing.’

This investigation was carried out by the The Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
