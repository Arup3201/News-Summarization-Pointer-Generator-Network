For years the world has watched her cuddle a chimpanzee, swing on an elephant's trunk and gently stroke camels through a series of stunning photos by her mother.

And although she is now aged 15 and has developed other interests, Amelia Forman, from New Jersey, insists she has no plans to stop posing with animals.

'There’s nothing stopping us,’ the 10th grader told the Daily Telegraph.

‘I’m just going to keep playing it out till the end.’

Amelia Forman  has been posing for her photographer mom, Robin Schwartz, for 12 years

Now 15, her mother, award-winning photographer, Robin Schwartz, who’s worked for the likes of National Geographic and has prints in the MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has 12 years worth of photos of her daughter cozying up to exotic creatures

As she has grown older Amelia's affinity with animals has not dampened - as seen here as she poses with an elephant over the years 

The project officially took flight in 2004, spawned by a sudden family tragedy. 

'My mother and mother-in-law died quite close to each other and it knocked me for six,' said Schwartz.

'After that though, I realised that it was so important to spend time with my daughter.

'So we came to the understanding that if she was to come with me on my photographic work our deal would be that the only times I would take pictures of her would be when she was with animals.

'She loves them, she is so natural with them.

'She is a shy girl, but can have more confidence with a giraffe, or a chimpanzee than a fully grown man or woman could have with another person. 

'We spend time most summers attending fairs and meeting contacts in the animal community, where Amelia can come close to elephants like Shiba, who simply picked her up with her trunk.

Her adventures began at the age of three when her photographer mother Robin took her along with her as she went to work at private homes and game parks

Now 15, Amelia has started putting her own print on the photos, such as styling the costumes

The teen says she feels more comfortable around animals than she does people

'That was a magical moment for me and Amelia. It really was like Amelia was talking to Shiba, just like you would with a person. It was beautiful.'

While their adventures has already produced one book, Amelia's World, The Aperture Foundation is trying to raise funds on Kickstarter for another that encompasses the whole journey, to be called Amelia and the Animals.

'Since I was only three, it seemed sort of normal just to know monkeys and a lot of different animals,' Amelia says in the Kickstarter video, 'until I got older and I realized that wasn’t something that most kids had the opportunity to do.' 

Schwartz told the Telegraph that she thinks her daughter has grown alongside the portraits. 

The unusual photographs have been compiled into a book called Amelia and the Animals

Amelia is totally at ease with the animals and has developed a deep affinity with them

‘I think Amelia is very conscious of what she’s doing,’ she says. ‘In 2010 I felt her interest was waning so I asked her what she wanted, and she said more primates.

'So I networked to find her primates.’

But although she loves animals she has no plans to follow her mother's career.

‘I want to go into science,’ she told the newspaper

‘But I don’t think the distinction between science and art is that clear cut. 

In maths our last project was constructions. We went to church and chose stained-glass windows to reconstruct. Our final project was drawings we had to colour and paint, but we had to figure out the proportions without using a ruler. 

'That’s just one example of how connected art is with maths.’
