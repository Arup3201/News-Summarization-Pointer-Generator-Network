England are not suddenly favourites to regain the Ashes next summer. They are not favourites to beat Pakistan in the UAE soon after that, nor to win in South Africa in 2015-16. 

But, after going 1-0 down to India at Lord’s, they won the next three Tests as if they were playing the Bangladesh 2nd XI. For the time being they can take real pleasure in the transformation.

Not all the problems have suddenly been solved. Alastair Cook’s three half-centuries in four innings needed generous helpings of luck. Sam Robson looks constipated. We don’t yet know how Chris Woakes will fare if the ball doesn’t swing. And Moeen Ali could do with some runs.

But England deserve a slap on the back, not least for making India look that awful. The selectors stuck with Woakes and Chris Jordan, who finished the series with 10 wickets at 22, and Paul Downton never considered sacking Cook.

At two points this summer, Downton may have wavered – for Cook himself certainly did, dissuaded from resignation by his wife, Alice. The first nadir was on the fourth evening at Headingley, after England had blown a near-impregnable position against Sri Lanka. The second was the Lord’s defeat by India.

Both results were freakish in their own way. England may never again lose a home Test to Sri Lanka after leading by over 100 on first innings. And they may never again be outbowled by Indian seamers on a greentop. But the defeats said plenty about the post-Ashes state of mind, which veered between denial and despondency.

That Downton stuck with Cook may tell us something about his own stubbornness – a quality the two men evidently share. Both will be quietly thanking their genetic make-up now. And yet both will know how much they owe to their new-ball pairing.

At Southampton, Old Trafford and The Oval, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad shared 28 wickets at 13 apiece while conceding 2.2 an over.

Both men were at their best: Anderson was snakingly word-perfect, darting it this way and that, with no discernible change of grip; Broad was remorselessly malevolent, despite only one good knee and a broken nose. They would have troubled better sides than India.

Even so, the Anderson-Broad axis gives India an easy get-out clause: they can say they were beaten by English seamers in English conditions. Inconveniently, Moeen claimed 19 wickets at 23. Since Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin claimed 12 between them at 43, English spin has trumped Indian spin for the second Test series in a row – and this time without Graeme Swann or Monty Panesar.

As much as anything, it was India’s laziness against Moeen that summed up their approach. Every time they tried to break free of England’s half-Nelson, the sense of strangulation grew. By the end, we were just hearing the same old tropes from MS Dhoni.

After England won in India in 2012-13, Dhoni was asked if the result represented a low point. No, he said: that was the 2007 World Cup, a comment that seemed indicative of India’s priorities. Yet when the question was put to him again on Sunday, he instead cited as his personal nadir India’s 4-0 defeat in England in 2011. But then, in Test cricket, he is collecting plenty of options.

There were moments in this series when Dhoni fought hard with the bat, attempting to overcome a homespun technique and the deficiencies of his team-mates. But it remains a mystery, for which opponents are thankful, that he is still India’s Test captain.

His decision to go on the defensive as early as the second session at Southampton felt like a surrender, as if he had forgotten the series consisted of five Tests, not three. His bowling changes were frequently weird. And he spoke enigmatically of the importance of ‘processes’, while waving a regal hand in the direction of mere ‘results’.

On Sunday evening, after acknowledging the suggestion that India’s players might benefit from a stint in county cricket, he was asked whether Virat Kohli would ever consider sacrificing the IPL for a spell with a shire. His answer came with a familiar passive-aggressive grin: ‘You’ll have to ask BCCI. Don’t be too jealous of IPL.’

It was a revealing response, for the question had conveyed no jealousy. Dhoni is said to earn $30million a year. Perhaps that’s what he had in mind.

Alas, no amount of money could buy runs for Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli, and here we can finish with one final contrast. While those two – perhaps the most feted pair of young batsmen in the world game – scraped together one half-century in 20 innings, the eminently less glamorous couple of Gary Ballance and Joe Root managed four hundreds and five fifties from 14 innings.

It doesn’t matter how much you earn or how sexy your cover-drive looks or even how much you scream in the face of vanquished batsmen. It matters how much you’re prepared to scrap. England lost 5-0 not so long ago. But at least English cricket, finally, was honest with itself.

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

The wonder of Ravi

One of the most intriguing aspects of India’s meltdown were the logical contortions Ravi Shastri would find himself in each night on Sky’s Verdict show. Shastri has based his post-cricket career on clinging on to the BCCI’s greasy pole. It allows him many privileges but demands strict loyalty.

Asked by Charles Colvile on Sunday whether MS Dhoni would have to consider his position, Shastri replied that this would only occur if India were badly beaten by England at home. What he can only have meant was ‘badly beaten by England at home twice’ – unless he feels a 10-wicket defeat at Mumbai followed by a seven-wicket loss at Kolkata don’t quite fit the bill. Still, greasy poles can be tricky beggars...

Hales for Test cricket

Eoin Morgan believes Alex Hales ‘stakes a huge claim to be selected in all three formats’. Even though Morgan’s point comes with the caveat that he probably has the same view of his own batting, he is right. England have five Tests left before their next tilt at the Ashes – three in the Caribbean, two at home against New Zealand. And they should consider the course of action the Australians would least like them to take.

Whirlwind: Alex Hales could be England's match-winner at the top of the order in Test cricket

Sam Robson is a determined player with serious limitations. It’s hard to see him winning you a Test match. But Hales, who is finally on the brink of his one-day international debut, has the potential to be England’s answer to David Warner – a hit-and-miss top-order whirlwind who can win you a game if he bats two sessions.

England have taken the plunge with Jos Buttler, and nobody died. They can do the same with Hales.

Elegant and effortless

Farewell, then, Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman of aching elegance whose 11,814 Test runs at a fraction under 50 would have qualified him for even more superlatives had he played for one of the sport’s superpowers. 

As it was, there could sometimes be a hint of condescension when it came to his place in the pantheon – bracketed below Muttiah Muralitharan, or alongside Kumar Sangakkara, when in fact he deserved a place all of his own.

Jayawardene’s reputation as a gentleman was exaggerated. Though less obviously prickly than Arjuna Ranatunga, he was rarely less than flinty, and in a press conference at Leeds in June needed no invitation to dance on England’s grave. But it was his batting we’ll remember: effortless, second-gear, 30-on-the-board-before-you’ve-blinked. And, yes, an all-time great.

The women trip up

Earlier this year at the England team dinner in the Lord’s Long Room, it was as if the 5-0 Ashes disaster had never happened. The focus, instead, was on the women, who had retained their urn thanks mainly to a memorable Test win at Perth. Now they have just lost a home Test to India. Witnesses say it did not make for encouraging viewing. The BCCI have virtually ignored women’s cricket, while the ECB have invested plenty. This was as bad as it gets.
