Looking at the shocking pictures, it is little wonder doctors described her recovery as remarkable and miraculous.

With deep stitches zigzagging across her head where parts of her skull were removed and dents and bruises around her face, Gabrielle Giffords is a very lucky woman.

Shot in the head on January 8 by a crazed gunman in Tucson, Arizona, it was thought that she may be in a coma for months and was very lucky she did not die.

Smiling: Looking at the pictures of Gabby in hospital and how she looks now, it is little wonder the doctors said she has made a remarkable recovery

In a book written by her astronaut husband Mark Kelly, he recalls his wife's journey to recovery and revealed there is still hope for them to have a child.

Recalling the moment he first saw Gabby in hospital after the shooting, which killed six and injured 19, Mark said: 'Nothing fully prepares you for seeing someone you love in such a critical state.

'I took it all in and then told her how much I loved her. I knew she couldn't hear me but I had to say it.'

In extracts from the book published in People magazine he wrote that he promised her she would get through it and took her hand, noticing that there was caked blood under each of her fingernails.

'I tried not to cry,' he said. 'As I stood there at her bedside , a slight bloody tear fell from her left eye. I reached over and, very tenderly, wiped it away.'

The former astronaut, who was shot into space for the fourth and final time this year, also revealed that he and Gabrielle had been planning on having a child before she was shot, though they have not ruled out the possibility.

With two frozen embryos still in storage at the Walter Reed Naval Medical Centre, he said: 'It was still possible for us to have a child together, though 
given Gabby's injuries, we'd probably need to go through a surrogate.'

When asked about her bucket list recently by a nurse, Gabby could have said a baby or to return to Congress. But, knowing she had to put such dreams aside, she simply answered: 'Get better.'

Recalling the lowest moment of her recovery, Mark writes that it was in February, when she was sitting in her wheelchair hyperventilating and panicking.

He said: 'She motioned with her left hand, waving it by her mouth. It didn't take me long to figure out what was wrong.

'She had tried to speak but she couldn't and just figured out she was trapped. Trapped inside of herself. Her eyes were as wide open as I'd ever seen them and the look on her face was of absolute fear.'

An interview with the couple with Diane Sawyer will be aired on ABC on November 14.

Speaking about spending time with Gabrielle and Mark to People magazine, she said: 'She is remarkable. With every move she make, she reminds all of us that the time to give up is never. She is looking at a lot of therapy but she's very disciplined about it.

'And she really has her husband by her side. He told me, "She likes goals, so I'm setting some goals for her". He's the captain of her team.

'Of all the people I've interviewed, she's right there at the top.'

Though the book is written by Mark Kelly, Gabrielle delivers the last chapter â€“ a single page of short sentences and phrases entitled 'Gabby's Voice' in which she says her goal is to get back to Congress.

'I will get stronger. I will return,' she vows.

The 40-year-old stunned colleagues by appearing on the U.S. House floor in Washington on August 1 to vote for the debt ceiling deal, but she has focused most of her time on her recovery at TIRR Memorial Hermann, a rehabilitation center in Houston.

In the book, her husband recalls trying to tell his wife several times what had happened that January 8 morning.

But she didn't fully understand until March 12.

Mark asked his wife if she remembered being shot, and she replied that she did.

When he asked what she remembered about it, she said three words: 'Shot. Shocked. Scary.'

Later that same day, he was reading to her from a New York Times article about her recovery and skipped over a paragraph that said six others were killed.

Following along, Gabrielle knew he left something out and pushed him to tell her what it was.

When she learned of the deaths, Mark writes that she was overcome with emotion and had trouble getting through therapy.

As she progressed, Mark said his wife learned to talk again, reciting the U.S. Constitution and Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech.

The book reveals that because of her injuries, Gabrielle has lost 50 per cent of her vision in both eyes.
