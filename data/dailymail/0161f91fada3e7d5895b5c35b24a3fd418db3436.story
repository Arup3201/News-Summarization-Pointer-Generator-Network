The episode isn't among Spider-Man's biggest hits: the superhero versus the snow-wielding mom.

One of the costumed characters who roam Times Square went on trial today in New York. Philip Williams is accused of hitting a passer-by who didn't tip him for posing for a photo with her children on February 10, 2013.

Williams' lawyer Rachel Black argued that even though Williams may have been 'obnoxious' towards the mother by calling her a 'piece of crap' for not tipping him, that he acted in 'self defense.'

Victoria Goreaciuc says Williams cursed at her and later punched her in the temple.

She acknowledges confronting him and flinging a handful of snow at him. Williams says he reacted in self-defense after a cold, hard chunk hit his head.

The defense had questioned whether Williams was actually the costumed figure who allegedly insulted Goreaciuc. But he later acknowledged in testimony that he was.

'Saying you’re a piece crap is a really obnoxious thing to do and unfortunately in New York we have to deal with stuff like that. It’s actually not a crime to be a jerk, unfortunately or fortunately,' said Black in a statement in court today.

The New York Daily News reports that Black called Goreaciuc 'the initial aggressor in a confrontation with a confused and bewildered Mr. Williams, who had been struck in the back of a head with not a snowball but an ice block.'

'He turned and acted in self-defense because he reasonably believed that Ms. Goreaciuc was going to use physical force against him because she had just used physical force against him,' Black added.

Goreaciuc’s husband allegedly also targeted Williams by stealing his backpack during the fight.

A character dressed as Batman then apparently stepped in to ask Goreaciuc’s husband to return the knapsack.

Goreaciuc’s 5-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son whose birthday they were celebrating were nearby.

Prosecutors argue that even though Goreaciuc threw snow at Williams, a punch in the head was not an appropriate response.

'Admittedly this is not Ms. Goreaciuc’s proudest moment … but [WILLIAMS’]response was to punch Ms. Goreaciuc’s on the side of her face,' said Assistant District Attorney Andrew Stengel.

Williams is charged with attempted assault and harassment and faces up to 90 days if he is convicted.

This case is among several criminal cases in recent years against Times Square's costumed characters.
