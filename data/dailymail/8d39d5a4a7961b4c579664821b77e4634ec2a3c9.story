Google Maps relies on 'landmark' information the search giant has 'bought in' from mapping companies such as TeleAtlas.

But a new version of Google's Map Maker lets anyone add landmarks to Google Maps - letting any user add on points of interest, draw on more detailed maps, and even review and delete other people's edits.

One of the uses Google showed off for the new version of Map Maker was drawing a 'boundary' round a university - information currently lacking from Google Maps

Google Map Maker is accessible via any web browser, and usable by anyone with a Google account.

Google suggests uses such as adding whether a street is one-way - crucial to the sat-nav service it offers on Android phones - and adding details such as lakes to parks, which currently appear as a blank green space.

'Update the actual map as seen by millions of users on Google Maps,' the site promises.

You can add places - such as new shops - edit other people's additions, and review other people's edits. 

Google also approve every edit before it goes live on Google Maps, so towns aren't going to be 'digitally vandalised' by a deluge of unnecessary information.

Google's new version of Map Maker will allow any users to add their own landmarks - or even edit other users' landmarks on the site. Google will approve landmarks before they 'go live', though

The underlying information in Google Maps will still also be provided by TeleAtlas, so major landmarks won't be affected.

Google says its business relationship with TeleAtlas 'will continue' - although some tech insiders suspect that this move is a prelude to Google building its own 'crowd-sourced' database of information.

In response to a question about whether Google would continue to rely on TeleAtlas, a spokesperson said, 'Tele Atlas is a valued partner to Google and they continue to provide us with data for dozens of countries.'

Kaushik Sridharan, one of Google's software engineers on their Maps, said in a blog post, 'Today, we’re revealing a new version of Google Map Maker to help users map the places they know best and make their hometowns sparkle on Google Maps.'

Google's new version of Map Maker will allow users to 'enrich' the map with their own edits - although Google insists that its business relationship with TeleAtlas, who provide the underlying data in the maps, will not change

'With Map Maker, you can easily help ensure that the changing world around you is accurately reflected on the map. Add your favorite gift shop, the nearest tree farm, or even the golf course where you once got that hole in one.'

'It’s also easier to mark the best route to Grandma’s house and draw better buildings with courtyards and crisper corners. The options are endless when it comes to mapping the places you know and love.'

'Once approved, your contributions will appear on Google Maps, Google Earth and Google Maps for mobile for all the world to see.'

Google pointed to an American high-school student, Tommy Bruce, who has added dozens of American cycle trails to the sites, and said, 'Why not make your New Year’s resolution to improve the map for millions of people?'
