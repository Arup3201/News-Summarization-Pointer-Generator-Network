Another day, another selfie craze, though we certainly hope this one won't stick around for long.

'Selloptape selfies' are popping up all over Facebook, where thousands of people have been wrapping clear tape around their face to make themselves look like grotesque ogres.

They then upload their bizarre picture to Facebook and nominate a friend to take part in the challenge as well.

It was dreamed up by Lizzie Durley, 21, who is studying international event management at Brighton University.

'I got the idea from Jim Carrey's office scene in Yes Man,' she says.

'I was having a bad day and remembered that scene from the film which really tickled me.

'I
 figured people were getting bored of the whole 'selfie' craze - I know I
 was.

'So I just applied the concepts of the selfie to this idea and it 
resulted in Sellotape selfies!'

Miss Durley presented the idea to her friends who shared it online.

Before she knew it, it was all over the internet.

'It grew so quickly,' she says.

'The concept is applicable to 
literally anyone, everyone can join in, there's no risk of offence, and 
people just love to have a giggle.

'So it blew up on Facebook.'

Miss Durley says her 'goal' was 3,000 followers on the Facebook page.
