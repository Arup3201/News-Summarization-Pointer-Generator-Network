A 12-year-old boy described today how he watched his twin brother slowly die of dehydration, but was too scared of his step-mother to give him water.

Joseph James said he knew something was wrong with his fraternal twin brother Johnathan James in August 2011, but he was terrified of doing anything.

Joseph's step-mother Tina Alberson and his father Michael James, of both Dallas, Texas, face life in prison over charges that they caused 10-year-old Jonathan's death by depriving him of water.

Jonathan was being punished for stealing his step brother's guitar strings, sneaking water and food when he wasn't supposed to have it and wetting the bed, prosecutors say.

'I did have concerns but, like I said before, I was scared to do anything,' Joseph told the jury on Thursday, according to the Dallas Morning News.

It was also revealed that Alberson became good friends with another woman accused of horrific child abuse - Elizabeth Escalona, the 23-year-old mother who glued her two-year-old daughter's hands to a wall and then beat her to death. 

The pair reportedly began a relationship when they were in jail together.

A Morning News reported tweeted that during Escalona's sentencing hearing, prosecutors played a recording of a jailhouse phone call between the two.

On Wednesday, prosecutors showed a videotaped interview Alberson gave to Dallas police in which she admitted that she had caused the boy's death - though only after detectives showed her an autopsy report that showed he had no urine in his bladder when he died.

'I obviously did this. I didn't mean to do this,' she said, her voice cracking. 

Also on Wednesday, Jonathan's father, who is wheelchair-bound and legally blind, testified against his wife.

Life in prison: Both Tin Alberson, the boy's stepmother, and Michael James, his biological father, face 99 years behind bars if they are convicted

Punishment: Jonathan was forced to stand in the kitchen on the taped X, facing the taped X on the open window, Joseph testified. This punishment was carried out even on sweltering days where the temperature reached 100

Michael James claimed he had no idea that Alberson was withhold water from his son and had no idea that he was so thirsty.

He described the moment Alberson told him Jonathan was dying.

'She comes back and looks at me and rolls her eyes and tilts her head back and says, 'He just had his eyes roll back into his head. Call 911,"' he testified. 

Joseph James testified that he watched his brother Jonathan die. He in the room when his brother went into shock and his organs failed from dehydration. He was also at the hospital as his brother was declared dead.

'I started panicking because he didn’t have a heartbeat, he didn’t have a pulse and I was scared,' little Joseph testified.
