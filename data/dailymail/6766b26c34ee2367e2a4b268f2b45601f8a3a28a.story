Three decades after it started gaining attention in British curry houses, the great Birmingham Balti has been put forward for official recognition.

If the EU grants the dish Protected Food Name status, it would mean anyone in the world cooking the distinctive curry must refer to it as the Birmingham Balti.

It would then join French Champagne, Italian Parmesan cheese and British Stilton, which already have the legal protection.

The Birmingham Balti has been put forward for EU Protected Food Name status, three years after it started growing in popularity in British curry houses

The Balti was developed by cooks from northern Pakistan when they came to Britain in the 1970s and 1980s.

Altering ancestral recipes to incorporate British ingredients and the British palate, they came up with a dish cooked in a steel pan over a high flame.

Using meat cooked off the bone, the cooks started using vegetable oil instead of the ghee they had used in Pakistan.

They also used dried spices rather than fresh.

The EU application, which has been backed by Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss, says that anyone who uses a similar cooking process has to use the official name ‘Birmingham Balti’ - even if it is being cooked in India or Pakistan.

Indian TV cook Madhur Jaffrey dismissed baltis as 'a craze' with 'no authentic origin' and predicted 'it will slowly die' in this country

Other British foods to have already achieved the status include the Cornish pasty, Jersey royal potato and Melton Mowbray pork pie.

Miss Truss said: ‘Curry is a great part of our food heritage, along with fish and chips and pork pies.

‘Let’s hope the popular Birmingham Balti recipe follows in the footsteps of our other iconic foods like the Cornish pasty and Fenland celery. It would be a wonderful boost for this great city’s world famous Balti Triangle.

‘Legally protecting food names creates new jobs and attracts more tourists to the area. We hope other producers are encouraged to do the same and unlock the full potential that their original recipes can bring.’

Andy Munro, adviser to the Birmingham Balti Restaurant Association said: ‘We look forward to the day when it joins the hallowed ranks of Stilton Cheese and Arbroath Smokies as a protected food.’

Last week, Indian TV cook Madhur Jaffrey dismissed baltis as 'a craze' with 'no authentic origin' and predicted 'it will slowly die' in this country.

Jaffrey, who was born in Delhi and became a household name with her BBC cookery shows in the 1980s, said Indian food in Britain was slowly getting better.

And the 81-year-old said the Balti, which had 'origins in no place we would want to visit', would slowly die out as people moved on to other Indian dishes.
