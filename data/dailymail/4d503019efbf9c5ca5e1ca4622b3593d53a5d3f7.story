An international ballet dancer cheated taxpayers out of benefits worth almost £28,000 as she toured the world in star-studded performances.

Sirena Khalatian, 54, is a respected dancer and choreographer who has worked for the some of the biggest names on the global stage.

She was paid thousands of pounds while working for the English National Opera, the Royal Opera House and productions at Glyndebourne, in East Sussex.

Cheat: The 54-year-old was paid thousands of pounds over eight years while working for the English National Opera, the Royal Opera House and productions at Glyndebourne, in East Sussex

But she failed to tell the authorities about her soaring career in the spotlight and continued to pocket housing and council tax benefits.

After being confronted by officials the Iranian-born dancer admitted dishonestly obtaining at least £27,864 from her local council over eight years.

A judge said there was no doubt the 'intelligent' artist knew what she was doing was wrong and that she had failed in her duty as an 'honourable citizen'.

But despite the attack she was allowed to walk free from court with an order to complete just 120 hours of community service.

One campaigning group said the Government must do more to ensure that the benefits system helps those who need it most, not greedy cheats.

Khalatian is a respected classical dancer who travelled to China last month where she is choreographing a performance of the French opera Carmen.

According to an online biography, she has also worked on productions in London, Paris, Monte Carlo, the U.S. and South America.

But Inner London Crown Court was told how she repeatedly failed to inform Southwark Council of her growing earnings as her career took off.

Prosecutor Adam Payter said that in the eight years up until January 2011 she received substantial overpayments while working in three different roles.

When interviewed she claimed they offences were simply a 'misunderstanding' but eventually pleaded guilty when the case went to court.

Among the prestigious venues Khalatian has worked is the Royal Opera House, in Covent Garden, London

Sentencing her to unpaid work for the community, Judge Usha Karu said she 'could not accept' that Khalatian did not realise her actions were dishonest.

'When people claim money they are not entitled to from a pool that is not inexhaustible it deprives those who are genuinely deserving,' she said.

'Particularly during the recent difficult economic climate, there must be others more deserving, honest and truly in need who may not have received the money they should have.'

Jennifer Holdsworth said Khalatian, who cares for her elderly mother in Hammersmith, west London, is 'deeply ashamed' of her actions.

'Unfortunately Miss Khalatian is a dancer and actor and her work is sporadic. She suffered quite a bad injury which has resulted in her being unable to work,' she said.

'She will leave her crutch at the side of the stage and take Ibuprofen and go on to dance. She could easily have signed off working.

'But this is her passion and something she has done since she was four-years-old. She is 54 and has worked her way up and is now a choreographer, something she is extremely proud of.

'She is not getting any younger and her work as a dancer requires physical strength and the years are ticking by.'

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayer's Alliance, said: 'This sort of abuse damages the public's trust in the benefits system as a whole.

'The benefits system should help those who need it most, not be used as an extra income for globe-trotting dancers.

'This Government has made welcome strides in addressing fraud in the system, but needs to do much more to ensure that only those who need it receive taxpayers' money.'

Khalatian, of south-east London, admitted six counts of dishonestly failing to notify the authorities of a change in her personal circumstances. She paid £150 in costs.
