Stabbing: Leonardo Henry, 25, broke into his ex-girlfriend's home and stabbed her repeatedly

An 11-year-old Oklahoma girl shot her mother's abusive ex-boyfriend after he broke into their home and began stabbing her mother Tuesday morning.

Eleven-year-old Jayda Milsap shot Leonardo Henry, 25, with a handgun twice after he broke into her Oklahoma City home and began stabbing her mother in the eye, neck and chest, KFOR reports. 

Just a week before the incident, Milsap's mother, Brandy Moreno, filed a restraining order against Henry  claiming he 'had been molesting (several kids) in the middle of the night for several years,' KFOR reports.

She later told authorities she was afraid that Henry would hurt her or the children because she reported him to the police. 

The Oklahoman reports that a neighbor said Moreno taught Milsap how to use the handgun one week before the incident 'so she could protect herself.'

The lessons came in handy.

Henry  broke through the back door of the home at 4am leaving a trail of broken glass. Moreno's two children and Henry's three children were in the home at the time of the attack, New York Daily News reports.

After being shot by Milsap, Henry reportedly fled and was found down the street from the home, authorities say. He was taken to the hospital but police say he will soon be booked at the Oklahoma City Jail.

The Oklahoman reports that both Moreno and Henry were taken to the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in serious condition.

Sister: Henry's sister Emma Spence said that, though she hates to admit it, Henry may be guilty of the alleged sexual abuse

Hospital officials reportedly refused to report on the current condition of the two but KFOR reports that both the victim and Henry are expected to survive their injuries. 

Milsap's neighbors  hail her as a hero, according to KFOR. Even Henry's sister Emma Spence said that she salutes the 11-year-old and that her brother may be guilty of the sexual abuse, though she hates to admit it.

 'I salute her,' Spence told KFOR. 'It was awesome that she did that for her mom...I'm 21 and I don't even know how to use a gun.' 

Milsap's neighbor, Carolyn Marsee said, in a KFOR interview, that she hopes a judge puts Henry away for a long time.

'I could care less if he dies, because what he did was very wrong,' Marsee said. 

Authorities say that, as of now, the shooting appears to have been justified and the children have been taken into protective custody with the state Department of Human Services.
