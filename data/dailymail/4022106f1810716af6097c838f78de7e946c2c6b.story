A broker at a trendy New York real estate firm has agreed to accept $15,000 in damages after she was accused by her employer of uploading naked pictures to the company's servers.

Stephanie Gribbin was accused of posting racy photographs of herself to the 
company's accounts and stealing valuable Brooklyn real estate listings.

Gribbin was hired as an agent at Nooklyn in August 2012, the Brooklyn federal court heard.

The firm, which is owned by entrepreneur Harley Courts, also claimed Gribbin contacted landlords and clients she had known through the company and tried to convince them to work with her new firm, Stephanie Rose Consulting.

The owners filed a $300,000 lawsuit against Gribben last year, according to Brooklyn federal court papers.

But Gribbin, from Long Island, said Nooklyn made up the claims after she complained that the company tried to get rid of her because she was pregnant.

The complaint also accused her of vengefully deleting company files, the New York Post reported.

The company's attorneys said that Gribbin's actions hurt the fledgling business that caters to Greenpoint and Williamsburg hipsters and demanded damages.

Gribbin, who represented herself because she said she couldn't afford a lawyer, agreed to accept $15,000 in damages to the firm and drop her complaint against them.

Gribbin declined to comment on the settlement.
