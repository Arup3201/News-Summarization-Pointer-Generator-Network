Held without bond: Anthony Joseph Garcia has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder in Nebraska

A doctor accused of killing four people in revenge for being fired 12 years ago from a university residency program was today ordered to be held in prison without bond.

Dr Anthony J. Garcia, 40, dressed in a yellow jumpsuit and heavily shackled, made his first appearance in Douglas County Court in Omaha, Nebraska on Tuesday morning.

Garcia has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Dr Roger Brumback and his wife Mary at their Omaha home in May this year. He is also believed to be responsible for the murders of 11-year-old Thomas Hunter and his family's housekeeper Shirlee Sherman back in 2008 in Omaha.

Police say the killings were acts of revenge against Brumback and another Creighton University doctor who fired him from a pathology residency in 2001 for unprofessional conduct.

Garcia was arrested last week in southern Illinois and extradited late on Thursday to Omaha.

An affidavit unsealed last week showed receipts, eyewitness accounts, cell phone records and evidence at the Brumbacks' home connected Garcia to Omaha at the times of the killings.

Garcia's attorneys argued before Judge Lawrence Barrett on Tuesday that the evidence in the affidavit was 'circumstantial and thinly veiled'.

Garcia will be held in the Douglas County Department of Corrections pending a preliminary hearing set for August 14.

The Brumbacks, both 65, were found dead 
on May 14. Each had stab wounds to the side of their necks and Dr 
Brumback also was shot, according to the affidavit.

Police said the stab
wounds were similar to ones found in the 2008 murders.

Garcia is also accused of stabbing to death Thomas Hunter (left) and Shirlee Sherman (right) in 2008. Hunter is the 11-year-old son of Creighton professor William Hunter and Sherman was the Hunter family's housekeeper

Garcia was fired in 2001 by Dr Brumback and Dr William Hunter. The murdered 11-year-old was Hunter's son, but police have said they do not believe that the boy or the housekeeper were the intended targets.

According to the affidavit and records, Garcia had applied for an Indiana medical license in 2008 and in 2012. Indiana denied his requests.

Records released by the Indiana medical board from those applications show he failed to complete residencies in New York, Illinois and Louisiana in addition to Nebraska.

He was suspended from a New York residency for yelling at a radiology technician, then withdrew from the program in 1999. He also withdrew from an Illinois residency, citing migraine headaches.

Garcia's application for a Louisiana medical license was rejected in February 2008, two weeks before Hunter and Sherman were killed, in part because he had not completed the other residency programs.
