Steven Smith is to captain Australia in the absence of Michael Clarke after being promoted to the vice-captaincy by Cricket Australia.

Smith will lead the side for the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank Test Series against India after Clarke was ruled out with a hamstring injury suffered in the opening Test in Adelaide earlier this week, and his promotion could yet prove to be permanent, with Clarke himself suggesting that this latest in a long list of injury problems leaves his future in the game uncertain.

The 25-year-old Smith got the nod ahead of the current vice-captain Brad Haddin, who will serve as his deputy when the second Test begins in Brisbane on Wednesday, and the decision to go with the younger man may reveal the extent of concern over the 33-year-old Clarke's future.

National selector Rod Marsh said in a Cricket Australia release: 'These are difficult circumstances given Michael's injury and the fact that we don't know how long he will be out of the game.

'What we do know is that it won't be an overnight fix so after a lot of thought we have taken the opportunity to appoint an emerging young leader as captain until such time as Michael regains fitness and returns to the side.

'We congratulate Steve on the wonderful honour of leading his country. On Wednesday he will become Australia's 45th Test captain and at the age of 25 will become one of our youngest leaders. He is an exceptional young man who is highly regarded by the National Selection Panel not only for his fine performances with the bat but also his maturity and clear leadership potential.'

The 25-year-old all-rounder has been rewarded for his maturity and is seen as a long-term captain

Clarke's latest injury comes after he made a century in Adelaide, and could keep him out for a while

At 37, Haddin's age counted against him with Cricket Australia keen to take a long view.

'Brad Haddin has done an exceptional job as vice-captain since assuming the role last year and will provide strong support to Steve just as he has done for Michael,' Marsh added.

'There was a strong argument for Brad to assume the captaincy until Michael returns, but given we don't know how long that will be, we felt the time was right to take a longer-term view and give a young player this chance.'

Smith, who has captaincy experience with New South Wales and the Sydney Sixers, has emerged as a leading batsman in 23 Test appearances for Australia, having initially made the grade as a leg-spinner who could contribute with the bat.

He had unbeaten innings of 162 and 52 in the 48-run victory over India, lifting his Test average to 46.03.
