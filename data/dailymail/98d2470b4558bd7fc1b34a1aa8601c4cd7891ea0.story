One of the world’s richest men is comparing the Federal Reserve to a hedge fund, and heaping praise on a policy seen as misguided by some.

Warren Buffet, 82, made the comparison Thursday during an interview at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C., while discussing the central bank’s quantitative easing policy – but another billionaire criticized the program, calling it a reverse-redistribution of wealth.

Quantitative easing saw the US government purchasing over $1.3trillion in securities at a clip of as much as $85billion per month.  The policy was enacted at the height of the recession to save the financial markets from total collapse.

Despite more than tripling the Fed’s balance sheet to over $3.6trillion, the US monetary authority has received praise for its market intervention.

‘The Fed is the greatest hedge fund in history,’ said Mr Buffet.

The ‘Oracle of Omaha’ made the comparison only one day after the Fed made public plans to push back the long wind-down of the program, said the Telegraph.

The policy has stabilized financial markets to the point they are reaching highs never before seen, even setting closing records several times in recent months.

The billionaire also said he would reappoint current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to a second term, if it were up to him, the Telegraph reported.

‘Since the panic of five years ago, he's done a terrific job,’ Buffet said, adding when asked if he would reappoint the former Princeton University professor ‘that’s what I would do.’

Mr Buffet, head of Berkshire Hathaway, did warn that the government’s eventual exit from the securities business may not be as easy as its entry.

‘We are in an experiment which hasn't really been tried before,’ he said, according to the Telegraph, ‘buying securities is usually easier than selling securities.’

The Fed’s quantitative easing purchases have been a combination of Federal Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

Not so fast: Fellow billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Capital, called quantitative easing 'the biggest redistribution of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the rich ever'

The program was widely expected to end no later than early summer, causing investor jitters earlier this year. As the program has dragged on, the market has continued to rise – a development one billionaire bragged about Thursday morning on CNBC.

‘This is fantastic for every rich person,’ said hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller. ‘This is the biggest redistribution of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the rich ever.’

Mr Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Capital, blasted the program, saying the only people benefitting from it are the rich.

‘I mean, maybe this trickle-down monetary policy that gives money to billionaires and hopefully we go spend it is going to work,’ he said during the network’s Squawk Box program, ‘but it hasn't worked for five years.’
