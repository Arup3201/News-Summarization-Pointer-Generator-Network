Three women tortured a man by pressing burning hair tongs and a cigarette lighter on to his genitals when they found he had dated three people at once, a court has heard.

The trio also taunted the victim with a pizza cutter in what was described as like a scene from Reservoir Dogs.

Lorraine Earles, 47, Natalie Lilley, 19, Leah White, 22, along with male defendant Brendan Teale, 27, had plotted revenge on the victim for allegedly seeing several women at a time and lured him to a flat in Scarborough before strapping him to a chair.

The three women and one man then carried out a prolonged attack on the victim, who was also forced to drink liquid wash before having the hot curling tongs pressed to his genitals.

York Crown Court heard one of his tormentors also burnt him with a cigarette lighter as the others laughed and giggled.

During the torture he also had a pizza cutter pressed to his cheek and was punched, kicked and slapped repeatedly.

The court heard Earles bit the man's ear, pushed his head down to his knees and used a cigarette lighter to burn the back of his neck, before threatening to suffocate him as she put a scarf around his mouth.

She then ordered White to burn his genitals with hair curling tongs before pulling the chair back, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor.

The frightening escalation of the assault prompted White and Lilley to alert Teale, who was reputedly the ringleader of the assault and took part in the beating, but had retired to a bedroom before Earles upped the ante in a scene reminiscent of the bloody Quentin Tarantino film.

Teale untied the victim and picked him up off the floor, then went back to the bedroom and fell asleep, while Earles nodded off on a sofa. 

White then took the flat door keys out of his pocket and released the victim, whose Blackberry phone had been stolen and later pawned by Teale.

The four torture suspects were later arrested after the victim's step-mother called police.

York Crown Court heard each blamed one another for the sickening attack but Teale and Earles were found to be the main protagonists.

The four suspects were originally charged with falsely imprisoning the man on November 10, 2013, but this was eventually dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service and they each pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

They appeared for sentence on Friday, when the court heard that Teale - who has previous convictions for assault and battery - had been smoking cannabis on the day in question.

After being bailed by police, he went on to commit a burglary and was also charged with handling stolen goods taken in a separate raid.

White, who had once been in a relationship with the victim, and Lilley, a mother-of-one on benefits, both had clean records up until the attack.

Barrister Andrew Temple, for Teale, said the defendants had lured the man to the flat to teach him a lesson for allegedly seeing several women at the same time, but he claimed that Earles had been the 'main player' in the torture scene.

Laura Addy, for Earles, said her client had severe mental health issues and was under Teale's spell.

York Crown Court, pictured, heard how as the victim's burnt him with a cigarette lighter the others laughed and giggled.

White's defence barrister Glen Parsons said she had acted 'wholly out of character' under orders from others.'

'Her role was to use the (curling) tongs but she insisted they weren't on full heat,' he added.

Recorder Bernard Gateshill told the defendants: 'You all participated in an attack upon (the victim) which was designed to embarrass and humiliate him.'

Earles, of Scarborough, was spared a jail sentence because she had spent five months on remand and was 'clearly a troubled woman with a history of psychological difficulties'.

She was given a two-year community order with supervision, ordered to attend the Women's Community Project in Scarborough for a 20-day course, and made to pay a £60 victim surcharge.

Teale, of Malton, was jailed for 12 months for actual bodily harm, burglary and the handling offence.

Lilley, of Scarborough, was given a two-year community order with supervision and 100 hours' unpaid work.

White was also given a two-year community punishment and ordered to take part in a 16-day course at the Women's Community Project.
