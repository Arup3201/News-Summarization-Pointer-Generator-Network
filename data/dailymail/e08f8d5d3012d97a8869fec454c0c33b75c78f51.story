Pedro hit a first-half hat-trick as Barcelona cruised into the last 16 of the Copa del Rey with a 8-1 second leg demolition of lower league Huesca at the Camp Nou on Tuesday.

Barca fielded a second string side without Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez following their 4-0 first leg win and it was the chance for Pedro to shine with his third treble for the club.

He nodded home the opener after 20 minutes and then finished clinically from an Andres Iniesta pass.
