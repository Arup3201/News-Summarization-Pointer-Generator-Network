Police are warning people not to approach a convicted murderer who has escaped from a mental health centre. 

Lerone Michael Boye, 27, walked out of the medium security John Howard Centre in Kenworthy Road, Homerton, east London, at about 2pm today.

He was sentenced to life last December for the murder of Kelvin Chibueze and told he must serve a minimum of 28 years.

Convicted murderer Lerone Michael Boye, 27, (left) walked out of the medium security unit on Wednesday. He was part of a gang that murdered Kevin Chibueze (right)  

His 17-year-old victim was fatally stabbed at the Arteflex Club in Ilford High Road, east London, on August 15 2011.

He was chased out of a birthday party and attacked with glass and broken bottles.

Boye's three co-accused are also serving life sentences.

Boye is described as black, about 5ft 10in and of slim build with short black hair and a goatee beard.

He has a horseshoe-shaped scar on his right cheek.

He escaped from the John Howard Centre in Homerton, east London, on Wednesday

He was last seen wearing grey jogging bottoms and a grey or blue sweatshirt with a grey vest over the top.

He is known to have links to the Ilford area.

Members of the public have been warned not to approach him but call 999.

East London NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the centre, says it has launched an investigation into Boye's escape.

A John Howard Centre spokesman told the BBC: 'The trust is working with the police to assist them with their investigation.

'We are reviewing our security as a matter of urgency.'

At
last years trial, Boye was identified by Judge John Bevan as a 
ringleader of the attack, along with fellow murderer Dale Williams.

'To say those originally in the dock did not know who inflicted the fatal injuries is nonsense', said Judge Bevan.

'That, of course, is a secret they are not going to divulge.'

Anyone with any information about Boye's whereabouts can also call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
