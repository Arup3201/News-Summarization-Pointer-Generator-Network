Senator John McCain accidentally made Hillary Clinton 'leader of the free world' - if only for a second.

The senior senator from Arizona and former GOP presidential nominee was responding on CBS' Face the Nation to a compliment from Clinton calling him her 'favorite Republican.'

He uncomfortably laughed it off before mistakenly elevating her to the job she's expected to campaign for in 2016.

'I hope this part of the program is blacked out in Arizona - please cut,' he joked as he made a slashing gesture over his neck. 'I respect Secretary, Senator Clinton. I respect 
her views. We have had disagreements on a number of issues.'

He then acknowledged Clinton's frontrunner status in a rather unorthodox way.

'I think it's my job to work with every president,' McCain said, before quickly adding while comically contorting his face with mock fear, 'If she is - regrettably - if she attains the presidency.'

He then went on to describe his experiences working with her and other Democrats in the Senate in efforts to solve important issues. 

'How do you do that? You got to reach across the aisle and work together 
on certain issues,' he said. 'And I’m not only not embarrassed about that, I’m proud of it and I respect Hillary Clinton though I may not agree with her.'

The Face the Nation incident was certainly a gaffe, but it may in some ways have been a Freudian slip.

A few hawkish Republicans are beginning to warm up to a Hillary Clinton presidency as their own party takes an isolationist turn, according to The New York Times. And Clinton herself is considered by some so-called Neocons to favor a muscular US foreign policy.
