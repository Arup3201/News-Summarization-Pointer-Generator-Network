This allows the video to draw special attention to the shoes, focusing in on the girls' legs as they stroll through the countryside and hop onto motorcycles.

In the opening scene, a nude Poppy Delevingne is seen pulling on a pair of suede knee-high boots and jumping on a bicycle, the camera zooming in on her feet as she pushes the pedals.

In another scene, Dylan Penn stands next to a motorcycle wearing just a bodysuit and black leather biker boots with thick buckles, which cost $535, her face only shown in the motorcycle's mirror. 

The 23-year-old model, whose parents are Robin Wright and Sean Penn, then poses on a red sports car with Poppy, showing off their long and runway-ready legs.

According to a press release, the film takes cues from vintage Playboy magazines, using the same warm light and grainy images to 'add mystery to an undeniably sensual aesthetic'.

'With an emphasis on 60s fashion, the film mirrors the signature style of that era with a sex kitten twist on modern sensuality,' it reads.

Indeed, Poppy and Dylan sport several retro-inspired outfits in the short film, from swingy minidresses to fuzzy knit sweaters and round, wide-framed sunglasses.

Rock Roll Ride premiered on Monday during Paris Fashion Week at the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild, to an audience that included Miranda Kerr, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and CR Fashion book editor-in-chief, Carine Roitfeld, the director's mother.

'As a creative director, I think secretly I always wanted to direct a movie,' Julia said.

Best pals: The girls clearly became close while shooting the movie

Reliable: 'I have always loved how simple and classic the shoes have been. I can always count on a good pair of Stuart Weitzman heels, since my first bat mitzvah party to now,' Dylan said of the designer

'And when Stuart Weitzman approached me to direct their fourth short film, I immediately said yes because I'm obsessed with shoes.'

Dylan, who first launched into the public eye in 2013 when she was romantically linked to Robert Pattinson, told the Hollywood Reporter that she enjoyed being part of the film because she has been a fan of the designer since she was young.

'I have always loved how simple and classic the shoes have been. I can always count on a good pair of Stuart Weitzman heels, since my first bat mitzvah party to now,' she said.
