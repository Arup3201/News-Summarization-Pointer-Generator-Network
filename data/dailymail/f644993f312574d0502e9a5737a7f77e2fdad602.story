This is the heartbreaking moment a terminally ill two-year-old boy - given just weeks to live - was his father's best man when he got married to his mother today.

Brave leukaemia sufferer Charlie Harris-Beard brought tears to the eyes of the 300-strong congregation as he delivered the rings to his parents in his favourite remote controlled car.

Bride Fiona Harris, 30, and groom Joe Beard, 30, decided to bring their wedding date forward after doctors broke the devastating news that Charlie only had weeks to live.

The couple tied the knot at St Mary’s Church in their home town of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, this morning.

The emotional 45-minute service included the hymns ‘Morning Has Broken’ and ‘Shine, Jesus, Shine’, as well as a solo performance of ‘You Are My Sunshine’ by a family friend.

But brave Charlie stole the show when he was driven down the aisle in his remote control, blue Audi car - with the rings safe on a cushion on its bonnet.

Despite his terminal illness, the lovable tot was lively throughout the service and smiled for pictures with guests.

Speaking after he had married the emotional couple, Canon Owain Bell said: “It’s a completely unique wedding.

'It took place as quickly as could be and it could only have happened because people were willing to drop everything and be here.

'Charlie coming up in his car was amazing. They are going to treasure the photographs forever.There was a lot of love and a lot of joy in the church today.'

A family friend added: 'That was a beautiful service. It didn’t matter that it was arranged so quickly, it was just perfect.

'Charlie was as good as gold but we all knew he would be. He’s such a sweetheart and is an incredible fighter.

'It’s been a terrible time for the family but it was nice to have a day full of smiles to remember forever.'

Charlie was best man at the wedding along with his godfather Phil Senior - while the couple’s daughter Ellie-Louise, 12, was one of six bridesmaids.

Bride Fiona arrived at the church in a white old fashioned Rolls Royce minutes before the service began at 1.20pm and the married couple left in the car together at 2.45pm.

Brave Charlie was first diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia on Easter Sunday last year.He returned home from hospital in January following a successful bone marrow transplant using using stem cells from an American baby’s umbilical cord.

But last week, his devastated parents revealed on their Facebook page ‘Help save baby Charlie Harris-Beard’, which has 17, 000 followers, that the cancer had returned.

Doctors told the family the toddler has just weeks to live - causing Fiona and Joe to make the drastic decision of bringing their wedding forward.

Despite being told the toddler’s cancer is terminal, dad Joe has vowed the family won’t give up and are ringing hospitals all over the world.

Speaking before the wedding, Joe said: 'We hope and pray that they can do something out there. It’s a long shot but we’re trying to still keep going and see if we can find something.

'To find out the cancer had returned was absolutely devastating but we can’t give up.

'We will keep going and keep trying to find something. We’re trying to put as many smiles on his face as possible.

'We’ve been ringing hospitals all over the world trying to get through to different doctors.'

Speaking about how brave his son has been, Joe added: 'He’s touched a lot of people’s hearts. He smiles all the time, even when he’s going through pain. That’s amazing to see.

'He’s got through a cancer which is really rare in children and he’s had all the adult treatment in terms of chemotherapy.

'He wakes up and the first thing he says is ‘Daddy can I go in my car?’ - he just wants to play. He’s been battling for 21 months so he’s put in a good battle.

'He’s worked hard and fought it a long time.'
