Almost three weeks after the summer transfer window closed, the Premier League table is showing significant signs that clubs do not need to be big net spenders to improve their teams. Or net spenders at all, in fact.

Of the six lowest net spenders among the 20 clubs during the window, it is extraordinary to note that five them are currently sitting within the top six places in the table. 

The six lowest net spenders were: Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea, who made respective net profits of £30.7m, £6.5m and £0.8m from their summer trading, and Stoke, Swansea and Aston Villa, who respectively had net spend of just £0.4m, £1.3m and £5.9m.

Chelsea bought Diego Costa for £32m but made a net profit and are top of the Premier League

Tottenham were another side to make a net profit in a summer in which they signed defender Eric Dier

These are early days in the season, with just four games played in the League so far. But net earners Chelsea are top with a 100 per cent cent record, followed by unbeaten Villa, then Swansea and Southampton in the Champions League berths, with Tottenham in sixth.

The Premier League table shows five of the most prudent spenders in the early top six

This is not to say that massive net spending won’t pay dividends in time. Manchester United spent a net sum of £122m on players including Argentinian star Angel di Maria, a British record buy at £60m. Louis van Gaal’s new-look side already look a different proposition after his spree.

Arsenal, with £46.4m net spend, are also in the top 10 in the table and strongly fancied to finish in the top four yet again, while Liverpool, Everton and Manchester City (with respective net spend of £35.7m, £32.8m and £32m) all aspire to Champions League football next season, too.

Yet the early lesson from the window is it’s not how much cash you can splash that matters, but how it is spent. Chelsea offloaded David Luiz and Romelu Lukaku for large sums, as well as Demba Ba and Patrick van Aanholt but crucial was the reinvestment in Diego Costa (top scorer in the league so far with seven goals in four games), Cesc Fabregas and Loic Remy among others.

Southampton’s sale of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert prompted suggestions of meltdown and relegation. But among their replacements, Graziano Pelle is joint second-highest scorer in the league this season, Fraser Forster is one of the most impressive early-season goalkeepers and Dusan Tadic is showing signs he could excel as an orchestrator in place of Lallana.

And Southampton made more than £30m profit.

Manchester United are bottom of the net spend table - which is unsurprising given that they spent more than £150m in the summer, including the £60m British record signing of Angel di Maria

Alexis Sanchez was Arsenal's big buy of the summer and contributed to their net loss

Liverpool spent £16m on Mario Balotelli as they splurged following the sale of Luis Suarez

Swansea under Garry Monk are also performing above expectation, after a net spend of £1.3m, or equivalent to less than one quarter of Radamel Falcao’s one-year loan fee at Manchester United. That £1.3m is also approximately one-tenth of what United will spend on the Colombia star’s wages alone this season.

Tottenham’s trading left them in the profit, meanwhile, something Mauricio Pochettino may not have envisaged when he jumped ship from Southampton. Then again his remit is to make Spurs more than the sum of their parts, not spend a load of money. The same is true at Villa, where a modest net outlay has been no hindrance to a good start, so far.
