A teenager was killed in a shoot-out comparable to a 'Western' movie, a court has heard.

Mohammed Hussein, 19, part of a notorious North London gang, was killed by rival gang members with a sawn-off shotgun, the jury was told.

The alleged murder, which took place around a tower block, was caught on CCTV cameras.

Mohammed Hussein, 19, was killed in a 'Western'-style shoot-out, Kingston Crown Court heard

The jury was told that Mr Hussein, a member of the Get Money Gang (GMG), was shot by rivals from Dem Africans (DA) on April 1.

Natneal Tesfay, 21, is on trial for firing two shots at Mr Hussein two years after a member of the DA gang, Negus McLean, 15, was stabbed to death of a street less than half a mile away.

Around the time of the shooting, four members of Mr Hussein's gang were due to stand trial for this murder, the jury heard.

According to The Independent, Simon Denison, QC, for the prosecution, said: 'This case is a terrifying example of how cheap life is among teenage gang members in London.

He added: 'What happened was like something out of the old western movies, except it was not American fiction, it was reality, in a public car park in north London.

'And it was captured by a CCTV camera that overlooked the car park.'

The court was told that three men, including Tesfay, were seen walking out of Walbrook House, in Edmonton, to intercept Mr Hussein after he had arrived in a black BMW minutes earlier.

Mr Hussein was said to have been with two friends..

In the silent CCTV footage, Tesfay is allegedly seen pulling a sawn-off shotgun out a carrier bag before firing two shots at Mr Hussein.

The jury heard the second shot hit him in the chest and he was left dying in an alleyway.

An unidentified friend of Mr Hussein then pointed his own gun at the rival gang, the court heard.

The CCTV showed he was then chased by two defendants back to the BMW when he was driven away.

The car then drove back around to Mr Hussein's body but drove off as passers-by attempted to save Mr Hussein's life.

Mr Tesfay, 21, alleged to have fired the gun, Christopher Aluma, 19, a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and Simeon Birde, 19, all deny murder.

The court was told that Mr Tesfay is likely to claim that he shot at Mr Hussein out of self-defence.

The two gangs are based in neighbouring areas in Enfield and Edmonton, in North London.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
