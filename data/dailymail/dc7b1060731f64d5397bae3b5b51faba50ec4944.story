UPS sent out thousands of extra workers Thursday in scramble to deliver packages that had failed to arrive in time for Christmas as the No. 1 U.S. ground delivery service sought to stem the the growing fallout from the delays.

The company's Facebook and Twitter became sounding boards over the past week for likely thousands of livid customers whose holidays were ruined by delays caused by a surge in online shopping the company simply couldn't handle.

Along with 2,600 extra employees, the company has been forced to stick some 900 managers behind delivery truck wheels in order to meet a Friday deadline for the delivery of delayed packages it set for itself Christmas day.

Scramble: UPS is scrambling to make up for its disastrous Christmas delays by sending out 2,600 extra workers and putting 900 managers behind the wheels of delivery trucks nationwide

UPS said on Wednesday that a confluence of factors from bad weather, a shorter shopping season and a surge in online shopping were to blame. It stressed that only a small percentage of total packages were delayed.

The Associated Press spoke to people in Alabama, California, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia who didn't receive presents in time for Christmas.

The company refused Thursday, along with its smaller rival FedEx Corp, to reveal how many packages had been delayed.

However, judging from the backlash, the impact of the delays were far reaching.

Ups and downs: UPS, the worlds largest parcel delivery service experienced overwhelming demand after a flurry of last-minute only Christmas purchases

When UPS posted a 'Merry Christmas' 
message on its Facebook page on December 25, hundreds of furious 
customers replied with stories of how their holiday season would not be 
bright because UPS failed to deliver in time.

'UPS ruined my Christmas,' Katherine McEachen of Fairfield, Connecticut, told NBC News. 

Ms McEachen said she sent her father a custom-made coffee mug with 'I love you' and a photo of the moment she was able to overcome her lupus and help them cut down a Christmas tree this year. None of them arrived for Christmas.

'It's just a mug, but it was supposed to be so special and it's the only way I can say those words to him,' she said. 

UPS truck driver Larry Ledet posted this comment on a Facebook page which drew angry responses from customers

Customers responded to the driver's remark that he had worked a 60-hour week trying to get all the packages delivered

Jill Amaya, of Houston, Texas, shipped her entire family's Christmas presents to her sister's home in Dallas week ago. They still had not arrived by Christmas Eve.

'I ordered my three-year-old grandson's entire Christmas on December 11. I received notice that it had been shipped December 13... the updated delivery date is Dec 27

'A little late for a 3 year olds Christmas... By the way, my 3 year old grandson was adopted out of a horrible situation in July and this is his first Christmas,' fumed Robbie Escalon of Amarillo, Texas. 

Widespread: Both UPS and its smaller rival FedEx experienced delays over the holiday. While both companies refuse to reveal the exact number of delayed packages, the problem appears to have been far more widespread with UPS

Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako said in an email that orders were sent to delivery companies on time for holiday shipping and that the company was 'reviewing the performance of the delivery carriers.'

Osako said shipping charges for late packages would be refunded and affected shoppers would receive $20 gift cards, though she did not provide a number of how many shipments were delayed.

UPS says there was simply too much demand and the company couldn't keep up with the last minute shipments as 'the volume of air packages in our system exceeded the capacity of our network,' according to a statement.

'We're terribly sorry,' UPS spokeswoman Natalie Black told CNN.

'A small percentage of shipments are delayed and will not be delivered today,' another spokesperson told USA Today.

Dissatisfied customers had been piping up for days, but their complaints became a chorus as hope they'd receive their packages in time for the holiday faded Christmas Eve

However, workers behind the scenes continued working over the holiday to ensure packages would be ready to go out Thursday.

'There will be an afternoon sort today,' Ms Black said. 'Workers will be processing packages so that tomorrow, bright and early, our drivers can clear out the remaining excess air volume. 'We expect that air volume to be delivered between tomorrow and Friday.'

While UPS stopped making delivery date guarantees for ground packages on December 11, senders of next day air packages were told their shipments would arrive by Christmas Eve as late as Monday.
