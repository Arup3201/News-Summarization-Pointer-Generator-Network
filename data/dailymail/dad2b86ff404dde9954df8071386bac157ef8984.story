Christian GP Richard Scott outside the GMC hearing in Manchester

A Christian doctor spoke of his disgust last night after he claimed he was being  put on trial for discussing his faith with a patient.

Dr Richard Scott vented his fury at the General Medical Council for persisting with a misconduct tribunal even though the patient involved refused to turn up to give evidence.

The 24-year-old man was un-named and the GMC even kept details of his faith secret, on the grounds of ‘patient confidentiality’.

Speaking after the case was adjourned, Dr Scott, a 51-year-old GP, said: ‘I’m actually not only disappointed, I’m disgusted with my professional body. When I started in medicine, you were led to believe the GMC were there to serve both patients and doctors. That is not the case. I think there is an anti-Christian bias with the GMC.’

The Scott case is the latest in a series of incidents in which hospitals and medical authorities have been perceived as acting to suppress any expression of Christian beliefs. One case, that of a nurse ordered off the wards because she refused to take off her crucifix, is shortly to be heard at the European Court of Human Rights.

Dr Scott spoke to the 24-year-old patient, described as suicidal and vulnerable, at the end of a consultation at the Bethesda Medical Centre in Margate in August last year. The practice declares its Christian orientation and informs prospective patients that they may be offered spiritual guidance as well as medical help.

The GP is said to have suggested to the patient that they might discuss religion. The patient is believed to have replied ‘go for it’ and Dr Scott told him about the ‘additional help which he might derive from Jesus’ and added that he might feel better if he prayed, as the patient’s own religion did not appear to be giving him comfort.

The patient’s mother, who had 
recommended Dr Scott to her son, complained ‘weeks later’. The patient 
himself did not complain until three months after the consultation, when
he said he had been ‘very upset’ and his own faith had been belittled. 
The patient did not appear at yesterday’s hearing. He has informed the 
GMC it would be a ‘big inconvenience’ and he would not attend ‘for a 
million pounds’.

The misconduct charge could end in a 
warning to Dr Scott from the GMC Investigation Committee. It could also 
lead to an instruction to the GP to appear before a future fitness to 
practice hearing, which in turn could strip him of his right to work as a
doctor.

During the hearing, lawyers for the 
professional body said the GP had ‘crossed the line’ when he discussed 
his own faith with a patient.

Outside, Dr Scott said the misconduct 
hearing amounted to religious persecution. He added: ‘I think within 
medicine a lot is science based, so secular beliefs have a very strong 
voice. Other Christians in medicine and nursing have increasingly been 
under attack.’

Dr Scott said he had been angered at 
the complaint of the patient’s mother that he had not done anything 
medical in the consultation. ‘That was shown to be a fabrication, they 
should have thrown it out,’ he said.

‘At the end of it, he didn’t like what
I was saying, he called me an idiot, which is his right, and asked me 
to stop. He knew this is a Christian surgery.’

Andrea Williams of the Christian Legal
Centre, which is supporting Dr Scott, said: ‘We think every GP should 
be concerned by the way their professional body has acted. First of all 
they pursued Dr Scott for 14 months, then they arrived at court without 
the principal witness thinking they could prove their case  on hearsay.’

Paul Ozin, for the GMC, said: ‘There 
is no possible question of an abusive process. The reason why attempts 
were not made to obtain Patient A was because no request was made until 
last Friday by those who represent Dr Scott, which was well out of the 
notice period.’

The hearing was adjourned until the witness can appear.
