He may be without a club, but Jermaine Pennant has finally stirred some interest after he was nominated for the Ice Bucket Challenge by his model wife Alice Goodwin.

The model uploaded the video to her Instagram account on Wednesday showing off her physique in just a bikini as she accepted the challenge after nominating Pennant for the fundraising challenge in aid of ALS, a charity fighting motor-neurone disease or Lou Gehrig's Disease.

The couple had been dating for two years before they got married at a private ceremony in Cheshire in May.

Pennant is currently a free agent since being released by Stoke City in January.

The tricky winger started his career at Notts County before joining Arsenal aged 15 for £2million.

He has since played for Birmingham, Liverpool, Real Zaragoza and Stoke before being released by Potters manager Mark Hughes. 

The 31-year-old was arrested for drink driving in 2005 and 2012.

He famously was the first Premier League player to wear a tag during a match, for Birmingham against Tottenham in 2005.
