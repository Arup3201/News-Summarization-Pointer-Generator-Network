With just two weeks to go until the final U.S. troops are expected to withdraw from Iraq, it was business as usual today in a Baghdad market.

Vendors at the Bab al-Sharji market have seen an increase in the number of U.S. army items available to sell.

Among the 'trophies' are everyday items ranging from detergents, wallets, glasses, bags and meals.

However, the market sellers are worried about losing their jobs when the U.S. military - their best customers as well as stock providers - pulls out of Iraq at the end of the month.

President Barack Obama is today 
expected to wind down the most unpopular U.S. military venture since 
Vietnam by declaring an end to another war without victory.

Mr
Obama's visit to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, will be a chance to tout 
the completion of a troop pull-out from Iraq by year-end.

This will fulfil a promise that helped him win the presidency in 2008 and which he hopes will help him keep it in 2012.

But
even as the last American forces pack up and leave in the final days of
a costly, nearly nine-year engagement, the debate over Mr Obama's exit 
strategy remains as heated as ever at home - and most experts say it 
could be years before history delivers a clear verdict.

Thomas
Schwartz, professor of history and politics at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, Tennessee, said: 'War-weariness means most Americans just 
want to see Iraq over and done with.

'But like Vietnam, there are risks and unintended consequences that will take time to sort out.'

Having
inherited the Iraq war as well as the withdrawal timetable from his 
predecessor George W Bush, Mr Obama is gambling that Iraq is now stable 
enough to deal internally with a still-dangerous insurgency and 
externally with any threat from neighbouring Iran.

Yet to paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, Mr Bush's former defence secretary, unknowns - both known and unknown - abound.

Will
violent Islamic radicals, never completely defeated, resurge? Will 
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government drift, as critics charge, 
toward a strong-arm model? Will Iraq's minority Kurds be satisfied with 
their partial autonomy?

Mr 
Obama, however, has never wavered from his pledge to end a war that 
claimed the lives of nearly 4,500 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of 
Iraqis and inflicted lasting damage to America's standing worldwide.

'It's cost us probably over $1trillion, when all is said and done,' Mr Obama told a Virginia television station yesterday.

The
president's critics, from Republican presidential challengers to 
neo-conservative policy experts, contend that the timing of the U.S. 
pull-out is based on electoral considerations and will jeopardise gains 
on the ground and embolden Iran.

Along
with the U.S. economic downturn in 2008, Mr Obama owes his presidency 
in no small measure to his opposition to the Iraq war.

As
an Illinois state legislator, he gave a stirring speech in 2002 warning
that invading Iraq would plunge the U.S. into a 'dumb war'.

Mr
Bush launched the invasion in 2003 based on claims of weapons of mass 
destruction and Al-Qaeda ties that turned out not to exist.

Mr
Obama gained momentum using his anti-war stance to distinguish himself 
from top Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential 
primaries by insisting that unlike her he never would have voted in 
Congress to go to war in Iraq.

He
then capitalised on voters' growing disillusionment over Iraq to help 
him defeat Republican opponent John McCain, a leading supporter of Mr 
Bush's Iraq policy.

In 
office, Mr Obama moved quickly to scale back what his aides had dubbed 
'Bush's war' and to shift military focus to Afghanistan and its border 
with Pakistan, which he called the neglected battleground in the fight 
against Al-Qaeda.

Long slog: Former President George W Bush launched the invasion of Iraq in 2003 based on claims of weapons of mass destruction and Al-Qaeda ties that turned out not to exist

Commentators
now see that conflict as 'Obama's war' and believe his legacy as a 
wartime president will rise and fall more on the outcome of the 
Afghanistan-Pakistan campaign than on any developments in Iraq.

With
the curtain coming down on U.S. military involvement in Iraq, Mr Obama 
will use his speech to returning troops at Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd 
Airborne Division, to put a capstone on a war that strained America's 
armed forces.

He would have 
preferred to keep at least several thousand troops in Iraq as trainers 
but failed to reach a deal with Iraq's fractious government - another 
source of Republican criticism of his leadership.

As of Tuesday, there were about 5,500 U.S. troops left in Iraq, down from more than 170,000 at the height of the war.

Mr
Obama will now try to capitalise politically on the moment - even 
though the December 2011 deadline was actually set by Mr Bush after he 
ordered a 'surge' of troops that helped pull Iraq back from the brink of
civil war.

But what Mr Obama wants to avoid is the impression that he is taking a victory lap, aides say.

The
White House is mindful of Mr Bush's landing on the deck of the aircraft
carrier USS Abraham Lincoln draped with a 'Mission Accomplished' banner
and his declaration of an end to major combat operations in May 2003. 
The stunt was widely ridiculed, given that the worst of Iraq's 
insurgency was yet to come.
