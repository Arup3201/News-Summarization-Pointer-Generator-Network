Under Nobel Peace Prize-winning President Barack Obama, America's nuclear weapons spending will eclipse $1 trillion over the next 30 years as the United States spent more in 2014 on its arsenal than at any time in its history – including during the Cold War and World War II.

The stunning news from The New York Times comes just five years after a newly minted Obama won the Prize for, in part, using international diplomacy to further a 'vision of a world free from nuclear arms.'

The Nobel committee wrote just nine months after Obama took office that his creation of a 'new climate in international politics' had already led to 'dialogue and negotiations' being 'preferred as instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts.'

'The vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations,' Obama's award citation read, describing his accomplishments.

But the Times reported Monday on its front page that a massive effort to revitalize and refurbish America's crumbling nuclear weapons resources has become a spending sprint, catapulting the U.S. past Cold War levels.

A 'vision of a world free from nuclear arms': Obama collected his Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, given in part for his pledges related to nuclear disarmament on a global scale

Obama campaigned in 2008 on a platform that included achieving 'a nuclear-free world,' and sought to nudge the country in that direction by modestly rebuilding America's nukes in order to make them more convincing leverage in discussions about global cuts in the number of warheads.

But as Congress sunk its teeth in new home-district spending opportunities and both Russia and China have seized opportunities to rattle sabers, the atomic reboot has taken on a life of its own.

As a result, the Department of Energy and the Atomic Energy Commission spent upwards of $11 billion this year on nuclear weapons research, development, testing and production. 

That number doesn't include any Defense Department spending on aircraft, missile silos or staffing to keep the nuclear button a viable option in the event of a first-strike by one of America's enemies.

The Brookings Institution estimated in 1998 that the entirety of the Manhattan Project and other spending on nuclear weapons research and production from 1940 to 1945 amounted to $30.3 billion, in 2014 dollars.

That six-year figure is less than the projected U.S. nuclear spending for each of the next 30 years, according to a January 2014 research paper published by the Monterey Institute of International Studies, a graduate school of the far-left-leaning Middlebury College in Vermont. 

The ramp-up of spending has left some of Obama's early supporters dumbfounded.

Quaint? The 1983 film 'War Games' portrayed nuclear weapons buildups as a sure road to global ruin, but America has never changed its deterrence strategy

Cheap: The atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima in 1945 came from a government program that spent less in five years than the US will spend on its successor in each of the next 30

Ageing: America's nuclear launch facilities are an often-derided throwback to the 1970s, with antiquated computers that spending advocates argue are in desperate need of replacement

'A lot of it is hard to explain,' former Democratic U.S. Senator Sam Nunn told the Times. 'The president's vision was a significant change in direction. But the process has preserved the status quo.'

But as geopolitics shift, the appetite for weakening America's offensive weaponry has all but disappeared.

'The most fundamental game changer is Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,' Gary Samore, Obama’s principal nuclear adviser during his first term added. 'That has made any measure to reduce the stockpile unilaterally politically impossible.'

The game changed earlier than that, however. 

The 1.5 million-square-foot Kansas City National Security Campus opened last month after $687 million of spending that was authorized in the waning months of the George W. Bush presidency.

'The successful construction of the National Security Campus here in Kansas City is part of our broader effort to transform our Cold War era infrastructure into a 21st century nuclear security enterprise,' Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said during a dedication ceremony.

And with that modernization, the U.S. is pot-committed in the never-ending high stakes poker game that is global nuclear diplomacy.

CHANGE: Obama promised to work for nuclear disarmament in 2008 as a presidential candidate -- something that hasn't made America's 21st-century foes budge much

Crumbling: Many of America's long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles are in dire need of refurbishment, and some of suspected of not being able to perform as intended

Former Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman told the Times that 'the whole design of the modernization enables us to make reductions' in spending in the future.

The new plant, officials say, will save $150 million in energy costs each year. That number, however, may be part of an endless stream of pledges from the Obama administration that have yet to bear fruit.

A senior aide to a Republican senator who will be involved in budget negotiations for the 2016 fiscal year – a haggling process that will begin in January or February – told MailOnline that there will likely be opposition from both sides of the aisle if Obama proposes any kind of cuts.

'Democrats don't want their 2016 [presidential] candidate to have to run on a legacy of weakness,' he said. 'Plus, in the Senate they've never seen a spending bill they couldn't excuse.'

'And some Republicans,' he offered, 'are still pining for Reagan's "peace through strength" years from the Soviet days. With Putin going crazy, we might need that outlook again.'
