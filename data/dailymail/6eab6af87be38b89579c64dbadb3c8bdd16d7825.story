All eyes may be on Martin Freeman when he brings Shakespeare’s Machiavellian Richard III to life on stage – but for traditional theatregoers, the very worst villains are in the audience.

Fans of the Hobbit star have been accused of breaching ‘theatre etiquette’ by cheering the actor’s very first scene, during which he delivers the soliloquy starting ‘Now is the winter of our discontent’.

Conventionally, audiences break into applause only at the beginning of the interval and  at the final curtain.

However, enthusiastic Hobbit fans, many of whom are first-time theatregoers, have been accused of ruining some of Shakespeare’s most spellbinding moments with their ‘annoying’ and ‘disruptive’ bursts of applause.

One audience member, theatre  blogger Claire Dikecoglu, said last night: ‘After the opening monologue some fans tried to kick off clapping and cheering, which I found to be disruptive and unnecessary.

‘There are strong views on this,  but I was irritated when the audience interrupted the flow of the play to clap and cheer Martin’s first scene.’

Miss Dikecoglu, who was sitting in the front row for the show’s preview at London’s Trafalgar Studios, added: ‘While I am not a traditionalist in terms of dramaturgy, I do believe  in proper theatre etiquette.

‘It’s a first preview and there were mistakes. I understand that Martin Freeman is popular, but I have no  bigger pet peeve than everything  getting standing ovations these days.’

Celebrated actress Dame Eileen Atkins agreed that applauding someone during the middle of a production was ‘wrong’.

She said: ‘It ultimately breaks the spell of the story. I think that what  is happening is because of the success of The Hobbit. Martin Freeman is attracting a different kind of audience who are not used to the theatre. Judi Dench is a big name, but I don’t think that her audience would behave in that fashion.’

Haydn Gwynne, who co-starred opposite Kevin Spacey in The Old Vic’s 2011 production of Richard III, said applauding a star during a play could be ‘undemocratic’.

She added: ‘If people clap at the beginning, then there is a danger they are being taken out of  the story. It should not be about the famous person.  It should be about the play and the role.’

And Maureen Lipman, who is about to star in the West End production of Daytona, also blamed the over-zealous applause  on the fact that Freeman’s starring role in The Hobbit trilogy had attracted a much younger audience to the show. She said: ‘Martin Freeman’s face is on every bus  in London.

The producers are going out to find the Hobbit audience.  They are spending a fortune to target them.’She added: ‘The director tweeted the other day about the fact that the first two rows could expect to find themselves spattered in fake blood. 

‘They are aiming for people who spend most of their day with wire in their ears. It is not so much Richard III as Richard the rock concert.’

However, Oscar-winning dramatist Christopher Hampton, who is one  of Britain’s most successful playwrights, said he had no problem with people showing appreciation for actors in the middle of a play.

Mr Hampton, whose hits include Les Liaisons Dangereuses and the musical Sunset Boulevard, said: ‘Attracting first-time theatregoers is the holy grail as far as we are all concerned. We want them to come as much as possible.’ He added: ‘I love it when people applaud in the middle  of the play. I am all for people having a good time in the theatre and if they want to express themselves like that, I don’t see any harm in it.’

Last night Freeman, who has also appeared in TV hit Sherlock, was unavailable for comment, but Richard III director Jamie Lloyd stepped in to defend the production’s enthusiastic reception.

He said: ‘The show’s standing ovations have been instant, to reward the entire cast, not just Martin. They don’t wait for Martin to come on for his bow. I think that we are seeing an authentic, enthusiastic reaction from a generational muddle in the audience.

‘Younger, first-time theatregoers are more vocal and they are certainly screaming their appreciation at the end.’
