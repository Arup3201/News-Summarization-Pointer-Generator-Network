Online addiction: Tallulah Wilson, 15, was found dead on the tracks at St Pancras station, a day after her mother discovered her alter ego

The mother of a talented teenager who plunged to her death in front of a train told yesterday how she had become addicted to self-harming websites before her death.

Tallulah Wilson, 15, was found dead at St Pancras station in London.

Her mother Sarah yesterday wept as she told how her daughter had become hooked on websites where internet users encouraged her to harm herself.

She said she had been horrified to find pictures of her daughter self-harming online on the photo-sharing website Tumblr. ‘It was pictures of her cutting herself,’ she said. ‘It’s like the worst horror movie you have ever seen in your house. I realised there were young girls on there cutting themselves to see who is worse.

‘It’s unbelievable. I saw one girl post a picture with a noose, and the picture said “here’s your new necklace, try it on”. It’s shocking what these young people are up to. All these girls are basically trying to outdo each other.’

Mrs Wilson said she had desperately tried to keep her daughter off the extreme websites but the teenager refused to listen.

Tallulah, a talented rider and dancer who lived with her family in a £1million house in West Hampstead, North London, had a bright future and had apparently been headhunted by the Royal Ballet school. But she had been  bullied at St Marylebone school in St Pancras which she attended until the summer term of 2012.

Mrs Wilson told the court: ‘Some of the girls in that school were horrible. She didn’t handle my mum’s death very well either, they were very close and she died in 2011.’

Tragedy: Her body was found on the tracks at St Pancras station in London in October 2012

Hearing: Her mother Sarah told St Pancras Coroner's Court how her daughter's lies had 'spiralled out of control'

She started at the £11,000-a-year St 
Margaret’s School in Hampstead in September 2012, weeks before her death
 on October 14. By this time she had become addicted to extreme 
websites, her mother said. The teenager had regularly posted troubling 
messages on Twitter, including ‘I will never be beautiful and skinny’ 
and ‘I have absolutely no plan for my future’.

In
 other messages posted in the months before her death, she claimed: ‘I 
struggle with anorexia’, and said she had been sent to an institution 
which, she implied, treated the illness. She tweeted: ‘Haven’t been to 
#school in over 6months. #Recovery failed but – still have to go back 
#kmn [kill me now] #anorexic.’

She
 also wrote: ‘never ever OD again, my head is so so bad’ and ‘I still 
cant get the frikin marks off from the heart monitors at hospital’. One 
of her final messages was: ‘why the **** should I stay if no one around 
me stay for me? I’m done. I’m ****ing done #suicide #goodbye.’

The
 night before her death on October 14, 2012, her mother found she had 
created a fantasy online persona for herself, the inquest at St Pancras 
Coroners Court heard.

She 
had gained 18,000 followers on sites such as Twitter and Tumblr after 
posting about drinking and taking cocaine, and uploading pictures of 
herself with cuts she had made in order to impress her fans.

She had reportedly been bullied at St Marylebone School (pictured) before moving to the £11,000-a-year St Maragaret's School in Hampstead, London

Mrs
 Wilson wept as she told the court: ‘She didn’t think she could have 
friends in the real world. I told her it wasn’t real. It was sucking the
 life out of her. It was scary.’

She
 said her daughter had gone ‘berserk’ when she contacted the website and
 had her profile shut down. ‘She started banging her head against the 
wall. It was horrible.’

One
 night Mrs Wilson believed her daughter had gone upstairs to do 
homework, when in fact she had attempted to take her own life.

Her
 mother was warned of the suicide attempt by a stranger making a phone 
call to the house, with whom the schoolgirl had discussed her plans to 
take an overdose. After that, her mother said, she was ‘on suicide watch
 virtually 24/7.’

Loved: The head of St Margaret's School in Hampstead said Tallulah 'was already a very popular member of our community', despite only having been at the school for a few weeks

The inquest also heard how Tallulah had been 
‘obsessed’ with the death of another girl at her dance school. Tallulah 
was on her way to dance class when mother last saw her. ‘I said to her 
she didn’t have her dance clothes with her and I asked why? She said “I 
don’t need my things today.” And I never saw her again.’

A
 friend of Tallulah, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the 
court: ‘We got to know each other on Tumblr. She was definitely on a 
downward spiral.

‘It seemed like there was a competition with some people, who had the best scar. It was quite sick.’

The
 friend, now 17, urged computer companies to take action to avoid other 
teens experiencing the same problems as Tallulah. She added: ‘There are 
so many people on Tumblr saying they are going to commit suicide, it’s 
hard to say who is telling the truth.’

In
 a statement at the time of her death, Tallulah’s family said: ‘She was a
 clever, cheerful and creative girl with a talent for dance and huge 
potential.’ The inquest continues.
