A much-loved novel about polite society in 19th century England has become an unlikely obsession for a 40-year-old Polish orangutan, according to his zookeeper.

Albert, the literature-loving 200-pound primate at Gdansk Zoo in Poland, is reported to enjoy up to 50 pages a day of Jane Austen's masterpiece Pride And Prejudice, according to the Daily Star.

Keeper Michael Krause resorted to reading the book aloud out of desperation when Albert and partner Raya would not settle down for the night, despite staff trying to wear them out with play or fruit snacks.

Highbrow: Albert likes English literature like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, while partner Raya is a fan of thrillers and drama

The intricacies of class, love, marriage and snobbery in the early 1800s and the riveting relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy soon had the animals gripped.

'I didn't know what to do until I pulled out a book I was reading during a break and within a couple of minutes they were trying to read over my shoulder,' he said.

'Now they go to bed quietly and peacefully as long as they get their stories.'

Michael says that while Albert's favourite book is Pride and Prejudice, which has sold 20 million copies worldwide, he also likes other English writers like Charles Dickens.

Meanwhile Raya likes German fiction, including the Winnetou native American stories by Karl May.

He added: 'But they both like cookery books and when we're doing dramatic readings they like me to act out all the movements.'Â
