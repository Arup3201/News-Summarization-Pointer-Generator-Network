University of Illinois freshman Hye Min Choi, 19, went missing from Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Saturday afternoon

A 19-year-old University of Illinois student mysteriously disappeared after checking in his luggage at Chicago O'Hare international Airport on Saturday afternoon where he was supposed to board a flight home to North Carolina.

Chicago police say that there 'doesn't appear to be any criminality involved' but that Hye Min Choi, 19, was having some 'problems during his first year of school.

'The young man was apparently having some problems in school. We have some leads on where he may be. It appears that he may or not have wanted to go home,' said Supt. Gary McCarthy at a press conference.

'It happens once in a while, by the way, more frequently than you know,' he added.

The Chicago Tribune reports that Choi last checked his baggage at 4:49 p.m. for a United Airlines Flight 5892 headed to Greensboro, North Carolina.

When his mother went to claim her son's baggage in North Carolina there was still no sign of her missing son.

On Monday night the police department issued a public alert asking others to help find any clues of the missing student.

Hye Min Choi is described as 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs approximately 100 pounds.

ABC reported that Choi's family said on Saturday that they spoke to their son at 4:50 p.m. two hours before his flight and he told his family that he was 'hungry.'

They are desperately to find him and are worried about his well-being.

Police would not say yet if they had footage of Choi leaving the airport but they did say that he did not book another United flight.

Choi's family said that their son cannot drive, that he had no reason to leave the airport, and that they were planning a birthday for him.

Choi just completed his freshman year at the University of Illinois where he was majoring in medical engineering.

Anyone with information about Choi's whereabouts is asked to contact the Area North Special Victim's Unit at (312) 744-8200.
