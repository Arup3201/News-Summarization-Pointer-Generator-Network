Liverpool and Manchester United may be two wounded animals, but the pair have a serious backer in Pele, who insists their derby is on a par with El Clasico.

The legendary striker will be at Anfield on Sunday to witness who steals a march in the race for Champions League qualification, asserting that this clash cannot be bettered in world football.

Real Madrid and Barcelona do battle at the Nou Camp on Sunday, but United’s trip to Merseyside will be watched by just as many around the globe.

According to Pele, that is what makes it a standout fixture in the calendar.

‘They are very, very similar games,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It’s one of the best in today’s game. I always look forward to going to Anfield. I love to see good football.

‘Barcelona have excellent players. It’s not only Lionel Messi, but Xavi and Neymar. Maybe they have more individuals, but as a team Liverpool are the same.’

It is quite a show of support for the Premier League, which has a number of questions to address after a dismal fortnight in continental competition, with each of England’s remaining representatives crashing out of Europe.

Pele, who will visit Anfield for the sixth time on Sunday, doesn’t buy into suggestions English football’s power is waning.

‘Oh yes, definitely,’ he said when asked if the Premier League remained the best division in the world. ‘It pains me as a Brazilian, but I have to say that. Even after the problems in Europe.

‘Remember, losing is part of the game. I don’t think there’s anything wrong - it’s something you can’t explain.

‘But there is no doubt that it’s the top league.’

Pele was also forthright in his views on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who he puts on a pedestal with the great Franz Beckenbauer and says would make his World XI.

Asked where Gerrard would rank among the best midfielders of all time, the 74-year-old compared him with Germany’s biggest ever star.

‘Maybe people don’t remember, but Beckenbauer had the same style,’ he added. ‘I like Gerrard, he is a similar intelligent player. There is no doubt they’d both make my team.’

And Pele, flashing a wide grin, stated that Lionel Messi’s one-footed nature and lack of aerial presence gives himself the edge when pundits compare the two: ‘I used to kick it with both feet. I never saw myself play, but I think I was the better player.’

The 74-year-old joked that he was a 'better player' than Lionel Messi because the Brazilian used both feet
