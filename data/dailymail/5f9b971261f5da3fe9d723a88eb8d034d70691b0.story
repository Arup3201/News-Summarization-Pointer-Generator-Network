Brotherly love was on show at Tadcaster Albion on Saturday as Manchester United treble winner Jonathan Greening made his debut for the non-league side in a 6-0 win, with his brother Josh grabbing a hat-trick.

The pair were pictured all smiles ahead of the clash, with Tadcaster posting the photo on their Twitter account with the caption 'Brothers in Arms...RT for the Greening Boys'.

Greening, who was a member of United's historic all-conquering squad during the 1998/99 season, joined the Yorkshire-based club on Thursday.

Following a four-season stint at Old Trafford, playing alongside the likes of Roy Keane, David Beckham and Ryan Giggs, the midfielder also had spells at Middlesbrough, West Bromwich Albion and Fulham, as well as Nottingham Forest and Barnsley. 

The 35-year-old had initially retired from football earlier this week after being on trial at League Two outfit Hartlepool. Greening also spent time at Championship side Blackpool earlier this summer. 

But he has since decided to extend his playing career by going further down the football pyramid and impressed on his debut for Albion before being replaced with 15 minutes to go.

However, it was brother Josh, 22, who would go on to take all the plaudits, as his impressive treble helped Tadcaster on their way to an easy win over Maltby Main.

As a result the hosts moved up to fourth in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division, which is five tiers below the Football League, with over 250 people in attendance to watch the game.
