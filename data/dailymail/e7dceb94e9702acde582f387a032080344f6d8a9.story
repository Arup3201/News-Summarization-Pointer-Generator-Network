An enterprising British schoolboy is tasting sweet success in the U.S. after appearing on the cover of children's Time magazine - thanks to his grandfather's fudge recipe.

Fraser Bawtree, 13, started making the fudge with the recipe handed down by his grandfather Nick to make a few pounds to pay for a school trip.

But his product was such a success with his family and friends he decided to set up his own firm at the age of eleven.

In his first year of trading Fraser had a turnover of £13,000 and this year - after taking on an adult marketing manager - is set to turn over £40,000.

His frasersfudj online shop is getting orders from fans in the U.S. as well as Japan and all over Europe.

The youngster became an overnight star after being chosen to cover American magazine Time For Kids, which has eight million readers.

Fraser, who lives with father Tim and mother Zoe, in Cheltenham, Glos., said: 'Being on the front cover of Time magazine for kids is a huge honour.

'Apparently it has eight million readers in the U.S. I'm very proud that I managed to achieve my goals. It has been a real boost to my confidence.

The recipe was given to Fraser by his grandfather (pictured with baby Fraser), retired physics teacher Nick, from Perth, Scotland, who died eight years ago aged 66

'I want to keep building my business, it has been a real experience moving from making fudge at home to having it made in a specialist factory.'

Fraser has struggled at school because he has dyslexia but is determined that will not hold back his business dreams.

He added: 'Being dyslexic, I find school work hard work, my cooking is a way of relaxing and working out all the costings and profit margins helps me with my maths too.

'People think that having dyslexia is a problem, but look at me now. One day I hope to have my own factory where I can make all sorts of Fudj products.

'I'm really pleased with how it has gone. I have always enjoyed cooking at home, especially sweet things like cookies, cakes and fudge.

'Mum helps me with the marketing but I do all the rest.'

Fraser has funded his first overseas fact-finding mission to Shanghai and has been invited by TV chef Jamie Oliver to exhibit at his upcoming Big Feastival.

Although he doesn't pay himself a wage - pouring all profits back into the business - he does allow himself the odd perk - like a new bike.

The talented youngster has branched out into making gift packages as well as different varieties including rum and raisin, popping candy and chocolate marshmallow.

His online shop has been so successful he has now moved production to a small factory.

Father Tim, 43, said the recipe was given to Fraser by his grandfather, retired physics teacher Nick, from Perth, Scotland, who died eight years ago aged 66.

Tim said: 'It's nice that it's a Scottish recipe because we are a Scottish family.

'The recipe that Fraser uses was given to him by his granddad when he was a small boy.

'In his spare time my dad loved baking and cooking and often taught Fraser how to make biscuits, jam and fudge.

From selling it at school it has taken on a life of its own and grown into a proper business.

'When we said he was going to have to earn some money for the school trip I thought it meant my car would get washed a few times.

'Unfortunately that hasn't happened. But he has allowed us to test some of the flavours, so I suppose I shouldn't complain.'
