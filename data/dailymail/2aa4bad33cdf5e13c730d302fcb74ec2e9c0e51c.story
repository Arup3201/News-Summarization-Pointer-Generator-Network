Victoria Beckham has certainly undergone an image change in the past few years but photographs of her latest collection will have fans wondering if she's taken her darker new look too far.

In new pictures of her Victoria, Victoria Beckham autumn/winter 2015 collection, a model poses in a bare room lying prone on the floor with her eyes closed, while in another she lies as though unconscious on a chair with  her head falling back behind her.

The shots  hark back to the controversial 'heroin chic' look of the early Nineties that launched Kate Moss.

In one picture from Victoria, Victoria Beckham's new AW15 images, one model seems to play dead

In another picture she lies stretched out uncomfortably on a waiting room-style chair as though unconscious

This may be a yoga pose but there's nothing fluid about this posture in a drab claustrophobic room by a handful of tulips dangling from the letter box and in front of an old fashioned television

The label describes the sister collection as: 'Free spirited and fun - key features are made of classic fabrics such as ginghams, tweeds and leathers, which are twisted and played with to create new and modern statements.'

Yet the pictures by top photographer Colin Dodgson look almost eerie, as a glum pale-faced beauty adopts a series of awkward poses in the beige, magnolia and pea soup-green room.

In a number of pictures the model stretches out on the floor, with her eyes closed, her feet splayed out as though she's pretending to be unconscious. 

In one shot, in which she wears a lilac leather mini dress, she performs an uncomfortable-looking yogic backward bend in front of an old television with yellow tulips - said to represent cheerfulness - dangling out of the letter box.

Another pose - again in front of the door - sees her adopting a listless forward slump.

The label describes the AW15 Victoria, Victoria Beckham line - aimed at younger customers than the mother-of-four's main label - as 'statement dressing made easy'.

Queen Victoria Beckham is the ruler of the runway nowadays. The singer-turned-fashion extraordinaire has been perfecting her craft over the last few seasons and her latest collection only cemented her credentials further.

Whilst her runway often features daring cuts and pops of bright color, like most in the fash pack, Victoria has a penchant for a darker palette when it comes to her personal style.

Here we have the woman herself showing us why top-to-toe black will always be the sleekest of looks as she steps out onto the catwalk following her fall 2012 show.

We love the simplicity of this look, the soft knit teamed with the sleek pleated midi skirt. Folded at the waist to create a delicate A-line shape, this skirt is a beautiful piece and the good news is that it's still available to buy at Net A Porter (right).

In one picture shot by top photographer Colin Dodgson, the model - wearing odd shoes - is confronted with a bunch of tulips being stuffed through the letter box of the pea soup-coloured door

She strikes a pose surrouned by old electrics and an industrial old fashioned white radiator

'Attitude is applied, stripped down and made sophisticated - creating a wearable collection that continues to evolve with its customer.'

Victoria, 40, has been moving in a more serious  direction since becoming a designer, adopting darker clothes and swapping her tight outfits and heels for dark midi-skirts and flats.

But the pictures showing off the clothes, which sees prices range from £225 to £1,250, seem to be her oddest style statement yet.

The company describes the AW15 Victoria, Victoria Beckham collection as embodying the 'independent spirit of the VVB girl. This individual attitude imbues a broad range of dresses and an increased offer of separates.'

Looking listless and weak, the model lies prone on the  carpet, just resting an outstretched arm on the wall

Focusing on dresses, the line includes wrap skirts, crop knits, skinny stretch trousers and voluminous peplum tops. 

'Fabrics are played with and re-interpreted in the inimitable VVB style - leopard print is applied to heavy crepes and blistered silks, checks are applied to angora and bonded with neoprene, gingham is weaved in to a cloque and crystal embroidery is individually shattered and then held together in delicate metallic cases,' the label says.

'Colours are vibrant and strong - shocking pink, electric blue and blood red are set against monochrome black and white - all adding to the strong yet still feminine silhouettes.'

California-born Dodgson, is described as capturing 'the vitality of youth and fashion with disarming frankness' on his website.

Which adds: 'His rendering of color and shrewd approach to urban, often minimal environments, produces surprising photographs of casual sophistication and sly humor.' 

The Victoria Beckham label told MailOnline: 'For the past four seasons we have invited a photographer to interpret the Victoria Victoria Beckham collection according to their own creative vision. 

'This season we worked with Colin Dodgson, who is known for his idiosyncratic style of photography, to shoot the AW15 collection within this series.'
