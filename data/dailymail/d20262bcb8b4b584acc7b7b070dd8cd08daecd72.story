When Maia Norman pulled into the driveway of a Hollywood hotel ten days ago after a 3,000-mile rally across America, onlookers might have expected her to be greeted by her long-time partner Damien Hirst, the father of her three children and the world’s richest artist.

Instead, the crowd of more than 150 journalists and car enthusiasts saw California-born Norman, 49, leap out of her black Dodge Charger – complete with Hirst’s skull design on the side – to passionately embrace debonair Tim Spicer, a former mercenary who is ten years her senior and has a controversial past.

Today, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Hirst, who has a £215 million fortune, has been left ‘devastated’ after Norman confessed the affair to him in the last week of May, before leaving for America to take part in Gumball 3000, an annual ‘supercar’ road race.

The 47-year-old artist and his partner of 19 years are understood to have broken the news of their split to friends and confidants.

It is unclear whether Norman will now move out of the couple’s main home, a 300-year-old Grade II listed farmhouse in Devon.

Ten days ago, she grinned as she greeted 59-year-old Spicer, a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Scots Guards who now runs Aegis Defence Services, a security firm that has won multi-million-pound contracts with the US government in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The pair kissed tenderly outside Hollywood’s landmark Roosevelt Hotel before Spicer helped to unload bags from Norman’s vehicle.

The scene was played out in front of photographers taking pictures of glamorous Norman and her three female team-mates, named ‘Team Mother of Pearl’ in honour of her London-based fashion firm.

She embraced her lover for a second time before the pair walked arm-in-arm into the hotel lobby.

One onlooker said: ‘They looked incredibly comfortable and happy to see each other. You got the feeling this was the real thing, not just a fling.’

When approached and asked whether she was leaving Hirst for Spicer, Norman confirmed ‘yes’ before declining to speak further. Twice-divorced Spicer, the father of a teenage son, remained silent.

A spokeswoman for Spicer later said: ‘He has no comment to make.’

One onlooker said: 'They looked incredibly comfortable and happy to see each other. You got the feeling this was the real thing, not just a fling.'

The end of Hirst’s relationship will shock the art world, where it was considered one of the most stable, despite the couple never marrying.

And Norman’s decision to replace Hirst with a one-time mercenary is certain to raise eyebrows further.

In interviews to promote her fashion line, Norman told how she met Hirst in 1993 when she was dating his friend, art dealer Jay Jopling.

Romance blossomed when she and Hirst bonded over their mutual lack of a father figure and humble beginnings – he in Leeds and she in Los Angeles. She said: ‘When I met Damien, he had a mattress on the floor of a rented room in a council block. We talked about art and books and he made me laugh.’

In the early days, she worked as his assistant, accompanying him to maggot farms and abattoirs to collect items he would incorporate into his art. Among his best-known works are a shark preserved in a tank of formaldehyde and a diamond-studded human skull that sold for £50 million.

Throughout the Nineties the pair led a hedonistic lifestyle, mingling with stars such as Elton John and Bono. Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt, a close friend, described Norman in her younger days as ‘absolute trouble in the best possible way’.

Talking about this period, Norman has admitted: ‘I punched him [Hirst] in the dark once. We were on mushrooms.’

Of their ‘quieter’ life post-children, she has said: ‘It’s complete role-reversal. He’s the cook and I’m the driver. He does cuddly stuff and I teach the boys to ride their quad bikes.’ They have three children aged 16, 12 and seven.

Regarding their decision never to marry, Norman has said: ‘We both come from divorced families, which doesn’t exactly boost your faith in the institution.’

Hirst’s love rival’s background is as colourful as the artist’s works. Spicer has been described as devastatingly charming and the ‘doyen of action men’.

At Sandhurst, he won the Sword of Honour in 1976 for most promising cadet. Throughout his Army career, and particularly in Northern Ireland when he commanded the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, he inspired great loyalty in his men. For his service in Ulster he was awarded the OBE.

Serving in the Falklands, he earned the nickname ‘Tumbledown Tim’ after narrowly avoiding an exploding shell on Mount Tumbledown.

After leaving the Army in 1994, he set up a military company, Sandline International, and came to public prominence in 1997 when he was paid £22.5 million by the government of Papua New Guinea to suppress a rebellion.

Arriving back in Britain, Spicer told how he was detained by a breakaway element of the country’s defence force and had a pistol put to his head several times.

A year later he hit the headlines again during the arms-to-Africa scandal. Spicer was accused of shipping weapons to Sierra Leone in breach of a UN embargo. It led to his London home and the offices of Sandline – which  he set up with fellow mercenary Simon Mann – being raided by Customs & Excise.

Spicer has said: ‘I was doing something that I believed, both publicly and privately, to be in the public interest and I had had extensive discussions with government representatives.

‘You can imagine that it was pretty irritating to be treated like a criminal.’ 

He always denied that he or Sandline did anything illegal. Sherborne-educated Spicer, who has a son by his second wife, Caroline, chronicled his exploits in a book, An Unorthodox Soldier: Peace And War And The Sandline Affair.

When it was published, he said: ‘We can help stop the killing in Sierra Leone and Rwanda when nobody else is prepared to do it for political or logistical reasons. But, of course, we are also a private commercial organisation, so we do expect to get paid for putting ourselves in harm’s way.’

His post-Army career has made him wealthy beyond his wildest dreams and he enjoys the spoils of success: fine wine, fat cigars, shooting in Scotland. ‘I’m not a danger junkie,’ he once said. ‘I like doing active things, but I’m equally at home pottering about in an art gallery.’

In 1999, Spicer left Sandline and three years later set up his current military company, Aegis Defence Services. After the Iraq war, Aegis won a £153 million US government contract to help secure the country and protect aid workers and officials. However, a Pentagon audit found that it had failed to  provide adequate weapons training or properly vet guards.

A 2007 article in Vanity Fair dubbed him ‘Iraq’s Mercenary King’. Further contracts in Afghanistan and elsewhere have taken the firm’s earnings from the US government to £275 million.

While her new boyfriend is rich, Norman is potentially walking away from a vast property portfolio. It includes the £3.5 million farmhouse in Combe Martin, North Devon, set in 24 acres; a houseboat in Chelsea; a house in Thailand; and a beach home in Mexico.

Then there is Toddington Manor, a magnificent 19th Century Grade I listed 300-room country pile in Gloucestershire. It has been under renovation since Hirst bought it in 2005 and it is where he intends to  display his private art collection, including works by Francis Bacon, Jeff Koons and Andy Warhol.

It is unknown how Spicer came into Hirst’s orbit but neighbours in Devon have speculated he could have helped to arrange the security guards who monitor the entrance to Hirst’s home.

One resident who has met Hirst socially said: ‘He pays top dollar and that buys loyalty. He treats his  people well but if they breathe one word about any aspect of his life then they know it’s potentially a sackable offence. He’s a hands-on father. He cooks the kids’ meals, takes them to the beach. I can always tell when he’s home because I spot his helicopter coming in to land.’

Friends of Hirst say he has accepted that his partner’s relationship with Spicer is serious and, while devastated, he is determined to maintain cordial relations.  A source said: ‘The welfare of the children is their main priority.’

In a recent interview to promote a current retrospective of his work at London’s Tate Modern, Hirst said: ‘When you are young, you’re invincible, you’re immortal, or at least you think you are.’ He added: ‘I’m getting older. I’m not the mad bastard shouting at the world any more.’

Sadly, it is a world that he is now facing alone.
