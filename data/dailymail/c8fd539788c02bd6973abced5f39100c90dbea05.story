Pressure: A new report had said that the 111 helpline is increasing pressure on healthcare services

The NHS 111 helpline could be putting even more pressure on A&E units - despite being set up to reduce the number of patients turning up at casualty, research has shown.

A government-commissioned study found that in some areas the helpline led to an extra 400 patients and an additional 600 ambulance call-outs every month.

Research by academics at the University of Sheffield, published in the British Medical Journal, looked at four areas where the helpline was introduced in 2011 and compared the number of patients going to A&E and ambulance call-outs a year later.

They found in Nottingham, it led to an extra 400 patients showing up in A&E every month – an increase of 6 per cent – while there was a 5 per cent rise in Luton, which worked out as an additional 200 patients a month.

The study also found that in Durham and Darlington nearly 1,000 extra patients turned up in urgent care centres every month, an increase of 8 per cent compared to the previous year.

And in Nottingham the centres, which are usually located within normal A&E units, treated 900 extra people a month.

The introduction of the helpline also led to an increase in 999 call-outs of between 6 and 11 per cent in all the areas being looked at – in Lincolnshire this worked out as 650 more a month.

NHS 111 was rolled out this spring to give patients round-the-clock medical advice over the phone.

The Government launched the helpline to replace GP out-of-hours numbers and the NHS Direct helpline.

But the study concluded that in its first year, NHS 111 ‘did not deliver the expected system benefits of reducing calls to the 999 ambulance service or shifting patients to urgent rather than emergency care’.

It is manned by call centre workers with just six weeks' training - who according to experts have been sending patients to A&E and calling out ambulances unnecessarily.

Concerns have also been raised that patients who are not put through to a doctor or nurse hang up in frustration and end up going to casualty anyway.

But the Department of Health said the study did not reflect how the helpline is now performing because it only looked at a few areas that had been involved in the pilot.

And yesterday the NHS’s top doctor insisted that the helpline would be a solution to the crisis in A&E, saying it would let patients speak to doctors and nurses rather than going to their nearest casualty.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, said he intends to beef-up the NHS 111 helpline by hiring more doctors and nurses.

He also announced a major shake-up of A&E departments, introducing the idea of a two-tier system.

This would see about half of A&Es dealing with heart attacks, strokes and serious injuries with the remainder treating less critical patients.

The plans will also see GPs offering more same-day appointments and opening their surgeries at evenings and weekends to reduce the need for patients to go to A&E.

But the idea has already run into controversy, with critics saying the new system will only end up confusing patients.

Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘2013 has been the worst year in a decade in A&E. It is a crisis of David Cameron’s own making.

‘It is clear that his decision to scrap NHS Direct and replace nurses with call handlers has added to the pressure on A&E.’
