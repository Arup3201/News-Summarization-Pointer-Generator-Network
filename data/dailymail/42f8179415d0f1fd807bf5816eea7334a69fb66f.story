A cattle ship abandoned by its crew off Italy with 450 migrants yesterday – many of them women and children - has been docked in Italy. 

Earlier, rescuers boarded the Ezadeen - a 50 year old ship designed to transport cattle - after a passenger raised the alarm as it drifted in the Mediterranean. 

The Sierra Leone-flagged, 240ft livestock carrier was found drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the southern Italian coast.

It had been put on a collision course for the Italian coast but ran out of fuel, officials said.

Italian coast guard officials, lowered by helicopter onto the bridge, took control of the ship, which was on automatic pilot.

Italy's coastguard tweeted to say the ship had arrived in to port shortly before 10pm GMT. 

The coastguard commander in Corigliano Calabro, Francesco Perrotti, told the BBC all the migrants on board were from Syria.

He said they were being taken by bus to other parts of Italy. He described the migrants' physical condition as relatively good after their three-day ordeal.

It is believed to have set sail from Turkey, although earlier reports suggest it was from Cyprus. It is thought the migrants were victims of smugglers using an alternative route to the usual one from Libya.

It came just 48 hours after six officials were dropped on to the deck of another ship, the Blue Sky M, packed with nearly 1,000 Syrians and Kurdish migrants that had been 'locked' on a crash course with the Italian coast.   

Italian coastguards brought it under control and safely docked it at the Italian port of Gallipoli on Wednesday.

Authorities believe the traffickers have adopted 'a policy' of packing old, barely seaworthy vessels with desperate migrants and leaving them to their fate by abandoning ship during the journey.

The ships – with their human cargo often cramped on deck in bitter cold and with few supplies – are fixed on a 'crash course' with the Italian coastline, their engines locked or simply allowed to drift towards land.

Last year, it is estimated nearly 3,500 refugees died trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe, while another 200,000 were rescued.  

The war in Syria has meant the numbers fleeing for Europe have risen dramatically, overtaking the numbers of Afghans, Eritreans, Tunisians and other nationalities seeking a new start.
