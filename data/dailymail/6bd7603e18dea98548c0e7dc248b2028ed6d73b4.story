Mitt Romney's world tour took another embarrassing turn on Tuesday when a top aide told reporters at a Polish holy site to 'kiss my a**' and 'shove it' when they shouted questions at the Republican presidential candidate.

Rick Gorka, Romney's traveling press secretary, flew off the handle at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw and was forced to apologize -- marking the third-straight country where sideshow remarks have distracted from intent of the resume-boosting international trip.

In London last week, Romney was jeered by politicians and booed by crowds after he suggested the city wasn't ready to for the Olympic Games.

Paying respect: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney visited the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, Poland, on Tuesday in the final leg of his world tour

Lashing out: Press secretary Rick Gorka was forced to apologize after telling reporters to 'kiss my a**'

He drew criticism and accusations of racism in Jerusalem on Monday when he said Israel's economic superiority to the Palestinian territories was a matter of 'culture.'

His campaign has vehemently denied those allegations.

Mr Gorka's remarks came hours before a major foreign policy speech in the Polish capital in which Romney praised the central European nation for becoming what he said was a model of small government and free enterprise.

The former Massachusetts governor
 said that 'rather than heeding the false promise of a 
government-dominated economy, Poland sought to stimulate innovation, 
attract investment, expand trade and live within its means' after the 
Communist era.

'The world should pay close attention to the transformation of Poland’s economy,' Romney said.

'A march toward economic liberty and smaller government has meant a march toward higher living standards, a strong military that defends liberty at home and abroad, and an important and growing role on the international stage.'

Mr Gorka's angry words to reporters were made Tuesday morning when Romney visited a monument to Poland's war dead with the Warsaw mayor.

Reporters began shouting questions at the presumptive Republican nominee from behind a rope line because, they said, he has answered only three queries from the traveling press corps.

A CNN reporter shouted: 'Gov Romney are you concerned about some of the mishaps of your trip?'

'Gov Romney do you have a statement for the Palestinians?' a New York Times reporter asked'What about your gaffes?' chimed in a Washington Post writer.

'Governor Romney do you feel that your gaffes have overshadowed your foreign trip?' asked the Times journalist.

Praise: Romney said Poland was a model for small government and free enterprise during a foreign policy speech at the University of Warsaw Library

'Governor Romney just a few 
questions sir, you haven't taken but three questions on this trip from 
the press!' the CNN reporter protested.

That's when Mr Gorka stepped in: 'Show some respect,' he told the American journalists.

When a New York Times reporter said he was trying to get answers to his question, Gorka responded harshly.

'Kiss my a**. This is a Holy site for the Polish people. Show some respect,' he said.

Going home: The foreign policy speech was on the last events of Romney's world tour. He returns home on Wednesday

Later, he told a Politico reporter to 'shove it.'

About 30 minutes later, the spokesman called reporters and apologized.

However, it's likely that for all the media bluster, Romney's 'gaffes' on his foreign trip will effectively zero impact on his chances in the November election.

A poll in May found that only one percent of voters said foreign policy was the most important issue in the race. 

The foreign trip also garnered front page coverage in several newspapers in the swing states of Florida, Nevada and Ohio -- with on-message stories about his support for Israel, not articles about his slip-ups.
