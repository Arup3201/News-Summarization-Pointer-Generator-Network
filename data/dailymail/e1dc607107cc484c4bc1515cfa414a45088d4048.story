They say you should never rock the boat. 

But passengers on a wind-swept ferry gave their ferry journey a fun injection, by throwing an impromptu ceilidh.

The normally quiet car deck was transformed into a wild scene of dancing and music on a journey between two islands on Shetland.

Passengers travelling from the island of Yell to the larger Shetland town of Lerwick threw the expected party

A group of musicians returning from a festival provided the music and travellers joined in one-by-one.

A full ceilidh band, including a fiddle player, guitarist and accordion, were returning the Shetland Folk Festival on the island of Yell to the main town of Lerwick.

Unlikely party venue: The car deck of the MV Daglien became the setting for an impromptu dance off

The ceilidh apparently started on the band's bus and transferred to the car deck for the entire 30-minute crossing.

Musician Adam Holmes, 23, from Edinburgh, said: 'We were on the bus and Saltfish Forty started playing a version of Highway to Hell, called Highway to Yell.

'There was quite a lot of drinking involved. It was just pretty mental.

'There was quite a lot of drinking involved,' one passenger said of the spontaneous dance party on the boat

'It was quite magical. It felt like the Titanic before it went bad... It was quite beautiful - one of those special moments.'

Ian Pearson, assistant marine superintendent at Shetland Isles Council, said: 'It's very entertaining. It kind of happens from time to time with travelling musicians or the folk festival.

No safety issues: Dancing on the car deck is perfectly safe, according to a memberShetland Isles Council

'It was quite beautiful - one of those special moments,' said Adam Holmes, 23, who was on board the ferry

'There are no safety concerns for dancing on the car deck - you can get out of your car on these ferries. It's usually done on a fine summer's night so the ferry doesn't move much.

'One time I was a crew member on a ferry and a Russian band started playing. Of course, they all started Cossack dancing.'
