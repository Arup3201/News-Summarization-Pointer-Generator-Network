These pictures capture the adorable moment a baby seal lies laughing on a sandy island.

With his mouth wide open and eyes squeezed shut this cute pup looks like he's having a big belly laugh at his remote island home.

The hilarious shots were captured at Dune, part of the German Heligoland Islands in the Northern Sea, by photographer Peter Krejzl.

What's so funny? A baby seal laughs hysterically while lying on its side on a sandy beach in the northern sea

Hysterics: Photographer Peter Krejzl took the series of adorable photographs on the remote location

The 35-year-old from the Czech Republic visited the island specially to see the seal pups who make it their home.

Peter Krejzl said: 'I took these photos on a very windy little island with a large population of seals.

'The island is about 65 kilometers away from the coast, so the most common way how to get there is by a ship.

'The small island was damaged significantly by the weather, the airport was covered by the sand and the seals were relaxing on the runway.

Giggling: The adorable pup holds its tummy as it continues to laugh heartily with its eyes closed

And relax: The pup calms itself down and holds itself with its fluffy white flippers

'The pups play with anything they find and follow people that come to Dune to see them.

'It looked like they were smiling, playing and laughing.

'Hurricane Xaver has meant there are not as many seal calfs on the island as in previous years.'

Sight: The photographer said the group of seals were looked as though they were smiling and playing
