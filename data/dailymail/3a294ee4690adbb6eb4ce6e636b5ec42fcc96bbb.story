A Ugandan maid who sparked outrage when she was filmed stomping on a toddler has been jailed for four years.

Jolly Tumuhirwe, 22, was filmed beating and kicking 18-month-old Aneela Kamanzi after she vomited while eating dinner.

Horrifying footage, caught on a hidden camera by the girl's father, showed Tumuhirwe attacking the child who had been left in her care.

The assault happened after the child, seen being shoved off the couch in her family home in Uganda, was sick while being fed a meal by her nanny Jolly Tumuhirwe

Sentencing Tumuhirwe, Chief Magistrate Lillian Buchan said the nanny had committed an 'unjustifiable and inexcusable' crime.

She said the four-year sentence reflected the 'ruthlessness exhibited' on an 'innocent, helpless child'.

Tumuhirwe was caught attacking the child when her father, Eric Kamanzi, noticed that his daughter was bruised and limping.

Instead of confronting the maid, Mr Kamanzi installed cameras in the family home in Nakawa, watching in horror as he reviewed the footage. 

The sickening video shows Tumuhirwe dragging the child onto the floor before beating her with a torch, and then kicking and standing on the toddler. 

Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Kamanzi said: 'It's not for us to decide the punishment for what she committed.

'We hope this has set an example for other maids out there, that you can't just go to someone's house and torture their baby and expect to walk out.'

Rose Zimulinda, a relative of the girl, said the child was physically but may suffer from long-term psychological problems.

The distressing video of the child being beaten caused outrage when it was posted online in Uganda, and has since been shared thousands of times on social media. 

Mr Kamanzi is reported to have beaten Tumuhirwe, who had been working for the family for three months at the time, 'to a pulp' after watching the video.

The nanny later reported the assault to police and Mr Kamanzi was arrested after admitting he had attacked her.

But after showing police the security tapes of the assault on Aneela, the charges against the father, who works for an NGO in Kampala, were dropped.
