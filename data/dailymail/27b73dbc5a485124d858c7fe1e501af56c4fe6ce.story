A couple were told their monthly electricity payments would be increasing from £87 to £53.5million after a computer error led to a power company sending them a £500million bill.

Grandparents Nigel and Linda Brotherton were told by energy suppliers npower that they had run up the huge bill - and if they did not pay it off their monthly direct debit would rise to £53.5million.

The problem arose when the couple's previous supplier, Scottish Power, installed a new meter at their 16th century home in the village of Roughlee, near Burnley, Lancashire.

Ouch! Grandparents Nigel and Linda Brotherton 
were told by energy suppliers npower that their monthly direct debit payments would be rising to
 £53.5millionfrom August 5 this year

Error: Grandparents Nigel and Linda Brotherton were told by energy suppliers npower (pictured) they had run up a £500m bill

Their electrician connected one of the wires the wrong way round, so 
that instead of recording the number or units used it didn’t register 
any and continued showing zero.

Mr Brotherton, 62, and his wife, 59, did not notice the problem as they paid their bill by direct 
debit each month and were never asked to give a reading.

However, after they switched suppliers to npower in May, a workman was sent round to read their meter.

When
 he entered a reading of 'zero', npower’s computer wrongly assumed the 
dials must have gone all round the clock - and automatically flagged up 
the huge bill.

The Brothertons were told they didn’t need to do anything because the money would be taken automatically from their bank.

But
 accountant Mr Brotherton said: 'There was just one problem with that - I 
didn’t quite have £53million in my current account at the time.'

Cause: The problem came after Scottish Power, which has its headquarters (pictured) in Glasgow, installed a new meter at the couple's home - but it was wired incorrectly

Bizarrely, the online bill also showed that the couple had actually overpaid and were in credit by £1,362.69.

Despite repeated phone calls to npower, and contacting the regulator Ofgen, the couple are still waiting for a refund and written confirmation they won’t have to fork out the £53,480,062.00 a month.

'It’s a good job they didn’t actually try to take all that money from my bank account,' Mr Brotherton said.

'Not only would it have gone way over my overdraft limit, but it could have brought down the bank and sparked another global financial crisis.

'The electricity board have admitted it is a mistake and told us we don’t need to pay the money but we are still waiting for the refund they owe us.'

Alice Nutter, one of the notorious Pendle witches who was hanged 400 years ago, is reputed to have once lived in the couple’s historic cottage.

'Perhaps she put a curse on the meter,' joked Mr Brotherton.

'But if the electricity board doesn’t sort this out quick I’ll get her to put a curse on them and turn all their bosses into toads.'

A spokesman for npower apologised yesterday and said: 'This was clearly a mistake.

'Mr Brotherton’s meter was incorrectly wired by his previous supplier and not npower, which had a knock-on effect to how we billed the account.

'His payments are set at £87, so no extra money will be taken and we have processed a refund which should be with Mr Brotherton on Tuesday.'

A spokesman from Scottish Power told MailOnline he was looking into the incident.
