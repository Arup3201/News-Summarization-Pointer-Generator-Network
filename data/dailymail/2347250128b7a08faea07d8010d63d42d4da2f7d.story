A celebrity psychic who was a confidante of Michael Jackson has died after apparently predicting her own death.

Jillian Lane moved from Wales to Los Angeles to become a clairvoyant to the stars, most famously holding consultations with Jackson when he was the world's biggest pop star.

But she has now died from liver disease, after telling friends she knew that her death was imminent when she was first taken ill.

Ominous: Ms Lane apparently predicted that she would die after falling ill earlier this year

Ms Lane, 53, met Jackson when he was performing in London in 1997 and phoned a psychic helpline looking for insight into his future.

She gained the trust of the singer, and he began flying her from Britain to Beverly Hills for private consultations.

After the psychic settled in Los Angeles permanently, she claimed to be the number one celebrity clairvoyant in the star-studded city.

Earlier this year she fell ill with liver disease - and she claimed to know that she would not survive the illness.

After six weeks in an LA hospital, she asked to be flown home to Britain, and died at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

'It is tragic,' said close friend Suzanne Yessayan. 'She had predicted her own passing and on this occasion, I hoped her prediction was wrong.

'She was a very giving, caring person. She kept her mind open and her heart open. She had style, grace and charm.

'Working with Michael Jackson was her crowning glory.'

In an interview shortly after Jackson's death, Ms Lane revealed details of her sessions with the star.'He'd just sit there telling me just how stressed out he was,' she said.

'Michael was a very sensitive guy and would hate what was usually written about him, especially around the time of his trial for child abuse in 2005.

'The last time we met was sitting in my white Mercedes pouring his heart out, it was very sad. I really felt for him.

'The one thing he seemed to lack was the one thing money couldn't buy - genuine friendship.

'There are a lot of people out there who constantly tried to extort money off Michael, so much so he had to watch whose company he kept.

'I was never financially reimbursed for providing him with any of my services. He'd buy me plenty of gifts though - one time it was a beautiful diamond ring, the next time he'd send a huge bunch of flowers.'

Ms Lane claimed to have a number of spirit guides, including a Scottish medic called Dr Mackintosh who apparently gave her healing powers.

Her funeral is taking place today in her hometown of Barry, South Wales, with Dr Yessayan reading the eulogy.
