Read the Barcelona 2-1 Manchester City match report here

Some things are a bit different at Barcelona these days. Others, like Lionel Messi stay exactly the same.

‘How have you gone from the Disney house to the haunted house?’ was one of the more imaginative questions asked of Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano at the club’s training ground on Tuesday.

Mascherano didn’t really have much of an answer to that one. To be fair to him, he probably didn’t really understand it.

Still here: Some things never change... like Lionel Messi's class

He will lead us to glory: Barcelona and Argentina team-mate Javier Mascherano sung his praises on Tuesday

He did, however, have something to say when asked to pick up on another popular narrative of the times in Catalonia, namely the supposed decline of Lionel Messi. That’s Messi of almost a goal a game for club and country this season, by the way.

‘Leo is a leader,’ he said. ‘He is trying to make us achieve in as many competitions as possible. With him, we can do it.’

What else would Mascherano say? He is hardly likely to sit there and suggest that Messi should be  bundled on to the next plane to  Buenos Aires.

Nevertheless, just as it is ridiculous to expect one footballer to criticise another in such a public forum, so it is to suggest that Messi’s time at the Nou Camp may be short.

Certainly the explosive, astonishing episodes that illuminated Messi’s season in La Liga last time round have been thinner on the ground this time. Just as Barcelona have at times lacked a little sparkle, so has he.

No 1: Messi was back to his brilliant best on Wednesday night, tormenting Manchester City from start to finish

New star: He has had to share the limelight with Neymar, but the pair dovetailed magnificently at the Nou Camp

Delight: Messi dinks the ball over Joe Hart in the Manchester City goal

Not quite: Hart could do nothing to stop the beautifully executed chip

Lionel Messi has overtaken Raul as the top Champions League scorer with a single club...

1 Messi 67

2 Raul 66

3 Cristiano Ronaldo 46

(Raul scored five goals with Schalke so is still top overall)

Maybe it is the passing of time that is to blame. That is unlikely, though. The four-time winner of the Ballon D’Or is only 26. More likely it has been the presence of a new forward partner, the Brazilian Neymar.

Whatever the case, there was little sign of personal decline here on Wednesday night. Barcelona could have been three goals up in half-an-hour or so and Messi was at the heart of most of what was dangerous about Gerardo Martino’s team.

The tackle and foul he drew from Joleon Lescott in the opening stages was typical. Show the opponent the ball and then make it disappear as the challenge arrives. The Manchester City defender fouled Messi and should have been punished with a penalty but the referee didn’t see it.

That’s always been the problem with Messi. He sucks defenders into making challenges that seem like a good idea at the time. More often than not, though, flailing legs find only fresh air — or his ankles.

Too quick: He ought to have had a penalty when Joleon Lescott brought him down in the box early on

Despair: A tackle often seems like a good idea at the time...

On a night when City spent long periods looking comfortable, they looked distinctly less so whenever Messi had the ball. Twice he played in Neymar for good opportunities in the first half, while Xavi should have scored when his team-mate slipped an exquisite ball through to him.

In the second half, one of Messi’s familiar lateral forays — it’s simply too dangerous to tackle him once he reaches the penalty area — saw him strike the inside of the post. In that particular instance he looked as  dangerous as ever.

The beauty of his football, and of Barcelona’s, has always been in its simplicity. When the Spanish champions play at their best it is like watching a five-a-side team.

When Barca did click last night this is how they did it. Messi’s goal, when it eventually came, arrived on the back of a mistake from Lescott but his execution was clinical.

Torment: Messi gave Lescott and Vincent Kompany a torrid evening, running at them and assisting others

Much love: Barca and Messi were at their best when they kept it simple, it was like watching a 5-a-side team

Support: The fans adore the Argentine, and it's little wonder why after displays like this

City, for their part, can count themselves fortunate and unfortunate all at the same time. Certainly they should have been at least one goal down early on. Messi should have had his penalty while Neymar’s early ‘goal’ was disallowed for an offside that only the officials saw.

However, there were also periods  that saw the Barclays Premier League team worry Barcelona. Unlike the first leg at the Etihad Stadium when City could only unsettle Barcelona on the break, they saw enough of the ball last night to create opportunities at their own pace.

Before the game, City’s Vincent Kompany suggested that one goal could ‘change the dynamic’. That goal almost arrived when substitute Edin Dzeko twice worried Victor Valdes early in the second half.

Ultimately, despite the sides grabbing a goal apiece just before the end, the superior team prevailed, as we always thought they would. Barcelona and Messi are not ready to drift into obscurity just yet.
