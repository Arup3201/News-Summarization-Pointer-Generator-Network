Despite facing arguably the strongest team in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying game, England can take statistical respite from the fact they are playing Switzerland on a Monday.

It may be the hardest day of the week for many of us to wake up, but England have an impressive win percentage of 67.3 per cent from games played on a Monday.

The Three Lions have only played nine Monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence.

Happy Mondays: England have won 37 of 55 games (67.3%) they have played on a Monday

Let it begin: England players train in Basle ahead of their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland

Staying power: Jack Wilshere is one of only two players who started the last game against the Swiss in 2011

Between 1880 and 1927, England played Wales alone 33 times on a Monday, which may have influenced statistics that sees them having won 37 of 55 games played while drawing 11 and losing seven.

England's game on Monday is a consequence of UEFA spreading out qualification matches as part of their new 'Week of Football' concept, with games taking place from Thursday to Tuesday.

That means that 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per ent during 2012 qualifying.

The final set of fixtures in each group, scheduled for October 2015 - will still kick-off simultaneously.

Meanwhile, here are all the other facts and figures on games between Switzerland and England ahead of a meeting that will help determine where we finish in our group...

Sick note: England will be without Daniel Sturridge after the striker picked up a knock in training

Spot on: Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring a penalty in the international friendly against Norway

63.6% - England’s win percentage against Switzerland. They have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. They are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the Swiss.

1 - Good news for Roy Hodgson — England have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home.

192 - Some bad news for Hodgson. In 192 minutes of football, England have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot.

3 - Wayne Rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. The England captain has scored in each of his three appearances against Switzerland.

2 - Only two players have survived from England’s last game against the Swiss — Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere both started that match at Wembley in 2011.

17 - England like playing in Basel. They have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. That includes an 8-1 victory in 1963.

9 - Switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. Their last defeat on home soil came against Romania in May 2012.
