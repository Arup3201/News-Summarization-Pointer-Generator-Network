Coronation Street star Michelle Keegan has been named the best bare faced celebrity, beating off stiff competition from love rival Lucy Mecklenburgh.

A new survey, which asked respondents which celebrity women remained flawless even after the make-up remover had come out, found that Michelle snatched victory from the hands of TOWIE star Lucy by two per cent.

Michelle, 26, received 23 per cent of votes, whilst 21-year-old Lucy gained 21 per cent.

Geordie girl Cheryl Cole, known for her naturally stunning smile and famous dimples, got the third place, with 15 per cent of respondents choosing her as the best bare-faced celebrity.

Global superstar, mother and doting wife Beyoncé was next in the poll after receiving 11 per cent of votes for her natural facial features.

Actress Jennifer Aniston, who first found fame in American sitcom Friends during the 90s, came fifth with nine per cent of respondents choosing her au natural look as the most flattering.

Made in Chelsea star Lucy Watson, who often embraces the make-up free look, came next in the poll after receiving eight per cent of votes.

She’s rarely seen without a face full of make-up, however Kim Kardashian’s fresh faced look impressed six per cent of respondents, putting her in seventh position.

Bajan beauty Rihanna, famous for her ever changing hair and make-up, gained four per cent of votes.

Pouting ex-Corrie star Helen Flanagan, known for her unashamed vanity, received two per cent of votes.

One respondent said: 'I saw a picture of Michelle Keegan without make-up and she looked stunning.

'To be honest I actually think she looks better without it, she was dressed down in a jumper and joggers but she still looked amazing.'

Another woman said: 'I think Jennifer Aniston is absolutely flawless without make up, she has hardly aged since being in Friends and if I look that good at 44 then I definitely won’t be complaining.'

A spokesperson for PromotionalCodes.org.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'All the women voted for in the top ten are beautiful without make up and absolutely deserve to be there.

'It’s nice to see celebrities looking natural now and then just so we can remind ourselves they are actually human too, it’s also a great thing for the younger generation to see so they can understand make-up isn’t always necessary.'

First, there was the selfie.Then, just as we all learned how to keep outstretched arms out of the shot, the healthie - where celebrities shared snaps of themselves exercising - became the latest slightly smug trend favoured by the famous.

Now comes the turn of the barefaced selfie, with stars from Rihanna to Kerry Katona and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley choosing to broadcast what they look like without their slap.

However, while some of them genuinely look like us post-workout or early in the morning (thank you Fern Britton), the majority of those choosing to post bare-faced snaps just seem to be, well, showing off.

Taken with soft lighting and a kind filter, the bare-faced selfie generally involves a wide-eyed expression - and usually makes clear somewhere that the subject is make-up free, just in case you missed it.

Holly Willoughby caused something of a media storm when she posted a picture of herself with no slap on last year – with many saying that the perfect image she projected put unfair pressure on normal women.

The Mail’s own Liz Jones weighed in saying: ‘Not admitting all the effort that goes into looking so radiant and ‘bare-faced’, not showing us the join, as it were, is tantamount to denying you have had a facelift, wear Spanx, or have a personal trainer.

‘We all need help, don’t we? To deny this is to denounce womanhood itself. It is arrogant, over-confident one-upmanship.’

However, the negative reaction has done little to stem the tide of barefaced selfies and it is hard to find a celebrity nowadays who hasn't posted one to prove their good looks remain once cosmetics have been stripped away.

These celebrities have either won the genetic lottery or employed the softest of lighting - but a few have actually had the courage to post pictures where they look less than perfect.

Fern Britton, Kerry Katona and Fearne Cotton have all bravely shared their red blotches, dark circles and un-perfect pores with us, to prove that you can still be beautiful - even with your flaws on display to the world.
