Clearly inspired by Jesus' words 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you', a pair of Christian mixed martial artists knock each other out with simultaneous blows to their privates.

Filmed for the now released 'Fight Church' documentary, the two fighters are part of the burgeoning Christian mixed martial arts movement that espouses the mantra, 'Jesus never quit, he never tapped out.'

Indeed, the documentary, which was funded by $30,000 raised through crowd sourcing, attempts to answer the hard questions raised by combining religion and extreme physical violence, such as, 'Can you love your neighbor as yourself and at the same time knee him in the face as hard as you can?'

Introducing themselves before the fight, one of the two men who knock each other expresses his desire to get closer to God during the brutal battle.

'The hope is that through the fight I can create a relationship with person I am fighting and Christ too,' says the fighter.

'If I win the fight its because God gave me that fight, it's not anything I have done.'

'Its already been decided who won. It's just you wait to find our what happens'

After the unfortunate result, the fighter sits in the dressing room with a bag of ice cooling over his now battered privates.

His pastor and leading light in the evangelical mixed martial arts world, Paul Burress, blesses him.

'Dear God thank you for the win. Thank you for making (the fighter) him ok and still walking,' says Burress.

'I pray there is no damage, nothing swells up badly here (his testicles) and God I just thank you for the safety out there. Amen.'

Focusing on Senior Pastor Paul Burress and his Rochester, New York, Trinity Church and its offshoot MMA school, Trinity Training, 'Fight Church' explores the contradictions inherent in fighting and organised Christianity.

'In life there are times when you take shots cause its a battle out there and the enemy is trying to seek and destroy us,' explained Burress to his congregation in a scene from 'Fight Church'.

'He wants to destroy your families, he wants to destroy you personally.

'That's where the bible gives you your training.

'I love fighting.'

Directed by Oscar winning short film-maker, Daniel Junge, 'Fight Church' travels the country to interview religious MMA figures.

'People may say, mixed martial arts is wrong, Jesus told everybody to turn the other cheek,' says 'Fight Pastor' Brandon Beals to the camera.

'I would be really quick to say, 'This is probably not the church for you!

'The greatest example is in scripture where Jesus was a fighter.

'That is the type of Jesus that I want to serve.'

Two evangelical Christians pummel each other in a caged ring at a Mixed Martial Arts fight encouraged by church goers

Mixing violent language with religious talk, the pastors in the documentary are unequivocal in their beliefs.

'There are definitely a lot of people who think there is a contradiction between fighting and Christianity,' explains Scott Sullivan, who studies theology and owns a MMA gym in Houston, Texas.

'This is two participants entering into a ring or a cage saying, we're gonna test each other today and the best man's gonna win.'

Mixed Martial Arts in illegal in New York State and the film explores the conflict between Burress and the state legislature in Albany.

'Personally I would prefer to have a full MMA competition here at the church, but that is not legal in the state of New York,' explains Burress

Appalled at his lobbbying for MMA licenses at his church, a state official articulates his opposition.

'It befuddles me why somebody, especially a minister would try to take this to the next level of violence,' says the official.

In an indication that 'Fight Church' intends to pull no punches, children are seen involving themselves in the fighting.

'I' am gonna go in there and rip this kids head off,' says one particularly enthusiastic MMA child fighter.

Mixed Martial Arts is the fastest growing sport in the United States

Sadly though, one of the brave children comes off worst in a MMA fight with a smaller kid and can't help but cry.

For the filmakers, the mixing of violence and religion is fascinating.

'On the surface, many find the two as incongruent,' said Daniel Junge to Loveland Magazine.

'And I think it’s very topical and a popular subject matter as we live in an overtly Christian nation and MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) is the fastest rising sport.

'The overlap between those makes a really interesting subculture to observe.

'There are many in the film giving interpretations of the Bible.

'But one thing you can say emphatically and without question, is that, nowhere does it outlaw Mixed Martial Arts.

'Therefore religion is such that everyone has their own interpretation; sometimes a very passionate interpretation of whether or not it encompasses their lifestyle.

'The people who inhabit this lifestyle, fight and are devout Christians believe that they are no contradictions there.

For the fighters themselves, the competition is religious in itself.

'The hope is that through the fight I can create a relationship with the person I'm fighting and extend Christ to him,' says one dedicated fighter.
