Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has said he will allow Yaya Toure to play through his difficult period rather than take him out of the firing line on compassionate grounds.

Pellegrini, who will be without captain Vincent Kompany at QPR on Saturday, has been talking to the troubled midfielder on a daily basis to help Toure rediscover the form that helped City win last season’s Premier League.

Toure is mourning the loss of his younger brother Ibrahim to cancer and has had to put up with racial abuse on social media. He lost his head in City’s 2-1 Champions League defeat to CSKA Moscow on Wednesday and was sent off for shoving Roman Eremenko in the face.

Manuel Pellegrini says Yaya Toure will not be sold by Manchester City despite inconsistent displays this year

Pellegrini said Toure is considered a 'very important player' and the club has never thought of selling him

But Pellegrini says neither he nor Toure think a break is needed to recharge the player’s batteries.

‘If I thought Yaya needed to mentally rest from the pressure, he is not the player I think he is,’ said Pellegrini.

‘He has all my support. He made a mistake in the second half against CSKA but not everything that happens at Manchester City is because of one player.

‘Yaya is a very important player. He will continue to (be picked) because that is the best way.

‘I talk to him every day and know he wants to continue playing.’

The City boss also dismissed reports that Toure will leave the club, despite there being no negotiations planned for a new contract.

‘Never in my mind or anyone at the club have we thought about selling Yaya. Maybe the stories come from teams that want to see us weaker,’ he said.

Kompany’s absence with a calf strain picked up against CSKA means Toure could even wear the captain’s armband at Loftus Road if Pablo Zabaleta is given a rest.

The injury to Kompany gives a chance to £32million summer signing Eliaquim Mangala, who has had poor reviews since becoming the Premier League’s most expensive defender.

‘He has not played so well in some games but I’m sure he will be an important player for this club,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I remember the criticism (Martin) Demichelis had, now it is the same for Mangala.’

City will be chasing their fifth league win in six games at Loftus Road — a mention of which Pellegrini, who has been criticised for tactical naivety, dropped in to avert any talk of a crisis.

They sit third in the table behind Chelsea and Southampton.

‘Every club will drop points and show some weakness at some point over the course of a season,’ the Chilean coach asserted.

‘It was the same last year when we lost a few early away games and when we lost to Liverpool. In the end, finally, the title came here again.’
