Sir David Attenborough has described mankind as a 'plague on the Earth' and issued a stark warning that the world must limit population growth.

The 86-year-old presenter bleakly predicted that if humans do not curb burgeoning populations then nature will do it for us.

Sir David, who is a patron of the Population Matters organisation which calls for smaller family sizes, made his comments while speaking to the Radio Times about his latest series for the Eden channel.

Warning: Sir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning that mankind must curb its growing population or nature will do it for us

The face and voice of natural history programmes, his career has spanned 60 years, but David Attenborough said in a Radio Times interview he would not be replaced as a BBC nature frontman.

'The more you go on, the less you need people standing between the animal and camera waving their arms about,' he said.

'It’s cheaper to get someone in front of a camera describing animal behaviour than actually showing you it.'

He said: 'We are a plague on the Earth, it's coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so.

'It's not just climate change; it's sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde.

'Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now.'

Attenborough pointed to the number of television programmes which focus on famine in countries such as Ethiopia, claiming that they illustrate that there are too many people living there to be able to support themselves.

According to Sir David, the situation will only get worse unless 'humanity manages to sort itself out.'

The Population Matters charity predicts that the global population will boom to 9billion from its current 7billion by 2050.

Asia and Africa are expected to see the biggest population rises.

As well as discussing the problems 
associated with a growing world population, Sir David said that he 
unsure whether the BBC will need to replace him when he eventually 
retires despite six decades of successful documentary making.

He
 described his presenting style as a 'bit out of fashion' and said that 
it is cheaper for produces to put someone in front of a camera 
describing the way in which animals behave rather than actually showing 
it.

Asked about who could step into his shoes, the 86-year-old said: 'I’m not sure there’s any need for a new Attenborough.'

As well as Sir David's 
Natural Curiosities series for Eden, some of the veteran presenter's 
landmark series will be re-run on BBC2 starting with 1979 classic Life 
on Earth.

The series will be aired every day from next Monday at 4.15pm.
