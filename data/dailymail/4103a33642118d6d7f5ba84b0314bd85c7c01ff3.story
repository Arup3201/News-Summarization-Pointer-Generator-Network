A deliver driver is facing a life sentence after admitting the savage murder of his nine-week-old daughter who died with a catalogue of horrific injuries including a bite mark on her forehead.

Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, admitted murdering his daughter, Aukse, after changing his plea to guilty two days into his trial at the Old Bailey in London.

He had previously denied murder, claiming his baby daughter had died accidentally by falling out of bed at their home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in September last year.

The jury heard how the two-month-old baby had a bite on her forehead and had suffered repeated blows and violent shaking prior to her death.

Dzesika Urbikaite, 22, who is the child's mother, wept and shook visibly as Medvedevas confessed to the killing.

The agency worker had returned to the house she shared with Medvedevas to find their daughter dead in her cot on September 5 last year.

She rushed the youngster to hospital but doctors were unable to revive her and she was pronounced dead the same evening.

The infant had suffered a catalogue of injuries, including head wounds, lacerated liver, internal bleeding, fractured ribs, bite marks on her head and bleeding in her eyes, caused by shaking and striking.

The court heard how Medvedevas had been looking after her all day.

When interviewed by police, he denied causing the fatal injuries but gave no explanation about how they were caused.

He later claimed that Aukse had fallen off the bed and hit her head while he was asleep.

Then on the day his trial was due to start in May, he produced a radically different account, accepting for the first time that he caused the injuries, the court heard.

He said he had shaken his baby and thrown her on the bed and then from there she fell to the floor, the court heard.

But the prosecutor said that Medvedevas had still failed to account for all the injuries Aukse suffered and there was no explanation for the bite marks on her forehead.

However, an examination of one of the bite marks showed it matched the defendant's teeth imprint, the court heard.

After changing his plea during today's hearing, Judge Timothy Pontius told the jury that they had heard Medvedevas' 'clear and voluntary confession of guilt'.

He told them: 'This is a distressing case and a tragic one. You are relieved of the burden of listening to that evidence.'

Medvedevas continues to deny inflicting the bite mark and the judge has yet to decide whether he was responsible for that particular wound.

Sentencing for his murder charge is set to take place next week but a date has not yet been fixed.

Defence barrister Sallie Bennett-Jenkins said: 'We are satisfied he has fully understood and comprehended the [legal] advice and equally, that he makes this admission of his own free will'.

Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC had previously told the court that the cause of the baby's death was a head injury although there were 'signs of numerous other inflicted injuries too'.

He added: 'Baby Aukse was a helpless infant, entirely dependent upon the love and care of her parents.

'She suffered very serious and extensive injuries - to her head and body, both externally and internally.

'The nature of these injuries tells you what the person who inflicted them intended.

'All those injuries occurred when she was in the sole care of her father.

'As he committed those acts of violence against Baby Aukse, he must have intended to kill her or to cause her really serious harm - that is murder.'
