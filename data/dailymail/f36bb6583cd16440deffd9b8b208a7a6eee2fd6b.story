A city has been carpeted with a million bin bags after a strike by binmen over pay cuts.

Town hall chiefs yesterday issued safety warnings about rats and told residents that flies and bad smells are usually harmless.

But the 240,000 people of Southampton were given no promises on when thousands of tons of rubbish will be cleared. Refuse collectors already in their seventh week of industrial action promised fresh strikes next week.

Although bin teams were back at work 
yesterday, a continuing go-slow means that the backlog of thousands of 
tons will not be cleared before they stop again.

Officials have put the backlog in the
‘Sewer City’ at 2,000 tons, which according to local estimates means as
many as a million bin bags may need to be cleared from streets and 
driveways.

Some families are reported to have banned children from 
playing outside in case they encounter rats, while others have 
complained of ‘sewer-like’ smells.

The Tory-run authority has apologised
to residents and advised people to take rubbish to their local tips if 
possible. Otherwise, they should ‘double-bag’ waste and put bags on top 
of wheelie bins to try to stop animals getting at them.

Overflowing: The rubbish could take six weeks to clear after bin men went on strike

The council said: ‘Where food refuse 
is available, rats often become bolder and people start to notice them 
more.

You should always use gloves when handling refuse and refuse bags 
that might have been contaminated by rats and always thoroughly wash 
your hands with soap and hot water after handling refuse.’

But flies and maggots, the authority 
advised, should not be a threat to health. ‘Many people find maggots 
unpleasant but it is the adult flies that carry the germs,’ residents 
have been told.

The advice said that smells will 
develop quickly in warm weather but ‘although this is unpleasant and can
cause people distress or affect their feeling of well-being, it is not,
in itself, a health hazard’.

Residents were also told there would be no council tax rebates because of the strike.

Around 2,400 Unite and Unison union 
members at the council are taking industrial action over pay cuts for 
those earning more than £17,000. The council says it needs to save 
£25million this year.

City waste chief Andrew Trayer estimated it could take at least two to three weeks to clear the backlog.

Andy Straker, regional organiser of 
Unison, said: ‘With rubbish piling up on the streets and further strike 
action due to take place from Monday, all the council can do is sit in 
their offices and sulk. This city needs leadership from its civic 
officers and all it gets is silly games from grown men acting like silly
boys.’
