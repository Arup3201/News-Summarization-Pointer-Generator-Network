A multi-millionaire who spent £40,000 on a 'Tarzan' climbing frame for his children in the grounds of his country mansion has been ordered to move it - and says the work will cost up to £50,000.

Father-of-five Dominic Wainford, a 44-year-old director whose London-based Wainford Holdings investment firm which has been valued at £30 million, owns historic Heathfield Park in Sussex, a Grade II* listed manor house set in 350 acres of landscaped grounds.

He built the huge adventure playground for his children three years ago and says he was never told he needed planning approval.

Not happy: Dominic Wainford next to the £40,000 climbing frame outside his home in Heathfield Park which he has to move as Wealden Council thinks it's 'bulk and visually unsympathetic'

Now he’s been ordered by Wealden Council to rip it down, with planning officers saying he should have applied for consent and it is 'bulky and visually unsympathetic' and must be shifted.

Mr Wainford has been forced to apply to the council for permission to dismantle it and move it almost 100 feet to the other side of his driveway - work he says will cost £50,000.

He said: 'When we bought the climbing frame, we were told it didn’t need planning permission. You can’t see it from the road and if you had enough strong men you could lift it up, so I was surprised when a planning consultant said we needed permission.'

The playground, which includes a timber play house, climbing frame and slide, is nearly 35 feet long and more than 13 feet high, with three chutes, two slides, bridges and swings.

He said: 'I’ve got five small children from nine months old to seven years and we can see them playing from the window. Sometimes with their friends, there can be 50 children on there and moving it further from the house will make it less safe.

'By the time I’ve paid for planning consultants and everything, it could have cost me £50,000 to get the job done.

'I’d much rather have been told where to put it in the first place and given the money to charity. It’s not fixed to anything and we’re just very disappointed.'

'There’s no animosity towards the council but I’m very disappointed about the whole thing. There’s been some suggestions that we’ve done this deliberately, but that’s not the case.

'We’re going to have to change the drive, put some gates up, and change the flow of traffic, because our main concern is to protect the safety of the children, and where it’s going to is a less safe environment.'

The revised planning application has been agreed by council officers using delegated powers.

Heathfield and Waldron Parish Council clerk Diana Francis said: 'My council supports the revised application and considers it a more suitable site, which would not impact upon the listed building.'

Tom Foxall, historic buildings inspector for English Heritage, said: 'We previously expressed serious concerns about the positioning of a large children’s play area to the east of the Grade II*-listed Heathfield Park, but do not wish to object to this revised proposal to re-site it.'

A Wealden council spokesman said: 'A structure of this size so close to a Grade II* listed building and inside a Grade II historic park, requires planning permission because it dominates its surroundings.

'We have been taking enforcement action to have it moved. We are pleased the owner has now obtained planning permission to move the climbing frame to a location that is more in keeping with the historic landscape at Heathfield Park.'
