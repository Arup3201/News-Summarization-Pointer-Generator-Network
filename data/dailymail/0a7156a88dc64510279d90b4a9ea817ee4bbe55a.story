More and more employees are giving thanks after a wave of stores including Costco and Nordstrom - once open on Thanksgiving - are now closing so that staff can enjoy the holiday with family.

Macy's and Kohl’s have previously led the way for sales to start early - opening on Thanksgiving rather than Black Friday.

A Facebook page called Boycott Shopping on Thanksgiving along with various other online petitions were formed to stop shopping on the family holiday. The Facebook group has almost 7,000 signatures. 

And it appears the campaign is working. 

Open: Despite many employees and shoppers demanding Macy's close on Thanksgiving, they will be open at 6am a day before Black Friday to reel in extra dough 

Black Friday: Black Friday is a hectic shopping holiday where millions brave their way through crowded department stores to snag great deals

Earlier this week Costco announced that they will remain closed on Thursday, followed by Nordstrom, Home Depot and Gamestop. 

Employees 'deserve the opportunity to spend Thanksgiving with their families,' said a Costco representative.

Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores will open at 5:00am on Friday, as will some T.J.Maxx and Marshall’s stores 

The other store locations will open two hours later.

'We consider ourselves an associate-friendly company, and we are pleased to give our associates the time to enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday with family and friends,' TJX spokeswoman Doreen Thompson told NBC.

And it seems the shoppers are on their side,  

'It's very tragic to me to see stores that [are] increasingly opening on the holiday, which is not only a stress to people who are planning on shopping, but also for the workers,' shopper Nadja Gutowski told the Huffington Post.

'We all want the sales, but can you just hold them until Friday?'
