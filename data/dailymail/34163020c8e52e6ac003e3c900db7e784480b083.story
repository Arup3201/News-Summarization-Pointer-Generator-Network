Eleven Saracens players wore concussion-monitoring devices during their 22-6 victory over London Irish at Allianz Park. 

David Strettle scored two tries, but the main talking point was the patches, worn behind the ears, which assess impacts during the game. 

Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths said: ‘As a club we are concerned about the effects of concussion. We have started this programme to get answers.’

The issue of concussion has been brought into the spotlight by the Mail on Sunday. 

Data is collated after matches, but in time it will be streamed ‘live’ and Griffiths added: ‘Instead of saying, “Are you concussed? What is the date? What was the score at half-time?” we will have data which will indicate the blow and whether it is dangerous.’

There was huge relief for Gloucester on Saturday as they hung on to claim a vital 26-25 win against Exeter at Sandy Park — condemning the Chiefs to a third straight defeat in the process.

The visitors were desperate to initiate a revival after losing five of their previous six league matches and tries by Tom Savage and England No 8 Ben Morgan, allied to 13 points from Greig Laidlaw, propelled them to victory at the end of a thrilling second half. 

David Humphreys, Gloucester’s director of rugby, said: ‘Today was all about the result. Today was an important start of a new year and it has given us hopefully the little bit of a kick-start to gain some momentum over the next few weeks.’

Tries by Liam Williams and John Barclay helped the Scarlets claim a first win over the Ospreys since 2011 — as Wayne Pivac’s side beat their Welsh rivals 22-10 in the Guinness Pro 12 at Parc y Scarlets. 

However, the victory came at a cost as the hosts’ Wales prop Rhodri Jones suffered a dislocated shoulder which may keep him out of the Six Nations, and allow veteran Blues tighthead Adam Jones to return to the Test squad. 

Asked about the severity of the injury, Pivac said: ‘Rhodri has dislocated a shoulder unfortunately, so we’ll just have to see. They put it back in but he is in a lot of pain.’
