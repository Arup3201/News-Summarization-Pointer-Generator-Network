A deluge of storms has soaked the eastern United States - dumping two months of of rainfall on Long Island, New York in just two hours this morning.

Flash floods caused hundreds of motorists in New York to abandon their cars of their morning commutes this morning. The story was similar in Baltimore, Maryland, for commuters on Tuesday night. In Detroit, at least two people have died - including a 100-year-old woman - in flooding caused by the heaviest rainfall in more than 80 years.

Torrential rain also battered parts of the western U.S. - forcing daring r escues in Phoenix, Arizona, and causing floods so powerful the water broke down the doors of a hospital in Nebraska.  

The storm that passed over New York today ended mid-morning - but not before it dumped a total of 13.1 inches at Long Island's MacArthur Airport in Islip, said Christopher Vaccaro, spokesman for the National Weather Service.

Five inches fell in a single hour, according to some reports.  

'Wow, they had more than two months of rainfall in two hours,' Vaccaro said. 'It's really quite a dangerous situation. Heavy rainfall coupled with the morning commute is a problem.'

The Seaford Oyster Bay Expressway was partially closed due to flooding, police said, and television video of other roadways showed cars submerged up to their windows.

Authorities say hundreds of cars were abandoned across Long Island.  

Flash flood warnings for Long Island and southeastern Connecticut remained in effect through the morning.

The weather system was the same one that drenched Washington and Baltimore on Tuesday, Vaccaro said. 

In Detroit, Michigan, near-record rainfall has caused massive flooding has made roads impassable, swamped vehicles and flooded basements. 

The heaviest rain since 1925 engulfed the area on Monday, the second-wettest day on record, according to the National Weather Service.

Up to 6 inches of rain fell on Monday in a four-hour period and parts of five interstate highways that run through Detroit and many interior roads remained impassable on Tuesday, said Nicole Lisabeth, a Michigan State Police spokeswoman.

A 30-year-old woman died Monday after suffering a seizure in her car on a flooded road in Warren, a suburb north of Detroit, Lisabeth said. The storm may have also claimed a 100-year-old woman, whose body was found in her basement, she said.

Detroit's sewer systems were overwhelmed by the rain, Mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement. The Detroit Free Press reports that the flooding may be even worse because pumping stations that are meant to channel waters away from highways have been been working correctly because thieves have stolen copper pipe from them to sell for scrap.

Area residents on Tuesday dealt with flooded basements and power outages, and flood warnings from the National Weather Service remained in effect on Tuesday night.

Divers had checked about 70 vehicles left behind by motorists on flooded roadways and have found no one trapped, Lisabeth said. About 1,000 vehicles were abandoned on Monday in Warren, the city's mayor, Jim Fouts, told the MLive.com website.

The flooding forced General Motors Co to close a technical center in Warren and slowed operations of U.S. automakers in the region.

In Arizona, firefighters had to rescue 16 people after their cars were inundated with flash flood waters on Tuesday night. Phoenix resident Illiana Hernandez showing the dramatic moment a man who was stranded on the roof of his car made a harrowing leap to a firetruck as his vehicle was carried away by surging waters. 

Over the weekend, flooding in Nebraska and a backed up sewer pipe caused a wall of water to hit Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearny that burst through the doors and filled the first floor.

On Tuesday evening, the same storm walloped Baltimore, Maryland, causing flash flood there, as well - albeit not as severe as Long Island, New York, experienced
