A vest which can carry up to 7kg in weight and which has 22 nifty pockets for 'essentials' has become a hit with shoppers who are using it instead of paying for carrier bags.

The 'Bagket' – advertised as a bag and jacket in one – has been loaded up with grocery items by shoppers in Glasgow, Scotland, who are using it instead of paying 5p for plastic bags.

The unusual jacket, which costs nearly £70, can hold a two litre bottle of milk, a litre bottle of orange juice and a 750ml bottle of bleach, as well as grocery 'essentials' such as eggs, apples, cereal, bread and butter.

Shopper John Paul Breslin, who used his jacket to carry his groceries home from Tesco in Finnieston, Glasgow, managed to squeeze in dozens of 'essentials' including milk, bread, butter, apples, eggs and bananas

Originally designed for travellers who want to beat excessive airport baggage charges by 'wearing' their luggage through customs, the 'Bagket' has become popular for a whole other reason.

John Paul Breslin, who used his jacket to carry his grocery shopping home from Tesco in Finnieston, Glasgow, said he had 'taken on the problems of the new bag charge and emerged victorious'.

Shops and supermarkets in Scotland now charge customers for plastic carrier bags, as part of a bid to encourage sustainable behaviour and cut down on environmental waste.

Wales and Northern Ireland also charge shoppers 5p for carrier bags, and England is set to follow suit in October next year.

Mr Breslin, who said the jacket was 'comfortable', stuffed the waistcoat's front pockets full of goods including milk, orange juice and a bottle of bleach.

He used two large mesh pockets, just inside the front of the jacket, to store a packet of six apples, a loaf of bread and a 500g tub of butter.

In a handy pouch at the back of jacket, he managed to tuck away a box of cereal and a French baguette, while a strap on the shoulder was the perfect place for a bunch of bananas.

He also managed to fit a box of cereal, a French baguette, a one litre bottle of orange juice, chocolate powder, two toilet rolls and some chocolate bars into the unusual waistcoat which is called a 'Bagket' and costs £69.99

Shops and supermarkets in Scotland have joined Northern Ireland and Wales in charging 5p for plastic bags 

Pouches on the front and sides of the jacket made room for a tub of drinking chocolate powder, two toilet rolls and a packet of eggs. And he also managed to squeeze in some bars of chocolate.

He said: 'It was clear as I made my way home with my shopping that I'd gotten the attention of my fellow shoppers.

'I could see them smiling in appreciation of my ingenuity as I passed them.

'I imagine it won't be long before you're all wearing a similar garment.'

A spokesman for Bagket Limited, the company behind the £69.99 waistcoat, said she was delighted shoppers were using the jacket to store their grocery goods.

She said: 'We've had a lot of comments from customers telling us all the different uses they have found for Bagket, but a full grocery shop has certainly been one of the most impressive.'
