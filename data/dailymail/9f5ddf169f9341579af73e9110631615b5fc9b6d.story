The father of a seven-year-old boy killed in the Newtown school shooting has a message for Richard Martinez: You're not alone.

Mark Barden has written a heart-wrenching open letter to the man whose son was gunned down by Elliot Rodger in Santa Barbara last weekend - offering his condolences and his support. 

'We have not met, but you are now part of our extended family,' Barden writes in a Facebook message.

'It is not a family we chose, but a family born from the horrible circumstance of losing a child to gun violence - one that’s only growing each day.'

Mr Martinez's son 20-year-old Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was killed Friday as he walked into a convenience store - one of three students shot dead by Rodger.

The son of an assistant Hunger Games Director stabbed his three roommates to death and also killed himself in a rampage that left seven dead and 13 injured.

Mr Martinez has been a furiously outspoken since the day after his son's murder. In one speech he blamed the seven deaths on 'craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.'

On Tuesday, he brought 20,000 mourning college students to their feet with his chant 'Not One More' at a memorial service for the victims of Rodger's rampage.

Mark and his wife Jackie have been similarly outspoken since their son Daniel was gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012.

They have appeared alongside President Barack Obama as he pushed for increasing gun control and background check restrictions.

They have also granted numerous media interviews - perhaps more than any other Newtown family - to talk about their son's legacy and to advocate for laws that they say could help prevent future mass shootings.

Police have said that Rodger was carrying three semi-automatic handguns that he purchased legally from a local gun shop.
