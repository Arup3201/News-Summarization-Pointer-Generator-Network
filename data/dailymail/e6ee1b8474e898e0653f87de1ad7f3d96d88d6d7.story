Winning everything suits Paul Pogba.

While France now look unrecognisable from the disgraced 2010 World Cup 'team', and regardless of what happens in Friday's quarter-final, will return home to an appreciative welcome, the Juventus ace will probably feel short-changed.

That is simply his nature.

The 21-year old fears no-one and backs himself, permanently and unreservedly. His single-mindedness has raised eyebrows, yet, given his spectacular rise and success, does not appear to have harmed him.

Eyes on the prize: Pogba follows the flight of the ball before looping a header to make it 1-0

His headed goal against Nigeria last night is another step toward tightening his grip on his place in France's midfield, within a squad bursting with positivity.

In many ways, the most exciting element now, for quarter-finalists France, is what the next tournament holds.

A future under Didier Deschamps is tantalising with promise, punctuated by the younger and hugely motivated players.

Moreover, this World Cup has proven those who are bursting onto the scene are capable of carving out victories, not just making individual impressions.

There was room for both Pogba and benched Real Sociedad winger, Antoine Griezmann, to start. It wouldn't have been placing all unhatched eggs into one basket.

Yet the eternally inconsistent, always either brilliant or thoroughly pedestrian, Olivier Giroud, started and not until the substitution could Karim Benzema rifle through the middle in his preferred position.

Pogba may feel as if he were slightly isolated in the first half, but trebled his effort after the break and certainly didn't look at risk of receiving a second back-heel nutmeg from John Obi Mikel.

The dynamic among individuals in France is curious.

Giroud smiles, while aware of his dips in form. Benzema is rebuilding his own pride, slowly, the ache of having his dedication, and even ability, questioned during a goalless period for France which lasted 1,224 minutes, finally ending - after 58 shots – against Australia in October last year.

Formidable: At Juventus, Arturo Vidal and Pogba have formed an exceptional central-midfield partnership

Pogba is a talisman, buoyed by a solid two years – and two Scudetti – at Juve, adorned with a £60million price tag and reported keen interest from Chelsea.

In a similar manner to how the phrase 'complete midfielder' has been bestowed on Monaco's Columbian James Rodriguez, it has been afforded to Pogba.

Forward runs, technical ability and the well-handled assurance which comes from being both young and having played at the top level.

Of course, the Under-20 World Cup winner is also a complete joy to watch. Curled free kicks into top netting are one thing, following that curve which, with Pogba, starts from a skip onto a moving ball and shifts into a volley is poetic.

Then there's the love lost in England. While Manchester United fans will be looking in healthy anticipation to the fabulous Dutch master, Louis Van Gaal, channel-hopping through highlights of Pogba's artistry will perhaps grate.

Having completed his transfer to Old Trafford in October 2009, Pogba went on to score seven goals in 21 appearances for the under-18 team, prompting Sir Alex Ferguson to promote him, alongside three other academy players, to the first team.

Fergie saw his remarkable ability early on, tactically observing if Pogba were to have been held back, he would leave for another club.

What he may not have accounted for, however, is how 'special treatment' is exactly why Pogba looked elsewhere.

He signed for Juventus in summer 2012, complaining of how United had forced him to train alone, and somehow disrespected his status as 'an athlete, not a footballer'.

Cynics, or perhaps just most of us, who fail to make this professional distinction, predicted another 'Le Sulk' in the making.

Pogba's attitude was frequently a point of discussion, the prodigious talent criticised for what many saw as petulance and arrogance, but for Juventus boss Antonio Conte, demonstrated an iron-cast ambition.

Conte praised Pogba for his response to picking up the Golden Boy award in December last year, Tuttosport's annual award for recognising the best Under-21 footballer in Europe.

The player said he wanted to win 'everything', and some interpreted this as if the award were a tick in a box rather than an achievement to savour.

What could have been: United let Pogba leave and now he has become a star for club and country

Conte, in a far more measured way than those who scrutinise each of Pogba's actions to deride, said it showed hunger and was certainly not disrespectful. What is seldom open for debate, is Pogba's pronounced domestic form.

Few managers are in a position to guarantee first-team football during academy graduates' contract negotiations, therefore United fans shrugged him off.

Maybe now, they wonder what could have been.
