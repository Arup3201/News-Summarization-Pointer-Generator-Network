The man accused of murdering his wife and three children, confided in a stripper about his failing marriage and resentment toward his family obligations in the lead up to the gruesome slaying, according to testimony in his murder trial.

In the case against Christopher Vaughn, prosecutors are painting the picture of a man who had grown tired of his Chicago suburban life and whose frustration fueled his rage against his family.

Vaughn, from Oswego, Illinois, is accused of the fatal shootings of his wife Kimberly, 34, and their three children - 12-year-old Abigayle, 11-year-old Cassandra and 8-year-old Blake on June 14, 2007.

Cut short: Christopher Vaughn allegedly told his family they were taking an adventure, when he drove them into the woods and shot them dead

Police say the father told his family they were going to take an adventure in the woods.

He packed the family into their SUV but when they arrived at the campground, he allegedly shot them dead as they were strapped in their seat belts.

Vaughn has pleaded not-guilty to four counts of first-degree murder, claiming that he did not kill his family but that his wife had killed the children and then turned the gun on herself.

In the third week of Vaughn's trial at the Will County courthouse in Joliet, outside Chicago, an exotic dancer, Maya Drake, testified that Vaughn had visited Scores Gentlemen's Club, where she worked, in the weeks before the crime, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

She described how Vaughn came to the Chicago area strip club, on four or five occasions and had discussed a feud he had with his wife over expensive drapes that she had ordered for their home.

Vaughn was said to be enraged that his 
wife was materialistic and he shared how he dreamed of breaking free of all 
responsibility for his family.

'He told me that he wanted to leave his wife and move to Canada and build his own home or cabin in the woods,' Drake said.

'He said [his wife] was going to get what she deserved. She wasn't going to see it coming,' she added.

Vaughn had been stockpiling wilderness gear, according to police.

Officers uncovered a storage unit he had rented that was full of camping gear, tin cups and plates, sleeping bags, boots and camp tools in addition to a jar of peanut butter and a bottle of Jameson Irish Whiskey.

Another stripper, Chrystal Miller, had testified in late August about Vaughn's visit to the club, describing him as a 'very timid'  customer.

She said he spent upwards of $5,000 each on two visits to the establishment, in the weeks before his family's murder.

In addition to the testimony from the exotic dancer, prosecutors discussed Vaughn's psychological state by introducing journal entries from Vaughn following his arrest in June 2007.

In the entries, he poetically describes his life without making a single mention to his wife and three children.

'They were musings, some daily event items, just kind of a journal,' Scott Hull, an FBI forensic examiner said on the stand, before reading several of the entries.

'This journal will serve as a written daily meditation,' Hull said, quoting the writings, 'The ups and down, feelings and thoughts and lessons of each day.'

Much of Vaughn's jail house writings include his list of dream activities he would like to take part in, were he not incarcerated.

His wish list includes wanting to sit outside to feel the sun or take a walk barefoot.

Other reveries includes feeling a breeze on his face, enjoying an embrace, taking a nap in his Jeep, drinking apple brandy by a campfire and eating biscuits and gravy — with lots of sausage.
