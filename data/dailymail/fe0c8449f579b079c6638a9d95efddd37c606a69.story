Burnley boss Sean Dyche believes Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers is a victim of his own success.

The pair worked together at Watford in 2008/09, Rodgers in his first management role and Dyche as academy coach, and go head to head in the Barclays Premier League for the first time on Boxing Day.

They remain in contact, meeting earlier this year for dinner and sharing occasional text messages since the Clarets won promotion in the summer.

Last term saw both men enjoying the best time of their coaching career, Burnley defying the odds in the Championship and Liverpool falling agonisingly short in an unexpected title bid.

Rodgers' stock has plummeted in the intervening months, with the Reds sitting 10th having already lost seven times, but Dyche believes a sense of perspective helps his case.

'He's got his question marks now but in the grand scheme of things he's a good coach,' Dyche said.

'I think overall Brendan's done very, very well, it's just that the demands from last season, going so high, are seemingly making what's happening now look nowhere near as good as before,' he said.

'But if you look historically they were middle-ish, having a look at the top then dropping away a little.

Dyche claimed the Northern Irishman was a victim of high expectations after last year's success 

'The perception of what they are changes on the fact that last year they went so close to taking it. I think it was a fantastic achievement to get so close last year.'

Dyche happily opens up on his relationship with Rodgers, but concedes he has a professional as well as a personal interest in seeing the latter succeed.

Although from Northern Ireland, Rodgers is seen as something of a flag-bearer for young home-grown coaches - and is often grouped in with the aspiring British coaches.

'We are always respectful friends. As you can imagine with his life and my life, they are full on. It's not like we're ringing each other every night for half an hour,' Dyche said.

'But now and again we'll have a little chat, a catch-up, the odd text 'good result' etc.

'He's a good guy, I like him a lot and respect him.

'We have to have people doing well who are English or British, fuelling the belief at the top level, from boards and fans even, that there are good English, British coaches out there doing good work.

'To promote British coaches there has to be British coaches doing well and it has to be at the top level.

'He is certainly one of them.'
