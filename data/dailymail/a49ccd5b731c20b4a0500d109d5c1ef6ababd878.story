A petrified Australian woman was left screaming for her life as a stampeding elephant chased her safari tour Jeep.

Liz Jacobs was on a wildlife excursion in Sri Lanka's Kaudulla National Park when she began begging her tour driver to steer clear of a large herd of elephants. 

But as one of the large animals, displeased with the tour group's close proximity, began to chase their car, Ms Jacobs erupted into a bout of shrill ear-splitting shrieks.

Starting off by running in line with the vehicle, it wasn't long before the elephant appeared only metres behind the jeep which had sped up to avoid its reach.

'We're going to crash into them!' Ms Jacobs could be heard screaming while repeating the word 'no, no, no'. 

Despite the elephant trumpeting its warning in the distance, Ms Jacobs' squeals drowned out the animal's sounds as she yelled to the drivers, 'faster, faster! Keep going!'

'We really thought we were gonna die for a moment and then the elephant just backed off,' she said after the event, according to Nine News.

Ms Jacobs' shrill ear-splitting shrieks drowned out the animal's trumpeting as the Australian admitted she was convinced that she was going to die 

'I must have hurt his ears with my screaming!'

Ms Jacobs can be heard sobbing in the footage towards the end of the video after the elephant finally gave up the chase. 

'We didn't want to go near them, but the drivers just kept going and did what they're paid to do,' she said.

'We did swing wide to avoid the elephants as we didn't want to interfere with them. But one jeep in particular just got too close.

'The elephant started to charge and the other jeep overtook us leaving us to be chased.

'Then they stopped so we would be trapped, but I kept yelling at them to keep going.'
