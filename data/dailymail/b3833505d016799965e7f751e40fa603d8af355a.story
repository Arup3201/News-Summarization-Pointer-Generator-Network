They've been Sydney's top radio duo for over seven years and 55 FM surveys.

But on Tuesday it was announced that KIIS FM's Kyle & Jackie O show was dethroned from the number one radio spot by ARN stablemates, Jonesy & Amanda.

It will be a real blow to the ego for the shock jock and his blonde co-host, who defected from 2DayFM last year after bosses refused Sandilands' demand to double his salary from $2million to $4million.

Popping bottles! Brendan 'Jonesy' Jones and Amanda Kelly celebrate their placing first in the Sydney breakfast radio spot. It marks the first time in seven years Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'Jackie O' Henderson haven't snagged the top spot

The first survey of the year in April saw the Kyle and Jackie O emerged triumphant on their new network, but the numbers have now dipped.

Sandilands and Jackie Henderson lost 1.4% from their previous 10.9% share, giving them of 9.5% of the pie, while Brendan 'Jonesy' Jones and Amanda Keller enjoyed a massive boost from 8.2% to a 10% share.

Keller insists the KIISFM team were 'very gracious,' in defeat after Tuesday's announcement, adding: 'Their whole team came in today to say congratulations.'

However Sandilands didn't join Jackie O and the rest of the team - he had called in sick before the results were announced.

But Jonesy wasn't fussed by the absence of his competitor, saying 'I don't think he'd really care.'

He said beating the pair was like 'Coyote catching the Road Runner'.

'Honestly, I am stunned,' Jones added. 'It’s like the great white whale.'

'When we first started working together nine years ago we went No.1,' Keller explained of the victory, 'and it was our running joke that no one ever said we had to do it again.'

Jonesy and Amanda said the WSFM team celebrated with champagne, lunch and karaoke. 

Also revealed in the survey was a drop for 2DayFM breakfast team, comprised of Sophie Monk, Merrick Watts, Jules Lund and Mel B, who now find themselves with a 3.5% share, while Nova 96.9's Fitzy & Wippa lose just under a full percent leaving them with 7.1% of the coveted audience.

Meanwhile, MIX FM's Chrissie Swan and Jane Hall made the top Melbourne FM spot for the first time ever, beating out Eddie McGuire's Hot Breakfast on Triple M.

Kyle and Jackie O were 2DayFM's prized radio team before moving to KIISFM earlier this year, and taking their massive audience with them.

The duo left Southern Cross Austereo station last November.

They had been with the station for 13 years before moving to KIIS FM, where they first broadcast from in January of this year.

When 2014's first survey results were released it appeared as though Sandilands may have been worth the money he demanded, as the Kyle & Jackie O show boosted the station's share from 4.9% to a whopping 8.8%.

2DayFM suffered a massive loss in the wake of the departure, with their ratings plunging from 8.7% to 4.2%.
