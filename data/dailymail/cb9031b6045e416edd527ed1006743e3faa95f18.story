Didi Hamann will be forever associated with the Champions League after his part in Liverpool’s legendary win against AC Milan in the 2005 final.

Hamann came on as a half-time substitute with Liverpool trailing 3-0 and is credited with helping their remarkable comeback as Rafa Benitez’s side fought back to draw 3-3 and win on penalties.

With the 2015 Champions League knockout stages due to begin this week, Hamann — also a German World Cup finalist in 2002 — casts his eye over all the ties with reporter Joe Bernstein.

PARIS ST GERMAIN v CHELSEA

Tues, Feb 17 7.45pm, ITV1

Jose Mourinho and Chelsea know what the Champions League is all about. Mourinho has won it with Porto and Inter and Chelsea lifted the trophy three years ago. They know what it takes get a result in Paris and finish the job off at Stamford Bridge. 

I am yet to be convinced by PSG, it takes more than buying quality players to win the Champions League and they are not proven at this level. It’s amazing that Zlatan Ibrahimovic hasn’t won the competition and David Luiz will be the centre of attention against his former club. 

Winners: Chelsea

The Champions League is one of the few trophies that has so far eluded PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic

SHAKHTAR DONETSK v BAYERN  MUNICH

Tues, Feb 17 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1

This tie would have been hard enough for Shakhtar anyway but it has been made even tougher by having to play their home leg in Lviv because of the troubles in Donetsk. However, Bayern have won only one in five matches in Ukraine. 

I expect Arjen Robben to be the key. He has been the top scorer in Munich for the past 18 months, Robert Lewandowski hasn’t hit the ground running after his move from Dortmund and Franck Ribery’s injuries have limited his playing time. 

Winners: Bayern Munich

SCHALKE v REAL MADRID

Weds, Feb 18 7.45pm, Sky Sports 5

Gareth Bale scored twice at Schalke last season when Real Madrid won 6-1. I find it strange he isn’t loved by Real fans because I don’t think he could have done more for them. 

Schalke have done well since the mid-winter break and will fancy their chances at home, particularly after signing Matija Nastasic on loan. He’s a good defender and I was surprised he didn’t feature more at Man City. Schalke manager Roberto di Matteo knows how to cause a Champions League shock but even so the holders have so much quality.

Winners: Real Madrid

It is incredible that Real Madrid fans have criticised Gareth Bale at the Bernabeu this season

BASEL v PORTO

Wed, Feb 18 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1

I was impressed by Basel when I saw them knock out Liverpool in the group stages. They have some good young players — defender Fabian Schar is outstanding, Fabian Frei is a proper midfielder and Marco Streller is still doing a job at 33.

Porto are opponents that won’t suit them. They have a lot of power in their team and, with goalscorer Jackson Martinez, they might be too powerful.

Winners: Porto

Porto forward Jackson Martinez could pack too much power for surprise package Basel

JUVENTUS v BORUSSIA DORTMUND

Tues, Feb 24 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1

A fascinating tie. I fancied Dortmund when the draw was made but have changed my mind as they are struggling in the Bundesliga, while Juventus are dominating Serie A and have some great players, such as Carlos Tevez, Andrea Pirlo and Paul Pogba. 

Dortmund have saved their best for Europe but recently their priority has been the league because of the relegation danger. Too many players have been out of form.

Winners: Juventus

Paul Pogba (centre) will be hoping Juventus' domestic domination can extend into Europe

MANCHESTER CITY v BARCELONA

Tues, Feb 24 7.45pm, ITV 1

Barcelona have started to fire while City have been so inconsistent, drawing 1-1 at home to Hull and then winning 4-1 at Stoke. City will take heart from last season, when they took Barcelona to the wire at the Nou Camp. 

But Barca have so much European experience on their side. It will be Luis Suarez’s first game in England since he left Liverpool and he has found it difficult in Spain. He was the boss at Liverpool and that suited him, whereas that is not the case at Barca. It hasn’t really worked out for him and there is every chance he will leave this summer. 

Winners: Barcelona

Luis Suarez (centre) will be playing in his first game back in England since leaving Liverpool for Barcelona

ARSENAL v MONACO

Weds, Feb 25 7.45pm, Sky Sports 5

I expect big things from Arsenal, they are capable of beating any team on their day. If only they’d break the bank for someone like Morgan Schneiderlin from Southampton and they would be serial trophy winners. A lot of people would like to see Arsene Wenger have a proper run in this year’s competition and they have the best possible draw. 

Although Monaco did well to win their group, they are not the team that spent big money on James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao. If Arsenal have anything about them, they have to get through this game. Mesut Ozil is key and can turn matches like this. 

Winners: Arsenal 

Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil's sublime skills are tailormade for the Champions League stage

BAYER LEVERKUSEN v ATLETICO MADRID

Wed, Feb 25 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1

Atletico were so close in the final against Real last year. Everyone seemed to think they would fade away this season but it hasn’t happened. I’m impressed at how Diego Simeone has got Fernando Torres going again. Torres has been woeful for three years, and I always felt the only place he could rediscover his form was at Liverpool or Atletico.

Leverkusen didn’t start too well after the mid-winter break in Germany but their South Korean star Son Heung-min is now back from the Asian Cup. They have missed him but Atletico are so well-oiled and hard to break down.

Winners: Atletico
