Marcus Bebb-Jones is due to be sentenced today for the murder of his wife Sabrina, who was 31 when he killed her and dumped her body in a Colorado national park in 1997

A British poker champion faces up to 20 years in jail today for the murder of his wife in America 16 years ago.

Marcus Bebb-Jones had denied killing his wife Sabrina in 1997 before dumping her body in a Colorado national park, but pleaded guilty earlier this year.

The couple owned the Melrose Hotel in Grand Junction, Colorado, when Mrs Bebb-Jones disappeared.

Her skull was found in 2004 by a rancher in a national park near Douglas Pass in north-west Colorado.

Professional gambler Bebb-Jones was arrested in 2009 in a raid at his home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.

Prosecutors said he went on to spend thousands of dollars on his wife's credit cards before shooting himself in the head in a botched suicide attempt.

He then moved back to the UK with their son, who was three at the time.

Bebb-Kones then became a well-known competitor on the UK poker circuit, winning Â£90,000 in the Grosvenor Grand Prix in 2007, reports the Birmingham Mail.

The 49-year-old lost his appeal against extradition to the US in 2011 and was due to stand trial.

In February, he pleaded guilty at a hearing in the 9th Judicial District Court in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.

After the admission, his wife's family asked for: 'the maximum penalty for his cruelty, lack of remorse and for taking Sabrina from them.'

He will be sentenced today in Colorado and could face up to 20 years in prison.

District Attorney Sherry Caloia said Bebb-Jones had made a plea bargain, admitting murder in the second degree, blaming it on 'heat of passion', in exchange for a sentence of no more than 20 years.

It is possible the judge could reject the plea bargain, which would mean the case would go back to negotiations, or to trial, but this is thought to be unlikely.

Prosecutors said Bebb-Jones gave a number of differing accounts of the day his wife disappeared but in each one he claimed that she had walked out on him after an argument while they were on a day trip.

An employee at their hotel reported Sabrina missing on September 18, 1997, the day after Bebb-Jones had left for Las Vegas with his son Daniel.

Before then, Bebb-Jones had taken his minivan for a clean, but police later found traces of his wife's blood inside.

On September 21, Daniel was found alone in a hotel room and taken into care. His father was found the next day by a maid with a gunshot wound to the head, which was self-inflicted.

Bebb-Jones returned to the UK with his son in 1998 and had refused to co-operate with US police.

Sabrina's skull was found in 2004 near purple thistle flowers which had also been found underneath Bebb-Jones's van.

This led to the start of extradition proceedings and today's sentencing, which brings a 16-year case to a close.
