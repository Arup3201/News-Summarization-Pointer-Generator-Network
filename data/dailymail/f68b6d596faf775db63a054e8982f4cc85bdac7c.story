Nigel Mansell believes that the world championship fight between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will go down to the last race of the season, a scenario that will put Formula One’s most controversial rule in the spotlight.

The final round of the championship will carry double points for the first time, meaning either man would need to be 51 ahead going to Abu Dhabi to be assured of taking the title.

With Rosberg now leading by 29 points, Mansell said: ‘So Hamilton is a few points behind but there’s so many more races to go. I don’t see it as a problem.

‘There’s nothing really, with a lot of races. Are their cars both going to finish? I think it will come down to what reliability each one of them has.

‘Destiny will determine it. It will come down to the last race. In fact, it can be an advantage to come from behind because if Lewis starts to perform a little bit better than Nico, the pressure will transfer from Lewis to Nico.’

Hamilton has won four races to Rosberg’s three so far, but mechanical problems, whether brought about by ill luck or by pushing too hard, means he trails by more points than the score of a race win, 25.

Mansell knows what it is like to lose the title despite winning more races than the champion. It was a fate he suffered in his final two F1 seasons, including to his Williams team-mate Nelson Piquet.

‘I’ve been there and done that,’ he said. ‘I know how that feels.

‘I don’t think all the mechanical problems in the end will be with Lewis. There will be a few spanners thrown into the works somewhere.’
