Click here to read a full match report from Swansea's latest defeat. 

Michael Laudrup's future at Swansea City is once again uncertain with elements of the club’s board believed to be keen for him to leave before the end of the season.

It has long been assumed within the club that the Dane would leave at the end of this season.

But Sportsmail understands there are factions of the club’s hierarchy who would rather see Laudrup leave sooner, with Swansea struggling in the Barclays Premier League.

Weak: The Swans were dismal in their defeat at West Ham and Laudrup could go before the end of the season

They were dire in falling 2-0 against West Ham on Saturday and go into the weekend’s south Wales derby against Cardiff City only two points clear of the bottom three.

Huw Jenkins told the BBC on Sunday night that the club were not discussing a move to sack the manager – a measure they have not taken since Brian Flynn was dismissed 10 years ago.

Furthermore, senior figures at the club believe it is unlikely that such a drastic step would occur.

However, the board is extremely unhappy with the team’s performances on the pitch and there are elements who believe a quick change might be necessary to avoid a relegation fight.

Trouble: There were serious disagreements at board level over the signing of £12m Wilfried Bony

It is sorry state of affairs for a manager who led Swansea to their first major trophy last season and has guided the team to historic wins at Valencia and Manchester United this season.

But he came extremely close to leaving in the summer and the team has struggled enormously to gain any kind of consistency in results or performances in this hectic campaign, in which they have done well to reach the knockout stages of the Europa League.

Part of the issues in the summer surrounded Laudrup’s frustration over transfers, in particular suggestions that they sign Marvin Emnes or Kenwyne Jones. He was ultimately backed to sign Wilfried Bony for a record transfer fee of £12million, but Emnes was signed on deadline day on loan from Middlesbrough.

Laudrup is currently in Paris on holiday and due back on Tuesday.

Dismal: The latest defeats means City have won just one league game since the start of December
