U.S. authorities are tonight moving to extradite Joran van der Sloot to face charges over the Natalee Holloway case after he was jailed for 28 years in Peru for murdering a woman he met at a casino.

The 24-year-old Dutch citizen pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing business student Stephany Flores, 21, in Lima, Peru, in a fit of rage in May 2010, after earlier meeting her in a casino.

His sentencing by a Peruvian court on Friday comes as the family of U.S. teenager Miss Holloway seek to have him prosecuted in America over her disappearance seven years ago.

Speaking out: Van der Sloot said in jailhouse letters that he hopes the Flores family can forgive him and blames 'bad legal advice' for his lengthy sentence

The court also ordered Van der Sloot to pay $75,000 in reparations to the family of Stephany Flores

Now the legal process is Peru has 
finished for the moment, Van der Sloot is expected to be extradited to 
the U.S. within a few months over claims he extorted $25,000 from Miss 
Holloway's grieving mother.

Parents of both women hope his next
 stop will be Alabama, where he faces charges of 
extorting the cash from Beth Holloway to reveal where her 
daughter's body was - which he allegedly never did.

On Friday the Peruvian court also ordered him to pay $75,000 in reparations to Miss Flores's family.

He can still appeal the 
conviction and sentence - his first ever, despite prosecutor claims that
 he was involved in Miss Holloway's apparent death on the Dutch 
Caribbean island of Aruba.

Under Peru's penal system, Van der 
Sloot could become eligible for parole after serving half of the 
sentence with good behaviour, including work and study.

The prosecution had sought a 30-year 
sentence for first-degree murder and theft, so the court’s decision 
represents what is close to the perfect outcome for them.

Van der Sloot's lawyer argued that his
 client killed Miss Flores two years ago during a fit of rage he blamed 
on psychological trauma from being hounded as the prime suspect in the 
Holloway case.

'A jail isn't a five-star hotel. Let's hope the authorities take that into account and not just in our case'

Ricardo Flores, Stephany's father

The victim's father, Ricardo Flores, 
complained after the verdict that Van der Sloot was enjoying favourable 
conditions in a Lima prison.

Mr Flores said the criminal has been 
living apart from the general population and added foreigners with money
 can buy superior treatment.

‘A jail isn't a five-star hotel,’ he said. ‘Let's hope the authorities take that into account and not
 just in our case.’

Mr Flores added that he has been 
complaining about the excessive privileges that Van der Sloot allegedly 
enjoyed in jail. He said he would present evidence of this at a news 
conference on Monday.

Unconfirmed news reports denied by penal authorities say Van der Sloot has also had a television and video gaming console.

The Holloway case remains open and a 
judge on Thursday declared her dead. Her parents want Van der Sloot to 
eventually be extradited to the U.S. and tried on related charges.

He has been indicted in extortion 
charges there for allegedly offering to lead a lawyer for Miss 
Holloway's mother to her daughter's remains.

Van der Sloot long ago confessed the 
Flores killing, telling police he got enraged after the student found 
his connection to the Holloway disappearance on his laptop while they 
played poker online.

Police forensic experts disputed that 
version, and the victim's family said Van der Sloot killed Miss Flores 
in order to rob her.

The prosecution said Van der Sloot 
killed her with ‘ferocity’ and ‘cruelty,’ concealing the crime and 
fleeing to Chile, where he was caught two days after Miss Flores' 
decaying body was found.

He took more than $200 in cash plus 
credit cards from the victim and made his initial getaway in her car, 
leaving it in a different part of Lima, prosecutors say.

‘We've been dealing with her death for
 the last six and a half years,’ Dave Holloway said after the court 
hearing regarding his own daughter’s disappearance in Birmingham, 
Alabama, on Thursday.

'We've been dealing with her death for the last six and a half years. We've still got a long way to go to get justice'

Dave Holloway, Natalee's father

He said the judge's order in Alabama 
on his daughter's death closes one chapter in the ordeal, but added: 
‘We've still got a long way to go to get justice.

'Everybody knows his personality,' he said of Van der Sloot. 'He is beyond rehabilitation.'

Miss Flores was slain five years to 
the day after Miss Holloway, an 18-year-old from the wealthy Birmingham 
suburb of Mountain Brook, disappeared.

Van der Sloot now faces charges in Alabama accusing him of 
extorting $25,000 from Beth Holloway to reveal the location of her 
daughter's body.

Prosecutors said the money was paid, but 
nothing was disclosed about the woman's whereabouts. Authorities said 
they believe the tall Dutchman used the money to travel to Peru on May 
14, 2010.

Natalee Holloway disappeared on May 30, 2005, during a high school graduation trip to Aruba, where Van der Sloot grew up.

Her body was never found and repeated searches turned up nothing as intense media coverage brought the case worldwide attention.

Investigators have long worked from 
the assumption that the young woman was dead in Aruba, where the case 
was classified as a homicide investigation.

That investigation remains open, 
though there has been no recent activity, said Solicitor General Taco 
Stein, an official with the prosecutor's office in Aruba.

In Birmingham, Natalee Holloway's 
parents, who have been divorced since 1993, shook hands and talked 
briefly before the hearing. During the 10-minute proceeding, they looked
 on soberly.
