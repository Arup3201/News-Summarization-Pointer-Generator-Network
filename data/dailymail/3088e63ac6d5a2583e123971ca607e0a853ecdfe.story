Richard Cockerill doesn’t know if he’s upset too many people at the RFU to ever be considered for the England head coach’s job. He doesn’t particularly care.

The Leicester Tigers director of rugby has lost count of the number of times he’s been ticked off by the authorities for bad behaviour — including two hefty bans for verbally abusing match officials — and the only people he worries about upsetting with his foul-mouthed tirades are his wife, Sarah, and their young family.

‘My wife just looks at me and says, “What have you done now?”’ said Cockerill.

‘My kids remind me when I’m reprimanding them. They say, “You say naughty words and on television as well dad”. I have to hold my hands up.

‘I’ve mellowed a bit and learned to control my temper. Although I say that at the start of every season and then get in trouble, so maybe I’ll take that back!’

With three Premiership titles in five years, as well as a European Cup final appearance, Cockerill has delivered enough silverware for the East Midlands giants to justify the touchline rants. He’s second only to Jim Mallinder at Northampton as the longest-serving director of rugby in the Aviva Premiership.

But the 43-year-old, who made 262 first-team appearances for Leicester as a player after signing from Coventry in 1992, still received plenty of stick this summer after the Tigers failed to reach a play-off final for the first time in a decade.

‘Doing this job you have to develop a thick skin,’ he said. ‘Being a director of rugby is often a thankless task, especially at a club like Leicester where people expect you to win and if you don’t you get a load of stick.

‘So you just try to win because that’s what people demand. You’ll have to ask the RFU if I’ve upset them too much (to be England coach). I’ve never really been a career climber. I like going to work and doing what I do. Where that takes me, I don’t know.

‘All I care about is Leicester and I’m passionate about what I do. I make no apologies for that. Some coaches are happy to sit there and watch and be more composed but I like to get involved in what’s going on. I live every tackle and every pass. Whether I grow out of it at some point, who knows? I’m a young 43 and I want to win.’

Last season Leicester didn’t win enough. After failing to make a mark in Europe and losing to Northampton in the Premiership play-off semi-final, the flak flew over the summer, with Lewis Moody and Neil Back two of the high-profile ex-players to get stuck in.

Moody argued skills coach Geordan Murphy should be given more involvement. Cockerill disagrees in typically forthright fashion.

‘Lewis has got about as many brain cells as a bag of crisps,’ he says with a grin about a former team-mate he released in 2010 after 14 years at the club.

‘He has no idea what Geordan does. Lewis has just been a little bit inaccurate but only out of not knowing what day of the week it is.’

Today, Leicester take on Exeter at Sandy Park on the back of a 36-17 opening-day win over Newcastle Falcons. They will do so without club captain Ed Slater, who is out for the season with a cruciate ligament injury.

Cockerill is a hard-nosed realist. Winning pays his bills, and Cockerill knows full well that if his team fail then the club he’s served faithfully for the best part of 22 years — bar a two-year sabbatical in Montferrand — will sack him.

‘This is not just a job for me,’ he said. ‘Some of the cultures we have in place I helped create when I was a player in the 1990s. I care deeply about the club.

‘But as we’ve seen with Dean Richards and John Wells, there are lots of coaches who’ve been players and been at Leicester a lot longer than I have who, when their time is up, their time is up. Thank you and goodbye.

‘The minute you can’t keep the club moving in a forward fashion is the moment you will get the tap on the shoulder. That’s OK. That’s life.’
