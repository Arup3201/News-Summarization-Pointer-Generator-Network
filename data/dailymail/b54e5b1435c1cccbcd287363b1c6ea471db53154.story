From the intricate details of a bee's mouth to the striking lines on the legs of a praying mantis, these incredible images reveal the stunning patterns that are hidden in the world around us.

Each image was taken using a new generation of microscope, dubbed Cytell, which works like an automated 'point and shoot' camera to instantly capture tiny details.

The images were put together by Gary Sarkis, who works for GE Healthcare Life Sciences in New York.

The series began when he took a bee's leg to work after helping his daughter analyse it as part of her school science project.

'My daughter and I observed the leg at home with her toy microscope,' Mr Sarkis said.

'We spent a lot of quality time together moving it around and getting it in focus. 

'But when we were done, we had nothing more to take away than the memory of what the bee's leg looked like.'

In the lab, Mr Sarkis used Cytell to take a closer look. 

The device is designed to allow researchers to rapidly analyses samples such as insect limbs and cells.

The Cytell uses  five "preconfigured biological applications" that the company has branded BioApps. 

Each app directs the system through differemt tasks and lab tests, allowing routine sample testing to be done in a few steps. 

'It allows [scientists] to simply set up very specific kinds of experiments and automatically receive data in the form of graphs, charts and reports to see if they worked," Mr Sarkis said. 

'It's similar to the point-and-shoot camera,' he added. 'It helps take a lot of the microscopist out of getting the perfect shot.

When Mr Sarkis looked at his daughter's sample in his lab with Cytell, 'an amazingly detailed hairy leg popped right up on my computer screen,' he said.

For fun, he also imaged the leg in fluorescent light and saw that it was 'very auto-flourescent,' and generated its own light.

After the first leg, Mr Sarkis imaged the rest of his daughter's collection with the machine. 

After that, he acquired more school samples on Ebay, sold by parents whose children had lost interest. 

'To me, these are hidden treasures which have led to some amazing images,' he says. 

To date, Mr Sarkis has taken over 2,000 pictures with Cytell and assembled a 'best of' list.

'My wife turned a pair into canvas portraits to hang in our house,' he says.

He has since captured stunning images of everything from the hair–like structures on the upper surface of the human tongue to the alien like features of a mosquito head.

On the left is the bee leg that was first imaged using the system. On the right is Diatomaceous earth, also known as diatomite. It is a soft, siliceous sedimentary rock which is made up of fossilised remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae

A bee's mouth is pictured here. It shows the complex tools that the insect uses to eat and drink. Most bees have paired mandibles, or jaws, that sit around a glossa, or tongue. The labrum and maxillae are like lips which support a proboscis, or tube for collecting nectar
