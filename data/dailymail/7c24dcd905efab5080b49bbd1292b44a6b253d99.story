President Assad of Syria is committing systematic mass murder using his regime's 'Machinery of Death' resulting in atrocities not seen since the Holocaust claims the State Department's chief war crimes official.

Nearly 30,000 photographs have been compiled as evidence of the Syrian government's torture, murder and starvation of 10,000 civilians in custody described as akin to genocide and the worst since the Nazis and Adolf Hitler.

Stephen Rapp, the State Department's ambassador-at-large for War Crimes has seen the huge collection of photographic evidence smuggled out of Syria by an intelligence operative known only as 'Caesar' and told The Daily Beast he was shocked and appalled.

'This is solid evidence of the kind of machinery of cruel death that we haven’t seen frankly since the Nazis,' he said.

'If it is as it appears thus far, we’re talking about more than 10,000 individuals being killed in custody over the period from 2011 to 2013, including largely men but also some very, very young men and boys and women… It’s shocking to me, as a prosecutor—I’m used to evidence not being so strong.'

Rapp said that Assad regime is committing crimes against humanity and has called upon the Obama administration to take action against Syrian government forces.

Another war crimes prosecutor told The Daily Beast that he believes the vast collection of photographs reveals indirect 'Russian government responsibility.'

The shocking images were smuggled out of the country last year and emerged in January after a team of international war crimes prosecutors released their report.

Compiled by noted international war crimes prosecutors David Crane, Desmond de Silva, and Geoffrey Nice it said there was 'clear  evidence, capable of being believed by a tribunal of fact in a court of law, of systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the Syrian government' that equalled war crimes and crimes against humanity.

However, 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lvrov has said that the report is not 
conclusive and has asked for independent verification because it was 
funded in part by the Qatari government.

Meanwhile
 Rapp said that the US government had nearly completed its own analysis 
of the 28,000 photographs and preliminary findings show that not only 
are they genuine but that they prove crimes against humanity.

'Thus
 far the indication is that it would be impossible to have fabricated 
this kind of material, and having personally seen hundreds of the images
 of twisted bodies with real wounds and real human beings of every shape
 and size, this is not phony evidence,' he said according to The Daily 
Beast.

'These
 bodies were brought to one location from 24 other facilities, in which 
they had been tortured to death in a variety of ways: ligature 
strangulation, burning, bruising, starvation, evisceration, the most 
horrendous things you can imagine.'

Rapp admitted that since Assad was not attempting to kill one particular set of people that this is not technically genocide.

However, Rapp told The Daily Beast that his crimes against humanity are so heinous that they fit past definitions of genocide.

Rapp added that Assad is legally linked to the crimes because as head of the Syrian government and military he is in command and therefore is responsible.

It is not clear when the State Department and President Obama will be willing to comment on their final review of the images.

International war crimes scholar Cherif Bassiouni—who led the U.N. investigations into war crimes in Yugoslavia, Bahrain, and Libya, and helped create the International Criminal Court told The Daily Beast he sees the hand of Russia in some of the methods of torture.

'We see a pattern of systematicity and discipline in the taking of the pictures, the numbering of the persons, etc., which has never occurred before in the history of Syria. It has occurred in Russia,' he said.

'If I compare the cultural practices of the Syrian military in the past, their practice has always been to torture, kill, get rid of the bodies, get rid of the evidence.

'When you look at the practices of the USSR and the eastern European countries, everything is documented.'

There is however no proof of direct Russian involvement.

If the international community chooses to accept the recommendations of the report then there are three options for future prosecutions of Assad.

The U.N. Security Council could again attempt to refer Assad to the International Criminal Court, or a special inquiry set up.

Thirdly, if the revels win then Assad could be prosecuted within Syria itself.

In Bassiouni’s view, the U.S. will have to act if the evidence is deemed overwhelming.

'It places a moral and legal burden on the United States. The moral burden is self-evident.

'There is a point,' Bassiouni added, 'when you just can’t look the other way.'
