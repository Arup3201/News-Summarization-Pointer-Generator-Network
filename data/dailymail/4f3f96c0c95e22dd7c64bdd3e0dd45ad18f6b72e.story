A New York City police dog is nursing four broken teeth and a cut tongue after he was kicked in the face by a woman brawling in a subway station.

The incident happened when NYPD officer Vincent Tieniber and his German Shepherd Bear were trying to break up a fight at the number 4 train in the 59th Street and Lexington Avenue station.

Police said a 19-year-old woman was being choked by another woman the same age at around 11:15 a.m. on Tuesday. Officer Rafael Diaz was the first on the scene but had to call for back up when Ravenia Matos-Davis, 22, and a 31-year-old woman pushed him after he tried to stop the choking.

That's when Tieniber and Bear arrived. As Tieniber went to handcuff Matos-Davis, the Queens woman lunged at six-year-old Bear, who is part of the Transit Bureau K-9 unit.

She struck the animal twice, resulting in multiple cracked teeth and lacerations on his tongue.

However, probably due to his police training, Bear was quick to react.

'Bear kept the woman's foot in his mouth, and held on until I could handcuff her,' officer Tieniber said in a release.

Tieniber himself suffered a sprained wrist while trying to arrest Matos-Davis.

The dog was taken to Animal Medical Center on East 62nd Street where he was treated and released later in the day.

Bear will have two teeth capped and another two filed and is expected to return to full duty soon.

Bear has been on the job for five years, in which time he and Tieniber, who has been on the force for 11 years, have been praised for many a brave arrest.

Matos-Davis was charged with injuring a police animal, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and obstructing governmental administration.

Police said attacking or killing a police animal is currently only a Class A misdemeanor, however legislation is pending to make it a Class E felony.

Alexandria James, 19, of the Bronx was charged with strangulation and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fight while Tabricia Moore, 31, also of the Bronx, was charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, police said.

The woman James allegedly attacked suffered bruises, scratches and neck pain, but wouldn't go to the hospital, according to police.
