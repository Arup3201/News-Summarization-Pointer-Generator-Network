Britain is to double its support for Syrian opposition forces, as David Cameron left the door open to providing arms in the coming weeks,

The Prime Minister said ending the bloody conflict was the most pressing global challenge, and pledged to step up the non-lethal equipment being shipped to forces trying to overthrow President Assad.

He warned that without providing more than ‘technical advice’ to moderate Syrian rebels, there  was a risk that extremists groups would take hold.

Mr Cameron said that there was an 'urgent window of opportunity' to act in the war-torn country, where 80,000 have been killed and was supported by President Obama

Speaking at a press conference with US President Barack Obama, Mr Cameron said Britain could do more than offer 'technical assistance' to forces trying to overthrow Assad

Mr Cameron was addressing reporters at a joint press conference in the White House with US President Barack Obama.

He said the UK would continue to press for changes to the European Union arms embargo and added: ‘We will double non-lethal support to the Syrian opposition in the coming year. Armoured vehicles, body armour and power generators are about to be shipped.’

An extra £10 million for non-lethal military aid would be made available for Syrian rebels and £30 million more would be ploughed into humanitarian assistance, under the plan outlined today.

Mr Cameron said Assad had to realise there could be no military victory for his forces.

‘There will be no political progress unless the opposition is able to withstand the onslaught and put pressure on Assad so he knows there is no military victory,’ Mr Cameron said.

Last week he held talks with Russian President Vladimr Putin, who remains opposed to the overthrow of Assad.

Mr Cameron said 80,000 people were dead and five million had been forced from their homes as a result of the ‘brutal conflict’ in Syria.

He added: ‘Syria's history is being written in the blood of her people and it is happening on our watch. The world urgently needs to come together to bring the killing to an end.

‘None of us have any interest in seeing more lives lost, in seeing chemical weapons used, or extremist violence spreading even further.’

The UK would increase efforts to ‘support and to shape the moderate opposition’.

Mr Cameron last week met Russian President Vladimir Putin but the two men failed to reached agreement on the need to remove Assad from power in Syria

Mr Cameron also promised more humanitarian assistance for those affected by the violence.

‘There is now common ground between the US, UK, Russia and many others that whatever our differences, we have the same aim: a stable, inclusive and peaceful Syria free from the scourge of extremism.

‘There's real political will behind this. We now need to get on and do everything we can to make it happen.’

Mr Cameron insisted no decision had been made on arming opposition groups in Syria.

‘What we have done is we have amended the EU arms embargo in order that we can give technical assistance and technical advice, and as I said in my statement, that is exactly what we are doing.

‘We are continuing to examine and look at the EU arms embargo and see whether we need to make further changes to it in order to facilitate our work with the opposition.

‘I do believe that there is more we can do alongside technical advice, assistance, help, in order to shape them, in order to work with them.’

Regional tensions have escalated since the twin car bomb attacks in the town of Reyhanli near the Turkish-Syrian border this week

The UK government has drawn up options which including lifting the embargo against giving arms to opponents of the Assad regime

And he challenged critics of his intervention to realise that the consequences of failing to act could be much worse.

‘If we don't help the Syrian opposition - who we do recognise as being legitimate, who have signed up to a statement about the future for Syria that is democratic, that respects the rights of minorities - if we don't work with that part of the opposition, then we shouldn't be surprised if the extremist elements grow.

‘So I think being engaged with the Syrian opposition is the right approach and that is an approach I know I share with the president and other colleagues in the European Union.’
