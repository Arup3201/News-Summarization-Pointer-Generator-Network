Labour has suspended Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins after the CPS launched a criminal investigation into leaked details of a death in custody

Labour has suspended its police and crime commissioner in Bedfordshire after the CPS considers criminal charges over the leaked details of a death in custody.

Olly Martins now faces the prospect of criminal charges after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced in February that it would investigate unauthorised disclosures about the death in custody of Leon Briggs.

Mr Briggs, 39, died on November 4 last
 year after he was restrained and detained by Bedfordshire Police 
officers and taken to Luton police station. His death is being probed by
 the IPCC in a separate investigation.

The IPCC said today that its completed investigation had been passed to prosecutors.

A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Olly Martins has been suspended from the Labour Party.'

The IPCC said in a statement: 'The Independent Police Complaints Commission has completed its investigation into the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Bedfordshire, Olly Martins, and has passed its report to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

'The CPS will determine whether there is evidence to warrant criminal charges.'

On February 13 this year, the IPCC said it would examine the unauthorised disclosure of information about the circumstances surrounding the death, adding that Mr Martins had admitted sharing information about the case with a third party, who then disclosed it to others.

Bedfordshire Police referred the leak to the IPCC in December last year after it was raised by a member of the public.

An initial probe by Bedfordshire's Police and Crime Panel resulted in a written warning to Mr Martins, issued at a private meeting in January.

The IPCC decided to launch an independent investigation in February, overseen by IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone.

Suspension from the Labour Party means Mr Martins is not allowed to participate in meetings or other party activities and he will be subject to a disciplinary proceeding run by the party's national executive committee.

The CPS will now look at the file and determine whether there is evidence to warrant criminal charges against Mr Martins.

Mr Briggs was arrested by officers after members of the public reported concerns about his behaviour.

He reportedly fell ill and was taken from the station to Luton and Dunstable Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The IPCC was alerted to the matter by Bedfordshire Police on December 1 following information from a member of the public.
