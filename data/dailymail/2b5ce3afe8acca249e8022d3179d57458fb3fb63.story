Outspoken: Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson will use a speech to attack a 'corrosive sense of entitlement' among voters

Almost nine in ten Scots receive more from the state than they pay in tax because of a ‘corrosive sense of entitlement’ north of the border, a top Tory said yesterday.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said it was ‘frightening’ only 283,080 households – 12 per cent of the total – pay more in taxes than they get back in public services.

She told the party’s annual conference in Birmingham that Scots are now so reliant on ‘the gangmaster state’ that the public sector accounts for more than half of the nation’s wealth.

Miss Davidson said the ‘rotten system’ of state patronage had been fuelled by Labour and the Nationalists.

The Scottish National Party, led by Alex Salmond, described her comments as her ‘Mitt Romney moment’. They said she had committed the same gaffe as the Republican presidential candidate, who was taped earlier this year appearing to write off the 47 per cent of Americans who pay no income tax.

Miss Davidson said a Tory revival in Scotland was being held back because of the public sector ‘stranglehold’, which means any party that seeks to reduce the size of the state cannot make progress.

‘The rotten system of patronage which denies so many people real choices in their lives has created a corrosive sense of entitlement which suits its political gangmasters,’ she said.

‘It is staggering that public sector expenditure makes up a full 50 per cent of Scotland’s gross domestic product and only 12 per cent of households are net contributors, where the taxes they pay outweigh the benefits they receive through public spending.

Policy: Davidson's views came as the Tory leadership announced more cuts to benefits

‘Only 12 per cent are responsible for generating Scotland’s wealth. There are people with household incomes of £50,000 who are paying tens of thousands of pounds in taxation and even that doesn’t cover the amount of money that government spends in their name.’

Anger: Leading SNP politician Kenny Gibson called it Davidson's 'Mitt Romney' moment and says she will have 'insulted' the whole country

She said it was ‘frightening’ that the average Scottish household consumed £14,151 more in public services every year than it pays in tax, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Those in the top 10 per cent pay £17,205 more in tax than they receive in public services. Miss Davidson added: ‘If the gangmaster state is the only provider people can see for their housing, education and employment, it’s no surprise those who seek to break the stranglehold find barriers in their way.’

Separate figures yesterday from the Centre for Policy Studies showed that – in Britain as a whole – 53.4 per cent of homes receive more in state benefits and services than they pay in taxes.

In 2001 – before Labour’s spending increase – the figure was less than 44 per cent. State benefits and services include unemployment and child benefits and health and education.

Describing Miss Davidson’s speech as her ‘Mitt Romney moment’, Kenny Gibson, an SNP member of the Scottish Parliament, said: ‘At least Mitt Romney only insulted around half of Americans.’
