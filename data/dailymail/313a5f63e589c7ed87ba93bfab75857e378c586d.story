A horse given a second chance when he was rescued from an abattoir has won a point-to-point race just 18 months later.

Oscar Flyer was saved by Valerie and Keith Welton, of Cattal, West Yorkshire, who paid just £300 for the injured steed - and were given £10 back for good luck.

The ex-hurdler, which formerly trained with Tim Vaughan, was coached back to health by their son Sam Welton, 25, and his 32-year-old partner Carolyn Woods.

And almost two years after he last competed, Oscar Flyer made a superb comeback and claimed the top spot at the South Durham Farmers three-mile point-to-point race on Sunday.

After dedicating the last 12 months to training him, Sam Welton rode Oscar Flyer to victory himself and the pair claimed the £150 prize money, recording the fastest time of the day.

He said: ‘It was my partner Carolyn who spotted Oscar Flyer for sale, but when she called me and suggested buying him I wasn’t too keen - he had a bad tendon injury.

‘We never expected this to happen. It is a feat in itself for a horse who has been off for two years to compete at all – we were hoping he would just make it all the way round.

‘I actually thought he was a bit of a cowardly horse but he proved not to be - he was really tough that day and battled it out to the line. He was brilliant.’

Winner: Mr Welton said that following the victory he wanted to have the horse racing again in about a month

In the stable: Oscar Flyer was put into a horse sale in Exeter, Devon, after suffering a bad leg injury. He was bought by a local slaughterman and destined to be put down after failing to sell

Oscar Flyer was put into a horse sale in Exeter, Devon, after suffering a bad leg injury. He was bought by a local slaughterman and destined to be put down after failing to sell.

But Miss Woods, who was at the sale, saw potential in the then six-year-old and thought he deserved a second chance - before her partner’s parents offered to pay for him.

Mr Welton and Miss Woods moved Oscar Flyer to their home in West Yorkshire and he spent a year recovering in a field before starting road work and training in September 2014.

Mr Welton said: ‘We always intended for him to race if his legs would hold out. But he would never have been destined for the same fate we saved him from.

'After this win we are hoping to have him racing again in about a month. We would definitely love to do the same with other horses in the future.’
