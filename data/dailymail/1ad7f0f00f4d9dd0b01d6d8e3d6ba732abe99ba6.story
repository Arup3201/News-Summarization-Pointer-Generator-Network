Andy Carroll was nowhere
 to be seen and new signing Mauro Zarate lasted just 33 minutes on his 
debut as West Ham were held to a 0-0 draw by Championship outfit Ipswich Town.

Sam Allardyce escaped the axe in the summer with promises to produce 'more entertaining' football, but a goalless draw does little to reassure West Ham owner, David Sullivan, who was in attendance at Portman Road.

Afterwards, though, Argentinian striker Zarate tweeted about his pelvis after worrying his new fans: 'Happy to have played my first match with the team. Positive match for me, I'm glad my pubis is well.'

Sullivan was there, looking animated throughout, but co-chairman David Gold was unable to reach the ground, having turned back after a four-lorry pile up at Dartford tunnel.

In his absence, though, West Ham dominated the opening exchanges with a strong starting XI. And Matt Jarvis was at the heart of the lot.

The winger first fed Carlton Cole to create a chance on the turn, before Jarvis's inch-perfect cross found Cheikhou Kouyate, whose header sailed over.

The 28-year-old, then, had a go himself, stretching to fashion a chance but missing the target.

It was encouraging, and new boy Aaron Cresswell almost haunted his former employers on his return.

The 24-year-old left goalkeeper Dean Gerken for dead with a deft job, but only saw it crash off the face of the crossbar on his old stomping ground.

At half time, the expected changes were made.

Among them was new signing Diego Poyet, who said he was 'glad to get another 45 minutes on the pitch'.

There was also Zarate, replacing Cole, but the striker's debut was short lived to say the least. The Argentinian forward from Velez Sarsfield lasted a little more than half an hour before going off.

West Ham tried to make the breakthrough in the second half but looked deflated, unable to crack Ipswich's code. Nevertheless, there were signs of encouragement from Kouyate and Co overall.

The 1,920 traveling fans will return to the capital pondering whether Allardyce can deliver the 'philosophy' the board are asking for, and wondering why Carroll was not included at all.

West Ham United joint-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said: 'We have a very clear vision of how we want West Ham United to operate under our joint ownership. Although not everybody understands the West Ham Way, we do and we respect it as we have been supporters all our lives. We believe this is about a philosophy that is not just about the style of play, but the whole ethos that surrounds the club.

'Sam was asked to give us a detailed presentation on his vision for next season and during this he assured us that he can deliver that ethos to West Ham United and we have agreed to support him with the resources that he needs. We have mapped out a way forward with him that will ensure our much-deserving fans have more to cheer about next season.

'We should also stress, though, that while improvements do need to be made, Sam deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing promotion in his first year and two respectable Premier League finishes in the two years thereafter.

'We have also seen the likes of Mark Noble, James Tomkins and Winston Reid all make huge progress under his management, which in turn contributed to our impressive record of 14 clean sheets last season.

'The truly historic opportunity of a move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016 forms a major part of our five-year strategy to take this club forward and, while we have a duty to make sure we stay in the Premier League, we also want to make sure the performances on the pitch will befit a team playing in such a world-renowned stadium.

'We are absolutely committed to taking West Ham United to new heights and we want to see the Club continue on an upward trajectory next season. The 2014-15 campaign is crucial to our future and we are confident that Sam has the passion, experience and determination to make sure it is a success.'

West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce said: 'I look forward to taking the club forward and improving the squad for next season to try and achieve the plans we have set out in our very productive meeting last week.'
