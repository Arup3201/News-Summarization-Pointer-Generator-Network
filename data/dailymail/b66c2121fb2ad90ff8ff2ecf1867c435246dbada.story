Ten-man Lazio held on to beat struggling AC Milan 1-0 on Tuesday and reach the Italian Cup semi-finals, putting Rossoneri coach Filippo Inzaghi's job in jeopardy.

In Serie A, Milan are 10th with a five-match winless streak and was beaten 3-1 by Lazio on Saturday.

Inzaghi, a former standout striker for Milan, is in his first season as a top-division coach, having previously managed the Rossoneri's youth side.

Lazio took the lead in the 38th with a penalty from Lucas Biglia after a hand ball by Michelangelo Albertazzi.

Lazio defender Lorik Cana was sent off for fouling Jeremy Menez from behind in the 45th, after a second bookable offence.

Milan had a goal from Giampaolo Pazzini waved off for a hand ball by the forward in the 69th.

Lazio then nearly doubled the lead when Keita Balde Diao hit the post in the 78th and another potential goal from Milan's Alessio Cerci was waved off for offside in added time.

In the semi-finals, Lazio will face the winner of next week's match between Inter Milan and Napoli.

In the other quarterfinals, it's Juventus versus Parma and Roma against Fiorentina.

At the San Siro, Lazio were in control from the start. Nine minutes in, striker Miroslav Klose took advantage of an errant pass from Ignazio Abate but missed the target.

Another defensive mistake set up a chance for Keita in the 15th but Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati charged forward to break the play up.

Earlier on Tuesday, Milan defender Philippe Mexes was banned for four matches for grabbing Lazio captain Stefano Mauri by the neck on Saturday.

On Monday, Milan reported that forward Stephan El Shaarawy broke a bone in his right foot at the end of Saturday's loss. The Italy striker will have to wear a brace for six weeks before beginning rehabilitation and could miss the rest of the season.
