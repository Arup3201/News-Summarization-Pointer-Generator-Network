A Cleveland policeman who fatally shot a 12-year-old thought the boy's pellet gun was a real firearm and later said he had no choice, the officer's father said.

The November 22 shooting of Tamir Rice by 26-year-old police rookie Tim Loehmann outside a recreation center sparked protests in the area.

Surveillance video shows Loehmann firing within two seconds of a patrol car stopping near Tamir, who reached in his waistband for what turned out to be a pellet gun.

Loehmann's father, Fred Loehmann, told Cleveland.com that the officer didn't know how young the boy was.

Loehmann revealed that his son initially was in shock after the shooting, but is now doing 'pretty well.' He also said his son is seeing his friends and going to church.

Fred Loehmann did reveal, however, that the family has received threats since police identified his son. 

'As soon as his name flashed on the screen [during the televised press conference], the phone started ringing,'  Loehmann told Cleveland.com. 'We had to turn our phones off.'

Tim Loehmann went to both Benedictine High School and Tiffin University, before leaving to attend Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland.com reported.

In high school, Loehmann was a marching band trumpet player, basketball scorekeeper, and German Club member - and in college was a basketball player and marching band trumpet player, according to the website. He also reportedly received a failure to control citation stemming from a traffic accident, and at age 17 had been charged with underage drinking.  

He was an officer with the Independence Police Department, then went to the Cleveland police academy before he started work in the Fourth District, Fred Loehmann told Cleveland.com. He also said his son became bored with being a police officer in suburban Independence.

Fred Loehmann is a veteran of both the NYPD and the U.S. Marshals Service, Cleveland.com reported. 

He told the news outlet that he understands something about the situation his son faced because of an experience he had during his own career in New York in 1972. He saw an armed robbery suspect with something silver in his hand but opted not to shoot, and it was revealed the item was actually a gun-shaped cigarette lighter, he said.

'If it would have been a real gun, I'd be dead,' he said.

New York police couldn't verify that information, but a spokesman confirmed to Cleveland.com that an F. Loehmann worked there for two decades.

The relatives of Tamir Rice declined to offer a comment to the media outlet regarding Loehmann's information, via a spokesperson for their lawyer David Malik.

His spokesperson Stan Donaldson reportedly said 'The family is grieving, as any family who lost a 12-year-old would be. They thought they would be spending this holiday with their son.'

Loehmann fired within 1½ to 2 seconds of pulling up in his cruiser, police said Wednesday. During those few moments, he ordered the Rice three times to put up his hands, they said.

The city released a surveillance video that shows the shooting of Rice, who was carrying an airsoft gun that shoots non-lethal plastic pellets.

Much of the footage shows what appears to be a bored kid alone in a park on an unseasonably warm November afternoon. Tamir is seen pacing, occasionally extending his right arm with what appears to be a gun in his hand, talking on a cellphone and sitting at a picnic table with his head resting on his arms.

The gun wasn't real. It can be bought at sporting goods stores for less than $20. Tamir's was lacking the bright orange tip that is usually put on such weapons to indicate they're not real guns.

Tamir's family said it has seen the video of his shooting.

'It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us,' the family said last week in a statement released by its attorneys. 'The video shows one thing distinctly: the police officers reacted quickly.'

Loehmann was identified last week on Wednesday as the patrol officer who shot Tamir. He is a 26-year-old rookie who began his career in Cleveland on March 3. He previously spent five months in 2012 with a department in suburban Independence, but four of those months were in that city's police academy.

Loehmann's partner that day was identified as Frank Garmback, 46. He has been with the department since 2008.

Loehmann and Garmback have come back to work following administrative leave and are not on patrol, Cleveland.com reported. 

The video police showed Wednesday had no sound and was choppy, showing about two frames per second. What is striking about it is the speed at which the shooting occurred.

At one moment, Tamir is sitting at a picnic table in a gazebo. He stands, and a police car zooms into the frame from the right and stops on the grass, just a few feet from him. The passenger door opens and Loehmann shoots Tamir before Garmback can get out the driver's side door.

It's unclear how far Tamir was from Loehmann when the officer shot him, but Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said it was less than 10 feet.

The low-resolution video shows Tamir reaching to his waistband and then bending over after being shot. His body is mostly obscured by the patrol car when he falls to the ground. Garmback can be seen walking around the car and kicking what is said to be the airsoft gun away from Tamir.

Remembered: A protester holds up  a picture of Tamir Rice, rookie police officer, during a protest in response to a grand jury's decision to not indict police officer Darren Wilson at the Department of Justice in D.C. 

Tomba told reporters at the news conference  on Wednesday that an FBI agent who was working a bank robbery detail nearby arrived within a few minutes and administered first aid to Tamir. Paramedics arrived three minutes later. The boy died on Sunday at a Cleveland hospital.

Tomba said the city was releasing the video at the behest of Tamir's family.

'This is not an effort to exonerate. It's not an effort to show the public that anybody did anything wrong,' Tomba said. 'This is an obvious tragic event where a young member of our community lost their life. We've got two officers that were out there protecting the public that just had to, you know, do something that nobody wants to do.'

On Saturday, a person had called 911 about a male pointing a gun at others at the park. The caller told the 911 dispatcher that the gun was 'probably fake,' then added, 'I don't know if it's real or not.'

Tomba would not discuss statements the two officers gave after the shooting, saying they were part of the investigation. Nor would he discuss details of the radio conversation between the officers and a dispatcher except to say they were apprised that they were on a 'gun run.'

The family thanked the city for releasing the video publicly and said it awaits the results of the police investigation.
