Having spent 40 years flitting between careers in law enforcement and journalism, Senior CBS News Correspondent John Miller is re-joining the NYPD to once again work with friend and mentor Bill Bratton.

Miller, who has worked at CBS since 2011, will return to the Department in a high-level counter-terrorism role, he announced on WCBS on Thursday afternoon.

Miller - who faced criticism for a recent 60 Minutes report that many thought was too soft on the NSA - served as the chief spokesperson for the NYPD from 1994-1995 after twenty years as a local journalist in New York City.

He then moved to ABC News for seven years before leaving to join the Los Angeles Police Department, followed by a stint as Assistant Director for Public Affairs at the FBI.

Miller will work underneath Bratton, the NYPD Commissioner.

Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio will be sworn in on Jan. 1 and has already tapped Bratton to once again lead the department.

Ray Kelly has served as police commissioner for the past 12 years under Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

As both a law enforcement agent and reporter, Miller has built a reputation as having an expertise in terrorism, even interviewing Osama bin Laden via video link in 1998.

At the time the interview didn't 'create many waves', however it was replayed constantly in the wake of 9/11.

In 2003 Miller joined the LAPD, working under Bratton, who was chief at the time, as the head of the Counterterrorism and Criminal Intelligence Bureau.

He oversaw the LAPD’S bomb squad, its major crimes division and its hazardous materials unit.

It was at the LAPD where Miller launched a system that helps to identify potential terrorist targets, according to CBS.

'The message going out from al Qaeda central is not ‘we need you to come here and train up in our camps and be deployed in our operations,’ he said on Thursday, in discussing his new role.

'The message going out is not from al Qaeda as much as it’s al Qaeda-ism, which is do what you can do with the resources you have.'

Miller said that while a terrorist attack similiar to September 11 is highly unlikely, al Qaeda are now focusing on low-cost, high-impact attacks, such as the Westgate shopping mall attack in Kenya, which killed 72 people.

Since joining CBS News in 2011, Miller has covered major stories like the Times Square bomb plot, the Boston Marathon bombings and the Newtown school shooting, for which CBS will be awarded the prestigious duPont-Columbia award for breaking news coverage.
