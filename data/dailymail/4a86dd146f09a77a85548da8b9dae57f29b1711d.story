An Oklahoma man has become the second person to die in the U.S. of the new 'Heartland' virus which is carried by ticks.

The Department of Health said the man, who is over 65, was from Delaware County in north-east Oklahoma and died from complications from the virus.

The virus is found in the lone star tick and is spread through tick bites.

It was first identified in Missouri in 2009.

The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has said the other patient who died had other health conditions.

Other cases have been diagnosed in Missouri and Tennessee but those patients have recovered.

Similar to previous cases, the Oklahoma victim had a history of outdoor activities and exposure, said Becky Coffman, an epidemiologist in acute disease with the Oklahoma Health Department.

Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headaches, muscle aches, loss of appetite, nausea, bruising easily and diarrhea.

The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, is found throughout the eastern, southeastern and south-central states.

They have been recorded in large numbers as far north as Maine and as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma.

All three life stages (larva, nymph, adult) of the lone star tick will feed on humans, and may be quite aggressive.

Lone star ticks will also feed readily on other animals, including dogs and cats, and may be brought into the home on pets.

The saliva from lone star ticks can be irritating; redness and discomfort at a bite site does not necessarily indicate an infection.

People should monitor their health closely after any tick bite, and should consult their physician if they experience a rash, fever, headache, joint or muscle pains, or swollen lymph nodes within 30 days of a tick bite.

These can be signs of a number of tickborne diseases.

There is no vaccine or drug to prevent or treat the illness.

Since its discovery, the Heartland Virus has killed two people and infected eight others.

Coffman said people who become ill after spending a lot of time outdoors should disclose to physicians if they have a history of tick bites to help reach a correct diagnosis.

The incubation period before the onset of symptoms of the Heartland virus is unknown but symptoms caused by other tick-borne illnesses generally begin two weeks after infection, Coffman said.

'We need to help doctors,' she said. 'We need to give them as much information as we can to give them some clues.'

Coffman said campers and others who spend a lot of time outdoors should check themselves 'at least daily' for ticks.

Although there is no routine testing available for Heartland virus, protocols are in place for investigational diagnostic testing.

The state Health Department recommends using insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers when outdoors, avoiding bushy and wooded areas where ticks thrive and conducting thorough tick checks after spending time outside.

'They can cause a lot of damage,' said Dr Kathryn Zackery, of the Sapulpa Indian Health Center.

According to Dr Zackery, Sapulpa patients visit the health center during the spring and summer months. 

'We saw cases several times per week last summer,' she said.

Heartland virus belongs to a family of viruses called Phleboviruses. Viruses in this family are found all over the world. 

Some of these viruses can cause people to get sick. Most of the phleboviruses that cause people to become ill are passed through the bite of a mosquito, tick, or sandfly.

It is not yet fully known how people become infected with Heartland virus.

However, recent studies suggest that ticks, namely Lone Star ticks, may transmit the virus.

As of March 2014, eight cases of Heartland virus disease had been identified among residents of Missouri and Tennessee.

Since the Heartland virus was first described in 2012 and there have only been a few cases, scientists are still learning about it.

So far, all patients diagnosed with Heartland virus disease became sick during May-September.

They all had a fever and felt very tired. Some also complained of headaches, muscle aches, diarrhea, losing their appetite, or feeling sick to their stomach.

They all had low numbers of cells that fight infection and that help blood clot.

Most patients required hospitalisation for their illness. Most patients fully recovered, but now two patients have died.

People who work or do activities outside, where they are exposed to ticks or insects, may be more likely to be infected.

There is no vaccine or drug to prevent or treat the disease. Preventing bites from ticks and mosquitoes may prevent this and other infections.
