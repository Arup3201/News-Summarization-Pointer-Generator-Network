Tragic: Drake Smith Jr, four, who died after he 
was nfected by the Naegleria fowleri microbe while playing on a 
waterslide at a home in Louisiana

A rare brain-eating amoeba that killed a four-year-old in Louisiana may be on the rise as a result of Hurricane Katrina, experts have said.

Drake Smith Jr, from Mississipi, is believed to have been infected by the Naegleria fowleri microbe while playing on a Slip'N'Slide toy at a home in St Bernard Parish.

Tissue tests by the Centers for Disease Control later revealed he died from a form of encephalitis after the amoeba entered his body through his nose and attacked his brain.

Experts say the N. fowleri amoeba is 
spreading through the area's water supply because a drastic drop in 
population following Hurricane Katrina has left much of its water 
stagnant.

Just south-west 
of New Orleans, St Bernard Parish was one of the areas most badly 
affected by the hurricane which smashed the U.S. Gulf coast eight years 
ago.

Jake Causey, 
chief engineer for Louisiana's health and hospitals, told CNN: 'One of 
the concerns is that it was such a drastic population drop after Katrina
and the water aged ... just by sitting in the pipes and also a drop in 
lower demand.

'The more quickly it [the water] is used up, the more the water system is able to process a good chlorine system.'

Most
often found in hot springs and warm fresh water across the 
south-eastern U.S., N. fowleri enters the body through the nose and 
travels to the brain.

There
is no danger of infection from drinking or cooking with contaminated 
water, a point proved by a St Bernard Parish official who drank tap 
water drawn from the district earlier this week.

State epidemiologist Dr Raoult Ratard 
earlier this week told Reuters that Naegleria fowleri infections are 
rare, though the amoeba itself is not.

Studies
have shown that the amoeba exists 'in very low numbers' in about 40 per
cent of water supplies in the developed world, he said.

He
said the amoeba likely multiplied in the St. Bernard water system 
because the chlorine level in some locations fell below the 0.5 
milligrams per liter standard by the CDC.

Dr
Peralta said that St Bernard Parish is continuing to flush its water 
system and add chlorine to ensure that the water is safe for drinking 
and bathing.

While communities that lie near St. Bernard Parish have their own, separate water supplies, some are seeking assurances that their water is safe.

Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said parish employees flushed the water lines over the weekend and he has asked the state health department to test the parish's water system.

'The steps we are taking are purely precautionary measures,' he said.
