Leicester City have opened an investigation into the altercation between manager Nigel Pearson and some of his own club's fans in Tuesday night's defeat by Liverpool.

Leicester remained bottom of the table after a 3-1 defeat to the Merseyside club at the King Power Stadium.

Pearson opts to sit amongst the fans instead of occupying the touchline, but with the club struggling in the league it left him exposed to criticism and in a heated exchange he hit back.

A Leicester City spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident that took place during Tuesday night's match and are looking into the matter to establish a full and accurate account of proceedings.

'Once the facts have been determined and suitably corroborated, we will decide what next steps, if any, should be taken.'

After the 3-1 loss on Tuesday, Pearson hit out at the 'irritating' pundits on Sky Sports along with some of Leicester's supporters.  

The Foxes' boss saw his side surrender a lead against the Reds, a result which leaves them rooted to the foot of the Premier League table. 

And Pearson was clearly irked in the immediate aftermath when addressing the problems at his door.

Pearson: 'I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn't like what he sees, then don't bother coming'

He admitted to telling one fan not to bother returning to the King Power Stadium if they aren't prepared to show support.

Pearson  positions himself in the stands, where he is surrounded by supporters, instead of on the touchline because the 51-year-old feels it gives him a better tactical point of view.

But the manager was subject to criticism on Tuesday.

'I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn't like what he sees, then don't bother coming,' Pearson told SkySports.

'Maybe they ought to think about staying at home, we need support their support. We've worked hard tonight and will continue to do so.'

Jordan Henderson was on the spot to score after Raheem Sterling's clever back heel to wrap things up

And he then turned on the broadcaster in his press conference, saying: 'I find some of the - I don't know what you call them - presenters are particularly irritating.' 

It was Leicester's second defeat in four days after last year's Championship winners  were beaten 3-2 by Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Saturday.

Pearson's men visit Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday, who recorded their first win since September 13 with a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Tuesday.
