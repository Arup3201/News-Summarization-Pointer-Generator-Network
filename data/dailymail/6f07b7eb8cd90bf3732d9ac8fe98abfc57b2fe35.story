'Ticking timebomb': RBS chief executive Mr Hester, who earns £1.2million a year and is pictured today, said the spotlight the bank has been put under has made his job more difficult

Royal Bank of Scotland chief-executive Stephen Hester said today it would have been 'indulgent' to resign in a row over his £1million bonus.

Mr Hester - who earns £1.2million a year - said pay fairness should not be achieved by 'cutting down success.'

He caved in and waived a near £1million performance payout for 2011 after intense public and political pressure.

Mr Hester said he surrendered the bonus - to be paid in shares - because of the damage the row was doing to the bank.

Speaking publicly for the first time after the furore, he suggested it would have been an easy decision to walk out of the bank once his bonus came under threat.

Mr Hester told BBC Radio 4's Today 
programme: 'I am not a robot and there has been some deeply depressing 
moments over the last three years.

'In the end, I came to the conclusion that it would be indulgent for me to resign.'

He said he 'drew on inner strength' to continue at the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer.

Mr
Hester added he had been tasked with 'defusing a ticking timebomb' and the spotlight placed on him made the job more difficult.

The 51-year-old said it was wrong to attack successful people - although added that what bankers are paid is a political decision.

'I believe strongly in issues to do with equality of opportunity. I believe in a progressive tax system - I have no problem in paying more tax,' he said.

'But I don't think cutting off success or cutting down success is the way to go about fairness in society.'

He caved in and surrendered his bonus after Labour’s announced it would force a Commons debate on the payments at the bank, allowing MPs to vote on the bonus.

Stephen Hester may have waived his £963,000 shares bonus - but he could still walk away with £39m during his time at RBS.

The bank had already set aside £3.3million for Mr Hester’s bonus next year.

That is on top of the potential £35.5million package he has enjoyed since he moved to RBS in 2008.

It is made up of pay, pension, bonuses, shares and a long-term incentive plan that is worth up to £4.8million a year, four times his £1.2million basic salary, and is due to start paying out from 2014 if he hits certain targets.

This is how it is calculated:

2008: £4.99million in shares instead of pay and bonuses;

2009: £6.9million total package; 

2010: £8.16million total package;

2011: £8.08million total package;

2012: £7.38million total, including up to £4.8million long-term incentive plan, salary of £1.2million, £420,000 in pension contributions and his bonus which was worth £963,000 when issued last week but was expected to top £1million as RBS shares rise in value. The bonus has, of course, now been waived.

2013: RBS have set aside £3.3million of shares for his bonus next year. The exact size will be decided this time next year.

Mr Hester’s shares-only 
payment was worth around £963,000, but he could yet pocket as much as 
£39million in total during his time with RBS.

The bank had already set aside £3.3million for Mr Hester’s bonus next year.

He said he surrendered the 2011 payment because it was hurting the bank.

'I took the judgment that it was 
going to be damaging for RBS to stay in the intensity of the spotlight 
that we had got into,' he said.

Mr Hester spoke publicly for the 
first time about his decision to waive his bonus today after revealing 
to staff that the restructuring of RBS has already cost £38billion.

The money has gone on disposing of assets, loan losses and restructuring charges.

The Government's stake in the bank cost £45billion and the final cost of the restructuring could yet surpass this.

Mr Hester said today that while he had 'great sympathy and understanding' for people concerned about the high rewards in the banking industry, such 'societal issues' were ultimately a matter for politicians.

He said it was essential that RBS was able to recruit the best people to resolve the problems it had inherited from the former management, which led to it being bailed out by the taxpayer.

'When I was asked to take on this job three years ago, I had to replace the whole senior management team of RBS,' he said.

'We had to go around the world looking for the best people, not just people to run a bank well, but people to defuse the biggest timebomb in history in terms of bank balance sheets.

'Those people are doing a good job. I think they deserve recognition. If they do a good job, it is our task to make sure that there is a connection between the job people are doing and how they get treated.'

Fat cats: Mr Hester's near £1million bonus payout for 2011 sparked a public and political outcry

Mr Hester acknowledged that bank bonuses were controversial but said RBS had not realised what a storm his award would create.

'I understand why these issues are controversial - particularly in a time of austerity. Of course, we underestimated that, going forward,' he said.

He admitted the banks had been guilty of 'hubris' after 20 years of 'unbridled expansion' leading up to the crash of 2008.

'I think in the case of the banking industry there was over-confidence and, with the benefit of hindsight, over-rewards,' he said.

However he warned it was important not to 'demonise' a sector which remained essential to the economy.

'Let's not demonise a whole industry. Let's not demonise something that is fundamental to the world economy,' he said.

'Banking is important, financial services is important. It supports the economy, it supports millions of jobs and we need to remember that.'

While he acknowledged that as a largely state-owned organisation, RBS would be held to a higher standard than other banks, he said it could not be treated completely differently.

'It may make our job more difficult. We have to try to behave in a way that also leads on some of these difficult issues of how we interact with society,' he said.

'We can't be completely different from all the people against who we compete but I accept that we need to have a sensitivity.'

He added: 'We would make a mistake as a society if we forget how wealth is generated, how successful people are motivated.'

Stripped: Fred Goodwin today faced calls to be stripped of this honorary degree he received from St Andrews University

Fred Goodwin should be stripped of his honorary degree, students at a top university said today.

The former RBS chief - stripped of his knighthood last week - was made a Doctor of Laws by St Andrews University in Scotland in 2004.

But the Students' Association has now called for the university to revoke the degree because of his role in the collapse of Britain's biggest bank.

President Patrick O'Hare said: 'We believe that keeping in place an honorary degree for someone like Fred Goodwin runs contrary to the values of the University of St Andrews.

'Fred Goodwin, of course, is not solely responsible for the banking crisis although his awards were made for ‘services to banking' - a statement which has no foundation.

'Fred ‘the Shred' has, over the course of the banking crisis, become a symbol of arrogance, misjudgement and greed which many people feel has become endemic within our banking system.

'To defend the award devalues our system of honorary graduates such as Sir David Attenborough and Sir Peter Lampl who have gained one through their contributions to society.

'If the Queen and the Forfeiture Committee can take the extraordinary measure of revoking his knighthood, then it seems fairly obvious that the university can do the same with his honorary degree.'

But a university spokesman insisted that Goodwin was given an honorary degree in 'good faith' and there were no plans to remove it.

He added: 'Clearly, a great deal has changed since that time. The university is very sensitive to the varied opinions expressed about Mr Goodwin's part in the collapse of RBS and its damaging effects on the economy and the lives of many thousands of people.

'Revoking the degree, however, cannot change history, nor ameliorate the harm done by by the banking collapse, for which many people and institutions, not just the one man, are responsible.

'In these circumstances, the university will not be pressured into making the precipitate gesture of revoking Mr Goodwin's degree.'
