While they have helped thousands find both long-term love and short term flings, dating apps have created almost as many problems as they have solved.

From a constant barrage of seedy messages (and pictures) from shady characters, to meeting up with people who clearly took their picture when New Kids On The Block were still in the charts, navigating your way through the world of dating apps can leave you feeling rather sour.

But a new app, created by two women, promises to put an end to these dating woes by putting women in control of the dating scene.

Two Cambridge graduates have invented a dating app called Antidate that makes women invisible until THEY decide to make a move. They can also use the app to locate a hot man geographically

Antidate allows women to remain anonymous, entirely unseen by the men in their vicinity until they choose to contact them. 

Women can look at the profiles of men near their location and decide who is their type while staying completely invisible. 

This means they can avoid both creeps and wasting time talking to people who you will never 'click' with.

The woman can then initiate contact by either 'tapping' a man, or start messaging him, at which point he can see her profile and location.

As well as being linked to a person's Instagram account, members on Antidate must also submit a time-stamped verified profile picture to ensure that people actually look similar to how they present themselves.

Avoiding time-wasting is also a big selling point of Antidate, as messages are deleted after just 24 hours. As well as being linked to a person's Instagram account, members on Antidate must also submit a time-stamped verified profile picture to ensure that people actually look similar to how they present themselves

The app is the brainchild of Cambridge graduates Hatty Kingsley-Miller, 33, and Mo Saha,34, who first met at senior school in south London.  

Speaking to FEMAIL, Hatty said: 'We were single when we started work on the app - it was before Tinder and so online dating was really big on places like match.com. 

'We really thought at the time that online dating could be a more fun experience for people than it was, we wanted to do something that was less of a pain.

'I think anyone who has dabbled in online dating has experienced the dates where you meet them and they look at least four years older than their photo.'

She continued: 'You know from the split second that you meet them at the tube station if they are a no or a yes, so with with this app we were trying to replicate meeting in a bar instead - with the minimum invested time beforehand that now always comes with messaging for weeks.'

Mo added that the anonymity feature is also a huge plus for both women and men. 

She said: 'We imported one of the key features from Grindr that shows where people on the app are in London. Except only the women can see the men. 

'So, if a girl can see there are loads of hot guys in Soho, then they can go and meet them there. 

'It's bringing it back to the basics again.'
