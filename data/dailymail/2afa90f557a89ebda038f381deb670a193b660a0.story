Israeli intelligence spied on US Secretary of State John Kerry during failed peace talks with Palestinians and Arab states last year, it has been claimed.

As well as Israel, at least one other intelligence service listened to Mr Kerry's telephone calls during a key period of negotiations in 2013, according to the German magazine Der Spiegel.

The revelations come as relations between the US and Israel remain tense and amid criticism of Mr Kerry's diplomatic efforts in recent weeks.

Neither Washington nor Jerusalem has commented on the claims in the magazine, which says its information came from 'reliable sources'.

Mr Kerry had been speaking regularly with 'high-ranking negotiating partners' in the Middle East at the time of the alleged eavesdropping - and some of them were intercepted, according to the report.

A number of the calls were allegedly made on normal telephones - rather than encrypted equipment – and would have been transmitted by satellite.

'The government in Jerusalem then used the information obtained in international negotiations aiming to reach a diplomatic solution in the Middle East,' it added.

Intensive efforts to reach a diplomatic solution ultimately failed last year and relations between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mr Kerry worsened.

Last week, the Obama administration hit back at a torrent of Israeli criticism over the Secretary of State's latest bid to secure a cease-fire with Hamas, accusing some in Israel of launching a 'misinformation campaign' against the diplomat.

In recent weeks, Israeli media reports have cast Mr Kerry as seeking a cease-fire that is more favorable to Hamas and being dismissive of key Israeli concerns. 

Some commentators attacked his attempts to bring Qatar and Turkey - two countries viewed by Israel as strong Hamas supporters - into the cease-fire negotiations.

Kerry was also accused of abandoning some of Israel's key demands during the negotiations, including demilitarizing Gaza. 

Kerry himself, in a speech to the Center for American Progress, noted the criticism but did not give ground.

'Make no mistake, when the people of Israel are rushing to bomb shelters, when innocent Israeli and Palestinian teenagers are abducted and murdered, when hundreds of innocent civilians have lost their lives, I will and we will make no apologies for our engagement,' he said.
