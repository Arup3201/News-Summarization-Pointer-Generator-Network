The youngest son of civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is selling up his mansion in Malibu.

Dexter Scott King, 54, who is the chairman of the King Center  - a group of several historic buildings in Atlanta that operate as museums telling his late father's story - has listed his four-bedroom abode for $4.85 million.

King - who also played his father in the 2002 TV movie, The Rosa Parks Story, and wrote a book about his slaying, Growing Up King: An Intimate Memoir - splits his time between California and Atlanta. 

He bought the well-secured house in 2006 for $4.16 million, according to The Los Angeles Times. 

With expansive ocean views, the domicile has six bathrooms, a two-car garage and a pool with a cabana, waterfall and koi pond.

The property measures at more than an acre, with plenty of lush gardens.
