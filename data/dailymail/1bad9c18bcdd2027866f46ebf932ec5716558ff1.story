This clip captures a woman's disastrous attempts to line up her car with the fuel cap at a petrol station.

And embarrassingly, it takes her an astonishing five attempts to park her car with the cap on the correct side. 

Captured on CCTV footage, a security worker can be heard laughing as he records the woman make blunder after blunder.

The woman driver comes into the petrol station and quickly realises her fuel cap is on the wrong side

The clip, posted on YouTube, has racked up more than six million views in less than four days. 

It begins as the woman drives into a station in Leicester and emerges from her vehicle only to spot the cap is on the wrong side.

But hilariously, she drives around and emerges again on the wrong side, repeatedly failing to spot her mistake.

It takes five tries over a three-minute period for the woman to realise her error, perform a three-point turn and finally fill up her tank.

But at least she got there in the end. 

She proceeds to drive around to the other side, only to come out and realise her cap is still on the wrong side

Third time lucky? She comes around yet again but still doesn't spot the problem

The footage, captured on CCTV, shows her go around a third time and a security work can be heard giggling

Her fourth attempt is yet another fail, but her amusing blunder racked up six million views on YouTube

But the fifth time proved the charm as the woman finally spots her mistake and does a three-point turn
