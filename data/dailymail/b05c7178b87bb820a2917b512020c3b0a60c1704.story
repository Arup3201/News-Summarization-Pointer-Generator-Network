TV presenter Alan Titchmarsh yesterday entered the ageism debate about the lack of older women on television with a thinly-veiled blast at the fairer sex.

The celebrity gardener, 64, suggested many women used their good looks to boost their careers in their youth and called for ‘less whingeing’ about the issue of the ages of TV stars.

Titchmarsh - a charming housewives’ favourite for years - said: ‘Men in television tend to last a bit longer at the end of their careers, but it is women who make hay at the beginning. They don’t complain in their early days when they are disporting themselves on sports cars.’

He added: ‘I’d like to see a mix of all ages on TV and wish there could be less whingeing about it.’

Cut: Former newsreader Anna Ford left the BBC claiming she had been sidelined because of her age

The comments in an interview with the Observer are likely to rekindle the debate over broadcasting ageism.

Last month a new study revealed fewer than one in five presenters at major broadcasters over the age of 50 were women.

Overall women over 50 make up just 5% of on-screen presenters of all ages and both sexes.

The row began when former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly won an age discrimination employment tribunal case against the BBC in 2011 after she was dropped from the rural affairs show when it moved to a primetime slot.

She was 52 at the time and returned to work at the BBC, but later said the apologies and offers of work were ‘clearly just a PR damage limitation exercise.’

Several other high-profile female 
presenters have complained about their treatment by TV companies once 
they have reached a certain age.

Selina Scott was awarded £250,000 after she sued Channel 5 for ageism in 2008 when she was 57.

While Anna Ford left the BBC in 2006 aged 62, claiming she has been sidelined because of her age.

In
 the wake of a multi-million pound contract for David Dimbleby two years
 ago, Ford said: ‘I wonder how these charming dinosaurs such as Mr 
Dimbleby and John Simpson continue to procure contracts with the BBC, 
when, however hard I look, I fail to see any woman of the same age, the 
same intelligence and the same rather baggy looks.’

Last month actress Julie Walters also accused broadcasters of ageism, commenting: ‘We’ll always have to campaign against why, for instance, older men on TV news programmes tend to be paired up with younger women. Where’s Anna Ford is what I say.’

O’Reilly, who is now hoping to become a Labour MP at the next election, said: ‘The broadcasters say they are committed to the fair representation of older women, but the figures don’t bear that out.’
