Wrestling star Kevin Nash, 55, was taken into custody in Volusia County, Florida after cops were called about a domestic dispute shortly after midnight.

According to a police report, Kevin Nash told authorities that his son Tristen, 18, came home and started acting aggressively towards he and his wife.

Kevin Nash says that Tristen 'spit in his face and elbow-checked him.'

Kevin says that's when he pinned his 6'5" 200 lbs son to the floor and his son scratched his face in retaliation.

Tristen reportedly told police that his dad was yelling at him about the relationship he had with his girlfriend and that it escalated into violence.

Tristen says his father used his signature wrestling move to slam his head to the ground so hard that he blacked out.

In a strange twist, two hours after Tristen was arrested, police got a 911 call from Tristen's uncle who claims Tristen was drunk and that he 'slung his mom around the kitchen' and that he also tried attacking him.

Both men were arrested for battery and are being held at a nearby jail without bail.

Kevin Nash  has been in 'Magic Mike' and will be in the sequel as well. He's also been in 'John Wick,' 'Rock of Ages,' 'The Longest Yard,' and in 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze.' 

Nash who stands at 6'1 and weighs 277 lbs has won 21 wrestling championships using his famous move the jackknife power-bomb.
