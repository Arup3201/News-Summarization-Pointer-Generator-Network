Felix Magath lasted just 18 games in charge of Fulham before being sacked by the Championship strugglers

Former Fulham defender Brede Hangeland was advised to put cheese on his injured thigh to speed up the healing process by Felix Magath

'The club doctor, who is no longer at the club, who I know well didn't think it was the best idea, but Brede did it regardless. 

'It's one of many ridiculous sad stories that we've heard about Felix that has ultimately cost him his job and put Fulham in a world of trouble because all the good and experienced players they were here were desperate to leave because of it and did.'

Magath was sacked by Fulham on Wednesday with the west Londoners rock bottom of the Championship. He managed just three wins in his 18 games in charge of the club.

Magath hit back at the claims telling German news magazine Focus that 'he would never prescribe the way for a physician to treat a player in what he has to do'.
