Apple will unveil the iPhone 6 in mid-September - but may hold back the larger of the two models.

The handset will be available in two sizes - a 4.7inch and 5.5inch version.

The event will showcase at least the new iPhone 6 with a 4.7-inch screen, but a final decision on debuting the larger, 5.5-inch 'phablet' model at the event has not been made, according to 9to5mac.

Suppliers claim Apple has ordered between 70 and 80 million units combined for its rumoured, upcoming 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s (leaked images pictured) by 30 December. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets

Although smartwatches are a relatively new tech trend, Apple was working on a version as far back as 2011, according to its latest patent.

The files detail a wristband fitted with a detachable electronic touchscreen device.

The shape and size of the device in the patent images resembles a sixth-generation iPod Nano and in one design, the word iTime is written on its face.

'Apple is gearing up for its first major hardware and software launches of 2014,' the site says.

'The Cupertino-based company is 'tentatively' planning a keynote address in mid-September to announce the iPhone 6 and provide final details on iOS 8, according to sources briefed on the plans.'

However, the site also admitted the plans are 'in flux'.

Apple is said to be so confident its upcoming iPhone 6 will be a success, it is rumoured to have ordered 80 million handsets by the end of the year.

If true, this would be the largest initial production run of iPhones – up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S and 5C last year.

Suppliers claim the Californian firm has asked for between 70 and 80 million units combined for the rumoured 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s by 30 December.

The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the new gadgets.

The 4.7-inch iPhone is
 expected to go into production next week, with the larger 5.5inch version 
set to start three weeks later.

Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display.

By increasing the size of its iPhone 6 handsets, Apple phones will be closer in size to those made by rival Samsung and HTC.

Sources 'familiar with the matter' said: 'The different timetables have been set as Apple does not want to repeat the mistake it made in 2013 when it launched the iPhone 5S (pictured front) and iPhone 5C (pictured back) simultaneously'

Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures.

As
 the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced 
using diamond-coated saws.

These round disks are ground into shape, and 
polished, to become glass.

The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant.

Apple already uses sapphire crystal in 
the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera.

As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones.

Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal
 display.

Current models have a separate touchscreen layer.

Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal, rather than glass.

Due to the complex nature of these screens, reports claim Apple could even ask component makers to prepare for 120 million displays, to account for any faults and replacements that need to be issued.

The Economic Daily said earlier this week Foxconn finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff.

The report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger 'phablet' sized iPhone 6 won't ship until 2015.

A
 YouTube videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the sapphire screens - and has
 subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and 
keys to bending and twisting it.

In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed, raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple.

Marques
 Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claims to have got the screen from 
well known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video 
showcasing the screen.

In the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen.

'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said.

'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.'

The
 glass is also extremely high-quality, Brownlee noted: 'There’s 
absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass.'

Apple
 already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and
 camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front 
display is made of Gorilla Glass.

Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display. Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of strong and resilient sapphire crystal - shown here being stabbed with a knife

IDozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6.

They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back.

However,
 a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product 
will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen.

Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone
