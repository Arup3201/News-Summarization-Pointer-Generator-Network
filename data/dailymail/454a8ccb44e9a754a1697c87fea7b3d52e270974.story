The home town celebration for Sgt Bowe Bergdahl may have been cancelled amid the furor of the POW's controversial release but there is one person looking forward to his return to Hailey, Idaho, at least.

Actor Dawson Howard was pictured posing next to a ‘Bowe is Coming Home’ sign he helped make - but was last year found guilty of sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl.

The 33-year-old registered sex offender, 
who worked with Bergdahl at a restaurant in Hailey, was accused of rape 
and lewd conduct in connection with the teenager in 2011.

Busted: While Bowe Bergdahl was in captivity, pal avoided serving time after pleading guilty to a felony

A town divided: The town of Hailey is relieved that Bowe Bergdahl is coming home, but just how he should be welcomed became a huge controversy. In the end, the mayor decided to cancel a planned public celebration

But after making a plea deal with prosecutors the two sex crimes were dropped and Howard agreed to plead guilty to a single felony offense of sexual abuse of a child under 16.

Blaine County Sheriff Gene Ramsey said Howard's relationship with the young girl dated back to 2008, when he was a camp counselor and the victim was enrolled in a local drama camp at St. Thomas Playhouse.

The sheriff said Howard began an 'online relationship' with the girl in July 2011 and that he had sex with her about a month later.

'On August 
20, he allegedly picked up the 14-year-old girl at a parking lot in Sun 
Valley and drove her to a house in Ketchum where he was house-sitting,' 
Ramsey said.

At
 a sentencing hearing at Blaine County 5th District Court in October 
last year, Judge Robert J. Elgee gave Howard a six-year suspended prison
 sentence.

Hanging tough: Bowe, who worked in a local restaurant with Howard, went paragliding in Sun Valley, a few miles north of Hailey, in 2005. He was fit as a fiddle then

He also imposed a $1,000 fine and ordered a $5,000 civil penalty to be paid to the victim. 

At sentencing, Hailey attorney Douglas Werth, assigned as public defender, noted that Howard had no prior criminal history.  'He
 has accepted that what he did was wrong. He’s admitted the sexual 
contact he had with this girl and he’s willing to participate in 
sex-offender treatment.'

Sgt. 
Bergdahl, meanwhile, is still being debriefed about his ordeal in 
Germany. Unlike his relatively fit appearance on the day of his release,
 CBS
 reports that in the proof-of-life video sent to the US  last January 
the POW stuttered when he spoke, held his arm in such a way that it 
looked injured and appeared thin.

Photos obtained by MailOnline prior to his captivity show him to be a robust athlete involved in many pursuits.

Bergdah's release has been shrouded in controversy as accusations of his defection from his unit continue to mar his return.

Twinkle toes: Bowe was a serious student of the ballet before he left  for the Army. He took lessons at the Sun Valley Ballet School

A public welcome home celebration featuring Grammy-winning singer Carole King in honor of freed POW Bowe Bergdahl in the tiny town of Hailey, Idaho was abruptly cancelled this week.The official reason given was a concern for public safety, but MailOnline learned that it was not the only reason the party was scrubbed.

Today's decision follows a row that erupted in Hailey between Mayor Fritz Haemmerle and US Army Platoon Commander Jonathan Kennedy, who lives in Hailey.

In an email to Mayor Haemmerle - seen by MailOnline - former US Army platoon leader Jonathan Kennedy said: ‘If Individual members of the community wish to hold sedate, private celebrations to commemorate Bowe Bergdahl's homecoming, they are of course free and welcome to do so.

It would be, however, a monstrous profanity if a public ceremony, financed by public money, were to be held.

Howard, however.  was 
thrilled when he heard of Bergdahl’s release on Saturday and has been 
seen out on Main Street in Hailey discussing the good news.

He even helped make signs and banners outside local shops to celebrate the soldier's return.

He
 told reporters he used to work with Bergdahl in a local restaurant in 
Hailey years ago adding: 'I'm happy to hear he was freed.'

Up until his arrest Howard was known in Hailey and wider Wood River Valley area for having appeared in numerous theatrical and musical productions.

He had a leading role in a nexStage Theatre production of the Shakespeare comedy “Twelfth Night” and it’s believed he also knew Bergdahl through his dancing at Sun Valley Ballet School.
