When Eric Kingston saw a group of young men clambering on to a roof, he was convinced they were trying to burgle the property.

But instead of immediately calling the police, he grabbed an air rifle and in a ‘moment of madness’ opened fire.

It was only after he wounded two of the four men that he discovered they were not a crime gang but a group of free runners innocently performing their sport.

Shot: Foreman Eric Kingston, 47, opened fire with a .22 air rifle after the group of 'parkour' enthusiasts scaled a scaffolding rig. He pleaded guilty to two counts of actual bodily harm yesterday

Wounded: Free runner Max Cave's injuries from the shooting (left) and Luke Harty's bloodied arm (right). The men had to have the pellets dug out of their skin

Kingston, 47, was jailed for a year 
after a court heard that he continued firing even when the group 
pleaded: ‘Don’t shoot – we’re not robbing anything.’

Max Cave and Luke Harty were left bleeding from pellet wounds.

They had been free running with fellow devotees Maza Shabazz and Ryan Walsh when the incident happened in August.

Opened fire: Eric Kingston has been jailed for 12 months for shooting at two 'parkour' enthusiasts, even as they begged him to stop

The sport involves climbing and jumping between urban structures and was developed from the French craze parkour.

The four men had scaled scaffolding at
 Ryman stationers in Horsham, West Sussex, before resting on the roof of
 the three-storey building.

As they enjoyed the view Mr Cave, 20, 
was shot in the abdomen by Kingston, who was leaning out of the window 
of a nearby building brandishing a .22 air rifle, Brighton Law Courts 
heard.

Mr Cave pleaded with Kingston to stop but the building site foreman continued to fire, hitting Mr Harty, 19, in the back.

Both victims suffered puncture wounds.

They had lead pellets removed and needed a course of antibiotics, the court heard.

Father-of-two Kingston, from Horsham, admitted two counts of causing bodily harm.

He apologised and said he was ‘genuinely fearful’ that the group of men, who were dressed in leisure wear, would overpower him.

He was jailed for 12 months for what was described to the court as a ‘moment of madness’.

Luke Harty said: 'All I felt was the pain, and I heard the noise. I looked down and I was bleeding, and I had no idea why'

Judge Paul Tain said despite 
Kingston’s previous good character he would be ‘failing in his public 
duty’ if he did not jail him.

‘One of your victims said “You can’t shoot
 at people” and that is probably the simplest and most accurate 
expression of this case,’ he said.

‘You should have closed the window and called the police.

‘That’s what ordinary law-abiding 
people do who are not overreacting. Anything beyond that is taking the 
law into your own hands.’

It would be improper to impose 
anything other than an immediate custodial sentence, he added.

The popularity of free running, or 'parkour', has grown rapidly over the last decade

At the 
time of the incident, Mr Harty said: ‘All I felt was the pain, and I 
heard the noise. I looked down and I was bleeding, and I had no idea 
why.

‘We got down and I thought I was the only one who had been hit, but then I heard lots of screaming.

‘You’d think it happens maybe in London but I don’t think I have ever heard of [something like this happening] in Horsham.’

Mr Cave and Mr Harty are members of Horsham Parkour.

Mr Cave is also a member of several 
other collectives, including the Storror team – one of the world’s top 
free-running units which has filmed stunts for global brands including 
Google and Red Bull.
