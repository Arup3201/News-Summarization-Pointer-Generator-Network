A globe-trotting couple took their three children out of school for a once in a lifetime gap year travelling the world.

Expats Jen
 and Neil Taylor from Elgin took Adam, 16, Matt, 14, Katie, 10 - and 
their campervan - on a £50,000 adventure last year.

They've just 
finished their year-long trip after covering more than 50,000 miles 
through some of the most exotic and beautiful landscapes in the world.

Along
 the way they rode camels in the desert, washed elephants in Thailand, 
had a mud bath in Spain and visited a host of historic sites.

But while Neil and Jen wanted their children to see their world, they didn't let their education suffer.

The couple got permission from the French authorities to take the kids out of school as they made sure they kept up with school work on the road.

Jen, 44, said: 'It was a great chance for our children to see a bit of the world and learn about different cultures.

'We
 knew that if we didn't do it now, our oldest son Adam would have had 
too much going on at school and we'd never get to do it all together.'

The
 family owned a bakery in their home town but moved 
to the rural region of Limousine in France in 2007 so their three 
children could learn to speak another language.

They went to Spain 
and Portugal in the campervan before ditching it back in Spain and 
getting flights to Thailand, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and other parts of the 
Middle East.

They then flew back to Spain to get the van before travelling through Greece, Italy, Morocco, Eastern Europe and Austria.

They spent months at a time in each location, making friends and immersing themselves in the culture.

The last part of their trip saw them travel back to Scotland where they met up with family in Perth.The epic journey cost just shy of £15,000 - excluding the cost of the campervan.

Their
 daily costs rose slightly during their trips to Australia, Thailand and
 the Middle East as they had to leave their mobile home behind.

However, they brought the overall budget back in line by reducing how much they spent while living in Morocco.

'Our
 budget was £8 per person per day for food, accommodation costs, travel 
and everything else,' said Jen.

'Although the campervan helped keep this
 down.'

Taking the kids out of school could have had a huge 
impact on their education if it weren't for the fact that Neil and Jen 
made sure they wouldn't fall behind during their year out.

In order 
to do this they bought books which covered the curriculum their children
 would have covered during the same year at school.

Head teachers should only authorise leave of absence in exceptional circumstances.

If a head teacher grants a leave request, it will be for the head teacher to determine the length of time that the child can be away from school.

Leave is unlikely, however, to be granted for the purposes of a family holiday as a norm.

They also had to write to education chiefs in France to get permission to take them out of school for 12 months.

Once they got the go ahead, the only challenge left was getting them to do the work on the move.

Jen
 said she and Neil had the 'fanciful' idea of getting their kids out of 
bed at 7am every morning and working from 8 to 10am but that notion 
didn't last long.

She said: 'That lasted a week. In all honesty, even
 a little less than that. It might have worked for some families but it 
was a disaster for ours.

'We forgot the plain old fact that teenagers have a changing body-clock and mornings are, basically, tough.

'We nagged for a while, being new to it all, but by the time we hit Spain, our first country, we began to relax.'

Jen said the boys were given the task of breaking up what they had to learn and working out when they'd cover each section.

Amazingly, they stuck to their plan and kept up their schoolwork throughout the trip.

Jen
 said: 'The less we pushed the more they did. The nagging lingered for a
 couple of months but we could see that, as it died away, the motivation
 rate increased.'

The former solicitor now teaches English while Neil, 47, is an agricultural engineer who now works on a goat farm.

The couple are childhood sweethearts who have just celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary.

After graduating, they went on a round-the-world trip that was supposed to last for 18 months.

However,
 the adventure was cut short when they were involved in a horrific crash
 in Australia when the car they were travelling in was hit by a lorry 
behind them. The collision caused their car to career off the road and 
into a tree.

Neil escaped serious injury but Jen broke almost every 
bone in her body, suffered a punctured lung and spent almost three 
months in hospital.

The experience changed the couple's outlook on 
life, making them more determined to do the things they want to when 
they want to.

Jen said: 'Since the accident we've done a lot of things on the spur of the moment.'

The Taylor children are now getting ready to start back at school in France after their year of sightseeing.

Jen
 said: 'The kids are excited to see their friends back at school and 
tell them what they've been up to. They're also going to do a 
presentation in the village hall for the locals.'
