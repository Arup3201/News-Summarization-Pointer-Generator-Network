The Federal Aviation Administration has effectively grounded Uber-style flight-sharing services that allowed passengers to hitch a ride with private pilots.

A legal ruling by the FAA on Wednesday said pilots were generally not allowed to advertise available seats on their planes and accept payment for fuel costs unless they have commercial licenses.

That premise - connecting private, small plane pilots with passengers - was the basis for AirPooler and several other online start-ups that were hoping to do for the skies what Air BnB and Uber have done for sharing apartments and hailing cabs.

It seems now that the concept may have crashed before it even got a chance to get off the ground.

AirPooler asked for legal advice from the FAA on whether its business model was permissible. FAA assistant counsel for international law Mark W. Bury responded: 'In your request for legal interpretation, you maintain that the AirPooler service is not a commercial operation and does not involve common carriage because there is no compensation for pilots. We disagree.'

AirPooler maintains that the company satisfies a big demand for paring passengers who want to get away and pilots who are hoping to save some cash on their next flight.  

'There’s a really deep underlying economic basis. It’s much more than a fad for the shared economy because you have all these assets around that are being underutilized,' AirPooler CEO Steve Lewis told Bloomberg. 

AirPooler operated as a 'car pooling for the skies' - like an Air BnB for planes - that allowed passengers and pilots to split the cost of a private plane flight

The 'sharing economy' has led to major success for companies like Uber and Air BnB. Uber, which lets users circumvent traditional taxi services by summoning private cabs from the smart phones, is worth an estimated $17billion. Air BnB, which allows people to rent out their apartments - or rooms in their homes - for short periods of time raised $500billion from investors in April. 

AirPooler and similar companies like FlyteNow say they will continue to negotiate with the FAA to find a way to operate within the rules.

In the meantime, the flight sharing board has gone dry. There are currently no available flight sharing offers listed in major markets on AirPooler. 

The FAA ruling leaves one small glimmer of hope for the future of flight sharing. The regulator said that existing laws allow private pilots to receive payment for fuel and maintenance from passengers - as long as the fliers had already planned to travel to a specific destination. 

The rule had previously been exercised through world-of-mouth and offline ride boards, however, and the FAA said that AirPooler's system didn't operate within the narrow definition of the law.

The FAA ruled this did not meet the narrow legal requirements and amounted to illegal compensation for private pilots
