Peas on earth: Jessie J warms up her vocal cords by drinking juiced chickpeas

It may sound revolting, but singer Jessie J warms up her vocal cords before every performance by drinking chickpea juice.

She makes it herself – or gets staff  to make it – by boiling chickpeas and  then juicing them with water and a  touch of garlic.

A backstage source at The Brits 2014, where the Platinum-selling pop star was nominated for Best Solo Female Artist, revealed: ‘Jessie specifically requested boiled chickpeas along with the more typical requests like lemon and ginger.

'We were asked for a kettle and a juicer.’

Chickpeas are high in iron,  which helps transport oxygen around the body – making  Jessie certain she can hit the  high notes in her bestselling hits including Price Tag, Domino  and It’s My Party.

Now the Brits are finished,  she’s heading to America to rerecord her album Alive for the  US market and to perform some small live shows.

Let’s hope one of her assistants has the chickpeas  in their luggage to ensure Jessie’s impressive vocal  cords stay in perfect shape.

Could Friday night at the pictures become a fun evening in hospital?

Patients at Guy’s Hospital London can now see the latest blockbusters in a state-of-the-art 3D cinema.

The new MediCinema has 37 seats and holds ﬁve hospital beds and seven wheelchairs, so patients undergoing different types of treatment can enjoy watching a film.

Trust chairman Sir Hugh Taylor says: ‘It brings the outside world into the hospital, allowing patients and relatives to enjoy the wonderful experience of watching a ﬁlm with others.’

Whether they’ll be showing Carry On Doctor remains to be seen...

Marrying might be disastrous for your waistline – especially if your nearest and dearest pressure you to slim down beforehand.

Six months after tying the knot, brides have put on an average of more than 4lb, says a study.

Researchers looked at 343 brides. Ten months before the wedding, 46 per cent – average weight 10st 8lb – wanted to be 20lb lighter on the big day.

Skinny love: Married bliss and comfort - and making an effort to slim down for the big day - sees brides gain an average 4lbs six months after their wedding

In
 the event, average weight did not change before the wedding, but they 
gained after. The 13 per cent who had been told to lose weight by mums, 
fiances or someone else put on the most.

‘It
 is possible that weakened motivation is due to feeling as if they have 
already snagged their man,’ said Ivanka Prichard, who  led the study at 
Flinders University in Australia.

Clean cut: Beckham's famously hairless chest

Victoria Beckham never shaves her legs – relying on laser hair removal, as recommended by pal Eva Longoria. But there’s no word yet on whether husband David does the same.

His famously hair-free chest is believed to lie behind soaring numbers of young men opting for laser hair removal.

Sk:n clinics has seen a  122 per cent 
increase in 18 to 25-year-old men having laser hair removal treatments 
over the past five years, and the most popular area is the torso.

While
 Becks is credited with starting the ‘craze’, the fuzz-free look is now 
seen on sports stars and actors alike, including Daniel Craig and Ryan 
Gosling.

If
 you have a heart attack anywhere other than in hospital, your chances 
of survival are just two to 12 per cent.

One reason is the shortage of 
defibrillators in public places, according to a new study published in 
the journal Heart, which says thousands of lives are being lost 
unnecessarily.

Every
 minute of delay in resuscitating someone increases the risk of death by
 up to ten per cent.

Defibrillators are easy to use and can shock a 
heart back into rhythm before an ambulance arrives.

Christopher
 Allen, senior nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘They are 
fully automated and a recorded message will tell you how to use it. All 
you need to do is attach the pads and press a button.’
