They're the dust collecting items in your home that could actually make you a small fortune and people are starting to cash in on everything from old teapots to strange sculptures.

Research shows Australians have earned close to an additional $4,000 per person in the past year through the sale of unwanted goods - enough to cover a household’s entire petrol bill for a year.

But there is still cash to be made with the average Australian holding onto 23 unwanted items in their home, according to the Second Hand Economy Report by Australia’s Gumtree website.

 Only six percent of Australians get their unwanted goods valued, so Gumtree partnered with TV valuers, the Aussie Pickers, to help put a price on people's dust collecting items 

With only six percent of the population getting their unwanted goods valued, Gumtree partnered with TV valuers, the Aussie Pickers, to tour the east coast of Australia giving people the opportunity to see just how much their dust-collecting items would fetch.

'We valued everything from a really expensive trophy to everyday items like telephones and stuff passed down from grandparents,' Lucas Callaghan, one half of the Aussie Pickers, told Daily Mail Australia.

The kookiest item Mr Callaghan valued was a unique silver plated and incredibly tarnished trophy. 

The kookiest item Mr Callaghan valued was a unique silver plated and incredibly tarnished trophy, which he believes is worth around $125,000

An unexpectedly valuable item was a French blown glass decorative ball, which could easily be mistaken for tacky decoration you would find at a $2 store. Instead it could valued at about $300

One man brought a commemorative gold-plated $100 Australian note to be valued, which  could fetch more than $1,000

This handmade square teapot (left) could easily make $300 to $400, while the mass produced Japanese design (right) would be only about $40 to $50  

'One woman found this tin sculpture left in her shed by her father. It was independently designed and especially made. I don't want to speculate too much, but I believe it's worth around $125,000,' he said.

'It doesn't look like much, but the detail is actually incredible. It's early 19th century I'd say and most likely a decorative piece.'

'They're basically paper weights, they're solid glass. I know sometimes they can be valued up to $300,' Mr Callaghan said. 

Vintage bags can be found almost anywhere and unless from a high-end designer or maker are unlikely to get much return

Vintage posters are also interesting pieces from certain eras, but don't fetch much because they're so widespread

Mr Callaghan said for the average punter selling on sites like Gumtree, it comes down to research and detail to get the highest price

One man brought a commemorative gold-plated $100 Australian note to be valued, which he believes could fetch more than $1,000. 

'The money was a great piece but it's hard to value something like that because it's a modern copy of currency. The gentleman paid $1,000 for that. The gold value is there, but when it comes to printable items they've probably got 100 of them.'

Vintage crockery can often be of little value even though many people think they are vintage. 

Considering they're common in second hand shops and even at your grandma's house, they're generally unlikely to get more than $40-$50.

But Mr Callaghan came across one unique teapot in the shape of a square he thinks could have easily raked in $400 to $500.

This early 1900s Elgin pocket watch was estimated to pay between $300 - $500

This World War 1 Red Cross Certificate was valued between $300 to $500

An 1890s Heinz Munschauer solid oak ice box made in Buffalo, New York was estimated to be worth $900

A vintage Mr Potato Head and his friend Pete the Pepper (original box included) was valued at $40

'When you've got a square box teapot that's hand produced sitting next to a teapot that was mass produced, you can see how it would be worth more,' he said. 

Mr Callaghan said for the average punter selling on sites like Gumtree, it comes down to research and detail to get the highest price.

'If you see something that has loads of detail that is the key. The higher the detail, the higher the value,' he said. 

'As Australians we are a hoarding group. We accumulate stuff and we stick it somewhere in our property to forget about.'
