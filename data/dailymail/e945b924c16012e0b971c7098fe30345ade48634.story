A 14-year-old mystery could finally be solved after a piece of clothing handed into police is believed to be the bodysuit worn by Cathy Freeman during the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

The iconic suit was donned by the former athlete when she lit the Olympic torch and disappeared from her dressing room at Stadium Australia in September 2000.

It has not been seen since then but more than a decade later authorities have had a break-through.

A Victoria police spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an item had been handed over to them by a representative of the Melbourne Cricket Club at the Melbourne East station.

'The article was alleged to have been stolen in NSW in the year 2000,' he said.

'Police are attempting to confirm the authenticity of the item and are liaising with the NSW Police.'

The Australian Olympic Committee have released a statement about the find.

They said the MCC staff member had 'received it anonymously' and it would hopefully settle a lot of unanswered questions.

'On that night, Cathy was soaked while standing under a waterfall after a mechanical fault delayed the lighting of the cauldron,' the statement said.

'She removed the suit after the ceremony and it has not been seen since.

'What happened to the suit has been the subject of much debate over the years as it is a major part of Australia’s Olympic history.

'We are hoping the item of clothing handed to the MCC Museum is authentic and the mystery is finally solved.'
