Hero doctor: Dr Lee Silverman helped stop a mental patient's deadly rampage by injuring Richard Plotts with a gun shot

'I just want to meet the doctor and thank him,' Kimberly said at her tidy red-brick house in a Philadelphia suburb.

'I am not saying I wish he had killed him, I would never feel that way about anyone, but a world where my ex is not around will be a much safer world.

'He has been in and out of trouble for 20 years and if he hasn't been rehabbed by now he never will be. I hope he never gets out of prison — we will all be in trouble if he does.

'He has never been stable. He is very unpredictable. He can be the nicest person in the world, talking with you and then suddenly he would get the look of evil in his eye and he would put a knife to your throat.'

after he shot dead his caseworker, Theresa Hunt

Psychiatrist Dr. Lee Silverman pumped three bullets into Plotts at the Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby, Pennsylvania on Thursday after the patient had shot and killed caseworker Theresa Hunt.

Shock: Theresa Hunt was shot dead by Richard Plotts in a Philadelphia hospital on Thursday after an argument broke out and a gun battle ensued

Authorities say Plotts, 49, had been ranting about the hospital's no-gun policy when he pulled out his weapon.

Police found 39 unused rounds on Plotts and seized two more revolvers and a computer when they searched his home in Upper Derby, Pennsylvania.

Silverman, who has been hailed as a hero for his actions, crouched behind his desk, took out his own handgun and returned fire.

The hospital is unlikely to take action against Silverman for having the gun on the premises and says it will welcome him back to work.

Kimberly, 49, says she was shocked but not surprised to hear that the man she was married to for more than a decade had finally killed someone.

'He was always threatening and he said that one day he would kill me — and I knew it was always possible," she said. 'He is a very violent person.'

Plotts and
 Kimberly met in high school. 'I was attracted to him because he was the
 bad boy,' she says. But they drifted apart and when they reunited 
Plotts seemed to have cleaned up his act. "He was involved in a church 
group in Concordville, even living with the group leader,' she says.

'He was a born again Christian, very clean cut.'

But
 soon after their 1988 wedding, things started to go wrong. 'He was very
 abusive, physically and verbally,' she says. But though he gave her 
black eyes and bloody lips, Plotts never seriously injured his wife.

She soon realized she had to get out of the marriage, but every time she asked for a divorce he threw up roadblocks.

It was only when he was sentenced to jail for a bank robbery in the mid 1990s that she managed to end the marriage officially.

'When the judge sentenced him to 80 months in jail it was a huge weight lifted from my shoulders. I knew that for 80 months I wouldn't have to be looking over my shoulder all the time, wondering if he was following me.'

Kimberly dropped his name and reverted to her maiden name of Heron, but once his jail sentence was over her nightmare started again.

He managed to find her, turning up on her doorstep. "He threatened to kill me. He threatened to kill our children.

Plotts was arraigned in his bed in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania on Saturday night soon after he came round from heavy sedation. He was charged with seven counts including murder and attempted murder.

Now the legal wheels have started turning, Kimberly says she feels relief. 'I am relieved for myself, I am relieved for my family that I know he won't be around for a long time. I just feel such sorrow for the family of the woman he killed and the people he injured.'

Kimberly first heard of the horror at Mercy Fitzgerald on Thursday evening when a friend who works for a lab called her saying she recognized her ex-husband's name on bloodwork on a gunshot case she was dealing with.

'She was just worried he had shot me,' she says.

Kimberly says people have expressed shock that her ex could own guns with his criminal record, but she says his status as a convicted felon never prevented him getting his hands on weapons.

'He has been arrested time and time again for having guns and no permit, but he still managed to get hold of them.'

Kimberly's fears that she could have been her ex'x victim rather than his caseworker appear well-founded. T

The Delaware County Daily Times newspaper quoted an 'acquaintance' of Plotts as saying : 'I would say that he threatened me many times. I felt like I was going to get shot. He would threaten his caseworkers because he didn’t want to keep (doctor) appointments.

'And a couple times, he told me that he would have liked to shoot his ex-wife.'

The paper also reported that detectives are being asked to re-open an old sudden death case to see if Plotts was involved.

Plotts discovered the body and Superintendent Michael Chitwood of Upper Darby Police has now asked that the case be re-examined.
