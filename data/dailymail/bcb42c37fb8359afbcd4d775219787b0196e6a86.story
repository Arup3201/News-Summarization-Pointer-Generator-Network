Cat cafes may have been all the rage in 2014, but 2015 is set to be the year of canine with America's first dog cafe hoping to open in Los Angeles this year.

At The Dog Cafe, customers will be able to enjoy a cup of coffee or tea while cuddling a group of adorable pooches that will be roaming free on the premises and available for adoption. 

Founder and animal rescuer Sarah Wolfgang has already raised more than $6,000 on Indiegogo to fund her plans and hopes to reach her goal of $200,000 by February 5.

Cuddly coffee: America's first 'dog cafe,' which will allow customers to enjoy a cup of coffee while playing with some adorable pups, is looking to open in Los Angeles

Fresh start: The Dog Cafe will serve as an adoption center for rescue dogs, offering rehabilitation and training to prepare them for their future homes

The money will be used to construct two side-by-side locations that will serve as the cafe and the dog zone, as well as provide furniture and supplies.

In ordinance with the LA Health Department, customers will first purchase their coffee or tea at the cafe before heading over to the 'dog zone' where the lovable pooches will be hanging out and ready to play.

As Miss Wolfgang says in a video posted to her company's website, the business will be a 'coffee shop where you'll be completely surrounded by dogs - small, big, quiet, crazy, young, old, all sorts of dogs.'

Big plans: Miss Wolfgang is trying to raise $200,000 to construct two side-by-side locations and provide furniture and supplies

Miss Wolfgang, who spent time finding homes for dogs in Korea, says she was inspired to create the pooch-friendly coffee shop after she volunteered at numerous LA animals shelters and realized they had a higher intake than adoptions.

Just purchasing a cup a cup of coffee will help her cause.

Miss Wolfgang has partnered with Grounds and Hounds Coffee Co., which donates 20per cent of its proceeds in Southern California to local rescue partners.
