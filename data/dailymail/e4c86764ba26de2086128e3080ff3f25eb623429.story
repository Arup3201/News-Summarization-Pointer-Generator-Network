New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s chronic lateness has rubbed reporters the wrong way since his inauguration, but now even children are becoming impatient.

A four-year-old child broke protocol and sat down in front of adults standing at the front of a Thursday event where the mayor was almost an hour late to sign his first bill into law, the boy then refused to clap as the bill was signed.

Jael Jesus Ramirez is not the first child to have issue with hizzonor’s lack of regard for others’ time, a child infamously passed out waiting for the chronically-late mayor to introduce his new city schools chancellor earlier late last year.

People are informally required to stand at the front of events attended by the mayor, regardless of tardiness.

The Mayor’s first few months have been marred by lateness so routine that city hall reporters have taken to calling it ‘de Blasio time’ on social media.

WCBS reporter Marsha Kramer, who has covered city hall for decades, said she’s ‘never seen anything like it,’ in a recent report.

Event attendees haven’t been much kinder, but none took to sitting down while waiting for the recently-elected mayor until Ramirez plunked himself down as de Blasio spoke about a paid sick leave bill.

Soon after Mayor de Blasio finally took his seat, 45 minutes late, Ramirez was seated next to him.

Indifferent: Ramirez seems unimpressed with sitting next to the mayor while he signs his first bill into law

The audience ceremoniously clapped as the mayor went through pen after pen, using a different one for each letter of his name, as he signed the bill – all except Ramirez.

The young boy looked unimpressed, bored even, and refused to clap while his mother even tried to spur him on.

She instead awkwardly raised his arm in the arm as he glanced unhappily in the mayor’s direction.The incident earned an instant classic headline from the New York Post.

‘Sit happens! Kid can’t ‘stand’ wait for chronically late de Blasio.’

An expert told WCBS that de Blasio’s traveling ‘late show,’ as the Post put it, will negatively affect public perception.

‘There’s no question that if you are late that it affects your reputation and that people lose their ability to trust you, especially in politics, especially when you’re in public office’ psychologist Dr Harris Stratyner told the station.

When asked by Kramer if he thinks reports about ‘de Blasio time’ are unfair, the mayor seemed unamused.

‘You know, Marcia, I think the important this is when you get elected to do a job like this, responsible for 8.4 million people with every conceivable subject matter, my job is to do the best for the people,’ said de Blasio.

‘That’s what matters,’ he continued. ‘The rest is noise.’

Not everyone agrees.

‘Bill de Blasio is always running so late, he probably still hasn't moved his clocks back an hour,’ Eric Dixon wrote on Twitter.

Another person lampooned reports last month the mayor was speeding stop signs and red lights.

‘Imagine how late he would have been if he didn’t speed and run stop signs to get there,’ tweeted Scott Goldberg.

Dr Stratyner had some great advice for helping de Blasio show up on-time to events ‘by investing in a good watch and setting it ahead one hour.'
