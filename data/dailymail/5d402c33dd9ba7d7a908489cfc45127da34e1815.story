Jimmy Bullard has still managed to get himself on the TV despite his eviction from I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here 2014 - by gatecrashing Good Morning Britain dressed in budgie smugglers!

The 36-year-old former Wigan Athletic, Fulham and Hull City midfielder was voted off the show on Monday after appearing to bully one of the other contestants.

Yet when ITV were reporting from the hotel which the evicted celebrities stay in on Wednesday morning, Carl Fogarty's wife Michaela was shocked when Bullard arrived by traipsing through the pool in just swimming trunks.

But the 36-year-old revealed the incidents  had been taken out of context by the programme's editors, leading to a campaign to reinstate Bullard.

Bullard admitted he was touched by the sentiment, but had no desire to return to the jungle.

He tweeted: 'Back at the Versace with @MattRichardson3 love the bring back jimmy campaign but don't you dare #dontbringjimmyback.'

The much-loved midfielder, who was known for his comic antics both on and off the pitch during his football career, was well-liked by his fellow contestants who were evidently sad at his elimination from the show.
