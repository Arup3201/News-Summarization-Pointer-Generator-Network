Brooke Mueller entered the Betty Ford Center for a 30-day rehab stint on Thursday, the very same clinic that Lindsay Lohan is currently checked into.

The two women are currently staying in the hospital wing of the facility in Rancho Mirage, California, and have already run into each other, reports TMZ.

The 35-year-old mother of Charlie Sheen's twin sons is said to have chosen the clinic because she wanted to carry out her substance abuse treatment alongside Lohan, according to RadarOnline.

Mueller was not legally bound to enter rehab after her four-year-old sons Bob and Max were removed from her care last week by officials who allegedly found them living in 'shocking conditions.'

She is also not guaranteed to regain custody of the two boys after her rehab stint, reports RadarOnline, after they were placed in the care of Sheen's other ex wife Denise Richards.

The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services reportedly didn’t want the socialite to enter the Betty Ford Center because of Lohan's presence.

It's unsure how well the two women 
know each other, but they do both share a strong connection in Charlie 
Sheen, Mueller's ex husband and Lindsay's self appointed mentor.

Self-appointed mentor: Sheen offered his support to Lohan in March, claiming he felt a 'kinship' with her

Charlie recently expressed a desire 
to mentor the star, and even offered to give her money during one of her
particularly troubled periods. Lindsay also recently guest starred in 
Charlie's hit television show Anger Management.

'I have a kinship with somebody who 
clearly needs a mentor, whether she wants one or not,' he said in March.

'She can continue to hang out with her dress-shredding club buddies, or
turn to me for some advice from a guy who's been down the road as well 
as every other side trail on the journey.'

'If she listens, she'll win. If she doesn't, that's on her,' he added.

This is not the first time Richards has taken in the boys, who are the younger half-siblings of her two oldest daughters.

Richards also stepped in last year to look after the twins while Brooke underwent a different stint in rehab.

Mueller was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold at the UCLA Medical Center for two days last week before checking out of the hospital on Friday. The twins were removed from her home during her involuntary stay at the hospital.

She checked in again on Sunday for short-term rehab and later will move into a longer rehab program.

Also on Friday, a judge officially accepted the Betty Ford Center as a suitable alternative for Lohan's 90-day court-order treatment after she failed to check into the court-appointed Seafield facility lat Thursday.

Judge Jim Dabney gave Lohan the okay to enter Betty Ford, but gave prosecutors until Friday to file any objections.

According to TMZ, both the Los Angeles and Santa Monica City Attorneys have given the okay for her to remain where she is.

Meanwhile, Lohan's The Canyons' costar James Deen has said that he misses the actress and wishes her well in rehab after accusing her of acting like a diva on set, reports RadarOnline.

The 27-year-old porn star, who recently starred in Teen Mom Farrah Abraham's first skin flick, said that after his experience dealing with a reality star, Lohan seemed fine in comparison.

'Honestly, after this whole experience I really do miss Lindsay,' he said.

'I’ve been taught that movie star and reality star is very different and I just miss Lindsay.'

And Lindsay's parents Michael and Dina also seem to have found peace after Michael finally paid back the $30,400 in child support he owed his ex-wife.

'I admit that I withheld part of my child support because of my anger 
toward Dina, but I now want to admit that I was wrong for doing it and 
have made things right,' he told told Radar.

As for Lindsay, he is hoping to move her to another rehab facility after she checked into Betty Ford last Thursday for her court-mandated stay.

'I would like Dina and Lindsay to consider having Lindsay go to the Lukens Institute because it is more private (only 8 people), it’s not 12-Step, it gives 6 hours of psychotherapy and its success rate is higher than any place I have experienced,' Michael said.
