Jeopardy stumped it's contestants with a question and one controversial news reporter was amused by the little 'ego check.'

Fox News reporter Megyn Kelly played a clip on her show 'The Kelly File' on Monday night revealing the moment she was a jeopardy question and nobody knew who she was.

'File' this blonde anchor and lawyer under Fox News where she hosts a show weekdays from 9 to 10 p.m,' Jeopardy host Alex Trebek asked.

Ego Check: 'Don't be fooled, I'm huge' joked Megyn Kelly on her show on Monday night

Stumped: The answer was 'Megyn Kelly' but nobody ever even heard of her

Fail: 'Who is Nancy Grace?' guessed this contestant

The contestants were dumbfounded when asked the question.

One contestant named Mary guessed, 'Who is Nancy Grace?'

Megyn Kelly maintained her sense of humor about the situation and joked.'Don't be fooled, I am huge!'

'There's always something to keep your ego in check,' she continued.

Kelly also quipped that she was the $800 question, 'so they knew it was going to be hard,' she said.

One Huffington Post politics reporter Jason Linkins wasn't surprised contestants didn't know who she was and speculated that there is a relationship between not watching cable news and 'succeeding in an intellectual capacity' on a show like Jeopardy.

While the Jeopardy contestants had no idea who Kelly was, some offended Americans have heard of her.

Megyn Kelly made news recently when she said that both Santa Claus and Jesus were ' just white.'

Kelly was responding to an essay in Slate.com by an African American named Aisha Harris who says she felt ashamed as a child because Santa was only depicted as white, reports Variety.

Harris argued that there should be a more universal depiction of the widely loved holiday symbol. Kelly disagreed.

'Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn’t mean it has to change. Jesus was a white man, too. He was a historical figure. That’s a verifiable fact — as is Santa. I just want the kids watching to know that. My point is, how do you just revise it in the middle of the legacy of the story and change Santa from white to black?'said Megyn.

Kelly later addressed her comments and said she was being tounge-in-cheek, but only some people knew who she was anyway.
