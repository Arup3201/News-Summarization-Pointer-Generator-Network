A 17-year-old boy who was shot to death in a 'targeted attack' has been named by police as detectives desperately try to piece together his last moments.

Kevin Wilson was found lying on a street in Wavertree, Liverpool, last night after being shot in the back at about 8.30pm.

Emergency crews desperately tried to save the teenager, who is originally from Scotland but was living in Liverpool, and he was taken to Royal Liverpool University Hospital. However, he passed away a short time later.

His next of kin have been informed.

Police have launched a murder investigation after Kevin Wilson, 17, was shot in the back in the Wavertree area of Liverpool at about 8.30pm last night. Police said he died from his injuries after being taken to hospital

Police have now launched a murder investigation into his death and are combing the scene for evidence. 

While officers are still trying to establish the possible motive for the attack, Superintendent Jenny Sims, of Merseyside Police, said they believe Mr Wilson was deliberately targeted.

She said: 'We would like to reassure the local community that we believe this was a targeted attack and that incidents of this nature are still rare.

'We are not prepared to allow the close work we have developed with the community to be disrupted.

'The community and partner agencies have worked hard with Merseyside Police to endeavour to eradicate firearm incidents and we have seen a significant reduction over the last few years.

'I want to make it very clear that we are not prepared to tolerate these incidents and we will be taking a strong and robust approach against those suspected of being involved.

'High visibility patrols have been increased in the area and officers will be speaking local residents to help reassure the local community.'

Police were scrambled to the scene at about 8.30pm following reports of a man being shot.

Officers performed CPR on the teenager until paramedics arrived but he could not be saved.

A police cordon remains in place at the scene today and officers said the road would remain closed for now. It is not yet known what the motive was for the shooting, but police said they believe it was a 'targeted attack'

People quickly took to Twitter to offer their condolences to the victim, who was shot in the back, police said

Residents have taken to social media overnight to express their shock at the incident.

Paige Cubbon wrote on Twitter: 'Thoughts go out to the family and friends of the lad shot dead on Smithdown tonight.

'Scary how real and close it is to my house. So awful.'

Another Twitter user, Annie, said: 'Awful news - lad has just been shot on Smithdown Road. These guns need to be off the streets. Terrible.'

And Johnpaul MacDonald said: 'Someone's been shot dead on Smithdown Road - only heard plod sirens out there the last couple of hours, mental night in Toxteth.'

The road remains closed as officers continue to their investigations at the scene. It is expected to remain shut for the next couple of days, with a police cordon in place.

Others took to Twitter to share news of the incident (above), which occurred at about 8.30pm on Saturday

Detective chief superintendent Karen Cummings, of Merseyside Police, said: 'The investigation is in its early stages and extensive inquiries are being carried out to establish any potential motive and to identify those responsible.

'I would urge anyone who saw anything, or who has any information which could help us with our inquiries to contact us urgently.

'You may not think that the information you have is significant but it could help us with our inquiries in relation to either of these incidents.'

A post mortem examination is due to be carried out in due course to determine the official cause of death.
