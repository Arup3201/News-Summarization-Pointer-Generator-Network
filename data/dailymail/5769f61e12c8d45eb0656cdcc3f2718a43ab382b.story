Senseless: Delbert Belton an 88-year-old veteran of World War II was beaten to death outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane, and police have arrested two teens in connection with the murder

The fugitive teenager wanted in connection with the brutal murder of an 88-year-old Spokane WWII veteran has been arrested this morning after a four-day man-hunt.

Kenan Adams-Kinard, 16, is the second teen to be arrested for the murder of Delbert Belton, who was beaten to death with flashlights in a random attack in a bar parking lot where he had arrived to play pool on Wednesday.

The teen was arrested on a 1st degree robbery and 1st degree murder warrant and was brought into custody by Spokane police to join fellow suspect, 16-year-old Demetrius Glenn, who was arrested on Thursday.

Several other people found with Adams-Kinard have been arrested for rendering criminal assistance to the teen during his time in hiding.

He was found in a basement apartment at 500 West Montgomery in Spokane and arrested without incident at 3.00 a.m. according to KHQ.Com.

Prior to his arrest, the family of Kenan had urged him to come forward and turn himself over to the police.

'He's
out there and if anybody knows where he's at or something, they really 
need to contact the family because we are trying to bring him in,' said 
Kenan's Dad, who wished to remain anonymous.

'We don't want this 
prolonged, we really need to get this over with and get through with 
this and find out what's really the situation, of really, what happened 
in this tragedy.'

Most wanted: Police say Adams-Kinard was arrested by Spokane Police on Monday morning after a four day man-hunt

Rather than a random murder, Kenan's uncle said that he believed there was another side to the murder which has not been heard.

'They
are building it like these kids just went and beat up an old man, which
it didn't occur like that, but it is all going to come out,' Kenan's 
Uncle said to KHQ.Com.

Last Thursday night, police arrested Demetrius Glenn, 16, in connection to the slaying of 88-year-old Delbert Belton, who was savagely beaten with flashlights in the parking lot of his regular bar in Spokane on Wednesday. 

Belton, who was shot in the leg during the pivotal battle of the Pacific campaign, passed away from serious head injuries Thursday at Sacred Heart Medical Center in the city.

Police told Belton's daughter-in-law, Bobby, 
that he was beaten with heavy flashlights in the assault which left him 
bleeding 'from every part of his face'.

Witnesses to the attack said that Belton, who was going to play pool, was outside the Eagles Lodge at around 8pm when two male suspects set upon him.

A friend said the veteran had just pulled up and was waiting for a female friend so she didn't have to walk in alone.

Surrender: Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his lawyer

'It
does appear random. He was in the parking lot, it appears he was 
assaulted in the parking lot and there was no indication that he would 
have known these people prior to the assault,' Spokane Police Major 
Crimes Detective Lieutenant Mark Griffiths said.

On Thursday evening, police released surveillance photos of the two suspects, Glenn and Kinard.

Dark past: Adams-Kinard was convicted of third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault in June

Glenn faces a first-degree murder charge and one count of robbery. The local station KHQ reported that he will be tried as an adult.

The teen has an extensive juvenile 
criminal history, which includes malicious mischief, fourth-degree 
assault, driving without a license and riot with a deadly weapon 
charges.

Adams-Kinard also has had a few run-ins with the law, The Spokesman Review reported. He was convicted of third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault in June.

Police
Chief Frank Straub said Adams-Kinard should be considered a threat to 
the community and should not be contacted. He urged anyone who sees him 
or has information on his whereabouts to call 911 at once.

Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his attorney just before 10pm Thursday. Officers noticed that the teen had an abrasion on his right hand, according to an affidavit.

While being questioned by police, Glenn was asked to stand up and show what he was wearing.

'These are not the shorts from the video,' Glenn said, according to the report, apparently referring to the surveillance footage.

Glenn, who spells his first name as 'Demetruis' on social media sites, described himself on his Twitter account in this manner: 'I Play Foot-ball,Run Tracc [sic],Get Money Do What i do,im a guy but i like the show keeping up with the kardashians.'

Delbert 'Shorty' Belton was taken to the Intensive Care Unit of Sacred Heart after the assault at the Eagles Ice-A-Rena near Lidgerwood, but succumbed to his wounds.

Wanted: Police released images of two possible suspects between the ages of 16 and 19. One juvenile was arrested this morning

Suspect Number Two: Police say two teens assaulted 88-year-old Delbert Belton outside the Eagles Lodge in North Spokane Wednesday night. One teen has been arrested in connection to the crime

Family members were today grieving for the widower, who is survived by one son Bill, 65, who is currently in hospital himself.

Daughter-in-law Bobby Belton told KREM-TV she received the police call and had to break the news to her ill husband.

'They used those great, big heavy flashlights,'' she said. 'The doctor said he was bleeding from all parts of his face.

'You expect older people to die but not in that way. You just don't do those kind of things'

His sister Alberta Tosh told the Spokesman Review: 'He was a good guy who would help anybody if they needed help,' she said.

His great-nephew Allen Hills told KHQ that the veteran took him in and put him back on his feet when he hit rock bottom.

'It seems trivial, but he really did save my life. He made it possible for me to get a job and find work,' he said.

'He wasn't just my great-uncle. He was a great person, and he didn't deserve to die like that.'

Friends were left equally outraged that the serviceman would die in such a callous way.

'He put his life on the line for our country to come home and 60 years later? Get beat to death?' his closest friend Ted Denison told the Review. 'That’s not right.'

Denison who knew Belton for 23 years regularly played pool with the former soldier who went on to be an aluminum worker.

He worked at Kaiser Aluminum’s Trentwood rolling mill until his retirement in 1982 but remained a skilled member of the Steelworkers Union.

His wife died several years ago.

'He went up there and played pool, met with some of the guys he used to work with at Kaiser Aluminum,' he told CNN.

'It's really depressing. Seems that all there is is bad news.'

Police said that Belton had just arrived with a lady-friend to play pool at the lodge when he was set upon.

'Those
people to me are cowards,' said Denison to KXLY.com. 'They are cowards when they 
beat old people that are defenseless.... They need to be caught. Period.
Because that's senseless. Beating an old man, what kind of person does 
that? But a wimp to me.'

'He was always there for me when I needed him,' he added. 'We'd joke
back and forth. We were always having fun, some sort of fun.'

Their outrage was mirrored online. On Twitter a campaign titled Justice for Delbert Belton was spreading this morning.

Actor James Woods was one high profile supporter.

'Don't let him die without anyone caring,' read one of his many posts on the killing.

The police are looking for two male suspects in the attack, with one described as heavy set and wearing all black clothing and the other as 6 feet tall and 150 pounds.
