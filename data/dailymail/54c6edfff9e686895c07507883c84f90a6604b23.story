The number of Britons working after they start collecting their pensions has doubled in nearly 20 years because growing numbers simply cannot afford to retire.

A new study has found that 1.4 million pensioners, 12 per cent of the total elderly population, are earning extra money compared to 753,000 in 1993.

And it is women who need to earn for longer, with 61 per cent of all these older workers found to be female.

The Office for National Statistics say in total more than a third of the 1.4 million are
forced to work full time, as the cost of housing and bills like gas and 
electricity go through the roof.

They also say the pensioner population has not grown enough since 1993 to explain the rise.

It also appears more older people in London and the South East work than elsewhere, with around 14 per cent in those areas having to get paid employment to support their pensions.

In the north east of England and Northern Ireland fewer have to work, around 8 per cent, the figures show.

'The number of people working beyond state pension age has almost doubled,' the ONS said today, adding: 'The number of these workers has risen at a faster rate than the population.

'There may be many factors influencing the decision for more people to work past retirement such as financial pressures, people living longer and wanting to remain active in society and others.

'Those remaining in the labour market work
fewer hours, possibly helped by the financial support of their state 
pension and other pension arrangements, which allows them to fit their 
work around other engagements,' the ONS said.

The research found 32% of the working pensioners were self-employed, double the amount of under-60s.

While two out of three employed directly had been working for a business for ten years or more and just carried on after their retirement was due.

Around two-thirds of the men worked in jobs classed as higher skilled, 
such as property managers, marketing and sales directors, production 
managers and chief executives, but almost two-thirds of women 
worked in lower skilled jobs.

Of all the work carried out by men, the two most common were farmers and
taxi drivers, while for women the most common job was cleaning, 
followed by administration assistants, care workers and retail 
assistants.Â
