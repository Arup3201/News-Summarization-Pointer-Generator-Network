In action: Moses Sesay is pictured during the road race time trial at the Commonwealth Games

Sierra 
Leone's team chief insists he will take his athletes home on Tuesday 
despite some saying they do not want to go due to the ebola outbreak.

A
 public health emergency has been declared in the African country and 
several athletes have told Unisa Deen Kargbo they do not want to fly 
home.

Sierra
 Leone cyclist Moses Sesay, 32, was admitted to a Glasgow hospital last 
week after feeling unwell and doctors tested him for various conditions,
 including Ebola — which is blamed for more than 720 deaths in four 
countries.

Sesay
 was given the all clear and released from hospital but Kargbo said: 
‘Athletes have come to me and said they don’t want to return because of 
the Ebola situation. There have been discussions with people back home 
to see what the final decision will be on that.

‘I have a mandate to return the athletes on August 5 and that’s what I’m working towards now.’

Asked
 if the athletes could stay on in the UK, he said: ‘The UK government 
will have to decide if that’s an option but I don’t know.’

Glasgow
 2014 communications director Jackie Brock-Doyle said: ‘The athletes’ 
village closes on Wednesday and is being decommissioned on Thursday, so 
it will become a building site within a matter of hours.

‘We had a meeting with the chef de mission and his plan to take his entire team back on Tuesday still stands.’

‘All of us
 are scared about going back,' he said. 'We have a three-month visa in 
our passports and if I have the opportunity, I will stay here until it 
ends.

‘It
 is scary over there. My mother is a medical nurse so she may have to 
treat people.  My wife is also doing work in the medical field.’

A West African official last night denied
 a report that another member of the team, believed to be Mr Sesay’s room
 mate in the village, had gone missing or that others had been 
hospitalised.

He said that officials in Glasgow were in contact with the High Commission in London over the timing of the team’s return and that they still planned to take part in the Closing Ceremony on Sunday.

No special precautions had been taken inside the athlete’s village and they were sharing facilities with other teams, he added.

It is the second Commonwealth Games that Mr Sesay, who trains in South Africa, has attended having competed in Delhi, India, four years ago.

Officials stressed there had been no positive tests for Ebola in Scotland but refused to comment on negative tests. 

Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, that affects humans as 
well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees.

The virus is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals

Once a person becomes infected, the disease can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen.

The Ebola virus is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and there is no vaccine and no known cure.
