A teenager was taking photographs in fields near his home in Cornwall when he spotted what he believes may be the legendary beast of Bodmin Moor.

Henry Warren, 19, said: 'I was taking pictures of our new house when I saw something run across the field and in front of my lens.

'It was absolutely massive and was hopping up and down like a large cat - there's no way it was a fox or a dog.'

Legendary Beast of Bodmin Moor or runaway pet dog?  Student Henry Warren, 19, took this picture in Cornwall

Mr Warren managed to take several frames before the animal disappeared into undergrowth in the field at Gwinear, just a few miles from remote Bodmin Moor where the phantom wildcat is said to roam. 

He said: 'It ran around 60 metres in just a few seconds and was leaping in the air with its front two legs first.

'I did some research and thought it may be linked to the Beast of Bodmin - it certainly looks like a big cat.' 

Britain’s most famous big cat was first allegedly spotted in 1983, since when there have been more than 60 reported sightings.  In 1995 it was declared a phantom by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food conducted an official investigation into the 'beast' and other unknown animals reported to be roaming Britain in 1995.

What on earth is it? This picture, taken at Gwinear by Mr Warren, shows a feline-looking animal on the run

It concluded
 there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic felines loose in Britain. 
 But it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats
 were 'not present'. 

In
 2005, a skull with large fangs and what was thought to be the remains 
of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to the moor.

The
 skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for 
verification, where it was decided that it was a genuine skull from a 
young male leopard.  They also found that the cat had not died in 
Britain.

In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug.
