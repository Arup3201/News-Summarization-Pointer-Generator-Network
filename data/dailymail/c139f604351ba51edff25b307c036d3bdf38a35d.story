A cannabis-smoking teenage driver has been jailed for 20 months for killing a schoolgirl friend, 15, and a 55-year-old as he tried to overtake on a dark bend. 

Daniel Watts, 19, of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, was sentenced to 20 months in prison yesterday for killing passenger Shannley Leaver, 15, and driver Ronald Gates, 55, in the head-on crash.

Now, the father of the 15-year-old girl has urged young people not to drive 'like idiots' and called for a restriction on the number of passengers young drivers are allowed to carry.

Shaun Leaver also criticised the length of the sentence for being too short. 

Cannabis-smoking teenage driver Daniel Watts has been jailed for killing two in a crash in October 2013

Passenger Shannley Leaver, 15, was killed following the collision along the A12 at Frostenden, Suffolk

In December, father-to-be Watts admitted causing their deaths by careless driving.

The court heard he passed his driving test just 10 months before the fatal collision on October 8 2013.  

On the day of the collision he decided to go to Ipswich from Great Yarmouth to pick up a car part.

Before this journey he had never ventured more than five miles from home in his Citroen Saxo car.

He invited Shannley Leaver and two other young people - Brodie Jones and Sam Duffy - to go with him.

A witness statement from Brodie Jones revealed they had been smoking cannabis.

However, Judge John Devaux said no-one could conclusively prove this had played a part in the crash.  

Mr Gates was driving southbound with his wife Ann in their Peugeot 106 when Watts, driving on the wrong side of the road, ploughed into their car along the A12 at Frostenden, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, at about 8.30pm.

The teenager's car was sent spinning in to the air by the force of the collision and flipped over.

Watts was sentenced to 20 months in jail yesterday and also banned from driving for two years

Shannley, who attended Lynn Grove High School in Gorleston, was described by her heartbroken father as 'outgoing, fun-loving and lovely'

Mr Gates, of Knodishall, Suffolk, and Shannley both died after suffering multiple injuries, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

Watts was airlifted to hospital with a broken foot, shattered pelvis, broken leg and dislocated shoulder.

He was treated for five weeks before being allowed home.

Mr Gates' wife Ann and the two other passengers in Watts' car also suffered serious injuries.

As well as receiving 20 months in prison, Watts was also banned from driving for two years.

Simon Gladwell, defending Watts, said he took 'full responsibility' and was 'totally remorseful' for the deaths and injuries he had caused.

He said Watts genuinely had no recollection of the collision but a black box in his car for insurance purposes showed he had not been speeding prior to the collision. 

He said Watts had no previous convictions and his girlfriend was pregnant.  

Shaun Leaver has urged young people not to drive 'like idiots' and criticised the length of the sentence

Shannley, who attended Lynn Grove High School in Gorleston, was last night described by her heartbroken father as 'outgoing, fun-loving and lovely'.

Mr Leaver, of Yarmouth, said there were 'no words to describe the devastating effect' her tragic death had had on their family.

Mr Gates’ mother Maureen Gates said that while her son’s death would have a lasting impact on her family, Watts would be released from his sentence after 10 months and could then get on with his life.
