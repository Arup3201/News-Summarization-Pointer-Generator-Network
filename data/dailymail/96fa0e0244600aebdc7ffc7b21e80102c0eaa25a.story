Teenagers suffered 'horrific injuries' at a 16th birthday party when they were attacked by a group of gatecrashers wielding crowbars.

Eight party-goers had to be taken to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital after the party in Maesbrook, Shropshire, was raided.

A police riot van, seven patrol cars and three ambulances were called to the sleepy village when the party erupted in violence.

Several youngsters took shelter in a 
local pub while raiders smashed the girl's windows and attacked guests 
with crowbars and broken bottles on Friday night.

Phil Bewley, landlord of the nearby Black 
Horse pub, helped dozens of teenagers escape the violence.

He said: 'Someone could have easily died. It's lucky someone didn't get seriously, seriously hurt.

'One lad was hit by a car as he 
tried to run away, one was hit over the head by a crowbar, one was hit 
over the head with a bottle.

'There were six or seven police cars here, a couple of ambulances, a riot van, all down the road.

'Pretty crazy for Maesbrook. It's not the family's fault. What should have been a quiet party with a few friends just escalated.'

It is not believed the birthday girl's parents were at home at the time of the party.

Police said a large group of uninvited 16 to 18-year-olds were involved and West Mercia Police are now investigating incidents of assault and criminal damage to the girl's house and two cars.

A 17-year-old youth was arrested on suspicion of assault and has been bailed pending further inquiries.

Sean Fogarty, a parent of one of the party-goers, said: 'A much older group of youths, up to 20 years old, burst into the house with crowbars.

'The youngsters just got horrific injuries. My daughter's boyfriend needed seven stitches, another child is temporarily deaf after being clouted with a bottle.

'All of them are traumatised and distraught.'

West Midlands Ambulance Service sent three ambulances and a rapid response car to the scene just after 10.30pm.

A spokesperson said: 'In addition to the patients taken to hospital by ambulance, two more were treated at the scene and another was taken to hospital by a friend.'

A West Mercia Police spokesman said: 'The disorder arose after a number of uninvited people arrived. As a result, police are investigating incidents of assault and criminal damage to two cars and to a house.

'West Mercia Police are continuing to investigate and have not ruled out further arrests.'
