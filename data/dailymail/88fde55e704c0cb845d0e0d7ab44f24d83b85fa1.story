A Manhattan nanny accused of stabbing two children to death has claimed to have no memory of the killings, asking, 'who did that to them?' when confronted with gory images of their bloodied bodies.

Yoselyn Ortega's attorney revealed that the grisly photos of six-year-old Lucia Krim and her two-year-old brother, Leo, failed to jar her client.

'These photos are very graphic,' Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg said after an evidence hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday.

Denial: Yoselyn Ortega, who is accused of 
killing 2 children in her care last year, is pictured in court in July. 
She has claimed she had nothing to do with it and acted 
surprised when she saw images of their bodies

She said that after showing Ortega the images, 'she turns to me and says, "Oh, my God, who did that to 
them?" She has no mind, no memory of the 
incident', the New York Daily News reported.

Ortega has claimed she had nothing to do with the grisly deaths of Lucia and Leo in their parents' Upper West Side apartment in October 2012.

Their mother, Marina, returned home with her other daughter, then three, to find their tiny bodies in the bathtub with Ortega allegedly slitting her own throat next to them in an attempt to take her life.

Ortega, a 50-year-old Dominican immigrant, has been charged with murder but maintains she is innocent. A judge has declared her mentally fit to stand trial.

On Thursday, she appeared in court 
wearing a gray sweatshirt with the scar to her neck still visible. She 
stayed silent throughout the hearing, the Daily News reported.

She was ordered to return to court on December 12 for another pretrial conference.

Loss: Lulu Krim was found murdered in the bathtub at her family's Upper West Side home in October 2012

Missed: Two-year-old Leo Krim was also stabbed to death in the bathtub and found by his mother

In June, she claimed in an interview that she had nothing to do with the deaths, saying, 'I didn't do that. Someone else did.'

When Ortega was questioned by police after awaking from a coma, she had attempted to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the tragedy on her.

Ortega, who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, reportedly said she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and asked her to do the housework.

The Krims have since began to rebuild their lives. Last month, they welcomed a son, Felix.

'We are very excited to share with you 
that Felix Harrison Krim, all 8 pounds, 10 ounces, and 21.5 inches of 
him, arrived today. Marina, Felix and all of us are healthy and happy,' they wrote on Facebook.

Family: Marina and Kevin Krim have since welcomed another son, who was born last month

Looking to the future: Kevin Krim spoke on Wednesday evening at a fundraiser for their nonprofit, the Lulu and Leo Fund, named after their children. They thanked friends and family for their support

And earlier this week, they held a fundraiser for their nonprofit, the Lulu and Leo Fund,

In a rare public speech at the event, Kevin Krim said that the couple found a reason to go on by leaning on each other, and their friends and family.

'We had every reason to feel alienated from the world after this happened,' he said. 'And to really, truly survive and to live again, we had to have a reason to live.'

He said they miss their children every day, and they will forever.

'We are just heartbroken,' he said. 'But they inspire us every day as well. Their lives give us a purpose.'
