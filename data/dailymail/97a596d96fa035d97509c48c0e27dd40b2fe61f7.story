A British housewife has been chosen from millions to knit a new outfit for NASA's latest astronaut...Camilla the rubber chicken.

Camilla has already flown on a Nasa T-38 training jet, traveled aboard a helium balloon to the stratosphere over Louisiana in the U.S. and visited the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia.

Now on her latest mission, she’ll be braving space covered in a protective orange and white outfit knitted from plastic bags by Sue Drage, from Rugby, Warwickshire.

Honour: Housewife Sue Drage is the first person from outside the US to be given the chance to knit a new outfit for Nasa's chicken astronaut Camilla

Pioneer: Camilla the rubber chicken is Nasa's latest astronaut.  Her aim is to engage more young people with the space programme

Sue, 63, has knitted with plastic, newspapers and cardboard for a hobby for years.

But it wasn’t until she was contacted by her local radio station that she was asked to knit the spacesuit for Camilla.

Camilla is being used by NASA as a way to connect youngsters with the space programme and science.

To date, the chicken has more than has more than 20,000 followers of Twitter, Facebook and Google+.

Sue said she was honoured and surprised to have been chosen to make a costume that would hopefully be seen by millions round the world.

She said: “I got the call from NASA through my local radio station last Friday and now I’m just about finished making the suit, it should be done by Sunday.

'I didn’t even know who Camilla the chicken was - I thought she was a live chicken, I didn’t know she was rubber.

'I’ve had to buy a rubber chicken to make sure I get the sizes right, and I’ve used about 10 plastic bags so far in the suit.

Surprise:  Sue Drage could not believe it when Nasa contacted her and asked her to knit a space suit for Camilla

'I’m hoping it’ll provide some protection when she’s out there in space or wherever she goes.

'Just think when you see her, she’ll be wearing simple housewife Sue from Rugby’s outfit.

'I feel like a rocket scientist or something.”

Sue, who lives with her husband Richard, began her intergalatic fashion journey after being called by BBC Coventry and Warickshire’s Vic Minett who had contacted NASA.

Ms Minett said: 'I always wanted to be an astronaut when I was a kid and when we heard about Camilla the chicken and NASA we got Romeo on the show to talk about it and he mentioned she wore a knitted suit.

'We'd just done a knit-a-thon for charity so we knew lots of knitters and we had heard about Sue making outfits from recycled materials.

'We thought it'd be amazing to have one of our listeners knit a suit for Camilla.

'When we told Romeo he was over the moon and really excited about it, and in a way my dream of getting to space has come true.'

Nasa’s Romeo Durscher, who is Camilla's official keeper, said Sue was the first person from outside the U.S. to have been given the honour of clothing the astronaut chicken.

He said: 'We want to make Camilla almost like a real person, this will actually be the first time we have had an outfit done from outside the U.S. so this would be the most special.

'When Sue and I talked I asked her to add something from the UK to the suit so it’s a real reminder when people see it they will ask ‘so why is this NASA chicken wearing something from the UK?’

'This means we can tell the story which really is beautiful that now we have all these friends in the UK help us make this outreach and educational tool even stronger.'
