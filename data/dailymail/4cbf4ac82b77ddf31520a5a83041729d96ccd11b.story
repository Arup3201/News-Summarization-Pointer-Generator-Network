As the bitter civil war in Syria rages, these photos show just how desperate the rebels are to fight back against the government.

A makeshift rocket - compiled of debris scavenged from the rubble-strewn streets - shows a crowd of Free Syrian Army fighters frantically trying to construct weapons in their fight against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

A gas canister and a scaffold pole have been hastily assembled and carted along in the back of a tractor, before the battered container is launched into the air.

Their desperate measures to retaliate come after the British government has announced a further £100 million in humanitarian funding

Children run past the men, some of whom are in uniforms, others in their civilian clothes and trainers, who gather around their home-made weapon in Ashrafieh, Aleppo.

The rebels, who want to overthrow their defiant leader, have continued to wage war in a battle that began with a nationwide uprising in 2011.

Since then thousands have been killed, deadly chemical weapons deployed and continuous fighting in the streets.

Despite the ongoing fighting, pain and global uproar at the pain and suffering caused to innocent civilians, neither the rebels nor Assad refuse to back down in their quest to control the country.

The rebels' army's desperate measures to retaliate come after the British government has announced a further £100 million ($160.7 million) in humanitarian funding to help bring food, water and medicine to those affected by Syria's civil war.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the funding Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, saying that as the international community seeks a political solution to the crisis, it mustn't ignore the needs of ordinary Syrians.

He said there is a 'huge gap' in humanitarian funding for Syria and urged other nations present at the assembly to meet the shortfall.

The new funding means Britain has now committed 500 million pounds to the Syrian humanitarian crisis.

One day earlier, the U.S. announced $339 million in additional humanitarian aid to refugees and countries affected by the war.

Oxfam's chief executive Mark Goldring said: 'We welcome the UK Government's extremely generous commitment of an extra £100 million of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.

'This money will make a real difference in getting basics such as food, water and medicine to many vulnerable Syrians.

'The UK Government is showing international leadership on supporting the UN appeal which is still less than half funded. The UK Government has acted, now other countries must follow.'
