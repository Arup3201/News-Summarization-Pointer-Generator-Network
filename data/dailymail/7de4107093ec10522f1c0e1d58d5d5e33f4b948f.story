A Dallas police officer who shot at an unarmed man 41 times has been indicted for manslaughter.

Patrick Tuter, 33, a former Garland police officer, killed Michael Vincent Allen in August last year following a car chase.

On Monday a Grand Jury took the decision to indict Tuter, who was fired from the force after he was deemed to have violated their use of force policy.

Patrick Tuter, a former Garland police officer, has been indicted on a charge of manslaughter by a Grand Jury, the first time in 15 years that an officer has been charged over a fatal shooting

It is the first time in 15 years that an officer has been indicted for a fatal shooting while on duty.

On August 31 Tuter spotted Allen's white GMC pickup and recognised it as having been involved in a chase with Sachse police.

He tried to stop the vehicle, but Allen fled, leading to a half hour chase that only ended when Tuter opened fire.

The former officer had tried to claim that Allen rammed into a police vehicle while cops were trying to box him in, however video footage taken from a dash camera has since revealed that officers actually rammed Allen.

Tuter then opened fire, letting off 41 rounds and hitting Allen, from Wylie, three times which killed him.

Tuter initially claimed he opened fire after Michael Vincent Allen rammed police vehicles while they tried to box him in. However footage shot from a dashboard camera showed police actually rammed Allen

According to witness reports from the time, Tuter reloaded his pistol at least once.

Mitchell Wallace, who lived in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, told The Dallas Morning News last year that he was asleep when the gunshots began.

He said: 'There was a pause in between the firing that made me believe he was reloading. From the time they yelled, "Get out, get out," they didn’t give him three seconds to get out.'

In a separate incident officer Cardan Spencer, another Dallas policeman, was fired from the force after shooting Bobby Bennett, a mentally ill man with a knife who had said he wanted police to kill him.

Again video played an important role after authorities initially said that Bennett had aggressively come at the officers with the knife raised.

However a neighbor’s surveillance video showed that Bennett was standing still with his arms at his sides.
