Teachers at a Los Angeles high school have found a unique way to educate students about social media etiquette, by reading aloud mean tweets written about themselves by people in their class.

In a hilarious video the teachers read out the offensive statements ridiculing their habits and appearances, as the tweets flash up below.

One reads: 'mr.kerns needs to cut that piece of hair before i get up and snip it off. #ratchet' (sic)'

On the video, Mr. Kerns is seen reading the actual tweet off his phone, giving a puzzled look after he finishes.

In another tweet, Mr. Smith is ridiculed 
for his apparent nosehair problem. 'Mr. Smith is so tall that whenever I
 talk to him I end up looking up his nostrils. #nosehairs. Nice. Nice.'

Through the nearly 3-minute video, REM's 1990s hit 'Everybody Hurts' plays in the background.

The idea for the video actually came from three students in a video production class at  Los Alamitos High School in Los Alamitos, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, according to the Orange County Register.

Although the tweets were mostly scripted, Conner Brown, Mallory Sullivan and Josh Vulcano, all 17, told the newspaper they are based on the kinds of comments they read on sites like Twitter.

Another teacher is made fun of for his apparent love of pickles. 'why is mr.jones so obsessed with pickles? #childhoodmemories?' the tweet reads. In the video, Mr. Jones reads the tweet while holding a plush pickle with a moustache and cowboy hat.

The video was produced for Griffin News, a newscast run by students at the school. Since the segment was posted on YouTube on March 2, the video has more than 502,000 hits.

Sullivan said he borrowed the idea from the late night show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' in which celebrities read mean tweets about themselves in a popular segment.

Although the video is quite humorous, the point it makes is a serious one, says Principal Joshua Arnold. 'A bad day will go away, but a bad tweet lasts forever.'

Not all of the tweets read aloud by teachers are necessariy negative. In one, a student praises Mrs. Franzen's class â€” but not because of her teaching ability or the subject matter. 'the only thing i like about mrs franzen's class is the way it smells. #cocoabutter' that tweet says.

And in another, a teacher who is easy on the eyes gets asked out in a tweet. 'i hope mr courtemarche asks me to the prom #sohot.'
