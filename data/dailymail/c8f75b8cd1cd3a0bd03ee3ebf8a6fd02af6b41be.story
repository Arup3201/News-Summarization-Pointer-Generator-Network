As the Australian Open swings into the final 'game, set, match' there's one dog who's sure to be lapping up the action.

YouTube user Bearaids from Minnesota says his Golden Retriever Georges is such a fan of the sport he will sit in front of the television all day.

Indeed, a video of the pooch shot this week shows him excitedly leaping up and down as balls fly though the air on screen.

Even after three minutes of bouncing George does not appear to tire.

His owner says he loves watching all sports but tennis is his favorite.

Other clips show him engrossed in last year's World Cup football  and the semi-finals of Wimbledon 2013.

Many viewers have deemed the pup's energetic antics 'cute' and 'adorable'.

When he's not watching sports TV, Georges enjoys everyday dog activities such as walking and fetching sticks.
