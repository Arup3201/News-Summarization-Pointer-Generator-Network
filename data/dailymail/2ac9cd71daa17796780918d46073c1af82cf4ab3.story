Planning a wedding is a major undertaking for any couple... but not for Nisansala and Nalin from Sri Lanka who married this week at a Guinness World Record breaking ceremony near the capital city of Colombo.

The bride and groom had a staggering 126 bridesmaids - easily beating the previous record of 96 held by a Thai couple - all dressed by Nisansala's sister-in-law Champi Siriwardana, who first suggested they go for the world record bid.

Of course it probably helped that Champi happens to be one of the Asian island's leading wedding planners and dress designers.

It also didn't hurt that the guest of honour was Sri Lanka's First Lady, Shiranthi Rajapaksa, wife of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The spectacular ceremony was elaborately staged at the Avendra
Gardens in Negombo, 30 kms from Colombo in front of hundreds of family and friends.

All of the wedding party - bride, groom, 
126 bridesmaids, 25 best men, 20 page boys and 23 flower girls - were 
dressed in richly embroidered traditional costumes in shades of purple 
and gold.

Held under strict Guinness Book of World Record conditions, the wedding breaks the previous record, held by a wedding in Bangkok, Thailand, that included 96 bridesmaids.

'Breaking the Guinness world record is no
mean feat and one that I cannot achieve alone,' said Champi, who suggested the world record attempt.

'It is a great 
responsibility and challenge. There can be no mistakes.'

Champi was so confident of Nisansala and Nalin's world record, she held a press conference before the big day to announce the event.

'My dream is to create an impact not only in Sri Lanka but internationally as well,' said Champi.

Job done, Champi.

As for the happy couple... the pictures speak for themselves.
