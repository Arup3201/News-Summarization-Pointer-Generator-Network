Victory: Matthew Feroze, 30, defeated 15 competitors and became the first foreigner to win a bi-annual cheese competition in Lyon

An English civil servant has been awarded the title of France’s most expert cheesemonger.

Matthew Feroze, 30, defeated 15 competitors and became the first foreigner to win a bi-annual cheese competition in Lyon.

Mr Feroze, who is on a two-year sabbatical from his job as a Government accountant in London, has been a professional cheese refiner and seller for just one year.

‘There was some surprise, certainly,’ he told the Independent.

‘But the members of the jury and the competitors were very encouraging and friendly. If there was any resentment, they did not show it.’

Mr Feroze had to present a cheese platter that he had selected and matured himself as part of the Concours National des Fromagers at the Salon Mondiale de Restauration et Hôtellerie.

He also had to blind taste cheeses and cut slices to specified weights.

The self-proclaimed Francophile included two English cheeses in his platter of 25 - a Stilton and a West Country cheddar.

Organiser Catherine Bonnetaud said: ‘He was best, that’s all you can say. He worked hard on his presentations, with great passion and knowledge.’

Mr Feroze took a sabbatical from his government job in 2011 and found work with one of Lyon’s most well-known cheese shops, the Fromagerie Mons-Etienne Boissy.

‘I fell in love with France, and French cheese, when I came to Lyon to learn French after university,’ Mr Feroze said.

‘There is something very deep and rich about cheese and about the people involved in cheese.

'You will never make your fortune out of cheese. It attracts people who have a real passion for what they do.’

The accountant, who describes himself as a ‘food obsessed Francophile chasing the cheese dream’, said he may now reconsider his career choice.

‘In view of the way things are going,’ he said, ‘I am considering looking for a new career in cheese.’
