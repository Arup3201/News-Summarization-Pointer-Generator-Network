Leading car experts say vehicles could be driving themselves within the next four years as driverless car technology continues to show 'great promise'.

Larry Burns, who is advising the self-driving project for Google, is confident driverless cars would be popular within just a few years, but believes the real challenge would be regulations and consumers getting used to the new systems.

'Most of the true leaders in this field say by 2017-2018 the car will be able to drive itself, anywhere, anytime without any human input,' Mr Burns told the ABC.

Driverless cars could be on the streets by 2017 as technology continues to show increasing promise, experts say

'I think it's going to be very compelling, I think it's going to grow to a very large scale over a couple of decades.'

The former vice president of General Motors was in Adelaide to give a talk on the future of the car.

Mr Burns said cars that move people around busy CBDs without anyone at the wheel would gain popularity once people realise how easy the mode of transportation is.

'The way to get past those hurdles really is just to get out and start trying it on a small scale and learn and show people it's possible,' he said.

He said safety would be a huge selling point to get driverless cars as a mainstream vehicle.

'Basically the car makes two simple decisions simultaneously, "How fast should I go and which way should I steer?", he said.

'Once you get the driver out of the loop the vehicle becomes much, much safer. Traffic safety experts say about 90 percent of crashes are due to human error.

'If cars don't crash we can now tailor their design to the typical trip we take, which is one and two person. That allows us to have a much smaller vehicle, which is much more energy-efficient, space efficient.'

Penny Gale from the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia said they were eyeing potential opportunities for car manufacturing.

'The ideas we're talking about might create new opportunities... Whether we build the driverless cars here in South Australia or build the robots that will help build those vehicles, it shows a lot of promise,' Ms Gale said.
