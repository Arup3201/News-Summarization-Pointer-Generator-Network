A three-year-old girl has taken her first paragliding flight after her father strapped the daredevil toddler to his chest and took to the air - climbing to a height of 6,500 feet.

Luisa Broschart clung tightly to her 49-year-old father Mik throughout the flight as the pair soared above the lush Bavarian hills of Lenggries in southern Germany for more than 20 minutes.

Mr Broschart said Luisa had been pestering her father to take her paragliding with him ever since she could speak, but until now she wasn't big enough to fit into the safety harness.

Her first experience certainly seemed to live up to expectations too, with her father saying Luisa's words immediately upon landing landing were 'One more flight!'.

Describing his daughter's experience, Mr Broschart said:'Luisa absolutely loved it - the first thing she said when we landed was: "One more flight!"...She couldn't wait to take off.'

Luisa's first paragliding flight was the product of more than two years of pestering her father to take her up with him whenever the weather was clear.

The pleading became even more intense when Luisa's five-year-old sister Emilia grew large enough to fit into the safety harness and was able to take to the skies herself.

'She's been pestering me for the last two years but she hasn't been big enough for the harness until now', Mr Broschart said.

'I never had to force her to come flying. She always said "Hey daddy, the weather is nice, I want to go flying",' he added.

Excited: Luisa pictured on her way to the paragliding site.  The three-year-old has been desperate to take to the air ever since her older sister Emilia, five, grew large enough to fit into the safety harness and fly with her father

Finally, after more than two years of waiting, Luisa is now able to fit securely into the safety harness and was able take to the skies for a full 20 minutes strapped to her father's chest.

As soon as the glider landed she pleaded her with father to go up again, before running over to her mother Kristine to tell her all about the experience. 

Mrs Broschart, 42, had given her blessing to the flight - but insisted her daughter wait until the conditions were absolutely perfect to ensure there was no risk whatsoever.

Now that Luisa has had her first taste of paragliding, the only difficulty now is keeping her feet on the ground.

'Emilia has been up with me regularly for the last two years so I'm sure Luisa will want to catch up on her flying time over the next few years,' Mr Broschart said.
