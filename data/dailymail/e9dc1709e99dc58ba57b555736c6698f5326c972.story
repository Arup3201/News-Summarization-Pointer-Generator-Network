The policeman shot and blinded by Raoul Moat has formed a close friendship with a survivor of the 7/7 terror attacks.

Pc David Rathband, 43, has been photographed out with Lisa French days after splitting with his wife.

Lisa French, 34, who was seriously injured in a blast on board a bus six years ago, was introduced to Pc Rathband at a charity event, the Sunday Mirror reported.

The pair were pictured out walking together days after the officer announced on Twitter that he was divorcing Kath, 41, after 20 years.

Pc Rathband, a father-of-two, was blinded after being shot in the face by Raoul Moat while he was sat in his police patrol car.

Lisa, who was a BT human resources manager, was knocked unconscious by the bomb which killed 12 people on the No 30 bus in Tavistock Square in July 2005.

Miss French lives close to Pc Rathband in Newcastle and was on a trip down to London six years ago when she was caught up in the atrocity.

She told the 7/7 inquest how she decided not to sit next to bomber Hasib Hussain, 18, because she had her laptop with her and didn't think there would be space as he had such a large bag.

Instead, Miss French sat four rows in front of him on the upper deck. She suffered perforated eardrums as well as broken teeth, cuts and bruises in the blast – and described herself as ‘very lucky’.

Pc Rathband separated from his wife after being arrested on suspicion of assault by his colleagues in Northumbria Police.

The former traffic officer was spoken to at the scene and officers gave the couple advice before leaving. No further action was taken.

The couple remained in contact with one another and appeared to be rebuilding their marriage.

However, two weeks ago he wrote on Twitter: 'Sad to announce Mrs R has called time on our marriage. Separation permanent.'

In response, minutes later she Tweeted: 'Slight inaccuracy in the tweet by @pcdavidrathband - He left us and refuses to come home.'

Just a day later Pc Rathband was pictured out with Lisa French near his home.

PC Rathband was shot twice at close range by Moat as he sat in his traffic car at a roundabout in the West Denton area of Newcastle in July last year.

He was left with more than 200 pellets lodged in his skull yet gave evidence at the trial of Moat’s two accomplices, Karl Ness and Qhuram Awan. Both were jailed in March this year.

Since then PC Rathband, who has won bravery awards, has launched his own charity, the Blue Lamp Foundation, to help emergency service personnel injured in the line of duty.

Raoul Moat shot himself after being cornered by officers.
