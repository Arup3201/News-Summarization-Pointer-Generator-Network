Rangers legend David Robertson warned the Ibrox board they missed a trick by throwing out American financier Robert Sarver’s £20million takeover bid for the crisis club.

Earlier this month, Rangers directors rejected the Phoenix Suns owner’s attempt to purchase a controlling stake - arguing he was unlikely to receive the necessary backing of 75 per cent of shareholders.

But Phoenix-based Robertson, who suggested to the businessman that he buy Rangers after coaching one of his children at football, criticised the board for not acting in the club’s best interests.

David Robertson feels Rangers have missed out by rejecting Robert Sarver's bid for the club

When asked if it was a missed opportunity, the 46-year-old said: ‘It is. I don’t know if I’m speaking out of turn but I know it’s a fantastic opportunity, and I’m sure there could have been ways to make it work. The shareholding piece of it didn’t work out but if those guys really had Rangers at heart they would have tried to find a way to make it work.

‘I don’t know if people want power or whatever, but the way I think the shareholdings are, there’s a lot of small shareholdings that all add up. It’s a difficult situation. He needed 75 per cent and they felt they couldn’t have got that. The shareholders really could have made it happen.’

Sarver had proposed to loan Rangers £6.5m up front after seeing his initial offer rejected on January 6, only for his second proposal to be blocked on January 12. But Robertson, who won six league titles under Walter Smith during the nine-in-a-row era, believes Sarver would have turned Rangers into a force again.

‘He’s such an honest guy, whatever he says you can take as gospel,’ added Robertson, speaking at the SFA’s UEFA Pro Licence course at Hampden. 

‘He had visions of getting Rangers back to where they were and even further. He’s obviously disappointed but he feels he’s the guy who could turn the place around.’

Robertson is unsure if the basketball franchise owner will launch another bid. Asked if Sarver could join forces with Dave King or the Three Bears, he said: ‘I don’t know. He was prepared to invest a lot in it. I talk to him now and again. He’s never going to give too much away. He’s obviously very interested but he’s got banks to look after, the Phoenix Suns and the Phoenix Mercury. He was very, very serious about Rangers.

Rangers are in financial difficulties and the future of the club is uncertain

‘He is by the book and straight talking. He’s not going to go around doing anything dodgy behind the scenes. I know him better than most. When somebody like him knocks on your door, I find it hard to understand why they didn’t open it.

‘He was prepared to invest a lot. On and off the field he could have done so much. I know Rangers as a club - even on the business side of it - are not operating to full capacity. Whoever ends up in control, you just hope there’s a good, solid plan.’

After Craig Whyte and Charles Green, it’s perhaps understandable Rangers were wary of a foreign investor appearing from nowhere. But Robertson argued it wouldn’t have been difficult to establish Sarver’s credibility.

‘With technology these days, it doesn’t take long to work out what a good guy he is. My daughter goes to school in Tucson - the University of Arizona - and he’s got the Sarver Heart Center there, so he does a lot of good, a lot of charity work. The Suns do a lot of charity stuff.

‘I run a club in Phoenix and his kids play within the club, I coach one of them. He’s just like any other parent, stands on the sidelines and cheers his kids on. He’s a down-to-earth guy and has been very generous to our club.’

Mike Ashley has been linked with a takeover but his ties with Newcastle could complicate matters

Sarver the basketball chief has an impressive record with the Suns, winning three successive NBA titles between 2005 and 2007.

‘He’s just a winner,’ said Robertson. ‘He’s obviously got the wealth to invest in a club - at some point he will - but he’s also got the infrastructure. You’ve got to meet tough guidelines with the franchise every year, every week.

‘Before I started talking to him, he was looking at other clubs in Spain and England. I mentioned Rangers and the problems they are in, and, having been there and seen what’s happened, he’s the type they need. He loves the passion that the club and the supporters have. He’s had loads of messages, thank yous — he’ll definitely remember Rangers for a long time.’
