Ronnie and Reggie Kray were both gay and Ronnie never consummated his marriage, according to  new claims made by an ex-enforcer for the pair.

Former villain Freddie ‘Brown Bread’ Foreman, 83, has been sharing tales of the east London violent gangsters with A-Lister Tom Hardy – who is set to star as both twins in a new film.

He claims that although Ronnie admitted his homosexuality in his mid-teens, his brother Reggie was also gay and his marriage to Frances Shea was a sham.

Reggie Kray married Frances Shea in 1965, but just two years later she committed suicide. Mr Foreman has described the marriage as a sham and says it was never consummated

He told The Sun: ‘The marriage was never even consummated. That poor girl was a trophy wife, nothing more.’

Frances, who was 16 when she met Reggie, married him in 1965 but two years after their wedding, she committed suicide aged 23.

After the honeymoon in Athens she moved back in with her mother and is said to have tried to end their marriage after eight months.

Bradley Allardyce, one of Reggie’s prison friends, later claimed he had told him that Ronnie had murdered Frances by forcing her to swallow pills.

Speaking of the new movie, entitled Legend, Foreman said: ‘The film apparently has Reggie looking out of his prison window and saying ‘I love you Frances’. But he certainly did not love her like a husband loves a wife. They never had sex.’

He also revealed for the first time the gang started by the brothers, known as The Firm, had plans to execute the brothers just before their arrests.

‘The twins were a nuisance and causing grief for everyone else. Some people felt they had to go,’ he said.

‘If they hadn't been nicked then they would have gone missing very soon afterwards – for ever.’

Foreman, who was convicted of disposing of the body of Jack ‘the Hat’ McVitie, also offered first-hand advice to actor Tom Hardy on Thursday during filming for the new movie.

He told Mr Hardy that Reggie often had a ‘quizzical look’ while Ronnie would ‘stare into space’.

The pensioner admitted that Hardy had ‘nailed the part’ and said it was like being with a Kray twin in the flesh.

The twins were born on October 24, 1933 and grew up in a slum area of Bethnal Green.

Talented amateur boxers, the pair developed a reputation in the East End by the time they were 21.

After opening a club in Mile End, they began demanding money from criminals, and by the early 1960s they were making up to the equivalent of £10million every year.

They were jailed for life in March 1969, when their crimes caught up with them.

Ronnie was 61 when he died of a heart attack at Broadmoor Hospital in 1995 while Reggie was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2000 after he was diagnosed with cancer.

Legend, which is written and directed by Brian Helgeland, is planned for release in 2015.
