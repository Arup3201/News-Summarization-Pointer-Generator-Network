A jilted lover shot dead his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend on Sunday before turning the gun on himself.

Marie Hartman, 26, and firefighter Andrew Hoffman, 27, were killed at his Baltimore home in the early hours of Sunday by police officer Christopher Robinson who then took his own life.

Miss Hartman's teenage sister Brittany told police that she hid in the closet while she listened to the gunshots before fleeing.

Shocked relatives and friends gathered to mourn the couple following the tragic murder-suicide

The three had returned to Mr Hoffman's home around 1.30am after going to a Halloween party and picking up fast food.

Police believe that Robinson followed them and then went to Mr Hoffman's door. When the firefighter confronted the police officer, he was shot.

Brittany, 18, told police she heard screaming and more gunshots from her hiding place in a closet. She then climbed out of a window to escape.

Police found the bodies of the two men and woman at the home.

Miss Hartman was mother to a six-year-old son. Relatives and friends struggled to come to terms with the shocking deaths as they held a vigil for the couple on Sunday night.

Fred Scheper, 29, spoke of Mr Hoffman, telling the Baltimore Sun: 'That was my best friend. He saved people's lives every day.'

Mr Scheper said that he had never seen his friend as happy as in his relationship with Miss Hartman.

The family of Mr Hoffman, a third-generation firefighter, released this statement: 'Our hearts are absolutely broken over the loss of our son, brother, grandson and uncle.

Our beloved Andy dedicated his life to protecting and saving others with the Baltimore City Fire Department as a Firefighter/Paramedic. We have come to learn that he died doing the same thing, putting others first. 

'The only survivor of this horrific tragedy told us Andy tried to protect her and Marie, and because of that, he became the first victim.

'We have lost someone who meant so much to us and so many family members and friends. It’s hard to imagine going forward without him, but we know Andy died a hero. That is the way he lived his life and we couldn’t be prouder of him.'

Wayne Robinson, brother of the alleged shooter, said that the 37-year-old had been struggling to cope with his break-up from Miss Hartman in August.

However he said that he had no idea that he would become violent.

Wayne Robinson, a firefighter who was also a friend of victim Mr Hoffman, told the Sun: 'I don't know what happened last night, but the person that pulled that trigger wasn't the Chris that I know.'

Close family members and friends posted tributes to Robinson on his page on Sunday.

His mother Marian Moore-Robinson wrote: 'Chris was a great guy! What got him to go over there - we may never know. He had been out on a date, and was texting his ex-wife till midnight. I just don't understand. Three families are now broken. Why?'

Robinson, a Marines Corp veteran from Abingdon, went to the home at 1.30am on Sunday and shot the couple before killing himself, according to a police spokesman.

Miss Hartman's stepfather Ed Chaney told the Sun that she had dated the police officer on and off over the past year.

Mr Chaney said his stepdaughter had been receiving text messages from her ex-boyfriend pleading for her to give their relationship another chance.

Wayne Robinson said his brother became aware a few weeks ago that Miss Hartman was dating the firefighter.
