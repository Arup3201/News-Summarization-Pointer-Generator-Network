As the countdown to the 2016 presidential election builds momentum, Hillary Clinton is already a runaway favorite to move into the White House.

So, faced with 18 months of campaign events and non-stop political appearances, the former Secretary of State has opted to prepare by having a laid back summer vacation in a quiet hamlet in the Hamptons, according to the New York Times.

Even though Hillary has not formally confirmed whether she is running, she will head to Amagansett with her husband Bill over the summer.

Quiet: The East Hamptons town Amagansett boasts a beachside location with a number of restaurants

Affluent: The small community has a population of only 1,165, but boasts star-studded residents including Sarah Jessica Parker and Jerry Seinfeld

The small community at the end of Long Island, has a population of just 1,165, but boasts a history of star-studded residents and luxury properties.

Sarah Jessica Parker and Jerry Seinfeld 
live in multi-million dollar homes, while Paul McCartney, Gwyneth 
Paltrow, Chris Martin, Naomi Watts and even Marylin Monroe have owned 
second homes in the area in the past. 

The Clintons are returning after a visit 1998, which saw the former President dine with Hollywood stars Alec Baldwin and Kim Bassinger.

Around 1,000 guests paid 
$5,000 a head to attend the banquet.

The Hamptons is a favourite destination of the family and they have become a visible presence in the community every year.

Last year, the Clintons rented a house in the nearby village of Sagaponack, which boasts one of the country's wealthiest areas.

The sprawling property was worth $11million and was owned by Republican donor Michael Saperstein.

During their summers in the upmarket seaside resort, Mr. Clinton has wminiature golf outings with his niece and nephew has meals out with friends, and last year celebrated his 67th birthday with Paul McCartney and Jimmy Buffett, The New York Times reported.

In the two previous summers the family had stayed in an eight-bedroom house on Lily Pond Lane in  East Hampton owned by multi-millionaire Elie Hirshfeld, which was worth $19.95million.

Hillary is currently promoting her memoirs, Hard Choices, which reflects how the potential candidate may try to define her record as President 
Barack Obama's secretary of state while she considers another White 
House campaign.

She spent most of last summer writing the book in an office inside the Hamptons property, complete with a view of the ocean.

Polls have her well ahead of any other Democratic 
candidate, including Vice-President Joe Biden.

Biding her time? Hillary Clinton may have chosen the quiet Hamptons spot to prepare herself for the gruelling campaign trail in the lead up to 2016

The New Hampshire Primary is not until January 18, 2016, but the candidates will be looking to build their momentum over the next 12 months.
