David Cameron insists his promised EU referendum could not be brought forward because he needed time to 'renegotiate a better deal for Britain'

Britain will not get a say on leaving the European Union until 2017, after Downing Street rejected claims a referendum could be held next year.

Number 10 made clear there are 'absolutely no plans' to hold the referendum in 2016, after a minister was quoted as saying a vote next year was the 'preferred route'.

Prime Minister David Cameron told MailOnline the vote could not be brought forward because he needed time to 'renegotiate a better deal for Britain'.

However, Scottish and Welsh nationalists are demanding a veto on Britain leaving the EU, insisting every nation in the UK require a majority in favour of exit.

The Tories have promised that if they are returned to power, they will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

But with the Lib Dems opposed to the timetable, and a hung parliament a likely outcome of the election, there are doubts about whether the referendum will happen.

In an interview with MailOnline last week, Mr Cameron banged the table and insisted the vote would happen if he remains prime minister: 'Yes. By the end of 2017. Yes. Yes. Yes.'

But there have been calls for him to bring the vote forward, to end uncertainty and give the people a say on the EU as soon as possible.

Asked why the referendum cannot happen sooner, Mr Cameron replied: 'Because I want to renegotiate a better deal for Britain, I think people would rather have a choice between staying in a reformed Europe or getting out rather than I think the false choice of today which is stay in Europe we are not satisfied with or leave.'

Today the Sunday Times reported that how holding the vote in 2016 was under consideration in Number 10.

A source told the paper: 'A referendum in 2016 is very actively on the table. You would do a quick renegotiation, make a big statement at conference and get it done next year.'

However, the idea has been rejected by senior Downing Street figures who insist up to two years will be needed to secure a successful renegotiation with the other EU countries.

A No 10 source said: 'The Prime Minister has made a clear commitment to hold an in-out referendum on Europe by the end of 2017 - and the Conservatives are the only party that can and will deliver a referendum for the British people.

'But there are an absolutely no plans to hold the referendum in 2016.'

Mr Cameron has promised that if he is still Prime Minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

Under the plan, the decision on whether to stay in the EU would be decided on a straight majority of all the people in the UK.

Chancellor George Osborne today played down the idea of an earlier vote, and rejected the idea that offering a referendum has increased instability.

But Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has demanded that an outright majority in Scotland should be required.

The idea was backed today by Leanne Wood, leader of Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. 

He told Sky News' Murnaghan: 'My position is that the votes in each of the countries should be added up separately and we should only pull out of the EU if all four countries want to do that.

'We have had a lot of talk during the Scottish referendum about the UK being a family of nations. This is such a big decision that all members of the family need to be involved in taking that decision.'

Mr Cameron used a major speech in November to set out key demands on banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has been ordered to tour every European capital city before the election to build support for the Tory renegotiation.

Chancellor George Osborne played down the idea of an earlier vote. 'We would be delighted if we could conclude those negotiations sooner but we have set the end of 2017 as the deadline,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr.

'The essential issue here, and again it's something which is at stake in this general election, is do we want to change our relationship with Europe, do we want a Europe including a Britain that is job creating, that is opportunity creating.

'Do we want to make sure that non-Euro members like Britain have a fair relationship with the Eurozone, and do we want to make sure that the British people have a choice in a referendum.

'And you only get that from David Cameron and from the Conservatives in this election.'

He rejected the idea that offering a referendum has increased instability. 'We've received a huge amount of investment form around the world since we set out our policy.

'Actually business and investors are the first people who say we want a more competitive European Union and a more competitive Britain within that European Union.'
