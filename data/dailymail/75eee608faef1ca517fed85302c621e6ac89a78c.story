Lille boss Rene Girard has claimed that Belgian forward Divock Origi is as good as Everton pair Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o.

The 19-year-old joined Liverpool in a £10million summer deal, but was immediately loaned back to Lille for the current season.

After his performance against Everton in Thursday's Europa League clash, Girard believes he is as good as either of Everton's strike duo.

'In today's game, at least, I saw no difference in quality between Origi and Everton's Eto'o or Lukaku,' Girard told Goal. 'We will go to Everton in two weeks hoping to get a result there.'

Origi, who is considered one of Belgium's brightest young talents, was used as a substitute during the World Cup, but still managed to score twice - more than international team-mate Lukaku or Cameroon captain Eto'o. 

With the success of Origi at Lille, and Mario Balotelli's underwhelming performances since moving from AC Milan, Liverpool supporters may be hoping their club can bring the young forward to Anfield sooner than originally planned.
