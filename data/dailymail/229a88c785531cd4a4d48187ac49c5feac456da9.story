The Chancellor has come under growing pressure from MPs and peers to split up Royal Bank of Scotland.

In an open letter Andrew Tyrie, chair of the influential banking commission, said ‘all the options’ for the state backed lender’s future should be ‘examined as a matter of urgency’.

The Conservative MP also dismissed one of the main reasons given by opponents to the split.

Chancellor Osborne has come under growing pressure from MPs and peers to split up Royal Bank of Scotland

He argued that creating a ‘bad bank’ which would continue to be owned by the state would not inflict more harm on the economy or British taxpayers.

The forthright letter was signed by all ten members of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, including the Archbishop of Canterbury and former chancellor Lord Lawson.

Lawson has led calls to split RBS into a ‘good’ bank to boost lending to the economy and a ‘bad’ bank, which will house all its toxic assets and loans.

The idea is the good bank will also be easier to sell back to the private sector. 

At his annual Mansion House speech in June, Chancellor George Osborne launched into an independent inquiry into the merits of the radical move.

Osborne had previously been vehemently opposed to a break up, arguing it would be too time consuming, expensive and complicated.

But he caved in to pressure when the banking commission, which he set up in the wake of the Libor interest rate rigging scandal, demanded an independent enquiry.

In a letter to the Financial Times, Tyrie ratcheted up the pressure on Osborne for a split and raised concerns that the inquiry is conducted free of political influence. This is being conducted by blue blooded investment bank Rothschild and fund manager BlackRock.

Tyrie said: ‘It is crucial that Rothschild approach this important work with a good deal of independence of mind. No obstacles would be put in the way of a full examination  of all aspects of such as split.’

Dismissing one of the main arguments voiced by opponents of the break up, he said: ‘Taking the ‘bad assets’ into a publicly owned entity at their true value does nothing to alter the underlying position of the economy, the public sector’s net worth, or the future burden of taxation.’

He added: ‘The chancellor’s review also needs to examine whether, over time, the taxpayer may in fact be better off as a result of the split.’

It is thought that Rothschild’s independent inquiry has produced little evidence so far that RBS is being restricted from lending by its toxic assets.

RBS recently posted a profit of £1.4 billion in the first half of the year, rebounding from a £1.7 billion loss in the same period last year.

In doing so it made two consecutive quarters of profit this year for the first time since the financial crisis.

But almost five years on from its  £45.5 billion bail out, taxpayers are still sitting on a £15.6 billion loss as the share price has slumped.

The bank has also had to fend off criticism that it has been starving small businesses of loans and recently launched an independent inquiry to investigate the allegations.

Both Osborne and David Cameron had indicated that they wanted to sell RBS back to the  private sector before the 2015 General Election.

But the Coalition is thought to be increasingly resigned to the fact that this will not happen.

Earlier this month business secretary Vince Cable warned that it is ‘pretty unrealistic’ that taxypayer’s 81pc stake in RBS will be sold off within the next five years.
