A 16-year-old junior at an Ohio High School was arrested Monday for carrying a loaded weapon that he told police he was planning to use to 'open fire' on students, officials said.

Police said that a classmate at Fremont High first noticed the handgun  and contacted authorities, who placed the school on lockdown after confirming the student had a weapon. 

'After interviewing the subject, he admitted to detectives that he brought the gun to school with the intent to shoot a particular student and then open fire on the rest of the school,' Weber County Sheriff's Sgt Lane Findlay told Deseret News.

Lockdown: Good4Utah reports that police placed Fremont High on lockdown after a 16-year-old junior was discovered with a loaded handgun, which he told officers he planned to use to 'open fire' on students

The student reportedly planned to shoot a girl he had a relationship with in the past, and police contacted both the girl and her family to make them aware.

'Obviously they were quite shaken by this,' Findlay said.

Deputies arrived at the school just after 12pm, responding to the classmate's concern about a gun, which the student was reportedly carrying in his waistband.

A school resource officer spoke to the armed student, who was cooperative and confirmed he had a gun, and called for a lockdown. 

'There was a little bit of concern initially if he was just alone and had the gun or if there was possibly another threat,' Findlay said.

Officers conducted a four hour sweep of the school, evacuating classrooms one by one, after the student initially told officers he did not know if there was another person involved.

'They took us out in the hallway, the SWAT team did, and they put us against the wall. They were searching our pants, our legs and everything, making sure we didn't have anything,' said sophomore Mitch Wall.

'You never think, you know in a farm community, this town out here's pretty quiet … that something like this would happen,' said one parent Shelly Beesley.

The student was brought to juvenile detention as police investigate charges of possession of a weapon with intent to assault, possession of a firearm in a restricted area, and possession of a firearm by a minor, all misdemeanors.

The incident comes a little more than a week after the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by a rookie police officer in Cleveland.

Video released by police showed officers driving up next to Rice, who was in possession of an Airsoft pistol with the orange safety cap reportedly removed, and firing two shots at Rice within seconds of arrival.
