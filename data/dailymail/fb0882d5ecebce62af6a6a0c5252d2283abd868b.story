The ‘Butcher of Brooklyn’ accused of killing a boy is a schizophrenic whose horrific actions were in part down to inbreeding, his lawyers claim.

Levi Aron, 35, of Brooklyn, New York, is accused of kidnapping the eight-year-old Hasidic boy Leiby Kletzky in July before brutally murdering him.

But Aron's defence team claimed he is ‘either evil or crazy’ and said the defendant suffered a severe head injury from a bicycle accident aged 10.

Lawyer Howard Greenberg said: ‘Everybody knows when blood relations have offspring there can be genetic defects', reported the New York Post.

Mr Greenberg spoke after a short hearing in Brooklyn Supreme Court and said there is inbreeding within Aron’s Hasidic Jewish community.

‘That's an aspect of his familial history,’ Mr Greenberg said. ‘He's catatonic,’ he added. ‘There's a history of schizophrenia.’

But Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind told the New York Daily News he was disgusted at how the lawyer handed an ‘insult to the community’.

‘None of this is relevant. It has nothing to do with this situation and is only meant to distract us from the reality of the horrible act,' Mr Hikind said.

Aron, who appeared in court via a video link, was found mentally fit to stand trial. But that is not expected to start until 2013.

It was the first time the little boy was allowed to walk alone, and he was supposed to travel seven blocks to meet his mother but missed a turn.

Aron, a hardware supply store clerk, took the boy home and when they returned, they watched TV before the boy fell asleep, police said.

He remained there the next day when Aron went to work, and the disappearance sparked a major search effort in his insular community.

The boy's picture was plastered on light posts around the area. ‘When I saw the fliers, I was panicky and afraid,’ police say Aron explained.

Aron told detectives his victim put up a struggle and that afterward he was hearing voices telling him ‘to take his own life for what he did’

Aron allegedly carved up the body with knives and disposed of body parts, including severed feet found wrapped in plastic his freezer.

The rest of the boy's body was discovered in bags inside a red suitcase in a trash bin. His legs had been cut from his torso.
