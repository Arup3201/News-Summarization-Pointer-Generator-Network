More than 40 head teachers are earning more than David Cameron (pictured today in Milan)

More than 40 head teachers are earning more than the Prime Minister despite rules intended to curb huge salaries.

The number of state school heads paid more than David Cameron, who earns £142,500 a year, has soared by a third in a year – to 41.

Of those, eight earn at least £170,000 and two take home £190,000 or more.

The revelation prompted calls for greater scrutiny of heads’ pay deals because the system offers ‘significant potential for abuse’.

The School Teachers’ Review Body recommended earlier this year that heads could receive up to £132,685 in exceptional circumstances, rising to £141,250 in inner London.

But the independent STRB also says that normally, the maximum pay for a head in charge of ‘multiple very large schools’ should be £106,148 or £113,000 in central London.

It follows a call in 2010 from then education secretary Michael Gove for heads’ pay packets to be kept smaller than the Prime Minister’s. But he was forced to water down the plan amid warnings a cap would be seen as a target, forcing salaries up instead of down.

The rise in bumper pay packets has been partly fuelled by the growth in academy schools, which are state-funded but enjoy greater freedom over staff pay.

Latest figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, show that 933 heads were paid six-figure salaries last year, almost two-thirds of whom work at academies. This compares with 800 in 2012.

A total of 41 were paid more than £142,000 – up from 31 the previous year.

Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, blamed ‘increased autonomy for schools and weak governance’ for the failure to ensure heads’ salaries are set in an ‘open, fair and transparent manner’.

She added: ‘The opportunity and potential for abuse is significant … the pay system in schools can be summed up as “pay head teachers what they want and teachers what you can get away with”.’

The latest government guidance on setting heads’ pay, published in September, states that the maximum should be £107,210, rising to £114,437 for heads in inner London.

This can be exceeded by 25 per cent where it is considered that ‘circumstances … warrant a higher than normal payment’ and in ‘exceptional circumstances’, a business case could be made to raise a salary even higher.

A spokesman for the National Association of Head Teachers said six-figure salaries were rare, adding: ‘Head teachers perform demanding jobs … their leadership shapes the future for thousands of young people … Yet, despite this, the average head teacher earns nothing like a prime- ministerial salary.’

A Department for Education spokesman said the pay guidance introduced in September was ‘designed to ensure school leaders’ pay is appropriate to the challenge of the post and their contribution to their school or schools’.

Pay rise: Sir Greg Martin, executive head at Durand Academy in Stockwell, received a 56 per cent pay rise

A head earning £229,138 a year is believed to be the highest paid primary school teacher in the country.

Sir Greg Martin, executive head at Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, received a 56 per cent pay rise last year, making his salary more than £200,822.

The rise in 2013 was due to a loophole which means he is running more than one school. He received £28,316 in pension contributions last year. The school said his role was ‘hugely demanding’ and governors were ‘privileged to retain his services’.

But Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said it was ‘remarkably hard to see how this can possibly be justified in a publicly funded school’.

State-run Durand Academy, judged ‘good’ by Ofsted last December, is not under council control and has freedom over areas such as curriculum and staff pay.
