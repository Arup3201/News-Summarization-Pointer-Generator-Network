Men could soon be able to buy an anti-impotence drug over the counter.

Pharmaceutical companies Sanofi and Eli Lilly and Co say they plan to ask health regulators for permission to sell Cialis, the world's top-selling anti-impotence drug, without a prescription.

The drug, which is also used to treat enlarged prostate glands, is currently only available by prescription.

The anti-impotence drug Cialis could become available over the counter in the U.S. and Europe

Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi is buying the exclusive rights to apply for approval of Cialis tablets over the counter in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia.

It is not yet clear whether this could include the UK and when the drug could become available if approved.

It also remains to be seen whether regulators will allow Cialis to be sold without a prescription, in view of possible side effects.

Like rival anti-impotence drugs, such as Pfizer Inc's Viagra, Cialis can cause a dangerous fall in blood pressure if taken with nitrates, a class of heart drugs that include nitroglycerin.

It is also inappropriate for use by people with severe heart disease.

Viagra is not currently available over the counter but can be bought from some specialist pharmacies without a prescription.

It's not clear when the drug could become available and if health regulators will allow it to be sold without a prescription as it is dangerous for people with heart disease and those on some medications (file picture)

However, before it can be purchased, patients have to be asked a series of health questions by the pharmacist to ensure it is appropriate for them to take.

Professor Raj Pesad, a urologist in Bristol, told MailOnline: 'If it happens, there needs to be a measure of safety but I think is entirely feasible for pharmacists to advise because Cialsis is a very safe drug.

‘It's the sort of thing that doesn't necessarily need to be restricted to doctors’ prescribing - but it needs to be given with care to people with heart disease or those taking some heart drugs.

‘The local pharmacist will know what medications people are on from their local GPs so it is a safe system.

‘However, it can have side effects and could make things like heartburn and acid reflux worse.’
