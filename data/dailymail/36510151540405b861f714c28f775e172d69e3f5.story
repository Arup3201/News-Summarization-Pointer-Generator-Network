It would seem that Louis van Gaal wasn't quite prepared for the transfer deadline day departure of Darren Fletcher after almost naming the former Manchester United midfielder as a substitute for the FA Cup replay against Cambridge United. 

Van Gaal, who is rarely seen without his notepad on the Old Trafford touchline, held a printout which featured Fletcher's name crossed out with marker pen and replaced by Ashley Young.

Fletcher, who turned 31 on Sunday, has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with West Brom and has an option to extend that deal by another 12 months.

Louis van Gaal's teamsheet originally included Darren Fletcher, who signed for West Brom on Monday

The Baggies made a deal for the former United vice-captain  Fletcher, who ended his 20-year association with the Old Trafford club late on Monday night.

United also managed to offload Wilfried Zaha to Crystal Palace on a permanent basis while Mernick Vermijl joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan until the end of the season and Jesse Lingard was loaned to Derby.

The only incoming at Old Trafford was a surprise one - that of 21-year-old Bolton defender Andy Kellett, who joins United on loan until the end of the season.

As part of the deal, 21-year-old Saidy Janko moved to the Trotters on loan for four months.
