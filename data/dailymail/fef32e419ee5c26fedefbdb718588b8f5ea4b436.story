More than half a million pounds in allegedly laundered cash has been found in the home of the French comic at the centre of the Nicolas Anelka anti-Semitism scandal.

It comes as Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 47, prepares to travel to the UK so that he can support the West Bromwich Albion footballer.

Anelka faces a five match ban for performing Dieudonne’s ‘quenelle’ gesture – a hand and arm movement which some say is a reverse Nazi salute.

Now police have revealed that a total of £660,000 in cash was found in Dieudonne’s house near Paris, and in the theatre he runs in the French capital.

Dieudonne has been convicted six times for defamation, and is suspected of hiding his money   to avoid paying his fines.

Official searches on Tuesday were sanctioned by a French magistrate investigating money laundering and false tax declarations.

Investigators also believe that Dieudonne has sent the equivalent of more than £380,000 in cash to Cameroon, where his extended family live, since 2009

Investigators also believe that Dieudonne has sent the equivalent of more than £380,000 in cash to Cameroon, where his extended family live, since 2009.

And they allege that a production company owned by his wife, Noemie Montagne, bought one of his properties for £450,000 in cash, when he owed the government £740,000.

But Diedonne’s lawyer, Jacques Verdier, said the French were involved in an ‘organised hunt for Dieudonne’.

Mr Verdier said his client was by  no means anti-Semitic and ‘does not support the Third Reich.’

Anelka has been charged by the Football Association with making a gesture which is considered abusive or indecent – an offence which carries a minimum five-game ban.

Last week, Anelka denied the charge and requested a personal hearing to defend his case.

Dieudonne’s last visit to Britain was in 2010, when he appeared in front of a large of audience of mainly French expatriates at a London theatre.

He argues that his act is full of risque humour about a range of minority groups, including black people and Muslims.

Dieudonne, who was brought up as a Christian, said that one of the reasons Anelka is being made a scapegoat in Britain is because he is a black Muslim who drives a Ferrari.
