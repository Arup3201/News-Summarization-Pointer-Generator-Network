The son of Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has been caught posting racist and homophobic statements on Twitter.

Tanner Flake, 15, wrote comments including 'f****t' and 'n****r,' to his followers on the social networking site.

He has now locked his Twitter account, but screen grabs of the tweets  January and February show the Republican’s son repeatedly using the slurs.

Tanner threatened the 'f****t' who stole his bike, saying  'I will find you, and … will beat the crap out of you.

He also posted screenshots of scores from games on Fun Run, a social gaming app.

The screenshots show that Flake goes by the name of 'n****rkiller.' 

Antisemitic language also featured on the teenager's page - he made a comment about an acquaintance stealing jokes because he is Jewish.

The Flake family have been quick to backtrack on Tanner's comments:

'I’m very disappointed in my teenage son’s words, and I sincerely apologize for the insensitivity. This language is unacceptable, anywhere.

'Needless to say, I’ve already spoken with him about this, he has apologized, and I apologize as well,' Sen. Flake said in a statement to BuzzFeed.

Sen. Flake were only in the press last week presenting a wholesome family image following a trip  to an isolated, uninhabited tropical island with his two teenage sons. 

Tanner and his younger brother 
Dallin, 13, traveled 5,200 miles from Phoenix, Arizona to Biggarenn, in 
the North Pacific Ocean, without any food or water.

Part of the Marshall Islands, the beach 
front destination offered no amenities, forcing the Flakes to catch and 
cook their own food, purify their water, and swim with the sharks to 
procure their meals.

The extraordinary nature of the trip 
aside, Flake told interviewers that his favorite part of the vacation 
was just to spend some alone time with his sons.

'I
tell ya, for a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no 
television, no distractions, no texting. Just talking,' he told The 
Post.

Flake told The Washington Post that one of the most memorable moments of the trip was when he and Tanner were pursed by sharks, who they had to race back to the shore, after spearing a fish in the ocean.
