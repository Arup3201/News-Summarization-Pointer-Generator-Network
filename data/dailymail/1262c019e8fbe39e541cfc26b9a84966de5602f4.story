Vice President Joe Biden just can't catch a break this week, coming under fire on Wednesday for calling an Asian politician 'the wisest man in the Orient' just hours after apologizing for using an anti-Semitic slur in a speech the previous day. 

Biden was speaking at the kickoff of the Nuns on the bus tour in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday when he made his second racially insensitive comment of the week. 

While telling a story about Singapore's first prime minister, Biden said, 'You know on the way back from Mumbai ... I stopped in Singapore to meet with a guy named Lee Kuan Yew who most foreign policy experts around the world say is the wisest man in the Orient.'

The terms 'orient' and 'oriental' are generally appropriate for describing inanimate objects but not people.

Biden's inappropriate comment on Wednesday followed a written statement released earlier in the from the Vice President denouncing the word 'Sholock.'

The gaffe-prone VP had used it to describe predatory bankers who loan money to U.S. troops in a speech the day before.

The term, which derives from the name of a vicious money-lending character in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice', is considered anti-Semitic, and Biden had been criticized on Tuesday by the National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, for using it.

Foxman said Biden's actions were shameful and he 'should have been more careful.'

'When someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden, uses the term "Shylocked" to describe unscrupulous moneylenders dealing with service men and women, we see once again how deeply embedded this stereotype about Jews is in society,' Foxman said.

In a statement provided to Business Insider on Wednesday, Biden described Foxman as a longtime 'friend and advisor' and said he agreed with his assessment.

'He’s correct, it was a poor choice of words, particularly as he said coming from "someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden."

'He’s right,' Biden added.

Biden had been praising the Legal Services Corporation during a Washington speech marking it's 40th anniversary when he made the offending remark.

Recounting how people would speak to his son, Beau, about financial and legal difficulties when he was serving in Iraq, Biden said: 'People would come to him and talk about what was happening to them at home in terms of foreclosures, in terms of bad loans that were being... I mean these Shylocks who took advantage of these women and men while overseas.'

The Vice President is known for making race-related slip-ups, having described Barack Obama in 2007 as 'the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,''

Talking about his home state of Delaware in 2006, he said: 'You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.'
