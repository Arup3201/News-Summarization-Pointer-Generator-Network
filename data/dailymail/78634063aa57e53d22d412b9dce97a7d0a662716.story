Not many university lessons can claim to be as exciting as the one that took place at UCL last night.

In a 10-minute telescope workshop, undergraduates spotted one of the nearest supernovas to Earth to be seen in recent decades.  

The fluke discovery took the form of a bright light in Messier 82 (M82) - also known as the Cigar Galaxy -  about 12 million light years away.

Students and staff at UCL¿s teaching observatory, the University of London Observatory, have spotted one of the closest supernova to Earth in recent decades. The supernova in M82 is shown in the bottom image next to the white markers

Positioned between the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper, the supernova can be spotted with anyone with binoculars in the Northern Hemisphere over the next few days.

The find has been described as a ‘Holy Grail’ for scientists and could help them unlock secrets about dark matter and how galaxies form.

‘One minute we’re eating pizza then five minutes later we’ve helped to discover a supernova,’ said student Tom Wright.

‘I couldn’t believe it. It reminds me why I got interested in astronomy in the first place.’

Messier 82 (also known as NGC 3034, Cigar Galaxy or M82) is the  nearby starburst galaxy about 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major.This composite image of the nearby M82 shows Chandra X-ray Observatory data of starbursts in blue

A supernova happens where there is a change in the core, or centre, of a star. A change can occur in two different ways.

The first type of supernova happens in binary star systems. Binary stars are two stars that orbit the same point.

One of the stars, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, steals matter from its companion star. Eventually, the white dwarf accumulates too much matter. Having too much matter causes the star to explode.

The second type of supernova occurs at the end of a single star’s lifetime. As the star runs out of nuclear fuel, some of its mass flows into its core.

Eventually, the core is so heavy that it cannot withstand its own gravitational force. The core collapses, which results in the giant explosion of a supernova.

At 7.20PM last night Dr Steve Fossey, who was leading the workshop, spotted the exploding star in M82.

‘The weather was closing in, with increasing cloud,’ Dr Fossey said, ‘So instead of the planned practical astronomy class, I gave the students an introductory demonstration of how to use the CCD camera on one of the observatory’s automated 0.35–metre telescopes.’

The students chose M82, a bright and photogenic galaxy as their target, as it was in one of the shrinking patches of clear sky.

While adjusting the telescope’s position, Dr Fossey noticed a ‘star’ overlaid on the galaxy which he did not recognise from previous observations.

The group inspected online archive images of the galaxy, and it became apparent that there was indeed a new star-like object in M82.

With clouds closing in, time was running out, so the team switched to taking a rapid series of one and two minute exposures through different coloured filters.

This helped them check that the object persisted, and they were able to measure its brightness and colour.

Meanwhile, the team at UCL started up a second telescope to obtain a second source of data. By about 7:40 PM GMT, the cloud cover was almost complete, but it was just possible to make out the new object in the second data set.

The supernova is one of the nearest to be observed in recent decades. The closest by far since the invention of the telescope was Supernova 1987A in February 1987, located at a distance of 168 000 light years.

This discovery is more distant at around 12 million light years, about the same as the 1993 discovery of a supernova in nearby Messier 81.

‘The chances of finding anything new in the sky is astronomical but this was particularly astounding as it was one of the first images we had taken on this telescope,’ said student Ben Cooke.

‘My career plan had been to continue my studies in astrophysics. Its going to be hard to ever top this though.'
