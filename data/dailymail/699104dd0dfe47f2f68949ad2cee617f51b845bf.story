Women who have IVF babies using donor
 eggs could be much more at risk for a common but potentially dangerous 
complication of pregnancy, warn researchers.

A new study shows a threefold higher risk of hypertension – high blood pressure – and an even higher risk of pre-eclampsia.

Pre-eclampsia
 is a severe disorder of high blood pressure in pregnancy that is 
potentially fatal for the mother and baby and the only cure is to 
deliver the baby surgically.

The
 use of donor eggs in IVF (in vitro fertilisation) is increasingly 
common among older women trying for a baby who have no eggs of their 
own.

Older women who become pregnant using donated eggs (frozen eggs are pictured) have an increased risk of suffering potentially fatal complications when giving birth, new research warns. An increasing number of older women are now having to rely on donor eggs to have children

But French 
researchers say the pregnancies of egg donation patients are at a higher
 risk of disorders caused by high blood pressure, than the pregnancies 
of IVF patients using their own eggs.

They
 found almost one in five pregnant women using a donated egg developed 
hypertension, compared with one in 20 women using their own eggs during 
IVF.

Altogether 11 per
 cent of women using donor eggs suffered pre-eclampsia, compared with 
less than three per cent of women using their own eggs.

The
 study carried out by Dr Helene Letur, from the Institut Mutualiste 
Montsouris in Paris, involved 580 pregnancies, including 217 from egg 
donation and 363 where women used their own eggs.

Dr
 Letur said other studies had made similar findings, but they were small
 and not strictly controlled for factors that might give a false result.

In contrast, the latest study had a large sample and careful comparison with women using their own eggs during IVF.

She
 said ‘We would have to conclude from the results that egg donation 
itself is a risk factor for pregnancy-induced hypertension and 
pre-eclampsia.

Compared to women who have IVF with their own eggs, women with donor eggs also have a greater risk of getting pre-eclampsia and a threefold increase in the chances of having high blood pressure (illustrated with a stock image)

Pre-eclampsia is a condition that affects some pregnant women, usually during the second half of pregnancy or soon after their baby is delivered.

Early signs include high blood pressure (hypertension) and protein in urine.

Some women suffer severe headaches, vision problems and pain just below the ribs.

The condition can lead to serious complications for mother and baby if it is not monitored and treated.

There is a risk that a mother can develop fits - but these are rare.

Pre-eclampsia affects up to five per cent of pregnancies and severe cases develop in up to two per cent of pregnancies.

The exact cause of the condition is unknown but it is thought to occur when there is a problem with the placenta.

The condition kills around six women every year in the UK and almost 1,000 babies each year, mostly because of complications in early deliver, such as severe breathing difficulties.

‘This has growing importance because of the increasing number of egg donations.’

Experts
 say it is likely to be caused by the body’s response to cells it doesn’
 t recognise, with donor eggs being treated as ‘foreign’ and triggering 
an immune reaction.

The
 results of the study were reported today at the Annual Meeting of
 the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in 
Munich.

In the US, egg 
donation now accounts for around 12 per cent of all fertility treatments
 and around four per cent in some European countries.

The
 extent of use of donor eggs in the UK is not known, although egg 
sharing, where fertility clinics waive or reduce the fee to women who 
allow some of their eggs to be offered to strangers, accounts for 3.5 
per cent of treatments.

Egg
 donation is a highly successful treatment because it uses eggs from 
younger women, which are less likely to carry defects and more likely to
 lead to pregnancy and birth than eggs from older women.

The
 French study found a threefold higher rate of hypertension in patients 
using donor eggs of 18 per cent, up from five per cent among women using
 their own eggs.

There 
was an even higher risk of pre-eclampsia, rising from 2.8 per cent in 
women with their own eggs to 11.2 per cent in women using donor eggs.

Dr
 Letur said it was a high rate of hypertension affecting women using 
donor eggs that patients and obstetricians must be aware of.

She
 said ‘Preventive measures and care are necessary, with screening for 
risk factors for hypertension such as obesity and diabetes and early 
treatment.’

In some cases,
 women at high risk could be prescribed low-dose aspirin from the 12th 
week of pregnancy which has been shown to help reduce the chances of 
pre-eclampsia.

‘For the future, might we match donors and recipients based on genetic factors’ she added.

Women who use donor eggs during IVF, rather than their own, have a greater risk of getting pre-eclampsia, they claim

The researchers found women who get pregnant using donated eggs are three times more likely to have high blood pressure

Findings have important implications because an increasing number of women now rely on egg donors to have children later in life
