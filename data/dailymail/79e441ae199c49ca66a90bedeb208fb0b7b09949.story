Gordon Ramsay arriving at the High Court today with his wife Tana. He told the court he felt like a 'performing monkey' while building his restaurant empire

Gordon Ramsay felt like a 'performing monkey' building his restaurant empire while his father-in-law had a 'cushy number in the office', the High Court has heard.

Mr Ramsay was today giving evidence  as he tried to avoid being held personally liable for the annual rent on a London pub he bought when Christopher Hutcheson, the father of his wife Tana, was at the helm of his business.

The celebrity chef has accused Mr Hutcheson of using a ghost writer machine, more commonly used by authors to sign books and photographs automatically, to forge his signature on a document which made him the personal guarantor for the costly £640,000 annual rent of the exclusive York & Albany pub near Regent's Park.

Film director Gary Love, who owns the York & Albany, has previously described Ramsay's allegation as an 'absurd' attempt to wriggle out of his rental commitments.

In the second week of the hearing, Mr Ramsay was today asked in cross-examination about emails in which he expressed his unhappiness about what was happening while Mr Hutcheson was managing his business.

In court Romie Taylor QC, appearing for Mr Love, told Mr Ramsay: 'You were complaining about him. You thought of him as treating you like a performing donkey - making you overwork away from the office while he was up to no good in the office.'

After listening and agreeing, the chef added that he in fact had felt like a 'performing monkey.'

The judge, Mr Justice Morgan, then turned to Mr Ramsay and said: 'You were doing the donkey work. 

'You were out there working day in, day out while (Mr Hutcheson) had a cushy number at the office where he was able to abstract personal funds for personal gain.

Mr Ramsay has accused his father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson, pictured, of using a ghost writer machine to forge his signature on documents that made the chef the personal guarantor for the pub's rent 

'I am not saying this is true, but this is what you are saying.'

Mr Ramsay agreed with the judge saying the more he had dug into what had happened following Mr Hutcheson's sacking 'the worst it got'.

The chef also faced accusations from Mr Tager that he was aware that a ghost writer capable of reproducing his signature had been used to sign documents including the York & Albany rental guarantee.

Mr Tager suggested: 'You knew all along about this practice.'

But Mr Ramsay told the judge: 'That is not true, my lord.'

Mr Ramsay, who owns 28 restaurants and a cookery school, first gave evidence last week and described 'his shock and horror' at discovering Mr Hutcheson, whom he deeply trusted, had defrauded him and the Ramsay group of companies out 'of hundreds of thousands of pounds'.

The chef is asking the judge to grant a declaration that the rental guarantee is not binding because his signature was used without his knowledge and authorisation when the 25-year lease was signed in 2007.

Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH) won a bidding war seven years ago to secure the 160-year-old building in the exclusive area of north London.

It has since been turned into an upmarket restaurant, bar and hotel, with rooms starting at £150.

Mr Hutcheson acted as business manager for the Ramsay group of companies until the chef sacked both him and wife Tana's brother, Adam, on the grounds of 'gross misconduct' in 2010.

In 2012 their dispute was settled, with Mr Ramsay's wife thought to have severed all ties with her family.

The case at the High Court continues.
