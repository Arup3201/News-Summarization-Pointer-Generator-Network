This is the dramatic moment that a 15-year-old girl feared she would die after being sucked waist-deep into the mud during a stroll with friends.

GCSE student Sophie, from Stretford, Greater Manchester, who has asked us not to use her surname, spent more than an hour trapped in Urmston Meadows in Manchester after veering from stable ground while out for a walk.

She and her friends first laughed off the experience but soon panicked when they couldn't pull her out of the cold ground - and the teenager began to fear for her life.

Trapped: Sophie was sucked waist-deep into the mud after veering off solid ground while out for a stroll with friends on Urmston Meadows, Manchester. Without anything to hold on to, the teenager sunk into the ground

She said: 'I was terrified, thought I’d never get out. At first my friends were laughing, but after an hour I still couldn’t get out so they decided to call the fire brigade.

'I thought they might send three firemen, but about 20 people turned up, fire engine, paramedics. the police... It’s not what I expected.'

Sophie walked on the ground, which looked solid but she was quickly sucked below in to her waist with nothing to hold on to. The mud was so thick that her friends were unable to help her out.

Sophie, who wanted to send a warning out to other walkers, has heaped praise on the rescuers who saved her on Sunday.

She said: 'I would just say to people to check the ground before you walk on it, because it might look safer than it is.

'I don’t want to stop people going up there at all, it’s a beautiful place, but just be a bit careful.

Warning: Sophie has told other walkers to pay extra attention to where they are walking, saying that the ground might look more stable than it is. Sophie was rescued by 20 firefighters an hour after she became stuck

'I was lucky my friends had their phones with them, but I have seen people on their own. If you don’t have a phone to call for help you’d be in trouble.

'I’d like to thank all the firemen and the paramedics and the policewoman who drove me home afterwards.'

Stretford fire crew manager Dave Price, who helped in the rescue, said: 'Where this incident was, the water rises rapidly - we have seen it at 20ft.

Hidden dangers: Urmston Meadows in Manchester, where Sophie was sucked into the mud. A firefighter involved in the rescue said that the incident could have been much worse as the water level can rise to 20ft

'We hope speaking to people in the area and prominently displaying warning posters, more people will be aware of the hidden dangers and that we can prevent any further incidents like we had on Sunday.

'We managed to get the girl out quickly, but she was up to her waist in mud and the water was very cold, so it could have been a far more serious outcome.'

Sophie’s mum praised the firefighters, adding: 'Nothing like this has ever happened, it was horrifying.'
