Three days out from standing trial for the murder of his wife, a California man accepted a last-minute plea deal for a lesser charge on Friday in realtion to the 2012 overdose death of Beth Risenburg - much to the horror of the victim's family.

Jason Risenburg, 38, was charged with giving his 31-year-old wife a lethal dose of the drug methadone on April 2, 2012.

The narcotic is usually used to wane addicts off heroin, however Risenburg had been prescribed it as pain relief for a work-related back injury.

The Fremont man originally pleaded not guilty to charges of first degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and corrupting another with drugs and, if convicted, faced at least 33 years in prison.

Nearly two years after his wife 'unexpectedly died in her sleep', Jason Risenburg (pictured) admitted in court on Friday that he gave her a lethal dose of the drug methadone, which he took to relieve back pain

Victim: Beth Risenburg, 31, died in her sleep on April 2, 2012. Her death was initially not deemed suspicious because he had suffered a string of health problems, however an autopsy eventually proved she had toxic levels of methadone in her system

However with the murder trial set to start Monday, Risenburg pleaded guilty to one charge of involuntary manslaughter on Friday, as part of a deal that the prosecution would drop the murder and drug charges.

Risenburg now faces up to 11 years in prison, with sentencing expected in two to three weeks.

The victim’s mother, Maureen Spaulding, of Northwood, said she reluctantly consented to the plea agreement on Friday just hours after learning her husband, James, is again suffering from cancer.

'Our hearts wanted to go to trial,' she told The Toledo Blade.

'Our hearts wanted him to get the maximum time for what he did.

'I have a hard time accepting getting 11 years for taking her life.

'I can’t see that as fair. I can’t see that as OK, but at the same time the part of me that knows my daughter knows she would want me focused on her Dad’s health right now. I’m choosing to think it was her influence that made it go this way to make us focus on him. She was always daddy’s little girl.'

Three weeks before her death in 2012, Beth Risenburg was taken to a local hospital and found to have methadone in her system.

'He claimed it was an accident — that he had mixed up their two medications and accidentally gave her methadone,' Mrs. Spaulding said.

Methadone - which is available as a prescription under numerous different names, such as Subutex - is typically used to wane people off heroin. However Jason Risenburg said he had been given it by a doctor to treat back pain following a work injury

'She had a horrible reaction to it.'

The incident didn’t sit right with the Spauldings, but their daughter 'loved him to death and wanted to believe with all her heart' that it had been an accident', her mother said.

The two had married in 1999 when Ms. Risenburg was just 18.

'Something had changed in him in the last year. We all saw it. We all knew it,' Mrs. Spaulding said.

'It was hard for Beth to accept, and I think she had finally come to the conclusion that maybe it wasn’t an accident.'

The day Ms. Risenburg died, Risenburg called 911 to say his wife wouldn’t wake up.

She had a history of health problems, so her death was not immediately suspicious to police and emergency responders.

'I knew what it was immediately,' Mrs Spaulding said.

Several weeks after Ms. Risenburg died, the Spauldings took their suspicions to Fremont Police Detective Jason Kiddey, who agreed to look into the claims.

'The family was upset, and my goal was to help them find closure,' Detective Kiddey told The Blade.

'That’s what I truly meant to do, but I didn’t know what I was going to find.'

Not long after he began investigating, toxicology tests performed during the autopsy revealed startling levels of methadone in Ms. Risenburg's system.

The investigation was bolstered, Detective Kiddey said, by a 5½-hour interview he conducted with Risenburg, who moved to North Carolina after his wife’s death but agreed to meet with him during a visit to Ohio.

'It was a gamble - Everything on my case hinged on that interview,' Detective Kiddey said.

While declining to be specific, Detective Kiddey said Risenburg 'confessed to several different things' during the lengthy interview.

Ultimately, Sandusky County Coroner Dr. John Wukie ruled Ms. Risenburg’s death a homicide, and a Sandusky County grand jury indicted Risenburg on the three charges last January.

Risenburg has been held in the Sandusky County jail on $1 million bond since he was extradited here from North Carolina last year.

'It’s very difficult because I see the son [in law] I loved for 15 years, but I also see the man who murdered my daughter,' Mrs. Spaulding said.

'It’s incomprehensible. I’m stunned. I’m still stunned.'
