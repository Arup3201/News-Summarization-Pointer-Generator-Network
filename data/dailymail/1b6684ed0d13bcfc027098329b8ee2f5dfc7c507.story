Vice President Joe Biden threatened reporters Saturday with a water gun.

Biden pulled the water pistol on members of the press during the annual media picnic at his official residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.

‘Anybody who writes a bad story about me is dead,’ he said while holding the gun. ‘I just want you to know that, get this straight, we’re not gonna kid around about this.’

Joking around: Vice President Joe Biden threatened White House reporters Saturday with a water gun

Biden cracked a wide grin while the crowd around him roared with laughter.

A platoon of water-gun wielding children then joined him in soaking press corps, according to tweets from a variety of reporters.

‘The Vice President of the US just shot me with a super soaker,’ wrote the Associated Press’ White House reporter Josh Lederman.

Another video by Slate’s Dave Weigel shows the veep and a grandson of his shooting each other with the water guns.

‘I am your grandfather, what are you doing,’ Biden can be heard asking.

The annual event was attended by members of the media, their families, the vice president and his family.

It also featured live music, an inflatable obstacle course and a bungee bounce, according to various other tweets from the event.
