The compound where cult leader Warren Jeffs sexually abused underage girls is to be seized by the state of Texas, a judge ruled on Monday.

The vast Yearning For Zion ranch, owned by the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints, is being seized following an order which claimed the property was used to commit crimes.

Leader of the ranch Jeffs is serving a life sentence for the sexual abuse of two girls aged 12 and 15, who he claimed were his 'spiritual brides'.

During his trial, it was revealed that the cult leader had fathered a child with one victim. Images were also show of the custom-made bed he had built in which to assault the girls.

Jeffs and 11 other members of his cult were jailed following a 2008 raid on Yearning for Zion which found that multiple underage marriages had taken place, often between girls who had just reached puberty and elderly men.

The order to seize the ranch came from Judge Barbara Walther, approved by the Attorney General's office in Texas.

No one from the FLDS has come forward to contest the seizure, according to Fox 13.

The FLDS Church and the ranchâ€™s owner, the United Order of Texas Trust, can appeal the judge's order in the next 30 days.

In April, it was reported that several thousand people are still living at YFZ and receiving instructions from 'prophet' Jeffs, issued from his  prison cell. 

The Yearning for Zion Ranch is spread 
over 1,700 acres and was home to around 700 FLDS followers on the 
outskirts of Eldorado, Texas.

It became the secretive community of Jeffs' followers who left other religious communities in Utah and Arizona.

In 2008, authorities raided the sprawling estate after receiving calls from terrified children who said they had been abused.

The move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in U.S. history.

During Jeffs' trial, jurors wept as they heard a graphic tape of the twisted sexual instructions he gave his reportedly 80 wives - some of whom were just children.

He warned God would reject them if they did not to submit to his instructions and DNA evidence presented during the trial proved he had fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl.

'If the world knew what I was doing, they would hang me from the highest tree,' Jeffs wrote in a chilling journal entry from 2005 - one of thousands of pages of notes seized by authorities.

Jeffs was given life behind bars for one count of aggravated sexual assault and an extra 20 years, to be served consecutively, for the second count of sexual assault - the maximum allowed for each count.
