Holidaymakers no longer have to worry about leaving expensive items on the beach when swimming, thanks to the latest creation by an American designer.

Tom Turner, from Salt Lake City, has created an innovative pair of swimming shorts that offer a solution to the issue of leaving expensive items unattended.

Styled to look like regular shorts, the trunks include a waterproof pocket that allows swimmers to safely store a phone, wallet and other valuables.

By simply putting the items in the 8cm pocket and turning a secure lock, the valuables can be kept waterproof while the wearer is swimming.

The Stash Pocket is attached into the interior of the shorts by a lock-down fitment, and securely sewn into the material.

Mr Turner, 47, said: ‘My wife and I were getting ready for a trip to the beach.

‘She mentioned that she wished someone made something to keep her phone dry and safe.

‘Every time we went to the beach we had to hide our valuables under a towel while we went into the water, and they could've easily been stolen.

‘I looked everywhere for a solution but couldn't find any product that allowed you to take your phone and wallet with you wherever you wanted to go.

‘So I decided to make my own solution which led me to design the Stash Waterproof Pocket.’

He added: ‘I'm thrilled with the design of the shorts.

‘I'm a big fan of industrial design and The Stash Pocket is truly a blend of form and function which gives any piece of apparel or gear a distinctive look.

‘They easily allow any user to keep their smart phone, keys, and cash safe and dry wherever they go.

‘I like that when people see the 
Stash Shorts, they instantly understand the concept, and say "oh yeah, 
why hasn't someone done this before?"’

Made with a 60/40 polyester and cotton 
blend, the shorts feature double and triple stitch construction, 
multiple pockets and premium-quality zippers.

They cost £52, can be bought from the website Kickstarter, and come in two colours, khaki or olive.

So people don't drop or lose the cap, a durable lanyard string is attached from the cap to the underside of the fitment ring.

Mr Turner said: ‘You can be confident the contents will stay dry.

‘When you twist the cap, not only will you see the lock indicator line up, and lock into place, but you'll also hear and feel the cap lock in.’
