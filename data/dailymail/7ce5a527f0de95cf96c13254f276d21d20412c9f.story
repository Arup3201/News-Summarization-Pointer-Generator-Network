Seven out of eleven of the top judges at the European Court of Human Rights have little or no judicial experience, it has been revealed.

Despite this, they have great power over the UK and in recent times have given prisoners the right to vote and were instrumental in the blocking of the deportation of hate preacher Abu Qatada.

They will now preside over a second case after Qatada lodged another appeal against his deportation to Jordan.

Even the ECHR's president, British lawyer Nicolas Bratza has never actually held a senior judicial position and his experience was limited to a brief stint as a crown court recorder.

Many members of the European Court of Human Rights have little or no judicial experience

Members of the plenary court: 1, Francoise Tulkens; 2, Sir Nicolas Bratza; 3, Ledi Bianku; 4, Jan Sikuta; 5, Danute Jociene; 6, Mihai Poalelungi; 7, Lech Garlicki; 8, Vincente de Gaetano; 9, Anatoly Kovler; 10, David Bjorgvinsson

Last month, he admitted that some of 
the court's best judges - including those on ECHR's plenary court - were
former academics who had been parachuted into the role.

Among
those from the world of academia is Françoise Tulkens, the Belgian 
vice-president of the court. He has no senior judicial experience.

Following Sir Nicolas's rare appearance in parliament Tory Dominic Raab said: ‘The president 
may not be fussed that we have a bunch of academics making the law up as
they go along, but elected law-makers and the public in Britain 
certainly are.’

MPs 
also attacked the extraordinary selection system for the court, which 
allows the 47 member states of the Council of Europe to nominate judges who have never sat in 
judgment in their own countries.

Among
those who have never had experience as a judge include Albanian Ledi 
Bianku, formerly a lawyer and lecturer. He was key the the Abu Qatada 
ruling.

Another is Danute Jociene who has no 
previous experience as a senior judge. At 33 she became the youngest 
judge ever appointed to the court in 2004.

Anatoly Kovler has held no notable posts as a judge and his experience in the judiciary extends only to academic law.

David
Thor Bjorgvinsson is an academic from Iceland who has previously served
relatively minor roles as an assistant judge and judge's assistant.

Danish
national Peer Lorenzen was a former academic before joining the ECHR 
and was legal adviser to Denmark's ministry of justice. He was also a 
judge then president of the Court of Appeal of western Denmark.

Among those with some experience are 
Lech Garlicki, from Poland and ECHR's head of the Human rights section. 
He served as a judge at the Polish constitutional Court for eight years 
after communism fell.

Maltan Vincent de Gaetano was an 
academic before taking up a job as a judge, then deputy attorney-general
and before arriving at ECHR he was chief justice of Malta. Jan Sikuta 
was judge of the Appeal Court of Bratislava 1990 and 1994 before a 
10-year tenure as legal officer at the UN.

Last
month Tory MP Rehman Chishti challenged Sir Nicolas over rulings where 
the court refused to allow the UK to deport terror suspects.

He
added: ‘Can you understand why people in this country get frustrated 
when we have people dangerous to our society that we are not able to 
deport?’

Sir Nicolas 
responded: ‘I can certainly understand it, but our function is to 
determine – and I don’t believe anyone would say we were wrong in doing 
so – whether if somebody is sent back to a country, they faced a 
substantial risk of death or ill treatment... There’s nothing 
exceptional in our court saying there’s a responsibility on the country 
that is returning somebody to these conditions.’

Asked if he agreed the court had gone
beyond its traditional powers by invoking Qatada’s right to a fair 
trial to ‘frustrate’ his deportation, he said: ‘As I was a party to 
that, I don’t think I can accept that.’

In January, Home Secretary Theresa 
May said it was unacceptable Britain could not deport Qatada who ‘poses a
serious risk’ after the ECHR ruled there would be a breach of his right
to a fair trial ‘given the risk of the admission of evidence obtained 
by torture at his retrial’.

Qatada's
lawyers lodged a last ditch appeal in the European Court of Human 
Rights last night in a bid to prevent him from being kicked out of the 
country.

A spokeswoman for 
the court said the deadline for Qatada's appeal was midnight - and it 
was made after 11pm last night. She said: 'It was literally last 
minute.'

As the situation descended into deeper farce, it emerged that the Home Secretary spent last night as a guest of celebrity agent Jonathan Shalit was was celebrating his 50th birthday.

Qatada's legal team claims that judges at the European Court of Human Rights were wrong three months ago when they ruled that he would not be at risk of torture if returned to Jordan, a court spokeswoman said.

The court's Grand Chamber will decide whether to hear his appeal, but the radical cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden's right hand man in Europe, cannot be deported until the court has reached a decision.
