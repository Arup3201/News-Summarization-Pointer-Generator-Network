Lisbon, you have been warned... Madrid is in town. Real and Atletico supporters have arrived in Portugal in numbers ahead of the Champions League final.

Fans have flocked to the capital to witness one of the biggest derbies in history, with so much on the line.

Real Madrid are looking for Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale to fire them to that crucial La Decima, and will be eager to get one over their rivals after losing out in La Liga.

Atletico have shown a fighting spirit all season to get where they are, and a banner on their Vicente Calderon stadium read: 'Play every game like it's your last.'

Diego Simeone has galvanised that fighting spirit into his players, and should be able to count on Diego Costa and Arda Turan at the Estadio de Luz.

After securing their first Spanish title in almost 20 years, Atletico fans took over their city in celebration, and they were displaying their colours again on Saturday morning.

Real fans also joined in with tributes to Lisbon's favourite son Ronaldo, while there were of course selfies on show.

Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos and Ronaldo sent a message to the travelling fans, some of which arrived in Portugal on special 'Real Madrid trains: 'We need your help to bring back the European Cup. Hala Madrid!!'

The game kicks off at 7.45pm on Saturday evening, with plenty of time for the fans to soak up the atmosphere in sunny Lisbon.
