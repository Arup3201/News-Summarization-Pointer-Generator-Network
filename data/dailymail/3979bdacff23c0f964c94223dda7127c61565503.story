David Cameron's bid to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU has been ridiculed by Poland's Foreign Secretary in explosive private recordings leaked to the country's media.

Radek Sikorski, who was in the infamous Bullingdon Club with Boris Johnson at university in Oxford, accused Mr Cameron of 'incompetence' and 'stupidly' pandering to his eurosceptic backbenchers.

He said the Prime Minister had 'f****d up' trying to veto the last European treaty and would fail in his bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with Brussels unless they offer Poland a 'mountain of gold'.

Mr Cameron's plan to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe has been ridiculed by Mr Sikorski in private remarks secretly recorded and leaked to the press

Radek Sikorski should be one of David Cameron's closest allies in Europe.

The Polish Foreign Minister is close to a host of top Tories and has spoken of his admiration for Margaret Thatcher.

After moving to Britain in 1980, he went to Oxford University and became a member of the Bullingdon Club at the same time as Boris Johnson - and just a few years before Mr Cameron.

The 51 year old and his American wife Anne Applebaum, a journalist turned historian, also send their two sons to Eton.

Mr Sikorski is widely admired in Westminster and is being talked up as a possible successor to Baroness Ashton as the EU’s foreign policy chief.  

He was granted political asylum in Britain after Poland's communist leaders launched a crackdown in 1981. The regime imposed martial law and arrested thousands from the opposition.

The future Foreign Minister was even awarded British citizenship in 1987 - but was forced to renounce it in 2006 after becoming Minister of Defence in Poland.

Mr Sikorski has led the Polish Foreign Ministry since 2007 and has built up a reputation as a fierce critic of Russia and has consistently led calls for stronger Nato deterrent against Vladimir Putin.

He lives with his wife on a palatial farm near Bydgoszcz, one of Poland's most important industrial centers. The white mansion has columns at the front entrance and is surrounded by a park.

Among the guests who attended Sikorski's 50th birthday one year ago was the actress Olivia Williams, a former girlfriend who starred in 'Ghostwriter', directed by Roman Polanski.

The bombshell remarks were published in Poland after a series of covert recordings of government ministers were leaked to the magazine Wprost.

The country's former finance minsiter Jacek Rostowski also predicts that Mr Cameron will lose the next election. He added that Poland will tell the UK to 'f**k off' when Mr Cameron demands an end to freedom of movement rules.

In a separate conversation Pawel Gras, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's media spokesperson reveals that Mr Cameron was given a dressing down over attacks on Polish immigrants claiming benefits.

Mr Gras: 'The whole thing was stupid. Donald called him at once to discuss it, he had such a go at him, I mean f*** it’s a shame we didn't record it, he had a such a proper f****** go at him.

The conversations allegedly took place at some point this Spring.

Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said: '[Cameron] thinks he’ll go renegotiate and come back, no Polish government could agree to it. Except in return for a mountain of gold.'

The Foreign Minister Mr Sikorski replied: 'It's either a very badly thought through move, or, not for the first time a kind of incompetence in European affairs. Remember? He f***** up the fiscal pact. He f***** it up. Simple as that.

'He is not interested, he does not get it, he believes in the stupid propaganda, he stupidly tries to play the system... his whole strategy of feeding [his critics] scraps in order to satisfy them is just as I predicted, turning against him.

'He should have said, f*** off, tried to convince people and isolate [the sceptics]. But he ceded the field to those that are now embarrassing him.'

Mr Rostowski then said: 'For the Polish government to agree, someone will have to give us some mountain of gold.

'The Brits won’t give it to us, and the Germans, in order to keep the Brits on board, won’t give it to us either in all likelihood.

'So the answer will be: f*** off... [the impact of a Brexit] will generally be bad for us, because we would like for Great Britain to stay.

'I think it’ll be the case that [Cameron] will lose the elections. Great Britain will leave. Once they do, they’ll keep open borders. Not for [gypsy] beggars…' 

The revelations came after it emerged Mr 
Cameron was facing a double defeat in Brussels over his bid to reform 
the EU, according to leaked EU documents.

The Prime Minister is expected to lose his
 fight to stop the hardline pro EU candidate Jean-Claude Juncker 
becoming the next European Commission president. A vote of EU leaders on 
Friday is expected to rubber stamp his appointment.

But in a second setback, it has emerged today that Mr Cameron's plan for a widespread overhaul of Britain's relationship with Brussels has not been included in a list of the EU's 'priorities' for the next five years.

Mr Cameron has promised an in-out referendum in 2017 after renegotiating the UK's place in Europe.

Key extracts of a conversation between Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski and former finance minister Jacek Rostowski:

Rostowski: [Cameron] thinks he’ll go renegotiate and come back, no Polish  government could agree to it. Except in return for a mountain of gold.

Sikorski: It’s either a very badly thought through move, or, not for the first time a kind of incompetence in European affairs. He f***** up the fiscal pact. He f***** it up. Simple as that. He is not interested, he does not get it, he believes in the stupid propaganda, he stupidly tries to play the system... his whole strategy of feeding [his critics] scraps in order to satisfy them is just as I predicted, turning against him; he should have said, f*** off, tried to convince people and isolate [the sceptics].

Rostowski: For the Polish government to agree, someone will have to give us some mountain of gold. The Brits won’t give it to us, and the Germans, in order to keep the Brits on board, won’t give it to us either. So the answer will be f*** off... [the impact of a  British exit] will generally be bad for us, because we would like for Great Britain to stay. I think it’ll be the case that [Cameron] will lose the elections. Great Britain will leave. Once they do, they’ll keep open borders. Not for [gipsy] beggars…

Sikorski: Just like Norway... Enough of this! They’ve f***** up Eastern Europe and a few other things. [Mimics a Brit] If Europe doesn’t reform, it’ll end badly! Let them worry about their economy. If they don’t reorganise themselves, they’ll have as bad an economy as  Germany. How is that so monstrous?

Jacek Krawiec – head of Polish fuel giant Orlen – in  a conversation with spin doctor Pawel Gras, referred to a chat between Polish PM Donald Tusk and Cameron about benefits:

Krawiec: What the f*** are they on about with these benefits? [Cameron] seems a really sensible bloke ... when I met him in London he talked a lot of sense.

Gras: Thoughtless, probably suggested by [some spin doctor] probably came from some focus group, he didn’t think through the  consequences, the whole thing was stupid, Donald called him at once to discuss it, he had such a go at him, I mean f*** it’s a shame we didn’t record it, he had a such a proper f****** go at him.”

Translation: Open Europe

But the Prime Minister was presented with a confidential blueprint of the EU's plans today with no mention of the planned reforms.

Mr Cameron held a 'full and frank' talks over the appointment of Mr Junker with European Council chief Herman Van Rompuy in Downing Street today.

The Prime Minister spelt out that he is determined to fight 'until the end' against the appointment of Mr Junker.

Mr Cameron made clear that if Mr Juncker's name is tabled on Friday, he will demand a vote on his nomination - an unprecedented move in a process which is normally agreed by consensus.

Mr Juncker, the former Luxembourg Prime Minister, has faced hostile briefing by opponents over his drinking habits

Following their meeting, Mr Cameron wrote on his Twitter feed: 'I had a full and frank discussion with Herman van Rompuy. I told him there must be a vote on Commission president.'

Following the 40-minute meeting Number 10 said Mr Van Rompuy had agreed to work through the practicalities of holding a vote after Mr Cameron made clear that he was not prepared to back down, despite facing almost certain defeat.

With a majority of EU leaders - including Germany's Angela Merkel - throwing their weight behind Mr Juncker's candidacy, the Prime Minister looks certain to be outvoted under the qualified majority system, and is thought unlikely to secure enough support even to form a blocking minority of four or more member states.

This morning Mr Cameron said he will go to Thursday's summit in Brussels 'giving a very clear message that this is a point of principal for Britain and I believe an important point of principal for Europe'.

He said: 'The head of the European Commission should be appointed by the properly elected heads of government and heads of state that sit around the European Council table.

'That is a point of principle for me, that is why it is very important that we have a vote, we have a clear expression about this.'
