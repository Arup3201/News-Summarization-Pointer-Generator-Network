The Pakistani Foreign Affairs ministry has said that allegations of rape and child abduction made against two of its diplomats were made by their wives in a bid to help their asylum applications.

Two unnamed foreign diplomats working at Pakistan's High Commission in Knightsbridge, west London, were respectively accused of rape and child abduction in an annual statement released this week by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The allegations - which the Pakistan 
High Commission has labelled as 'sketchy' - were among 14 'serious 
and significant' offences alleged to have been committed this year by diplomatic staff 
based at embassies in Britain.

Two diplomats based in Pakistan's embassy in London have respectively 
been accused of rape and child abduction, but their home country claims the allegations were made by 
their wives in a bid to stay in the UK

The FCO revealed it had asked Pakistan for the officials' diplomatic immunity - which stops embassy staff being prosecuted by their host nation - to be lifted.

But the Pakistani Foreign Affairs 
ministry has now said that allegations were only made against the diplomats by their spouses when matrimonial relations 'became tense'.

Spokesman
 Tasnim Aslam Khan said that, in the alleged rape case, the woman had made the allegation when she wanted to settle permanently in Britain but her husband refused.

According to the Independent, in a weekly press briefing she said: 'Matrimonial 
relations between the couple became tense as she wanted to settle in the
 UK permanently while her husband was not inclined. On his refusal, she levelled these charges.'

According to Ms Khan, that same woman also alleged her husband had abducted their children.

But Ms Khan said those claims arose when the woman was
unable to look after her older children - due to giving birth to another child prematurely - and they were returned to 
family members without her permission.

Ms Khan claimed a similar set of circumstances for the alleged child abduction case.

She added: 'So, in both cases [the] allegations seem to be motivated by desire to seek asylum.'

In a statement, the High Commission said: 'The cases have their roots in the long standing family disputes where a member of the family had complained against the spouse.

'The High Commission for Pakistan is contesting the veracity of these allegations with the FCO while taking full cognizance of its obligations under the Vienna Convention.'

The allegations emerged after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, pictured, released its annual list of diplomats who had been accused of 'serious and significant' criminal offences

Earlier this week, Foreign Officer minister Mark Simmonds revealed the UK had asked for immunity to be lifted in five of the 14 'serious' cases.

The FCO defines serious 
offences as those which would carry a sentence of more than 12 months if
 a conviction was secured.

Under the Vienna Convention, 
diplomatic staff are expected to obey the laws of their host nation but 
are also granted immunity from prosecution.

This can only be waived by 
their own country.

But if a country refuses to lift that immunity, the host nation cannot stop the accused from leaving.

The FCO did not say whether its requests for immunity to be lifted in the Pakistani cases had been successful.

Other offences in the list include claims of actual
 bodily harm against a Cameroon and a Zambian diplomat and a sexual 
assault alleged against a Zambian diplomat.

There
 were six drink-driving claims made - two against Saudi diplomats and 
one each against officials from Belarus, Macedonia, Kuwait and Zambia.

In at least one of the 14 cases, investigations by Scotland Yard are still ongoing.

In a written statement to MPs, Mark Simmonds said: 'Some 21,500 people are entitled to diplomatic immunity in the United Kingdom and the majority of diplomats abide by UK law.

'The number of alleged serious crimes committed by members of the diplomatic community in the UK is proportionately low.

'Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961, those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. The FCO does not tolerate foreign diplomats breaking the law.

'We take all allegations of illegal activity seriously. When instances of alleged criminal conduct are brought to our attention by the police, we ask the relevant foreign government to waive diplomatic immunity where appropriate.

'For the most serious offences, and when a relevant waiver has not been granted, we seek the immediate withdrawal of the diplomat.'

Amongst the other allegations was one count of driving a vehicle reported as lost or stolen and without insurance, against a Sierra Leone official.

There was also one allegation of driving while under the influence of alcohol and without insurance, against a diplomat from El Salvador as well as one public order offence claimed against a diplomat from Kuwait.
