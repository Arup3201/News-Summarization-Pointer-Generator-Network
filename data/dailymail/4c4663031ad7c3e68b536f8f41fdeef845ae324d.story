A new study has found lifestyle choices can account for as much as 33 per cent of how old a woman looks

Living an unhealthy lifestyle can age a woman’s skin by over ten years, an in-depth international study has revealed.

The
 true damage caused by sun beds, smoking and a lack of fruit and 
moisturisation in accelerating the ageing process emerged following 
research on 585 women in the UK, China and Spain.

The
 study, published yesterday, showed the factors influencing their skin 
were the same even taking into account the backgrounds and skin type of 
the women involved.

It also emerged 'lifestyle choices' often account for as much as 33 per cent of how old a woman looks.

Dr
 Andrew Mayes, who led the study for Simple skincare, said: 'We already 
knew genetics accounted for about 50 per cent of how old people look, 
but we didn’t know how much would be accounted for by their lifestyles.

'Even we were surprised by just how much it was; both in terms of the number of years and the percentage.'

The
 study which was carried out over the last eight years involved women 
aged 45 to 75 in the UK, 30 to 70 in Spain and 25 to 70 in China.

Study sites with controlled laboratory conditions were established in Bedford in the UK, Madrid in Spain and Shanghai in China.

Those
 who took part were asked a string of questions about their lifestyles 
including whether or not they liked to sun tan and if they were smokers 
or non-smokers.

Other 
questions included how often the women moisturised, whether they eat fruit and
 veg, whether they brush their teeth and if they have all their own 
teeth.

The research 
team also took digital images of the women which were then assessed for 
how old they looked to identify their perceived age and whether they 
looked younger or older than their actual age.

Those taking part in the research were also asked whether or not they liked to sun tan and how often they moisturised

The research team, led by Dr Mayes, then compared the perceived ages of those with good versus bad lifestyles.

They concluded the difference was 10.4 years.

Dr
 Mayes added: 'The number of years' difference was most staggering - we 
had just seen some data out of a group of plastic surgeons in the US and
 Canada suggesting that a face and neck lift (together with eyelid and 
forehead modifications) could take an average of about 8.5 years off 
your facial age.

'Then we got our data through demonstrating a saving of over 10 years. It’s fair to say at first we couldn’t quite believe it.

'But
 the evidence was there in front of us - women with a healthy lifestyle 
looked much younger than those with an unhealthy lifestyle.

'Simply
 put; good skin health is about more than fancy creams and lotions - 
it’s about how we live our lives and how we treat our bodies and the 
steps we need to take do not need to be extreme.
