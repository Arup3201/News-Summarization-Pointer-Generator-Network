After its recent time in the spotlight, James Turner Street in Birmingham is not a neighbourhood in need of publicity.

But while everyone may recognise the name thanks to the huge success of Channel 4's Benefits Street series, it has done no favours for auctioneers trying to shift a plot of land there.

The attraction of neighbours such as 'mother of the street' White Dee, confessed benefits cheats Mark Thomas and Becky Howe or shoplifter Danny Smith, appears to have proved limited in shifting the plot, which is due to be sold for £20,000.

Grime location: The £20,000 plot is behind a rusty fence on James Turner Street, Birmingham

Local celebrity: White Dee, one of the stars of notorious Channel 4 series Benefits Street, lives just a few houses from the plot

For sale: The piece of land, behind the gates picture above, currently belongs to Birmingham City Council

Notorious: The goings-on of James Turner Street have been exposed to the world after millions tuned in to Benefits Street

The show sparked anger across the nation with its vivid depiction of life on state handouts.

And, despite White Dee emerging from the chaos with a raft of potentially-lucrative media appearances and offers of work, she is still claiming benefits.

The self-proclaimed 'mother of the street' has appeared on several TV panel shows, and even has a fledgling rap career and plans to tour the world - but is yet to end her dependence on taxpayer money and free rent on James Turner Street.

The nearby piece of land, behind number 74 James Turner Street and protected by a pair of rusty gates, is not suitable for house-building.

Instead, it is being advertised to potential buyers as a place to park cars or otherwise store goods.

Ron Darlington, a partner at surveyors CPBigwood, said: 'If I factored in the impact of the show it would probably be to the detriment of the value, because of the type of publicity the street hashad.'

'The streets around there have never been that great, but they’ve never been that bad either.

'I watched a little bit of the programme but then gave up on it. They picked on a street and hammered and hammered away at it, and I don’t think it did anyone around here any favours.'

Notorious: James Turner Street shot to fame thanks to the series, which focused on the area due to its high proportion of benefits claimants

Storage: It is unlikely that a house could be built on the patch

Adverse publicity: Auctioneers have suggested the recent fame of James Turner Street will not help the sale

Bleak: The patch is currently covered by grass and weeds

Unloved: The plot is strewn with leaves and rubbish

Homes on the street typically sell for around £80,000 - around half the average for houses in Birmingham.

The land, currently owned by Birmingham City Council, is one of 15 lots being offloaded by local authorities at an auction next month.

The street shot to fame earlier this year when Benefits Street was aired, and the conditions on the street were even raised in Parliament.

Early episodes featured residents of the street confessing to cameras that they had fraudulently claimed benefits, and at one point cameras even followed a man around central Birmingham on a shop-lifting spree. Police investigations were launched after the footage was aired.

However Channel 4 also came under fire for allegedly bribing resident with fast food and alcohol.

Fans: Eager tourists have begun making pilgrimages to James Turner Street

Producers were also accused of giving a distorted picture of life on James Turner Street, as residents claimed they were being villified, and that their 'community spirit' had been ignored.

Hundreds of fans of the show even began turning up at the doors of its stars, while local community organisers complained that students in nearby schools were being bullied and harassed because of their association with the street.

The piece of land, one of 124 lots, will be up for sale on May 1 at Villa Park in Birmingham.
