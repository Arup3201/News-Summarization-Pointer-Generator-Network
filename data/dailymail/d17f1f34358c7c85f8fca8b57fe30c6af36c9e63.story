The Office of Naval Research is pulling back the curtain on 'automated swarm' technology that would give artificial intelligence the helm on 'deter, damage or destroy' missions to protect personnel.

The Arlington-based Office of Naval Research debuted the technology in August with demonstrations involving unmanned patrol boats that could autonomously defend and attack targets. 

The exercise demonstrated the escort of a high-value Navy vessel to simulate threats in an environment like the Persian Gulf.

Unmanned: The technology should be rolled out to fleet commanders within a year and also has civilian applications

Up ahead, a manned helicopter crew spots a Navy vessel in the role of a possible enemy boat set to encroach on the ship's path.

Using sensor technology, a group patrol boats then break off in an attacking formation to engage the unidentified intruder, while the remaining assets stay behind to protect the ship. 

In one exercise, the patrol boats encircle the unidentified ship and blare warnings from loudspeakers, which eventually drives the target vessel away. 

If that option hadn't dissuaded the other ship, the boats had .50 caliber machine guns and directed-energy weapons that could remotely fire, though planners say the finger on the trigger is human.

Robert Brizzolara, program manager at the Office of Naval Research, said that the artificial intelligence in the software decides for itself what movements the boat swarm makes.

Once a threat is detected, the boats work together and encircle or block the path of an opposing vessel, detecting both the enemy vessel and other nearby vessels' movements.

Advanced algorithms help the boat plan its route and determine its course of action and speed. 

The 'automated swarm' technology Navy's fleet within a year, according to defense officials.

The Arlington-based Office of Naval Research demonstrated the autonomous swarm boat technology over two weeks in August on the James River near Fort Eustis in Virginia

The new technology could one day help stop attacks such as the deadly bombing of the USS Cole off Yemen in 2000 when a small boat packed with explosives killed 17 sailors and injured 39 on the warship

Personnel safety and cost reduction are both driving the development of artificial intelligence-equipped vessels.

According to Rear Adm Matthew Klunder, chief of naval research, self-guided force protection systems would have stopped the terrorist attack on the destroy USS Cole in 2000.  

In the attack, suicide bombers piloted a dinghy with explosives molded to the hull and exploded it near the Cole, killing 17 sailors and injuring dozens more.

In the intervening years, the Navy overhauled how it protected high-value ships, enforcing perimeters and adding defense specialists, but self-guided boats would put personnel out of harms way.

Self-guided unmanned patrol boats that can leave warships they're protecting and swarm and attack potential threats on the water are set to join the Navy's fleet within a year, according to defense officials.

The rigid-hull inflatable patrol boats can also fire .50 caliber machine guns, but a human will always be the one to make the decision to use lethal force, officials said

'I never want to see the USS Cole happen again,' said Klunder, 'I can tell you the systems we just put out on the water would've prevented the Cole.'

The transportable kit that allows a boat to use swarm capabilities costs about $2,000 and can be applied to existing patrol boats and other small vessels in use at Navy bases and aboard warships.

Defense One reports researchers and political experts are raising ethical and legal concerns to giving military assets artificial intelligence.

'Growing autonomy in weapons poses a grave threat to humanitarian and human rights law, as well as international peace and security,' says Matthew Bolton, Dyson College political science professor.

Whereas a soldier can fall back on human discretion in the modern battlefield, 'Death by algorithm represents a violation of a person’s inherent right to life, dignity and due process.'

A similar debate happened over landmines in previous generations, according to Bolton. 

'When the vast majority of countries outlawed anti-personnel landmines,' he says. 'They established that weapons which maim or kill absent of direct human control are morally reprehensible.'

Other researchers say problems will lie with poorly designed systems, not solely its use on the battlefield.

'It will be critical to ensure that these systems behave in alignment with our ethical principles,' says computer scientist Steven Omohundro, who has argued for rethinking how we develop artificial intelligence.

'The security of these systems is also of critical importance because hackers, criminals, or enemies who take control of autonomous attack systems could wreak enormous havoc.'

In 2009, hackers breached electronic defenses of 'two or three' security contractors working on the F-35, according to the Wall Street Journal, which included Northropp Grumman, BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin. 

Officials on the project said a number of fail safes were in place that would shut down the systems if contact between boats and operators were broken.

Klunder says that the technology was originally developed by NASA for the Mars Rover spaceflight programs, but August's demonstration showed numerous boats could coordinate with each other.

'This is something that you might find not only just on our naval vessels, we could certainly see this utilized to protect merchant vessels, to protect ports and harbors, used also to protect offshore oil rigs,' Klunder said.
