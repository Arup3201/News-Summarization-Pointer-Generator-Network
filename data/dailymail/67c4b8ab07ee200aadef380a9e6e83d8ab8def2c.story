Arrested: Jason Lee, 37, was charged with first-degree rape after a 20-year-old woman claimed he assaulted her

A top Goldman Sachs banker has been arrested on charges that he raped a 20-year-old woman at a $33,000-a-month summer house he rented in the Hamptons with his wife.

Jason Lee, 37, was charged with first-degree rape on Wednesday. Police allege that he assaulted the woman during a naked pool party at the home in East Hampton on Long Island, New York.

Lee, the managing director for the Goldman Sachs group that handles the initial public offerings, pleaded not guilty. His lawyer said he is innocent and is looking forward to clearing his name.

He is on leave from his job at Goldman following his arrest.

The East Hampton Star reports that the alleged victim was a guest at Lee's summer house during a party Monday night. 

A police source told the newspaper that there was 'nudity involved' at the pool party.

Sometime that evening or early Tuesday, police allege, Lee raped the young woman.

The party was being held at a four-bedroom mansion Lee and his wife had rented for the summer.

This is the house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred

The New York Times reports that the mansion was listed for $33,000 a month. 

The woman reported the alleged assault to police on Tuesday. Lee was arrested the next day.

During a court hearing in East Hampton Wednesday, which was attended by Lee's wife and several members of his family, Lee posted his $20,000 bail in cash.

An envelope with the money was handed to the clerk of court, who diligently counted out the bills before Lee was allowed to be released.

Lee's lawyer Edward Burke Jr. told the Times that Lee 'adamantly denies the allegations levied against him.' He said Lee has 'never been in trouble in his life.'

'We look forward to clearing his name in a court of law,' Mr Burke said.

Lee is a managing director for Goldman Sachs and works at the investment bank's headquarters at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan. He lives in TriBeCa
