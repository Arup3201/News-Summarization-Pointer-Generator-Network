Top prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC has slammed anti-corruption body ICAC for wanting a 'show trial' to investigate her for claims made in the aftermath of a car crash in May this year involving her son's girlfriend.

Ms Cunneen's legal team, who are in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal today with the NSW deputy chief Crown prosecutor's latest  bid to halt the ICAC probe, say the hearing would be like a 'public flogging'.

Ms Cunneen has taken her case before the state's Chief Justice Tom Bathurst, and justices John Basten and Julie Ward in a bid to reverse a decision last week by a Supreme Court judge.

Justice Clifton Hoeben ruled on November 10 that an ICAC inquiry could proceed against Ms Cunneen, rejecting a bid by her, her son Stephen Wyllie and his girlfriend, Sophia Tilley.

The inquiry sought to investigate an allegation that Ms Cunneen and Mr Wyllie coached Ms Tilley to fake chest pains in order to avoid a breath test following a car crash on May 31.

Ms Cunneen had applied to the NSW Supreme Court to shut down the inquiry, arguing that the Independent Commission Against Corruption had no right to investigate a 'malicious' complaint which related to her private life. 

Ms Tilley was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo when it was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore.

The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped for some time and experienced chest pain, fearing that her breast implants may have been ruptured. She telephoned Mr Wyllie and he and his father attended the scene.

Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident and a blood test conducted afterwards on her at Royal North Shore Hospital showed no alcohol in her system.

However, the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced late last month that it was investigating Ms Cunneen, Ms Tilley and Mr Wyllie over a corruption allegation. 

Daily Mail Australia has revealed that ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30.

In August, Ms Cunneen faced a private hearing over the allegations.

On October 29, Ms Cunneen, her son and Ms Tilley received a summons to attend a public inquiry into the matter, sparking their court bid to halt the proceedings.

Ms Cunneen has argued the ICAC was acting beyond its jurisdiction and there was no suggestion the allegations involved her conduct as a crown prosecutor. Last week, the three launched court action to stop the inquiry.

A public hearing due to start last week was stalled by court action which ended with Justice Hoeben's ruling, which Ms Cunneen is now appealing against.
