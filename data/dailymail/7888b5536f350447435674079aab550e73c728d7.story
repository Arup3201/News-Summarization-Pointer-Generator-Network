Hundreds of emergency workers from more than 30 agencies converged on Los Angeles International Airport on Wednesday morning for a major disaster drill.

LAX Air Exercise 2013 was described by organizers as a ‘full-scale, simulated aircraft disaster drill’ designed to test the airport’s emergency response capabilities during a two-hour, unrehearsed exercise.

The drill is required by the Federal Aviation Administration to be conducted by Los Angeles World Airports at least once every three years to evaluate the operational capability and readiness of LAX’s emergency management system in a ‘real-time, stress-filled environment.’

Local residents were warned before the drill to expect to see some flames and pyrotechnics during the exercise

Over 100 volunteers wore makeup and played the role of accident victims and family members positioned along the airfield ramp area at the southwest edge of LAX. Some role players were evacuated by ambulance and helicopters.

The disaster scene included a Boeing 777-300 aircraft and simulated ‘debris field’ of aircraft parts strewn about the area.

Speaking to KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO prior to the drill, John Kinney, director of Emergency Management Director at LAX, warned nearby residents to expect to see some flames during the exercise, reports CBS.

‘There will be some pyrotechnics associated with this because we’re trying to simulate and create a sense of realism,’ Kinney said.

More than 300 participants representing over 30 organizations took part in the exercise, including Los Angeles Airport Police; Los Angeles Fire Department; Federal Aviation Administration; National Transportation Safety Board; Transportation Security Administration; American Red Cross, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Customs & Border Protection; and the Los Angeles City Emergency Management Department.
