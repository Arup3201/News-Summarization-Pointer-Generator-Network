Sportsmail analyses what we learned from the latest round of fixtures in the Premier League and Football League during the festive period:

1. While virtually every other manager moaned about the Christmas fixture list, Burnley proved it is possible to play two games in 48 hours and not get too tired.

Winger George Boyd had covered more ground than any other Premier League player on Boxing Day when he ran 8.1 miles against Liverpool, and he matched that distance exactly at Manchester City with his energy late in the game a key factor in the comeback from 2-0 down.

But Sean Dyche’s whole team followed those energy levels. An unchanged side ran 74.5 miles collectively at the Etihad Stadium, further than the 74.2 they achieved in the 1-0 defeat by Liverpool.

2. Santi Cazorla has emerged as Arsenal’s penalty expert after slotting away his third spot kick in five matches.

At the age of 30 the Spain midfielder seems to have come to spot-kick duties late in his career.

Until he got the first of this batch – at Stoke – he had never previously scored from the spot for the Gunners in more than two seasons. There are no penalties listed among his goals in Spain for Villarreal and Malaga, either.

3. Wilfried Zaha’s return to Crystal Palace was said to be one of the reasons Tony Pulis fell out with chairman Steve Parish before walking out before the start of the season.

Parish, who wanted Zaha back from Manchester United, got his way by bringing in the 22-year-old on loan after Pulis had left. It hasn’t been a success. Zaha scored on his second debut, but since then has only twice completed 90 minutes.

He was restored to the starting line-up by caretaker Keith Millen for the 0-0 draw at QPR, but was subbed again after little more than an hour having had only one shot at goal.

4. Cesc Fabregas continues to set the standard for creative midfield play.

His delicious pass off the outside of his foot for Eden Hazard to score Chelsea’s goal at Southampton was his 13th assist of the season.

That’s the same number that Steven Gerrard achieved all last season for Liverpool to be the best provider of the 2013-14 campaign.

Cesc Fabregas has already provided 13 assists for his Chelsea team-mates so far this season

5. Mystery continues to surround the games that top referee Mark Clattenburg is given to control. The 39-year-old FIFA official, recently banned as a punishment for driving away from a game at West Brom in his own car because he wanted to dash to see a pop concert, was back at The Hawthorns again for the Boxing Day game with Manchester City.

But on Sunday he was demoted to League Two to take charge of Shrewsbury’s 0-0 draw with Wycombe. Meanwhile Neil Swarbrick, Martin Atkinson, Mike Jones, Roger East and Anthony Taylor all took charge of two Premier League games in 48 hours.

6. Former Barcelona star Bojan has hit all the headlines but it is Steven Nzonzi who is the unsung hero of Stoke’s midfield.

The 26-year-old Frenchman was his side’s top passer in the 2-0 win over West Brom as well as the Boxing Day victory at Everton.

Nzonzi and skipper Ryan Shawcross are the only two players to have been picked by boss Mark Hughes for every minute of every Premier League game.

7. Newcastle will send Cheick Tiote to the Africa Cup of Nations in January with fingers crossed that he comes back without any further injury troubles.

The Ivory Coast midfielder has finally shaken off the hamstring issues which have affected him all season and was a key man in the 3-2 win over Everton.

The 28-year-old made one goal, was involved in the build-up to another and set up three more chances.

8. Andros Townsend has struggled for first team chances under Mauricio Pochettino – the 0-0 draw with Manchester United was only his second Premier League start all season.

The England winger did his best to grab the chance, covering 395 metres at sprinting speed, despite getting taken off 11 minutes from the end the most of any player on display at White Hart Lane.

Sadly there wasn’t enough end product to it. He managed two long range shots which were easily saved, but failed to set up a chance for any of his team mates.

9. Gary Rowett has transformed Birmingham since taking charge at the end of October following the humiliation of an 8-0 home defeat by Bournemouth.

The 3-1 win at Nottingham Forest took the former Burton boss to 20 points from his first ten matches.

Welsh striker David Cotterill has benefited more than most from the added confidence – he’s got four goals in the last six games.

10. For all that players and managers argue about the merits of a winter break, fans love the Christmas programme.

An average of 36,000 went to Premier League games over Boxing Day and Sunday, while the figure was more than 20,000 in the Championship, above 7,000 in League One, and 5,600 in League Two.
