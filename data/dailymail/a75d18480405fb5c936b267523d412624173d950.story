At every Atletico Madrid game this season, Chelsea's scouts have monitored Diego Costa's every move. Where he goes, they go.

From the moment his season began with two goals against Sevilla, the Spain striker has been on the wishlist of Jose Mourinho.

Since then he has gone on to score 35 times for Atletico as they power their way towards the La Liga title and the Champions League final.

Top of the shopping list: Chelsea are desperate to sign Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid this summer

Predator: Costa coolly slotted home a penalty that helped finish off Chelsea in the Champions League

Costa quickly made his way up the list of potential recruits because Chelsea have monitored the progress of keeper Thibaut Courtois since he left for Atletico on loan. Now he is right at the very top of it.

They hope that Costa, who is leaving the Vicente Calderon after the Champions League final on May 24, will lift the curse of the Chelsea striker.

Since Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003, they have been through every striker in every major league across Europe.

Arguably only Didier Drogba, who struck the winning penalty against Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final, is the only real success.

Over the years Abramovich has thrown nearly £200million at the problem.

Shove off: Costa confronted Terry during the first leg at the Vicente Calderon

Adrian Mutu, Hernan Crespo, Mateja Kezman, Drogba, Salomon Kalou, Andriy Shevchenko, Claudio Pizarro, Nicolas Anelka, Franco Di Santo, Daniel Sturridge, Fernando Torres, Romelu Lukaku, Patrick Bamford, Lucas Piazon, Demba Ba and Samuel Eto’o are among the imports.

Among that lot, Drogba is way out in front.

In the history of the Premier League, only three Chelsea players have won the golden boot as the leading goalscorer.

Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink scored 23 times in 2000-01, but the Dutch forward was before Abramovich’s time.

Drogba won it twice (2007 and 2010) and Anelka held off Cristiano Ronaldo to win it in 2009, just four months after his £15m move from Bolton.

It is Abramovich’s dream to bring in a forward that he can drool over when he makes those occasional appearances in his executive box on the halfway line at Stamford Bridge.

Goodness knows, he has tried enough times.

Next season Mourinho, who has complained throughout the season about the quality of his strikeforce, has promised him that Costa will be the answer.

Although his accidentally-on-purpose criticism of his strikers with Canal+ was made public, he had been complaining about his forwards long before that was aired.

It was in the coaches’ room at Norwich, minutes after Chelsea’s 3-1 victory at Carrow Road, when Mourinho complained bitterly to those present about their class.

In games against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Super Cup and Swindon in the Capital One Cup at the County Ground, Torres was the only orthodox striker to score for the club.

Torres, Ba and Eto’o, signed in an emergency on August 29 when Anzhi Makhachkala went into financial meltdown, had yet to get off the mark in the Premier League.

Mourinho wanted to address it and Costa’s arrival, for a fee of £32m, is believed to be the answer. They certainly hope so.

Costa has impressed Chelsea’s scouting department and number crunchers at the club are convinced he will be the answer next season.

Not the player he once was: Fernando Torres has failed to justify his £50m transfer fee

Moved on: Daniel Sturridge is another front man who failed to live up to expectations at Stamford Bridge

His development has been remarkable, returning from a successful loan spell at Rayo Vallecano in 2012 to get his career at Atletico underway.

He is the first of a couple of arrivals that Mourinho is convinced will turn Chelsea into genuine challengers for the Barclays Premier League and Champions League next season.

At 6ft 3in, Costa can look after himself in the heat of battle. This guy is not afraid to tread on a few toes.

In the Calderon, in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, Costa deliberately thrust his chest into John Terry during the opening exchanges.

It was a mild incident, easily missed, but it showed that Costa is not afraid of the physical side of the game.

Next season, when combat starts in the Premier League, those qualities will come in handy.

Big shoes to fill: Didier Drogba is the only striker to have achieved true success in the Abramovich era

Get me a goalscorer! Jose Mourinho has lamented the quality of his strikeforce this season

He is not a technical player and it may take time for him to settle into Spain’s system at the World Cup.

Costa’s debut for Vicente del Bosque’s side, against Italy in the Calderon in February, was uneventful. Some at Chelsea still needed convincing

But Chelsea are not the type of team to have possession for possession’s sake. Under Mourinho, they have a different way of playing.

Next season the team will be set up around Costa, programmed to deliver the ball into the penalty area. From there, he is exceptional.

He shows no fear, instantly grabbing the ball at Stamford Bridge in the Champions League semi-final second leg after substitute Eto’o had tripped him.

From the penalty spot, Costa put Atletico into a 60th minute lead with a drilled effort into the top corner of Mark Schwarzer’s net.

That finished off Chelsea, but even then he knew where he would be playing his football next season.

This time, they hope to strike lucky.
