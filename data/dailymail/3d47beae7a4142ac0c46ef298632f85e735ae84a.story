The parents of a 17-month-old girl who was allegedly killed by her babysitter four years ago have broken their silence to reveal they have forgiven the woman accused of the murder.

In an astonishing show of compassion, Todd and Deniele VanLeeuwen said they even asked prosecutors not to seek a retrial after a jury failed to find Megan Martzen guilty in the death of their daughter Ella.

'We have forgiven [Megan] and we have 
forgiven the Martzens,' Todd VanLeeuwen, of Fresno, California, told KFSN. 'It's just - there's a fracture there and I 
don't know if it will ever heal.'

Martzen, 22, pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to just three years probation this week after her trial ended in a hung jury in February.

Struggle: Todd and Deniele VanLeeuwen have spoken out about the 2009 death of their daughter Ella

She claims that Ella fell from her bed, sustaining injuries that claimed her life three days later, but the VanLeeuwens said doctors convinced them that Martzen was to blame for the death.

Mrs VanLeeuwen told KFSN that she received a frantic call from Martzen, then 19, in February 2009 and raced to her home in Reedley, where she found her daughter in a frightening condition.

'Her body was limp and bruised already and her eyes were rolled back and very, very labored breathing,' she said.

The little girl was rushed to hospital and the VanLeeuwens comforted the babysitter, believing that their daughter had fallen while in her care.

But doctors began telling them otherwise, and they said they were finally convinced when one got to his knees and repeated to them that he believed Martzen was to blame.

'So we didn't believe him,' Todd 
VanLeeuwen said. 'We did the same thing the defense attorney does: We started
coming up with other scenarios and each time, he'd say, "No, I'm 
sorry".'

But this February, all but two jurors believed Martzen was not guilty and the trial ended in a mistrial.

Defense doctors argued that the little girl had suffered a previous fall and had swelling on her brain when she went to Martzen's home.

Even though the family still believe she is responsible, they have decided to move on.

'The prosecutor was dead set on retrying 
this and we went to him and asked him not to because the first trial was
so incredibly hard,' Mr VanLeeuwen said.

His wife added: 'We've just chosen to choose joy because 
there is joy. We still have wonderful memories of Ella. She's not 
hurting, that's the biggest joy.'

They said they are also focusing on bringing up their two surviving children.

Martzen was six months pregnant at her first hearing on charges of murder and assault on a child causing death. She spent 52 days in jail and faced 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

Martzen's son, Maverick, 
was born in 2010. Child Protective Services sought to take custody
of the boy, but then decided to let Scott Martzen, Megan's husband, 
take custody of the child.

Plea deal: Martzen said ahead of her appearance at Fresno County Court that her heart hurts for the family

She is now only allowed to spend 48 hours per week with her son Maverick, who lives with his father.

Speaking outside Fresno County Court ahead of the sentencing, Martzen said: 'I would've never done anything to hurt Ella, I loved her so much. My heart hurts for the family.'

Martzen's family added that they hope that the once-close families will reconcile in the future.

'We know that healing will occur,' her father-in-law John Martzen said.
