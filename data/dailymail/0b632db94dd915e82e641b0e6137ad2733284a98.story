A tiny block of toilets in Barnsley have been sold for nearly £70,000.

The toilets in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, had a guide price of £20,000 but sold for £67,000 - £27,000 more than a two-bed terraced house on the market nearby.

Barnsley Council sold the toilets at an auction in Sheffield on Tuesday, with six keen buyers quickly sending the price soaring. 

The council owned toilet block in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, sold for £67,000 - £47,000 more than the £20,000 guide price - after six bidders quickly sent the price soaring

It is understood that the winning bidder is an entrepreneur form Doncaster.

Local businessman and bar owner Arthur O'Loughlin was interested in the toilets, but pulled out of the auction when the price got too high.

The toilets were closed earlier this year after the council said it was unable to pay for the upkeep.

Auctioneer for Mark Jenkinson and Son, Adrian Little, said: 'I've sold around 10 or 12 toilets in a career of more than 30 years, but these are the ones that have brought in the most.'

The toilet block was bought by a local entrepreneur who is expected to turn it into a business

The toilet block sold for £27,000 more than what this two-bedroom house, some 900 yards away, is going for

Just 900 yards from the toilet block, for £40,000 a prospective buyer could pick up a two-bed terraced home. It only comes with one toilet, but it also has a kitchen, a bathroom, two double bedrooms, gas-fired heating, fitted kitchen units and a front and back garden.

Mr Little said you couldn't compare the toilet block with a residential property, as it offered commercial opportunities.

He said the toilet block was a 'fairly modern' building, was 'right on the shopping parade' and could easily be turned into a cafe or retail outlet.

'It's not a bog standard building,' he joked.

Mr Little said it was too early to say what the new owner would do with the property.

'But they must have a plan that makes it work because it's a lot of money. It will be interesting to see how it works out.'
