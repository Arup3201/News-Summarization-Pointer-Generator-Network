Ancient rock etchings along a dried-up lake bed in Nevada have been confirmed to be the oldest recorded petroglyphs in North America, scientists said.

The petroglyphs, which date back at least 10,000 years, were found on limestone boulders near Pyramid Lake in northern Nevada's high desert.

The carvings are abstract with tightly clustered geometric designs including diamond patterns and short parallel lines on top of a longer line, but no-one knows who carved them.

The etchings are similar in design to some 
found at a lake in Oregon that are believed to be at least 7,600 years 
old.

Later drawings sometimes depict a spear or antelope instead of abstract patterns.

The oldest petroglyphs were found on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe's reservation land.

Eugene Hattori, the curator of 
anthropology at the Nevada State Museum in Carson City who co-authored a
 paper on the findings, said: 'We initially thought people 12,000 or 10,000 years ago were primitive, but their artistic expressions and technological expertise associated with these paints a much different picture.'

His research is published in the Journal of 
Archaeological Science.

Geochemist Larry Benson, who used radiocarbon testing to date the etchings, believes the petroglyphs could be as much as 14,800 years old.

Radiocarbon testing dated the carbonate layer underlying the petroglyphs to roughly 14,800 years ago.

Geochemical data, sediment and rock samples from adjacent Pyramid Lake show they were exposed to air from 13,200 to 14,800 years ago and again from 10,500 to 11,300 years ago. 

'Whether they turn out to be as old as 14,800 years ago or as recent as 10,500 years ago, they are still the oldest petroglyphs that have been dated in North America,' said Benson, a national research scientist emeritus for the U.S. Geological Survey and curator of anthropology at the University of Colorado Natural History Museum in Boulder. 

Dennis Jenkins, an archaeologist with the University of Oregon's Museum of Natural and Cultural History, called it a significant discovery.

He led recent excavations of obsidian spear points near Paisley, Oregon, that he dated back 13,200 years, and noted that the bigger challenge is identifying who created the petroglyphs. 

Nobody knows who created the etchings but some believe they show meteorological patterns, while others simply say they are amazing patterns created by Native Americans thousands of years ago. A Native American dressed in traditional regalia  is pictured

'When you get back into this time period, if you speak with Native Americans they will tell you they were made (created) there and that is obviously their people and their artwork,' Jenkins said.

'But approaching it from a scientific point of view - what we can prove - at this point, it is impossible to connect these to any tribal group.'

William Cannon, a longtime archaeologist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management who discovered the petroglyphs at Long Lake in Oregon, brought the Nevada site to Hattori's attention years ago.

He said they bore similarities to petroglyphs at nearby Winnemucca Lake and Hattori began connecting the dots. 

The etchings in Nevada and Oregon have relatively deep, carved lines dominated by linear, curved and circular geometrical designs.

Researchers have suggested the etchings represent various meteorological symbols, such as clouds and lightning and even perhaps the Milky Way. 

'But we really have nothing to go on for these particular petroglyphs that go back 10,000 or more years,' Hattori said.

One theory suggests the etchings represent meteorological symbols but others think they are old patterns created by Native Americans
