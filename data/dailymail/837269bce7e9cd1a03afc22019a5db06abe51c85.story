Hundreds of University of Texas students donned sombreros, construction gear and camouflage outfits to attend an offensive 'border patrol' party at the Phi Gamma Delta (called Fiji) fraternity Saturday night.

Fiji's president Andrew Campbell jumped to defend the party to student newspaper the Daily Texan, claiming it was actually an Old West-themed event that had simply been misinterpreted.

But pictures taken inside the party, and obtained by the newspaper, tell a very different story.

Revelers: The Phi Gamma Delta chapter at the University of Texas held a party this weekend where patrons dressed up in traditional Mexican clothing including sombreros and ponchos 

Decked out: Fraternity President Andrew Campbell claims the theme was actually Old West, but that description didn't match up to some of the Mexican decorations pictured at the house

The fraternity house was decked out with a temporary tequila bar and a head-in-the-hole picture stand where guests could pose as a Mexican cowboy and his Seniorita. 

Those who attended the event also told the paper that guests wore construction hard hats and reflective gear with name tags like 'Jefe' and 'Pablo Sanchez'.

Others wore camouflage gear as if to represent border patrol agents - a look one wouldn't expect to find on the frontier. 

The house's bar was also painted after the Mexican flag with the outline of the state of Texas in the middle. 

'If any individual or cultural groups were offended, Texas Fiji apologizes for any insensitivity that our guests or members may have portrayed. It is never Texas Fiji's intent to alienate or demean any ethnic group,' Campbell said. 

American fraternities are known for their ruckus parties with questionable themes, but they have come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of several scandals including the rager several University of Michigan fraternities held at two ski resorts last month that caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage.
