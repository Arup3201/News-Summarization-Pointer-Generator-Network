Over-50s’ group Saga is ready for a mass scramble to buy shares in its stock market float, after one in three of its customers said they want to invest.

Saga, which specialises in insurance, holidays and home healthcare, is giving customers and employees priority in the rush to buy stock in a deal set to value the business at £3billion in total.

Investors will also receive one free share for every 20 they buy, so those who buy £1,000 of shares will get £50 worth at no extra cost.

The float could prove even more popular than the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail, after more than 700,000 of Saga’s 2.1million customers, or one in three, expressed an interest in buying shares.

Customers will have to sign up for a minimum £1,000 of stock to be eligible, while 20,000 employees can apply for a minimum of £500.

That suggests Saga could face a clamour for £710million of stock, far out-stripping the £550million that it plans to sell.

If demand exceeds supply, customers and staff will get less than they applied for because a portion of shares will be reserved for ordinary investors and financial institutions in the City of London.

But sources close to the deal said executive chairman Andrew Goodsell was determined that big City firms would not snap up shares at the expense of private individuals.

The Government’s float of the Royal Mail was heavily criticised over the amount of shares earmarked for City firms, which sold them for a quick profit while thousands of small investors missed out.

Saga, which began life as a small hotel in Folkestone, Kent, said ensuring that its customers get shares was part of the company’s ethos. For customers to be eligible for priority status, they have to have bought a product from Saga within a certain timeframe.

‘Our customers are at the heart of our brand and I am delighted that they will have an opportunity to become shareholders in the company and to be part of the next stage of our journey,’ said executive chairman Andrew Goodsell.

Anyone who has bought a financial product, a Saga magazine subscription or a private healthcare between January 5, 2013, and yesterday will be eligible.

Those who booked a Saga or Titan holiday or cruise, including anyone who travelled with them, will be eligible as long as they booked between January 5, 2011, and yesterday.

Saga is being sold by private equity groups CVC, Permira and Charterhouse.

The trio bought Saga for £1.3billion in 2004 and later merged it with the AA breakdown firm in a combined group called Acromas.

Acromas restructured the two companies last year to ensure their finances were entirely separate.Mr Goodsell owns a 7 per cent stake in the Saga, which is set to be worth £154million based on the company’s intention to sell 25 per cent of itself for £550million.

The Saga float marks the next chapter in the 60-year history of a company that began life as a guesthouse for retired holidaymakers in Folkestone.

It has since expanded into areas including insurance, financial services, holidays and home care, all for the over-50s.

It said it would use the £550million it raises to bring its debts down to £700million.

Once the float is complete, it is expected to focus on building its financial services offering, in the light of government changes to the pension industry.

This is expected to lead to a slump in annuity sales, but huge growth in other products that allow pensioners to invest their money in the stock market and elsewhere.

Saga hopes to benefit from this, as well as the ageing demographic of the UK.
