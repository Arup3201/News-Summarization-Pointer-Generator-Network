The Australian Communications minister Malcolm Turnbull has made a lengthy denial after his remark about 'a demented plutocrat' media mogul was interpreted as a reference to News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch.

Turnbull made the controversial comment last Friday night at the launch of the Saturday Paper, a new  venture from the stable of independent publisher, Morry Schwartz, the Guardian Australia reported.

On the stage with Schwartz, also publisher of the Monthly magazine and the Quarterly Essay, Turnbull said Schwartz’s publishing ventures operated at a profit so he was not a 'demented plutocrat' looking to push an agenda.

Speculation ensued as to whether Turnbull was referring to Rupert Murdoch.

On a Sunday morning blogpost, Turnbull said he was surprised people thought he was referring to Murdoch.

'Rupert Murdoch has been publishing newspapers, including today some of the world’s most influential such as the Wall Street Journal, the Times of London and The Australian, for more than 60 years,' Turnbull wrote.

'And they have been and remain profitable. Far from being a rich man like [William Randolph] Hearst and many others who makes his money in some other area and then chooses to start a newspaper to promote his own political views, Rupert Murdoch started off as a newspaper man, the son of a newspaper man, and remains a newspaper man.'

Turnbull said he had referenced the Orson Welles character, Hearst, from Citizen Kane earlier in his speech.

In a copy of the speech – written before Turnbull delivered it, and obtained by the Guardian Australia – the demented plutocrat comment does not appear.

In the speech, he made observations about the state of the media, industry regulation and the potential for profit, saying the launch of The Saturday Paper showed rumours of the death of newspapers appeared to be exaggerated, though the 'rivers of gold' in classified advertising were drying up.

'These days few newsrooms have the luxury of ignoring where their funding comes from,' he said. 'In large part, the industry is yet to settle on a single model, or even strategy, that guarantees viability.

'I have often said that in the digital age, perhaps the scarcest commodity of all is people's attention spans.'

He noted the success of the Daily Mail online, Guardian Australia and Buzzfeed Australia as examples of Australia's media becoming more diverse.

'While media companies jostle and vie in the new environment, the role of governments is pretty simple: to help, not hinder, new business models emerge and make it easier for companies to innovate,' he said.

'Across my portfolio the current media, telecommunications and radio communications regulatory framework is still fundamentally based in a mid-1990s world of relatively stable technologies and business models.'

He said the explosion of the internet, mobile phones and social media. along with the the rollout of a fast broadband network and the rise of cloud computing had changed the media landscape.

'In heavily regulated markets, tight regulation usually helps incumbents – they have armies of lawyers to help navigate complex rules and lobby governments where smaller companies lack the resources,' he said.

'The pressures on the regulatory arrangements and the negative impact of out-dated regulation on the sector will only increase.'
