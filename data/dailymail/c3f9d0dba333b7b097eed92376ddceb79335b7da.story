He was destined for the pot – if they had found one big enough to fit.

But Claude the Tasmanian giant crab was saved from death when the fisherman who caught him sold him to a British aquarium  for £3,000.

Now, after a 29-hour plane journey from Australia – where giant crab meat is a delicacy – and two weeks in quarantine, Claude is ready to meet his public.

Catch of the day: Held up by Sealife aquarist Jemma Battric, Claude weighs a mighty 15lbs and measures 15 inches wide - when he is fully grown he will weigh a whopping 30lbs and gain an extra three inches

Lucky escape: The Tasmanian King Crab is a delicacy in its native Australia and was destined for the dinner table until it was snapped up by a British aquarium worker. He paid £3,000 for three and had them flown to the UK

He is the biggest crab on display in the UK and weighs a mighty 15lb with a 15-inch shell – enough to make 160 crab cakes.

Claude is 100 times bigger than a standard UK shore crab. Yet he is still a juvenile and will grow to double his weight.

Claude was caught off the coast of 
Tasmania last month, but was sold to the Sea Life group along with two 
other Tasmanian giant crabs.

He will go on display at the Sea Life
 centre in Weymouth, Dorset, on Thursday, and his two companions will 
be  moved to other centres in Birmingham and Berlin if Claude responds 
well to his new home.

Currently he is being kept on his own
 in a specially made cylindrical tank, ten feet tall and six feet wide, 
but the aquarium will introduce some coldwater fish once he is settled.

Mini me: Claude dwarfs a British Shore crab who is put on his back for size and to show just how gigantic he is

Big crab, small appetite: 'The crabs don't eat very much despite being one of the largest species and they will feed on shrimp, prawns, and squid when they are here,' said Jemma Battrick, aquarist at Weymouth Sea Life

In the wild, crabs eat any dead or dying matter they find on the seabed 
but Claude is currently dining on diced mackerel and squid and is 
reportedly very happy with his gourmet diet.

Rob Hicks, head marine biologist for 
Sea Life, said: ‘They are such impressive creatures we thought that it 
was worth the cost and effort of flying them halfway round the world so 
they can flourish in an aquarium display.

‘They had a stopover in Hong Kong and
 arrived with us two weeks ago. It took them a few days to get over the 
jet-lag but now they’re feeding happily and don’t seem any the worse for
 their trip.’

Jemma Battrick, aquarist at Weymouth Sea Life said: 'When I found out we were getting the crabs in I was really excited.

Massive claws: Rob Hicks, head marine biologist for Sea Life, said: 'They are such impressive creatures we thought that it was worth the cost and effort of flying them half-way round the world to so they can flourish in an aquarium display'

'We already have a tank here for them so it will be easy to move them in, and they will go on display straight away.

'The crabs don’t eat very much despite being one of the largest species and they will feed on shrimp, prawns, and squid when they are here.

'We want to increase their numbers but in Australia people eat them and I think visitors to the Sea Life will be shocked when they find that out because they look so magnificent.'

Claude weighs a mighty 15lbs and measures 15 inches wide and would have produced 20lbs worth of meat
