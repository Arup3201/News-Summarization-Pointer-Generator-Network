Mother and daughter: Dawn Howie, of Fenham, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 38, gave a kidney to Eryn, two

A mother has saved the life of her two-year-old daughter by giving her a kidney.

Eryn Howie, of Fenham, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was born without functioning kidneys - and her parents thought they would not see her grow up.

But then her mother Dawn was told a transplant was possible - and she was the ideal donor.

The 38-year-old mother-of-four said: ‘Donating a kidney didn't seem like a sacrifice to me - it was just something I needed to do. I feel privileged to be able to give her a new lease of life.’

Both Mrs Howie and her husband Mark, 40, were tested - and she was found to be a match. Mrs Howie and Eryn had surgery at different hospitals, while Mr Howie faced an anxious wait.

At a 30-week scan when Mrs Howie was pregnant, she and Mr Howie, a retail manager at the British Heart Foundation, were told there was only a 50/50 chance their baby would survive.

When Eryn was born in May 2011, Mrs Howie hardly had time to cradle her newborn in her arms before worried doctors whisked her away.

Eryn was immediately taken into Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary's Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Her parents were told she had end-stage kidney failure and that their newborn needed an operation.

At just three days old, baby Eryn was 
taken into surgery as she was too small for regular dialysis - and her 
parents prepared for the worst.

The
 operation was a success, but the catheter they inserted became 
infected, so had to be taken out to let Eryn heal - and they were told 
she might die.

But the family was lucky as hospital had a rare baby dialysis machine from a retired consultant, which saved Eryn's life.

At seven months old Eryn was finally well enough to go home, but still had to go to hospital three times a week for dialysis.

Mr
 and Mrs Howie had to juggle taking their sons Niall, 14, Callum, 12, 
and Kian, eight, to school, with Eryn's five-hour dialysis sessions.

Mrs
 Howie said: ‘A typical day for us was to take the boys to school, go to
 hospital for five hours, then go and pick them up again. The boys have 
been amazing and absolutely dote on her.’

Worry: Her parents were told she had end stage kidney failure and that their newborn needed an operation

First steps: Now Eryn is a happy, healthy two-year-old and should go on to live a normal life

This continued for two years until Eryn was big enough, at 22lbs, for a transplant.

End-stage
 kidney failure, also known as established renal failure (ERF), is a 
very severe stage of chronic kidney disease - when the usual functions 
of the kidney stop working.

The
 kidneys are meant to filter waste products from the blood and then turn
 them into urine. They also help maintain blood pressure and the correct
 levels of chemicals in the body.

Long-term
 dialysis - a method replicating many of the kidney's functions - is 
necessary with ERF, and a transplant is carried out if possible.

Adults
 are recommended by the NHS to have a healthy diet, regularly exercise 
and not drink too much alcohol, to reduce the chances of chronic kidney 
disease developing.

It is 
estimated that around one in five men and one in four women aged between
 65 and 74 has chronic kidney disease. There is no cure, but treatment 
can slow or halt its progression.

Now Eryn is a happy, healthy two-year-old and should go on to live a normal life. She has just taken her first few steps.

Mrs
 Howie said: ‘She's eating real food now - she used to be fed through a 
tube in her nose, and her medication is gradually coming down.’

Mr
 Howie added: ‘Now she's a different child. She took her first full 
steps yesterday, she's doing things we thought she'd never do.

‘Things
 finally look like they're turning a corner and there's a light at the 
end of the tunnel. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster. We've just had to
 deal with what we had to deal with as it came.

‘We are eternally thankful to the amazing renal team at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, who made Eryn's transplant possible.’

The family are determined to make people aware of the difference a donation can make.

Mrs Howie said: ‘There are children all over the world with kidney problems that need help, and it's not widely recognised.

‘It's a completely different world that you don't know about unless you have a poorly child. People are just not aware.’
