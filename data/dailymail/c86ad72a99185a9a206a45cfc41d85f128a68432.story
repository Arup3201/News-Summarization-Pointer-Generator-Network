The laboratory which created Dolly the sheep has produced a disease-resistant piglet

The laboratory which created Dolly the sheep has produced a disease-resistant piglet using a new technique which is simpler than cloning.

It is believed the development could bring GM meat a step closer.

The piglet, known only as 'Pig 26', was created through a process called 'gene editing' at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute four months ago.

It was engineered to have a gene making it immune to African swine 
fever which can kill European pigs within 24 hours of 
infection.

The technique is faster and more efficient than existing methods, and also does not involve the use of antibiotic-resistance genes.

One of the main arguments against the use of GM is based on the use of the genes which campaigners fear could lead to crucial drugs becoming ineffective.

Scientists looking for ways to feed the ever growing population hope it could make genetic engineering of livestock more publicly acceptable, the Telegraph reports.

The process works by snipping an animal's DNA and inserting new genetic material.

Researchers say it copies a natural genetic mutation and would therefore by impossible to tell by looking at an animal's DNA whether it had been modified.

It has a success rate of ten to 15 per cent compared to less than one per cent for the existing methods used by scientists.

It can also be carried out on a fertilised egg without the need for cloning techniques.

Prof Bruce Whitelaw told the paper: 'We can get rid of antibiotic resistance and for some situations we can get rid of cloning as well. I think cloning does have some baggage attached to it.'

The gene was taken from wild African pigs. 

The creatures are naturally immune to the African fever virus but cannot breed with European species.

The piglet, known only as 'Pig 26', was created through a process called 'gene editing' at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute where Dolly the sheep was created 17 years ago

It is now hoped other livestock, such as cattle and sheep immune to a host of diseases, could become immune to a host of other diseases with the technique.

The first genetically modified meat and fish could be approved this summer.

Authorities in the US are expected to 
grant approval to Aquabounty salmon, which has been modified to grow 
twice as fast as normal salmon.

And
experts trying to combat world hunger are calling on the British 
Government to back the use of GM farm animals on the dinner table here.

The
push into GM meat could see the production of giant pigs, hens that 
have only female chicks and cattle made disease resistant using genes 
from baboons.

But the 
move will alarm critics of the use of GM technology who are still 
battling to block the expansion of genetically modified crops

Prof Whitelaw said the technique was garnering interest from commercial companies and international regulators are now considering how to classify it.

Professor Helen Sang, GM animal expert at the Roslin Institute – where Dolly the sheep was cloned – insisted fears surrounding ‘Frankenstein’ foods can be overcome.

Roslin scientists yesterday called on the Government to support the spread of GM into farm animals but admit there will need to be a change in attitude among British families and retailers.
