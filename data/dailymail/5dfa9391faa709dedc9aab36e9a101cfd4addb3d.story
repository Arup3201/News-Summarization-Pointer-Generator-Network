Carlo Tavecchio, the candidate at the centre of a racism controversy, has been elected as the new president of the Italian Football Federation.

The 71-year-old beat former AC Milan player Demetrio Albertini after three rounds of voting in Rome, the governing body announced through its official Twitter account on Monday afternoon.

Tavecchio drew heavy criticism last month by making an allegedly racist comment about 'eating bananas' during an address to a summer assembly of Italy's amateur leagues.

But despite the fact Serie A clubs including Fiorentina and Sampdoria withdrew their backing in the weeks leading up to the elective assembly, Tavecchio was confirmed as Giancarlo Abete's successor at the FIGC when polling 63.33 per cent of the third-round votes after the first two rounds proved inconclusive.

He polled 60.20 per cent to Albertini's 35.46 per cent in the first round, which had required a quorum of 75 per cent, and had 63.18 per cent of the votes to his opponent's 34.07 per cent in a second round requiring a quorum of 66 per cent.

The delegation was comprised of 278 representatives from Serie A, Serie B, the Lega Pro, the Amateur League, the Players' Association, the Coaches' Association and the Referees' Association.

The Lega Pro, which represents 60 third and fourth division teams, last week said nearly all of its members would back Tavecchio, who had been vice-president of the FIGC since 2009.

The campaign against his candidacy began when he made an allegedly racist comment when using a fictional example to try to make a point about the number of foreign players in the Italian leagues.

Quoted in La Repubblica, Tavecchio said: 'England identifies the players coming in and, if they are professional, they are allowed to play.

'Here, on the other hand, let's say there's (fictional player) Opti Poba, who has come here, who previously was eating bananas and now is a first-team player for Lazio.

'In England he has to demonstrate his CV and his pedigree.'

He subsequently apologised but FIFA has since asked the FIGC to conduct an investigation into the comments and to report its findings back to the world governing body.

Following his election Tavecchio pledged to prove his doubters wrong.

He told FIGC.it: 'I will be a president for everybody, and especially for those who have legitimately expressed their dissent about me taking the job.

'I wish to thank those who have confirmed their confidence in me and who have made me feel supported even during some difficult times.

'Reforming the system can only be done if we work together, there are no magic wands.

'Let us embrace a culture of hard work. I invite all members to abandon feelings of division and to get to work.

'By August 18 I will be able to present to you a list of the things I will have worked on this week.'

Among his first tasks will be selecting a new head coach for the Italian national team.

Cesare Prandelli resigned following a disappointing World Cup, with former Juventus boss Antonio Conte and ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini reportedly leading the race to replace him.
