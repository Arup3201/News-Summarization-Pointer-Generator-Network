Gullible workers were tricked into trashing their own convenience store by a prank caller posing as their corporate bosses.

Two employees at a roadside Circle K store in Globe, Arizona, let off fire extinguishers inside the store, smashed up a computer and threw extinguishers through store windows at the unknown caller's behest.

He apparently convinced the pair to destroy their workplace, while customers were inside, by claiming he was calling from Circle K's corporate security department.

Trashed: This Circle K store in Globe, Arizona, had all but one of its widows broken by employees who were tricked into throwing fire extinguishers through them

Tricked: Two gullible employees thought the outlandish instructions were coming from their superiors in Circle K's corporate security department

They followed the commands because they were told it was the only way to shut off a silent fire alarm, police said.

After smashing the computer, the two realized something was amiss, and stopped their rampage, local news station Fox10 Phoenix reported.

By this time the outlet, which doubles as a gas station, was left so battered it was forced to close. Only one window was left intact.

The store was open the day after the Wednesday evening call, after the windows had been boarded up.

It was not clear exactly how much it will cost to undo the carnage unleashed by the prank phone call, though police said that 'a significant amount of damage' was caused. 

Red-faced Circle K bosses reportedly asked Fox10 not to run the story after being approached by reporters.

Nobody was available for comment when DailyMail.com called.

Globe Police department say they do not yet know who made the call, but are looking through phone records in the hope of tracking him down.
