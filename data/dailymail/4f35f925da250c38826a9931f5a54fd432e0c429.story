The 30-year-old man driving a delivery that ran into a stationary car carrying a family-of-five, flipping on top and killing them all, was high on prescirption drugs at the time of the crash and fell asleep behind the wheel as a result.

Joshua Smith had 'identifiable quantities of narcotics in his system at the time of the collision' on May 11 in Hesperia, California, according to blood results released by the San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department on Tuesday.

The horrific crash killed a mother, father and their children, who were on their way to Disneyland to celebrate both Mothers Day and their youngest child's 5th birthday.

Tragic: Little Cynthia Jimenez, pictured, was killed traveling to celebrate her fifth birthday with her family at Disneyland when she was killed by a man allegedly driving under the influence of prescription drugs

Victims: Her mother, Angelica Garcia, left, father, Gerardo Jimenez, center right, and two brothers, Ivan, 2 and Freddie, 9, pictured, were all killed in the wreck, on Main Street in Hesperia, San Bernadino County on May 11

Investigators believed that Smith lost 
consciousness prior to the collision as a result of the medications, 
causing the crash, according to KTLA.

He was doing a delivery of flowers for Mothers Day.

At the time of the crash he is believed to have said that he looked away for a second.

The victims were identified as Angelica Garcia, 25, her father, Gerardo Jimenez, brothers, Ivan, 2 and Freddie, 9, and daughter Cynthia, whose would have turned five the following day.

Smith is said to have swerved into the left-hand side lane and hit the Honda sedan carrying the family, who were stationary at a stop sign.

He suffered only minor injuries.

Relatives confirmed the family were on their way to Disneyland, which is a about a one hour and 20 minute drive away in Anaheim, according to CBS LA.

Horror crash: The family of five were killed when the delivery van landed on top of their car in Hesperia, California, on Mothers Day

The full car was crushed by the van

The driver of the van, identified as Joshua Smith, 30, made it out with only minor injuries and was treated at the scene

'I've been to scenes where families have suffered great loss (but) all at once, in such a violent manner, is very rare,' sheriff’s Sgt. Doug Hubbard told KTLA at the time.

The collision occurred just before 7a.m. at Main Street and Balsam Avenue in Hesperia, the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department said.

Investigators determined that the van was traveling eastbound on Main Street when it went into westbound lanes, collided with a Honda sedan that was stopped at a stop sign, and landed on top of the car.

Lives cut short: Ivan, 2, pictured left, was only discovered dead in the car hours after the crash, while his brother Freddie, right, died in hospital

Horrific: It wasn't until after the van was removed from on top of the car that the body of the two-year-old boy was found

Crushed: The family were driving to Disneyland in Arnaheim for the day when the crash occurred. They were stopped at a stop sign

Tributes: A man lights candles by a cross erected by people in the area. Five candles were placed at the site to remember the family that was lost

Gerardo Jimenez and his son Freddie, 
9, made it out of the vehicle and were transported to hospital, but were
 later pronounced dead.

Angelica Garcia and Cynthia were trapped inside the car and pronounced dead at the scene.

Tragically,
 it wasn't until the van was lifted off the car, hours after the crash, 
that authorities found the body of two-year-old Ivan.

No arrests have been made, but the investigation is ongoing.
