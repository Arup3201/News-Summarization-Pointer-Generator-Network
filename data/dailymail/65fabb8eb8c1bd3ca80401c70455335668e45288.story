The bargain one-bedroom property in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, South Wales, has only the one toilet which is to be found in a shed at the back of the garden.

The diminutive home, deep in the Welsh Valleys has been dubbed one of the cheapest houses on the UK market and will be put up for for auction with a rock-bottom price tag in two weeks' time.

While many parts of Britain are going through a housing boom and the average London home now in the region of £400,000, the house is expected buck the trend and sell for less than the cost of a cheap small car.

With a guide price of just £8,000 the brochure boasts of features such as double glazing and an outdoor toilet, but the sellers admit it will require a full renovation.

Paul Fosh, managing director of Paul Fosh Auctions in Newport, who will be conducting the auction, said: 'The mid terrace property, number 3 King Street, is in a popular location and is well placed for access to the arterial A465 Heads of the Valleys link road.

Kitchen extension: The sellers admit the property will need a full restoration

Lounge: The diminutive property will need considerably more than a lick of paint

Bedroom: The property is being put up for auction on February 13

Location location location: The tiny terrace is less than 100 metres away from the local pub

Front garden: Double glazed windows and a satellite dish boost the property's appeal considerably

Rustic charm: The tiny property provides a roof, rooms, a staircase, but little else

'The house has UPVC double glazing with lounge and kitchen on the ground floor and single bedroom above.

'There’s a garden at the front and rear but you’ll have to have a resilient constitution as the loo is outside.

'The compact and appealing property, which could make an ideal commuter pad, would ideally benefit from full renovation and this is reflected in the keen guide price we’ve set at auction.'

The Paul Fosh Auction, will go up for sale, on Thursday, February 13, starting at 5pm at The Park Inn Hotel, in Llanedeyrn, South Wales.

The property is listed as having sold for £16,500 as recently as August last year, however it is now back on the market.

Many parts of the country are currently experiencing a housing boom, but incredibly it is still possible to purchase a home for less than the cost of a small car

Across the country average
 house prices have surged by £14,000, or 8.8 per cent in a single year, 
rising at their fastest pace since 2010 the latest house price index has
 revealed.

The Nationwide announced this week that house 
prices have been rising for 13 consecutive months, the longest unbroken 
run of monthly increase since the financial crisis began in 2007.

Last year we featured a two-bed home in Burnley, Lancashire that went under the hammer for just £1,000.

That 
property was so delapidated that it would have taken thousands of pounds to make
 it liveable, and it is not believed to have sold.
