The charge of murder against Gold Coast man Gable Tostee has been described as 'weak' and 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony when Warriena Wright plunged to her death from his Surfers Paradise apartment last month, a judge has said.

Considering Tostee's bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court, Judge Debra Mullins asked Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden, 'The prosecution case is that the applicant wasn't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from?'.

'That appears to be the most likely scenario,' Ms Farnden said.

Tostee has been in custody since mid-August when he was arrested and charged with murder.

Police documents allege that an audio recording from Tostee's phone reveal the sounds of a struggle, during which someone is choked and taunted.

Tostee has been charged with Ms Wright's murder. Police documents have been filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Tostee's bail application on Monday

'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' Justice Mullins told the accused's barrister, Anthony Kimmins.

'But in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

Justice Mullins postponed the bail application, requesting more information after she read sworn statements by police, Tostee and Tostee's parents about his autism diagnosis.

She said his previous diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum was referenced in the Crown's material, but was not addressed in defence documents.

She said a diagnosis of autism on Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his apartment on the night of August 8, when Ms Wright fell 14 storeys to the pavement below.

'It just struck me that it may not be an irrelevant matter,' Justice Mullins told Mr Kimmins.

Mr Kimmins replied that he wasn't sure when Tostee last visited a specialist, and sought more time to find out.

Tostee's high-rise apartment is investigated by detectives. The secret recordings ultimately led the police to arrest Tostee on August 15.

Police have opposed bail for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Warriena Wright.

Police say Tostee would immediately go back on Tinder if released and contact young women and, given his 'propensity of violence' would pose an 'unacceptable risk' to the community.

A document filed in the bail application in the  says an examination of Tostee's mobile phone 'has identified that he has been in contact with over 250 female persons using the Tinder application since March 2014'.

'Police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media,' a document filed in the court said.

'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.'

Documents filed to the Supreme Court claim the Gold Coast man charged with murdering his New Zealand Tinder date told the young woman 'you're lucky I haven't thrown you off the balcony' before she plunged 14 storeys to her death.

An audio tape made on accused murderer Gable Tostee's phone inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on Queensland's Gold Coast, there is a choking sound, the 28-year-old taunting Ms Wright as she gasps for air, a door sliding open and her screaming, 'no, no no' and 'just let me go home' before he says, 'I would but you have been a bad girl' - and 26 seconds later the sound of a fading scream.

The documents, filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Gable Tostee's bail application hearing, alleged a recording on Mr Tostee's phone captured three hours and 19 minutes of audio from the night that Warriena Tagpuno Wright died.

Tostee maintains his innocence and will fight the charge, after he was arrested on August 15 for Ms Wright's death on August 8.

The document claims the recording started at around 1am.

Tostee, 28, has been charged with the murder of Ms Wright, 26, who suffered a fatal fall from the Surfers Paradise balcony in Queensland on August 8. 

Police say they decided to arrest Tostee on August 15 after finding the recordings.

The documents assert that an fight erupted at around 2.13am.

A male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, according to the police document. Police claim a male accuses the woman of 'beating him up.'

The male voice is also reportedly heard saying, 'I will do what you want, I will be your sex slave.'

A struggle is heard, during which a male voice allegedly says: 'This is f***ing b***s***, you are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony you goddamn little psycho b****'.

The woman tells him, 'no, no, no'.

The man allegedly replies: 'I would, but you have been a bad girl.'

A phone call is then reportedly made to a lawyer.

Police claim that CCTV captures Tostee leaving the building.

It is alleged that the Gold Coast man then ordered pizza within an hour of Ms Wright's death.

Neighbours earlier reported hearing an altercation and the sound of a woman screaming at around 2:30am.

Ms Wright and Tostee contacted each other through dating app Tinder and met in Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise, before returning to Tostee's apartment.

Ms Wright lived in New Zealand's Lower Hutt region and was in Australia for a two-week holiday to attend a wedding. 

Tostee maintains his innocence and says he will fight the charge.
