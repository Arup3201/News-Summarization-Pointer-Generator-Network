Ruben Reyes admitted to murdering three other gang members and burying them in shallow graves

A battle-scared mafia boss known as 'Menace' was arrested after admitting to three grisly murders - and he is also suspected of ordering a hit on a cop.

Ruben Reyes confessed to the crimes after becoming the target of a gang hit himself where he was shot once at his apartment.

He was arrested by FBI agents in San Antonio, Texas, and made an appearance in federal court yesterday where he provided details about the murders of three other high-ranking members of the Texas Mexican Mafia. 

An FBI criminal complaint identified the victims as Mark Anthony Bernal, Carlos Chapa and Johnny Solis.

Reyes, 36, has been charged with using and discharging a firearm in relation to a violent crime but has not been indicted yet.

If convicted, faces between 10 years and life in prison. 

Reyes is also suspected of ordering a hit on a Balcone Heights police officer who was killed in May, according to KSAT 12. 

Julian Pesina was fatally shot while off-duty outside a tattoo parlour in San Antonio he co-owned.

He was reportedly under investigation for drug activity and linked to the notorious gang. He also had tattoos worn by Texas Mafia Members. 

On November 9, Reyes was targeted by four masked men and shot once in the back but survived the attack.

He contacted the police to report the shooting two days later and revealed information about the unsolved murders.

He confessed to homicide detectives that he had murdered all three men and buried their bodies in Pearsall with another gang member.

According to the affidavit, he was ordered to kill the men after his gang believed they had 'mishandled' around $60,000 and made 'poor decisions' in day-to-day operations.

He said met Mr Chapa at Southpark Mall in January this year and later shot him several times inside a pick-up truck. He then dumped his body in a grave that had already been dug.

He shot Mr Bernal in the head several times after luring him to a bar and convincing him to drive him to collect a debt, before taking him to the same grave site as Mr Chapa.

Reyes said he murdered Mr Solis after convincing him to take part in a home invasion and shot him in the head. 

Using the information provided by Reyes, officers later recovered the remains of the victims in shallow graves.

A bail hearing is set for next week.
