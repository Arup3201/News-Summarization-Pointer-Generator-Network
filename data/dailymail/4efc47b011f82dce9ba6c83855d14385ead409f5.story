Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink returned to the English game as manager of League Two club Burton Albion  and admitted: ‘I can’t live without football.’

The 42-year-old former Chelsea striker has demonstrated his desire to start at the bottom by signing a deal until 2017 worth £40,000 a year — less than he earned each week in his heyday — to become only the third black manager in the Football League.

‘Money was not the motivation,’ said Hasselbaink. ‘The motivation was the club, the set-up, the beliefs, the players and the atmosphere. Football is everything for me. I’m not afraid of League Two. You don’t have to serve your time at the bottom, but when you are a young manager you don’t get much of the time you need. Expectancy is a lot higher at the top.

‘I applied for a few jobs but when Burton became available I jumped at it.’

Derby boss Steve McClaren, who gave the Dutchman his first coaching job at Nottingham Forest, approached neighbours Burton about appointing him as Gary Rowett’s successor.

Hasselbaink managed Antwerp in the Belgian league last season but turned down a new contract there to pursue employment in England and be with his family in Surrey. He was on the phone to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers  after a tough first training session in which goalkeeper Dean Lyness suffered a suspected broken leg.

‘I spoke to a lot of people before coming here,’ he added. ‘Steve McClaren, Brendan Rodgers, Gustavo Poyet and also to Alan Pardew, who was very interesting and helpful. Everyone was very positive. I had 51 text messages this morning and yesterday something like 40 — I only have 120 contacts in my phone!’

Hasselbaink, who also played for Leeds, Charlton and Cardiff, retired in 2008 and spent time at Chelsea working on his coaching badges. ‘Luiz Felipe Scolari was there then, and after that Guus Hiddink,’ he said. ‘I didn’t come across Jose Mourinho that often. He’s very private.’

Even though he joins Huddersfield boss Chris Powell and Carlisle’s Keith Curle as the only black managers in the top four divisions, it is not an issue Hasselbaink is keen to dwell on. Nor would he like to see the introduction of the NFL’s Rooney Rule that requires teams to interview candidates from ethnic minorities. ‘It has nothing to do with being the third black manager, please, no,’ he said. ‘I’m proud to be black and give that back to my kids, but I don’t see myself as a role model for black people.

‘And I wouldn’t want to be interviewed because of the Rooney Rule. I would want somebody to call me because I’m the right person for the job.’
