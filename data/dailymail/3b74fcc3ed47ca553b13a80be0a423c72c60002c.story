A Florida woman is facing life in prison after she was convicted of killing her estranged husband during a 'date rape' sex game.

Anita Smithey, 46, sobbed and collapsed in court after she was found guilty of second degree murder following the death of Robert Cline III in May 2010.

She shot him in his Oviedo, Florida, home while they were having sex during violent role play which involved using a knife as a prop. 

Convicted: Anita Smithey, 46, sobbed in court after she was found guilty of second degree murder following the death of her estranged husband Robert Cline III in May 2010

Injuries: The day after the shooting, she was pictured with knife marks around her throat, covered in cuts and bruises and with a shallow stab mark on her side. Prosecutors said they believe these were self-inflicted

The couple were separated at the time, but would still meet up every Monday night to have sex. 

Prosecutors said it was scene they would frequently act out, according to theOrlando Sentinel.

Smithey's attorneys said she shot him in self-defense because he was raping her and she wanted to go home, but prosecutors said it was just rough, consensual sex.

She had got in the shower and was preparing to leave, but she claims Cline then grabbed her again, tossed her back onto the bed and assaulted her.  

The day after the shooting, she had knife marks on her throat, a chipped tooth, facial bruises and a shallow stab wound on her side, but the court heard some of these may have been self-inflicted.

Assistant State Attorney Kelly Jo Hines told Smithey: 'You're not allowed to kill a houseguest who's overstayed their visit.

Reaction: She collapsed into her attorney;s arms after the verdict was read out. Smithey claims she shot her husband in self-defense because he was raping her, but prosecutors said it was just rough consensual

The jury took less than three hours to come to a guilty verdict.

Over the course of the investigation Smithey's accounts of what happened varied.

At first she told officers the gun had gone off by accident, but she then changed the story to say she had actually pulled the trigger. 

Assistant State Attorney Stacey Salmons told jurors there was no rape and argued that she inflicted the cuts on herself. 

Some witnesses who were at the scene described Smithey as crying and hysterical, but paramedic who rode with her in an ambulance believed she acting.

A nurse who performed a rape exam on her in the aftermath said she thought she had been a victim of sexual assault. 

Prospect: The 46-year-old is facing life in prison for the murder. Some of those who attended the scene after the death said they believed Smithey was acting while crying and hysterical
