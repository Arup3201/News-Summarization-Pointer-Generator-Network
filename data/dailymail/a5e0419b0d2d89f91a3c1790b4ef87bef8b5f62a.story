A circus has had two dogs confiscated – after police said they were painted black and white to fool customers who expected to see pandas.

Police in Brescia, Italy, seized the chow chows amid claims circus-goers were being tricked into handing over cash just to pose for photos with the animals.

Officers were tipped off about the male and female animals, which were being put on display before the circus show started.

According to the website Thelocal.it, specialist police officers then swooped and confiscated the dogs which had been painted black and white.

Children had been paying a fee to have their photo taken with the animals - believing them to be pandas, police said. 

The dogs were said to be in a healthy state when they were taken away but had ‘watery eyes’.

The website quotes a police spokesman as saying that this was ‘probably aggravated by the continuous exposure to camera flashes’.

Officers acted on animal cruelty grounds, and the local reports that the owners are facing charges over the dogs’ false passports.

Police said that the chow chows were brought in from Hungary and may have been six months younger than their documents had suggested.

The 'Orfei' circus involved has today denied the allegations insisting that they never claimed the dogs were pandas.

The circus secretar, Riccardo Gravina reportedly told IBTimes: 'It's obvious they are dogs.

'No animal was mistreated. They are like children to us.'
