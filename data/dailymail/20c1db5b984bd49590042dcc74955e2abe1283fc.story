More than 6,000 people have died from Ebola, not 7,000 as was reported by the World Health Organisation, it has emerged.

'An error' in the number of deaths attributed to the disease in Liberia has been blamed for the error.

According to the revised data, published yesterday by the WHO, the worst Ebola epidemic since the virus was first discovered in 1976, has now claimed 5,987 lives.

All but around 15 of those deaths have hit the three countries at the heart of the crisis in West Africa - Guinea, where the outbreak began last December, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The World Health Organisation has confirmed that nearly 6,000 people have lost their lives to Ebola, not nearly 7,000 as was previously reported

The UN health agency said in a statement: 'An error on reported total number of deaths in Liberia was published on November 28.

'This number has been corrected.' 

'The cumulative total number of deaths in Liberia is 3,145,' it said, down from Friday's figure of 4,181.

No further explanation was given for the revision. 

When the agency gave its previous toll of 6,928 deaths on Friday, up from 5,674 two days earlier, it put the steep hike in Liberia fatalities down to 'a reconciliation of historical numbers' and not to new deaths in recent days.

It came as Spain was declared free from Ebola, according to the WHO.

No new cases have been reported since nurse Teresa Romero Ramos, tested negative and was released from hospital.

Since then, 42 days have passed - double the incubation period for the virus - without another case, allowing officials to declare the country Ebola-free. 

Spanish authorities had been monitoring 87 people who came into contact with healthcare worker Teresa Romero Ramos, 15 of whom were considered high-risk and were quarantined at a Madrid hospital, WHO said. 

'An error' in the number of deaths attributed to the virus in Liberia was blamed for the miscalculation

It came as the WHO declared Spain free of Ebola, it having been 42 days since nursing assistant Teresa Romero Ramos tested negative for the virus having overcome the disease

In addition 145 hospital employees who helped care for Ms Romero during her stay at the Carlos III Hospital, were monitored.

The WHO statement said it 'commends Spain for the measures put in place to identify potential cases and prevent further transmission of the Ebola virus.' 

Ms Romero contracted the disease while helping care for a missionary who was brought back from West Africa but died.

Following Monday's correction, the WHO said that as of November 28, Guinea had recorded 2,155 cases and 1,312 deaths, Liberia saw 7,635 cases and 3,145 deaths while Sierra Leone reported 7,109 cases and 1,530 deaths.

There have also been 15 fatalities in other countries, bringing the total to 6,002.

Also on Monday, the WHO said 'meaningful progress' had been made towards reducing the spread of Ebola by isolating patients and burying bodies safely.

But Assistant Director-General Bruce Aylward said that a target for 100 percent isolation of patients and 100 percent safe burials by January 1 will be 'challenging' to meet.

He warned that in Liberia there were signs of 'a sense of complacency setting in'.
