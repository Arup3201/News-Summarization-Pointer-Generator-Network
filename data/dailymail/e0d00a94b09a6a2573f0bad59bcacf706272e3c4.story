A Florida couple have been charged with child abuse after keeping two children locked in a cage in what police described as a 'house of horrors.'

Sean Pearson and Jessica Rowland were accused of treating the 11 year old boy and 12 year old girl like a 'rabid dog.'

Polk County Police chief Grady Judd said the victims were put into a cage and left in a closet.

House of horrors: Sean Pearson, 33, (left) and Jessica Rowland are accused of beating a brother and sister aged 11 ad 12 in their Florida home where they strung them up by the wrists and kept them locked in a cage

The 12 year old girl had her head shaved and also had her wrists tied together and the rope strung over a beam as a form of punishment

'You can’t imagine treating your worst enemy the way they treated these two babies,' said Polk County Sheriff Judd.

The children were rescued from a home in Lakeland, Florida, which Judd called a “house of horrors.”

The couple were looking after the children but authorities did not say what relationship they were to the pair.

According to an arrest affidavit the couple forced the children to sit on cans of vegetables until their bottoms turned numb.

The 12 year old girl was also forcibly fed prescription pills to calm her down. Police said the pills belonged to 33 year old Pearson for his bi-polar disorder.

The affidavit revealed the couple would encourage the children to fight each other while they say and watched. When the children screamed too loudly they would cover up their mouths with their hands.

Neighbor Randi Evans, who alerted police to the alleged abuse, said he would often hear the screams of the children.

'They were in pain screams, scared screams,' he told WFLA TV.

Evans called police after he watched as the naked children were hosed down with a pressure washer outside their home.

Evans said the younger child had a red mark on his back.

Pearson, who was charged with sexual battery on a victim under the age of 12 in 2005, told detectives he and his 21 year old girlfriend disciplined the children.

He told investigators he could 'write a book' on the discipline.

Sheriff Judd said he went into great detail about what he did to the children prompting the investigation and their arrest.

Pearson and Rowland were being held on a combined bond of $400,00 at the Polk County Jail after facing six aggravated child abuse charges.
