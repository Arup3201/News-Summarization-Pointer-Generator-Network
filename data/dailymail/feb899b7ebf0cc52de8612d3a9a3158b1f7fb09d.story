Authorities are hunting for a group of men who were 'harassing' a great white shark while boating off the coast of South Australia.

A video posted to Facebook shows the men trying to bait the shark, which is a protected species, while fishing and drinking beer.

None of the men's faces are shown in the footage, which was filmed off Blanche Harbour near Port Augusta - about 300km north-west of Adelaide, but fisheries officers from the Department of Primary Industries are trying to identify and find them, the ABC reported.

In the video, the men can be heard laughing as one of them cast out a line reel hooked to a large hunk of red meat.

'Oh my god… how big is that?' they can be heard saying as they assess the shark's size.

'Here he goes, he's gonna grab it,' another man says.
