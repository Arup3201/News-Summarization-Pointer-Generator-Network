Amazon has followed in the footsteps of a slew of other retailers by bringing forward its Boxing Day sale to Christmas Day.

The online store expects this December 25 to be its busiest after spending on the day trebled over the past five years, in part thanks to families trying out Kindles, iPads and tablets they have been given as gifts.

The proliferation of smartphones, home broadband and other gadgets also makes it much easier to make a purchase - and the price-cuts will make logging on as tempting as another slice of Yule log.

Amazon's deals will include clearance offers, discounted digital goods and ‘lightning deals’ – limited quantity, limited time deals.

The retailer will also price-match 'real-life' shops across millions of products, in a sale that will start at 9am a week today and last until January 1.

Bargains will include up to 80 per cent off apps, 67 per cent off six-month LOVEFilm subscriptions and reduced-price products including DVDs, toothbrushes and flat-screen TVs.

Those who found a Kindle lying under the tree will be able to snap up buy-one-get-one-half-price accessories for their new toy.

Xavier Garambois, vice president of EU retail at Amazon, said: 'The digital revolution has certainly played a part in this growth and Christmas Day is our biggest day of the year for MP3 and Kindle Book downloads as many people are buying content for their new devices that they have just received.

'It’s not just digital items though. We are seeing purchases of everything from baby products to women’s clothing rapidly growing on Christmas Day. Many customers are shopping on Christmas Day in a way that has previously only been seen in the retail industry on Boxing Day.'

Managing Director Christopher North added: 'Digital products are clear winners on Christmas Day due to the instant satisfaction they give of being able to read or listen to them immediately.'

Amazon is following many other stores in making pre-Boxing Day Sales a new tradition.

Last year, online shoppers spent £186million on Christmas Day, up from £153million the year before, with people logging on as early as 6am.

Sales increase throughout the morning, rising to a peak at noon as people raced to buy before sitting down to Christmas lunch, according to an analysis by Halfords.

Shopping then drops off steadily from 1pm to 4pm, and picks up again with only a slight slowdown around 8pm when the TV channels started their top shows.

Online transactions then tend to rise from 9pm, peaking at 11pm, before sales fall steeply as satiated revellers crawl into bed.

Debenhams said Christmas Day traffic on its website was up 75 per cent last year as shoppers looked to snap up bargains before Boxing Day sales began in store. Children’s clothes were top of the list.

Harrods will be offering up to 70 per cent off lines by leading designers including Marc Jacobs, Anya Hindmarch and Ralph Lauren from December 25 in its winter sale.
