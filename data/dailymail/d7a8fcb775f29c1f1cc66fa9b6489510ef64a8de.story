This incredible image reveals the world's biggest wind farm - the London Array - seen from space.

The fascinating photograph taken by Nasa's Landsat 8 satellite shows the area 12 miles off the coast of Kent and Essex in the Thames Estuary.

Each of the 650 482-ft tall wind turbines are clearly visible as white dots sitting in the silt generated where the Thames meets the North Sea.

The London Array is an off-shore wind farm in the Thames Estuary.

It is located approximately 12 miles (20km) from the Kent and Essex coasts.

The farm has a maximum generating power of 630 megawatts, enough to supply as many as 500,000 homes.

It
 has been fully operational since 8 April, 2013 and the turbines are spread over 40 square miles with each generator sitting between 2,100 and 3,900ft apart.

The Array is eventually supposed to grow to 95 square miles.

It has been fully operational since April 8, 2013 and this recently published image was taken 20 days after its launch, showing the massive scale of the site.

According to Nasa's Earth Observatory, the turbines are spread over 40 square miles with each generator sitting between 2,100 and 3,900ft apart.

Each is connected by cables buried under the seafloor, and power is transmitted to two substations offshore and to an onshore station at Cleve Hill near Graveney, on the north coast of Kent.

With construction operations working out of Ramsgate, the Array is eventually supposed to grow to 95 square miles.

It has been fully operational since April 8th last year and this recently published image was taken 20 days later showing the massive scale of the site in Kent

The wind farm sits on two natural sandbanks, with water as deep as 80 feet (25m).

The site was chosen because of its proximity to onshore electric power infrastructure and because it stays out of the main shipping lanes through the area.

Promoters of the London Array project believe that it will reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tons, equal to the emissions of 300,000 automobiles.

Critics of the project and its second phase are concerned that the wind farm will decimate the population of red-throated divers and other bird species.

This is not the first time Landsat 8 has taken stunning images of planet Earth. Last year it photographed images of the Grand Canyon in astonishing detail as well as miniature islands inside Lake Michigan in the U.S..
