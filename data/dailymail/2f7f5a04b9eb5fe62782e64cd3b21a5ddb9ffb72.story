Two new earthquakes - the biggest so far - shook Iceland's Barbarbunga volcano today as the country remained on alert for a major eruption.

Iceland's Meteorological Office said the quakes in the early hours had a magnitude of 5.3 and 5.1, an escalation in strength after thousands of tremors shook the volcano over the last week.

It prompted further fears that the volcano could erupt, spewing ash into the atmosphere in an echo of the cloud which caused chaotic flight delays throughout Europe in April 2010.

Uncertainty: The two largest earthquakes so far were recorded at the Barbarbunga volcano in Iceland after a red alert was issued for flights. This afternoon the alert was downgraded to orange, but activity continued

Road closed: Residents were advised to stay away from the volcano and a no-fly zone was introduced

Yesterday Iceland's authorities issued a red alert for aviation - the highest on a five-point scale.

A no-fly zone was declared as a precaution measuring 100 nautical miles by 140 nautical miles (185 kilometers by 260 kilometers) around the epicentre of the quakes.

This afternoon the risk was downgraded to orange after authorities said there were no signs of an imminent eruption.

However, Iceland's Civil Protection Department said seismic activity continued underneath the huge glacier which has been the focus of the quakes.

The volcano is in a mountain range on the southern part of the island underneath the vast Vatnajokull glacier. 

Not a good time for a walk: Magma is flowing beneath the volcano and could come to the surface. Iceland's authorities said this afternoon an eruption did not appear imminent but they were keeping a close watch

Seismologists said yesterday that magma was moving under the glacier but so far had travelled horizontally at a depth of 3 to 6 miles. The volcano will erupt if the magma melts the ice above. 

On Saturday scientists reported a small eruption under the ice, but it was not visible on the surface, and the Met Office later said it appeared to have stopped. 

Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said air travel would not be affected until an eruption actually breaks the ice.

A spokesman said: 'The Met Office will be monitoring what's occurring. They will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air.

'If the eruption does occur we will issue what's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions. It's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly.' 

A 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano caused a week of international aviation chaos, with more than 100,000 flights cancelled.

Aviation officials closed Europe's air space for five days out of fear that volcanic ash could harm jet engines.

Any new eruption is likely to be less disruptive because European aviation authorities have changed their policy in the wake of the chaos.

Airlines now receive detailed information about the location and density of ash clouds, although decisions on whether to fly are still left to them and national regulators.

Britain's National Air Traffic Service said it was monitoring what it called a 'dynamic situation' but was expecting normal operations today.

However, alternative flight paths were being used across the Atlantic as a precaution.

Virgin Atlantic also said a London-to-San Francisco flight took a slight detour yesterday to avoid Iceland's no-fly zone.
