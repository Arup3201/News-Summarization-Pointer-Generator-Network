Louis van Gaal has built up a close bond with the Manchester United players despite his tough approach, according to Juan Mata.

The Spain international revealed earlier this week that he and former manager Jose Mourinho did not speak by the time he was sold to the Old Trafford club for £37.1million in January.

But the former Chelsea midfielder says there is no such communication issues between Van Gaal and the United squad.

'He is hard when he should be but then he is someone who is very close to the players,' Mata said in the Sun.

'He likes to talk a lot with us and asks our opinion of the exercises we do in training and if there are things he hasn't seen.

'He tries to get players brining solutions to benefit the group. He is an honest man.'

Juan Mata is set to face his former club for the first time on Sunday when Manchester United welcome league-leaders Chelsea to Old Trafford.

The fixture will also see bosses Van Gaal and Mourinho reunited - the Chelsea manager was in charge of opposition scouting for Van Gaal while he was manager of Barcelona.
