Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is still rejecting calls for his resignation saying on Monday in his first public appearance since he admitted to smoking crack cocaine that he is ‘not going anywhere’.

The embattled politician, who made the appearance at the city’s Remembrance Day ceremony in front of Old City Hall, was greeted with a mixture of light applause and booing when he made his speech to a crowd huddled under umbrellas.

Ford admitted smoking crack cocaine last week in a ‘drunken stupor’, despite at first denying he had taken the drug.

'Yes I have smoked crack cocaine': Ford has admitted he took the substance but that he does not remember it as he was too drunk

Ford first faced allegations in May that he had been caught on video puffing from a glass crack pipe.

On November 5 he finally admitted he had taken the drug 
about a year ago, but was not an addict.

He defied calls to quit, vowing to 
run for re-election next year.

‘Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine,’ Ford said outside his office on November 5, according to BBC News.

‘There have been times when I've been in a drunken stupor. That's why I want to see the tape.

‘I
want everyone in the city to see this tape. I don't even recall there 
being a tape or video. I want to see the state that I was in.’

Police confirmed a week prior to his confession that they had obtained a long-reported video that appears to show Ford using crack cocaine.

During the Remembrance Day ceremony on Monday, Ford laid a wreath at the base of the cenotaph and shook hands with veterans in the crowd.

The mayor was greeted with shouts of support and heckling as he walked through Nathan Phillips Square surrounded by a phalanx of City Hall security guards.

‘I'm not going anywhere, guaranteed,’ he told one supporter, according to the Toronto Sun.

Ford's allies have been urging him to take a leave of absence to deal with his substance abuse issues, but he has so far resisted those calls.

Ford ignored reporters' questions as he walked back into City Hall, including a question relating to his drug habit: ‘Rob, do you smoke your own pipe or do you use somebody's pipe?’

When he got back to City Hall, Ford greeted veterans in the rotunda and then disappeared into his office.

On Wednesday, the Toronto city council will debate various motions relating to the crack cocaine scandal, including asking Ford to formally apologizing for lying about his drug use as well whether the mayor should take a leave of absence to get healthy.

Councillors may ask the province to intervene and remove Ford if he won't step down, although that is unlikely, according to the Toronto Star.

Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, who is putting forward one of those motions, believes Ford needs to take a break from city hall.

'He can't speak with any type of moral authority on the issue of crime and safety or about the issue of drug use. He talks about creating jobs.'

Not stepping down: Ford guarantees his supporters that he's 'not going anywhere'

These issues will be debated at the 
meeting and Ford will take questions from councillors — settling the 
stage for one of the most heated council debates in Canada's recent 
history.

The explosive allegation had been
made public following the release of documents that form the basis of a
major drug investigation.

Police
say they rummaged through the garbage of the major of Canada's largest 
city and conducted an extensive surveillance operation to monitor him 
and close friend Alexander Lisi.

Lisis was Ford's sometime driver, who has been 
charged with marijana trafficking and possession.

While he denies the video exists, two reporters from the Toronto Star said they have seen it.

Both
the Star and US website Gawker.com claimed they had been offered to buy
the video, which was taken on a cell phone and has not been released 
publicly.

Police said Ford was put under surveillance after the allegations were made.

Forensics have since the located a 'digital file' of the video from a hard drive after it had been deleted.

Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said the video is 'consistent with what had been previously described in various media reports'.

'I
think it’s fair to say the mayor does appear in that video but I’m not 
going to get into the detail of what activities is depicted in that 
video,' Chief Blair said in a news conference at a police headquarters.

Chief Blair said he was 'disappointed' after viewing the video.

In another twist, Lisi, already facing drug charges, has been taken into custody today and charged with extortion.

Police said 'the accused made extortive efforts to retrieve a recording'.

The
documents also show Ford receiving suspicious packages from Lisi on 
several occasions, some which were caught on camera and released to the 
media.

Evidence: This widespread image of Rob Ford is allegedly connected to the crack video

'Lisi approached the
driver's side of the Mayor's vehicle with a small white gift bag in 
hand; he then walked around to the passenger side and got on board,' 
reads one document dated July 30, 2013.

'After a few minutes Lisi exited the Escalade empty handed and walked back to his Range Range Rover.'

Another dated July 28 says Lisi 'constantly used counter surveillance techniques' when he met with Ford that day.

On
August 13 documents say Lisi and Ford met and 'made their way into a 
secluded area of the adjacent woods where they were obscured from 
surveillance efforts and stayed for approximately one hour'.

Police documented Lisi exchanging several phone calls with Ford, using 
four different numbers to reach him.

Starting August 7, 
when police began tracking the phone numbers of calls to and from Lisi's
cellphone, until September 19, Ford and Lisi exchanged 349 phone calls.

Ford recently vouched for Lisi in a separate criminal case, praising his leadership skills in a letter filed with the court.

The letter was part of a report prepared by a probation officer after Lisi was convicted of threatening to kill a woman.

Ford angrily yelled at 
reporters two weeks ago to get off his property during a heated exchange before 
he left his house in the morning.

He didn't respond to numerous questions about the allegations.

Ford
said previously that he was shocked when Lisi was arrested earlier this
month, calling him a 'good guy' and saying he doesn't abandon his 
friends.

The documents 
also say that Payman Aboodowleh, a volunteer football coach at Don Bosco
Catholic Secondary School, where Ford coached the team, told police 
that Lisi met Ford through him.

He told police he was 'mad at Lisi because he was fuelling the mayor's drug abuse', the document says.

Ford
former staffer, Chris Fickel, told police he didn't know where Ford got
marijuana from, but 'has heard that 'Sandro', Lisi's nickname, may be 
the person who provides the mayor with marijuana and possibly cocaine,' 
the document alleges.

However,
Fickel added, he has never seen Lisi provide the mayor with drugs. The 
mayor would call Fickle and tell him to tell 'Sandro' that 'I need to 
see him,' Fickle told police.

Facing a press conference at his office two weeks ago, Ford said he wouldn't step down from his position.

He did not take questions from reporters.

'I think everybody has seen the allegations against me today,' he said.

'I
wish I could come out and defend myself, unfortunately I can’t, ’cause 
it’s before the court and that’s all I can say right now.

'I
have no reason to resign, I’m going to go back and return my phone 
calls, gonna be out doing what the people elected me to do and that’s 
save taxpayers money and run a great government.'
