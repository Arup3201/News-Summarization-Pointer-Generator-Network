The boy who was taken on the run by his mother to spare him the ordeal of radiotherapy yesterday finally began the potentially life-saving cancer treatment.

Neon Roberts, seven, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in October, had urgent radiotherapy put on hold while his mother, Sally, fought a high profile legal battle to be allowed to pursue alternative treatments instead for her son.

Mrs Roberts, 37, had objected to Neon receiving radiotherapy because she feared it could cause him to suffer serious side effects such as stunted growth and infertility, which would prevent her from having grandchildren.

But three weeks ago a High Court judge dismissed her case after doctors advised that the child would die within three months if he was denied the 'gold standard' treatment.

Yesterday, Neon had his first round of radiotherapy after he completed a course of play therapy and a practise run on Wednesday to prepare him.

While Mrs Roberts suggested in the past that she would appeal the High Court's decision, no such appeal was made by her lawyers before Neon's treatment began.

Mrs Roberts told the Mail she remained '100 per cent' against radiotherapy being given to her son.

‘I have seen pictures of Neon having the play therapy [to prepare him for radiotherapy]. It is heartbreaking,' she added.

Neon was taken to hospital yesterday by his father, Ben, with whom he has been living since his mother was found by police on the run with her son.

Mrs Roberts previously said she would not be able to cope with seeing her son being taken to hospital for radiotherapy.

'I will cry that day. I won't be able to sleep the night before. I don't know if I could actually take him there. I don't know how I will mentally cope or manage to do it,' she said.

Neon was first diagnosed two months ago with a medulloblastoma tumour, which doctors believed they had removed in full on October 25.

They then wished to start radiotherapy 
treatment but his mother became convinced this was not the best course 
of action after a specialist told her the treatment would 'fry' Neon's 
brain.

After going on the run with her son on December 2 and being found by the police four days later, Mrs Roberts argued her case in the High Court.

The court's decision, however, was delayed after MRI scans showed a 1.5cm squared growth in the cavity from where Neon's original tumour was removed.

Mrs Roberts then objected to further surgery to remove the cancer, leading to the High Court ordering the surgery and then radiotherapy against her wishes.

Mrs Roberts provided the court with a list of alternative treatments to radiotherapy but these were ridiculed by medical experts, who said treating him in any other way would be 'unethical'.

A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy gives young patients up to an 86 per cent chance of survival, the court heard.

But delays in Neon's treatment meant his chances of surviving have already been reduced to 67 per cent.

After the court ruled radiotherapy must be performed, Mr Justice Bodey said he was worried Mrs Roberts's judgment had 'gone awry'.

'I have become concerned about the mother's attitude to Neon's welfare generally,' he said.

'The mother has been through a very stressful time. This sort of news is every parent's worst nightmare, and I have sympathy for her, but I'm worried that her judgment was gone awry on the question of the seriousness of the threat which Neon faces.'

Battle: Neon started radiotherapy treatment yesterday despite his mother's legal bid

He added that Neon must have the treatment because 'one cannot enjoy a quality of life if one isn't alive'.

An order was put into place by the court ensuring Neon lives with his father during the course of his treatment and Mrs Roberts, who spent Christmas away from her son and his twin sister, Elektra, is prohibited from removing Neon from her estranged husband's care.

Mr Roberts, who was said to be 'relieved' after the judge's decision, was unavailable for comment last night.

Mrs Roberts, who threatened to sue if Neon suffers adverse reactions to radiotherapy, plans to continue to fight to be allowed to provide alternative treatments for Neon alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
