A couple are lucky to be alive after a tractor smashed into the front room of their home, in the middle of the night. 

The Melbourne pair, a 34 year old man and 41 year old woman were asleep in their Lyndhurst home when they were awoken by a rumbling sound coming from outside.

The 2009 green John Deere then took out the couple's letterbox, drove across the lawn and ploughed into their master bedroom just before 1am.
