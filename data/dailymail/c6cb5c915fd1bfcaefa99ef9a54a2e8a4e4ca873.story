Barcelona star Neymar and the rest of the Brazil squad have completed their final training session ahead of their clash with Austria.

Dunga's side were put through their paces at the Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna, where they will take on the European side on Tuesday night in a friendly.

Neymar, 22 - who was recently made captain of the national side - was heavily involved in the action as the 2014 World Cup hosts prepared for their match against Marcel Koller's men.

The five-time World Cup winners endured a miserable end to the tournament back in June. A humiliating 7-1 defeat at the hands of eventual winners Germany was followed by 3-0 loss to Louis van Gaal's Holland in the third-place play-off.

But following former manager and captain Dunga's appointment as boss, Brazil have enjoyed a revival, winning all five of their games without conceding a goal. 

The victories included morale-boosting results against continental rivals Argentina and Colombia.

Dunga will be hoping that trend continues on Tuesday against the Austrians, who themselves have not lost a game for over a year and are top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group.

Reports in Brazil suggested that thiago Silva was unhappy that the captaincy had been taken away from him

The only player who hasn't been happy with the recent circumstances surrounding the team is former captain Thiago Silva.

The PSG defender told Brazilian media he was extremely unhappy that nobody had consulted him before Neymar was made captain of the side.

Dunga, though, was predictably firm in his response to the central defender. 

'I respect the history of each individual in the Brazil team but this is my way of working,' Dunga told reporters.

'Nobody loses out on anything when they are with the Brazilian team,' said the prickly coach. 'The Brazil team is the Brazil team, every day here has to be conquered; every single second, every single training session.

'We believe in hierarchy and in rules, so that everyone in the group gets on with everyone else,' he added. 'We believe in organising our work, we don't like improvisation.'
