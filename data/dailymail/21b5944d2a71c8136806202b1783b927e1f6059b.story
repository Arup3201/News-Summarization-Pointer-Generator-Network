Lorna Tulloch pinned the pensioner against some steps with her van, before poking her fingers into his eyes and tried to stab him in the stomach, a court heard

A reality TV row over an 'unfaithful' husband ended with a jealous wife in court after she tried to run him and his father over with her giant camper van, a  court heard.

Lorna and Michael Tulloch appeared on the 'The Jeremy Kyle Show' in July, 2012 after she accused him of a string of infidelities.

However Kyle wasn't able to resolve the couple's differences and weeks later Tulloch drove her giant Fiat Ducato camper van to the distillery cottages where her father-in-law Gordon Tulloch, 77, lived and confronted the pensioner.

She pinned the pensioner against some steps with her van, before poking her fingers into his eyes and tried to stab him in the stomach.

At the High Court case, in Inverness, Lord Jones heard the bizarre details of the attack from advocate depute Shanti Maguire.

Tulloch, of Forres, admitted an indictment of assaulting both men by driving the N registered vehicle at them in the grounds of the Glenburgie Distillery in Forres on August 8, 2012 and stabbing Mr Tulloch senior.

She was originally charged with attempted murder.

Tulloch also had her not guilty pleas accepted to assaulting her husband and father-in-law on three other occasions between January 1, 2003 and July 25, 2012.

Ms Maguire told the judge that Tulloch and her estranged 53-year-old husband had been on the TV show weeks before the offence.

'The accused and Michael had been at odds for some time which culminated in their separation.

There is a long standing history of troubles within the marriage including allegations of infidelity on the part of Michael.

The estranged wife turned the camper van round and drove towards Gordon Tulloch, pictured, and repeatedly tried to run him over, the court heard

'He denies any such infidelity. These allegations culminated in the couple appearing on the Jeremy Kyle show a few weeks before this offence.

'It is understood arguments continued between the parties until the date of this offence.

'Around 12.30pm on August 8, Gordon Tulloch was walking his dog in the distillery and his wife, Annie and Michael were in the parents' home. At the time, Lorna Tulloch lived next door.'

The court was told she drove the van into the distillery and she spoke to Mr Tulloch senior before driving away.

Ms Maguire went on: 'He gesticulated to the rear of the vehicle, gave her the 'V' sing and shouted 'p*** off.'

'She turned the camper van round and drove towards Gordon Tulloch and made repeated attempts to run him over. He ran away and maneouvered his way out of her path.'

The van, being driven at 25mph, collided with three walls as she constantly turned and reversed to try and hit Mr Tulloch, before she eventually managed to pin him in to a set of steps.

Kyle wasn't able to resolve the couple's difference and weeks later Tulloch attempted to run over her father-in-law

Lorna then shouted at him: 'I have got you now. You are a brave man with an audience but when your yersel you're a coward.'

She then scratched his face, pulled his hair and poked her fingers into his eyes before producing a five inch bladed knife tied to her wrist with a shoelace and tried to stab him twice in the stomach.

Ms Maguire said Mr Tulloch senior tried to defend himself and sustained injuries to his ear, fingers and right eye.

'These were not life-threatening. Michael Tulloch came to look for his father who told him: "She's stabbed me and tried to run me over".

'He then helped his father back towards his house when he saw the vehicle being drive towards them, but he managed to get his father home before the accused drove away.'

Lorna Tulloch later told a neighbour: 'I tried to run him over, what am I supposed to do, some folk cannae leave it alone.

'Every time I came out the door he's at me, what am I supposed to do. I tried to stab him.'

Mr Tulloch senior and his son gave victim impact statements which were shown to the judge.

Ms Maguire said: 'Both men fear meeting or seeing the accused again.'

Her defence counsel Shahid Latif said he would reserve his plea of mitigation on the first offender until obligatory reports were prepared.

Lord Jones continued her bail but ordered to stay away from the distillery and the Tulloch family.

The Jeremy Kyle show that they appeared on will not be aired because of legal reasons.

She will be sentenced on December 11.
