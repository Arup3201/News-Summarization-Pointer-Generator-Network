A British family are facing deportation from New Zealand because the father has a brain tumour, it has emerged.

Paul and Sarah Crystal have lived in New Zealand for seven years with their three children, setting up and running two successful businesses.

But their application for residence was rejected because Mr Crystal's tumour means he can no longer work.

According to the New Zealand Herald,Â  Bruce Burrows, from Immigration New Zealand, said the 
family's application for residence was rejected because Mr Crystal was 
'likely to impose significant cost or demands on New Zealand's health 
services'.

Because the family - who have been left financially ruined because of Mr Crystal's illness - do not have a permanent residence they also been refused welfare assistance.

They also can't afford air tickets back to Britain and, even if they could, they would face a six-month period without benefits because they have been away from the country for more than two years.

Mr Crystal, 49, drove petrol tankers in the UK for 20 years before he took up an opportunity to drive for Caltex in New Zealand. They arrived in the country on a work visa in February 2006.

They then proceed to set up two successful businesses after following the required five year period and were about to apply for permanent residence when Mr Crystal was diagnosed with his illness.

Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, Mr Crystal , who lives in Onewhero, in the northern Waikato, said: 'I was actually driving to a new contract when I had a seizure.

'I just had to pull over. I was gone for 20 minutes.'

Following treatment in hospital, doctors removed a lump the size of a golf ball from his brain which has left him with a constant dizzy sensation.

If he attempts to work, he has to lie down for about an hour.

He was given just one year to live following his first operation but now, two years later, he has been told he has just a 20 per cent chance of surviving the next three years.

Whilst her husband was battling severe illness, Mrs Crystal attempted to keep both businesses going.

But after becoming exhausted through working so hard, she became ill with pneumonia last year.

The couple then got behind with their bills and payments and their financial problems spiraled out of control.

They had to sell a number of possessions, including a van.

There was some relief for the family yesterday when the New Zealand government said it had reviewed the family's case and decided it was right to grant the family an emergency benefit while their appeal was being considered.

The family's appeal is currently being considered by the Immigration and Protection Tribunal .
