Santa's little helpers will certainly have their work cut out delivering Christmas presents to one Glasgow housing estate this year, with 18 babies celebrating their first Christmas.

10 of the youngsters live on the same street, while the other eight live nearby.

What's more, the estate's baby boom looks set to continue into 2013, with two more children due to be born to couples who moved in just two months ago.

18 children have been born on one housing estate in Glasgow this year - which means a busy night for Santa

Leanne Corbett, 31, gave birth to the estate's newest arrival Millie just eight weeks ago.Leanne, who lives with husband Colin, 34, a welder, and their three-year-old son Logan, said:

'It's unbelievable. This Christmas is going to be special because it's Millie's first Christmas so we are all very excited.'It's great that we have all these children because they all get to grow up together, though they may have to extend the primary school in a few years.'Morningside Gardens housing estate in Wishaw, Scotland, welcomed 16 babies in the first half of this year, and two since July.

Housing bosses have had to have a special baby area allocated in the estate because of the unprecedented baby boom, which has seen the number of births soar to three times the national average.

The sudden spurt in numbers also means Morningside's population is now too big for the local primary school, which may give council bosses a headache in four years' time.

Sales consultant Victoria Dempsey, known as 'Auntie' to the mums on the estate, said:

'With so many babies celebrating their first Christmas this year, it seems sensible to do so as one joint party, otherwise it'd be January before we got through them all.

'I don't know what it is about Morningside Gardens, but it is a big hit with babies.Ten of the new arrivals all live on the same road, within the collection of terraced houses.

'We are already thinking about a joint street part next year when the children turn one, as it's going to be difficult to keep up with all the first birthdays.'

Mum Morven O'Kane, 30, who lives with her eight month old daughter Holly, added: 'It's incredible, it's something else.

'It certainly seems to be a unique situation, but a very pleasant one.'
