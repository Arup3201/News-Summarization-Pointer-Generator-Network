Steffon Armitage will not be considered for selection by England for the upcoming Six Nations but his form at No 8 means World Cup dream is NOT over.

Stuart Lancaster names his squad for the Six Nations later this month and will again ignore overseas-based players, most notably Armitage, under RFU guidelines.

The England head coach, however, is expected to exercise the 'exceptional circumstances' clause by selecting the Toulon back row in his pre-World Cup training squad in May.

Steffon Armitage has not been selected by England since he moved to France in 2011

Armitage is widely considered one of the best players in Europe, if not the world, and Lancaster has been impressed by his form at No 8 over the last year.

It has been a problem position for England since Lancaster took charge in 2012 and he is keen to explore his options.

Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan won England's man of the series in the autumn but there are concerns over Billy Vunipola's fitness and big-match temperament. With few other alternatives and given his form for Toulon, it is becoming harder to ignore Armitage.

Lancaster has been reluctant to bow to calls for the 29-year-old to be selected as he has kept faith in captain Chris Robshaw and Northampton's Tom Wood on the flanks and Morgan and Vunipola at No 8.

But with the World Cup just eight months away and following a disappointing autumn series he wants his best players available for assessment in May.

The Six Nations is likely to come too soon for Bath rugby league convert Sam Burgess but he too is likely to be picked for the end-of-season training camp, which will include over 40 players.

Armitage saw a move to Bath fall through in October, seemingly scuppering his hopes of adding to his five England caps before or during the World Cup.

But should he impress Lancaster in May then he may well be pulling on the Red Rose again come the World Cup kick-off on September 18.
