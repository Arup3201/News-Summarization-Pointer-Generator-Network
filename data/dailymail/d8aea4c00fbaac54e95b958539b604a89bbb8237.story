Welfare and education reforms will ensure more Britons fill jobs which go to immigrants, David Cameron suggested today.

The Prime Minister said the UK needs 'proper immigration control' with both the European Union and the rest of the world, but suggested changes were needed to prepare people to take the 'jobs that we are creating in our country today'.

It comes as Greencore Group, the UK's biggest sandwich maker, plans to recruit hundreds of workers from Eastern Europe because no Britons will do the job.

David Cameron today said the welfare system must be reformed so more Britons take jobs as part of efforts to tackle immigration

Mr Cameron has vowed to put freedom of movement 'at the heart' of his plans to claw powers back from Brussels.

However, a string of EU leaders have raised objections to the idea of changes to what they see as a fundamental right across the 28-nation bloc.

Home Secretary Theresa May insisted that there was a 'growing recognition' in European capitals of the need to reform freedom of movement rules, as she sought to downplay the Government's looming failure to meet a Conservative pledge on immigration.

Mr Cameron promised to limit net migration to Britain to the tens of thousands 'no ifs, no buts'.

Today Mrs May suggested it was not a promise, but only a 'comment'. Downing Street later stressed it remained an 'objective'.

In a speech to the CBI today, Mr Cameron said that tighter immigration controls must be matched by reforms to the UK's welfare and education systems to enable British workers to fill the jobs currently done by foreigners.

Last night it emerged Greencore Group, which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda, admits it will have to recruit most of the 300 workers it needs from Hungary.

Allyson Russell, Greencore's human resources director, said the company had tried to recruit in the UK, but that it was 'not always the kind of work' which people wanted to do.

The £35million factory, in Northampton, is due to open in early 2016. 

Mrs Russell said low unemployment meant few locals could be found to fill vacancies, although there are around 8,000 jobless in the town, a rate of 6.8 per cent – the national average – while in nearby Corby it is 9.5 per cent and Luton 8.7 per cent.

The Prime Minister told the CBI conference that 'proper' controls on immigration were needed with the EU, and the rest of the world

In Hungary, the average wage is little more than £7,000. Even if workers coming here were on the minimum wage, they would earn almost double that – £13,520 a year.

And they would have their wages topped up with tax credits – seen as a major attraction for EU migrants – and housing benefit.

These mean a migrant with no dependants on the minimum wage has their net income of about £184 a week boosted to £254, studies have suggested.

Mr Cameron suggest more needed to be done to the benefits system to persuade people living in the UK to take jobs on offer.

He said: 'We need to have proper immigration control. We need to do more, both outside the European Union and, frankly, inside the European Union.

'But the flipside of the coin on immigration is a welfare system that rewards work and an education system that turns out people with the skills necessary to do the jobs that we are creating in our country today.

'No immigration policy will succeed unless it's accompanied by that welfare and that education reform as well.'

The latest official figures showed 243,000 more migrants came to the UK than left in the year to March, up from 175,000 the previous year.

Successful efforts to reduce arrivals from the rest of the world to 1990s' levels have been outweighed by a surge from the EU.

The Prime Minister is due to set out detailed proposals for reforming freedom of movement rules before the end of the year in an attempt to reduce the flow.

He has pledged to put Britain's EU membership to an in/out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives form the next government in 2015.

German chancellor Angela Merkel has made clear she regards the principle of free movement of labour within the European Union as non-negotiable and is reported to have warned the Prime Minister that his drive is pushing Britain towards 'a point of no return' on the road to exit from Europe.

Similar concerns were aired by northern European leaders at a summit in Finland last week, where Mr Cameron acknowledged there were 'different perspectives' but insisted there was 'common ground' on the need to reform.

Mrs May told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'What I have seen over the last few years - because I have been talking about freedom of movement for some time in Europe - is a growing recognition from other countries that actually there are issues.

'It is possible to get change in this area. There is a growing concern across the European Union of the way in which free movement is being used. We are seeing it being abused, possibly by criminal gangs that are trafficking human beings, we are seeing it being abused through sham marriages.'

Mr Cameron promised to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' but latest figures show the figure standing at 243,000

Asked about other member states' concerns, she said: 'They have been clear about the principle of freedom of movement. I wouldn't expect them to be anything otherwise.

'We are going to be going into a negotiation that would lead to a referendum in 2017 ... you wouldn't expect everybody to be giving everything away to us at this stage.'

In a 2011 speech setting out his immigration target, Mr Cameron said levels would be cut to manageable levels - 'No ifs, no buts'.

But ministers have been forced to concede that now looks a near-impossibility.

Asked about it, Mrs May said: 'When we made that, er, comment... we said we would be aiming to bring the net migration down to the tens of thousands and we wanted to do that within this parliament. Yes, we were very clear that's what we wanted to do.'
