Chantae Gilman pleaded not guilty to rape at King County Superior Court, Seattle, after being accused of breaking assaulting a man as he slept

A mother-of-three accused of breaking into a man's apartment, pinning him down and raping him while he slept has pleaded not guilty.

Chantae Marie Gilman, 26, appeared at King County Superior Court, Seattle, accused of climbing into bed with a 31-year-old man and having  intercourse with him while he slept.

The alleged victim, who did not know Gilman 'but recognised her as a drug user in the area', woke to find her on top of him, pinning his hands down over his head, according to the charges.

He said he asked her to get off him during the attack in June 2013, but she refused, telling him 'to be quiet', court papers say.

The 31-year-old man from West Seattle was able to force his way out from under her and told her to leave, but she refused again and asked for a cigarette.

He pushed her out the door and threw a cigarette at her, slamming his door shut, they say.

The charges don't indicate how Gilman was able to gain entry into the man's residence. 

He later went to Harborview Medical Center for a sexual-assault examination, and female DNA was recovered during the exam, charging papers say.

Gilman, who recently gave birth to a baby girl, was a month into a  drug and mental-health treatment programme when she was booked into  the King County Jail, Seattle, on Tuesday.

A motion by a defense attorney  to reduce her $100,000 bail was denied by King County Superior Court Judge Patrick Oishi. 

The alleged victim had a sexual-assault examination at Harborview Medical Center after the attack and female DNA was recovered, charging papers say.

Gilman was interviewed by police but said she did not recall being in the man's home or having sex with him.

She told a Seattle police detective she suffers from bipolar disorder and psychosis, according to charging papers.

At some point, Gilman provided a DNA sample, which was later matched by scientists at the State Patrol crime lab to the DNA from the man's sexual-assault exam.

According to a letter in the court record written by the clinical supervisor of the Spokane drug-treatment program, Gilman arranged for Child Protective Services to provide respite care for her newborn daughter while she is in custody awaiting trial.

According the the police report, on the night of the attack the man had attended a birthday party for a neighbor known to Gilman.

'Once arriving home he fell asleep on his bed,' reported Detective Roger Ishimitsu. 'Victim slept very hard due to a long day.'

He woke at 2 a.m. to find the 5'7''. 240-pound Gilman on top of him with his erect penis inside of her.

His hands had been 'pinned down over his head,' according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
