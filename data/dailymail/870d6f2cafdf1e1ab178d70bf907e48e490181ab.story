A teenager physically and emotionally hurt in the Boston Marathon bombings says she was forced to leave a New Hampshire store because she had her service dog with her.

Sydney Corcoran, who has post-traumatic stress disorder, had been shopping at a Nashua branch of TJ Maxx when staff said the dog - Koda - needed to be put in a cart or taken outside.

The service dog has been a crucial companion for 19-year-old Sydney, as she struggles to come to terms with the terror attack in which her mother, Celeste, lost both legs.

Sydney, who was hit by shrapnel during the explosions in April last year, describes the certified service dog as 'my little cheerleader'.

She told WCVB that when the pair were in the store Koda was wearing his working-dog vest to prove he wasn't just a regular pet.

The teenager claimed that the store manager approached her as she shopped and said the store's policy meant the dog would have to go in the shopping cart or leave.

Sydney tried to explain Koda was a working dog and wouldn't comfortably go in the cart, but said she became upset and embarrassed, and left the store close to tears.

Her mom rushed to the store to try to intervene on her daughter's behalf.

Ms Corcoran said she told the manager sorry wasn't good enough and that 'you just made someone with an emotional disorder so much worse.'

Since the bombings Sydney has suffered with stress and was finding it hard to sleep, but Koda had started to help her heal.

'It's knowing that I have this little 
support system that's all my own ... Honestly, I sleep better now,' she said of her constant companion.

TJ Maxx issued a statement saying it was taking the matter seriously and regretted how the situation was treated.Â 

'Customers 
with disabilities who are accompanied by their service animals are 
welcome in our stores at any time,' the statement said.

Ms Corcoran told WCVB she hoped her daughter's experience would make more businesses aware of the laws about service dogs, and the animals' abilities to help those suffering with post traumatic stress.
