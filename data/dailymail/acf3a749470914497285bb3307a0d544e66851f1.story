Julie Bishop has taken a break from talking about foreign affairs to reveal how designer clothes help her do her job and why she envies the wardrobe of Sex and the City character Carrie Bradshaw.

The 58-year-old politician is a fan of ‘investment pieces’ such as Armani suits coupled with Louis Vuitton and Christian Louboutin heels.

‘Give a girl the right shoes and she can take on the world,’ she told News Corp on her passion for feisty red stilettos.

She applies Chanel cosmetics to her face and during her treasured half-hour 6km daily run she dons 2XU and Asics sports gear.

Despite her penchant for designer garb, she claims she does not spend more than half an hour putting herself together before stepping out as Foreign Minister.

‘I can do make-up and hair in a very short space of time. You have to because you’re constantly on the move, constantly on the run,’ she explained.

Ms Bishop accessories with brooches, in a look inspired by US politician Hilary Clinton, and believes it’s her duty to wear clothes ‘that will promote an appropriate image for Australia’.

It’s not all about big international fashion house names though – Ms Bishop also wears pieces from Perth designer Isabel Aujoulet.

The Liberal party's first female Deputy Leader gushed that her dream wardrobe would be ‘Carrie’s out of Sex and the City. The one where she buys an apartment with Big, you know the one, in the movie?’.

Her revealing interview comes on the same day as the politician amused the Twittersphere with her passionate use of emojis in place of words, this time celebrating the start of parliament’s summer break with a cute Santa face and Christmas tree.

Ms Bishop, whose popularity has doubled in recent times ranking her on par with the Prime Minister as the preferred Liberal leader, proved she’s ‘down with the kids’ by bringing out a range of smiley faces and sunshine signs on Twitter.

Her comical tweet on Friday had been shared by 96 people at the time of writing, while one user commented: ‘I think a teenager has hacked your account.’

Another joked: ‘Emoji use level: expert.’

The Foreign Minister thanked her staff at DFAT for a ‘stellar year’ in the tweet and said despite there being some more work travel to do (spelled out by a plane and globe emoji) she hoped they all had a ‘good break’.

She followed the message with symbols of swimming, surfing, cocktail, sunshine, fishing and a goodbye wave.

Ms Bishop recently spent three hours replying to her 85,000 Twitter followers in nothing but emojis.

The Foreign Affairs Minister spent three hours entertaining her 85,000 Twitter followers by replying in nothing but emojis

Beginning just before 7pm on November 24, she replied to a Tweet that she was tagged in, with a digital icon of dancing girls. 

After a prompt from Fairfax journalist Ben Cubby, who exclaimed that the Foreign Minister 'sure does love her emojis', there was simply no stopping Ms Bishop who replied with a single 'cool' caricature – a smiley face wearing a pair of sunglasses.

From there, the requests proceeded to roll in, pushing the Foreign Affairs Minister to see just how far she'd take the joke.

'Fully expecting @JulieBishopMP to deliver her next address to the united nations entirely in emoji,' kimjongeuan wrote, to which Ms Bishop swiftly replied with a row of emojis including a plane, the statue of liberty and a speaking face.

Lycanzayn then tried their luck, asking '@JulieBishopMP send me an emoji story Julie please'.

Again, Ms Bishop replied with a row of pictures including a plane and a biscuit.

The jokes continued on until just after 11pm when the Foreign Minister, perhaps knackered from keeping up with today's youth, wrote 'iPhone has been wrested off me - no more (crying face) Time for (zzz emoji) good (moon) Twitter'.

The jokes continued on until just after 11pm when the Foreign Minister, clearly knackered from keeping up with today's youth, wrote the following Tweet 

The Tweets proved enough to win over one social media user, who replied 'I reckon you be a great prime minster, I hope you'll be in power one day'. 

Ms Bishop's emoji tirade was certainly not the strangest behaviour ever displayed by a politician over Twitter, however.

Earlier in the month, federal member for parliament Michael Danby stumped his social media followers by posting ten consecutive cat memes to his Twitter page with no captions or explanations.

While initially sparking rumours that his account had been hacked by a humourless Twitter troll, a spokesperson from his office soon revealed that the MP, who 'has a very keen and quirky sense of humour', was himself responsible for the stream of cat memes.
