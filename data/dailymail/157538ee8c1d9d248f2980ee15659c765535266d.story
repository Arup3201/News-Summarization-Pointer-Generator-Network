Behind bars: David Simpson could face the death penalty if convicted of murder after finding 18 mutilated bodies in the Central African Republic

A British man imprisoned in Africa after discovering 13 murdered bodies in a jungle was told he would be freed from prison if he made an £800,000 payment to local officials.

David Simpson, 24, was working for a safari firm in the Central African Republic when he found the site of the suspected massacre.

He reported it to the country’s military but just days later he was arrested on suspicion of murder – an accusation he vehemently denies.

It is widely believed supporters of the notorious warlord Joseph Kony perpetrated the killings.

Mr Simpson’s Swedish boss at the Cawa safari company, Erik Mararv, is also being held.

It is alleged the authorities are forcing him to pay money to fund the murder investigation. If he refuses to pay, he has been told they will all stay in prison longer.

It is also understood the relatives of the dead have been told by officials they will receive compensation payouts from Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv, 26, if they testify against the European men and claim they were the killers.

The father of one of the deceased has now come forward with a story claiming Mr Simpson employed a ‘magic man’ to place a curse on the victims’ food which drained the men’s strength – allowing the Briton and his colleagues to overpower them.

The relative has told a local newspaper he saw Mr Simpson standing over the bodies brandishing a blood-soaked machete.

Mr Simpson faces up to six months in jail as a judge carries out a review of the case following two ‘inconclusive’ investigations. Eleven local Cawa employees have also been imprisoned over the same crime.

Framed?: Mr Simpson worked for a big game hunting company and may have been set up by locals

The request for the £800,000 payment was made just days after Mr Simpson was arrested seven weeks ago.

A source said: ‘The official leading the investigation told Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv that if a “bail payment” of €1million [£800,000] was paid, their case would be resolved more quickly.

'But neither man’s family has anything close to that sort of wealth.’

The source added: ‘Mr Mararv has been asked to pay tens of thousands of pounds to cover the costs of the investigations since he was arrested.’

Mr Simpson, from Gillamoor, near Pickering, North Yorkshire, is the manager and pilot for the firm, which charges hunters upwards of £40,000 to shoot big game such as leopard, lion and buffalo.

Wanted: It is widely believed supporters of the notorious warlord Joseph Kony carried out the killings

Mr Simpson says he discovered the mutilated bodies on March 22 when clearing a route through dense bush on the border of the company’s hunting reserve.

The corpses had been hacked at with machetes. The region has suffered a number of raids by Kony’s militia, the Lord’s Resistance Army, in the past year.

The guerrilla leader is on the International Criminal Court’s ‘most wanted’ list for crimes against humanity.

The massacre victims are believed to have been gold-diggers who were employed by local officials from the nearby village  of Bakuma.

The source described how the bereaved relatives sought compensation from the local bureaucrats at a meeting held in the village last week.

‘The relatives wanted compensation because the officials had sent the victims to work in such a dangerous area,’ the source said.

‘But they were told they would not receive any payouts unless Mr Mararv and his colleagues were found guilty.

'This led to the relatives voting on whether to pin the murder on Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv. The majority voted to frame the men.’

The Simpson family is due to meet Foreign Office officials to discuss the case tomorrow. Central African Republic’s authorities were not available for comment.
