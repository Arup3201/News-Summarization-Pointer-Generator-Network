He may be more used to being whisked across town in an armoured limousine - flanked by jeeps laden with security.

But Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has proven he is just like the rest of us - by taking a lift to Tbilisi airport in a modest urban hatchback, with just his wife as his protection.

Mr Saakashvili drove the car - his own personal vehicle - to the airport ahead of an official visit to neighbouring Azerbaijan, to prove a political point amid criticism over his opulent lifestyle.

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has been filmed driving himself to the airport ahead of a state visit with only his Dutch-born wife, Sandra Roelofs, for security

The Georgian President’s PR team filmed Mr 
Saakashvili and his wife climbing into the car in the palace garage and followed them as they drive unaccompanied out on to the streets of Tbilisi before
heading for the airport.

The video then shows him slowing down 
as he gets stuck in traffic and waiting patiently at a red light.

The press team have since shared the video on YouTube.

Previously, Mr Saakashvili  - who has in the past come under fire for his extravagant lifestyle - travelled in an 
armoured Mercedes limousine accompanied by Jeeps filled with armed security.

He is filmed taking the tiny blue electric car from the palace garage, and then driving himself and the First Lady to the Tbilisi airport for an official trip to Baku

Mr Saakashvili’s United 
National Movement lost parliamentary elections last autumn to a 
coalition led by Bidzina Ivanishvili, now 
Prime Minister.  

Georgia has been in political limbo since, and although Mr Saakashvili remains President until October, the opposition have called for him to step down and relinquish power, the Independent reports.

He was stopped recently from giving an address in parliament.

Later, violence erupted outside the National Library where he tried to give the speech again.

It is believed the president was using the video to deflect criticism of his opulent lifestyle which saw him build a palace in Tbilisi and purchase two jets for official use, one of which has already been taken away from him.

The new government has accused him of unacceptable extravagance

Mr Saakashvili was the subject of an assassination attempt in 2005.

He now claims 
that he travels completely without security.  He said that if anything
 happened, 'his wife is there to protect him'.
