Police believe that Szarek could have died as early as December 8.

Szarek's family home is Grosse Point Woods went through tax foreclosure in 2010 and Szarek had been living on the streets ever since.

'It was a sad situation,' said Szarek’s cousin, Debra Hunkins of Mayville, to The Detroit Free Press.

'He was a ... person who contributed to society. ... He was almost, like, ahead of his time, very personable, liked to dance. Then it was just totally different.'

As soon as the story about Szarek circulated the media, family members, friends, and genealogists contacted investigators to gain whatever information they could.

'How nice of people to do that. It kind of restores your faith in people,' St. Clair Shores Police Detective Margaret Eidt said.

An 
investigation found that the Grosse Point Library had contact with 
Szarek in October when he was forced to leave because he was eating in 
the library and bathing in the bathroom.

Szarek
 would stay in the library and would also make money to survive by returning bottles to Kroger stores at Marter and 
Jefferson and 9 Mile and Mack both in the St. Clair Shores.

Eidt said that sometimes Szarek would get a donation of war, food and clothing from people who knew him.

Eidt
 told the Detroit Free Press that a resident at the Shore Club 
apartments near the boat ramp that he often had a backpack which police 
did not find.

Szarek was found with $146 in his wallet, he had $20 in bottle returns and also had seven Mega Millions lottery tickets.

The toilet was filled with trash and receipts dating back to December 8 when police think Szarek may Have died.

Szarek was discovered wearing a plaid green shirt, a hooded sweatshirt, a black windbreaker,a gray T-shirt, a pair of socks, boots, a hat, and mittens.

Szarek slept in a black garbage bag.

Szarek's cousin Debra Hunkins said that Szarek was never married and never had any children.

'For whatever reason, he was bypassed (for the promotion),' said Hunkins, who contacted police after hearing about her cousin’s death.

'When it happened, it caused some type of breakdown.'

Hunkin said her cousin was on track to become a  CEO of a company someday. She described him as 'intelligent.'

After Szarek lost his house family members say they had no way of getting in touch with him.

Szarek sent his aunt a Christmas card every year but after his aunt died five years ago, they 'had no way of knowing where he was or is he was alive.'

Hunkins said that Szarek 'became a stranger to most of the family.'

Szarek's brother in law Wayne Dulong said Szarek cared for his mother after his father died but once his mother died he split from his sister and Dulong never saw him again.

Dulong sad that he believed Szarek had a mental illness and said that letters sent to Szarek's residence were all returned.

'It makes you sad,' Hunkins said. 'How do you connect with people like that when he couldn’t connect with his own (family). … We don’t know what he was thinking. We don’t understand.'The portable toilet where Szarek's decomposing body was discovered has been removed from the boat launch, cleaned, and secured with tape.
