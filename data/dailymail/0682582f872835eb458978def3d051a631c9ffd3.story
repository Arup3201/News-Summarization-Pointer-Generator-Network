Ariel Castro padlocked the doors leading to his basement, his attic and his garage and never allowed his family inside, his son has exclusively revealed to MailOnline.

Chilling photographs from 2001 show a grinning Castro, who is accused of holding three women captive for a decade, standing in front of a locked door - behind which unimaginable horrors would allegedly later unfold in the basement.

In an interview with MailOnline, his son Anthony Castro, 31, has spoken of his shock at his father's alleged crimes and revealed how Ariel Castro asked him just weeks ago whether he believed the kidnapping of Amanda Berry - one of his victims - would ever be solved.

'If
 it's true that he took her captive and forced her into having sex with 
him and having his child and keeping her hidden and keeping them from 
sunlight, he really took those girls' lives,' he said.

'He
 doesn't deserve to have his own life anymore. He deserves to be behind 
bars for the rest of her life. I'm just thankful they're alive.'

Among his infrequent contact with his
 father, who separated from his mother in the 1990s, one recent 
conversation particularly stands out in Anthony's mind.

In mid-April, he says, his father 
asked him whether he thought police would ever find Amanda Berry, who 
escaped the Cleveland home on Monday afternoon.

When Anthony said he thought Berry was likely dead because she had been 
missing so long, Ariel responded: 'Really? You think so?'

At that time, according to police, Berry was locked in the basement of his father's home.

'The
 house was always locked,' remembered Anthony, who appeared visibly 
tired but reacted with poise throughout the interview. 'There were 
places we could never go. There were locks on the 
basement. Locks on the attic. Locks on the garage.'

Ariel Castro, 52, was arrested with his two brothers, 54-year-old Pedro and 50-year-old Onil after Berry, now 26, dramatically escaped from the house on Monday, a decade after she vanished.

Berry was rescued from the home, 
along with 23-year-old Gina DeJesus, who disappeared in April 2004 at 
age 14, and 32-year-old Michele Knight, who vanished in 2000 when she 
was 20.

The women and a six-year-old girl who was born to Berry while she was in captivity were whisked away to hospital. They have now been released and are in a safe location, authorities said.

Details have started to emerge of the horrors they experienced in the house, with authorities reportedly discovering chains and tape to restrain the girls inside the home.

Police sources also told NewsChannel5 that there were multiple pregnancies among the three women but that they suffered miscarriages after they were beaten or because they were so malnourished.

The Castros' close links to the long-running investigation have also emerged. Pedro Castro told a TV crew last July that a police forensic excavation being conducted in the neighborhood for Berry's body was 'a waste of time'.

Shock: Anthony Castro has said he is horrified at news his father, Ariel Castro, allegedly kidnapped three girls and held them captive at his home for a decade. Anthony's uncles have also been arrested

Missed: Anthony said his mother moved them from Castro's home following years of abuse

Speaking to MailOnline on Tuesday, Anthony Castro,
 a banker who lives in Columbus, Ohio, depicted his father as a violent,
 controlling man who nearly beat his mother to death in 1993 while she 
was recovering from brain surgery.

'Abused': Anthony said his father beat his mother, Nilda Figueroa, who passed away last year

Speaking to MailOnline from his 
apartment, which is dotted with numerous family pictures, Anthony said 
his father was secretive and barred him from entering certain rooms when
 he wasn’t around.

Anthony said he last visited his father’s home two weeks ago, though he was not invited inside. He said he never suspected that his father could be keeping three women captive in the basement.

'The only thing I can express is a 
tremendous level of shock,' he said. 'To those girls, it's beyond 
comprehension what happened to them. It's just a nightmare. I just feel 
so horrible for them. Unspeakably horrible.'

Ariel's ex-wife Grimilda 'Nilda' 
Figueroa - Anthony's mother – moved Mr Castro and his three sisters out 
of Ariel’s house in 1996 after years of violent abuse.

Anthony said he now speaks with his father just a few times a year – and seldom visits his house.

'I haven't been at that house for longer
 than 20 minutes for longer than I can remember,' he said. 'And we’re 
talking since high school. Late 90s.'

Anthony said neither he nor his three sisters have had much of a relationship with Ariel Castro.

'Having that relationship with my dad
 all these years when we lived in a house where there was domestic 
violence and I was beaten as well... we never were 
really close because of that and it was also something we never really 
talked about,' he said.

Hurt: Anthony has spoken with family members and they all believe his father is capable of the crimes

'It’s astonishing to even think about
 that I was so close to that. That I was physically at the house two 
weeks ago while that was going on, it's a lot to grasp.'

Anthony said he has spoken with 
several members of his family since his father and 
uncles were arrested. After getting over the initial shock of the 
horrendous allegations, they all have accepted that Ariel was likely 
capable of holding the three women against their will

'They're all furious. They're livid,' he said.

Anthony
 said he has no idea what role his uncles could have played in the 
ordeal. However, he says he doesn't yet believe that the three women 
were kept at Ariel's house for the entire 10 years.

He
 speculated that his uncle Onil, who also owns his house and lives 
alone, might have been involved in keeping the women in captivity.

Brother: Pedro Castro, 54

Arrest: Onil Castro, 50

Mother: Lillian Rodriguez (pictured center), the mother of the Castro brothers, returns to her home in Cleveland, Ohio after being questioned by police on Tuesday

Onil had two sons with a former live-in 
girlfriend of 15 years. The sons are now in their 20s, though Onil split 
with their mother about 10 years ago. He now lives alone.

'Part of me can believe he had something to do with it,' Anthony said of his uncle. 'Part of me can’t believe that it's something of this magnitude.

'My dad's brothers were the two closest 
people to him. My dad’s a really private person. If anybody knew what he
 was doing it would be those two.

'My dad is the most – he is the 
strongest and most able-bodied about of them. My two uncles are frail. 
They’ve drunk themselves into terrible health.'

Both men were alcoholics for many years, Anthony said, but Onil has since sobered up.

'When I was a kid, he was always drunk. Both of them, my uncles were always drunk,' he said.

His
 uncle Pedro, who lived with the mother of the brothers, has been so 
badly impacted by alcoholism that it's hard to even carry on a 
conversation with him, he said.

Pedro, he said, seemed content just living with his mother.

'Every time I went to visit my grandmother, he always just seemed be lying on his bed, watching TV. He was there every time.'

Amanda Berry disappeared in 2003 just
 a day before he 17th birthday. Her disappearance shocked her 
neighborhood in the west side of Cleveland

After
 the disappearance of Gina DeJesus in April 2004, Anthony Castro penned a
 piece for his local paper which included quotes from her mother.

He was a journalism student at Bowling Green State University when he wrote the article, entitled 'Gina DeJesus’ disappearance has changed her neighborhood', for the Plain Press in June of that year.

Gina's mother Nancy Ruiz told him: 'You can tell the difference. People are watching out for each other’s kids. It’s a shame that a tragedy had to happen for me to really know my neighbors.

'Bless their hearts, they’ve been great. People are really looking out for my daughter.'
