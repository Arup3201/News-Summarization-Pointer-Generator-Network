The banker who inspired a character in Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street put his nightclub-inspired Tribeca townhouse on the market last Tuesday for $43.5million.

Alan Wilzig, heir to his father's banking franchise, told the New York Post he paid $3,435,000 for 'an empty concrete box' that he and his wife Karin decorated.

After $1.5million in renovations, the condo now features a fitness center, sauna, a full roof deck, as well as bulletproof windows and a lighting system for those that feel at home in a nightclub.

Home: Alan Wilzig, a former banker, snapped up this townhome in 2005 before adding several customized design touches

The townhouse also had an attached garage that lets Wilzig zip in and out on his impressive collective of motorcycles. 

Though interior space is going for a whopping $5,800 per square foot, the most surprising aspect may be that Wilzig is trying to sell the townhouse without a broker by posting ads to Zillow and Facebook.

'Feel free to share this with your luxury real-estate friends for anyone interested in a Manhattan super-residence,' the post from October 7 says.  

Nightclub: Wilzig said he wanted to replicate the feel of a nightclub, adding a Crestron system that automates a 64-color lighting system

Mood: Lighting in the bedroom can be adjusted like the rest of the house, letter the owner choose among 64 colors

Designs: Wilzig and his wife Karin design most of the home themselves, adding design touches like alligator-wrapped handrails

Kick: The home is accessorized with several pieces from Wilzig's  collection of bikes and motorcycle memorobilia

Douglas Elliman broker Toni Haber told The Real Deal that Wilzig's price might be 'optimistic for what it is,' as the townhouse was completed with several design touches that might not fit everyone's taste.

Rounding out the 7,500 square feet are alligator-wrapped banisters and a 14-foot fish tank equipped with lights that make it glow in neon colors, just like the rest of the house.

'When we set this up, I was still planning on lots of entertaining and making the house something like a nightclub,' Wilzig told the Post, though having his two children changed that.

Super-dork: Wilzig complained on Facebook that Scorsese made his character look dorky next to the Wolf, Jordan Belfort, and said he wished the movie featured him driving his Ferrari Testarossa

Then and now: Wilzig put up the photo of himself with the future Mrs Belfort, claiming he went with her as 'friendly exes' to Belfort's on the night she and the real Wolf of Wall Street met, while asking for a Facebook friend to snap a photo of the scene for him

'The reality is, we moved in here and a month later Siggi was born. So, the first time we turned the color on was to turn the house’s façade baby blue in honor of his birth. And, later, we did it in pink for Winni.'

Wilzig earned much of his wealth through the Trust Company of New Jersey, a banking franchise he inherited from his father that was then acquired by North Fork Bank Corporation for over $700million in 2003.

Notably, Wilzig dated Jordan Belfort's future second wife, Nadine Caridi and went with her as 'friendly exes' to the party where she first met Belfort.

Under the hood: The built-in garage gives Wilzig space for his large collection of automobiles and motorcycles

Kids: Wilzig and his wife moved in just before their first child, Siggi, was born, but the six bedroom home gave them plenty of room for growth when Winni was born later

Baked: The home includes a fitness center and spa, with a tanning bed to get you ready for a Jordan Belfort-style party in the Hamptons

The encounter is dramatized in the movie The Wolf of Wall Street, where Belfort flirts with Nadine (named Naomi in the film) in front of Wilzig's character.

In an epic Facebook post, Wilzig attacked the movie, saying the creators 'made me a super-dork' and complained Scorsese didn't show him driving the red Ferrari Testarossa he owned at the time.

Wilzig said and his family will be spending more time in their home upstate, which features a professional-grade racetrack, and hopes to find a smaller home in Manhattan if the condo sells.

'It’s time to let some hedge-fund guy who makes $40M every 6 months have it…or some Russian billionaire,' he said. 

Entertain: With the $43.5million condo, hosts can treat guests to a movie in the home entertainment center and customize the lighting 

Designs: Wilzig and his wife Karin design most of the home themselves, adding design touches like rare blue quartz countertops in the kitchen

Toned: The home includes a fitness center and spa, with exercise machines to tone up for a Hamptons pool party

Under the hood: The built-in garage gives Wilzig space for his large collection of automobiles and motorcycles

Open air: The home has both a roof deck and an outdoor patio for soaking up what sun can filter through the surrounding high-rises

He inspired the character Blair Hollingsworth in The Wolf of Wall Street, but in real life, he chafed at his depiction as a 'super-dork' without a cool car
