A British tourist who had become 'infatuated' with Thailand plunged 300ft to his death in a mystery fall from a 36th-floor apartment. 

Detectives are investigating how John Knotts, of Blaydon in Gateshead, came to fall from the Sky Beach Condominium in North Pattaya.

John Westgarth, a friend of Mr Knotts, revealed how the 49-year-old loved Thailand so much he had become 'addicted' and would go several times a year. This time he had gone to the country to see a girlfriend he had met previously and had emailed to say he had missed his flight home.

John Knotts (right) plunged 36 storeys to his death from an apartment block in Thailand, just a day after his friend John Westgarth (left) had sent him an email warning he faced a 'very big fall' because of his lifestyle 

Mr Westgarth responded by email and told his friend about the dangers of his lifestyle and warned him he was 'heading for a big fall.'

A day later he was told Mr Knotts had died. 

Thai newspapers reported that Mr Knotts had been to a Chinese New Year Party with his girlfriend Khun Kullaya, 47, before he fell from the apartment.

Mr Knotts first went on holiday to Thailand ten years ago and despite being on benefits would visit up to five times a year. 

He went to Thailand on January 7 to see his girlfriend and the couple had planned a trip to Bangkok to get her a visa.

Mr Knotts was only supposed to be away for 28 days and was due back on February 3, but missed his flight and never returned.

'I was on holiday in Kenya and I emailed him saying it was nearly home time for him,' said Mr Westgarth, 64. 

'I never got a reply. I then texted him something similar and never got a reply.

'I then sent him another email saying 'have you missed your flight again?'

'He emailed me back saying "yeah, I've done it again. I've missed my flight".'

Mr Westgarth said everything started to go wrong with his friend since he developed an obsession with Thailand. 

He added: 'He was a likeable character. Since he started to go to Thailand, everything centred around the country.

'It was worse than heroin. He wouldn't admit to being addicted but he was addicted to the place.

'He was 10 days over his visa.

'He lost all interest in England. He was there and he didn't want to be anywhere else.'

Mr Westgarth said his friend had one or two relationships during his visits to Thailand over the 10 years and was 'looking to fall in love.' 

Mr Knotts died at around 10pm on February 18. 

Local newspaper Pattaya One reported that his girlfriend had suffered facial injuries and he was in financial difficulty, with his home in Newcastle about to be repossessed.  

Detectives are continuing to investigate the circumstances of Mr Knotts' death.
