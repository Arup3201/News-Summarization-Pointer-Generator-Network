World champion Tony Martin claimed the opening stage time trial of the Tour de Suisse on Saturday, with Sir Bradley Wiggins coming home over half a minute adrift of the German.

Omega Pharma-QuickStep rider Martin, who finished second behind Wiggins in the men's individual time trial at the 2012 London Olympics, completed the 9.4-kilometre course in Bellinzona in a time of 13 minutes and 48 seconds to take the early lead in the event.

Martin's time was six seconds clear of nearest challenge Tom Dumoulin and 13 better off than Rohan Dennis in third.

Local favourite and 2009 Tour de Suisse winner Fabian Cancella was fourth, three seconds further back, while Team Sky's Wiggins finished down in 14th spot, 32 seconds behind Martin and three adrift of his team-mate Peter Kennaugh.

Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France champion, was back in the saddle after winning the Tour of California last month.

Two-time defending champion Rui Alberto Faria Da Costa of Portugal was 28th after the opening stage, 42 seconds off top spot.
