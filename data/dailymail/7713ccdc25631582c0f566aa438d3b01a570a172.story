A teenager mother who gave her baby daughter up for adoption in Alaska due to her 'lack of life experience' is still pumping and sending breast milk to the infant, it has emerged.

Kaleena Pysher, 19, who lives in Anchorage, was in her senior year in high school when she discovered she was pregnant with her daughter, Raylie, last February.

She quickly opted for adoption after deciding it would be 'selfish' for her to bring up the child in her young and 'inexperienced' position. At just four months' pregnant, she settled on an adoptive family.

After Raylie was born last November, the baby's adoptive parents - who wish to remain anonymous - took her home after thanking Kaleena for her 'selfless' decision to 'give them the gift of life'.

However, the teenager's input in her daughter's upbringing did not stop there. After hearing about the benefits of breast milk over formula, Kaleena knew she had to try breastfeeding for Raylie's sake.

Now, she has been pumping and sending breast milk to her daughter's adoptive parents - whose location has not been disclosed - for nearly three months, despite it causing her pain.

'I'm doing this all out of love. Because I want the best thing for my daughter,' Kaleena, whose nipples often crack, bleed and scab over during the pumping, told the Alaska Dispatch News. 

The teenager, who is now training to become a dental assistant, discovered she was pregnant during a routine visit to the doctor. She was so shocked she took two home pregnancy tests to confirm it.

In subsequent weeks, Kaleena, who was living with her parents in West Anchorage, decided to give her baby up for adoption. At 18, she felt she lacked the life experience needed to raise a child.

'When I first found out that I was pregnant, I knew I didn’t have the life experience to raise a baby, and I wasn’t going to be selfish… So, I decided for adoption,' she said.

She also did not want to rely on her parents for help, nor go on welfare, the newspaper reported. 

So, she set about finding an adoptive family that she could trust to care for her daughter, before agreeing to an open adoption, which would allow her to play a role in the child's life.

During her pregnancy, Kaleena said she 'bonded' with her baby. She also talked with the adoptive parents daily, sent ultrasound photos, and kept them up-to-date on the fetus's condition.

'I would tell them, "Oh, she has the hiccups today", or, "She's moving around a lot today",' she said.

When she was seven months' pregnant, Kaleena spoke to a visiting nurse from the Southcentral Foundation’s Nutaqsiivik Nurse-Family Partnership program about breastfeeding.

She then told the adoptive family she wanted to breastfeed Raylie  in the hospital and for the first few months of her life due to the antibodies and brain growth that breast milk could offer her.

'When a baby is fed breast milk, they are just way ahead of the game. I decided that I wanted my baby to have the best options and to be able to grow,' she said.

When Kaleena gave birth nine days before her due date at the end of November, she held and breastfed her daughter. But when the adoptive parents arrived, she placed the baby in their arms.

After that, she didn't hold her daughter again until a week later - and even then, she just held her for several minutes. 'I wanted my daughter to bond with them. They are raising her,' she said.

Determined: Instead of going out with her friends, Kaleena (left, in a Facebook photo) would make sure she was at home so she could reattach herself to her breast pump every 120 minutes. Right, baby Raylie

Moving forward: Kaleena (pictured) is now weaning herself off the breast pump. But despite her breastfeeding having come to an end, she has been assured by the adoptive parents that she will still remain in Raylie's life

Over the next few weeks, Kaleena got into a routine of pumping breast milk for Raylie, who turned out to have a ferocious appetite. Every two hours, the teenager would pump the liquid and seal it in bags.

Instead of going out with her friends, she would make sure she was at home so she could reattach herself to her breast pump every 120 minutes, often while watching TV shows on Netflix.

Even when her breasts started to hurt, she plowed on. 'I just sucked it up and kept going,' she said.

Kaleena stored the bags containing her breast milk in a freezer, before shipping them to Raylie's adoptive parents in boxes marked 'Fresh Seafood - Keep Refrigerated' to ensure the milk was fresh.

The adoptive family paid for the shipping. Three months on, Kaleena has produced so much milk - at times, 6oz from each breast every two hours - that the parents have told her they have enough of it.

The teenager now plans to donate the extra milk she has in her freezer to a milk bank in Colorado, where it will be screened and fed to premature babies in a neonatal intensive care unit. 

Kaleena is currently weaning herself off the breast pump. But despite her breastfeeding having come to an end, she has been assured by the adoptive parents that she will still remain in Raylie's life.

'They have told me that we are a family now. They say that I will always be her mother, and that they are appreciative of the gift of life I have given them,' Kaleena told TODAY.
