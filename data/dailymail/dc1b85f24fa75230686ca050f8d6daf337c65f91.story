There’s a fine line between a well done burger and one that’s cremated.

And whether you are a fan of a gas barbeque or carefully stoking charcoal, it can be difficult to cook meat and other foods exactly to your liking all at the same time.

But soon dangerously chewy chicken and overly sizzled steaks could be a thing of the past as one company is launching a ‘smart grill’.

A good grilling: Californian company Lynx is currently developing a luxurious barbeque that is voice activated, so you can tell the machine what you want to cook and let it sort out the perfect way of grilling it

The grilling process begins with a couple of simple questions from the grill about what's to be cooked.

The barbeque connects to an online database to find the optimal grilling time and technique for the food and tells the chef where on the grill to place each item to ensure the best result.

This also means that all the food will be ready at the same time.

The grill can send notifications via audio, visual alerts, and an app.

For peace of mind, the grill shuts off if it does not hear instructions for 30 minutes.

Californian company Lynx is currently developing a luxurious voice activated barbeque, so a user could tell the machine what they want to cook and let it tell them the perfect way of grilling it.

When the Lynx Smart Grill launches next year it will connect to a home Wi-Fi network in order to access recipes and cooking times on a database that has been put together by ‘master grillers’.

For example, if you tell the grill you would like to cook a piece of chicken, it would automatically fire up the gas burners and instruct you where to place the meat for the best result, using an accompanying app.

Grillers will be able to keep tabs on the progress of their dinner using the app or receiving text messages. They could also choose voice prompts if they are nearby.

This means that if the weather is far from perfect, chefs can keep warm inside while the grill is cooking dinner, or if they are throwing a party, they could mingle with guests and be reminded when their food is ready.

While some people might worry leaving a barbeque unattended is dangerous, the smart grill will automatically switch off to prevent food from burning if a person misses their reminders, or if it has been inactive for 30 minutes.

There's an app for that: Hungry grillers will be able to keep tabs on the progress of their dinner using the app (illustrated) or receiving text messages. They could also choose voice prompts if they are nearby, freeing them up to mix with guests if they are having a party

The grill is currently only a prototype by the company, which is based in Downey, California and there is no indication as to how expensive it will be or if it will be available in the UK.

The company said: ‘As we move towards a production model next year, we expect the technology will cost a slight premium but our objective is to keep the price per unit of the production version well within the window of affordability for our customers.’
