An 18-year-old girl being held in quarantine in Queensland has tested negative for Ebola. 

Initial tests on the West African woman, after she showed possible symptoms of the disease, have given her the all clear.  

The unnamed teen has been held at the the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital since she developed a fever this weekend.

'Yes, they are negative,' a spokeswoman for Queensland Health told AAP on Monday. 

The woman arrived in Australia from Guinea about 12 days ago with eight members of her extended family.

Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young, pictured here in 2009, said the chance the woman has Ebola is low 

All of the family members were placed in home quarantine immediately after their arrival. 

In a press conference on Sunday evening, Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young assured Australians the risk of the teenager spreading Ebola - if she is infected - was very low. 

'She's been here in Brisbane for 11 days, there's no risk for anyone on that plane,' Dr Young said.

'You need to have symptoms and be excreting the virus, in vomit, in faeces, in sweat, in urine and she doesn't have any symptoms so she hasn't been excreting the virus so someone could get infected.' 

The health officer said Queensland had been aware of the family's arrival, and the woman, two other adults, and six children had not come into contact with anyone since being in Australia.

'There is no risk to the community at all because she (and the family) hasn't left the house or had any visitors,' Dr Young said.

Doctors received results of the patient's first Ebola test on Monday morning, but the woman cannot be completely cleared until a secondary test is completed in three days. Until then the patient must remain in isolation.

Thousands of people have already died from the virus in West African nations such as Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia 

'She's in a negative pressure room, with another room attached to it and all the staff going into that room will be wearing full personal protective gear,' Dr Young said. 

Despite this, the teenager is doing 'very well' and she and her family have been 'very responsible'.

'It's unlikely she has the disease as she doesn't remember coming into contact with anyone who had the disease,' Dr Young added.

'The most important thing is that although what is going on in West Africa is tragic circumstances ... the risk of getting Ebola here in Australia is extraordinarily low.'

This is the second scare this month after Cairns nurse Sue Ellen Kovack returned from Sierre Leone exhibiting symptoms.

She had been working as a volunteer treating patients but was later cleared of having the potentially deadly virus.
