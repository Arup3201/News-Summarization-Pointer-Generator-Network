He's been to some high places in his time, but now Snoop Dogg has turned even the White House green - by lighting a cannabis joint in the bathroom.

The rapper claimed he reassured Secret Service agents he would only be igniting a 'napkin' before having a luxurious solo smoke on a recent visit.

If his story is true he joins the likes of country singer Willie Nelson, who famously lit up a joint at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.

He knows people in high places: Rapper Snoop Dogg admits he lit up a joint in a White House bathroom

Confession: Taking a big puff on a joint, the rapper told his story to comedian Jimmy Kimmel (left)

And of course he ranks with the President himself - who has probably never lit up in the executive mansion, but was a heavy smoker as a young man.

When asked about his habit in 2006, Barack Obama famously replied: 'I inhaled frequently. That was the point.'

The confession was made on Snoop Dogg's GGN ('Double G News Network') Youtube show during an appearance by comedian and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.

Kimmel asked him: 'Have you ever smoked at the White House?'

Snoop replied: 'In the bathroom, not in the White house but in the bathroom.

Puff: Barack Obama (left in 1979) smoked heavily when he was younger and when asked whether he had inhaled in 2006, he famously replied: 'That was the point'. Snoop visited the White House in December (right)

'I said "May I use the bathroom for a second?". And they said "What are you going to do, a number one or number two?". I said number two.'

Kimmel laughed and asked: 'Who said this, the First Lady?'

Snoop replied: 'Nah, the CIA. Or the FBI. The alphabet boys.

'So I said look, when I do a number two I usually have a cigarette or light something to get the aroma right.

'And they said "You know what, you can light a piece of napkin" and I said "I'll do that".'

Taking an enormous puff on a marijuana joint, Snoop added: 'And the napkin was this'.

The 42-year-old rapper, real name Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, was at the White House in December for the Kennedy Center Honors.

He attended in a smart bow tie with 
other members of the music world to pay tribute to legends Billy Joel, 
Carlos Santana, Herbie Hancock, opera star Martina Arroyo and actress 
Shirley MacLaine.

Smoker: Snoop Dogg is famous for his music - but also for his self-confessed, widely publicised cannabis use

President Obama recently told the New Yorker magazine marijuana was no more harmful than alcohol.

He was speaking as the debate continues over the decriminalisation - and even full legalisation - of the drug in certain states, spinning off a range of products from cannabis massage oils to cannabis coffee.

'As has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid,' he said. 'And I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life.'

He added poorer sections of society including African Americans and Latinos were punished harsher for the same use than the middle classes.

Snoop's claim remains sadly unsubstantiated.
