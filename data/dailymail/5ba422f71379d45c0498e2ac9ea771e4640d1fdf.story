Harrowing recordings released today of 911 calls made from inside the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting reveal staff begging for help while dispatchers calmly assure them it's on the way.

In the tapes, dispatchers tell a panicked teacher to get away from the windows and urge another to apply pressure to a wound to her leg, while callers report hearing gunshots in the hallways outside.

Authorities released the tapes after much legal wrangling, with prosecutors arguing that 
making the calls public could be painful for victims' families. But a 
judge ruled last week that they could be released in order to 
review how law enforcement handled the incident.

As well as showing the dispatchers' calm response, the tapes reveal the chaos inside the Connecticut school on December 14.

'Something's going on, please!' a janitor pleads with dispatchers, telling them a glass window at the front of the school has shattered. 'I keep hearing shooting, I keep hearing popping!'

Response: Officials stand outside of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14 last year, after a gunman opened fire, killing 26. Recordings of the 911 calls were released today

A female teacher pleads for help as 
she protects her classroom filled with students - but warns dispatchers 
that the door to her room is not locked.

'It sounds like there are shots in the hallway,' she says, trying to keep her voice steady.

Another
woman wails: 'I think there's somebody shooting in here... Somebody's 
got a gun. I saw a glimpse of somebody running down the hallway. They're 
still shooting. Sandy Hook school - please!'

In the seven calls, the operators urge
those inside the school to take cover, lock the doors and keep away from the windows as they contact town officials 
and state police for help.

In another call, a dispatcher tells a member of the staff to apply pressure to a bullet wound to her leg.

The wounded teacher, who was shot in a hallway, seeks cover in a classroom, while the dispatcher asks, 'Are you okay right now?'Â 

'For now, hopefully,' the teacher responds.

One dispatcher can be heard telling a 
co-worker to get off the phone, contact state police immediately and 
send all the staff they can.

The operators also ask about the 
welfare of 
the children, repeatedly asking if they know of any injuries or the 
location of the children nearest to the school's front entrance.

Killer: Adam Lanza, 20, shot dead 20 children and six staff at the school before killing himself

The 
gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary 
School the morning of December 14 and gunned down 20 children and six 
educators with a semi-automatic rifle.

He
also killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, in their Newtown home before 
driving to the school, and he committed suicide as police arrived at the
scene.

The calls to Newtown police were posted on a town website on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, Newtown School Superintendent
John Reed emailed parents to alert them to the recordings' release and 
remind them the recordings could serve as an 'emotional trigger'.

The
release came after the Associated Press and other news organizations 
requested 911 calls and police reports - as is routine - on the day of 
the shooting.

But these requests were effectively 
ignored for months until AP appealed to the state's Freedom of 
Information Commission, which said in September that the recordings 
should be released.

The
prosecutor in charge of the investigation had argued that releasing the
tapes could prove painful to the victims' families, hurt the 
investigation, subject witnesses to harassment and violate the rights of
survivors who deserve special protection as victims of child abuse.

A lawyer for Newtown had also warned that gunfire is audible in the background of recordings.

A state judge dismissed those arguments last week and ordered the tapes be released Wednesday unless the state appealed.

'Release
of the audio recordings will also allow the public to consider and 
weigh what improvements, if any, should be made to law enforcement's 
response to such incidents,' New Britain Superior Court Judge Eliot 
Prescott said at the ruling.

'Delaying
the release of the audio recordings, particularly where the legal 
justification to keep them confidential is lacking, only serves to fuel 
speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement 
officials.'

Calls that were made from cellphones and routed to state police dispatchers are not among the tapes.

Those include calls from a woman who was injured in the foot and a parent who called from inside a conference room during the shooting, according to documents released last week by prosecutors.
