For TV and movie addicts, it could be the ultimate gadget.

A Kickstarter project is aiming to build a robotic projector that can move around the home, taking its TV picture and sound system with it.

The $1,900 robot, called Keecker, is controlled by an app.

The robot can roll between rooms and project onto any surface

It has a 1080p HD projector built in, as well as a 360 degree sound system.

Two wheels allow the robot, which the firm said is a 'home pod' to move around. 

It will also will have a mapping mode, where it defines where the rooms and walls in your house are, so you can press a button called 'living room' and have the robot wheel over on its own.

According to founder Pierre Lebeau, Keecker is hoping to ship its robots in six to eight months.

'We all love the experience of the big screen and great sound in out living room, but elsewhere the experience is just not the same,' he said.

The robot can even roll outside and project onto walls

It has a 'short throw' projector so it can still create an image even when close to the surface

The Keecker also acts as a 360 speaker to play music

'This is why we created Keecker.

'It's a totally new type of computer, we call it a home pod.'

Keecker projects any content anywhere you want, it can turn any surface into a screen.

'Keecker is creating something new - imagine your kids going to sleep with the milky way on the ceiling, or waking up to the maldives,' said Lebeau.

It's makers say it will also work as a remote security camera, and will even allow them to check on their pets.

How it works: The Keecker has a fully functioning Android computer on board

The robot can also project web pages onto any surface

'When you're away, you can video chat and see what goes on at home

'Check your pets and talk to them, ensure your house is safe, see if you forgot to lock the window and project yourself back at home from anywhere for live conversations.' 

The Keecker is a fully functioning Android computer, and can run apps downloaded from the Google Play Store. 

An app is used to control the gadget and summon it to every room.
