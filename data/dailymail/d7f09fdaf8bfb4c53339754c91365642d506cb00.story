Casey Veal, pictured here with her baby Zayden, said she wants her son's legacy to be one of happiness

Nearly two years ago to the day, Casey Veal lost her  baby when a drug-crazed intruder broke into her home and beat her 10-month-old boy Zayden Veal-Whitting to death.

On June 15, 2012, Zayden was killed in a senseless and unprovoked attack, bludgeoned over the head with a homemade baton more than 25 times.

The man found guilty of the brutal killing, Harley Hicks, was 19 and high on the drug ice at the time. He is due to be sentenced on Friday.

Hicks was on a drug-fueled crime spree which included a series of other break-ins on that night night in Bendigo, Victoria.

Despite maintaining his innocence over the murder of Zayden, the Crown has called for a life sentence for Hicks.

Casey told the MailOnline she knew the killer in high school, but had no connection with him since, nor at the time of her son’s murder.

During a plea hearing in the Supreme Court in Bendigo, Crown prosecutor Michele Williams described the attack as 'an evil killing without any real, rational explanation'.

'This killing falls within the worst case category of murders and as such we call for a life sentence,' Ms Williams said.

News of this brutal and unprovoked attack shocked not only the community in Bendigo, but people all around Australia.

But Casey insists she doesn’t want people to remember her second-born boy as the baby who was beaten to death.

After Zayden's (right) death, Casey had her older son Xavier (left) removed from her care for four months

‘I want everyone to remember him as Zayden, as the little boy that was really happy and that was taken too soon.

‘Instead of “the murdered baby” or “the bludgeoned baby”…we know he died traumatically beyond what words can express. Even I can’t express that and I’ve seen it, it’s beyond horrible but I don’t want people to remember him as that.’

A court heard that Hicks broke into Casey's house as part of a string of burglaries, and unplugged the baby monitor before he struck Zayden, his possible motive said to be to silence the baby.

When Casey awoke the next morning her eldest son Xavier let her know all the doors were open in the house, and they soon discovered they'd been robbed as wallets and other belongings were missing, with their car also broken into.

It was then Casey discovered her youngest child, bruised and covered in blood, beaten almost beyond recognition.

There was 'blood everywhere' and 'his face was swollen and bruised, he was unresponsive,' she said in court according to the Bendigo Advertiser.

The murder weapon was later discovered with both Hick's and Zayden's DNA on it, at Hick's property.

Casey, 24, now wants her child’s legacy to be a positive one, and she is trying to combat the stigma and the silence of parents who have their children taken from them too soon.

‘I want it to be at a point where it’s not weird or taboo anymore, where it’s just normal,’ she told the MailOnline.

‘For them to speak their names and feel freely enough to do that… they can talk about them and whenever they’re comfortable they can tell the story of their child.’

Xavier, now nearly five, is Casey’s eldest child and was taken away from his mother by the Department of Human Services (DHS) almost immediately after his little brother’s death.

‘I didn’t know what to do, because I’d had at least one child since I was 19 and I’d always had someone to look after and then it was just me again at 22,’ Casey said.'

In a harrowing piece Casey penned herself published on Mamamia, the 24-year-old described in heartbreaking detail how her life has dramatically altered since the murder of her young son.

'A nightmare I never woke from again. I awoke to find my son, my world, my mini me, stolen…'

She has also spoken of of Xavier’s trust issues since the death of his brother, and claims the way her family was treated by the DHS still affects her relationship with her eldest son.

‘They were very inconsiderate, compassionless; they had no empathy at all. They had no information bar what they had read in the newspaper, which wasn’t accurate at times to start with.

'I think he [Xavier] suffered the most, he’s very similar to me I think, he thinks a lot, he expresses passion and he’s very empathetic.

Casey says if Zayden (left) hadn't been killed it could have been Xavier (right), and she has to let go of the what-ifs

Supervised visits were the only way Casey was able to see Xavier for months, as she had to be cleared of Zayden’s murder before her first son was returned.

She struggled daily without either of her sons by her side, and claimed the DHS were misinformed and acted insensitively during some of her darkest days.

Casey said she was blindsided by officials from the service who turned up at her house the same day of the murder and tried to ban her from seeing her older son Xavier at all for the days following.

‘They tried to make it from the day Zayden died [Friday], all that weekend and the Monday that I wasn’t allowed to have any contact with my son [Xavier] at all.

‘In the long run they made sure I wasn’t a drug dealer after I’d already been cleared by the police and the police charged Harley. [Then] once they cleared me and made sure I’m okay and I can parent they gave me a half-arsed sorry and gave him back. After putting me through an emotional hell for months.’

Since the attack Casey has struggled with crippling anxiety, depression and struggles in social situations.

Casey and her family were due to move out of their home the day after Zayden was murdered, and most of the house was already packed into boxes.

But she said she can’t let the thoughts of what could have happened rule her life.

Casey hopes that speaking out about the loss of Zayden will encourage other parents to share their experiences

‘I can think about what-ifs until I am 100, easily, the biggest one is what if I put Zayden in with me that night cause he was sick, like I used to, and I thought no I don’t want to break the sleeping cycle.

‘The constant thought of that was what if he had hurt Xavier? Would he have hurt my older son?

‘If I take one out of the equation, it could mean it takes another one, it could have been me instead or it could have been my partner at the time instead,’ she said.

‘I for a long time blamed myself for it, and no matter which way I went I can’t find any answers for any where it’s my fault.’

One of the hardest times of the year for Casey and Xavier can be around Christmas, when all Xavier wishes for is his little brother to come home.

‘He’ll ask for a toy or a balloon to give to Zayden, or he’ll ask for his brother to come back. I think he understands he can’t come back but he thinks if he just keeps crying it might work just once,’ Casey said.

Other days can be just as hard, and Casey shared a heartbreaking anecdote of the struggles her older son, who was just three when he lost his baby brother, still faces.

Xavier (left) has been the most affected by his brother's death, and his mum Casey (right) says on Christmas his only wish is for Zayden to come home

‘Some days he will cry for no reason…he just goes to his room and he’ll be very quiet for a time and I’ll ask “what are you doing little buddy?” and I’ll go in there and he has his little head in his hands and he just cries.

‘He’s only five in a couple of weeks and some days you would just think he’s an adult. He’s been through so much in such a short amount of time, he’s really resilient and I couldn’t be prouder of him, but he does say so many adult things and he’s looked after me, which he never should have had to do, ever.'

Despite the unimaginable hardship Casey and her family have faced over the past two years, she's doing her best to keep moving forward with her life.

She is living with a new partner, and works in the centre of town, though sometimes finds it hard when she is recognised.

The mother now looks at the death of her child almost philosophically, refusing to hide her grief and insisting on speaking out about Zayden.

‘I think he was sent to me for a reason, so I try to speak out as much as I can about child loss so that it doesn’t stay hidden anymore and it’s not shameful to speak out.

‘I like to think he chose me for a reason and he knew it’d be short and horrible but that I could handle it, and that he watches over me every day.

'I like to think that one day I will see him again but until then he’ll watch over and help me going where I’m going, and that gives me that little bit of hope.’

The boy's mother said she believes the loss of Zayden (left), pictured here was big brother Xavier was for a reason and he now watches over her
