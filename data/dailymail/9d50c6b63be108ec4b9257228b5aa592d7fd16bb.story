A devoted couple who died within days of each other after 60 years of marriage will be laid to rest holding hands  in a double coffin.

Veteran Victor Bower, 82, lost his battle with blood cancer on February 8. Just nine days later, his beloved wife, Elsie, 82, died in hospital after suffering from a number of medical problems.

The childhood sweethearts, who were married in March 1954, will be buried together on Monday.

Sweethearts: The couple, pictured on their wedding day in March 1954, met in Sheffield as teenagers

Devoted: Victor and Elsie Bower, who died within just nine days of each other after 60 years of marriage

Lasting love: Mr and Mrs Bower will be laid to rest together holding hands in this double coffin

Their daughter Sharon Bower, 54, said the couple met as teenagers and would not have wanted to be parted.

She said: 'They were always together. They used to cry a lot if they ever had to spend time apart. Although my mum had medical problems, it was a broken heart that she died from.

'We knew she was going to die, it was just a case of when because she said to us: "I'm sorry for leaving you all".

'They lived together and died together, so it was only right they went together too. I want them to go together holding hands.'

Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren

The couple had two children, Sharon and Susan, nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 

Mr Bower served as a gunman in Yorkshire and Lancashire Regiment before working in telecommunications in Sheffield and later as a plasterer for the city council.

Mrs Bower worked in inspection at a number of cutlery factories.

The couple lived in Sheffield before moving to Chesterfield, Derbyshire with their young family. They later returned to Sheffield, where they lived for more than 30 years.

After retiring they enjoyed spending almost every weekend in their caravan at Saltfleet, Lincolnshire.

Mr Bower was diagnosed with cancer in 2009 and had gone into remission, only for it to return last year. He died at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, on February 8.

His wife had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was suffering from pneumonia when she died at the city's Northern General Hospital on February 17.

Sharon said: 'They were really close and always together. Mum was in a wheelchair and on oxygen and because of that she never got to see him in hospital which upset her.

'We were going to try and get her down, but he died the night before.'

Sheffield funeral director Michael Fogg, said was happy to help the family with their request for the couple to be buried together. 

Mr Fogg said: 'We were already looking after Victor's funeral, so it wasn't until the night I was arranging it that Sharon told me Elsie had passed away.

'I thought what can I do as a funeral director to support a couple that even death couldn't keep apart.

'To me it didn't seem right to have separate coffins when all Elsie wanted to be was by the side of Victor. It is the first time a double coffin has been used in South Yorkshire.'
