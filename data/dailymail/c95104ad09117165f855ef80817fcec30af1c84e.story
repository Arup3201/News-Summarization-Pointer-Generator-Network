Starz CEO Chris Albrecht has married his 25-year-old fianc√©e Montana Coady in a ceremony at the All Saints' Episcopal Church in New York.

The 59-year-old former boss of HBO later partied at the Beverly Hills Hotel with a host of famous names, including Harvey Weinstein, Larry David, Billy Crystal and Chris Rock.

Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, who was president of the company when Mr Albrecht was forced to leave in 2007, was a groomsman at the wedding, the New York Post reported.

Mr Albrecht resigned from HBO, which produced hit shows The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Six Feet Under during his tenure, after being arrested for allegedly strangling his then girlfriend in Las Vegas parking lot following a boxing match.

At Saturday's wedding, the bride wore a custom-designed wedding dress from Monique Lhuillier, with a train, and a Marchesa after-party dress, the New York Post reported.

The bridesmaids were fitted in strapless crimson gowns.

'Guests said they'd never seen Chris look so happy,' a source told the New York Post.

Oscar-winning producer Brian Grazer and mogul Steve Bing were also groomsmen.

Among the 150 at the party were best man, producer Geyer Kosinski, director Brett Ratner, Paramount's Brad Grey, Nikki Haskell, Karolina Kurkova, CBS' Les Moonves and wife Julie Chen.

The couple were engaged in May 2010, when Mr Albrecht gave her a 7.5-carat diamond ring.

Despite the 24-year age gap, he told GQ at the time: 'I feel totally and completely in love.'

In May 2007, Time Warner announced that Mr Albrecht had agreed to resign at the company's request, three days after he was arrested and charged with assaulting girlfriend Karla Jensen in a Las Vegas parking lot.

Mr Albrecht's resignation came a day after he took a leave of absence, announcing he was an alcoholic and that the incident in Las Vegas was a result of a lapse in his sobriety.

At the time the LA Times reported that in 1991, HBO paid a settlement of at least $400,000 to a subordinate of Mr Albrecht who had accused him of choking her during a confrontation in her office.

The newspaper said that the woman, Sasha Emerson, had been romantically involved with Mr Albrecht, and that the payment had been made in connection with her departure from the cable channel.
