Mansfield manager Paul Cox has left the struggling League Two club by mutual consent.

The Stags are languishing in 19th spot after nine games without a win and were held 1-1 by FA Cup minnows Concord Rangers in their last outing.

Player-assistant manager Adam Murray will take temporary charge, starting with Saturday's home game against Plymouth.

Mansfield chairman John Radford said: 'I've had a long discussion with Paul Cox (on Friday) afternoon about the future of the club. This is a club which both Paul and myself hold very close to our hearts.

'Unfortunately, as a result of those discussions, Paul and I have regrettably reached the conclusion that it's in the best interests of Mansfield Town Football Club if he stepped down from his current role with immediate effect.

'Therefore, the search now begins for a new manager.'
