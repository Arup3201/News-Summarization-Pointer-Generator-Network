A beauty blogger who has not washed her hair with shampoo for two years is claiming her hair is healthier than ever.

Lucy Aitken Read, 32, ditched shampoo in the bid to get thicker, fuller and more lustrous locks after recoiling at the amount of chemicals she was lathering on to her head.

Lucy went cold turkey using the ‘no-poo’ method, which involves using only water or natural substitutes instead of shampoo.

Natural: Beauty blogger Lucy Aitken Read, 32, who has not washed her hair with shampoo for two years is claiming her hair is healthier than ever

The movement is gaining momentum in beauty circles, with many claiming the benefits outweigh the negatives.

Lucy chose to ditch shampoo on the first day of a job in the charity sector, and confesses her biggest worry was that, ‘I wanted my hair to look good’.

She told the Telegraph: ‘I have always wondered whether the urban legend that if you leave your hair long enough it will start to wash itself was true or not. And when I became a mother I felt I should start looking more at what I was putting on and in my own and my children’s bodies.’

Healthy hair: Lucy uses the 'no-poo' method, which involves using only water or natural substitutes instead of shampoo

Despite not using shampoo for two years Lucy has managed to create ambitious styles with her hair

The rationale behind the ‘no-poo’ method is that shampoo strips the hair of its natural oils, which prompts the scalp to generate more oils to replace them.

This leaves the scalp greasy as it is overloaded with oil, which prompts us to then use shampoo.

By not using shampoo, ‘no-poo’ advocates claim it returns to its natural balance, keeping the hair clean by itself.

Lucy says in her book Happy Hair that the hair should be 
healthier and stronger as it is less damaged than shampooed hair.

However until luscious locks are achieved there is what Lucy calls ‘the tricky transition period’ in which the scalp continues to over-produce oils and she does admit there was a ‘smelly stage’.

But she kept working at it, with the use of head-scarfs and natural remedies, and now says she has glowing auburn hair.

Although she does admit she has been tempted to use shampoo:‘Once we were painting my house and I got paint in my hair and told my husband I was going upstairs to use his shampoo. He talked me down, because he knew I’d be disappointed afterwards if I did it. In the end I was able to just brush it out with a bristle brush.’
