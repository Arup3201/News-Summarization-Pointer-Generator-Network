Lukasz Fabianski insists Swansea will have no fear when they head to Old Trafford for their Premier League opener on Saturday

The Swans will be United's first league opponents under new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, but former Arsenal goalkeeper Fabianski has warned there is no danger of Swansea allowing the Dutchman a gentle introduction.

'I am not sure what they (United) are going to be preparing for,' Poland international Fabianski told Swansea's official website.

No fear: Lukasz Fabianski says that Swansea will not lie down for Manchester United on Saturday

'It's not going to be an easy game for them. We are going to give our best and try to win it.

'We are going to be well-prepared for the game and it's going to be very interesting.

'There is no point to fear the opposition, especially as Swansea beat them away in the FA Cup (last season) so we should not be fearing anything.

'They are a big club, but we are going to go there and try to get some points. That's our aim.

'We are not going to lie down and let them play. We are going to go for it as well and hopefully it will be a good game with a good result for us.'

Old and new: Fabianski enjoyed FA Cup success with Arsenal last season before moving to Wales on a free

Fabianski is expected to pin down the Swansea goalkeeping slot this term after arriving in Wales following a seven-year stint with Arsenal.

Gerhard Tremmel remains a key figure in the Swansea squad, but Dutch keeper Michel Vorm has departed the Liberty Stadium for Tottenham, with Fabianski looking set to be Garry Monk's first-choice stopper.

'You cannot really say that someone has given me the number one (shirt) and that's it,' Fabianski added. 'There is competition at Swansea, and I have to fight for it.

'We are competing for the spot, we are pushing each other, I am hoping that I am going to be the starting goalkeeper and that I will play well and I will help the team.'
