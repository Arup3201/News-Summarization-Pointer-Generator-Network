Court bill of £500: Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury’s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground

A grandmother of four told of her fury today after being fined more than £500 for dropping a cigarette butt.

Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury’s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground - before two council officers came ‘sprinting’ towards her to say she had committed a criminal offence.

Miss Copeland was then issued with a £50 fixed penalty notice following the incident in October last year, but refused to pay it within ten days in protest at how she was treated.

However, after failing to pay, she eventually received a letter ordering her to appear at Nuneaton Magistrates’ Court on March 17.

She was then fined £304 by magistrates who also ordered her to pay £200 court costs.

Miss Copeland was unable to attend the hearing because she had to look after her son Chez, 17, who has autism, and has now criticised the city council for taking her to court.

She said: ‘I was doing some shopping and was walking back home and cut through a couple of car parks. I heard these tyres screeching behind me and all of a sudden two women got out and started sprinting towards me.

‘I didn’t know whether to drop my shopping and put my hands in the air or walk towards them. I realised they had council uniforms on and they starting asking me if I was aware I had committed a criminal offence.

‘The first thing I thought was something hadn’t gone through the till properly at Sainsbury’s. I hadn’t even realised I had a cigarette. It is just automatic.

'I must have lit one up when I came out of the shop. My generation just discard the butts on the floor. If I had dumped a three-piece suite, then fair enough - but it was just a cigarette end.'

Miss Copeland added: ‘They were just so stern and officious. The way they spoke to me was horrible. It is the whole manner, they acted as if I had murdered somebody.’

The grandmother, who also has three grown-up daughters, is now considering whether to pay the fine by the deadline - which is tomorrow. If she refuses she could be taken back to court.

Miss Copeland said: ‘I’ve been treated like I have committed a major criminal offence. I didn’t pay because of how they were towards me but also the principle.

‘I’ve always been led to believe the punishment should fit the crime and in this case it doesn’t. I find it shocking. They are now saying I will face imprisonment if I don’t pay the fine.

'I don’t want to pay it because I won’t sleep at night if I do, but I might have to. I thought they were bluffing and it was scaremongering - I can’t believe they took someone to court over something this little.’

A Coventry City Council spokesman said the authority had a ‘zero tolerance’ policy towards litter.

Andrew Walster, who oversees the council’s streets policy, added: ‘It costs us about £2.5million a year to clean the streets in Coventry. There are plenty of litter bins within the city.’
