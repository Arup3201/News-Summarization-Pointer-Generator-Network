Boxing champion Errol Christie has revealed he is battling lung cancer in what he says is the toughest fight of his life.

The 51-year-old former European middleweight champion has started chemotherapy, walking to a hospital near his south London home for each session to keep fit.

The determined former boxer, who has never smoked, vowed that he would conquer cancer.

He told the Sunday People: 'I am just starting my treatment. I've had my first round of chemo and it has really been tough but I am going to beat this.'

Christie's son Louie, 26, said that his father had been unwell for a while but was only recently diagnosed with lung cancer.

Louie, who is also a boxer, said: 'It is a real shock because my dad has always been fit and has never smoked or drunk – it seems so unfair. 

'Being who he is, he didn’t want to make a fuss when he felt unwell. He thought it would clear up.

'It was a real shock when he got the results back. We were both stunned. But he is ­remaining positive and has vowed to beat it. He is determined to get well. I’m very proud of how he is coping.'

Christie was training amateur boxers, including X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, at Gym Box in London until last week but has been forced to put that on hold to focus on fighting his illness.

Christie's son was due to make his boxing debut as a featherweight next month but this has now been put on hold because of his father's diagnosis.

During his boxing career, the former champion fought 41 bouts, taking 32 wins including 26 by knockout.

He suffered eight defeats, most memorably to Mark Kaylor in 1985. 

The infamous match was preceded by an ugly scuffle at the pre-fight conference, and when the boxing finally got underway Christie lost in nine rounds in a match where both men were floored.

Although he boxed on into the early 90s, he was never the same fighter again and hung up his gloves in 1993.

Christie's greatest success came in 1982 when he defeated Mow Gruciano in what was then East Germany to take the European middleweight belt.

The father-of-one was involved in a scuffle with fellow former boxer Lloyd Honeyghan last October during a Boxing Writer's Club dinner at the Savoy Hotel in London. 

Frank Bruno had to step in to separate the pair after they squared up, but no punches were thrown.

Christie said at the time: 'There was a bit of an incident with Lloyd. I don't know what planet he was on but it's different from the rest of us. No punches were thrown. He was just mouthing off, acting the big shot.'
