A 21-year-old woman has vanished on a Grand Canyon rafting trip amid fears she fell into the river.

Kaitlin Anne Kenney joined the excursion along the Colorado River last week and was last seen at a camp on the river banks on Friday.

Her mother Linnea now fears her daughter from Englewood, Colorado, fell into the icy water river waters and is dead as rescuers in Arizona scale back their search.

Lost: Authorities have yet to find Kaitlin Anne Kenney, 21, who was last seen last Friday camping near the Colorado River

Gone: Kenny was rafting through the Grand Canyon's waterways when she vanished without a trace

'Please say a prayer for our family. Our sweet Kaitlin is with the 
angels,' Linnea wrote on Facebook.

Kenney was 
reported missing Saturday, and helicopter and ground crews searched the 
Tapeats and Deer Creek drainages, Surprise Valley and along the river 
all weekend.

A relative told 7NEWS the family believes Kaitlin may have got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and fallen into the river or gotten lost after becoming disoriented in the dark.

It was below zero the night she disappeared and she did not have her coat or any survival gear for that type of weather, the relative said.

Park spokeswoman Shannan Marcak described Kenney as 5-feet-5 inches tall, 125 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.

Devastated: The 21-year-old's mother Linnea posted this message on Facebook

Kenney was last seen wearing a tan coat and tan pants, a grey shirt, multi-colored scarf, black knit cap and hiking boots.

Ground-based crews scoured the 
Tapeats Creek area again Monday.

But Marcak 
said Tuesday that with no new clues, authorities have decided to scale 
back the search.

Marcak says efforts will 
continue in a 'limited mode in which rangers and pilots will continue to
search for clues when in the area.'

She says flyers with Kenney's 
picture and description also remain posted at popular river trip launch 
and takeout points.

Kaitlin is a talented musician who won first place in the young adult category at the 2011 Colorado Fiddle Championships.

She attended Cherry Creek High School and the University of Montana.

Her mother wrote on Facebook 'She was our balloon let loose in a room and lived life to it's 
fullest, always with a smile. We were blessed to have her in our lives.'

'She shared her spark of life and her 
beauty and her kindness and free spirit with everybody,' she told 
reporters. 'She never did anything that was ordinary and she was always 
out there and willing to explore.'
