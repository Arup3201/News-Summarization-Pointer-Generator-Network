Jailed: Connor Dawes followed the young man into a darkened alleyway where he knocked him to the ground and stole his phone and wallet

A teenage mugger who handed himself into police after realising that his victim had Asperger's syndrome told officers that he was 'scum'.

Connor Dawes followed the vulnerable young man into a darkened alleyway where he knocked him to the ground and stole his phone and wallet. 

But when Dawes rifled through the wallet, he found details on his victim's condition and turned himself into police. 

The 19-year-old told the officers that he felt 'very bad' for kicking his victim and described himself as 'scum'. 

He was jailed for two years at Warwick Crown Court after he admitted to robbery.

The court heard Dawes, from Nottingham, was in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, with a friend when the pair spotted the victim walking through the town centre alone at around 10pm.

He was caught on CCTV following the young man  for about five minutes before approaching the man in the alleyway. 

There, he knocked him to the ground and pulled off his coat before snatching his phone and wallet. 

The victim suffered a cut to his eye and as a result of the robbery. He now feels scared and vulnerable and is terrified of seeing his attackers in the street, the court heard.  

Dawes gave evidence at Nuneaton Youth Court against another alleged robber, but that youth was found not guilty.

Tom Schofield, defending, said: 'The first significant mitigation is his early guilty plea. He describes himself as 'scum' to the author of the pre-sentence report, reflecting his genuine shame at what he had done.

'And he handed himself in to the police, although he had then moved out of the area, and made full admissions.'

Mr Schofield said Dawes heard the police were making inquiries at the homes of friends in Nuneaton, so handed himself in.

Judge Sylvia de Bertodano told Dawes: 'A young man who suffers from Asperger's syndrome was walking through Nuneaton, and you and another young man started to follow him, clearly with the intention of taking the opportunity to rob him.

'You may not have known this young man had Asperger's, but you certainly knew he was vulnerable because he was on his own at night, and there were two of you and only one of him.

'This is a young man who struggles in life, and he has described in moving terms how much worse that struggle has become as a result of this.

'It is a great shame you come before the court for such a serious offence. It is clear that this was out of character.'

The judge added: 'I have two boys to consider; not just you but the boy you attacked and robbed. The message has to go out that people who do that go to prison.'
