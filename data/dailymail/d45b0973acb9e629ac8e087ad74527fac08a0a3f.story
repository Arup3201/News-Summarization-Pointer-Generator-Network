Alan Whitehead, Labour MP, said motorists who want to drive could be forced to join 'car clubs' in an article examining Britain's infrastructure problems

Owning a car could be ‘outlawed’ to force people on to public transport, a senior Labour MP has suggested.

Motorists who want to drive could instead be forced to join communal ‘car clubs’ where the cars are shared by drivers and used only when needed.

Dr Alan Whitehead, a Labour MP for Southampton Test and a member of the Energy and Climate Change select committee, said the increase in car ownership would lead to ‘something approaching a national traffic jam before 2040’.

He claimed that radical action would be needed to avoid national gridlock.

In an article in the Guardian, Dr Whitehead wrote: ‘We need to consider doing something serious. What we need is a considerable expansion of public transport over the next period and a shift from car to bus, train, bike or even feet. The big problem is how to do it.’

He went on to suggest that ‘outlawing’ car ownership was better than banning car use altogether, preferring ‘regulation rather than prohibition’.

Dr Whitehead added: ‘What if the Government simply regulated for cars to be sold and used just as they are at present (hopefully with an increasing presence of electric and hybrid vehicles) but outlawed individual ownership?

He warned the rise in car ownership would lead to ‘something approaching a national traffic jam before 2040’

‘People would then lease cars individually or as part of a club and the running costs would be included in the lease arrangements. No one would be prohibited from using a car, but the playing field of choice would instantly be levelled.’

But his suggestions were last night described as ‘bonkers’ by transport minister Robert Goodwill, who said Labour had waged a ‘13-year war’ against motorists.
