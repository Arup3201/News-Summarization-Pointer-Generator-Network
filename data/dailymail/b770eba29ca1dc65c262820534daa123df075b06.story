Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the EU of bullying Ukraine over the failed free trade deal

Russian president Vladimir Putin has accused Europe of bullying Ukraine after the country's politicians bowed to pressure from Moscow and backed out of a trade agreement with the EU.

Speaking in St Petersburg today, Putin said the EU had used 'pressure and blackmail' against Ukraine and denied that he had used his influence to block the deal.

He said: 'It will become clear in the next few days whether Ukraine and its leadership will yield to pressure or will be able to resist it and take a pragmatic stance in line with national interests.'

Protesters waving British and Ukrainian flags took to the streets of Kiev to vent their anger after the government announced it had ended talks with Europe.

Ukraine had been expected to sign the landmark  free trade and political association agreement at the Vilinius Summit next week.

But negotiations ended after the Ukrainian parliament refused to agree to release the imprisoned former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, one of the terms of the agreement.

Tymoshenko, who served as the country's first Prime Minister following the Orange Revolution in late 2004 and early 2005 was jailed in 2011 having been found guilty of abuse of office over a natural gas imports contract with Russia.

Speaking from prison today she said she was ready to urge the European Union to drop the demand for her release if that could help persuade the government to sign the agreement.

Tymoshenko, whose jailing the West calls politically motivated, also urged Ukrainians to take to the streets to protest the government's decision to shelve the deal and turn to Russia instead.

'She is calling on everybody to come out and express your civic position on the squares of all the cities of the country,' Tymoshenko's lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko said.

Following his disputed election victory 
in 2004, Ukrainian's Russian-speaking president Viktor Yanukovich was 
removed from power by the Supreme Court after one million people took to
the streets. But he was elected president in 2010.

Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk, accused Yanukovych of selling out to Moscow in exchange for cash and ensuring his re-election in 2015.

'This is a well-planned scenario by Yanukovych: how to sell the Ukrainian state and to buy himself a seat of the governor of Little Russia as part of the great Russian empire,' he said.

Yatsenyuk called on Ukrainians to join an opposition rally Sunday on Kiev's central square, the epicenter of the Orange Revolution which annulled Yanukovych's fraud-tainted victory in a presidential vote and helped bring his pro-Western opponents to power.

A smaller protest was already underway there. Several dozen activists wrapped in the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flags hid from rain under umbrellas.

'Europe is our future. In Europe a person is treated with respect,' said Vitaliy Tokaryuk, 25, a real estate agent who had spent the night on the Independence Square.

In 2010 presidential elections Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko. The next year, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison on abuse of office charges.

Sunday's rally will test the strength of the opposition, and some say that a large showing may nudge Yanukovych back in the direction of the EU.

Meanwhile the European Union's enlargement chief  Stefan Fuel said he had 'not fully given up' on Ukraine signing the deal next week, despite Kiev saying it was suspending work on the accord.

He said: 'No, we have not fully given up as we were not actually officially informed by the Ukrainian side that the signature is impossible at Vilnius,.'

If the deal with Ukraine is not signed next week, he held out hope it could be signed at an EU-Ukraine summit next year.

Ukraine's Prime Minister Mykola Azarov sought to defend the decision in parliament Friday, but was booed by opposition lawmakers, who chanted 'Shame!' and threw stacks of papers at his ministers.

Azarov said Ukraine cannot afford to lose trade with Russia and suggested the EU did not offer Ukraine any compensation for that.

He also complained that the conditions the International Monetary Fund has set for rescuing its struggling economy with a bailout loan were impossible to fulfil.

Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russian in the EU: in the first nine months of this year exports to the EU stood at $14.6 billion vs. $21.1 billion to Russia, while imports totaled $22.4 billion from the EU vs. $21.2 billion from Russia, according to Concord Capital, an investment firm in Kiev.
