While most people who enjoy flying might draw the line at a souvenir jet or mug, Anthony Toth's obsession has really taken off.

The airline sales director has spent two decades amassing an unmatched collection of memorabilia from Pan Am, which he has converted into a replica cabin at his home in Redondo Beach, California.

Mr Toth has spent $200,000 salvaging Pan Am airliner first class cabin parts for his airline tribute, including working seatbelt signs, oxygen masks and even 18 matching cabin seats.

Cabin fever: Mr Toth says his favourite part of his replica Pan Am cabin is a staircase from an original airliner

Commitment: Mr Toth has traveled as far as Bangkok in search of the exact parts for his well-researched Pan Am cabin

He has now turned his 625 square-foot garage into a first class cabin from the airline, which was one of the biggest in the U.S. until its collapse in 1991.

As well as seats and other accessories, Mr Toth has equipped the Pan Am cabin in his garage with all other in-flight accessories, including socks, eyeshades and extra headsets.

He says his favourite part of his unique collection is a winding staircase which led to a first class cabin on a Pan Am 747 in the early 1970s.

Mr Toth, Global Sales Director for United Airlines, said: 'To the people who live on the same street as me this is just the garage, but to me it's the Pan Am 747.

'What I really desire is, to be a part of what actually was the Pan Am cabin of the 1970’s and 80’s.

‘The great thing about Pan Am was that it was so identifiable – you could sit in that cabin and know exactly who you were flying with.'

Safety conscious: Should there be an in-flight emergency, Mr Toth has gone to great lengths to make sure everyone in his garage is safe

In-flight comforts: Items of cutlery, paperwork and tray tables help are all part of the attention to detail from Mr Toth

Many of the pieces of regalia were collected from a salvage site for aircraft in the Mojave desert, California, where retired aircraft are stripped down for spare parts, but Mr Toth has also had to travel as far as Bangkok in Thailand to find the perfect additions to his creation.

The collecter, who is now hoping that the cabin can be turned into a museum, isn’t as enamored by today’s first class service: ‘I didn't want to sleep when I flew,’ Mr Toth says. ‘I wanted to spend every minute enjoying everything that was happening.’

Mr Toth's bizarre collection has been featured along with other hoarders on U.S. programme My Crazy Obsession.
