Testing: Iran's Revolutionary Guard have test fired Shahab-3 missiles today, which are capable of hitting Israel (file picture)

Tensions have increased in the Persian Gulf today after Iran test fired long-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting Israel.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards tested several surface-to-surface weapons in the country's remote Kavir Desert, amid western fears the Islamic Republic wants to build nuclear weapons.

Iran said the test firing was a response to Israel and Washington's refusal to rule out military strikes to stop Iran's nuclear program.

The missiles fired today can travel distances of 800 miles (1,300km), a distance making them capable of striking Israel.

The
official IRNA news agency said the surface-to-surface missiles 
successfully hit their targets, while semi-official Fars said the salvos
included the so-called Shahab-3 missile.

The Guards' acting commander told state TV the tests were aimed at mock enemy bases in a war game exercise.

Iran
has tested a variety of missiles in previous war games, including a 
Shahab-3 variant with a range of 2,000 kilometers that can reach Israel 
and southern Europe.

The
launched missiles are also capable of hitting U.S. bases in the region,
with the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain, some 200 
kilometers from Iranian shores in the Persian Gulf.

Iranian state TV showed footage of several missiles being launched.

Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, who heads the
Guards' aerospace division, said: 'So far, we have launched missiles 
from 300 to 1,300 kilometers in the maneuver.'

The
Iranian commander quoted by Fars said Iran used both unmanned and 
manned bombers in the war games, and was firing a variety of other 
missiles.

Tehran says the drills aim to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of its warheads and weapons systems.

On Sunday, a European Union oil embargo meant to pressure Iran over its nuclear program came into effect.

Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has insisted the country's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes

The West suspects the Islamic Republic wants to build nuclear weapons, and Israel has hinted at an attack if diplomatic efforts and sanctions fail to eliminate what it sees as a direct threat.

Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, such as power generation and cancer treatment.

Last month Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appeared to indicate that Iran would be prepared to stop high-grade uranium enrichment.

Ahmadinejad said he would meet the demand of the United States and its allies if world powers agreed to meet its needs for the fuel.
