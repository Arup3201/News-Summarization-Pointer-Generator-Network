Luis Suarez struck twice for Barcelona in a friendly against the B team which was specifically organised to boost his fitness.

The Uruguayan striker, banned until late October, notched two goals as the first-team won 5-1 in a 60-minute game at the Ciutat Esportiva.

Suarez played well on top of his goals, working hard and unselfishly, making it clear that were it not for his ban, he would be in Luis Enrique's side.

Tata Martino last season tried on occasion to arrange similar friendlies, but was told that it may affect Barca B's schedule.

Enrique, on the other hand, didn't take no for an answer and it is likely he will arrange at least two more games against Barca B before Suarez's ban expires.

The aim is to have Suarez fit enough to play against Real Madrid, if needs be, which is the first match he is eligible for after his ban expires.

As well as Suarez, there were several other Barca players who benefited from the friendly.

Marc-Andre ter Stegen has spent time injured and would have been grateful for the opportunity to stake his place for a starting berth.

Full-back Douglas also played, although Lionel Messi, who missed Argentina's friendly against Germany on Wednesday because of a problem in his right leg, was not ready to feature.
