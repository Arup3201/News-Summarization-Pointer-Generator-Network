It may be one of the most stylish uniforms in the skies, but Virgin Atlantic’s cabin crew have been getting a bit hot under the collar about their new look.

The striking red outfits were designed by Vivienne Westwood and launched to much fanfare on September 1.

But the airline's crew members have since complained that the uniforms are too tight and that the shoes give them blisters.

The uniform features a double-breasted ‘drape coat’, which can be worn fastened or open

Staff also complained that the skirts are too high-waisted and don't fit properly, while the collars are so tight they make them bleed, according to union Unite.

A Unite spokesperson told The Sun: ‘We’ve had members complaining of poor comfort and injury caused by the new uniform and mainly as a result of blistering from shoes and garment fit.’

But Virgin Atlantic said the initial feedback from staff had been 'fantastic' and that the uniform could be tailored to fit all shapes and sizes. 

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Virgin Atlantic is extremely excited to launch its new uniform collection and initial feedback from staff has been fantastic

'To ensure the uniform was fit for purpose across our network, we conducted wearer trials globally for six months with over 150 staff volunteers who provided daily feedback on the fabric, fit, practicality and wearability of the uniform. 

'Adjustments were then made accordingly before the designs and fabrics were finalised.

'We recognise that the fit is different to the previous uniform and to ensure correct sizing, all staff tried on the uniform and were fitted by our expert team upon collection. We have uniforms available in sizes from 6 to 30 and garments can be tailored to fit all shapes and sizes.' 

Fanfare: Virgin Atlantic's boss Sir Richard Branson hosted a launch party for the new uniforms in July

VIP guests: Singer Debbie Harry and Vivienne Westwood joined Sir Richard Branson at the launch party

Sir Richard Branson’s airline launched the new uniforms at a star-studded party in July. Among the guests at the event in London were former Doctor Who star Matt Smith, Bond girl Naomi Harris, singer Debbie Harry and Vivienne Westwood herself.

The uniforms were made using recycled polyester clothing and took inspiration from some of Westwood’s most iconic pieces.

Female cabin crew wear a red pencil skirt, with a double pleat at the back, and a dramatic asymmetric frill-front blouse. The look is completed by a red jacket with a nipped in waist and high collar that was inspired by Westwood’s early 90s 'Bettina' jacket.

There is also a double-breasted ‘drape coat’ with an oversized collar, which can be worn fastened or open.

The red shoe worn by female crew is available in three heights. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: 'We understand the importance of comfortable footwear therefore the shoes were trialled extensively on the ground and in the air. 

'We offer a choice of low, medium and high heels for the women and based on feedback, looking to bring in a wider-fitting shoe. However, with all leather footwear, it will take time for them to wear in and be comfortable.'

The hand-drawn wing designs are a recurring theme across all members of the team and male crew members wear a Savile Row-inspired three piece suit in a deep burgundy Oxford weave wool.

Over 7,500 staff including cabin crew, pilots, Clubhouse staff and Virgin Holidays employees received the new uniform consisting of 22 pieces in total.

On a blog on its website, Virgin Atlantic said the uniforms were 'comfortable and practical' and had undergone a trial before their introduction on September 1.

It also stated that staff provided feedback after each flight or shift so that adjustments could be made ahead of the full launch.

The uniform was assessed on 'fit, comfort, breathability, ease of movement, creasing before and after the shift, look and feel of the uniform after laundering and how the uniform handles marks and stains'.

Virgin Atlantic said: 'We take all feedback very seriously and are working really hard with our uniform wearers to offer a uniform they feel proud to wear and to ensure they are happy and comfortable in their working environment.'
