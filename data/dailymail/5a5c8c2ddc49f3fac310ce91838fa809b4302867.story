In the cut-throat battle for  Christmas sales, Tesco, Morrisons and Marks & Spencer all announced humiliating defeats yesterday.

Tesco and Morrisons have been squeezed by a shift in shopping habits as customers desert to budget rivals.

In the City, shares in the two supermarkets were marked down amid warnings that profits will be below expectations.

The rise of online shopping and a move away from a big weekly shop also played a part, with families choosing to buy little and often online or at convenience stores.

Blow: M&S, whose Christmas ad campaign was fronted by model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, has revealed a tenth successive quarterly like-for-like sales decline, this time by 2.1 per cent in December

Marks & Spencer, like fellow high-end retailer Waitrose, did well on food – but poor sales at its struggling fashion department meant a weak overall result.

Earlier this week Sainsbury’s, the third largest supermarket, admitted it had seen the toughest festive period for 30 years.

For the first time in at least that long, less food and drink was bought this Christmas than the year before, industry experts say.

The disappointing figures heap pressure on all three chains to turn things around in the middle of the cost of living squeeze. Tesco admitted profits will be as much as £150million less than forecast, sending its shares down 2 per cent in early trading.

It is the second year in a row Britain’s  biggest supermarket has seen festive  takings fall. The 2.4 per cent decline came despite a £1billion improvement programme.

Chief executive Philip Clarke said: ‘Clearly Christmas was disappointing.’

Website and convenience store sales were up, but they fell in big out-of-town stores.

‘Consumers are still feeling they don’t have as much to spend,’ Mr Clarke said. ‘People are shopping more locally, shopping online more.’

High end: Waitrose saw sales 
rise by 4.1 per cent in the 12 days ending on New Year's Eve -- taking a 
record £51million on December 23, when an average of 22,000 items were 
sold every minute

Tesco dropped plans for 100 large Extra stores, and is carving up others and using the space for family restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, gyms and even play areas.

Phil Dorrell, of consultancy Retail Remedy, said: ‘Such  woeful Christmas numbers show Tesco is still stuck in a deep rut.

‘Its Christmas was dire. . . and the clearest indication yet that the chain’s £1billion turnaround package isn’t working.’

Arguably, Morrisons is in an even deeper hole than Tesco, with festive sales down by 5.6 per cent on a year ago, significantly more than at Tesco.

The company now says full-year profits will be at the lower end of forecasts, around £783million. Its shares slumped 7.75 per cent after a trading performance described as ‘quite awful’ by Clive

Black, an analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers. The  company’s growth has been hampered by its relatively small number of convenience stores and its slowness to offer an online shopping service.

Chief executive Dalton Philips said it is working hard to catch up and its first deliveries of online orders will go out today.

By contrast, Aldi and Lidl’s efforts to win over upmarket shoppers were met with success.

The stores offered higher quality food and drink, from aged fillet steaks at £5 to award-winning mince pies and fresh turkeys.

Meanwhile at Marks & Spencer fashion sales fell for a tenth  consecutive quarter.

Winners: Aldi and Lidl are believed to have increased combined sales by about 20% in the festive quarter

The retailer had pinned its hopes on a winter range by new style director Belinda Earl, the former boss of Debenhams. It also spent £5million on its ‘leading ladies’ ad campaign featuring women such as Dame Helen  Mirren and Tracey Emin in images by photographer Annie Leibovitz.

The company blamed a vicious high street price war and an unseasonably warm October as like-for-like fashion sales fell 2.1 per cent year on year for the 13 weeks to December 28.

Chief executive Marc Bolland said: ‘Anyone who was on the high street could see on the weekend of December 14 to 15, the whole market was already red [with sale signs].’

Negative clothing sales were offset by strong food sales, which were up by a total of 4.1 per cent in the three months leading up to Christmas.

Overall, M&S figures were not as bad as some analysts feared, and shares rose 3.6 per cent after falling for much of December.

Chancellor George Osborne said disappointing Christmas figures for some retailers were countered by positive results for John Lewis, Waitrose and Next.

He said: ‘What that says to me is it’s very competitive out there in retail, and people know that.

‘There’s also a big change happening in our country with more people shopping online.’

Waitrose has a long-standing link with the Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal, who has created a successful range for its stores

But how did Waitrose buck the trend?

Waitrose bucked the fall seen at its mainstream rivals thanks to a reputation for quality – and a loyalty card that offers free hot drinks.

The upmarket retailer has a long-standing link with the Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal, who has created a successful range for its stores.

This year he developed a number of festive products including gourmet chocolates, a stollen cake flavoured with Earl Grey tea and puff pastry mince pies with pine sugar.

His reputation for quality and innovation has rubbed off on Waitrose, which reported that sales for the 12 days ending on New Year’s Eve were up by 4.1 per cent on the same period a year before.

The perks offered by the chain’s myWaitrose loyalty card – a free cup of coffee or tea every day – have also been instrumental in bringing more people through the door.

The scheme has been controversial as it means that small independent coffee shops are losing trade, while some customers have complained that the free hot drinks attract a lower class of shopper.

However the chief executive, Mark Price, has been unrepentant, arguing that the immediate benefit is much better than points-based reward systems such as Tesco’s Clubcard or the Sainsbury’s Nectar card.

High-end food has done well in general this Christmas, with Marks & Spencer posting strong results for its grocery department.

Waitrose may also have benefited from its stores being ‘click and collect’ sites for the thriving wider John Lewis partnership.
