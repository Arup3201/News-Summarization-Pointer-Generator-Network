From Elijah Wood to Max Greenfield, the creative brains behind fashion e-tailer Mr Porter appear to have a penchant for actors-turned-model.

And the latest Hollywood hottie to star in a Mr Porter campaign is none other than Life of Pi star, Suraj Sharma.

Last seen tackling 30 foot waves with a tiger in tow, the 20-year-old New Delhi native looked picture perfect in the shots released by the e-tailer.

Polished: Sharma's new look is very different from the rags worn by Life of Pi character, Piscine Patel

Healthy: Sharma, who lost lots of weight to play Piscine Patel, now looks back on top form

Sporting a range of looks, including a sharp suit teamed with acid yellow trainers and a navy blue sporty jacket, the actor looked every inch the model.

Sharma's turn as Piscine Patel in the Oscar winning film was his debut Hollywood role and he admits that he was terrified when he first met director, Ang Lee.

'I had seen his movies, his movies had been a part of my life,' he revealed to the Guardian.  '[At the audition] I was so nervous I forgot my lines.

'I thought, "OK, now I've lost it". [Lee] gave me another chance. He talked to me, directed me.

Suave: Sharma is dapper in a chic taupe suit styled with neat tan brogues and pattered shirt

Cool: As you'd expect, the ultra fashionable Mr Porter team has done a top notch job of styling Sharma

'In less than five minutes – I don't even know how – it's just the way he looks at you and how he talks, it becomes very real. The second time, I read my piece and I started crying.'

But Sharma certainly isn't the first up-and-coming actor to have appeared in a Mr Porter campaign.

Along with Wood and Greenfield, the e-tailer has worked with Logan Plant, 32, son of Led Zeppelin frontman, Robert.

Last year's campaign also featured Marlon Brando's grandson, Tuki, 22, and Ethan Peck, 26, grandson of late actor, Gregory Peck.

Life Of Pi is available on 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD from April 29 and on digital platforms from April 15 from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.
