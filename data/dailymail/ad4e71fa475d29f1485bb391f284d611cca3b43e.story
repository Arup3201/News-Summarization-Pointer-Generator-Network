A co-pilot who hijacked an Ethiopian Airlines plane before landing it in Geneva was in mourning for an uncle, it has been revealed.

A relative of Hailemedhin Abera, 31, who seized control of Flight ET702 yesterday morning, has said Abera was in emotional distress for the past month after his uncle passed away.

The news comes at the same time a harrowing account of the hijacking, from a man who claims to have been on board, was posted to social media site Reddit.

Distressed: A family member of Hailemedhin Abera, 31, has said the co-pilot had been upset for the past month over the death of his uncle

Abera, who had worked for the airline for five years, locked the pilot out of the cockpit on the Rome-bound flight yesterday before diverting to Geneva, where he tried to claim asylum.

According to Reddit user OK3n, Abera suddenly dropped the oxygen masks into the cabin, before threatening to turn the oxygen off.

He said: 'I thought it was a simple technical glitch or somebody pressed the wrong button. Everybody looked at each other, thinking "what’s going on?"

'Suddenly, a deep and angry voice talked through the cabin radio: "SIT DOWN, PUT YOUR MASKS ON, I'M CUTTING THE OXYGEN", three times.

'At this point, I realised that the situation was serious: someone was in the pilot cabin and had hijacked the plane.'

The unnamed man claims passengers then spent the next six hours wondering what was about to happen to them.

In his account, he says the cabin crew handed out drinks and walked around the cabin reassuring people.

When he spoke to one to ask what was going on, he was simply told that the pilot had cut communication with the crew, and that they didn't know what would happen next.

He added: 'There was no sign of guards or anything in the cabin, apparently he was alone in the cockpit, locked.

'The stewardess were giving out water and saying safe words. However, you could see some of them were crying.'

Reddit user OK3n has posted an account of the hijacking from inside the plane, in which he says Abera told passengers 'sit down, put your masks on, I'm cutting the oxygen'

The passenger then says he was left for six hours to ponder his fate while cabin crew walked around giving out drinks and trying to keep everybody calm

He said the attendants didn't give out any information on what was happening, but could be seen crying

After six hours without any word of what was happening, the plane began circling, leaning one way then the other, at which point he was convinced they were about to crash.

He said: 'I was thinking : that’s it, we’re crashing into something. Looking down to the window I see a light, two, three, I can’t see what’s ahead.

'It’s still dark. We’re going fast, we’re flying over many houses now. And suddenly, under us, the airport. Just thinking again about this moment makes me shiver. We are landing. WE, are LANDING.

'Is this true? Is this a miracle? We touched the ground, and the plane eventually stopped completely in a bit away from the plane entrance to the terminal.

'I remember crying, while most of the people were applauding.'

He says they were then told about the co-pilot and warned that police would be boarding the plane shortly to evacuate them.

He added: 'We were checked and accompanied very kindly by the Swiss. There were sandwiches, hot chocolate, and free wifi.

'My mother was there, we went for a walk along the Leman lake and she cooked some good meal. The psychological impact is not negligible, I'm still in a state of shock.'

One of Abera's surviving uncles, Alemu Asmamaw, told the Associated Press that his nephew had been distressed over the death of another uncle.

Geneva prosecutor Olivier Jornot said the co-pilot will be charged with taking hostages, a crime punishable by up to 20 years.

Earlier today it was emerged that French
 fighter jets had to accompany a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane into 
Geneva airport because the Swiss air-force only work during regular 
office hours.

The Swiss pilots were alerted to the problem at 4.30am but are only operational in normal office hours - not before 8am.

Precaution: Geneva Airport was temporarily closed when the hijacked plane landed

An Ethiopian man smuggled a pistol onto a plane and hijacked a Lufthansa flight going from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa in 1993. He demanded it be flown to the U.S. because he was denied a visa.

In June and April 1994, Ethiopian Airlines suffered two hijackings at the hands of passengers who demanded to be flown to Europe, according to the Aviation Safety Network, which tracks aviation hijackings and other incidents.

In 1995, an Ethiopian man trying to avoid being sent back home used a knife from a food tray to commandeer an Olympic Airlines jet just before it landed in Athens, Greece. Police overpowered the hijacker with no injuries to any of the 114 people on board, according to AP reports.

Also that year, five armed men seized an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner and demanded the plane be flown to Greece and then Sweden. It was instead diverted to Al Obeid, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) west of Khartoum, Sudan.

In 1996 a flight from Ethiopia to Ivory Coast via Kenya was seized by hijackers who then demanded to be flown to Australia. That flight ran out fuel and crashed off the island nation of Comoros, killing 125 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network.

In 2001, five military pilot trainees wrested control of a plane during a flight from Bahr Dar, in northwestern Ethiopia, to the capital Addis Ababa and demanded to be flown to Saudi Arabia. The plane didn't have enough fuel so it landed in neighboring Sudan, according to AP reports.

In 2002 two passengers armed with small knives and an explosive device attempted to hijack a domestic flight but were shot and killed by in-flight security, the Aviation Safety Network reported.

A Swiss airforce spokesman Laurent 
Savary told AFP: 'Switzerland cannot intervene because its airbases are 
closed at night and on the weekend. It's a question of budget and 
staffing.'

The Boeing 767-300 aircraft with 202 
passengers and crew on board had taken off from the Ethiopian capital, 
Addis Ababa, and landed in Geneva at about 6am local time with just 20 
minutes of fuel remaining.

The
 plane circled around Geneva until the co-pilot, who had no criminal record and was declared 
medically sane, heard a direct response about his requests for asylum, 
it has been reported.

Geneva airport chief executive Robert 
Deillon told reporters that the co-pilot,
 took control of the plane when the pilot left the cockpit.

According to Sky News, passengers said 
the pilot repeatedly demanded the co-pilot open the cockpit door but the
 hijacker refused and threatened to crash the plane if the pilot carried
 on.

‘The pilot went to the toilet and he (the co-pilot) locked himself in the cockpit,’ Mr Deillon said.

The man 'wanted asylum in Switzerland',' he said. ‘That's the motivation of the hijacking.’

The
 hijacking began over Italy, Switzerland's southern neighbour, and two 
Italian fighter jets were scrambled to accompany the plane, Mr Deillon 
said.

The co-pilot himself 
alerted authorities to the plane's hijacking, officials added - though 
passengers on the plane were unaware it had been hijacked. After landing
 in Geneva, the co-pilot exited the cockpit using a rope and turned 
himself in to authorities.

Police escorted passengers one by one, with their hands above their heads, from the taxied plane to waiting vehicles.

Geneva
 prosecutor Olivier Jornot said Swiss federal authorities were 
investigating the hijacking and would press charges which could carry a 
prison sentence of up to 20 years.

Geneva airport was initially closed to other flights, but operations resumed around two hours after the hijacked plane landed.

‘We hope everything will return to normal in the afternoon,’ Mr Deillon added.

The flight apparently began emitting a 'hijacking code' as it flew over Sudan and this was picked up by aviation site Airlinereporter.com.

It tweeted in the early hours of Monday morning: 'Ethiopian Airlines’ Flight 702 Squawks “HiJacking” for Reasons Unknown.'

It reported that this beacon, known as a '7500', cannot come from a glitch.

The website said that the co-pilot kept the plane in the air over Switzerland and France until his asylum request was mentioned.

Ethiopian Airlines is owned by Ethiopia's government, which has faced persistent criticism over its rights record and alleged intolerance for political dissent.

Human Rights Watch says Ethiopia's human rights record 'has sharply deteriorated' over the years.

The rights group says authorities severely restrict basic rights of freedom of expression, association, and assembly.

The government has been accused of targeting journalists, opposition members, as well as the country's minority Muslim community.
