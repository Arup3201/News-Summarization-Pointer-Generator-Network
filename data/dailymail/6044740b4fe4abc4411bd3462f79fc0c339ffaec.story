Genetic evidence suggests that bed bugs originated in bats.

The new study comes as the number of bed bug infestations continues to rise and their resistance to insecticide is increasingly becoming a public health concern.

It is the first research to find genetic evidence for 'bat bugs' and bed bugs being linked.

University of Tulsa in Oklahoma scientists studied origin of bed bugs (stock image of Cimex lectularius shown). They found the first genetic evidence that bats are their origin. Research suggests human contact with bats in caves thousands of years ago led to them becoming a modern pest

When they bite, bed bugs inject tiny amounts of blood thinning and anaesthetic agents into their victim, triggering an immune response in humans.

In most cases, and if they are left alone, the bites calm down and disappear over the course of a week to ten days.

However, in some cases the person bitten has a bulbous reaction to the bite - this is when the skin erupts into pus-filled blisters.

While bed bugs are not known to carry diseases, doctors say there is still a question over whether they can transmit hepatitis B or C, although there are no proven cases. 

The study was carried out by scientists from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma, reported the BBC.

Experts looked at hundreds of bed bugs from human and bat dwellings across 13 different countries.

One in particular, Cimex lectularius, is useful for studying genetic diversity as it is a wingless insect, and therefore has relatively limited mobility.

Their findings suggest that all bed bugs ultimately had a similar origin.

It is thought that, as humans moved from Africa to Eurasia thousands of years ago, bed bugs would likely have sought both bat and human hosts in shared caves throughout Eurasia.

In addition, the researchers also found evidence for two predominant lineages in Europe that are so diverse, they are almost different species.  

In September 2014, a DNA study at Sheffield University showed that just one pregnant bed bug can cause an infestation.

The pregnant bed bug could rapidly create a colony of thousands of offspring that feed on humans.

Bed bugs' ability to generate a new colony from such small numbers might be a 'clue to their recent success.

During the day bed bugs lurk in the seams of mattresses (stock image shown), cracks in furniture, behind skirting boards and in crevices in the walls - coming out at night to feed on your blood. They go for exposed areas of the body such as the legs and arms - they don't tend to bother burrowing through clothing

In the late 1880s, an estimated 75 per cent of households were affected, but by the outbreak of World War II, that figure had dwindled to 25 per cent.

Their recent resurgence has been blamed by some experts on resistance to commonly used insecticides and the increase in international travel.

Bed bugs spread on clothes, bags and in furniture when it is moved - 'anywhere that people exist, particularly where they sit or lie down', according to bed-bug extermination expert David Cain.

They are wingless, rust coloured insects about the size of an apple pip.

But the scientists found the lineage of current bugs are starting to diverge

This is despite bats still remaining in regular contact with humans
