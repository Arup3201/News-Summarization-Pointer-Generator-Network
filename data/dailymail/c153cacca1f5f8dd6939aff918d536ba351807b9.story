Harbinder Khatkar has been found guilty of 18 sexual offences, including attacking six women in one night

A 'predatory sex offender' has been found guilty today of five rapes after attacking six women in one night.

Harbinder Khatkar, 37, targeted women over nine hours between midnight on February 1 and 9am the following day, including two in their own home.

He was today found guilty of 18 sexual offences at Derby Crown Court.

Khatkar was also retried for the rape of a woman in her home in Sinfin in December 2011, for which he had been acquitted at a previous trial.

Today, the jury found him guilty of that rape as well.

Detective Inspector Doug Naden, from Derbyshire Police, who led the investigation, said: 'Khatkar is a predatory sex offender who will rightly spend a long time behind bars reflecting on what he has done.

'These are some of the worst crimes imaginable and they have had a devastating and lasting impact on the victims and their families.

'I would like to recognise the bravery and resilience the victims have shown throughout the investigation and in facing their attacker in court, which must have been incredibly traumatic.'

Chilling CCTV footage released today by police shows Khatkar 
walking along Normanton Road shortly after midnight on February 2 before
 chasing one of his victims in the opposite direction.

The woman can be seen running along the road and then Khatkar is seen chasing after her.

Four minutes later the camera sees him walking casually back the other way.

During the five week trial, two women told the court how he had broken in and assaulted them in their homes.

One woman was sexually assaulted after she begged him not to hurt her or her daughter, who was in the house at the time.

Another was made to lie in the same bed as Khatkar after being assaulted, the Derby Telegraph reported.
