Well, if it works for them! Miranda Kerr, left, and Megan Fox, right, are big fans of apple cider vinegar and now, the tipple looks set to become the new big health drink after the first restaurant with a menu dedicated to the stuff has opened in London

The latest way to lose weight and maintain a youthful glow in Tinseltown is by sipping on a vinegar-infused drink every morning. 

Megan Fox has said that because of her 'really big sweet tooth,' she'll sometimes cleanse with a combination of apple cider vinegar and water, claiming it 'cleans out your system'.

Superfood and clean living advocate Miranda Kerr drizzles it on her salad, while Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna are said to devour fermented tonics to keep their looks in check. 

If you're laughing into your Coca-Cola reading this, hold that thought because the first restaurant with a menu dedicated to fermented vinegar has opened up in London - and the founders are convinced it's going to catch on.

Testing, testing: The Raw Duck in London's Hackney is the first UK eatery to have a menu dedicated to ferments and they create different ones every day, which they say are extremely cleansing 

The Raw Duck in London's Hackney is the first UK eatery to have a menu dedicated to ferments - and apple cider vinegar with a little sugar and grated apple left to develop for three days is one of its most popular concoctions.

'These are deliciously cleansing and help aid digestion,' owner Rory McCoy told The Metro. 

'When we talk about probiotic, we think of those mass-produced yoghurts but these are the real thing. People should know about them. I try to drink a vinegar or eat a ferment every day for my health.' 

Speaking about the hot new £5 tipple, Katy Mason, Nutritionist at The Nutri Centre, told MailOnline: 'During the fermentation process, sugars are broken down by bacteria and yeasts, into alcohol, if you ferment this further then you get vinegar. You can make vinegar from many things fruits: vegetables and grains and in the case of apple cider vinegar - apples!

'Vinegar has been used for centuries for many purposes, pickling, cleaning as a condiment and for health. If you look on the internet you will find claims that vinegar, especially apple cider vinegar will relieve just about any ailment you can think of.'

Benefits: Apple cider vinegar is used to support digestion and the liver and spleen, to heal bruises, boils and insect bites, to support oral and heart health and relieve headaches

She continued: 'Nutritional therapists have known about this product for years and will often recommend it to clients to help stimulate the digestion, alkalise the body and help with weight loss.

'The best apple cider vinegar to take is the less processed cloudy version, which looks like it has bits in it, these bits are called mother (living enzymes and bacteria) which are where a lot of the health benefits come from.'

A spokesperson for Neal's Yard Remedies added: 'There’s more to vinegar than salad dressings and marinades. Studies have shown that it also has multiple medicinal properties.

'The earliest known uses of vinegar dates back more than 10,000 years and it started being produced and sold commercially across the known world 5,000 years ago.

'In ancient Chinese medicine, vinegar (made from rice) is bitter, sour and warm and its function is to drain and treat stagnation. Thus it is used to support digestion and the liver and spleen, to heal bruises, boils and insect bites, to support oral and heart health and relive headaches.
