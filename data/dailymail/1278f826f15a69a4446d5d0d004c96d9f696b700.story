Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the center of an investigation into the targeting of conservative groups, has spoke out for the first time since she invoked her legal right not to testify against herself at a congressional hearing more than a year ago.

Lerner sat down with Politico ahead of a profile it released on her this morning and revealed that she has received death threats since leaving the government agency and has been called hateful names, like 'dirty Jew' and told she'll 'go down in history as the worst person ever in the United States.'

Another time someone told her she was 'going to be put away in the deepest, darkest dungeon, and they were going to lock me up and throw away the key.' One death threat was so bad that federal agents had to guard her home, Lerner said.

Despite the fallout from her admission last May that the IRS had inappropriately scrutinized some groups with political affiliations more than others, Lerner said she has no regrets about the way she handled herself throughout the controversy.

'I didn’t do anything wrong,' Lerner told Politico. 'I’m proud of my career and the job I did for this country.'

Lerner recently spoke out about a controversy involving her department's targeting of conservatives for the first time since the congressional hearing

Lerner had mostly faded into obscurity since refusing to give testimony to a House Oversight committee last year, claiming that she could self-incriminate herself, before her lengthy interview with Politico.

Although her name has been in the news consistently over the last several months as the IRS revealed to congressional investigators that a computer crash caused the loss of a large chunk of Lerner's emails from 2011-2013, Lerner herself has stayed out of the fray until now.

In her interview Lerner defended herself against accusations being made by conservatives, including claims that she purposefully ruined her hard drive to throw investigators off her trail.

'How would I know two years ahead of time that it would be important for me to destroy emails, and if I did know that, why wouldn’t I have destroyed the other ones they keep releasing?' she asked.

Lerner told Politico she believes she's receiving much of the blame for her department's wrongdoing because she was the first IRS official to acknowledge it publicly.

'I was the person who announced it,' she said. 'I assume the other part of it is because I declined to talk, and once I declined to talk, they could say anything they wanted, and they knew I couldn’t say anything back.'

Former colleagues of Lerner suggested to Politico that they agreed and argued that the former tax exempt chief was not the only IRS official who  made missteps in the years leading up to the public controversy.

And despite being a registered Democrat, Lerner told Politico that she'd voted for candidates from both political parties and that generally, she's 'not a political person.'

 A former boss of Lerner's at the Federal Election Commission, where Lerner worked for 20 years before moving over to the IRS in 2001, backed up Lerner's self-assessment.

But two former colleagues of Lerner's from the FEC, both of whom are Republicans, said she was a partisan to the core, as evidenced by her vocal support of stricter oversight of political donations, a stance generally held by progressives and strongly opposed by conservatives.

'Lois’ ideology is against money in politics, is ‘anti-contribution’; that’s her bias,' Craig Engle, a former executive assistant to a Republican FEC commissioner told Politico.

'Her ideology inhibited fair administration of the law.'

Former coworkers at the IRS also offered up mixed opinions of Lerner, with some saying they 'really loved her big personality,' as Politico put it, and others depicting her as someone who was overly passionate about her work and 'snapped to judgment quickly.'

'We didn’t always get along, ' Nikole Flax, the former chief of staff to the IRS commissioner in charge when the targeting scandal erupted, told the House Oversight committee during its investigation into Lerner. 'We would have occasions when I would, you know, call her, and she could scream for a minute.' 

'Her fuse was short, and if you come to the IRS, you better be able to sit and listen and ask questions and absorb and rethink, and she had a hard time doing that,' recalled Debra Kawecki, who worked with Lerner at the IRS at the beginning of her tenure there. 

Kawecki retired in 2006, Politico noted, five years after Lerner began working there and the same year that Lerner took over the tax exempt division of the agency.

A former director of the same department Lerner oversaw at the IRS suggested that her limited knowledge of tax policy may have led to her division's inappropriate probing of groups it suspected of political activity.

'When managers are not familiar with the laws they are enforcing, they make bad decisions,' Marc Owens, a former tax exempt division head, told Politico. 

He also indicated that side projects Lerner pursued that were meant to streamline processes at the agency may have been a 'major contributing factor' to slow approval process of conservative groups' applications for non exempt status after the IRS' investigation into them concluded.

Emails of Lerner's that were turned over to congressional committees investigating the matter show that the IRS agency sought to rectify the situation in early 2013 as a government investigation threatened to expose the department's bad behavior.

A group of emails released by a Senate subcommittee indicate that the IRS and Lerner were worried about the findings of the Treasury investigation and wanted to get their side of the story out before the government agency's Office of Inspector General released it's own report.

Throughout the OIG's investigation Lerner maintained that scrutiny of conservative groups was not politically motivated and was instead the result of department policy to more heavily screen organizations whose names included politically charged phrases like 'tea party' and 'patriot.' 

She also argued that the IRS' intense examinations of those groups did not often result in them being denied tax exempt status, proving that the IRS was no more discriminatory of right-leaning groups than it was other organizations when it came to handing out tax benefits.

Sensing that Treasury intended to side with conservative groups who were crying foul, the IRS concocted a plan to acknowledge the targeting, explain that that it was the result of poor management of 'front-line staff' in it's Cincinnati, Ohio, branch and hope that the incident blew over quickly. 

The IRS first planned to have Lerner apologize for providing lax oversight of the satellite office in a speech she was giving in late April but decided against it last-minute. She eventually commented on the situation at another public speaking engagement several weeks later.

At that event, hosted by the American Bar Association, Lerner, who is herself a lawyer, staged a question about the affair so that she could deliver the agency's mea culpa in a controlled environment.

The admission set off a media firestorm, and within days IRS commissioner Steven Miller was forced to resign. A week after that, Lerner was put on indefinite leave. 

Before the IRS could terminate her employment, she followed through with a previously planned retirement and left the tax agency for good with a full pension, which is valued at approximately $100,000 a year. 

Much of that money now goes towards Lerner's legal fees, which she says have already exceed $100,000. 

Lerner told Politico that she'd like to work in the tax or legal profession again but she's been unable to find employment elsewhere and can't even get volunteer jobs at organizations outside of Washington in her line of work.

As a result, Lerner has taken up volunteering at a local arts non profit, though she wouldn't tell Politico which one - 'I feel like having my name attached does nothing but cause issues for people,' she said - and spends her remaining free time gardening and walking her dogs.

Even though she's had a difficult time recovering from the controversy both personally and financially, Lerner says not going to let her detractors 'ruin my life.'

'Regardless of whatever else happens, I know I did the best I could under the circumstances and am not sorry for anything I did,' she said.
