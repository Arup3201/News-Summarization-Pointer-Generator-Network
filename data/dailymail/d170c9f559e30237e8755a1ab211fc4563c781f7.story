Illuminated in dazzling sea-greens, blues and purples and sculpted into jagged shards, these ice caves certainly do not look of this world.

In fact, they are in  Russia, and the striking effect is the result of the sun's rays penetrating the glacial ice.

Shaped by a hot spring that runs past the volcanoes in the Kamchatka peninsula, the water has created beautiful translucent tunnels. As it melts over the years, the layer of ice has dwindled, producing the otherworldly illuminated effect inside the cave.

Photographer, Sergey Krasnoshchekov, 28, waited until the summer before making the expedition but was worried that parts of the 1km cavern might collapse.

Curiosity got the better of the Russian photographer, though, resulting in this extraordinary collection of images.

'The caves are difficult to access as you need special off road vehicles to reach the location,' says Krasnoshchekov.

Dedicated: Sergey spent a few days at the remote caves, which require an off-road vehicle to access

'I spent a couple of days near the caves but not too much time inside. I was afraid the roof might collapse as its so close to an active volcano.

'But it in the end I couldn't resist the opportunity to go and take some pictures and just went for it.

'The colours inside the cave are truly stunning, it feels as if you are in another world when you step inside,' he adds.

'It takes your breath away': Krasnoshchekov reveals that his group were stunned into silence by the jaw-dropping scenes

'There was a stunned silence as we all walked in, the colours are so blue and bold it really takes your breath away.

'The cave looks this way because of the sun rays trying to push through the ice, I have never seen anything like it before. It was very cold inside but I was so caught up in the moment that I barely noticed, in the end I didn't want to leave.'

The photographer has also captured volcanic eruptions in the Kamchatka peninsula, which is home to a large cluster of over 100 volcanoes, some of which are included on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
