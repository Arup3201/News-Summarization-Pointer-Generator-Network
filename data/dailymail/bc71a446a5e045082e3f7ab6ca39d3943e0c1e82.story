This is the moment a young man appears to pass out after being tickled, causing panic among friends.

Larry Benjamin, a student at Cairn University in Pennsylvania, was filmed as he willingly got down on the floor to have his underarms and belly prodded.

Around ten seconds in, footage shows his body suddenly falling limp, his eyes shutting and his screams of laughter turning to silence.

One woman watching the stunt refuses to believe what's happening.

'You're lying right now, you're lying right now,' she says to a lifeless Larry.

She tells others gathered around to check his pulse to make sure he's still breathing.

Concern starts to mount as Larry doesn't flinch while friends poke his nostrils and lift his arms.

'That is crazy,' one man says. 

Another onlooker adds: 'I saw his eyes roll into the back of his head.'

One bystander asks how long it takes Larry to wake up, adding that it's the 'craziest thing' they've ever seen.

A friend confirms Larry usually wakes up after around two minutes.

But this time around he regains consciousness sooner and springs back up after less than a minute.

Despite his energetic bounce back, Larry seems to be in a daze and rolls over with his head in his hands.

'I don't know how good that is for his heart,' an observer muses.

To date the video clip, filmed in 2012, has garnered more than one million hits. 

Many viewers have criticized the footage for being fake. 

However, some have said they know people who have the same reaction to being tickled.
