A dog lover was involved in a dramatic rescue of four puppies in a bid to save them from suffocation when a homeless man put them in a Tupperware box.

In a desperate attempt to slow down a bus carrying the man and retrieve the pets, Annie Hart enlisted a friend to drive in front of the vehicle and restrict its speed until she could reach it herself.

When she got there, she persuaded the driver to open the doors for her and bribed the homeless man to hand over the puppies.

The tiny dogs have been nursed back to health and will soon be put up for adoption, allowing them to receive the nurture they never had before their rescue.

Ms Hart, who runs an animal rescue charity called the Bill Foundation, recounted the story of the dramatic car chase through Los Angeles a few weeks ago at Dogster.

She received a call late at night from her friend Samantha Haas, another animal charity activist, saying she had seen a homeless man with a sealed Tupperware box containing four puppies.

Ms Haas had tried to persuade the man to hand over the dogs for their own safety, but he refused and boarded a bus.

Ms Hart told her to pull in front of the bus and drive slowly, to allow her and her husband to arrive on the scene and stage an intervention to save the animals.

Although the bus driver started honking his horn in irritation, the plan seemed to be broadly working, and the Harts were able to catch up - accompanied by their own pet dog Arnold.

When the bus stopped to let passengers off, Ms Hart wrote, 'James hits the gas and slides up behind the bus, I hop out and dash for its open door. It closes.

'Like a lunatic I am jumping up and down, calling for the driver to open the doors. Like a completely sane person, he drives away.'

The bus stopped again a few minutes later and this time Ms Hart persuaded the driver to let her on by explaining her mission.

She located the young homeless man, and saw that he was pushing a cart with a Tupperware container which had four puppies inside.

After striking up a conversation with him, she explained her job and asked if he wanted to get off the bus so they could work out 'how to help his puppies'.

During a one-on-one conversation monitored from a few yards away by her husband, Ms Hart convinced the man to hand over three of the animals by giving him cash.

However, he insisted he had promised the smallest one to a friend, and could not give it up.

When the group had ensured the safety of the three puppies, Mr Hart headed into the night to find the homeless man and retrieve the final dog.

He told him: 'You aren't sure your friend is going to take this puppy. Tell you what - you give your friend some of the money I'm paying you, then he can pay the fee to rescue another dog from the shelter. Two dogs get saved.'

Happily, the gambit worked, and the Harts were able to take all four animals home.

Due to the 'comic book' nature of the bizarre rescue, the couple named the dogs after characters from X-Men - Luke, Elliott, Raven and Logan.

Ms Hart told the Huffington Post: 'Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd be involved in a high-speed chase down Santa Monica Boulevard at midnight, my husband behind the wheel while I direct my friends - via cell phone - to stop a bus by creating a road block with their car.

'But when I heard there were four lives in danger something instinctually kicked in, and nothing was going to stop me from trying to save these pups.'

The dogs, which seem to be around 10 weeks old, will be put up for adoption in two weeks' time.
