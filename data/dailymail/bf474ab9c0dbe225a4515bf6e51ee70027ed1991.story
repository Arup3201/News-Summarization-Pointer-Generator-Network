Steve Bruce and Hull City were supposed to be the history boys this season – they certainly didn’t expect their maiden European adventure to be consigned to the record books before August is out.

But that is the sobering reality facing supporters who were still drunk on dreams of the San Siro and the like. They had waited 110 years for continental competition on Humberside but – after two ties and before the Europa League group stage had even begun – they are out, free again to concentrate on domestic matters.

Is that, though, any consolation for Bruce?

‘We know how difficult it has been to do what we’ve done – play four European games already - but make no mistake, we wanted to be in the group stage,’ he said, later confirming that Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez is set to complete his £10million move from Palermo, pending a work-permit hearing.

‘We wanted the big European nights. It’s a shame we won’t have that. The experience has gone too quickly for everyone concerned – and that is the big disappointment.’

Hull – beaten 1-0 in Belgium last week – levelled the tie after just six minutes through Robbie Brady before Jordan Remacle smashed an equaliser after half-time. Brady, though, sparked hope with a conversion from the penalty spot only for Yannick Sagbo to get himself sent off following a risky lunge late on.

It meant their premature exit was sealed on the away-goals rule.

And Bruce reflected: ‘That’s European football – the frustration, the disappointment, the away-goals rule.

‘But we didn’t play to the level I expected. We gave the ball away cheaply. Four or five didn’t perform to the level we would expect.

‘To go out on away goals is the worst feeling – but that’s Europe. We didn’t get to grips with it well enough tonight.’

A fortnight earlier, in the return leg with Slovakian side AS Trencin, Hull had conceded early to set up a nerve-shredding night which only found relief 10 minutes from time when Sone Aluko scored the goal to send them through.

This time, however, home nerves were settled rather than frayed as Brady stole in at the far post to turn in Maynor Figueroa’s teasing centre.

In hindsight, the breakthrough merely bred complacency and the Belgians bossed the remainder of the opening half.

Last week’s match-winner Hans Vanaken was denied when his low blast was diverted wide by the desperate toe of Curtis Davies and, from the resulting corner, towering centre-back Mijat Maric somehow headed over from six yards.

The visitors emerged the brighter after the break and, when Allan McGregor failed to fist clear of his area from a corner, Remacle snaffled possession before lashing through bodies and into the top corner on 48 minutes.

Hull, though, came back at Lokeren and Brady had his second from the penalty spot seven minutes later. Ahmed Elmohamady crossed from the right, the ball catching the arm of Koen Persoons on what looked like the fringe of the area. Romanian referee Ovidiu Hategan and his assistant thought different, however, and Brady took advantage, Bruce unable to watch the Ireland winger tucking home.

The award infuriated Lokeren boss Peter Maes – previously a picture of cool as he supped a beer during his post-match reflections last week – and he was sent to the stands.

But it was opposite number Bruce incensed soon after when Sagbo was shown a straight red for a high challenge on Giorgis Galitsios. The 10 men were unable to recover.

And Bruce said: ‘I think the sending off is very harsh. You wouldn’t be sent off for that in the Premier League. He doesn’t go over the ball at all, it’s a harsh decision.

‘But you can’t dwell on it. It’s disappointing for everyone concerned. It would have been terrific to get to the group stage.

‘The players are a resilient mob and they will come back in and dust themselves down. They will get over it.’

Dreams of trips to Inter Milan now await Maes and Lokeren in today’s group-stage draw, and he said: ‘I think we deserved it. What we did on the pitch was very good.

‘Their goal was an individual mistake but we recovered from that and played more aggressive. We played with a lot of confidence and we’re delighted to be through.’
