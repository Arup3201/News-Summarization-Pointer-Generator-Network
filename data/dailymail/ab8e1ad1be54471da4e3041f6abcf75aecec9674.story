Gary Rowett has accepted the Birmingham City manager job and the announcement is expected to be made on Monday.

Burton  confirmed the 40-year-old has been appointed as the replacement for the sacked Lee Clark at the Blues.

Birmingham were intent on making the appointment early this week after their 8-0 humiliation at home against Bournemouth.

The Burton Albion boss impressed a four-man panel during talks last week, and is likely to bring assistant manager Kevin Summerfield, first-team coach Mark Sale and goalkeeper coach Kevin Poole with him from the League Two club. 

Rowett made 106 appearances for Birmingham as a player in the late nineties and is a welcome choice among fans disillusioned at the running of their club.

The 40-year-old, who led Burton to the League Two play-offs in his two seasons in charge, will want a clear understanding of finances at the Championship club.

Rowett spoke about the situation after Burton lost against Stevenage on Saturday. 'It is up to them (Birmingham) to make a decision of what they want, and then it is to whoever they make that decision for to give an answer.’
