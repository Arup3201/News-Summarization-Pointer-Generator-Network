Benjamin Proud got England off to a flying start in the Commonwealth Games pool on Friday night.

The 19-year-old Londoner landed gold for his country in the 50 metres butterfly, the first final of a pulsating evening session, leaving South African superstar Chad le Clos among those in his wake.

Proud won in a British and Games record time of 22.93sec, with South Africa’s Roland  Schoeman second in 23.13 and Le Clos  taking the bronze in 23.36.

Le Clos, 22, was one of the stars of London 2012 with his family earning wider endearment through the colourful and regular presence of his emotional father, Bert, during the Olympic TV coverage.

But it was a different kind of Proud occasion last night.

The new champion, who trains in Plymouth under Jon Rudd, said: ‘I don’t know what to say. I just treated it like any other race, but now tears are almost in my eyes.’

Proud only made his big breakthrough last year, being the top home sprinter at the British international meet in Leeds in March 2013, when he won 50m butterfly gold and 50m freestyle silver.

Then, in a race that marked him out as one to watch, he broke Mark  Foster’s 10-year-old British 50m butterfly record in the semi-finals of the British Championships as he took the fly title.

That and other decent performances at the Nationals earned him a place at last year’s World Championships in Barcelona, where he finished 18th in the 50m freestyle and 11th in the 50m fly.

‘I’m happy for Ben,’ said Le Clos last night while Foster, at poolside as a BBC pundit, said: ‘I was a bit gutted when Ben broke my British record, but it had stood for long enough, I suppose!

‘This was a mature swim, he just got everything right and he was in the zone. He will get stronger and there is lots more to come from him.’

Scottish fans were celebrating a bronze for Corrie Scott in the 50m breaststroke.
