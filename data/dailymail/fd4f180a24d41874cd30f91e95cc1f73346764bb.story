Captain Alastair Cook suffered further humiliation at Headingley yesterday as England fell towards their first-ever home Test series defeat by Sri Lanka.

Cook’s position as captain will surely come under intense pressure after England allowed the tourists to set a daunting target of 350 with some woeful bowling.

Cook was then out playing on to his own wicket when his side desperately needed him to contribute a big score. England ended day four on a humiliating 57-5. The prospect of a damaging series loss comes after Cook’s winter of despair in Australia featuring the 5-0 Ashes whitewash under his leadership.

Under pressure! Alastair Cook could be in danger of losing captaincy after dismal run including Ashes whitewash

Senior batsman Ian Bell attempted to back Cook as captain but former Test great Geoffrey Boycott said on the BBC: ‘The captain is in terrible form. It is a recipe for resignation. I don’t know if he will but it is.’

With England only five wickets away from losing a match which had been theirs for the taking on Saturday afternoon, the man most likely to replace Cook in case of a sacking or resignation insisted he was still the right man for the job. 

‘I’m sure he’s pretty disappointed, as we all are’ said Bell.  

‘He’s got more hundreds than anyone in an England shirt and he’s one of the best batsmen I’ve ever played with. One innings and he’ll be flying again. But as a group we’ve got to help him. We’ve got to get right behind him and start performing as a team.’ 

Asked whether he thought Cook still had the desire to carry on, Bell replied: ‘Absolutely. No doubt.’ 

On a day when Boycott branded England ‘rubbish’ and ‘pathetic’  and a small section of the crowd booed them off at tea, Bell conceded that the defensive fields set for Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews — who made a world-class 160 — hadn’t worked. 

He said: ‘If you want to stop someone like that scoring runs, you get them out, don’t you? You don’t stop them scoring runs. But we didn’t take our chances.’

Sri Lanka veteran Mahela Jayawardene said he felt some sympathy for England’s captain, but he was obviously revelling in Cook’s discomfort. ‘I feel for him, but it doesn’t help when you have arguments with commentators and past cricketers,’ he said.

‘That’s something you can’t control.  ‘Under pressure England are not quite up to it. There are young guys in their side and they will get some tomorrow morning.’ 

‘We were telling a couple of their batsmen that their idea of hurting us by hitting us on the head probably doesn’t work. And their field setting showed they were worried. They were quite chirpy at first, but quieter after first hour or so.’
