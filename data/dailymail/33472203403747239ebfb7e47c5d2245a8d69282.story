Under fire: The British military are not doing enough to stop migratory birds in the Mediterranean being killed by nets or traps, according to a conservation group

The British military are not doing enough to stop migratory birds in the Mediterranean being killed by nets or traps, a conservation group has claimed. 

More than two million migratory birds were deliberately killed in Cyprus last autumn, according to new data. 

The birds, which cost 80 euros (£86) for a dozen, are a local delicacy known as ambelopoulia.

The illegal activity has now caused a drastic drop in the numbers of blackcaps, robins and songbirds and has been dubbed 'out of control'.

A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a partner of Birdlife Cyprus, described the issue as 'trapping on an industrial level'.

He said: 'We are hoping that we can begin to get a grip and would like the British base of Dhekelia to help clear the acacia, which trappers plant to lure in birds. 

'It is so obvious when it is taking place. It is easy to detect and easy to see where it has been planted. We accept it is a difficult job but we would like to see some commitment to a timetable. 

'Unfortunately last year the action the British military took was too late because it was after the trapping season. 

'At the moment the Ministry of Defence are arguing with our figures but everybody needs to work together.

'Trapping itself has been illegal since 1974 and it is against the laws and regulations of the base area.' 

The birds are caught by trappers using netting or limesticks - twigs covered in sticky lime or glue. 

Nearly ten miles of net supports and more than 6,000 limesticks were discovered between September and October last year, according to Birdlife Cyprus.

Trappers, who like to use the area around Dhekelia, also play birdsong through loudspeakers hidden in the bushes to lure more in and throw gravel to force birds towards their nets.

Nearly 4,000 poachers are believed to be involved in the autumn trapping season - much higher than in summer because the birds are plumper. 

Clairie Papazoglou, Birdlife Cyprus' chief, said poaching was a 'serious, persistent and growing problem'.

She added that it 'has been the worst year with the highest trapping levels since the start of the monitoring programme in 2002'.

The trappers connect MP3 players or CD players to car batteries and speakers hidden in the bushes. They then play birdsong and lure birds into hidden nets

Birdlife Cyprus has also called for tougher sentencing but admitted attitudes towards killing and eating migratory birds would have to change to make a difference. 

Poachers that are caught can currently receive penalties of up to three years in jail and fines as high as 17,000 euros (£12,215). 

A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: 'We do not accept the report’s unverified claims about loss of bird life during this period, which was based upon data collected from a very short period. 

'We are committed to tackling poaching which is why we arrested nearly 50 poachers and seized 450 nets and 286 piece of poaching equipment during the last migration period. When we catch poachers we can fine them €17,000, or send them to prison for up to 3 years. 

'We continue to work with local organisations to discuss how we can work as effectively as possible.'
