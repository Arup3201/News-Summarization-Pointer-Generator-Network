A teenager nicknamed 'Nando's' because of his love of the fast food chicken chain has had its logo tattooed on his bottom, only for his request for free meals to be given the cold shoulder.

Nando's superfan Bradley Holman had the cockerel mascot Barcelos permanently etched on his right buttock as a sign of his love for the restaurant.

However, when the 19-year-old from Lower Kingswood, Surrey, contacted the company asking for a reward for his customer loyalty, his request was rebuffed.

Cheeky:  Bradley Holman got the inking done during a holiday to Malia, Crete in July 2013. The etching took two hours and cost him 90 euros

Favourite: Mr Holman, 19, says he eats at Nando's every time he goes out for dinner, and  estimates that he spends more than £1,500 at Nando's every year

'Ever
 since I first tried their Peri-Peri chicken five years ago, I’ve been 
crazy about Nando’s. I’m a huge fan,' said Mr Holman, who estimates that
 he spends more than £1,500 at Nando’s every year.

'Whenever
 I go out for a meal now, it’s always Nando’s. I order the same thing 
every time - an extra-hot whole chicken to myself, garlic bread and a 
bottomless drink. Nothing beats it.

'My friends and locals around my hometown call me "Nando’s" because I love it so much. People are always asking me to get my bum out so they can see my tattoo.'

The Assistant Store Manager got the inking done during a holiday to Malia, Crete in July 2013. The etching took two hours and cost him 90 euros.

'I was feeling hungover after a 
night out and all week, I had been craving a nice Nando’s. I was telling
 my mates about it and they suggested I get a tattoo of it. I thought 
that sounded right up my street.

'So
 I went to the nearest tattoo parlour and asked for the Nando’s cockerel
 on my bum cheek. The whole process was painful especially after the 
alcohol had worn off but it was worth it.'

After having the inking done, Mr Holman contacted Nando’s in the hope they would offer some thanks for his dedication.

'I
 emailed Nando’s to tell them that I got the tattoo of their chicken on 
my bum because I really liked the restaurant,' he said.

Worthwhile: Mr Holman said that while getting his tattoo had been painful, getting the inking was still 'worth it'

'I
 asked if they rewarded customer loyalty like this and they snubbed my 
questions saying they don’t give any free meals or vouchers to 
customers.

'I’m really angry
 about it. Surely I’m due something for my commitment to Nando’s. I just
 wanted a small token so I was gutted when they gave me nothing.

'You
 always see Nando’s giving free stuff to celebrities and footballers but
 they never reward ordinary, loyal customers like me.'

Mr
 Holman said his ideal prize would be the much-celebrated ‘black card’, 
which guarantees free food for life at Nando’s and is rumoured to have 
been given to stars such as Beyonce, David Beckham and JLS, while singer
 Ed Sheeran and boxer David Haye have posted pictures online of their prized 'High Five' cards.

'If
 Nando’s gave me the black card, I’d get the image of the card tattooed 
on my left bum cheek to complete the look,' said Mr Holman.

Rebuffed: When Mr Holman, from Lower Kingswood, Surrey, contacted the company asking for a reward for his customer loyalty, his request was rebuffed

Response: Instead of the card, or a voucher, Mr Holman instead received an email stating: 'While we love your dedication to Peri Peri, we unfortunately can't give you a Black Card or a voucher'

Threat: Mr Holman replied to Nando's and said he would be inclined to turn to a rival chicken chain

Egged on: Mr Holman's friends encouraged him to get the tattoo after he told them he was craving Nando's food

'The staff can scan my behind when I come in to the restaurant.'

Instead of the card, or a voucher, Mr Holman instead received an email stating: 'While we love your dedication to Peri Peri, we unfortunately can't give you a Black Card or a voucher.'

Despite Nando’s ignoring his efforts, Mr Holman says he has no regrets about the inking. However he admits that his cheeky tattoo has received mixed reviews from the opposite sex.

'Some girls love it but others think I’m an idiot for having the tattoo. I don’t care though, they’re obviously not the right girl for me anyway.

'I always take girls out to Nando’s on a first date so it would be a nightmare if they didn’t like the restaurant.'

Nando’s was founded in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1987 and operates over 1,031 outlets in 24 countries. In 2012, the restaurant chain reported sales of £350million ($650m).

Fans: Rumoured Black Card holders JLS in a London branch of Nando's

Only openly acknowledged by Nando's in 2010, the chicken chain's fabled High Five card, or Black Card, is so prized as it grants its very select list of owners and their friends unlimited free meals at the restaurants.

Many owners are discreet about the cards, but celebrities including David Beckham, JLS, Ricky Gervais, Beyonce and Jay-Z, and even Oprah Winfrey are rumoured to have them.

Singer Ed Sheeran has posted a photograph where he proudly poses with a Black Card, and has written a song with rapper Example (who claims he was the first person to ever get a High Five card) - entitled Nando's Skank.

And asking for a card won't help fans of the chain to get their hands on them, as the company says anyone who has requested a card, 'no matter how politely', will ever receive one.

'Asking for one is simply the biggest taboo - a definite no no,' the chain states on its website in a post entitled 'High Five Card, Fact or Fiction'.

The website also states: 'You've heard rumours about it - a card that magically provides free Nando's for a whole year.

'The mythical Nando's High Five card - can you be sure it really exists? Or, like unicorns and Robin Hood, is it just a legend - one created by Nando's to give fans a holy grail to yearn for?'

When you consider that the average meal in Nando's costs around £10, including a bottomless soft drink, for a celebrity to eat there twice a month with five of their friends it would be worth around £1,200 a year.
