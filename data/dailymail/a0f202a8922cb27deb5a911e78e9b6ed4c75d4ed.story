Britain is preparing to reopen its embassy in Iran in a dramatic thawing of relations between the West and Tehran.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said the circumstances were right to restore the embassy, closed in 2011 after it was ransacked by an angry mob, insisting: 'Iran is an important country in a volatile region.'

In another dramatic development, US secretary of state John Kerry indicated that the Obama administration is 'open to discussions' with Tehran if the Iranians can help end the violence and restore confidence in the Iraqi government.

The need for closer working with Iran comes amid the deepening crisis in Iraq, where jihadist militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) have seized several major cities.

In a fresh worrying development, pictures have emerged of children taking up arms in Iraq against the Isis threatening to march on Baghdad.

Images coming out of Iraq today show youths brandishing automatic rifles as they march with the militias forming in the capital to fight back against the forces of ISIS.

The US has signalled it too could work with Iran in an extraordinary alliance to deal with the threat posed by the unrest in Iraq.

Mr Hague spoke to Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday when significant progress was made on repairing relations.

The Foreign Secretary stressed the ‘common interests’ with Iran, including stability in Iraq and in Afghanistan and tackling the drugs trade.

Anti Shah rioters in Tehran attack the British Embassy in December 1978

The British embassy in Tehran has long been the centre of tensions between the UK and Iran.

In November 2011, under hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency, Iran announced it was expelling the UK's ambassador in retaliation for British support for tougher sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme.

Hundreds of protesters stormed embassy compounds two days later, smashing windows, torching cars, burning Union Flags, and chanting: 'The embassy of Britain should be taken over',' and 'Death to England'.

The riots had echoes of an uprising in 1979 uprising when the pro-Western Pahlavi dynasty was deposed and replaced with a theocratic regime.

In 1980, six Iranian gunmen took 22 people hostage at the Iranian embassy in London. After a stand-off lasting six days, elite SAS troops stormed the building killing five gunmen and arresting another. One hostage was killed and two were injured.

It was eight years before the UK government re-opened its embassy in Tehran.

The rapprochement was short lived with diplomatic ties being severed again in 1989 when Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill British author Salman Rushdie in retaliation for his controversial novel The Satanic Verses. It took a decade for the embassy to be reopened.

Today he announced said the 'circumstances are right' to restore the diplomatic base after a significant thawing in relations over recent months.

'Our two primary concerns when considering whether to reopen our embassy in Tehran have been assurance that our staff would be safe and secure, and confidence that they would be able to carry out their functions without hindrance,' Mr Hague told MPs in a written statement.

'There has never been any doubt in my mind that we should have an embassy in Tehran if the circumstances allowed.

'Iran is an important country in a volatile region, and maintaining embassies around the world, even under difficult conditions, is a central pillar of the UK's global diplomatic approach...

'I have therefore now decided the circumstances are right to reopen our embassy in Tehran.'

However, the UK remains concerned about Iran's nuclear programme and its sponsorship of terrorism.

David Cameron later rejected the idea that the diplomatic rapprochement was connected to the crisis in Iraq.

Speaking at a press conference in Downing Street, he said: 'Britain believes in and I believe in step by step building our relationship with Iran because we need to have proper dialogue with that country.

'We are having dialogue over the nuclear weapons issue and I think we should be having dialogue with it on issues of regional security,' the premier said.

'Obviously our relationship was at a low point after the appalling things that happened with respect to our embassy, but it is right step by step with a clear eye with a hard head, to rebuild that relationship.

'Now we would be doing that anyway irrespective of what is happening in Iraq, but I think what is happening in Iraq is certainly not a reason for not taking that step.'  

It came amid reports that Tehran is considering military support to the Shia-led administration in Iraq.

Representatives of Iran and the Western powers met in Vienna to discuss international concerns about Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.

In the Commons yesterday, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘There is now an urgent case for ensuring an effective British diplomatic presence in Tehran to help co-ordinate discussions and to advance dialogue.’

Mr Hague said he had discussed 'a number of matters, including the situation in Iraq' with Iranian counterpart Mr Zarif.

Mr Hague spoke to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday to discuss taking further steps on improving bilateral relations

'He said that there was a case for a further step forward in our bilateral relations. 

'I have discussed that with him, and I shall have something more to say about our discussions imminently,' Mr Hague told MPs.

'However, our work on that is distinct from discussions on Iraq, which is partly why I shall address those separately.' 

Meanwhile, US secretary of state John Kerry has indicated that the Obama administration is willing to talk with Iran over the deteriorating security conditions in Iraq.

The president announced last night that around 275 US military personnel could deploy to Iraq to provide support and security for the US embassy and its staff in Baghdad.

Mr Kerry said in an interview with Yahoo! News that Washington is 'open to discussions' with Tehran if the Iranians can help end the violence and restore confidence in the Iraqi government.

He said he would not rule out military co-operation, and a senior US official revealed American and Iranian diplomats have already discussed the Iraq issue during nuclear talks in Austria.

Mr Kerry said: 'We're open to discussions if there is something constructive that can be contributed by Iran, if Iran is prepared to do something that is going to respect the integrity and sovereignty of Iraq and ability of the government to reform.'

On military co-operation, Mr Kerry said: 'At this moment, I think we need to go step-by-step and see what in fact might be a reality. But I would not rule out anything that would be constructive in providing real stability, a respect for the constitution, a respect for the election process and a respect for the ability of the Iraqi people to form a government that represents all the interests of Iraq.

'We are open to any constructive process here that would minimise the violence.'

But the Pentagon says it has no plans to co-ordinate with Iran on possible military action in Iraq despite Mr Kerry's comments about engagement with Tehran.

In a sign of Iran's deepening involvement in the Iraqi crisis, the Associated Press reported the commander of the country's elite Quds Force is helping Iraq's military and Shiite militias respond to the insurgency.

The Iranian general Ghasem Soleimani, has been consulting in Iraq on how to roll back the al Qaida breakaway group, according to Iraqi security officials.
