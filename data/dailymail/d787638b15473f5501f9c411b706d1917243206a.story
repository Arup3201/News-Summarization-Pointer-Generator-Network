Mothers at a Catholic primary school have been left outraged after a 'sexist and misogynistic' newsletter article was printed advising them to protect their marriages by getting rid of male friends.

St James Catholic Primary School in Brighton, east of Melbourne, included an article titled '15 Ways To Protect Your Marriage' at the back of its school newsletter on August 7.

The article, submitted by the school's parish priest Father Gerard Johnson, contained tips for wives to keep an eye on her husband's co-workers and being 'careful' on a girls night out.

It also suggested that couples should have complete access to each other's social media accounts and text messages.

A mother, only identified as Rachel, is seeking an apology from the school after the eldest of her two daughters came home and asked if she could no longer have male friends as suggested by the full-page newsletter article.

Rachel told Mamamia the article contained advice many parents would consider 'archaic'.

'Parents already feel let down by the Catholic Church by its inability to keep up with the times, but are now concerned that in 2014 our children are being educated in this sexist and misogynistic environment,' she said.

'Kids in years one and two are reading it. It’s just bonkers in our country, in this day and age.

'I just think it’s not lending itself to a modern-day relationship, which is about communication and trust. That’s taking us back to the dark ages.'

The article originally appeared on iMOM Family First and says porn is the 'cancer that's ruining the sex lives of countless married couples' and suggests married women should not talk about sex with members of the opposite sex.

Father Johnson told the Herald Sun he had received positive feedback, but it had been far outweighed by those who were upset by it.

'It was intended to be helpful, it clearly has not been,' he said.

But he 'utterly disagreed' that it was derogatory or sexist towards women.

The school's deputy principal, Pat Berlingeri, said Father Johnson had the final say about what was published in his section of the newsletter.
