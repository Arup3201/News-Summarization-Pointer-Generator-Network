Bernie Madoff has said that knowing the pain he inflicted on thousands through his Ponzi scheme is 'nothing' compared to the pain he feels over losing both of his sons.

In 2010, the fraudster's oldest son Mark killed himself, aged 46, on the second anniversary of his father's arrest for operating the largest financial fraud in history.

And last September, his remaining son, Andrew, passed away, aged 48, after battling cancer. 

'As difficult as it is for me to live with the pain I have inflicted on so many, there is nothing to compare with the degree of pain I endure with the loss of my son's Mark and Andy,' the 76-year-old wrote in an email from prison to NBC News.

Self pity: Bernie Madoff, pictured in January 2009, has written a letter from prison saying that knowing his victims' pain is nothing compared to the pain he feels over losing his two sons, who never forgave him

'I live with the knowledge that they never forgave me for betraying their love and trust. 

Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies.

But neither was ever criminally charged - and neither ever forgave him. 

'As much as I tried to reach out to them in an attempt to explain the circumstances that caused my betrayal they could not find it possible to forgive me. I do understand their unwillingness,' he wrote.

'The fact that I was trying to protect our family by sheltering them from any knowledge or involvement in my wrong doing still fails to allow me to forgive myself.'

He said that even though his sons were never charged in his scheme, they were the target for 'baseless and vindictive comments' and he is now committed to clearing their names.

Madoff sent NBC an email in response to claims his sons knew about his Ponzi scheme. Excerpts are below:

'As difficult as it is for me to live with the pain I have inflicted on so many, there is nothing to compare with the degree of pain I endure with the loss of my son's Mark and Andy. I live with the knowledge that they never forgave me for betraying their love and trust.

'As much as I tried to reach out to them in an attempt to explain the circumstances that caused my betrayal they could not find it possible to forgive me. I do understand their unwillingness.

'The fact that I was trying to protect our family by sheltering them from any knowledge or involvement in my wrong doing still fails to allow me to forgive myself.

'What is still my most important goal is to do everything in my power to protect their legacy, Although neither of my son's were ever charged with anything. They were subjected to the completely false and slanderous claims and remarks of the Trustee and the media vindictive comments of the above parties.'  

He insisted that the men, who both worked in different departments in his company, knew nothing of his scam and pointed out that civil lawsuits against his sons had been dismissed. 

Madoff was arrested on December 11, 2008, following his billion-dollar Ponzi scheme. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009 and is serving an 150-year sentence. 

The massive scheme was exposed after he told his sons about it and they contacted the FBI. 

Andrew told People magazine last year that turning his father in was 'at the same time the easiest decision I ever had to make and the hardest'. 

Struggling to deal with the revelations, Mark Madoff, hanged himself in his apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, as his two-year-old son was asleep in the room next door.

Speaking on the Today show in 2011, his mother Ruth Madoff revealed that the last time she had seen her son Mark alive was the evening her husband had revealed the scheme.

'I'll never get over that,' she said. 'I blame Bernie. It's the worst thing that can happen.'

Andrew Madoff, who first fought mantle cell lymphoma in 2003 and was diagnosed with the disease again in October 2012, also blamed his father.

In an interview last year, he said the stress of living with his father's arrest led to the relapse.

'One way to think of this is the scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' Andrew told People magazine in April 2013. 'And it's killing me slowly.'   

Although he reconciled with his mother, Ruth, shortly before his second diagnosis, he always said that he had no interest in having contact with his father.

'Even on my deathbed, I will never forgive him for what he did,' he told People magazine. 'He's already dead to me.'

The engaged father-of-two, who always denied knowing anything about his father's scheme, passed away at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York in September.
