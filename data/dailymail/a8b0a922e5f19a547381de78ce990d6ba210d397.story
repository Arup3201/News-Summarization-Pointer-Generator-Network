It has launched the careers of musical 
greats such as ABBA, Céline Dion and Michael Flatley, but the Eurovision Song Contest hasn't always hit the right notes on the sartorial song sheet.

With a bearded lady, a troupe of French rappers and a Bulgarian boyband among the entrants for this year's show, Eurovision looks set to be more entertaining than ever - although whether all will get it right on the night remains to be seen.

Just in case Britain's Molly Smitten-Downes and her competitors need any reminders of what not to do, FEMAIL has rounded up the very worst fashion disasters of the show in all their spangled, Lycra and Katie Price-filled glory. You're welcome.

Shine bright: Guildo Horn, a German Eurovision 
entrant in 1998,  brought his dusters along in case the stage was in need of a quick polish

You killed HOW many parrots? Israeli singer Dana International celebrates her victory in 1998 - but her tropical parrot inspired crop jacket wasn't so pretty

What would the Queen say? Britain's entry in the 2002, Jessica Garlick, makes the country 'proud' in her demure British attire

Not all white! Greece's entry for the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest, Sakis Rouvas, was keen to show off his freshly shaved chest and toned torso in his XS white T-shirt

Hair-raising attire! Ukraine's entry for the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest, Ruslana Lyzichko, second right, doesn't exactly blend into the crowd in her camouflage

Is tight really alright? Katie Price, left, and Javine, centre and right, went for cheap and cheerful when selecting their outfits - at least Katie opted for a low key hair shade

Tribal style: The 'Zdob shi Zdub' band from Moldova wear their table cloths to perform the song 'Boonika bate toba during the dress rehearsal in 2005

Heads! The lead singer of Norway's Wig Wam causes a safety hazard as he swings his microphone - at least it takes attention away from his leggings and feather boa

Monochrome madness: Luckily the Netherland's 2002 entry, Linda Wagenmakers, brought her tent along in case the local hotels were fully booked

Ghoulish: 2006's Finnish winners, Lordi, celebrate their victory in the Eurovision Song Contest... but seem to have scared off most of the audience

Dare to bare: So tight was the wardrobe budget some years, Fabrizio Faniello, left, from Malta, Moldova's representative Natalia Gordienko, centre, and Kreisiraadio, right, weren't offered real clothes and had to make do with treating the audience of European music fans to a performance in their underwear

Not so heavenly!  Elnur & Samir of Azerbaijan perform in 2008 in bizarre angel-inspired ensembles - complete with vast fluffy white wings

Hats off for effort!  'Zdob si Zdub' of Moldova perform in 2011 with ice cream cone (or Harry Potter) inspired headgear

If you're not Scottish, you can't pull it off! Greece's Koza Mostra, who performed with singer, Agathon Iakovidis, sported pleated kilts in last year's competition

That outfit is out of this world! Montenegro's Nina Žižić, left, performs in a bizarre spacesuit-inspired ensemble on last year's show, while Moldova's Aliona Moon, right, who also entered the Eurovision Song Contest last year, gets the audience all fired up in her Hunger Games inspired gown

What IS that all about? Ireland's Jedward performed at the contest two years running - and on both occasions, sported eye-wateringly silly outfits

Good luck! Britain's Molly Smitten-Downes hopes to win this year's event with Children of the Universe but Austria's Conchita Wurst (right) is the bookmaker's favourite
