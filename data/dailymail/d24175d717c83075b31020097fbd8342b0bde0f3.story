Roberto Martinez believes the introduction of a new division containing Premier League B teams is the perfect way to improve the fortunes of England's national side.

The Everton boss has backed the idea of League Three - a fifth tier consisting of young teams from top-flight clubs - which was suggested by FA chairman Greg Dyke following a commission into the failings of the Three Lions.

Despite opposition from some quarters, Martinez, who began his career playing for Real Zaragoza's second string, is convinced of the advantages that a Spanish style B team system would bring.

When asked whether Dyke's proposal could work in an interview with the Followtonians podcast, Martinez said: 'One hundred per cent.

'I first experienced B sides as a player. The B sides around France, Germany, Holland and Spain give the younger players an advantage. That's unfortunately where the English players are suffering when you go into European Championships and international games. You haven't got that first team experience.

'The B sides will work. The problem is how you're going to set it up and what parameters you're going to use. Young players need to play first team football, that's why we send our players out on loan and we see real benefits. 

'The problem is that you can't control their way of playing or how you want them to be educated towards playing in the first team. The B sides are the answer.'

Benefits: Martinez insists players need first-team football and that is why youngsters are currently loaned out

Under Dyke's initial plans, Premier League B teams would be allowed to play in the newly created League Three or the Conference. Promotion and relegation could be achieved across four divisions from League One downwards, although B teams would be restricted from making it up to the Championship and would not be permitted to play in the FA Cup.

Martinez, who has afforded English duo Ross Barkley, 20, and John Stones, 19, plenty of playing time this season, admits that the rules concerning a new B team system would be key to its effectiveness.

'Will it work? It would depend on the small details,' Martinez said. 

'What league is going to be set and whether promotion is going to be allowed. Are they going to play in cup competitions? Those minute details will be the difference between it being a success or not. 

'But in terms of the development of young players, it's exactly what we need.'

Former Brentford chairman Dyke has also expressed concerns about the amount of foreign players being granted work permits to play in England, with the commission recommending that those with non-EU visas should not be allowed to join clubs outside of the Premier League.

Martinez is less convinced by suggestions that signing non-English players is the problem, particularly given Everton's desire to compete at the highest level on a relatively modest budget.

He said: 'For us, it's about having good players. Whoever we sign in terms of the foreign market, Ross Barkley will play. 

'We need to produce good players, but good players from abroad can be positive influences. I'm not too keen about restricting numbers in that respect.'
