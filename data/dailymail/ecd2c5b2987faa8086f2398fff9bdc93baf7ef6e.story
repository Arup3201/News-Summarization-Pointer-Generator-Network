A dog owner has been left shocked and distraught after Idaho police shot dead his pet Labrador because it was barking in his van.

Craig Jones had left the dog, Arfee, in his van with a window rolled down while he had breakfast at a Coeur d'Alene coffee shop on Wednesday morning.

But an officer who approached the van a short while later shot the dog, which he described as a pit bull, over claims that it barked and had lunged at him.

Jones had been unaware of the incident until he left the coffee shop and was shown the bullet hole in his van window.

In an emotional post on Facebook, Jones wrote: 'This cop left a hole in both of [us] that can't be fixed. If it wasn't for my desire to face him in court and strip him of his badge. I would probably be at the bottom of the lake with my boy "Arfee".'

He told KREM that he was still in shock from losing the two-year-old dog he had raised from a pup.

'He goes everywhere with me. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body,' Jones said, as he said he struggled to believe claims by police that their officer felt under threat.

The police had been called to the 
parking lot by the owner of a cafe, who said Jones' vehicle looked 
similar to one involved in suspicious activity.

Good natured: Jones said his dog didn't have a mean bone in his body

The neighborhood had been on alert for a white van similar to the one driven by Jones after reports of a driver approaching young children.

Jones and his vehicle are not in any way suspected of being involved in that case.

A police spokesman said the officer, who has not been identified, approached the van with his weapon drawn because he believed there may be a threat.

The officer who shot Arfee was said to be very upset by the incident.

Coeur d'Alene police have not yet responded to a Mail Online request for comment.
