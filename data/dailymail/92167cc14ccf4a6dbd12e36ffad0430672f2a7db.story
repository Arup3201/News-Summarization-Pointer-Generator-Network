The families of many police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, are in hiding or running from town amid death and assault threats.

One police wife told KTVI that she's received threats over the phone and she's been paranoid for her and her young daughter's safety ever since.

'Did they follow me here?' she told the station. 'Did I do a good enough job after work today of taking different routes, on my way home?

Tensions are rising in Ferguson as a grand jury decides whether to charge white Officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18.

In one recent message, a caller says: 'Would you rather hear me coming out, coming out and robbing your house? And it would be like, it'd just be like silence man, you couldn't hear nothing.' 

'It's very frightening,' said the police wife, who asked to not be identified.

'Most people who have a family member who's a police officer are very proud of what they do.'

She added: 'This is real and people actually do know how to find us and they do want to harm us.'

The police wife says some officers' relatives have been leaving town to protect themselves — but she plans on staying.

'I'm very worried about what's going to happen to the citizens and what's going to happen to the businesses and what's going to happen to the police officers,' she told KTVI. 

'This is a good community with a long history and they love their community.'

Anger in Ferguson remained high on Thursday as Wilson said he is 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury

Meanwhile, about a dozen protesters gathered again outside the police station in Ferguson in frigid conditions Thursday night, sometimes blocking vehicles as they waved placards and chanted 'Whose streets? Our streets!' and 'Killer cops have got to go!'

Officers in helmets and shields were deployed after a commander told protesters not to block traffic.

Brief scuffles broke out and at least one woman and a man were handcuffed and taken away.

Police did not confirm an official tally. The Chicago Tribune reported at least six were arrested. 

The August 9 killing of Brown triggered weeks of sometimes violent protests demanding Wilson be indicted. Tensions continued on Thursday and required police in riot gear to keep the peace (pictured)

Wilson's camp has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department.

Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the shooting.

'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said.

Meanwhile, Wilson may announce as early as Friday his plans to resign from the force, as a way of protecting fellow officers and easing pressures in the wake of the shooting.

The victim's father, Michael Brown Sr., has released a public service announcement appealing for calm and non-violence among those who might protest, saying that 'hurting others is not the answer.'

He also takes a moment to thank many of the protesters for 'lifting [their] voices to end racial profiling and police intimidation.'

'No matter what the grand jury decides, I do not want my son’s death to be in vain,' Brown said.

'I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone.
