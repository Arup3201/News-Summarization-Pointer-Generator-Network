Gem stone fraudster John Bishop, 32, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, was jailed today for four years

A gem dealer who conned pensioners into parting with their life savings to buy coloured diamonds as an 'investment' at hugely inflated prices was jailed for four years today.

John Bishop, 32, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, was part of a team of five fraudsters who cold called thousands of elderly people to persuade them to buy brightly coloured stones as via their company No1 Gems.

The victims, mostly retirees registered with investment companies, were sent glossy brochures and promised massive returns on gems which, they were told, HSBC bank had agreed to buy the entire stock of for £15million. 

In fact, the stones had been bought in bulk from a diamond catalogue and given a huge mark up in the No1 Gems brochure.

The year-long scheme was masterminded by Bishop's friend Adam Simmons, 28, who set up an office in Hove, East Sussex.

Bishop was put in charge of the office in Marbella, Spain, and tasked with pulling in Brits who had retired to the Costa del Sol.

The Old Bailey heard how No1 Gems was set up in late 2011 and conned a total of £1million from investors until it was raided by police in September the following year. 

Bishop, who was arrested in October 2012 after returning to Britain from Spain, had denied all knowledge of the scam, but was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and transferring criminal property after a trial at the Old Bailey.

Prosecutor David Durose said during the trial: 'Basically No1 Gems were engaged in what is known as a boiler room fraud.

'It is a specific type of fraud in which individuals are targeted with cold calling and pressured into making purchase of items such as shares, equities or financial instruments - or in this case, diamonds.

'They marked up the price by eight, ten or even up to nearly 30 times'.

One victim, William Doorbar, a retiree from Stoke, Staffordshire, agreed to buy a 0.26 carat green diamond, worth just ££50, for £5,598 after being told he could make annual returns of more than 20per cent. 

Mr Durose said it was not clear if Bishop had known from the outset that the company was a con, as he had sent Simmons an email in April 2012 saying "These prices are getting a bit ridiculous".

But he said that by June he definitely did know, and may have known before then. 

Richard Furlong, defending Bishop, said: 'He was drawn in by Mr Simmons. 

'He was in a position where he was living in Spain, he needed a job, the economic circumstances in that part of Spain were not very good.

He claimed Bishop was only responsible for a total loss of £70,000 to investors because he was less closely involved than the others and for a shorter period, but the prosecution claimed the figure was £600,000.

Sentencing him to four years in prison, Judge Andrew Lees said: 'You claimed you did not know of the dishonesty of Adam Simmons and that's the position that you maintain today.

'Having heard the evidence and having heard your evidence I have no hesitation in rejecting this assertion by the defence.

'I am sure your knew of this fraudulent activity...

'You concealed your identity from the customers, you gave a false name throughout and you concealed the fact that you were working from an office outside the UK.' 

Judge Lees said he accepted that Bishop was responsible for a total loss of around £600,000.

Bishop, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent trading between 31 October 2011 and 10 September 2012 and transferring criminal property.

He was cleared of fraudulent trading at the direction of the judge.

The rest of his gang were jailed last September having been found guilty of fraud charges.

Adam Simmons, of Liverpool,  was sentenced to six years for conspiracy to defraud, money laundering, and fraudulent trading, while his father, Michael Simmons, 54, of Stone Cross, Pevensey, East Sussex, got two and a half years and Adam Leach, 30, of Eastbourne, four years for the same charges.

Their accomplice Lee Miller, 33, of Bexhill on Sea, was jailed for three years, four months after he admitted a single count of fraudulent trading.  

A proceeds of crime act hearing has been scheduled for 19 December to determine how much the fraudsters will pay back.
