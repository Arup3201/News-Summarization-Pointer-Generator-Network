These sepia photographs, believed to be some of the first to depict iconic Scottish landmarks and characters from the 1800s, are expected to sell for tens of thousands of pounds this month.

The work of David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson, who were the creators of Scotland's first photographic studio, they date back 170 years to the early 1840s.

Included are some of the earliest photographs of Edinburgh, including John Knox House and the Scott Monument when it was still under construction. There are also photographs of Mr Adamson's home town, St Andrews, in Fife.

These photographs, by David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson, showing St Andrews Castle fore tower (left) and John Knox House, Edinburgh, are some of the oldest images of Scotland and date back to the 1840s

This photograph, taken on North Street, St Andrews, shows women and children baiting fishing lines

An image of the Abbey Wall in St Andrews is in the collection, which is to be auctioned at Bonhams in London

Now caught on camera many times each day, these sites may never have been photographed before these images were taken.

The collection includes pictures of a sergeant and private of the Gordon Highlanders at Edinburgh Castle.

And there are also portraits of central figures of the First General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland, which Mr Hill used to create his famous painting of the event. This was believed to be the world's first work of art painted with the help of photographs.

The 17 pictures will be sold at Bonhams in London on November 12, when experts believe they could soar beyond their £20,000 estimate.

Matthew Haley, head of books and historic photographs at Bonhams, said: 'Hill and Adamson were among the world's first professional photographers, and these are among the first photographs.

'Edinburgh and St Andrews are particularly lucky to have been documented at this early stage, when photography was in its infancy.

'Hill and Adamson were breaking new ground.'

Then and now: Bonaly Tower is pictured many times each day now, but this shot (left) was one of the first

He added: 'The image of fishwives in St Andrews baiting their lines is fabulous. It is designed to look like a snapshot in time, but actually it would have been carefully staged.

'The people in these pictures may never have seen a photograph before. They had no conception of how important they were.

'The market for 19th century photographs is truly international. There is a huge market for early photography in America, the Middle East and beyond.

'We have valued them at around £20,000 but we might see fireworks.'

The set also features a Sergeant and Private of the 42nd Gordon Highlanders by a canon at Edinburgh Castle taken in 1846 before the regiment moved to Ireland.

For their photograph of the Scott Monument in construction in 1844, they hoisted themselves and their equipment on to the roof of what is now the Royal Scottish Academy to get a clear view.

The set also includes photographs of clergymen present at the Disruption Assembly in 1843 when more than 450 ministers walked out of the Church of Scotland assembly and down to another Edinburgh assembly hall to found the Free Church of Scotland.

Mr Hill, who was present at the historic event, decided to record the dramatic scene and used photography to get likenesses of all the ministers present.

The photographs - salt paper prints from caloype negatives - include the central figure, Rev Dr Thomas Chalmers, the leader of the Free Church of Scotland, dubbed Scotland's greatest 19th century churchman.

The photographs are salt paper prints from caloype negatives and are estimated to sell for around £20,000

Photographs of St Andrews include the fore tower of the castle, the abbey wall, the entrance to the cathedral precinct and South Street with W Smith's chemist shop and the town church.

Mr Haley said: 'Photographs are inherently fragile, and examples from the 1840s are very rare, particularly in such fine condition.

'They have not been displayed or exposed to the light, and may have been in an envelope for the last 150 years.

'Had they been mounted and framed the images might almost be invisible now.

'For so many to become available together is unusual.'

The relationship between Mr Hill and Mr Adamson ended in 1848 when the latter man died

Perth-born painter Mr Hill joined St Andrews engineer Mr Adamson in 1843 to form Scotland's first photographic studio.

They produced 'the first substantial body of self-consciously artistic work using the newly invented medium of photography'.

Their brief partnership ended with Mr Adamson's death in 1848, though Mr Hill continued to photograph and paint, completing his painting of the Disruption Assembly in 1866. He died in 1870 aged 67.
