A star count shows how many areas of Britain are cut off from seeing some of the most spectacular constellations in the sky

Half of Britain cannot see a starry sky at night because of light pollution, a study has found.

Glaring beams from streetlamps, shops and offices are creating an artificially bright landscape, says the Campaign to Protect Rural England.

It found 53 per cent of us could see fewer than ten stars in the Orion constellation – slightly fewer than last year.

Campaigners said that despite initiatives to reduce light pollution ‘the contamination of British night skies continues largely unchecked’.

Together with the British Astronomical Association, they are calling for a reduction in light pollution which not only thwarts stargazers, but affects wildlife and human sleeping patterns.

The research was carried out by around 1,000 volunteers who counted the stars they could see on a clear night in January and February.

Just 2 per cent had truly dark skies, seeing 31 or more stars - concentrated in rural spots in the South West, West Midlands and Cumbria.

Orion is one of the most easily recognisable constellations in the world and visible in Britain from November to February.

Emma Marrington, of the CPRE, said unnecessary light ‘damages the character of the countryside’.

She added: ‘Of course we need the right, well-designed lighting in the right places…but there should not be a blanket assumption that glaring lights are needed.’

‘The evidence gathered during this year’s star count week shows that we need to take action now to roll back the spread of light pollution.’

And she warned: ‘When we saturate the night sky with unnecessary light, it damages the character of the countryside and blurs the distinction between town and country.

The Local Government Association said dozens of local authorities had been trialling the dimming of street lights at night.

Bob Mizon of the Campaign for Dark Skies, said: ‘Light pollution is a disaster for anyone trying to study the stars. It’s like a veil of light is being drawn across the night sky, denying many people the beauty of a truly starry night.

‘Many children growing up today will never see the Milky Way; never see the unimaginable glory of billions of visible stars shining above them.’

A spokesman from the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘New national planning rules provide strong protection against light pollution.

‘The national planning framework makes clear that councils should limit the impact of light pollution from artificial light when making planning decisions.
