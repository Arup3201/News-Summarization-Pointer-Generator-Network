She only gave birth to her first daughter seven months ago, but Tamara Ecclestone is back to her glamorous self. So what's her secret?

The Formula One heiress, who welcomed daughter Sophia with husband Jay Rutland in March, shared her  beauty regime with Get The Gloss.

Judging by her father's fortunes, it comes as little surprise that Tamara lives a life privilege and unparalleled luxury. But, proving that she's just like the rest of us, the 30-year-old revealed that even she dreaded stretch marks in the run up to giving birth and is 'too lazy' to wash her hair daily.

Beauty secrets: Tamara Ecclestone, who took her newborn daughter Sophia to the Frieze Art Fair preview yesterday, has revealed the beauty products that keep her looking glossy

Speaking about her beauty regime, she cites Mama Mio's £45 Goodbye Stretch Mark Cream as one of her essential products.

She said: 'I have been using this religiously, I have been lubing up my whole body with it hoping not to get stretch marks and I have to say, so far so good, so I feel this works for me.'

And the svelte star, who has reclaimed her trim pre-pregnancy body, added: 'I want to enjoy my time with the baby but obviously I want to be healthy and do some exercise because it makes you feel good, as well as look good.'

Opening up her makeup bag, which is Louis Vuitton, of course, Tamara cites Clinique's CC cream as her number one beauty buy, explaining: 'I never used to wear SPF, how bad! I used to lay in the sun and fry. So whenever I go anywhere warm, I like to have SPF on.'

She also loves NARS Lipstick in Barbarella, and says she can 'more or less' apply  it with her eyes closed.

She keeps her hair glossy using her very own range of products, SHOW Beauty. She said: 'I am way too lazy to wash my hair every day so I absolutely swear by my dry shampoo. It's a cute bottle so you'd want to whip it out and show it off and it smells like dessert.'

Other beauty essentials in her cosmetics bag include a Tangle Teezer, Charlotte Tilbury mascara, and a Kiehl's lip balm. 'I probably have about 50 lip glosses floating around,' she added.

She also swears by Dermalogica moisturiser, explaining: 'I am so particular about moisturisers. I used to have such bad skin as a teenage and I refused to moisturise because I thought it would give me more spots but that's a complete myth.'

Sharing her ultimate beauty and wellness tips, she concludes: 'It sounds ridiculous but honestly, I think sleep is really important, lots of water, and not too many heavy nights - I think it shows, especially on a woman, if you've been partying too hard.'

Now everyone can get the glamorous star's look as she gets ready to expand the haircare brand she founded last year by adding a chain of blow-dry bars - Show Dry - across the UK, Ireland and United Arab Emirates.

The new mother has been working on the salons for 12 months and says they will take cues from the luxurious feel of sumptuous interiors, the service of sleek designer boutiques and exclusivity of private members clubs for a 'truly integrated experience.'

Speaking about her new venture, 30-year-old Tamara said: 'Show Beauty was conceptualised to offer people a unique and opulent alternative, superior to anything they have tried before, and therefore Show Dry is a perfect natural extension of the brand. 

'As a working wife and new mother I know how hard it is to look and feel great when you don’t have much time and Show Dry aims to provide a slick, time efficient service that allows all women the time to feel fabulous no matter how much time you "don’t have".'

The socialite has taken every last detail into consideration and for someone with a taste for the finer things in life, you can expect iPads, flexible opening hours, valet parking, exclusive loyalty programmes, a  healthy menu, and even a personal driver service to protect newly styled hair.

Despite the swanky surroundings, getting your hair styled a la Tamara will only set you back between £18-£45. 

Tamara and her team have plans to introduce further concessions across the UK, including the full Harvey Nichols portfolio as well as Fenwicks and House of Fraser over the next twelve months.
