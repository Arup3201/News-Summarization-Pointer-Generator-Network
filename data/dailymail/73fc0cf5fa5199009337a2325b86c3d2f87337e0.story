Pig, a half-dog that was born with significant physical issues, has found a loving owner in Alabama.

Owner Kim Dillenbeck adopted Pig during a trip to Atlanta to see her sister, she told Al.com.

'I met some of her neighbors who came over for Christmas breakfast, and after hearing about Pig, we all went to her house,' Dillenbeck said.

'Pretty quickly, I decided to be her mother because she probably wouldn't live,' Dillenbeck told Al.com. 'We assumed that by now, she would be suffocating under her own organs, or something like that, because of her shape.'

Pig, who was born in the wild, was taken in along with her sisters by a woman who heard her barking, Al.com reported.

Dillenbeck told Al.com Pig has multiple health issues, including missing ribs, incorrectly rotated joints, and damaged vertebrae.

Despite her size as a 'half-dog,' Pig, who is 8 months old months old, could still get bigger.

'She's not fully grown,' Dillenbeck told Al.com. 'She's still gaining weight. At this point, she has the potential to gain another 20 pounds, and that would probably kill her.'

Though Dillenbeck said she is not sure about Pig's future, she's happy to have her in her life.

'I'm the lucky one. She makes me laugh every day,' she said.
