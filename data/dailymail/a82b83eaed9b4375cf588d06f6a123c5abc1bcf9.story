A parliamentary aide who claims to have had gay sex with honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani is expected to give evidence at his trial.

The unnamed adviser – said to mix in high circles at Westminster – allegedly met the millionaire businessman at The Hoist gay nightclub in London.

He is understood to have had sex with him on several occasions and claimed that Dewani was a ‘submissive’ who enjoyed dressing up in leather. Sources have confirmed the aide is scheduled to appear at Cape Town’s Western Cape High Court next week as a prosecution witness. 

Trial: Shrien Dewani on the stand in South Africa where he has admitted being bisexual and to using male prostitutes. Today it was revealed that a British parliamentary aide is expected to give evidence

Dewani is accused of orchestrating the murder of his 28-year-old wife Anni in a staged carjacking on their honeymoon four years ago

Dewani, 34, is accused of orchestrating the murder of his 28-year-old wife Anni Dewani in a staged carjacking during their honeymoon four years ago.

As his trial opened this week, he dramatically admitted to being bisexual and having sex with male prostitutes and men he had met online and in clubs.

The aide, who lives in London, is understood to have come forward after Dewani’s then spokesman, Max Clifford, denied that he was gay in the weeks after the murder.

He first met Dewani 11 years ago when the care home tycoon was in his early 20s.

Dewani was said to be well known on the London gay scene and often attended Hoist in Vauxhall, south London, which has a ‘strictly enforced’ dress code consisting of leather, uniform, rubber and other fetish clothing. The aide is said to have talked to officers from Scotland Yard who passed the information on to the South African authorities.

Male escort Leopold Leisser – who is nicknamed the ‘German Master’, is also expected to testify at the Dewani’s trial

Male escort Leopold Leisser – who is nicknamed the ‘German Master’ – is also expected to testify at Dewani’s trial.

He is said to have had sex with Dewani three times during his courtship of Mrs Dewani.

Leisser has said that Dewani liked to be humiliated and racially abused.

Mrs Dewani’s cousin, Sneha Hindocha, has told police that Dewani spurned the sexual advances of his fiancée when they were engaged.

Mrs Dewani was left feeling ‘embarrassed and hurt’ by his actions, she said in a statement made to Scotland Yard detectives and passed on to South African prosecutors.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo was earlier jailed for 18 years in South Africa after admitting his role in the killing of Mrs Dewani in November 2010.

The two hitmen, Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe, are also serving prison sentences.

The trial continues.
