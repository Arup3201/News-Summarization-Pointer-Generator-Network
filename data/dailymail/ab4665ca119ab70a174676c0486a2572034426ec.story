Spain's national training centre for football coaches says it has lodged an official complaint with the country's federation over Zinedine Zidane coaching Real Madrid's reserve team without having the required qualifications.

Miguel Galan, president of the centre, said that the complaint was presented on August 28. He said he was told on Friday that Spain's federation has given Madrid 10 days to present its response.

Madrid announced in June that Zidane, who played for the club from 2001 until retiring in 2006, would coach its B team this season.

Zidane served as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant with the first team in 2013.

Galan said it would set a bad example if Madrid was allowed to hire unqualified people as coaches.
