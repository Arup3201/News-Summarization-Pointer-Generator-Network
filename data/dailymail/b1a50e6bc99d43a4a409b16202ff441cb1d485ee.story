Pro-Russian separatists have intensified shelling on Ukrainian government forces as world leaders try to hammer out a desperate peace deal to calm violence in the embattled country.

Seven civilians and five Ukrainian troops were killed during fighting in eastern Ukraine today - and at least 26 soldiers have been injured - government and rebel officials confirmed.

A recent upsurge in violence has forced France and Germany's leaders to intervene - in a bid to broker a new peace treaty between warring sides.

But there is no guarantee the talks will work, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told an international security conference in Munich today.

Supplies: Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko has called for more weapons to be sent to his country

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande - who have visited both Ukraine and Russia's capitals this week - are trying to strike a desperate deal to end the fighting.

The two leaders plan to discuss the proposals, which could include greater autonomy for the separatists' eastern region, in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tomorrow.

Speaking to France 2 television, Hollande said the plan being negotiated would feature a 50 to 70km demilitarised zone being established.

He called for 'rather strong' autonomy in the east, adding: 'These people have gone to war... It will be difficult to make them share a common life.'

Their aim is to draw up a joint agreement to enforce a peace treaty signed in Belarus in September, which has been violated by both sides. 

Merkel said today: 'This conflict cannot be resolved by military means. It is all the more important now to set out substantial steps that serve to fill with life the Minsk agreement.'

Asked whether there are any guarantees any new agreement will not suffer the same fate as the last one, she replied that 'there are no theoretical guarantees' but says it is 'worth making this attempt'.

She added: 'After such experiences, I am very cautious with guarantees. The guarantee can only be keeping to what has been agreed... but the answer can't be not to make any more agreements. Of course we have to try again and again.'

'Frozen': Poroshenko has said he wants a quick end to the fighting - saying it must be resolved and not 'frozen'

Troubled: Poroshenko said there was 'no temporary solution' and his country stands ready for a 'comprehensive and immediate ceasefire'

However, Poroshenko has pushed for a quick ceasefire in his country's troubled east, insisting that the conflict must be resolved and not 'frozen', while pressing Kiev's case to be supplied with defensive weapons. 

Poroshenko told the Munich Security Conference that Ukraine stands ready for a "comprehensive and immediate ceasefire" and Russia should be too.

He indicated he did not want any peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine, saying they would not be needed if foreign fighters were withdrawn and the Ukraine-Russia border sealed. Then, he said, there would be 'peace and stability in Ukraine ... within a couple of weeks'.

'There is no temporary solution - this conflict must be resolved, not frozen,' he added, alluding to long-time conflicts involving breakaway regions in Georgia and Moldova. 

Ready: Poroshenko said he hoped Russia, and Putin, were also ready to bring an end to the fighting

Co-operate: Putin said Russia was ready to co-operate with international efforts to bring peace to the region

Borders:  Poroshenko has said he does not want any peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine - but does want the border with Russia sealed

Putin, meanwhile, stressed Russia's aim was to co-operate.

At a trade union congress in the resort city of Sochi came, Putin said: 'We don't intend to war with anyone. We intend to cooperate with all.'

But he complained of 'attempts to hold back our development by various means'. 

Afterwards, Putin was pictured looking relaxed at a celebration marking the first anniversary of the opening of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games.

War: The UN estimates over 5,000 people have died as a result of fighting in Ukraine since last April

War torn: Pro-Russian separatists (pictured) are thought to have killed over one thousand government troops 

More than 5,300 people have been killed since fighting began in April according to the UN, and the bloodshed has markedly increased over the past two weeks prompting another desperate plea for diplomacy. 

Separatist forces appear to be amassing on the eastern town of Debaltseve, which lies between two major rebel-controlled regions, and the coastal city of Mariupol, which has already seen heavy bombing. 

Reports from Debaltseve yesterday said Ukrainian forces laid down mortar and howitzer fire from the town during an operation to evacuate civilians.

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said he 'sincerely' hopes this latest diplomatic effort will produce results but warned against arming Kiev's troops - and blamed the United States and Europe for inflaming the crisis.

Bombing: The recent increase in violence and shelling of enemy areas in Ukraine has forced German and French leaders to try and broker another peace deal

Following talks between the Russian, French and German leaders on Friday, he said: 'We believe that there are good grounds for optimism, to issue recommendations for conflict resolution. 

Speaking during a debate at a security conference in Munich, he also pointed to growing calls in the West to 'pump Ukraine full of lethal weapons.'

He added: 'This position will only exacerbate the tragedy of Ukraine.'

'I am sure that Russia will be among those parties that will guarantee the implementation of this agreement. But you can only guarantee what has already been achieved.'

Both the United States and other Western countries claim Russia has supplied troops and equipment to the separatists in eastern Ukraine, which Russia has denied.

The recent resurgence in fighting has prompted the US to consider giving lethal weapons to Ukraine.

But European nations fear the move will simply make the situation worse.

Angela Merkel said: 'The problem is that I cannot imagine any situation in which improved equipment for the Ukrainian army leads to President Putin being so impressed that he believes he will lose militarily.' 

Merkel held a three-way meeting with Poroshenko and US Vice President Joe Biden after her appearance at the conference.

US Secretary of State John Kerry also was in Munich for the annual gathering of foreign and security policy leaders.
