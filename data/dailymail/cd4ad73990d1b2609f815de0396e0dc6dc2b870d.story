Authorities say LaVera performed a sex act on a 14-year-old girl. According to court documents, the 33-year-old admitted to police that he touched the teen on her private parts.

He is also accused of using a smartphone to record a 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old taking a shower and using the bathroom. The lewd videos were then uploaded onto LaVera’s laptop, the complaints said.

Court documents alleged that the 33-year-old pretender reached out to a 14-year-old girl on Facebook, telling her he was a Twilight star and asking her to meet him at Berg Junior High and Maytag Park, The Des Moines Register reported.

In one message, the suspect instructed the girl not to wear underwear to their meeting, the complaint revealed.

Posing as an actor, LaVera gained access to teenage girls by visiting two schools in Newton, where he signed autographs, posed for photos with students and performed martial arts tricks in the cafeteria.

A grainy video obtained by WHO-TV shows the 33-year-old doing back-flips in the lunchroom of Berg Middle School.

That is where LaVera allegedly met Raven Adams in June and arranged a meeting with her and a friend in the park.

The girl planned to stay at a friend's and sneak out to meet him but her mother found out and called the police in Newton.

Raven told USA Today at the time: 'They didn't do anything about it. If they had, I don't think this would have happened to this other girl.'

After the girl's mother, Tammy Adams, contacted the police, an officer found LaVera at a bar and gave him a verbal warning but did not arrest him. He was allegedly signing autographs and taking pictures with his 'fans' at the time. 

LaVera, of San Diego, 
was arrested a week later for inappropriately touching a 14-year-old girl and driving off with her while posing as Kiowa Gordon, 24, who played minor character Embry in three Twilight films. The teen was returned to her family unharmed.

LaVera was arrested on Tuesday after he allegedly inappropriately touched a different girl and drove off with her. The girl was returned to her family unharmed.

After the teen was safely out of LaVera's vehicle, he sped away. Sheriff's deputies caught up with him a short time later. In his car, they found two swords and four daggers.

He had chatted with the girl over Facebook before driving 26 hours from California to Iowa to meet her.

Mother Tammy Adams said that prior to this incident, LaVera also tried the same moves on her teenage daughter Raven on June 3.

Ms Adams told USA Today that LaVera told her daughter he was the Twilight star and convinced her and a friend to go to a park with him, where he touched her inappropriately.

The 33-year-old allegedly asked the teenager if they could meet up at night to make out.

Confession: LaVera admitted to inappropriately touching a 14-year-old girl, who told police the man performed a sex act on her without her consent

The girl planned to stay at a friend's and sneak out to meet him but her mother found out and called the police in Newton.

Raven told USA Today: 'They didn't do anything about it. If they had, I don't think this would have happened to this other girl.'

After Tammy Adams contacted the police, an officer found LaVera at a bar and gave him a verbal warning but did not arrest him. He was allegedly signing autographs and taking pictures with his 'fans' at the time. 

Newton Lt. Bill Henninger described LaVera as 'a wolf dressed in sheep's clothing who children would gravitate to.'

Lt. Henninger said that he believed LaVera had been staying in Newton with family. Concerned citizens had called the police department to report seeing LaVera in town with other children, both male and female.

He said that he believed that LaVera had been introducing himself both by his real name but had convinced others, in particular groups of teenagers, that he was Kiowa Gordon and signing autographs in his name.

Raven Adams met the actor at her school on May 28 where he was brought by a parents of a student.

He was introduced to students as David LaVera, a stuntman from California, before he signed autographs and performed stunts at assembly.

On May 29, Raven Adams posted a pictured with the actor on her Facebook page. In the comments below, when asked who he was, she wrote: 'A guy that plays in twilight... he played embry call.'

One commenter wrote: 'And have you looked at a picture of embry from the movie... just looks diff.'

The teen replied: 'He is older it was like 5 and six years ago and he is a stunt double he filled in for the kne who broke his legs he was young tho.'

She added: 'He came to the school he is a family friend of a students his parents met him somewhere and they became really good friends.'
