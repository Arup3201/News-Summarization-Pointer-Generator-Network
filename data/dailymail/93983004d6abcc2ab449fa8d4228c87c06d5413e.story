Tragic: Sam Boon died in extreme heat during a school expedition to Morocco in July 2012

A teenager who collapsed in extreme heat during a school expedition to Morocco died as a result of misadventure, a coroner has ruled.

Samuel Boon, 17, fell to the ground in front of classmates on a five-day trek in temperatures of 120F (49C) in July 2012.

The 6ft 2in teenager was taken to hospital by minibus, where he was sadly pronounced dead.

Now, south London coroner Selena Lynch has criticised the trek leaders - claiming they were 'inexperienced' and 'lacking in local knowledge'.

Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, she said: 'The cause of Samuel’s death was contributed to by his obesity
 and lack of fitness and acclimatisation.

'These
 risk factors and his tiredness and obvious difficulty in keeping up 
with the trek were not fully recognised by the leaders, who were 
inexperienced and lacking in local knowledge.'

Samuel, who weighed 20 stone, collapsed at around 3.30pm on July 17, 2012, while trekking in Amezmiz, in the foothills of the High Atlas mountains, the inquest in Bromley, south east London, heard.

He 'quickly became unconscious', yet it took more than an hour for an emergency vehicle to arrive - and when it did, it was a minibus, rather than a fully equipped ambulance.

When Samuel
 eventually reached a medical centre, he was pronounced dead.

'Samuel was carried to the road where it was noted that his breathing had ceased,' said Mrs Lynch.

'Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed by the leaders and Samuel was placed in the aisle of the minibus.

'By this time it was probable that Samuel’s life could not have been saved even with advanced medical treatment.'

She added: 'Plans 
for evacuation relied almost entirely upon local agents to find and 
obtain appropriate facilities.

'They were appointed 
without their qualifications being checked or references obtained, and 
were not given any formal training.

Devastating: Before the trip, Samuel had been prescribed the drug DesmoMelt for bed-wetting

'There
 were no arrangements in place for an ambulance with medical equipment 
and/or personnel to be provided in an emergency, and the facilities at 
local medical centres had not been assessed.'

Eleven pupils from Bexley Business Academy in south east London went on the trip, and had raised funds to support the expedition, the inquest heard. 

The itinerary was to include a few days helping to build a school.

The students had been due to work on a rural project for seven days after the trek, but the trip was cut short after Samuel died.

At the time of his death, temperatures in the region were reported to have risen as high as 49C.

Before the expedition, Samuel's 
parents had been given 'inadequate and misleading' information about the
 level of fitness required on the trip, as wells as the risks involved, said Mrs Lynch.

'Samuel was not adequately assessed as to his physical ability to participate,' she said.

The teenager had also been prescribed the drug DesmoMelt for bed-wetting, which he had taken with him to Morocco. 

Recording the verdict, Mrs
 Lynch said the cause of Samuel’s death was either exertional heatstroke
 and/or hyponatremia - a condition where salt levels are reduced in the 
blood, caused by excessive intake and/or retention of water.

She
 said the teenager, who lived in Abbey Wood, south east London, may have taken DesmoMelt in the 'recent past', which can cause or contribute to hyponatremia.

However, she added it was not possible to
 determine whether he did so - and if so, whether it contributed to his death.

Speaking after the inquest, Samuel's parents criticised the company, World Challenge, which organised the trip.

Ken
 Boon said he would never have allowed 
his son to go on the expedition if he had known about the arrangements for emergency care.

'If
 we had known that in an emergency there would have been no helicopter, 
no ambulance, no medic - in fact, the best emergency response available 
was a mini-bus with no medical assistance - we would never have allowed 
Sam to go, he said.  

'In fact I don’t think there is any school in the country that would go.'

In a statement after the inquest, Matt
 Eastlake, managing director of World Challenge, said: 'Samuel Boon’s death was an absolute tragedy and our 
deepest sympathies remain with his family and friends.

'World
 Challenge’s highest priority is the safety of its participants and as 
the coroner noted, we have introduced a number of new measures since 
Samuel’s death, especially in terms of monitoring participant fitness.

'We
 will take time to reflect on the coroner’s findings and give serious 
consideration to any change or development where we feel appropriate 
which will improve safety further.

He added: 'We have worked hard over the last 26 years to 
develop an excellent reputation for our approach to safety and how we 
operate.

'Our policies and 
procedures reflect industry good practice and comply with the British 
Standard for Overseas Expeditions and Fieldwork (BS 8848) and Learning 
Outside the Classroom (LOtC).'
