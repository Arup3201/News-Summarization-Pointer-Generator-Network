A disabled pizza chef is suing his county council for tens of thousands of pounds after his false leg snapped off and became embedded in his stump after he fell into a gigantic pothole.

Stephen Strassen was on his way to his corner shop when he tripped into the 2ft deep crater outside his Lincolnshire home, which had opened up after weeks of heavy rain.

The 52-year-old’s prosthetic left leg, which he uses after his limb was amputated following a car crash, snapped in two and became embedded in his stump, splitting it to the bone.

Stephen Strassen snapped his prosthetic leg in half after falling into a pothole near his Lincolnshire home

'My stump hit the ground with an 
almighty force,' he said. 'There was just a big thump and I knew something was 
wrong so I called my wife for help straight away.'

Mr Strassen managed to call for help and his wife Anna, 42, hauled him out of the 5ft wide hole and dragged him inside their Boston home following the accident on January 17.

The next day his stump had swelled so much that Anna, a nurse, took her husband to hospital where he was forced to undergo surgery to because his wounded limb had become infected.

The force of the impact was so severe it split Mr Strassen's stump to the bone. He required surgery the following day to fight off infection

'I was in agony, I can’t describe the pain,' he said. 'It was absolutely awful, my foot came clean off and I just fell.

'The leg didn’t swell up straight away, 
it happened overnight and the swelling went right to the bone, under the
 skin, there was a massive cavity which caused fluid to build up and 
break through.'

Mr Strassen, who was forced to take months 
off work, is now suing Lincolnshire County Council who are responsible 
for maintaining the roads

But the council has vowed to fight any compensation claim.

A
 council spokesman said: 'We were sorry to hear of the gentleman’s accident, 
however, this claim has been denied following consideration of the 
normal legal principles that apply in connection with a claim of this 
nature.'

Mr
 Strassen said he used to live an active lifestyle before the accident, 
but he hasn't been able to fit a prosthetic leg on his wounded limb 
since the fall. He's been unable to work, and has spent the past three 
months confined to a wheelchair.

The once-active amputee has been confined to a wheelchair since falling into a huge pot hole in a lane near his home (pictured right)

“My life has changed completely because of
this.

“All I want to do is go back to work but I
can’t, I feel awful as this has affected my wife too who is trying to bring
home the money for the both of us.

'It was only a matter of time before someone hurt themselves and they only have themselves to blame for this.

'I haven’t heard a word from them, not an apology, absolutely nothing and it is disgusting.
