The moment Elvis Presley arrived at the White House to ask President Richard Nixon to make him an undercover federal agent will be dramatized in a movie.

Kevin Spacey will play Nixon and Michael Shannon will take the role of Presley in the bizarre tale about the bedraggled singer's offer to help save the US from hippies and The Beatles. 

With filming slated to start in 2015, Elvis & Nixon, produced by The Butler's Cassian Elwes, is expected to probe one of the more curious elements of pop history.

It started on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Washington on December 21, 1970.

Movie material: Elvis Presley's letter led to one of the most bizarre encounters ever to take place in the White House, an unlikely meeting of counter-culture icon and Right-wing bogeyman. It will now be made into a film

Elvis was riled.

He had spent around $100,000 on 10 Mercedez Benz cars and 32 handguns for Christmas presents but his family said it was too much.

The 35-year-old rock 'n' roll star, pumped with prescription pills, stormed straight to the airport - and found himself sat next to a California senator, George Murphy.

He vented that he was desperate to get his hands on a Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs ID badge to help the president's war on drugs. 

Astounded, Murphy urged him to put pen to paper and let Nixon know of his burning desire.

So he did. 

Plea: Presley scribbled this note aboard an airplane on December 21, 1970, in which he blasted The Beatles and hippies as anti-American

Presley immediately requested a wad of headed paper from a stewardess and scrawled five nearly illegible pages of erratic suggestions to the president.

He explained America regarded him as an ally, but in fact he loved 'the establishment'.

He said he was willing to do anything to serve his country - as long as he were made a Federal Agent at Large.

'I have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and Communist brainwashing techniques and I am right in the middle of the whole thing, where I can and will do the most good,' he wrote. 

The plane landed and Presley took his urgent request straight to the front door of the White House.

'I would love to meet you,' he wrote to Nixon, adding that he would be staying at the Washington Hotel under the alias Jon Burrows. 

'I will be here for as long as it takes to get the credentials of a federal agent.'

Incredibly, the president's aides implored Nixon to take up the offer in a bid to win his war on drugs and capture the public following the deaths of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix.

By noon that day, he was in the Oval Office. 

They discussed many things, once Elvis overcame his apparent awe.

He told Nixon that The Beatles were anti-American for taking US money and flocking back to the UK.

Just minutes in, Nixon agreed to make Presley an Honorary Agent at Large - earning a hug from the King.

Agreement: Minutes in, Nixon conceded and made Elvis an Honorary Federal Agent at Large, handing him ID

The story remained secret for a year until The Washington Post got wind of it. 

The singer died in 1977 of a possible overdose on his bathroom floor.

Friends and biographers later questioned his genuine admiration for the president's right-wing policies, claiming the ID badge was something he'd been hankering after for years.

However, many have given Elvis the title of 'closet Republican' in the years since.
