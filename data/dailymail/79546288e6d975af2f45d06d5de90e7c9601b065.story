Moonstruck: Cameron Read, 39, has been arrested on weapons charges for trying to shoot at the moon

An Arizona man landed behind bars after taking the inspirational tip 'shoot for the moon' a little too literally.

Cameron Read, 39, of Prescott Valley, was arrested last Friday on a slew of weapons charges after police say he discharged a handgun trying to hit the moon 238,900 miles away.

Prescott Valley police responded to the man's home after a 49-year-old woman reported that her boyfriend had fired several round from a handgun and still was armed last Friday night.

The unnamed girlfriend woman and her 15-year-old son told responding officers Read was talking about seeing Halley's Comet and fired a round out of the window.

They heard several more shots before fleeing the residence in the 4400 block of Preston Drive.

Read has been booked into the Yavapai County Jail on suspicion of felony counts of unlawful discharge of a firearm, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and endangerment plus misdemeanor criminal damage.

When officers responded to the home, Read acted 'confrontational' and initially refused to open the door, AZfamily.com reported.

Bad aim: Read admitted that he was smoking marijuana before he grabbed his handgun and squeezed off several rounds out the window hoping to strike the moon 238,900 miles away

When he finally emerged from the apartment, Read allegedly resisted arrest.

When questioned by police, Read admitted to smoking marijuana before trying to shoot the moon, but insisted that it was not his intent to hurt anyone.
