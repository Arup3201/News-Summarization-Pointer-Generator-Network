A 13-year-old boy plummeted to his death from a 15th-floor hotel balcony Saturday just as he and his family were wrapping up their Florida vacation.

Authorities say Zach Dickman was checking out of a Panama City hotel with his parents, grandparents and brother when he returned with his grandmother to their room to retrieve his cellphone.

The 7th grader would not be returning home to Indiana. He somehow fell to his gruesome death from the patio down to a pool deck down below.

Authorities were dispatched to the Palazzo condominiums around 10am after receiving a call from the boy's grandmother.

'Grandmother waited for a few seconds. 
Started calling his name no answer, that's when she realized he fell off
 the balcony,' Panama City Beach Police Chief Drew Whitman told WJHG.

Authorities say they have no reason to believe Zachary's death was anything but accidental.

However, the cause of death would not be named until an autopsy could be performed.
