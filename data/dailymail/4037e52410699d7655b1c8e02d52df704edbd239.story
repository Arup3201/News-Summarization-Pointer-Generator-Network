Restaurateurs and their diners know the best way to a hungry seagulls' stomach is through their half-eaten  food.

In a bid to keep gulls from scavenging, management is currently trialling different deterrents, including a robot bird to protect patrons who dine along the Sydney Opera House.

The giant mechanical bird is reported at a cost of $6500 to prevent the out-of-control gulls targeting or attacking tourists and diners for free food.

A spokeswoman for the Opera House told Sydney Morning Herald that a number of different deterrents were being explored, adding that setting baits is not an option as seagulls are a native species, protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act.  

'Our venue operators and the Opera House have trialled other additional measures on an ad-hoc basis, including kites that resembled owls and an audio deterrent,' the spokeswoman said.

'None, including the mock bird of prey, has proved very effective.'

'Unfortunately the seagulls become accustomed to these kind of tactics so they are only ever a short-term fix. 

'We have been advised that the best way to manage them is to take away the food source but, being a waterfront dining destination and a fish market, completely removing the food source is not an option,' the spokeswoman said.

'All we can do is try and limit the birds' access to food.'
