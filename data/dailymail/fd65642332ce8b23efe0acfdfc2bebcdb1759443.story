Burnley fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday. 

Danny Ings was dangerous throughout for The Clarets while Eliaquim Mangala had another poor game for Manuel Pellegrini's side. Find out how the other players got on with Sportsmail's player ratings. 

MANCHESTER CITY

Joe Hart - 6

Might have done better for Boyd's goal, allowed the ball to creep in.

Summer signing Eliaquim Mangala had a poor game against the energetic Danny Ings on Sunday 

Pablo Zabaleta - 6

Usual overlapping runs and infectious energy. His attacking threat so important to City but became quite reckless in the second half.

Eliaquim Mangala - 4.5

Couldn’t cope with Ings’ quick feet and speed on the turn. Has improved of late but this was a flashback to the unconvincing performances of the autumn.

Martin Demichelis - 6

His experience should have counted for more in that second half. Demichelis has been excellent of late but naturally City need Kompany back - and quickly.

Ashley Barnes wheels away in celebration, as Joe Hart watches the shot hit the back of his net

Aleksandar Kolarov - 5

Good outlet for City in attack but struggled to keep Tripper quiet going the other way.

Fernando - 6

Useful anchor in the midfield and gives City good balance. Influence waned in the second half.

Fernandinho - 7

Beautiful curling effort to score his first goal of the season. Has recovered from World Cup nightmare with Brazil and now in good nick.

Jesus Navas - 6.5

Laid on Silva’s opening goal but can be wasteful with his delivery.

Fernandinho's shot fly towards Tom Heaton's goal, where it nestled in the top corner at the Etihad Stadium

David Silva - 7

Terrific again. Time seems to stand still when he has the ball and he affirms that the coolest minds cause the greatest destruction.

Samir Nasri - 5

A little subdued playing from the left and not at his best. Struggled to influence the game.

James Milner - 5.5

Poor display and he will be looking forward to returning to midfield duties.

Subs

Stevan Jovetic (for Milner, 62) - 5

Looked short of match fitness and couldn’t find a third goal for City.

Frank Lampard (for Samir Nasri, 76) - 5.5

Couldn’t find another important goal to nick the points for City.

Scott Sinclair (for Fernandinho, 88) - 5.5

Last throw of the dice by Pellegrini didn’t come off.

BURNLEY

Tom Heaton - 6

Helpless for the goals but one fine save from Nasri in the second half.

Kieran Trippier - 6

Better going forward than defensively. Several dangerous deliveries caused anxiety in City defence.

Jason Shackell - 6

Might have got closer to Silva for the first goal. Unfamiliar challenge with Milner an orthodox frontman.

Manchester United loanee Michael Keane competes for the ball with Samir Nasri and James Milner

Michael Keane - 6.5

Nervous start from Manchester United loanee but grew into the game with a composed showing.

Ben Mee - 6

Former City defender found it tough going against the pace of Navas and energy of Zabaleta.

Scott Arfield - 6

Diligent in the midfield and forward-thinking with his passing. Did well on the left flank in the second half.

Dean Marney - 6.5

Came close to an equaliser in the second half with a long range strike. Crowded out by sheer weight of numbers in the City midfield.

George Boyd spreads his arms wide in celebration after netting his side's first goal at the Etihad on Sunday

David Jones - 6

Testing afternoon against the power and dynamism of Fernandinho and Fernando in midfield but improved as it went on.

George Boyd - 6.5

Gives Burnley balance from the left and offers flair and industry for Sean Dyche’s team.

Ashley Barnes - 7.5

Magnificent strike to secure a point and that’s his third in four games.

Danny Ings - 7

Strength and pace constantly challenged Mangala but first-touch let him down in promising positions a few times.
