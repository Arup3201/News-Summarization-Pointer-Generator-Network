An experienced teacher has been banned from the classroom after admitting she was drunk in front of pupils.

Sarah O’Hanlon, 34, was intoxicated while running a drama club just three weeks after she started her new job at Sandymoor School in Runcorn, Cheshire, last September.

She was also unable to respond to an intruder alarm due to her drunken state and drove her car to school after she had been drinking.

The teacher was also punished for not telling education recruitment company, Capita, why she had been dismissed from her previous position when she applied for a new job in January.

O'Hanlon admitted the allegations and was told she is not allowed to enter a classroom for two years.

But she has been given the opportunity to go back to teaching once she has addressed her  'problems'.

A professional conduct panel for The National College for Teaching and Leadership said: 'The behaviours are a serious departure from the personal and professional conduct elements of the latest Teachers’ Standards and could have seriously affected the education and well-being of pupils.

'The panel have noted her previous good history and that she has taken steps to deal with the underlying problem, however they have judged that there is a continuing risk to the education and well-being of pupils.'

'This was a serious departure from the personal and professional conduct elements of the latest Teachers’ Standards.

'This was misconduct that could have seriously affected the education and well-being of pupils. This is a continuing risk.

'We considered that matters put forward in mitigation by Ms O’Hanlon and noted that she has a previous good history. However, her actions in giving false information to Capita were deliberate. There is no evidence of duress.

'Ms O’Hanlon has acknowledged her problem and has taken steps to address it. The Panel notes that she is aware of the task ahead and is learning to control her feelings and manage her problems.

A spokesman from the school said pupils were never at risk.

He added: 'We can confirm that Ms O’Hanlon was employed by the school for the duration stated in the prohibition order and that the panel hearing that led to her prohibition was triggered by the school’s actions.

'Ms O’Hanlon was employed following a full recruitment process, including formal interviews, lesson observations, references from former employers and a full, enhanced CRB check.

'Ms O’Hanlon held qualified teacher status and had significant experience of working in schools prior to being employed by us.

'As soon as the issues were brought to light, Ms O’Hanlon was suspended, pending investigation and the school’s disciplinary procedures were followed throughout.'
