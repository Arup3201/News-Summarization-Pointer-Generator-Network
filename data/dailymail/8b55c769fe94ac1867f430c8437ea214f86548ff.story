Poland's former democracy leader Lech Walesa has broken his leg - and landed in a hospital where a fellow patient is a communist-era official involved in directing the 1981 crackdown that put him in prison.

Walesa, 71, the founder of the Solidarity trade union and a former president of Poland, broke his right leg on Tuesday while leaving a church in his hometown of Gdansk.

A photo he posted on his blog shows Walesa in his hospital bed with his broken leg raised and in a cast.

Polish media on Wednesday highlighted the irony of him being in the same Gdansk hospital as General Czeslaw Kiszczak, who as interior minister in 1981 played a key role in imposing martial law.

The hospital's doctors are examining Kiszczak, 89, to determine whether he is strong enough to stand trial for his role in communist-era repressions.

Kiszczak has said that he is too sick to appear in court, but tabloids have shown photos of him this year vacationing and apparently in decent form.

Walesa was a key figure in Poland's transformation from a member of the Soviet bloc to an independent post-communist nation.

An engineer and electrician by trade, shortly after beginning work at the shipyard in Gdansk, Poland (then known as Lenin Shipyard), he came a vocal dissident and worker rights campaigner, and established the Soviet bloc's first trade union, Solidarity.

During this time he operated in fierce opposition to the Polish communist leadership, which included Kiszczak, who is currently being treated in the same hospital as Walesa.

Kiszczak was instrumental in overseeing martial law throughout Poland from 1981 - 1983.

Walesa's staunch advocacy of worker rights led to him being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and he was later President from 1990 to 1995, where he helped oversee the country's transition through privatization and to a free-market economy.
