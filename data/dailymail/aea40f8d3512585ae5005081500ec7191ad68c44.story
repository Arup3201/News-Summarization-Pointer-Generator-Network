If you have a spare £1.8 million and you want to snap up the perfect home you have two options: a three-bedroom house in Britain's most expensive area or 25 of the same size in Scotland.

A survey which compares house prices in 376 councils across the UK has ranked Kensington and Chelsea - where a three-bedroom home sells for £1.8 on average - as the most expensive place to live in the UK.

Travel 400 miles north to East Ayrshire and you can buy a similar sized property for just £72,500.

Mapped: The price of an average three-bedroom house across Britain and the combined salary a family would need to pay for the house in red

The average house price in the UK reached £250,000 last month - more than three times the cost of the average East Ayrshire home.

The survey, reported in The Telegraph, was carried out by property analysts Hometrack.

The company found that property prices in cities in the north such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham are at least five times cheaper than a house located on one of London's most expensive streets.

Liverpool took the title of most affordable city in Britain to buy property. The average price of a three-bedroom house in the northern city is £82,000.

After East Ayrshire, the second cheapest area was in Falkirk, Scotland, where a three-bedroom home costs £78,000.

Third on the list was Blaenau Gwent, in Wales where the cost of the same house would come to £80,000.

East Ayrshire in Scotland is the cheapest place in the country to buy a three-bedroom home. At 72,500, you could buy 25 houses for the same price as one home in Kensington and Chelsea

Hometrack also compiled a top 20 list of the most expensive property areas.

It found that 17 of the 20 areas with the highest price tags were within London. Two of the other hot spots were in Surrey. The areas were: Elmbridge, which includes the towns of Esher, Walton-on-Thames and Weybridge; and Mole 
Valley, which covers Dorking and Leatherhead.

The third was St Albans in 
Hertfordshire. In the three hot spot areas outside of London, a three-bedroom house cost between 
£403,750 and £450,000. To afford the mortgage, an annual household income would need to be between 
£103,677 and £115,553.

In London, boroughs such as Camden and 
Hammersmith are prohibitive for middle class professionals because they 
are priced out of the market by wealthier buyers and cash-rich 
foreigners.

Property giant Savills estimates that a third of property resale in prime locations involve foreign buyers.

In Camden, a family would need to earn a combined sum of £225,329 to buy a mid-range £877,500 family home.

In Hammersmith, family earnings needed to buy a £829,695 home would total £213,036.

In addition to the property prices, experts also analysed the home owners' houses in the 376 councils.

They found that, to pay off a mortgage on
 a three-bedroom property in Kensington and Chelsea a family would need 
to earn a pre-tax income of £462,214. In East Ayrshire, a household 
salary would need to come to just £18,617.

In a staggering 20 areas across the UK, to buy a three-bedroom property a family income would have to exceed £100,000.Places on the list include: St Alban's, Camden, and Westminster.

St Albans is one of the most expensive places in the country to buy a property - outside of London. The average three-bedroom house costs £415,000

Places on the list include: St Alban's, Camden, and Westminster.

And
 although the national average income in the UK is £28,200, in 352 areas
 a family's salary would have to exceed that sum if they wanted to 
purchase a three-bedroom house.

To calculate a family's salary, the analysts looked at the median price for a three-bedroom house in 376 council areas.

They then worked out how much buyers would have to spend if they took out a 90 per cent repayment mortgage at four percent, over 25 years.

The survey worked on the assumption that a family could afford to spend 30 per cent of their income on the mortgage.

Richard Donnell from Hometrack told The Telegraph that the London market was 'driven by 
cash purchases and interest-only mortgages, which aren’t available to 
everyone'.

He said that some couples buying prices down the property ladder might be put off by buying property because of the debt involved.
