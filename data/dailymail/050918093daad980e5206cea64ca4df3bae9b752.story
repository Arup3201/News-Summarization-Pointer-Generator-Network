A lawyer arrested by police at his Sydney city office on class A drug charges was, together with a co-accused, part of a 'sophisticated drug syndicate', a court heard on Friday.

Australian Government solicitor Nick Gouliaditis, 34, clutched his face and looked stressed while sitting in the dock at Central Local Court, wearing what appeared to be the same clothes he wore when he was arrested more than 24 hours before on Thursday.

He cut a very different figure from the happy snaps of him partying, drinking booze and hanging out with his family posted on his Facebook page.

Gouliaditis has been charged with dealing and possessing drugs, resisting arrest, dealing in the proceeds of crime and possessing a prohibited weapon.

Police prosecutor Vanessa Robichuax alleged a Taser was found by police in a safe in his bedroom at his home in Newtown in the city's inner-west.

The court was told his co-accused, Andrew James Connell, 24, was arrested on the same day at a unit in the Kings Cross nightclub district.

Sgt Robichaux told the bail hearing that the men were involved in a 'sophisticated' criminal operation.

Sgt Robichaux said Gouliaditis, whose bail was set at $20,000, also supplied drugs to two different people in a matter of hours despite an alleged buyer warning the 34-year-old he had been apprehended by officers earlier.

His defence counsel Jeff Tanks told court the alleged 'syndicate' was not sophisticated but instead a 'street level' and 'garden variety' operation.

Sgt Robichaux said police evidence against the men included telephone intercepts as well as physical and electronic surveillance.

Connell's bail was also set at $20,000. He wore prison greens and sat in the dock stony-faced, as his mother and other members of his family sat in the gallery.

Connell, who the court heard has mental health issues, was charged with offences including supplying prohibited drugs and dealing with the proceeds of crime.

Sgt Robichaux argued that Connell had supplied drugs to mid-level dealers and was of too high risk to be granted bail.

She told court he is unemployed and has been involved in a number of drug related offences before.

Mr Gouliaditis, pictured here being arrested in Sydney yesterday, appeared to be wearing the same blue shirt in court today.

His defence barrister argued Connell had no history of violent offences.

Gouliaditis will have to stay at his parents' home in Cronulla and report to local police regularly - among other conditions.

Connell will leave Sydney to stay with his father in country NSW under a similarly strict set of terms, including receiving treatment from a mental health professional.

The two men are due to face court again in October.
