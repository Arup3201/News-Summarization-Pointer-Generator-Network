Tasteless food and poor service don’t only ruin a meal. They also make it traumatic.

A study found that diners who give restaurants bad reviews use language and grammar very similar to that of people who have survived terrorist attacks and mass shootings.

Linguist Dan Jurafsky said that people who post online reviews might think they are writing about food but they are actually revealing their psychological state.

A new study suggests that terrible food (stock image) and service in restaurants can make a meal traumatic. A study found that diners who give restaurants bad reviews use language and grammar very similar to that of people who have survived terrorist attacks and mass shootings

The tendency of those unhappy with their meals to use ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’, rather than ‘I’ is particularly revealing.

Professor Jurafsky, of Stanford University, in California, said: ‘It turns out that there's previous scientific literature showing exactly that characteristic constellation of linguistic features characterising a particular genre and that genre is the genre of people writing after they've been traumatised.

‘So people writing after 9/11, or students writing in the campus paper after a campus tragedy, use exactly this language.

‘In particular they use the first person plural, they say this bad thing happened to us as a group and we're going to get through it together.

‘This idea of getting through suffering collectively is there in these reviews.’

People who write negative restaurant reviews (a stock image is pictured) often use ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’, rather than ‘I’, indicating that the experience leaves the scarred, according to linguist Dan Jurafsky

The study found that people change the way they write about food in restaurant reviews, and it reveals a lot about their state of mind.

For example, people who had a bad experience, tended to use we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’, rather than ‘I’ – like victims of trauma.

Delicious food that is also expensive is written about in sensuous and sexy terms, such as an ‘orgasmic’ pastry or ‘seductively seared foie gras’.

But tempting fast food is described as a drug – for example, ‘craving’ cupcakes, likening fries to crack and ‘addictive’ chicken wings.

Professor Jurafsky said that people may feel less guilty about eating fast food if they think of it as a drug that they simply couldn’t resist. 

He added that while the diners’ distress is minor compared to that experienced by victims of real tragedies, it still leaves them scarred.

The professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) annual conference: ‘We’re very sensitive to personal interaction and can really be injured by things that are not going to kill us but really affect us.’

His analysis of a random selection of almost one million reviews about more than 6,500 US restaurants also revealed that those who said they had a bad time wrote little about the food.

Instead, they tended to be upset by rude staff and being made to wait for their meals.

The study also revealed our interesting choice of words when describing food that we like.

Delicious food that is also expensive is written about in sensuous and sexy terms but tempting fast food is described as a drug. 

The study also revealed our choice of words when describing food that we like. For example, a pastry (stock image pictured left) was described as ‘orgasmic.' Analysis of restaurant menus found that the use of long words to describe a dish is a sign that it will be pricey, so decaffeinated coffee (right) would be more expensive

For instance, an expensive pastry was ‘orgasmic’ and someone who enjoyed their foie gras said it was ‘seductively seared’.

One very happy diner had ‘very naughty deep-fried pork belly’.

In contrast, tasty cupcakes were ‘craved’ and good chips were likened to crack cocaine.

Professor Jurafsky said that people may feel less guilty about eating fast food if they think of it as a drug that they simply couldn’t resist.

A separate analysis of restaurant menus found that the use of long words to describe a dish is a sign that it will be pricey.

The professor said: ‘For every extra letter describing a dish, the dish was 18cents (10p) more expensive.’

This suggests that a decaffeinated coffee would be 80p dearer than a cheap and cheerful ‘decaf’.
