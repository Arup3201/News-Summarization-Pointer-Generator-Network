Want to know what the samurai ate for breakfast?

Centuries-old cookbooks offer a glimpse into the daily eating habits of the samurai and other Japanese people from the 18th century.

The books, which feature beautiful hand-drawn illustrations, were published in the late 1700s, during the Edo Period.

During this time Japan was still under the policy of political and cultural isolation, which means the books offer a glimpse of Japanese cuisine from the era, largely unadulterated by foreign influence.

The Complete Box of 100 Secrets for Cooking Daikon Radish provided instructions on how to prepare this elaborate radish chain

These books show that when it comes to cooking, many things have stayed the same. An emphasis on elaborate presentation was just as important in 18th century Japan as it is today, as can be seen with the radish chain.

Much like recipe books today, the Japanese cookbooks have titles designed to sell, such as The Complete Box of 100 Secrets for Cooking Daikon Radish and the hyperbolically titled, The Box of 10,000 Secret Cooking Treasures, which does not deliver 10,000 secrets, as promised, but does publish 103 egg recipes, including one for a reversed-egg dish with a yellow outer layer and white yolk.

Another book, Box of 100 Secrets for Cooking Sea Bream, provides instruction on how to prepare the fish in 100 different ways. The sea bream was highly prized and was regularly served at celebrations because its name, tai, is similar to the word omedetai , or congratulations.

The fluffy texture of Castella tofu was quite a novelty in 18th century Japan. This type of tofu, also featured in the cookbook, was named after the castella cakes brought to Japan by Portuguese traders

One of the most popular cookbooks of the time, One Hundred Unique Types of Tofu, offered 100 different tofu recipes including whirlpool tofu, made by wrapping a layer of seaweed around the tofu and egg tofu and in which a ring of cream-coloured bean curd surrounds a slice of carrot.

Another variety, castella tofu looks similar to tofu we might buy in supermarkets in the 21st century West, however was quite novel at the time in Japan. This variety of tofu resembles in texture the castella cakes introduced by Portuguese traders and is made by soaking the tofu in sake overnight and then boiling it for four hours.

The tofu cookbook was released in 1782, during first extended period of peace following centuries of civil war in Japan, and the author is listed as Suikyodojin Kahitsujun, which is suspected to be a pen name, reports Rocket News 24.

As well as recipes, the cookbook provides a history of tofu and was such a hit that a sequel was commissioned.
