When pictures of her weight loss made headlines last week, the Duchess of York put it down to regular mountain-running sessions with her personal trainer.

But sources close to Prince Andrew’s ex-wife say there is another, rather more unusual, reason for her slimline figure – jam roly-poly flavoured tea.

The diet drink was created for her after Sarah decided to embark on a health and fitness regime.

Unusual: The Duchess of York put her weight loss down to regular mountain-running sessions with her personal trainer. But sources say there is another reason for her slimline figure - jam roly-poly flavoured tea

She went to a bootcamp in the Swiss Alps and over 12 weeks lost more than two stone through daily mountain runs and hikes with her trainer, Josh Saltzmann, and eating a calorie-controlled diet.

But, said a friend, 54-year-old Sarah still struggled with her sweet tooth.

In desperation, she went to a master tea maker and asked them to create a range of flavoured hot diet drinks she could have instead of reaching for the biscuit tin.

Together they came up with a range of 17 teas in three categories. The first is based on English puddings and includes jam roly-poly, rhubarb fool, strawberries and cream, bakewell tart, chocolate torte, and mint humbug.

The second is a variety of ‘mocktail’ teas including pink champagne, gin and tonic, whisky and ginger, and pina colada. The third is a take on classics including English Breakfast and Earl Grey.

The teas helped her lose another stone – making three stone in all – and Sarah is said to be delighted, even though critics have described her as looking tired and drawn.

Now the once cash-strapped duchess is looking at bringing out her own personal range of pudding-flavoured diet teas.

But, said a friend, the 54-year-old still struggled with her sweet tooth. So the Duchess went to a tea maker who created a range of diet drinks, including one tasting of mint humbugs (right)

The friend said: ‘At the moment the teas are just for her but she has had so much interest in them that she is considering whether to market them.

'There are a number of commercial opportunities she is exploring but nothing has been signed yet.’

Sarah’s weight has yo-yoed over the years and the friend added: ‘Like most women she just wants to feel better about herself.

‘But she is also very keen to work on the global plan to combat obesity and wanted to put her money where her mouth was, so to speak.’
