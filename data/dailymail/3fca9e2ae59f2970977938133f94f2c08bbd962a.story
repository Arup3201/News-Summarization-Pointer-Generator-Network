Britain's youngest undertaker could be the next star of the X Factor.

Rachael Ryan, 18, has sailed through her audition for Simon Cowell's ITV show and won the panel over when she admitted to having to stop herself singing pop songs to corpses while at work.

The mortician, from Newport, South Wales, first started working part time at her father's undertakers at 13.

Going places: Teenage undertaker Rachael Ryan, Britain's youngest, has won through the first round of the X Factor

In the family: Rachael helps run the business with father Mike and sister Louise and revealed to the X Factor panel she has to stop herself singing to corpses at work

At 16 she was made director of the firm, which is now called Michael G Ryan Son and Daughters Funeral Directors.

'I think they were just a bit surprised when I told them I'm an undertaker,' she said.

'I love my job - I've grown up in the family business and started helping when I was only 13.

'But my real ambition in life is to be a singer - I've been singing since I was just five years old.

'Sometimes I have to stop myself singing in the funeral parlour - I just love it.'

Miss Ryan was among hundreds of hopefuls who turned up for the auditions in Newport.

Next step: Rachael, pictured with sister Louise, is being tipped as the star of this year's X Factor

She impressed producers after singing Katy Perry's 'Unconditionally' and Emeli Sande's 'Read all about it'.

'They said yes straight away - I couldn't believe it,' she said.

'Then they asked me what I do for a living, I think they thought I was a student or worked in a clothes shop or something.

'They were a bit surprised when I said I'm a director of an undertakers.'

Rachael also works with older 
sister Louise, 23, at the family business.

'The X Factor people wanted to know all about what my job involves,' she said.

'I get asked those things all the time - but to me it is my job and it's all I've ever known.'

Her
 work duties include arranging funerals and leading hearses to 
churches and crematoria in traditional top hat and tails.

So her success on the X Factor is a world away from her sombre work life.

Her father Mike, 60, said: 'We are very proud of her - she is following her dream.'
