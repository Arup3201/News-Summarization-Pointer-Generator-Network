A barman who 'mooned' the Queen with an Australian flag tucked between the cheeks of his bare bottom will not be charged with wilful exposure, police said today.

Liam Warriner, from Sydney,  will plead guilty to a lesser charge of causing a public nuisance, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail.

He flashed the 85-year-old monarch and Prince Philip, 90, as their motorcade was driven through Brisbane last October.

The 22-year-old was understood to have been unloading shipping containers at the time.

Remorseless: Liam Warriner will not be charged with wilful exposure after 'mooning' the Queen during her visit to Brisbane in October. He will plead guilty to the lesser charge of causing a public nuisance, police said

Guest of honour: The Queen, accompanied by Prince Philip and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, walks down a slipway to board a cruiser on the Brisbane River. Shortly beforehand, police said the monarch was 'mooned' by Warriner as she passed him in her motorcade

Police today told Brisbane Magistrates Court that they have dropped the charge of wilful exposure, which carries a penalty of one year in prison.

Defence attorney John-Paul Mould told 
Magistrate Brian Hine that Warriner will plead guilty to creating a public nuisance when he appears for sentencing on February 
14.

It is not clear whether the royal couple saw Warriner.

Warriner, who was not in court today, has admitted holding an Australian flag clenched between his 
bare buttocks and running as the royal couple's motorcade drove by.

But he maintained that he did not expose his genitals as alleged in the willful exposure charge.

‘I mooned the Queen,’ Warriner said after being charged last year. ‘I did it because my workmates dared me to.’

Speaking with a sense of pride at his actions, Warriner added: ‘Everybody’s seen someone’s butt, come on.

‘You see it on TV all the time, you see it in movies, it’s accepted in PG rated programming these days.

‘But yet it’s an offence to the Queen.’

Well-wishers: Thousands of people line the Brisbane River in the city's South Bank to wave to the Queen during the royal visit

Warriner, who gave the V for victory sign as he spoke, said the Queen waved at him and that was when he dropped his trousers.

But his claim that the Queen had singled him out for a wave was highly unlikely. Thousands of people were lining the 
banks of the Brisbane River along which the Queen was sailing and most 
people were so far away from the cruiser that it is doubtful she saw 
what any individual was doing.

Warriner said he ran for 50 yards with his trousers and underwear down, but no-one saw anything other than his bare bottom.

He said: ‘Not the front at all. There were loads of people there to see the Queen. I wouldn’t want all of them seeing that.’

Warriner is no stranger to protests against authority. He revealed he is part of an anti-elite protest movement called Occupy and had recently taken part in protests in Sydney.

He said: ‘I’d like to say we are the 99 per cent human need over corporate greed and we won’t accept any of this any longer.'

Police later clarified where Warriner had been standing. They said he was in an area at the roadside where the Queen was passing by in a motorcade before she stepped onto the cruiser to sail down the river.

A spokeswoman for Queensland police said: ‘Police officers at the front of the motorcade saw the alleged incident and reported to others further back.'
