A woman who removed her wedding dress from storage after 26 years was shocked to discovered that it was not the gown she had worn on her trip down the aisle.

Kim Jones' daughter Emily had begged her mother to show her the dress she got married in.

When the two women pulled the dress from under the bed at their Georgia home and out of its many protective wrappings, they discovered something amiss. The dress had long sleeves and was a different shade to Mrs Jones' gown on her wedding day in 1986.

The mother and daughter came to the conclusion that a mix-up had happened at the cleaners. The only clue was a 1986 dry-cleaning ticket from White Way Cleaners in Brentwood, Tennessee.

The mistake had gone unnoticed for so long because Mrs Jones was told to keep the dress tightly wrapped to protect it.

The mother and daughter are now desperately trying to find out where the original dress went - a difficult task considering the cleaning business shut down years ago.

Daughter Emily Jones told the Tennessean: 'As the only girl in the family, this is 
the one thing that my mother had for me... And to find out that it wasnâ€™t hers after all these 
years was very disappointing.'
