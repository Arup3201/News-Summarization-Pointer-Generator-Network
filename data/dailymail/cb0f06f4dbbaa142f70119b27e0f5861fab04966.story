The owners of a $4million Cincinnati mansion that was destroyed in a massive fire a year ago are suing their insurance company for $60million for allegedly refusing to cover the blaze.

Jeffrey Decker, who owns an Ohio home building company, and wife Maria claim that they still haven't been paid by Chubb National Insurance Co. for the January 8, 2014 fire that destroyed their home in Indian Hill, Ohio.

Despite the family paying nearly $20,000 a year in  premiums, the Deckers say that their insurance company breached their contract for coverage 'without reasonable justification,' WLWT reports. 

Even though the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and a slew of local agencies have investigated the blaze, the cause still has not been determined more than a year later.

The 10,000-square-foot, 22-room mansion was 90percent destroyed in the fire, which took crews more than seven hours to bring under control. 

No one was home at the time and there were no injuries. 

The Deckers are suing for $15million in damages for alleged breach of contract and asking for nearly $45million more in punitive damages. 

Chubb National has declined to comment on the lawsuit. 

The family estimated damages from the fire totaled about $5million - including the contents of the home.

The Deckers carried a policy of about $8.8million on the home and $4.4million on the property inside. 

There were also riders for $208,400 in jewelry, $18,687 in furs and $5,705 in art. Four cars carried an insurance of value of $83,000. 

No one was home when the mansion caught fire 

It took crews seven hours to extinguish the blaze, which caused an estimated $5million in damage
