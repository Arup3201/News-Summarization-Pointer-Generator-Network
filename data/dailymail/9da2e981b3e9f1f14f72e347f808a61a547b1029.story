Rebuked: Charlie Sheen has been slapped with a restraining order after violating a gagging clause over his custody case with Brooke Mueller

Charlie Sheen was given a dressing down by the judge presiding over the custody case involving his twins Bob and Max after making very public comments about the ongoing legal proceedings.

According to TMZ, the Anger Management star was slapped with a restraining order which contains a gagging clause meaning that if he talks publicly about the case - or the boys' mother Brooke Mueller - again... he's off to prison.

The 48-year-old was also warned by the judge: 'Don't forget, I'm Italian!'

According to the report, Charlie is forbidden from going within 200 yards of Brooke or contacting her. When told this he apparently replied: 'Thank you.'

He may also face a penalty for violating the original gagging order.

Brooke, 36, was also in court and had her lawyers try to suspend Sheen's visitation rights to no avail.She also wants Sheen's ex Denise Richards removed as guardian of the four year old boys but that wasn't accepted.

Her lawyer tried to cite Sheen's 'grenade cake' threat but the judge stuck to Sheen's comments on TMZ live. 

However, according to RadarOnline.com, Brooke looks set to regain full custody of the boys by Christmas, after impressing the Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services with her commitment to getting sober and turning her life around.

A source told the website: 'Brooke will be awarded custody of the boys by Christmas, as long as she doesn’t relapse. She has been sober for several months. She hasn’t had one dirty test.

'She has done everything that has been asked of her by DCFS, so at this point, there is absolutely no reason for Brooke not to get her boys back.'

The suggestion that Brooke could regain custody comes just days after photographs emerged of her son Bob with severe bruising to his head.

Injuries: Photos of Charlie Sheen's four-year-old son Bob show 'injuries' he allegedly sustained while in the care of his mother Brooker Mueller or grandmother Moira Fiore

The shocking images show injuries on Bob's face, which it has been alleged in a document submitted to an LA court were sustained while the boy was in the care of his mother Brooke Mueller or his grandmother Moira Fiore.

In one zoomed-in image,
reportedly taken by Charlie's ex-wife Denise Richards, Bob returned from a weekend with Mueller and 
Fiore on July 26, with a noticeable raw skin sore near the red 
mark.

Sore: Bob's pictures, have allegedly been presented to LA Department of Children and Family Services by Sheen's legal team

The images have now been presented to the LA Department of Children and Family Services by Sheen's legal team.

The 
before-and-after images, allegedly taken following a visit with his mother on July 26, claim to show Bob with a large red welt on the 
right side of his face, under his hairline and in front of his right 
ear.

Sources told 
TMZ Charlie believed it was a burn, although Brooke insisted he had it 
before he arrived at her home.

According to TMZ, an enraged Charlie said: 'These crimes against my children will be exposed.

'These war criminals will be hanged at dusk to a cheering and jeering crowd, gathered together in love in support of all children who are mercilessly discarded like garbage by CPS. Which by the way stands for 'CAN'T PROTECT SH***.'

He even quoted 
his actor father Martin Sheen's famous film Apocalypse Now to describe the current 
situation, whilst violating his gag order.

Charlie allegedly told TMZ: 'I am beyond their timid lying morality, therefore I am beyond caring.

'What
my family and I are forced to deal with in the last four years, lives 
outside the pale of any acceptable conduct or decency.

'I am battling an 
amorphous enemy that needs to be swiftly disempowered.'

Denise, 42, was granted temporary custody of Bob and Max after 
Brooke was admitted to rehab for the 21st time earlier this year.

The pictures emerged as Denise wrote a letter to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that she will no longer look after the boys because of their violent outbursts towards her daughters and dogs according to TMZ.

Violent: While Denise Richards took in Charlie Sheen's sons earlier this year when their mother went to rehab, she says she can no longer care for them after they started attacking her daughters and dogs

The James Bond actress reportedly blames Brooke completely for the boys’ behaviour and TMZ reports she revealed they have lashed out at her and Charlie's daughters, Sam, nine, and Lola, eight, as well as her adopted child Eloise, two. 

The website says Denise claims her daughters have been 'strangled, kicked in the head and stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face and head, and spit on by Bob and Max’. 

She also alleges they have thrown their own faeces at her daughters.

After visiting Brooke, Bob is said to have thrown a toy at Sam which left her needing medical attention.

They
are also said to have attacked Denise’s dogs, with TMZ reporting they 
‘repeatedly kick her dogs in the head and squeeze their heads with both 
hands while watching the dogs whimper in pain.

'The kids will flip from sweetly petting the dog to strangling the animals and lifting them off the ground by the neck’.

The twins, who Denise says often go into a 'zombie-like state', are said to have told her they ‘wanted to hurt and kill the dogs’. 

But their behaviour is not limited to home with Bob, in particular, reportedly attacking fellow students and teachers at the school they started in November. 

According to TMZ, Denise attributes the bad behaviour to time spent with Brooke and says the twins suffer terrible nightmares after spending time at her home. 

Richards claims she has been advised to get counselling for the twins but Brooke has refused to allow it.

TMZ reports that the actress took an email to the L.A. Department of Children and Family Services written by Dr. Jay Gordon, an Assistant Professor of Paediatrics at UCLA Medical School.

'As we have discussed, because of recent events involving the boys' behaviour I think that they need urgent evaluation,' the email states. 'I am very concerned 
about their escalating violent actions; The apparent lack of 
understanding of the consequences and the safety of others is most 
worrisome. '

The doctor then recommends 'a complete developmental and behavioural assessment' by a paediatric psychiatrist.

But Denise alleges that Brooke is trying to 'block the treatment for Bob and Max' recommended in the email.

The parents: Charlie is concerned about letting drug addict and rehab hopper Brooke have access to the twins and has lashed out calling her a 'whore' and a 'chubby weirdo', seen right in September

News of Denise’s letter comes just 
after Charlie, 48, branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed
attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. 

He
wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. ‘you 
are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me
and my boys (sic)’

He also posted a bizarre 'birthday' message to her on Tuesday, even though Brooke turned 36 in August.

He
captioned a picture of a grenade on top of a cake with the words: 
'happy Bday Brooke when you're done sucking off the parking lot at Home 
Depot why don't ya 'blow' out this candle. c'

According to TMZ, the petition claims Charlie said: ‘There will be a reckoning. There will be a whirlwind. That they will all reap while desperate begging for my forgiveness. You've all been warned.

‘I will exercise every resource at my
disposal. I will, I will, I will, I will empty my entire war chest and 
if I can't get it done, I know a guy who can.’

A follow-up hearing has been set for next month.

At
the weekend, Denise was reportedly informed by the DCFS that she was 
not allowed to take the children over to the actor's house for a visit.

A
source claimed that officials told the actress that they were annoyed 
with Charlie after he claimed his sons were in danger and were not being
protected by the department after they were allowed an overnight stay 
with Brooke.

The 48-year-old actor blasted Brooke on Twitter as an ‘evil and pathetic uber loser’ and slammed the DCFS as being ‘inept’.

Uncertain future: It is unclear what exactly will happen to the twins if Denise asks for them to be removed from her home
