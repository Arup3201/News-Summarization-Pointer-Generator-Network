Former swimming star Grant Hackett has talked to police about the night he was allegedly seen walking through a casino semi naked, searching for his son.

Hackett was photographed looking panicked in the foyer of the Crown Casino in Melbourne on February 22, allegedly shirtless and barefoot as he desperately searched for his four year old son that went missing.

A witness told the Herald Sun the former Olympic champion was in the foyer of the Casino, asking if anyone had seen his son Jagger.

The Australian reports Hackett's manager, Chris White, confirmed that the swimming champion had voluntarily attended a Melbourne police station on Friday to answer questions about the incident.

It's believed he was in Melbourne to spent time with his twins, Charlize and Jagger, 5,  and returned to the Gold Coast.

'There is little I can say at this stage,' Hackett told the Australian while at the airport.

Police have confirmed they interviewed a 34 year old Queensland man regarding the Melbourne incident  and that he was released pending further inquiries.

'We cannot comment any further,' said a police media spokesperson.

In February, Jagger had gone missing from the hotel room the family was staying in. He was later found safe and well by Crown Security within the casino complex, according to reports.

It is unclear where exactly Jagger was found, but it is understood he was not on the gaming room floor or on any licensed premises.

Hackett reportedly awoke in the early hours of Saturday morning when he realised his son had disappeared.

According to reports, Hackett was unable to locate the child in the room or the nearby corridors and ran into the foyer half-dressed asking for help.

Hackett, who lives in Sydney, picked up Jagger and his twin sister Charlize and took them to Crown, where he regularly stays when in Melbourne.

The former Olympic freestyle champion lives in Sydney following a nasty divorce with the twins’ mother, Candice Alley.

The marriage ended in 2012, with Hackett later admiting in an interview he was rliant on Stillnox sleeping pills towards the end of his swimming career.

Hackett also made headlines back in October, 2011 when he trashed the penthouse apartment he was staying in after Derby Day celebrations.
