An act of selfless bravery: Danny Lewin was the first person to be killed on 9/11 after trying to stop terrorists from hijacking the plane he was on

The remarkable story of the first victim of the 9/11 attacks and his doomed attempt to stop Al Qaeda terrorists who had hijacked a plane destined for the Twin Towers has been told for the first time.

Internet entrepreneur Danny Lewin, 31, was travelling on American Airlines Flight 11 when it was hijacked just 16 minutes into a journey from Boston to Los Angeles as it passed over Worcester, Massachusetts.

The hijackers then turned the plane north instead of south - heading towards New York airspace.

A veteran of an elite unit in the Israeli Defence Force who understood Arabic, Lewin appears to have immediately understood what was happening and challenged the terrorists, who were armed with box-cutters and knives.

It was an act of extraordinary 
courage which was to cost him his life. As the former commando fought 
with Satam al-Suqami, one of the five who had taken the plane, he was 
fatally stabbed.

Half an hour later, at 8.46am, the Boeing 767 became the first plane to crash into the Twin Towers. All 81 passengers, nine crew members and the two pilots died.

The story of Lewin's unimaginable bravery has only just been made public in a new biography No Better Time: The Brief, Remarkable Life of Danny 
Lewin, the Genius Who Transformed the Interne.

Author Molly Knight said she wanted to write about Lewin's life because she felt it deserved to be celebrated.

She told CNN: 'It was about the way he lived. I felt like if he was motivating me as much, I felt like I could do the same for readers.'

The
writer was able to piece together his last moments from the desperate 
accounts of two flight attendants who had been in contact with the 
ground as the tragedy unfolded.

Heroic:
Lewin was killed in his attempt to stop the five terrorists who took 
over Flight 11 before flying it into the North Tower of the World Trade 
Centre, pictured above shortly after the impact. Hijacked United 
Airlines Flight 175 can be seen to the left heading for the South Tower 
just before 9am on September 11

The moment that shocked the world: American Airlines Flight 11 was the first of four hijacked planes to crash at approximately 8.46am on September 11

They
told authorities that a passenger seated in 9B - now believed to be 
Lewin - had been killed as he tackled one of the terrorists.

Early reports by
the 9/11 Commission claimed that Lewin had been shot but after 
extensive interviews with officials on the ground who had spoken to the 
attendants, it was concluded that al-Suqami had slit his victim's 
throat. 

Lewin's best friend Marco Greenberg told Slate: 'He was the first victim of the first war of the 21st century.'

There were to be many more. Seventeen minutes after Flight 11 crashed, United Airlines Flight
175 hit the South Tower of the World Trade Centre at 9.03am.

Then
came the news that a third hijacked plane had crashed into the Pentagon
in Arlington, Virginia, before a final aircraft was brought down in 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

As
news of terrorist attacks spread around the world, it was Lewin's own technology which allowed the internet to keep up with
the increased amount of traffic.

The Israeli-American
co-founded Akamai Technologies which is responsible for more than
30 per cent of the world’s internet traffic.

His
company's October 1999 share market float made Lewin an overnight 
billionaire and he became one of the world's richest high-tech 
entrepreneurs before he was even 30-years-old.

The multibillion dollar company's clients today still include Sony, Apple and News Corp.

But before
his business success, Lewin, who was brought up in Denver, Colorado, before
moving to Israel with his family when he was 14, served with one of the
country’s most elite counter-terrorism unit, Sayeret Mat’kal.

After reaching the rank of captain, he decided to return to graduate school to study maths and computer science.

He studied at the Israeli Institute 
of Technology before going on to Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) on a full scholarship where he came up with a ground-breaking idea to allow the internet to work more efficiently and at faster speeds.

The
set of algorithms he created and called 'consistent hashing' formed the
basis of his company Akamai which he set up with MIT professor Tom 
Leighton in 1998.

Describing Lewin, Leighton told CNN:
'He was really exceptionally smart. MIT has a lot of really smart 
people, and Danny stood out even among that rarified environment.

In memory: A plaque for Danny Lewin on the fence of a park named in his memory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he studied at MIT

Gone but not forgotten: After Lewin's death, the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was renamed Danny Lewin Square in his honor

Success story: Danny Lewin created a set of ground-breaking algorithms which make the internet work more efficiently and formed the basis of his company Akamai which he co-founded with MIT professor Tom Leighton in 1998

'He liked working on the hardest problems, as opposed to the easier ones, because they would make more of a difference.'

He added he was intrigued by Lewin's idea because it would make a real beneficial impact on the world.

He said: 'In the area where we worked, in algorithms and the theoretical side of 
computer science, often that work is good, deep work, but it doesn't 
change the world. It doesn't impact people directly.

'With this work, we thought it would have relevance 
in the real world, and make the Internet be faster, more reliable, more 
secure. It was a chance that was pretty rare for us.'

Akamai is responsible for keeping some of the world's most popular websites running smoothly, including Facebook and iTunes.

Lewin
had boarded Flight 11, which took off shortly before 8am on September 
11, to attend a Akamai business meeting in Los Angeles.

After the terrorist attacks, almost every major news site remained up and running that day despite the hug volume of traffic because of Lewin's creation.

If he was still alive today, it is likely he would be placed in the ranks alongside Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.

Lewin is survived by his wife Anne and sons Eitan and Itamar.
