A German schoolboy's life has been saved by his parents who each gave up one of their lungs as he grew closer to death.

Marius Schneider, 12, is now on the mend after undergoing the historic op - the first of its kind undertaken in Europe - by specialists in Hanover.

Marius is a cystic fibrosis sufferer; victims often suffer chronic lung and respiratory problems. The only hope for him were donor lungs as he struggled for breath each day.

Cystic fibrosis is an incurable genetic condition making the body produce mucus thicker than normal which gradually fills the lungs, reducing and eventually stopping the ability to breathe normally.The condition, normally detected at birth or early childhood, carries the symptoms of salty tasting skin, poor growth and weight gain despite a normal diet, accumulation of thick, sticky mucus, frequent chest infections and coughing or shortness of breath.Cystic Fibrosis can be managed, but if the lungs decline to such an extent that a patient's life is threatened doctors may decide to perform a transplant. Finding a donor is tricky because people with CF must have both lungs replaced to prevent the remaining lung infecting the new lung with bacteria.

'We were desperately waiting for an organ, waiting for a call every day,' his father Lars said.  By the time of the operation in April he was surviving with the aid of a ventilator and a heart-lung machine.

He was flown to the hospital in Hanover on Friday April 13 from his home in southern Germany and had the operation 13 days later. 

'For him, 13 seems to be a bit of a lucky number,' added Mr Schneider.

'The transplant was his last chance,' said Dr Gregor Warnecke, the doctor in charge of his care. 'The hospital would not have operated on his parents if it had not been an absolute necessity.'

Professor Dr Axel Haverich, Germany's most famous transplant surgeon, said: 'Marius was already somewhere between heaven and earth when we operated. He was living in a state of almost perpetual anaesthesia.  But he is a real fighter. We had a team of 40 and he came through.'

Marius was lucky on two counts: both of his parents had compatible blood groups, and their lungs were bigger than his, which is necessary for a successful transplant.

'If we had enough organ donors in Germany, the doctors would not have to resort to living donors,' Mr Schneider said. 'We are happy and thankful that we and the doctors were able to help Marius.'

He and Marius’ mother Anja had no doubts about each donating a lung to save their boy. 'It was immediately clear what we had to do in order to save our son,' she said.

This or nothing: Dr Gregor Warnecke demonstrates how the operation will work. He had said the transplant was Marius' last chance

Crack team: Surgeons at the Hannover Medical University performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed from each parent and then implanted into Marius. The procedure took close to six hours

Surgeons at the Hannover Medical University (MHH) performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed  from each parent and then implanted into Marius. The procedure took close to six hours.

'The operations went well, the parents were able to leave hospital after ten days,' added Dr Warnecke.

'The transplantation worked well with Marius. We were able to remove the tubes from him two days after the operation.'

Marius was released from hospital after 155 days. And although his quality of life has improved enormously – he can play football and ride his bike – his immune system remains weak and he is being tutored at home.

Marius, whose sister Nele shares his love for Schalke football club, said: 'I am especially proud of my parents. They gave me their lungs so I could live. Now I can keep up with them on bike rides.'

While this was the first procedure of its kind in Europe, doctors say it will probably remain an exception because of the need for two donors at a time with the requisite blood groups.
