Custard creams have long been a staple of British teatime. 

So the news that Tesco has released a new custard cream spread priced at £1.99 was a big moment among biscuit-lovers across the country. 

A picture of one of the new pots was uploaded to Twitter yesterday, prompting a flurry of activity on the social networking site.

Tesco has launched a custard cream spread for £1.99 and the news prompted a flurry of activity on Twitter 

Fans of the biscuit were over the moon about the announcement, with many unable to contain themselves. 

One person wrote: 'Tesco is now selling custard cream in a jar #heaven'.  

However some biscuit lovers were not impressed. 

Stephen Pearce said: 'Just ruins a biscuit, wouldn't feel right on bread.'   

Although they are grabbing most of the attention today, custard creams are not the only biscuit to have been made into a spread by Tesco recently. 

Another retro teatime treat - the Bourbon has also been made into a paste.

The supermarket also created a cookies and cream spread and a cookie spread.

It follows on from the craze last year that saw Lotus Biscoff biscuits made into a spread that has gone on to be sold in most of the UK's supermarkets

The Femail team tried out the custard cream spread in the office and were pleasantly surprised with the results. 

We gave the paste a 7/10 for how close it resembled the original biscuit in taste, but struggled to think of many foodstuffs that it would work with. 

On toast, the spread could easily be too sickly, but it might work well with waffles and ice cream or a as a bread stick dip.  

Specialist dietitian Nichola Whitehead who runs the blog nicsnutrition.com said: 'The ingredients are biscuits then oil and sugar. 

'Far from nutritious and not a product that I would promote to adults or children at all. 

'You'd be better off eating a couple of biscuits than eating this spread on toast. 

'I would suggest sticking with a 100% nut butter as a healthier type of spread. 

'You can always add a touch of cocoa for a chocolate boost or banana for a naturally sweet addition. 

'The healthy fats, fibre and protein will help to keep you feeling fuller for longer in comparison with this sugar laden jar.'
