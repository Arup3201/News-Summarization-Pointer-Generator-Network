A Michigan father murdered his wife and 17-month-old son and then killed himself in a disturbing double murder-suicide, police say.

Police found the bodies of Patrick Gleason, 41, Lisa Herrera, 37, and the couple's baby boy, Max, inside their family home in Kalamazoo on Monday night.

Officers were alerted to the grim scene by relatives of Herrera's who went to check on the family after they hadn't been seen or heard from in up to a week.

Assistant Chief Brian Uridge told WWMT.com that reporting officers were horrified by the scene.

'I think when you add the variables of small children and realize that every one of those officers reporting to that scene are mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles themselves, I think it adds a whole new unfortunate variable,' he said.

Gleason, is a former Marine and Herrera,aÂ  school teacher, were married in 2010, and their son was born in February of last year.

Police don't have a motive in the devastating slaying and authorities have not given any details regarding how the three died, though neighbors said they were asked about gunshots.

'There does not appear to be any prior history, no overt indicators, nothing that would point you in the direction that this was even a possibility,' Uridge told Woodtv.com.

Gleason has no criminal history and no history of abuse, according to police records and neighbors said they had never noticed anything strange or suspicious about the family.

According to Woodtv.com, a status update on his Facebook page from May 15 read: 'i am writing a new song for my wife and its not real nice!'

Herrera's father told WWMT.com that 
he and wife were 'beyond distraught' after learning of the slayings and 
that they have not even begun to digest what has happened to their 
precious daughter and grandson.

Neighbor Max Lettow, who has lived in the area for 60 years, was shaken when news spread of the killings.

'That's terrible; absolutely terrible,' he told WWMT.com.

Lettow said the cars in the driveway hadn't moved for days, suggesting the tragic events may have played out some time ago.

The autopsies were being conducted Tuesday and Wednesday.

Crime scene investigators were at the family's home for more than seven hours on Monday.

Herrera was a speech pathologist at Lakeview Schools in Battle Creek.

Gleason's Facebook page said he was in the Marines from 1989 to 1993. He graduated from Greenville High School in 1989 and studied philosophy and history at Western Michigan University.
