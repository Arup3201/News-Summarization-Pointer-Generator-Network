A school has been forced to close for a second time after its first attempt to rid its £6million grass eco-roof of an infestation of mites has failed to stop them biting children.

Students at Walney School in Barrow-in-Furness were sent home on Friday after the pests found their way through vents in a new classroom block.

The mites spread through the school and jumped across tables - leaving staff and pupils with sore and itchy bites.

Ongoing issue: The mites have spread through the 700-pupil secondary school in Cumbria - leaving staff and pupils with sore and itchy bites

The 700-pupil Cumbria secondary school reopened on Monday after a full-scale fumigation was thought to have cleared up the problem.

However, students have now been sent home for a second time after it became apparent that the bugs - believed to be harvest mites - were still biting children.

Katherine Turner, whose daughter attends the school, said she felt its duty of care to students had been 'breached'.

She said: 'They knew about this a week ago. Parents should have been told earlier. It shouldn't have reopened until it was sorted.'

Irritable: Harvest mites sink in a small feeding barb to their victims and secrete a fluid into the wound. Their bites cause extremely irritating heat lumps which can last up to fourteen days

The influx of mites is believed to have emerged from the school's £6million eco extension, which comprises of ten classrooms and a new sports hall.

It opened 12 months ago, featuring ‘natural ventilation’ and a sedum grass roof.

The school's chairman of governors Dennis Laird said: 'On Friday afternoon, the interior of the building was treated by our contractor. The effect of this was assessed on Saturday afternoon and again on Sunday.

'These mites are extremely small and as far as could be discerned it appeared that the issue had been dealt with.

'However, upon reopening it became apparent that pupils were still being affected and the problem remained. Unfortunately we had to make the decision to reclose the school.'

Eco-friendly: Supporters of grass roofs say they provide efficient insulation while reducing rainwater run-off and providing a home for wildlife

Harvest mites, which favour sheltered areas of the body, sink in a small feeding 
barb to their victims and secrete a fluid into the wound which breaks 
down the human cells into food.

Their bites cause extremely irritating heat lumps, which can last up to fourteen days

A spokesman for Cumbria County Council 
said: 'Although a bite can be itchy and uncomfortable, harvest mites in 
the UK do not carry any diseases that present a risk to humans.

'The best
way to get rid of mites on the body is a hot bath or shower, and to 
make sure clothes are washed at a normal temperature.'

Parents
have been told the school will remain closed until at least Friday while experts attempt to control the situation.

Their aim is to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly development - but not all parents are fans of so-called 'eco-schools'.

This month, families have voiced their concerns about a £7million 'eco primary school' that, despite opening only three years ago, has started leaking so badly pupils have been forced to go into temporary classrooms for two years.

Controversial: Dartington Primary School (above) has started leaking so badly that pupils have been forced to go into temporary classrooms for two years

When Dartington Primary School in Devon opened its timber doors in 2010, it was applauded for its environmentally friendly credentials.

It was heated by solar power and its plumbing system relied on rain collected from the roof, which was made of locally-grown sweet chestnut.

However, the zero-carbon building turned out to be not quite as sustainable as the designers had hoped.

Now, a series of water leaks and mouldy walls have left pupils having to be taught in tents erected in the school grounds.

Tania Mountney, whose son attends the school, near Totnes, said: ‘There’s been leaking there ever since it opened. Last year we could see the roof was starting to warp.

'I went to a parents’ lunch and you could see these large patches of mould. My ex-partner is a builder and he couldn’t understand how it could get that bad.’

Meanwhile, a South Wales 'eco primary school' has banned pupils from bringing their bikes through the gates because of health and safety concerns.

Students at Risca Primary School in Newport have been told they must chain their bikes up off its premises amid plans to demolish cycle racks to make way for more staff parking.

Mother Ceri Jeffries, 32, has three 10-year-olds at the school and admitted she was surprised staff had taken the decision considering its 'eco' status.

'The school is an eco-friendly school but has decided that children are no longer allowed to cycle to and from school, even though children have been doing this for years, including myself as a child,' said the mother, whose children normally cycle together with four others, cutting their twenty minute walk down to a five-minute bike ride.

'This has upset a lot of children and their parents. Childhood obesity is on the rise and promoting healthy eating and exercise is a must.'

Last month, the 'eco-schools' initiative had been implemented in 55 countries, with more than 46,000 schools taking part.

Its aim is to raise students' awareness of sustainable and environmentally friendly development through classroom study and community action.
