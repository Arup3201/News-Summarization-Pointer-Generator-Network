A Scotland Yard chief bought champagne for a News of the World journalist and lunch for colleagues during a £600 one-day spree on his force credit card.

Andy Hayman, a former assistant commissioner in charge of counter-terror duties, said he took his 'top team' for a £566 meal at London restaurant Shepherd’s in February 2007.

The alcohol bill for the meal alone came to £188.50.

Champagne socialite: Ex-assistant commissioner Andy Hayman wined and dined journalists on regular occasions, the inquiry heard

Later that same day he spent £47 on champagne during a drink with a female journalist at the Oriel wine bar, in Chelsea.

Both bills were paid for on his American Express company card, the Leveson Inquiry into press standards heard.

Mr Hayman said the restaurant payment was paid for on his expenses as a colleague was joining another force.

He said he could not remember which NotW journalist he was drinking with at Oriel.

The police officer also had dinner at Soho House a year earlier with editor NotW editor Andy Coulson and deputy editor Neil Wallis.

Giving evidence, Mr Hayman said he would rather be facing questions over phone-hacking than terror atrocities.

He said: 'I feel terrible for the victims of phone-hacking and I would not minimise that.

Close relationships: Mr Hayman said he could not recall the purpose of a lunch with NoW journalists, but that it would have been related to the 'ongoing support that paper was giving to anti-terror'

'But at the same time, I’d rather be 
facing questions around that than I would be about more loss of life 
which, 7/7, was awful.'

The Met chief quit his job a month after an investigation into his expenses was launched.

But he became a columnist for News International paper The Times after retiring from Scotland Yard, for which he was paid a £10,000 per year retainer.

Robert Jay, QC, said: 'When asked about it, you stated that you recall that this was a Crime Reporters' Association representative, possibly from the News of the World. It could have been a female whose name you did not know.'

He was asked whether this might have been Lucy Panton or Rebekah, who took over from Panton, but said he could not recall.

Mr Jay suggested the champagne incident was evidence that the police had gone 'too far' with socialising.

He was criticised by MPs last July for 
having dinners with News International journalists while inquiries were 
ongoing - with one Tory MP on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee 
suggesting he would have appeared a 'dodgy geezer'.

Mr Hayman then dismissed as rubbish the suggestion they were 'cosy candlelit dinners'.

The police watchdog cleared him and fellow police chiefs of misconduct over his roles in the original phone hacking investigation.
