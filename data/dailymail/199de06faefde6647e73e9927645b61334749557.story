Wes Allen is used to staying cool behind of his race car, so much so that even a near-decapitation didn't stop him from completing the course.

Stunning footage shot from Allen's vehicle during the Columbus, OH., race over the Fourth of July weekend captured the heart-pounding moment when a rival car flew over his head.

Allen was pulling into a 130 mph turn when the almost fatal accident occurred.

He was on the seventh lap with six other cars competing when he bumped the vehicle in front of him, slowing both Formula Ford cars too fast for the vehicle behind them to react in time.

'I felt it. I knew I was in for it. I didn’t know what was going to happen,' Allen told the Daily News. 'I had an ominous cloud over my head.'

Allen, 55, is an experienced driver and president of the Lexair Inc. manufacturing company in Lexington, Ky.

The video shows Allen's car bumped as the shadow of the car behind him begins to overtake his head.

In fractions of a second the competing vehicle goes airborne and soars above Allen's head, narrowly missing him.

Allen keeps his cool to drive through chaos

Though barely perceptible in the video, Allen barely moves his head at a crucial moment.

'If I hadn’t ducked my head would have hit the car,' he said.

As the cars spun around him, Allen kept his cool and maneuvered his vehicle around the wreckage to continue the race.

'I thought I could pass four cars right there,' Allen said.' I grabbed the gear and went.”

Unfortunately he damaged a tire in the accident and had to pull into the pit crew to end the day.

'If a car had not passed over me I would have gotten them all,' he said.
