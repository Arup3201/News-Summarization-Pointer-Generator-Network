Reports of a marmalade theft and a chicken walking down a road are some of the hoax calls that one police force has received.

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has released audio recordings of the calls in the run-up to New Year's Eve in an effort to encourage people not to abuse the emergency 999 number.

Other examples of inappropriate calls made to GMP's call handlers include a dog following a woman into her house and someone reporting the killer involved in a recent Emmerdale storyline.

Ringing in the New Year: Police are urging the public not to make hoax emergency calls over the New Year

GMP's call handlers receive an average 1,371 calls each day, and on New Year's Eve last year this figure reached 3,016.

Diane Grandidge, GMP's business lead for call handling, said: 'Christmas and the New Year are the busiest times of the year for our call handling team.

'We receive thousands of emergency and non-emergency calls which is why we would urge those making silly prank calls or thoughtless requests to think twice.

'It is these thoughtless acts and deliberate jokes that can cost lives as that single action can have an impact on the swiftness of the police's response to a real emergency.

'I would urge everyone to think carefully before dialling so that our call handlers can focus their efforts on real emergencies as they happen. You wouldn't want your own call being delayed by a hoax so why have someone else's?'

The hoaxer who reported the Emmerdale story gave his name as 'Alan Sugar' and that he was reporting the murder of Carl King.

He said: 'Chaz has been done for it right, but it was....what's he called, Cameron... Cameron did it and Chaz is going to get sent down. I know she has got a bad haircut and all that, right, but she shouldn't go to prison just for having a dodgy haircut should she?'

The call ends after the man is warned that he could be committing an offence.

For general inquiries or to report non-urgent crimes, people are asked to dial 101.

For example, if a car has been stolen, property damaged, to report a traffic collision or to give police information about crime.

The 101 number is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and there is a single flat rate charge of 15p, no matter how long the call, the time of day or whether the call is made from a landline or mobile.
