Long-term smokers find the taste of cigarettes they bought in plain-packaged cigarettes to be worse than branded cigarettes.

A study of 51 smokers by the University of Newcastle also found that participants can no longer differentiate between brands, saying that since the introduction of plain packaging in Australia in 2012, all cigarettes now tasted the same.

The study's co-author and PhD candidate, Ashleigh Guillaumier, said because tobacco companies have denied changing the ingredients in their products, the study's findings highlight the power of branding.

'It's one of the main reasons that the tobacco industry fought so hard against the introduction of plain packets,' said Ms Guillaumier.

'They have spent a lot of time building up their branding and know how influential it is on people's perceptions and experience of the product.'

The researchers investigated the impact of the new one-colour packets dominated by vivid health warnings by conducting group discussions with smokers before and after plain packaging was introduced on December 1, 2012.

'They couldn't discern a difference between brands now and they thought the quality of the tobacco had deteriorated,' Ms Guillaumier said.

'That was a consistent talking point that people really agreed on in the groups sessions.'

Co-author Associate Professor Billie Bonevski said the study supports the introduction of plain packaging legislation and provides ammunition for other countries that want to take up the policy.

Conducted by the University of Newcastle (pictured), the study correlates with figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which show a significant decrease in tobacco sales since the introduction of plain packaging

The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released figures which appear to show a significant decrease in tobacco sales since their introduction.

In December of 2012, figures show that $3.508 billion was spent by consumers on tobacco. In March of this year, the expenditure on tobacco products was $3.405 billion.

But the three major Australian Tobacco companies - British American Tobacco Australasia, Philip Morris Australia and Imperial Tobacco Australia - have all seen a 30 percent jump in profit since the hardline plain packaging laws were introduced.
