The New York realtor who jumped into a tiger's den at the Bronx Zoo to 'be one' with the animals will face trespassing charges in court this week as his mother claims that the cat who mauled him may have saved his life.

David Villalobos, 25, now walks with a limp after being attacked by Bachuta, a 400-pound, 11-year-old Siberian tiger.

'I'm OK,' he told reporters outside his Putnam County home.

Healing: David Villalobos walks with a limp after being mauled last September by a 400-pound tiger

On September 21, Villalobos had his 
back bitten, where a fang punctured his lung, and his body clawed, after
throwing himself from a moving monorail over a protective fence into 
the tiger's enclosure.

Now his mother says that it may have 
been a blessing in disguise, claiming that Bachuta actually exposed her 
son's bad reaction to medications.

'He was always interested in animals,and we brought
him up as a Christian, but Adderall changed his way of thinking,' 
mother, Fernanda, told the Web site Lawyers and Settlements in November.

'I'm almost getting my son back,' she told the Post.

Villalobos is hoping to write a book on his wildlife experience.

'This is a good thing that happened,' he was overheard telling friends working out in a gym.

'Maybe I can make some money, write a book.'

The Post also said he was bragging, 
saying that the media won’t stop calling him, according to a source, 
adding, 'He said he gets calls from people all over the world.'

According to the report, Villalobos also said 
he was worried about losing his real-estate license because of the 
stunt.

Villalobos, 25, of 
Mahopac, New York was arraigned Friday in a Bronx courthouse and pleaded
not guilty to trespassing charges. He returns to court March 12.

In a court complaint, 
police Sgt. Peter Monopoli says that when Villalobos was asked why he 
jumped, he said, 'Everyone makes choices and we have our reasons in life
why we do things.'

He told another investigator, 'I was testing my natural fear, you would not understand,' the complaint says. 'It is a spiritual thing, I wanted to be at one with the tiger.'

The trespasser also claimed that 
despite his serious injuries, he was able to pet the tiger before 
zookeepers came to his rescue, said New York Police Department spokesman
Paul Browne.

Police had said earlier that 
25-year-old Villalobos admitted to a police officer making a conscious 
decision to jump from an elevated train into the animal's den, but that 
his motives were unclear and an arrest uncertain.

That later changed when, during an 
interview at the hospital, Villalobos told detectives that 'his
leap was definitely not a suicide attempt, but a desire to be one with 
the tiger,' Browne said.

The mauling happened
in the Wild Asia exhibit featuring a train with open sides that takes 
visitors over the Bronx River and through a forest, where they glide 
along the top edge of a fence past elephants, deer and a tiger 
enclosure.

Passengers aren't strapped in on the 
ride, and Villalobos apparently jumped out of his train car with a leap 
powerful enough to clear the 16-foot-high perimeter fence.

Villalobos was alone with a male 
Siberian tiger named Bashuta for about 10 minutes before he was rescued 
by zoo officials, who used a fire extinguisher to chase the animal away,
said zoo director Jim Breheny.

'When someone is determined to do something harmful to themselves,' Breheny said, 'It's very hard to stop that.'

Bashuta was returned to a holding area where it usually sleeps at night and was not be euthanized, zoo officials said.

'The tiger did nothing wrong,' Breheny said.

'The tiger was minding his own business,' New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told ABC News, 'up until the man cleared two sets of fences to get into the enclosure.'

But his family, who had no idea he had gone to the zoo, were perplexed as to what went wrong.

'He’s amazing and he loves everybody,' the victim's sister told The New York Daily News. 'I really don’t know what happened.'

Officials believe Villalobos was
visiting the zoo by himself. He had recently posted photos of tigers on
his Facebook page, including one of a mother licking her 
cub.

The Bronx Zoo, one of 
the nation's largest zoos, sprawls over 265 acres and contains hundreds 
of animals, many in habitats meant to resemble natural settings.

Its exhibits include Tiger Mountain, Congo Gorilla Forest and World of Reptiles.

There are 10 tigers at the Wild Asia exhibit, but Bashuta was the only one on display at the time of the attack. Bashuta has been at the zoo for three years.

There are no surveillance cameras in that area of the exhibit.

Zoo officials said they would review safety procedures but believe this was a highly unusual occurrence.

'We review everything, but we honestly think we provide a safe experience,' Breheny said.

'And this is just an extraordinary occurrence... somebody was deliberately trying to endanger themselves.'

He added: 'I think it's safe to say that if the tiger really wanted to do harm to this individual, he certainly would have had the time to do that.'

Breheny applauded his staff for acting quickly in the extraordinary situation, adding that the man was lucky to escape Bashuta with his life.

'We were able to prevent a bad situation from turning into a real tragedy,' Breheny said.

'We did not have to use deadly force but we were prepared to do so. We’ve never had a single incident like this. You have to be determined to jump out,' he added.

Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest of the big cats and can weigh up to 674 pounds.

Although rare, deadly animal attacks in zoos across the country have happened before. On Christmas Day 2007, a man was killed at the San Francisco Zoo, when a 300-pound tiger named Tatiana escaped her cage and savaged him.
