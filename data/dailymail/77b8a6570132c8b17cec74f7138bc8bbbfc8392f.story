Britain's biggest water company paid no corporation tax last year despite imposing inflation-busting price rises on millions of customers.

Thames Water made profits of £549million last year after sales rose six per cent to £1.8billion.But the Australian-backed group, which serves nine million customers in London and the Thames Valley, paid nothing in corporation tax – and even received a £5million tax credit.

It comes after Jonson Cox, head of regulator Ofwat, said bumper profits and complex company structures that help reduce tax were ‘morally questionable’.

Martin Baggs, chief executive officer, of Thames Water, says tax payments are being delayed while Thames Water invests in infrastructure

Earlier this year Thames Water was embroiled in a scandal after it emerged the group financed some of its operations through the Channel Islands.

It also provoked fury last year by imposing a two-month hosepipe ban in April, despite England receiving record rainfall in the period.

The company’s annual report, published yesterday, showed its boss Martin Baggs received £1.1million in pay and perks for the year.

The chief executive saw his basic pay rise £25,000 to £450,000 and also received a bonus of £274,000.

He will receive a further £366,000 next month under the group’s long-term incentive scheme.

Precious: Annual bills for customers have jumped by 15 per cent, well above inflation

The report revealed water leaking from the group’s pipes rose to 646million litres a day. Sewer floods increased 55 per cent to 549 times.

The group ranked bottom of Ofwat’s table of customer service levels last year.

The company is owned by Kemble Water Holdings, and its main investors are controlled by Australia’s Macquarie bank.

Its customers saw their bills rise by 6.7 per cent last year. They face another crippling hike in rates, with a 5.5 per cent increase due later this year.

Mr Cox said some privately-owned water firms avoided taxes by using complex structures to push money abroad.

‘At the same time, hard-pressed customers have seen annual bills rise by 13.5 per cent since 2010, while their incomes have fallen,’ he said.

He added: ‘Tax policy is not for an economic regulator and these structures may be legal and common in private equity.

‘But some aspects are morally questionable in a vital public service.’

Thames Water said its tax bill was reduced because of the amount it spends every year plugging pipes and improving drains. It spent £1billion on this last year, allowing it to whittle down its taxes.

It also used tax losses from other parts of the group to reduce its bill even further.

The group also spent £400million in interest payments for its £8.4billion debts, and paid £231million to shareholders in dividends during the year.

Mr Baggs said: ‘We have not paid much corporation tax in recent years because the Government’s tax system allows us to delay, not avoid, payment of tax based on how much we invest.

‘Because we are investing £1billion a year from 2010 to 2015, more than any water firm in the UK’s history, we are able to defer a lot of tax payments to future years.

‘Thames Water contributes around £150million annually in other tax, including business rates and national insurance.’
