Project Underskin: The next big thing in wearable technology may be a tattoo implanted in the skin

From smartphones to Google Glass, this past decade has brought a wave of new technology and technological advances, and in the next five years, those advances are expected to go beneath the surface -- literally.

The next big thing in wearable technology may be a tattoo implanted in the skin, according to Fast Company. 

The folks at NewDealDesign, the San Francisco-based design company behind the Fitbit Force wellness watch, drafted a mock-up of the  tattoo for Fast Company's Wearables Week.

They called it 'Project Underskin.' 

The foundation of Underskin would be a visible tattoo implanted in the knuckle of the thumb and a larger, invisible tattoo implanted in the palm, according to Fast Company.

The tattoo would interact with everything the consumer touches and would recognize the consumer's location as well as movements within the body. 

The sub-dermal tattoo will run off of the body's electro-chemical energy and will have the ability to monitor blood sugar, exchange information through a simple handshake, unlock front doors, protect credit card information by allowing use only when the card is in the owner's hand, glow when holding hands with a loved one and more, according to Jaeha Yoo, Director of Experience Design at NDD.

Human: Gadi Amit, the CEO of NDD, said that with the sub-dermal tattoo 'we'll actually become more human and more free'

As far as privacy goes, Fast Company reports that the tattoo would encode the consumer's data into a shape specific to that person, like a thumbprint. 

Gadi Amit, the CEO of NDD, said in a CNet interview that electronics 'will become inherent to our existence,' he used mobile phones as an example and described them as 'the most personal object you have.' 

'They won't be gadgets. they'll be who we are and what we are,' Amit told CNet. 'People immediately jump to the conclusion that we’ll be cyborgs. Actually, my goal in designing is that we won’t be cyborgs. We’ll actually become more human and more free from the technology.'

Amit told From The Grapevine that Underskin is in the concept stages now and is simply a vision for what Wearables industry will look like in the next five years.

There are no prototypes or contracts as of now. 

Though a sub-dermal tattoo has never been done and marketed, Yoo said that there is a lot of cultural precedent for the idea. 

“When we started working on it, everyone was a little squeamish about implanting something...' Yoo said, 'Obviously tattoos, piercings--people are implanting birth control. This stuff is going on now. It’s not a huge step forward to implant something like Underskin.'

Thumbprint: The tattoo would encode the consumer's data into a shape specific to that person, like a thumbprint.

Though the innovators say this new technology will help people become more' human' and 'free,' some have already expressed their concerns about the tattoo.

One Tumblr user posted in response to the NDD's unveiling of Underskin and wrote: 'My immediate thought: Employers could brand their employees, with the argument they’ll need a smart tattoo to enter the workplace!'

Other comments on the Fast Company's site have included statements like 'It would be misused...' and 'No thanks....a bit too Orwellian for me.'
