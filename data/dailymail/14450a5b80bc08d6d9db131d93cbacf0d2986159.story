Cristiano Ronaldo insists he has no regrets about playing in the World Cup despite carrying an injury and refuses to use it as an excuse for his below-par performances in Brazil.

Portugal were eliminated at the first hurdle after finishing third in a group containing eventual winners Germany, the United States and Ghana.

Ronaldo, who was crowned the best player in the world for a third time at Monday's Ballon d'Or gala in Zurich, only managed to score once in three World Cup games - during Portugal's only win against Ghana.

There were fears the 29-year-old would miss the tournament all together after struggling with a knee injury towards the end of the season with Real Madrid.

But Ronaldo played through the pain to represent his country last summer and the former Manchester United man revealed he would do it all over again.

'I've no regrets about what I did, as things happen for a reason. After winning the Champions League, for which I was injured - I had to sit out training for two weeks ahead of the final because of pains – I headed off to the World Cup,' Ronaldo told FIFA's official website.

'I could've told the coach not to consider me. I could've headed off on holidays instead without the worry and it would've been easier for me. Nobody would have been able to talk about me out there. 

'However, I like to face up to things directly. First of all, I don't want to use the fact I was injured as an excuse but it's true that I wasn't 100 per cent, as many people knew, and some didn't want to know but, as I said, I'm not making excuses. 

'That I'm here today is down to my sacrifices, dedication and the sweat off my brow.'
