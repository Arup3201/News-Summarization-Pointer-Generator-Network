Cross-Channel ferry passengers are being warned of possible disruption to services tomorrow due to potential industrial action at the Port of Calais.

Officials at the Port of Dover have been alerted about potential strike action taking place in northern France between 8am and 6pm local time.

Passengers are being urged to travel ahead of the possible action amid concerns long queues could form on roads approaching the Kent port.

Strike action by workers at the Port of Calais will once again severely affect journeys from Dover

A Port of Dover spokesman said: 'It is unclear how severely services may be affected.

'The Port of Calais does intend to keep a number of berths open for use throughout the day, although the number may be less than usual.

'Customers wishing to travel on Monday are strongly advised, where possible, to travel ahead of the possible action period.

'The Port of Dover, together with its major ferry partners, will do all that it can to minimise any customer delays and community impact but some disruption should be anticipated from a situation beyond its control.

'Due to the current high volumes of seasonal traffic and the potential disruption, there may be queues on the approach roads to the Port of Dover.

'Customers are therefore advised to allow plenty of time for their journey and the community should consider using alternative local routes to move around the area where possible.'

Travellers are urged to contact their ferry operator before travelling or visit the Port of Dover website or its Twitter account for the latest information. 

P&O state on their website: 'As a precaution, day trippers are advised not to travel but to change their bookings for another day.

'If you still wish to sail we will do everything we can to minimise any delays, but some disruption is to be expected.

'P&O Ferries clearly regrets a situation beyond its control and will endeavour to keep any delays to a minimum.'
