The five-year-old girl left orphaned after her beauty queen mother and British dad were shot dead in Venezuela has been given the shattering news about their horrific deaths and has left hospital to attend their funeral, it was revealed today.

Tragic Maya Spear is being comforted by her grandparents and extended family after being treated for a gunshot wound to her leg.

Yesterday, the brother of former Miss Venezuela, Monica Spear Mootz, said the family had yet to tell Maya that her mother and father, Thomas Berry, were dead.

Despicable: Maya was also shot by the robbers who killed her mother and father in cold blood. The brave girl has now left hospital and been given the crushing news they are dead

Support: Maya is in the care of her parents' extended families and who she will ultimately live with has yet to be decided. Her paternal grandfather told MailOnline: 'We
 will discuss it with her family once the parents have been seen off 
properly'

But on her release from hospital the bewildered little girl was told the shattering news.

The couple were gunned down during a robbery on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway in Venezuela's Carabobo state on Monday. Maya was in their car with them and suffered a glancing wound to her leg during the robbery.

She was treated in hospital but did not require any surgery.

Family members arriving in Caracas from Florida, where most of Monica's family now live, told MailOnline that Maya had been allowed to leave hospital and was being cared for by her mother's cousins.

She is now expected to attend the funeral of her 29-year-old mother and ex-pat British father on Friday in Caracas.

Her fate has yet to be decided, according to her 
grandfather.

'We still 
don’t yet know whether Maya will remain in Caracas with us or go to 
Orlando to live with Monica’s parents', said Thomas Berry Sr, speaking 
at the lying in state ceremony in Caracas’s East Cemetery today.

'We
 will discuss it with her family once the parents have been seen off 
properly,' he said. 'For the moment Maya is staying with some of Monica’s
 cousins in Caracas. The most important thing is that she is safe'.

Grief: The bodies of Berry and Spear were open for public viewing on Thursday at the Eastern Caracas Cemetery ahead of a funeral tomorrow

Mourning: Two cousins of Monica Spear attend the cemetery where her body and that of her brother are lying in state. Her brother, Ricardo, right, addressed the awaiting press outside

Crowds: Huge numbers of people turned up to the cemetery to pay their respects. The deaths have sparked protests and convulsed the crime-ridden country

The couple's five-year-old daughter Maya survived the shooting after being hit in the leg and is recovering in a Caracas hospital, although she doesn't yet know that her parents are dead

The
 pair, who were never formally divorced, were taking a New Year holiday
 as a family following more than a year’s estrangement which many thought was a sign of reconciliation.

'They
 truly loved each other, and their daughter only cemented their love”, 
said Monica's father, Rafael Spear, who had flown in from his home in Orlando to attend 
his daughter’s funeral.

Monica was an American citizen, and although she had spent the last few years in Venezuela, where she is a TV star, she had lived with her parents for years and was a graduate of the University of Central Florida.

'We all expected them to return from holiday 
with the news tat they were back together again'.

The
 camera bag belonging to the murdered Miss Venezuela Monica Spear has 
been found in the possession of the only woman arrested in connection 
with the case.

Several family members caught at 6am flight from Miami to Caracas to join up with others who had been flown to Venezuela on a jet chartered by the country's president.

Maya is being looked after by her cousins and also Rafael and his wife, Inceborg, and Berry's parents Tom and Kate who live in Caracas.

The bodies of Berry and Spear were open for public viewing on Thursday at the Eastern Caracas cemetery.

Loving: Former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear Mootz and Thomas Berry had maintained a good relationship following their divorce and family say they were close to getting back together for the sake of Maya

Hundreds of mourners are expected at the funeral on Friday as Spear was well known in the south America country having been named Miss Venezuela in 2004.

She also appeared in a popular soap opera which brought her an even bigger fan base.

As family members made final preparations for the funeral new details emerged about the gang alleged to have carried out the brutal killing.

The only woman among the six arrested was found to have Spear's camera bag in her possession.

The female bandit is known as Eva "Guns" Mejias.

Authorities were quizzing Mejias and six men aged from 15 to 26.

The group which believed to have carried out the murder acted from a building where they were squatters known as El Churro, a notoriously dangerous government project in the region.

Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in

Brutal: The gang, known as the 'Los Rapiditos', wasted no time in gunning down the couple in front of their daughter

Theft: Police revealed today they recovered Spear's camera bag from a female member of the alleged gang

Trap: Police believe the killers deliberately left something in the road to cause a puncture on their car

Residents of El Cambur, the village close to the squatters den, have told local press that their lives had been ruined by the invasion of the building by the dangerous gang a few years ago.

'Before we could go where we wanted, but since they moved in and established a "Red Zone'.

'I have to take a different route home at night to avoid it?, one resident of the sector told El Nacional.

'There are police and military patrols on the highway, said  Mary Gonzalez, another resident of El Cambur. But there is no phone signal, a lot of places to hide and although everyone knows where the gang is squatting no one has done anything about it'.

'It's only now that this tragedy has occurred that they have done anything.'

The couple and Maya are believed to have been targeted by the robbers after they left an obstacle in the road, causing the car to tire to puncture. A tow truck arrived and was being loaded onto it when the armed gang approached.

It is believed the couple locked them inside and the gang fired through the windows, killing them and injuring Maya.

The only two witnesses to the crime are two men from the road rescue team who fled for their lives as the couple were in the car.

The deaths of the couple has outraged millions in the crime plagued country.

The country's President Nicolas Maduro has promised a crackdown on crime in a nation that had more than 24,000 homicides last year.

Love: Relatives said they told Monica to return to the US. but said she was so in love with the country and wanted to teach her daughter about it

Maduro called for a security meeting with all the country's governors and the mayors of the 79 cities with the highest crime rates.

'If there's any sense to this pain, it has to be so that we all wake up,' he said.

Police chief Jose Gregorio Sierralta said they were killed after locking themselves inside their Toyota Corolla to stop their attackers stealing their car as the tow truck driver and an assistant ran to a police checkpoint a mile away for help.

Monica's family told NBC News they had
 tried and failed to persuade the former beauty queen, to leave violence-racked Venezuela and join them in the 
United States after she was robbed six times.

'She loved her country too much,' said her brother, Ricardo. 'It was her home.'

Her ex-husband shared her passion for Venezuela and worked as an adventure tour operator.

He moved to the U.S. about 15 years ago after being shot, but returned to Venezuela in 2006, his business partner said.

'I
 think he was kind of naïve because he loved what he did and he loved 
showing the good side of Venezuela,' Luis Dominguez said.

People gather in a demonstration in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, to protest over the death of Monica Spear

'To think there are people who can 
shoot a mother and father in front of their daughter is very sad and 
unbelievable,' family friend Diego Sanchez said. 'And it's shocking when
 it happens to someone you know.'

As well as Maya's grandparents from Orlando, Berry's parents Tom and Kate were at her bedside.

Berry's sister Katie, who lives in Edinburgh, was expected to join her retired university maths professor dad and mum.

She and her brother moved to Venezuela as young children but she returned to Britain to find work with her Venezuelan husband.

Mr Berry, 39, a travel firm boss, also used to return regularly to Britain to see family and friends.

Another family member described Ms Spear as a 'sweet young girl.'

'She was so sweet, just like you see her in the photos,' said her aunt Mayela.

'She was as beautiful a person on the inside as she was on the outside.

'She was very loving and dreamed of triumphing in French cinema after spending time in France where she learn't the language.

'There was no need for what happened. There's no respect for life anymore.'

Spear
 and her ex had spent the New Year on a road trip that took them from 
scenic Merida to the beach and to the plains, where the beauty queen  
was raised on a ranch, rode horses.

A video she posted to Instagram showed her blowing kisses to the camera on horseback.
