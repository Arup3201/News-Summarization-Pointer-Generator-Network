Pensioners could be forced to spend 
£150,000 of their own money before receiving any government help with 
care bills, it emerged today.

The elderly would still face huge bills for residential care despite the Government's plan to cap costs at £72,000.

Labour
claimed its calculations showed that many people will die before 
reaching the cap, but ministers insisted it was taking much action which
Labour failed to take when in power.

Costs: Elderly people will have to fund tens of thousands of pounds in charges which are not covered by the government's car cap

The planned cap does not
cover accommodation and living expenses which pensioners would still 
have to pay while care costs only count towards the limit at the rate 
the local council would pay for a place in a residential home.

Labour
says it will take almost five years for elderly people to hit the cap -
during which time they will have clocked up more than £150,000 for 
their actual residential care home bill.

The
cap is due to come in from 2016-17, when councils will charge an 
average of £522-a-week for residential care is estimated to be £522 a 
week.

But the average price 
of a care home bed will be £610 a week, creating an £88-a-week shortfall
which people will have to pay themselves.

Pensioners
in care homes will also have to pay £230 a week for their 
accommodation, which is counted separately from care costs and does not 
count towards the cap.

In 
some areas of the country with higher average care home costs, people 
could face paying more than £500,000 before the cap was reached.

Health Minster Norman Lamb dismissed Labour's complaints, arguing they failed to act when in power

In parts of Surrey a bed in a 
standard residential care home typically costs around £800 a week, but 
local council rates are around £326 a week.

The difference would mean a resident must spend more than £560,000 over 12 years before seeing costs capped.

Labour also estimated that six out of seven elderly people will have died before they reach the cap.

Shadow
minister for care and older people Liz Kendall told the Daily 
Telegraph: ‘David Cameron has repeatedly claimed that no-one will have 
to pay more than £72,000 to pay for their care, but this simply isn't 
the case.

‘On average, 
pensioners will have to pay more than twice this amount, and the vast 
majority will have died before they hit the so-called 'cap'.

‘David
Cameron should be straight with elderly people about what they will 
really have to pay for their care. Families deserve to be told the 
facts, rather than being conned, so they can properly plan for the 
future, and not have the Government attempt to pull the wool over their 
eyes.’

But health minister 
Norman Lamb hit out at Labour's inaction on tackling the problem of 
crippling care costs while they were in power.

The
care and support minister said: ‘It's rank hypocrisy for Labour to 
criticise the coalition's care cap when they did nothing to fix an 
unfair social care system in 13 years of plenty.

‘At
the same time as dealing with Labour's debts, we have gone further than
they ever did and found £2 billion to cap care costs and end the 
scandal of people being forced to sell their home in their lifetime to 
pay for care.

‘Of course we 
would love to be able to afford to go further, but we won't take any 
lectures from the party who racked up a record budget deficit and forced
old people to sell their homes to pay for care.
