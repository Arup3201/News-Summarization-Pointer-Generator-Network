A Sunderland supporter could just be the unluckiest fan in Britain after watching his side get thrashed 8-0 at the weekend  - for the third time since 1968.

Cass Farrar, 69, was devastated after the Black Cats were crushed by Southampton in the Premiership on Saturday, marking an unhappy hat-trick for the father-of-three.

The retired headteacher has witnessed all three of his team's huge 8-0 losses since the club's first 46 years ago.

Mr Farrar first saw the team humiliated by the same score during an away game at West Ham's Upton Park, on October 19, 1968.

He is a member of London's branch of the Sunderland Supporters' Association and had been living in the capital for two years when he saw Geoff Hurst rack up six goals, while fellow World Cup winner Bobby Moore, and Trevor Brooking took it up to eight.

The second 8-0 defeat came at Watford on September 25, 1982, which he also attended to witness Luther Blissett put four past the Wearsiders' goal, with Ross Jenkins and Nigel Callaghan scoring two each.

But despite his bad luck Mr Farrar, now of Greenwich, London, is sticking by his team.

He said: 'It was abysmal. The floodgates were opened so easily.

'Some people say "I'm never going again" but I've already got my ticket for Crystal Palace. I'll be going.'

Speaking about the latest game, he said: 'Vergini, well I sort of blinked and he put it in the Sunderland goal after 10 minutes. I thought 'What was that all about?'

'Mannone didn't have the best of games so he's probably to blame for two or three goals and then Bridcutt ran in.

'Southampton were so slick and I think we made them look good.

'I like Lee Cattermole and it looked like he'd given up and some of the others as well, but it was a shock.'

He said one of his most vivid memories of the West Ham game include the goalscoring headers by England hero Hurst. 

And at Watford, he was haunted by a screen which beamed out an image of three yellow footballers dancing to celebrate a home score.

'It was set off eight times that day, so it was like it was up there all the time,' he said.

Cass, is married to school teacher Bethan, 67, and dad to Lucy, 33, Sarah, 31, and James, 27 - an actor who played Liam Gilmore in Hollyoaks, also a Sunderland fan.

Cass is helped in his bid to get tickets by Peter Robinson, who was in the year above him at Ryhope Grammar School, taking in about 20 games a season.

He attended Saturday's match with Barry Emmerson, from Whitburn, and a classmate, and Barry's son Martin, a cricket commentator for BBC Newcastle.
