Valencia claim they have rejected a £26.7million bid for defender Nicolas Otamendi.

Manchester United and Arsenal have both made checks on the Argentina defender who has been in excellent form this season but Valencia insist they will not negotiate.

They have inserted a £38.2m buyout clause in his contract and insist that it must be met.

Valencia have rejected a £26.7m bid for Nicolas Otamendi - Arsenal and Manchester United are interested

Valencia have inserted a buyout clause of £38.2m on the Argentina defender

Otamendi was a target for David Moyes while at United a year ago but Porto sold him to Valencia in a deal that saw him loaned initially to Atletico Mineiro in Brazil as he was a non-EU player.

Otamendi's ownership is understood to involve the Doyen Sports Group who also had a share in Marcos Rojo's rights prior to his move to United from Sporting Lisbon.

The new Valencia owner Peter Lim is a United fan and has a 50 per cent share with the Neville brothers, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes at non-league Salford City - but he is putting significant investment into the Spanish club and is reluctant to lose key assets.

Otamendi is contracted to Valencia until 2019 and wants to lead them back into the Champions League. His idol is the former Valencia and Argentina defender Pablo Ayala. 

West Bromwich Albion have asked about Fiorentina left back Marcos Alonso.

The 24-year-old had a successful loan spell with Sunderland last season and played a pivotal role in helping them steer clear of relegation.

He has featured regularly for Fiorentina this season but they are willing to listen to offers and may allow him out on another loan. The former Bolton and Real Madrid player has been used in midfield also by coach Vincenzo Montella.

A few changes are afoot at Albion as manager Tony Pulis steps up his interest in £6m-rated winger Callum McManaman at Wigan.

Albion are ready to terminate the loan of Porto winger Silvestre Varela and allow him to join Parma. The Italian side are also signing Cristian Rodriguez from Atletico Madrid.

Olympiacos, meanwhile, are showing interest in Joleon Lescott.

The centre-back missed the first four games of the season but has been an ever present in the league since. Albion want another defender and a striker.

Burnley want Albion midfielder Graham Dorrans but have yet to make a bid.

Wigan's Shaun Maloney, a target for Leicester, QPR and Celtic, is poised to join Chicago Fire if they agree a £1m fee as he remains under contract until the summer.

Reading manager Steve Clarke will attempt to bring Glenn Murray back from Crystal Palace to the Madejski Stadium.

Clarke, who also wants to sign Stoke defender Robert Huth on loan, is offering around £2m for Murray who helped Palace launch their comeback at Burnley on Saturday.

Palace are continuing negotiations with Blackburn Rovers over a deal for Rudy Gestede on Monday and hope to complete the £5m deal. Clarke hopes that allows him the chance to prise Murray away.

Meanwhile, Reading's Royston Drenthe is in talks to join Turkish side Erciyesspor.

Crystal Palace scouts ran the rule over Watford's Ikechi Anya and Troy Deeney on Saturday.

The pair were in action against Charlton. Palace want a winger and a striker and have targeted Bolton's Chung-Yong Lee as well as Gestede but South Korea international Lee has a hairline fracture of his leg and will be out for three weeks.

Leicester have made a late enquiry about taking Lloyd Dyer on loan from Watford. The 32-year-old was poised to sign for Birmingham on loan on Monday until the end of the season. Bolton had also asked about Dyer.

Watford are signing Serbia defender Vujadin Savic on a short-term deal. Birmingham have confirmed that French midfielder Guy Moussi will not have his contract renewed at the club.

Sevilla have shown a surprise interest in Manchester United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard.

The Dane, who is sporting a newly shaven haircut, knows that he is surplus to requirements following the signing of Victor Valdes and his representatives have been discussing opportunities at new clubs. He is available now and out of contract in the summer. 

Sevilla want a new keeper and believe Lindegaard could still revive his career in the right environment. He is one of a number of players they have in mind.

Chelsea are holding a meeting on Monday to discuss the offer from Roma for Mohamed Salah.

Jose Mourinho protested that he could not let the Egyptian go because he has a small squad following Saturday's 5-0 trouncing of Swansea.

Mourinho would like Chelsea to get another player in if they let Salah out.

The Egyptian has made seven appearances this season but is in dispute with lawyer Oliver Kronenberg who was involved in his transfer from Basle. Salah tweeted on Sunday: 'Please don't take any news from my ex agent Oliver Kronenberg and don't believe any of his words.'

Roma have offered Chelsea £1m to loan Salah with view to a £11.5m permanent transfer.

Salah has interest from Besiktas, Inter Milan, Hamburg and Sunderland but is keen on the idea of a move to Rome.

Chelsea beat off interest from Liverpool to sign Salah from Basle for £11m a year ago but he has been on the periphery of the squad, making just seven appearances this season.

He was on the bench at the Liberty Stadium and is eager to get more game time.

Aston Villa and Liverpool are watching Lewis Cook at Leeds United. 

The 17-year-old played 78 minutes of Saturday's draw against Birmingham and was watched by Villa scouts who are looking for bargains to bring into their squad. 

England Under 18 international Cook has made 25 appearances for the Elland Road side in a difficult season and has the trust of coach Neil Redfearn who has watched him develop through Leeds' academy.

Ipswich Town are signing former Leeds goalkeeper Paddy Kenny on Monday. The 36-year-old is joining until the end of the season.

Wolves have made a £500,000 offer for Zulte Waregem forward Idrissa Sylla.

The 24-year-old is out of contract in the summer and currently on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Guinea.

Blackpool have had a £30,000 offer for Partick Thistle's Stephen O'Donnell rejected. The 22-year-old right back is out of contract in the summer.

Swansea have had an offer of £5.5m rejected for Stuttgart midfielder Alexandru Maxim. 

Sportsmail reported Swansea's interest in the Romania international last week but they hope to have more success in negotiations with Norwich after their bid went in for Martin Olsson.

Bafetimbi Gomis has declared he may still leave but that could depend now on Borussia Dortmund following up their initial interest. They want a striker in their bid to stay in the Bundesliga.

Talking to Canal Plus, Gomis said: 'It is one of the possibilities (leaving) yes, it is one of the possibilities. It is planned that my entourage will meet with Swansea’s representatives. 

'Then I will have a discussion with my representatives to find the best solution. I want to stay abroad. It is true that I have had not a bad amount of approaches from clubs. There are strong possibilities that I remain in one of the major leagues but, to come back to Turkey (one of the journalists previously mentioned it), they have done good things in the Champions League recently. 

'There have been approaches yes. For the moment I am concentrated on Swansea. Especially after the heavy defeat on Saturdayit would show a lack of respect to the club (to discuss specific clubs).'
