Team news

Newcastle

Under-pressure Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will have to rely upon the same group of players which capitulated at Southampton last weekend as he looks for victory over Hull.

Pardew will once again be without midfielders Siem de Jong (thigh) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) with the former facing months on the sidelines.

Striker Papiss Cisse is closing in on a return from a long-term knee injury, but fellow frontman Adam Campbell (hernia) is likely to be missing for some time and full-back Davide Santon is still out as he continues his recovery from a knee problem.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Dummett, Haidara, Coloccini, Williamson, S. Taylor, Tiote, Anita, Abeid, Gouffran, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, Obertan, Ameobi, Riviere, Perez, Armstrong.

Hull

Hull will make a late check on record signing Abel Hernandez ahead of Saturday's visit to Newcastle but expect him to be ready for action.

Hernandez scored on his debut against West Ham but manager Steve Bruce admits he was left exhausted by his introduction to English football and will assess his match fitness on the morning of the game.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

None of the last six competitive meetings between Hull and Newcastle have ended as a home win (four away wins and two draws).

Indeed, the Tigers have won on four of their last five trips to St James’ Park in all competitions (L1).

Newcastle have scored only 17 goals in the Premier League in 2014, fewer than any other ever-present side this year.

Hull are just one of five teams to score in all four of their games this season (along with Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton & Swansea).

Newcastle have lost eight of their last 12 Premier League games at St James Park (W3 D1).

Sone Aluko scored the winning goal for Hull last season in their 3-2 victory at Newcastle

Hull have scored at least once in eight of their last nine Premier League away games.

Hull have made more clearances than any other side in the PL this season (186).

Alan Pardew now has the same Premier League win percentage at Newcastle (36%) as he did at West Ham.

Steven Taylor is the only player to feature in the Premier League this season and not make a single pass.

No Newcastle player has been caught offside yet this season in the Premier League, despite playing four games.
