A man has been warned he could yet face jail for lurking behind women as they bent over supermarket freezer counters and used a hidden camera to film up their skirts, a court has heard.

James Webster, 35, took photos as his victims leaned against the display cabinets in the aisles and eventually attracted suspicions as other shoppers saw him moving the bag he was carrying so that he could get a clear up-skirt view.

Today Webster was waiting to discover his fate after magistrates ordered a pre-sentence report to be carried out by the probation service.

The court heard that an upset shopper alerted management who found the 35-year-old, who sports long dreadlocks with beads weaved through them, positioning his hidden camera underneath another woman's skirt as she leaned over a freezer.

Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could covertly film between women's legs.

Prosecuting, Joanna McGlew told magistrates in Slough, Berkshire, that an upset shopper had noticed the dreadlocked voyeur and raised the alarm.

'The defendant was in Lidl in Maidenhead,' she added. 'A shopper was observing him and he saw him acting in an odd manner.

'He saw the defendant crouching down and Mr Webster kept moving a bag, which he kept with him, under the skirt of a girl and the girl seemed unaware of this.

'He then saw a lens protruding from the satchel. He was upset by this and reported it to management.'

She told the court that the store manager arrived to see Webster trying to slide the spy camera bag under the skirt of another woman leaning over in the freezer section.

'He saw a female customer bend over one of the freezer aisles and saw Mr Webster manoeuvre a bag to a position under the girl's skirt,' Miss McGlew added.

Webster, who at the time was living in shared accommodation in White Waltham, near Maidenhead, Berkshire, was confronted by security guards and tried to cover the lens before denying any wrong-doing.

However, after seeing an appeal for witnesses to the crime in a local newspaper Webster, who now lives with his parents on the outskirts of Norwich, turned himself in to police.

Webster admitted one count of outraging public decency by covertly filming up women's skirts in the Lidl store in January.

Wearing a big black jacket, black trousers and shoes, he spoke only to confirm his name, address and plead guilty to the charge yesterday.

However, Francis Domingo, defending, insisted Webster felt ashamed and remorseful for his actions and appealed for a community sentence.

'When he was interviewed by police not only did he make admissions but he also said his actions would be considered lewd, obscene and disgusting and the women involved would be highly upset and embarrassed,' Mr Domingo added.

'Throughout the interview he was very tearful and remorseful. This is a man who has clearly faced up to his actions.

'He was close to tears as he told me he just wishes he could turn the clock back and wishes it had never taken place.'

Mr Domingo told the magistrates that as soon as his client left the store he threw the camera away in disgust at himself.

He also said that Webster, now of Marsham, near Norwich, had been smoking cannabis around the time of the incident, but was now clean.

'As soon as it happened he said to himself 'Oh my God, what am I doing?' and threw the camera away in disgust,' he added.

'He clearly has a conscience. He listened to his conscience and surrendered himself. This should be pitched in terms of a community level.'

The court adjourned the hearing until next month  to give probation time to compile a pre-sentence report on Webster.

Webster was released on conditional bail, however, presiding magistrate Anne Brown warned him that all sentencing options remained open.

'We are going to ask for a pre-sentence report and you will have to cooperate with probation services,' she added.

'We are going to ask for a look at all the options. We are going to leave open all options.'
