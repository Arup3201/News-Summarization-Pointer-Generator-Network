It's been a boom time for sellers in Australia's real estate market in the past year, which saw prices soar by eight per cent across capital cities in 2014, but that big balloon is expected to deflate somewhat in the next 12 months.

Sydney and Melbourne led the way, with the harbour city market soaring 12.4 per cent year-on-year and the Victorian capital up 7.6 per cent. The CoreLogic RP Data Hedonic Home Value Index showed an overall increase in capital cities of almost 0.8 per cent for 2014.

But with a renovated garage going for $1.4 million and a squatters shack uninhabited for 25 years bringing in the same cash, did buyers get any bang for their big bucks?

This run down property in Sydney's Balmain East sold for $2.68million, $83,000 above the reserve price, in September. The high price may have had something to do with the property being on the waterfront

 Part of the boom is a waterside property in the suburb of Putney, which just been sold.

Hobart, in fact, had the biggest increase in the last month of the year, registering a jump of 2.7 per cent across all housing types but the median price there is still the lowest for the capital cities, at $341,000..

And while market analysts agree that home price rises are going to slow, if you're looking for a place in Sydney it's still going to cost you a median price of up to three-quarters of a million dollars.

While Sydney is the most expensive, Melbourne's average comes in at just under $600,000.

Overall, capital city home values were up again in December by 0.9 per cent, and were up 7.9 per cent  for the year 2014, according to the CoreLogic RP Data home value index.

RP Data senior research analyst Cameron Kusher told AAP that despite the strong result the pace of home price growth continues to slow.

Brisbane remains one of the more affordable major cities, with the median price for a home still well below half a million dollars. Sydney is by far the most expensive at almost $750,000

Overall, capital city home values were up again in December by 0.9 per cent, and were up 7.9 per cent for the year 2014, according to the CoreLogic RP Data home value index

'The slowing annual growth rate is further evidence that the housing market is losing some steam with combined capital city home values increasing by 9.8 per cent over the 2013 calendar year compared to a more moderate 7.9 per cent increase in 2014,' he said.

'Auction clearance rates reduced noticeably across the two largest auction markets, Sydney and Melbourne, over the final two months of the year.'

Unit prices in the harbour city have also jumped significantly in the past year, up more than 8 per cent

CommSec chief economist Craig James believes the housing market is cooling because there are more homes being built.

Mr Kusher added that as home values have been rising, rental growth is sitting at its lowest annual rate in more than a decade, with capital city rents up by 1.8 per cent over the past 12 months.

Perth is one of four Australian capital cities with an average home price of more than $500,000 in 2014

He expects it to stay sluggish in 2015.

'Affordability hurdles in Sydney, and to a lesser extent in Melbourne, are making it increasingly difficult for some buyers to enter the market,' he said.

'Additionally, low rental yields and the likelihood of tougher lending criteria to investment buyers will likely dampen the very active investor segment of the market which may in turn reduce housing demand in 2015.'
