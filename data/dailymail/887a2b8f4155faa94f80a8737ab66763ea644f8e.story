When Paula Broadwell wrote the biography of her lover David Petraeus, she managed to keep out any hint of their relationship from the book.

But when Saturday Night Live took on the notorious relationship during the opening sketch of last night's show, they reimagined it as a significantly more steamy tome similar to bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey.

The irreverent comedy showcase featured comic Cecily Strong portraying Broadwell giving a reading of her biography of the former director of the CIA, with a surreal erotic twist.

Mocking: Cecily Strong played Paula Broadwell in a sketch on Saturday Night Live

Parody: 'Broadwell' read from a pornographic rendition of her biography of David Petraeus

The fictional Broadwell was holding a genuine copy of All In, the fawning biography of Petraeus published earlier this year, as she read in front of a crowd of stuffy politicoes.

But she immediately launched into a filthy rendition of her extra-marital liaison with the general, supposedly started when she was shadowing him during his time as head of the western forces in Afghanistan.

The extracts began with sincere comments about military matters such as the troop surge and counter-insurgency efforts.

However, they then descended into aggressively explicit descriptions of her relationship with Petraeus, as she described her telling him, 'You are a dirty girl, Paula. You're my dirty girl.'

Strong also praised a group of soldiers who 'barely seemed to notice as General Petraeus and I went at it like a pair of rutting baboons behind a Jeep barely 50 yards away.'

Obviously disgusted by the surreal reading, the sketch showed nearly all of the audience walking out - leaving just Fred Armisen remaining, with a creepy grin on his face.

Returning to the well: Jason Sudeikis played Wolf Blitzer in a sketch mocking Florida socialite Jill Kelley

The show then turned its comedic guns on Jill Kelley, the Florida socialite who inadvertently exposed the scandal when she reported threatening emails she had received from Broadwell to the FBI.

Strong read an invented extract from the book describing her and Petraeus spying on Kelley using a military drone.

She said that the general asked, 'Would you like to be with a woman like that?

'You know, she has a twin sister.'

As the sketch became increasingly more explicit, it faded out after Strong began another extract saying: 'Like most people, I have always had mixed feelings about erotic aspyxiation.'

Seth Myers tossed out a series of witty one-liners about the scandal during the 'Weekend Update' segment of the show, describing it as 'a sexy new reboot of You've Got Mail'.

He joked that one of the big winners from the story would be 'whoever writes the next biography of Petraeus', as he would be able to include details of the scandal itself, adding: 'Reading the Broadwell biography is like reading a biography of Batman before his parents died.'

Star: Guest host Jeremy Renner played 'Fat Douche Derek', the 'self-proclaimed mayor of Tampa'

Joke: Tim Armstrong took part in a fake dramatisation of video footage featuring Kelley

Myers pointed out that Petraeus' downfall was an ominous warning for 'people trying to have affairs in the digital age', saying: 'You can't get away with it - even the director of the CIA couldn't get away with it.'

And he mocked Kelley's involvement as he said her description as a 'Tampa socialite' sounded like 'a 1920s euphemism for prostitute' and quipped: 'Sex scandals are like Jewish New Yorkers, eventually they all make their way to Florida.'

Unsurprisingly, SNL returned to the week's biggest news story later in the show, with Jason Sudeikis playing CNN's Wolf Blitzer in a sketch mocking the media's coverage of the case.

He introduces Kelley - also played by Strong - walking out of her house, then shows the video again, commenting that she is 'seen here in the same clip doing the same thing because it's the only footage we have of her'.

The seconds-long clip was played several times, then replaced with a deliberately shoddy 'dramatisation' of the clip with Kelley played by Tim Armstrong.

Sudeikis also conducted an interview with 'Fat Douche Derek', the 'self-proclaimed Mayor of Tampa', played by guest host Jeremy Renner, who when asked about Kelley would only say, 'She fine,' and replied to a question about Petraeus and General John Allen by saying, 'Who they?'

Allen was roped in to the controversy when it exchanged that he and Kelley had apparently exhanged thousands of emails after becoming acquainted while he was serving at Central Command in Afghanistan.
