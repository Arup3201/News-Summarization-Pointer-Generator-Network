Andre Schurrle insists he has no regrets about the forced nature of his departure from Chelsea, claiming he needed to leave Stamford Bridge in order to play regular football again.

The Germany international, who has joined Bundesliga side Wolfsburg for a club record fee of £24m, admitted that he wanted to remain with the Premier League leaders but knew he faced an uphill struggle to retain his place.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho opted to play Oscar, Eden Hazard and Willian as a three just behind central striker Diego Costa, squeezing the German World Cup winner out of contention.

The Germany international was unsurprisingly the centre of attention as he arrived at Wolfsburg 

But as he was unveiled as a Wolfsburg player on Wednesday, the 24-year-old, who has signed with the German club until 2019, said he matured at Chelsea.

He said: 'I wanted to stay but the last weeks or last month I tended towards changing something because I wanted to do what is fun for me and that is to play football.

'I could only do it briefly at Chelsea in the past week. I will never regret this [playing for Chelsea].

'I still love this club, the staff are amazing. I developed my game. I improved myself there. I was a different player when I came to Chelsea. It helped me a lot.'

Schurrle arrived at Stamford Bridge in June 2013 from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee in the region of £18m.

Taking the No 14 shirt, he played 43 matches duuring his first season and scored nine goals, though Chelsea missed out on any silverware.

But despite returning from the World Cup in Brazil with a winners' medal, Schurrle found opportunities harder to come by this season.

When it became clear Chelsea wanted to sign the Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina, Schurrle had to be moved on to ensure the club's January dealings fell within Financial Fair Play regulations.

His return to the Bundesliga was completed on Deadline Day on Monday and he joins the side who are closest to Bayern Munich at the top of the table.

Wolfsburg sporting director Klaus Allofs was pleased with his signings: 'We want to improve the team step-by-step.

'When you get a chance to sign a player, a World Cup winner like Andre who has already proved his worth in the Bundesliga, then you have to do it.

'The financial aspect has been made into an issue but an engagement of this size makes sense. I don't think we are breaking the bank if you look what is happening around Europe.'
