The world according to Google's autocomplete is a hilarious place in which Britain becomes 'a trap' and France is 'bacon'.

The search giant's autocomplete function throws up what users have really been searching for - and they range from the accurate and the offensive to the surreal and the bizarre.

Some are suggested when a place name is simply typed into the search box, while others appear when a computer user keys in the location followed by 'is'.

Europe is... A map featuring alternative names for the countries of Europe based on Google's autocomplete search function predictions

Map makers have been having fun replacing place names with their online alter egos to create alternative maps of the world.

They include a map of Europe by Buzzfeed.com, with some of the substitutions appearing to be apt descriptions, such as Iceland being replaced by 'bankrupt' and Sweden by 'expensive'.

France becomes 'bacon', Britain is labelled 'a trap' while Italian food means the country is turned into 'Eataly'.

However, others such as Ukraine being 'weak', Estonia swapping with 'poor' and Albania making way for 'bad', may not be looked upon with such good humour by patriots there.

The website also produced a map of New York, featuring 'state of mind' instead of Chelsea, 'filled with high rollers' in place of Upper East Side, 'dangerous' filling in for Spanish Harlem, and 'more liberal' appearing where Uppper West Side should be.

The maps were inspired by Matt Shirley, from Flipcollective.com, who used Yahoo autocomplete to draw up a 'United States Is...' map.

'Racist' appears instead of Arizona, 'stupid' comes in for Idaho and 'flatter than a pancake' replaces Kansas, in his creation, while florida makes way for 'crazy', Tennessee is replaced by 'nice but it ain't Texas' and Rhode Island is helpfully swapped with 'not an island'.

Autocomplete functions are designed to help the internet user find information quickly by throwing up a number of predictions.

The predictions are based on previous searches made by all web users as well as those who have used the computer performing a particular search.

The search engines also base their predicted results by scanning the contents of websites.
