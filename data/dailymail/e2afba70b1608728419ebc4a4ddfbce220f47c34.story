Two people have been treated in hospital after being bitten by Britain's most venomous spider in south London.

A man and a teenage boy in Sutton needed treatment after they were bitten by the notorious false widow species.

It comes as there has been an increase in reported sightings of the false widow, Britain's most venomous spider, and more reports of people being bitten.

William Fraser, 14, was bitten (left) at his home in on Thursday evening by a spider that is believed to be a false widow (stock image, right)

The creature is capable of delivering a painful bite that usually causes a burning sensation and swelling but can lead to more severe symptoms including nausea and even loss of consciousness.

Wildlife experts believe that long term climate change could be leading to spiders setting up home in new areas, but that many people were mistaking the common house spider for a false widow.

They are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns on their backs.in the borough in recent months.

The so called 'outbreak' of sightings has intensified with people spotting the creatures in their homes and gardens all over Sutton.

William Fraser, 14, was bitten at his home Benhill Road on Thursday evening by a spider that is believed to have got into his bedroom. 

He woke the following day with a small bite mark on his forearm but by the time he got home from school on Friday his condition had worsened.

Mother Sarah Fraser said: 'The whole of his forearm had swollen from elbow to wrist.

Alexander Giordano, 39, of Broomloan Lane in Sutton, was bitten on his shoulder and wrist

His arm started hurting and his hand went numb and, as a childhood leukaemia sufferer, his immune system is weak so he went to A&E

'We
 gave him an anti-histamine and paracetamol. The next day he seemed to 
get better but on Sunday he just got worse and worse. He was feeling ill
 and he had to go to bed.

'We got him up to St Helier and the doctors and nurses hadn't even heard of false widows.

'When we showed them the article [in the local paper] the doctor seemed very concerned and wanted to keep him in overnight.'

In the end William was allowed home following a strong dose of penicillin and his condition has improved.

Alexander Giordano, 39, of Broomloan Lane in Sutton, was bitten on his shoulder and wrist.

His arm started hurting and his hand went numb and, as a childhood leukaemia sufferer, his immune system is weak so he went to A&E to be checked over and was put on a course of antihistamines, antibiotics and cream for the affected areas.

Spider experts say the animals only usually bite when threatened and if people are bitten they are best to treat the bites themselves and stop them from becoming infected.

Conservation officer Greg Hitchock, who works at the Kent Wildlife Trust , called for calm over the false widow.

He said: 'Lots of people said they have been absolutely sure that the spiders they have seen are false widows, but theyâ€™re not at all.  Itâ€™s not that straight-forward.

'The problem with sipders is that they are unpopular and not manypeople study them.

'Many of the "sightings" reported are probably not false widows at all.

'I think long term, global warming could have led to an increase in the spider population.

'But any warm winter weather we had last year was followed by a very harsh March.'
