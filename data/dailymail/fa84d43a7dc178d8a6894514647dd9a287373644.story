He travelled the country during the independence referendum, proudly defending the Union while standing on upturned Irn-Bru crates.

But Jim Murphy's fondness for Scotland's 'other' national drink means that taxpayers have been forced to fund his habit – handing over the princely sum of £1.30.

Parliament bosses have uncovered two claims from the Scottish Labour leader in his Westminster expenses following a Freedom of Information request, it emerged today.

Labour leader in Scotland Jim Murphy has claimed Irn Bru on expenses

Under existing rules, MPs – who earn £67,000-a-year - are allowed to claim for non-alcoholic drinks during overnight stays.

Mr Murphy, who does not drink alcohol, is a huge fan of Irn-Bru and purposely chose to tour the country with the branded crates as he visited 100 towns and cities in 100 days before the referendum. 

He endured heckling from Yes voters and was hit with eggs while speaking in Kirkcaldy, Fife, sparking claims that independence campaigners were 'orchestrating a campaign of intimidation'.

His expenses claims were both ridiculed and criticised yesterday.

A spokesman for pressure group The TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This is ludicrous and will leave taxpayers fizzing with rage. Expenses are supposed to be to help MPs do their job, not for caffeine-heavy refreshments or PR stunts.'

An SNP spokesman said: 'Labour's bottle has crashed and this is a further embarrassment for Jim Murphy. Unlike Scotland's favourite national soft drink – he is neither 'original' nor 'best'.'

Nationalist politicians took to Twitter to mock the Labour leader, with Europe Minister Humza Yousaf posting a picture of himself drinking Irn-Bru with the caption: 'Pleased to say I always buy my own Bru.'

MSP Mark McDonald ‏joked: 'I cannot believe that story about Jim Murphy claiming for Irn-Bru. I had no idea he even liked the stuff. There were no clues to this.'

A Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: 'As most people know, Mr Murphy drinks bucket loads of Irn-Bru. Over the years it's thought that he has single-handedly kept the House of Commons Irn-Bru supplier in business. He has paid for it himself except for these two cans totalling £1.30.'

In response to the unknown individual who requested the information, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority wrote: 'Under the MPs' scheme of business costs and expenses, MPs may claim for the cost of purchasing food and non-alcoholic drinks where they have necessarily stayed overnight neither in the London area nor their constituency. This is limited to £25 for each night.

'MPs may also claim reimbursement of the costs of an evening meal (excluding alcoholic drinks), when they are required to be at the House of Commons because the House is sitting beyond 7.30pm. This is limited to £15 for each night.

Irn Bru has been described as Scotland's 'other' national drink

'In processing your request, we have searched through all claims made by Jim Murphy MP for food and drink for any which identify Irn Bru. We have identified two such claims. Both claims were made before April 30, 2014, and amount to £1.30.'

A spokesman for Irn-Bru makers A.G. Barr declined to comment.

The revelation comes just weeks after it emerged that SNP MSP Richard Lyle charged taxpayers for his £1.80 bill in an Edinburgh fish and chips shop.

Originally, only the price-tag was released by parliament bosses, sparking a hilarious guessing game on social media about what he bought for the paltry sum.

Now, a Freedom of Information request by the Scottish Daily Mail has finally revealed what Mr Lyle purchased at the Royal Mile chippy.

An order for 'small chips' was made at 10.43pm in April 2013, the receipt shows, which the MSP - who earns nearly £59,000-a-year – later took the time to formally submit to Holyrood authorities, where it was processed by taxpayer-funded staff.

Expenses documents show that Mr Lyle, a Central Scotland MSP, is fond of his takeaway dinners. As well as claiming for chips, he clawed back a £5.40 bill from the Happiness Chinese restaurant on four occasions in 2013-14.

And seven other receipts for an evening meal were submitted from an unknown restaurant or takeaway, each priced just £4.20.

An SNP spokesman said: 'Members are permitted to claim some money towards meals on evenings when parliamentary duties mean they must stay in Edinburgh.

'The claim of £1.80 is in line with the Scottish Parliament allowances system, which has already been reformed and has always been more stringent and transparent than its Westminster counterpart. By definition, Mr Lyle's claim for an evening meal was as cheap as chips.'
