They have appeared in countless news articles and are regulars on TV, but now famous faces have been captured using bacteria.

Celebrities including Stephen Fry and Carol Vorderman have had their portraits grown using their own bacteria to blur the boundaries between science and art.

American microbiologist and photographer Zachary Copfer created the portraits using a swab covered in bacteria from the celebrities’ armpits.

American microbiologist and photographer Zachary Copfer creates portraits such as Albert Einstein's (pictured) using a swab covered in bacteria

American microbiologist and photographer Zachary Copfer created the portraits using a swab covered in bacteria from the celebrities’ armpits.

He took a digital photograph of the stars which was made into a negative and placed over a petri dish.

Mr Copfer then shot through the layers with radiation to burn away the bacteria in places leaving the image to emerge over 48 hours.

In order to create the portraits, he took a standard digital photograph and turned it into a halftone, which is an image created entirely by dots.

In a secret process, the image was then used to create a negative and was placed over a petri dish of bacteria.

Mr Copfer then shot through the negative with radiation to burn away the bacteria in places on the petri dish, according to the shape of the photograph.

He then placed the photograph in an 
incubator for 48 hours, to let the Bacteriograph emerge.

Mr Copfer is the only person in the world 
practicing this art, which he calls 'Bacteriography' and this is the first 
time his work has been brought to the UK.

Children's TV presenters Dick and Dom 
also had their portraits created, along with Hollyoaks star Kieron 
Richardson and Bang Goes the Theory presenter Liz Bonnin.

Zachary Copfer said that his methods are often a fusion of contemporary artistic and modern scientific practices. This close-up of a portrait of Albert Einstein is not part of the exhibition but shows the level of detail possible using the unusual technique

The celebrities took part in the experiment to promote The Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair, where the pictures will go on show.

‘As a patron of The Big Bang Fair, engaging young people in science, technology, engineering and maths is a very big part of what I do,’ said former Countdown star Carol Vorderman.

‘It was great fun taking part in this project, and the portrait looks brilliant - it's definitely one of a kind.

‘I hope that by showing young people the interesting and unusual ways that science can be applied, they're inspired to discover more about science and engineering careers for themselves.’

The fair takes place in March at the NEC in Birmingham and is aimed at encouraging young people to get involved in science and engineering.

Mr Copfer said: ‘I'm particularly excited that my work will be a big part of the fair's central aim to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers - and hope that my work will not only help get young people excited about science but that it will also encourage them to apply the scientific knowledge they gain in fun and unique ways.’
