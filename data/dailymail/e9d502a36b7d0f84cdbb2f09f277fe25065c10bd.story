Convicted rapist Ched Evans will not be returning to Sheffield United after the club retracted its decision to allow him to start training with them

Sheffield United have said convicted rapist Ched Evans will not be returning to train at the club following public outcry over the decision.

Presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron over the decision, Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, and two shirt sponsors had threatened to walk.

Evans was released from jail last month after serving half of a five-year sentence for rape, but has refused to apologise to his victim or accept his guilt.

In a statement, Sheffield United said: 'After ongoing and extensive deliberation, Sheffield United Football Club has decided to retract the opportunity for its former player, Ched Evans, to use the Club's facilities for training purposes, as was previously intended. 

'The Club initially accepted a request from The PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced.

'As noted in previous statements from the Club, the legal system of this country provides for both the punishment and the rehabilitation of every person who has been found guilty of a crime. 

'Sheffield United will not be used to promote the view that professional footballers should be treated differently, as has been the wont of certain sections of the media and various commentators.

'In addition, we remain disappointed at some of the inaccurate reporting, misinformed views and commentary, as well as the actions of a minority of individuals on social media. 

'Professional footballers must be treated as equals before the law.

'The club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms. 

'The club is aware that Ched Evans is pursuing legal recourse via the Criminal Cases Review Commission in the determination he has to clear his name. 

'We trust that he will be afforded a fair hearing.'

Speaking to MailOnline, Roz Hardie the chief executive officer of campaign group Object, said: 'We congratulate Sheffield United for listening to public opinion and reversing their previous decision. 

'Ched Evans is an unrepentant convicted rapist . Footballers are critical role models for young men and women in particular. 

'Offenders have a right to rehabilitation but Ched Evans had been set to return to top flight football when he has shown no remorse for his crime. 

'Indeed he has used his profile to persistently claim his 'innocence' in the media and re-traumatise his own and many other victims.' 

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who is MP for Sheffield Hallam, tweeted: 'A sensible decision by Sheffield United regarding Ched Evans. Step in the right direction.' 

Charlie Webster, who resigned as a patron during the row, wrote on Twitter: 'Sheffield United have done the right thing by not letting Ched Evans train with them. It's the right thing for the club, its fans, its community and the victim.

'(Sheffield United) is a great club with a fantastic history and now its future can be fantastic too.'

Evans was accused of rape in 2011 after having sex with a 19-year-old woman, who cannot be identified, at a hotel near his home town of Rhyl, Denbighshire.

Fellow footballer Clayton McDonald took the woman back to the hotel room before texting Evans, who arrived later.

Evans had tried to claim the intercourse was consensual but a jury found otherwise. Mr McDonald was cleared of the same charge.

Since his release  Evans has continued to deny his guilt and is appealing the judgement.

Meanwhile the victim has been forced to change her name and move away from her home after Evans' supporters 'outed' her online, breaching her right to anonymity as a victim of a sex crime.

Evans girlfriend Natasha Massey, who was dating him at the time of the attack, has defended his actions and the pair are now engaged.

Her millionaire-businessman father is believed to be behind a PR campaign and website to have Evans cleared, and has said the former-footballer can have a job at his firm if sport will not welcome him back.

DJ Nick Conrad was forced to apologise on air today after saying women should 'keep their knickers on' while discussing the Ched Evans case

The development came on the day that a BBC radio presenter who said women should 'keep their knickers on' while discussing the Evans case apologised on air.

Nick Conrad, a talk show host on BBC Radio Norfolk, made the comments during a live debate about the issue.

After criticism from some listeners and rape campaigners, he began this morning's show by saying sorry.

He came under pressure on social networking sites for him to apologise on his programme.

The 29-year-old said: 'I made it clear on several occasions that rape is an abhorrent and inexcusable crime and that women who are victims are in no way to blame.

'Some of my comments in one section of the discussion were ill-judged and were offensive to some. I apologise to anybody who was offended by what I said.'

In his original comments, Conrad said: 'I think women need to be more aware of a man's sexual desire that when you're in that position that you are about to engage in sexual activity there's a huge amount of energy in the male body, there's a huge amount of will and intent, and it's very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm.

'And it's the old adage about if you yank a dog's tail, then don't be surprised when it bites you.

'Or you can't keep snakes in the garden and think they'll only bite your neighbours.'

Rape Crisis England and Wales said Conrad's remarks were the latest example of a public figure making 'ignorant comments'.

Some Twitter users compared him to a real-life Alan Partridge - a reference to the Norfolk-based comedy radio presenter's politically-incorrect comments.

Conrad went on to suggest that feminists had 'hijacked' or 'jumped on' the debate and appear to be 'anti-men'.

May 30, 2011: CCTV shows footballer Clayton McDonald meeting victim outside a kebab shop in Rhyl at around 4am, before taking a cab with her to a nearby Premier Inn. On the way he texts friend Ched Evans to say he's 'got a bird'.

Mr McDonald and Evans both had intercourse with the girl, and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window.

After waking up in the hotel room with no memory of the incident, the victim went to police, and later the same day Evans and Mr McDonald are both arrested.

July 26, 2011:  Evans and Mr McDonald are charged with rape, which they both deny.

April 11, 2012: Evans and Mr McDonald take the stand for the first time at Caernarfon Crown Court.

April 20: Mr McDonald is acquitted of rape, while Evans is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.

During the trial Evans told the court that he had gone to the hotel after getting a text from Mr McDonald, and let himself into the room where he found the pair having sex.

He claimed to have watched them before having sex with the victim himself, while two other men watched through the window and attempted to film it.

April 23: The victim is named for the first time online by supporters of Evans, who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to 'virtual GBH'.

Officers subsequently take the unusual step of giving the woman a false identity and moving her to away from her home - protection usually reserved for high-profile murderers released from jail.

August: Evans has request to appeal his conviction turned down, though this is later overturned by the Court of Appeal in London.

November, 2013: Evans continues to deny guilt and recruits new legal team to help clear his name.

October 17, 2014: He is released from jail after serving half of his sentence and returns home to Rhyl where a bouncy castle is pictured being delivered to his parents' house, but is later taken away. 

October 18: Reports surface that Evans has been offered a £500,000 contract to re-sign for Sheffield United, though the club later deny the rumours. 

November 11: After a request from the Professional Footballers' Association, Sheffield United agree to allow Evans to return to the club to train, but refuse to say whether he will be signed.

The same day patron Charlie Webster, who was abused as a child, walks away from the club.

November 12: Lindsay Graham, another club patron, cuts her ties with the club along with another unnamed patron as 150,000 sign petition saying Evans should not be allowed to play again.

November 13: Jessica Ennis-Hill asks for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, leading to abuse on Twitter.

November 17: Karl Massey, the millionaire father of Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, says he will offer the former-footballer a job at one of his firms if the club will not have him back

November 20: Sheffield United confirm that they have withdrawn the offer to allow Evans to train at their ground.

November 22:  The Ministry of Justice said while it cannot comment on individual prisoners, in general terms the terms of a sex offender's licence would render it near impossible to work abroad, scuppering any hopes that Evans may be signed overseas for the remainder of his sentence.
