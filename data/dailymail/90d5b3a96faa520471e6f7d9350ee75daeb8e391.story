A woman became trapped under a three-tonne horse-drawn tram at an event to mark its £45,000 restoration.

The 46-year-old was dragged under the 20ft-long tram by her legs after the horse bolted along Middleton Railway, in Leeds, at around 3pm yesterday.

It was the first time in 112 years that the original tram had been pulled along the city’s tracks at the Festival of Transport event.

Firefighters had to push the vehicle along the tracks to release the woman before she was taken to Leeds General Infirmary.

It is thought the woman, who underwent surgery last night, suffered two broken legs. 

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has began an investigation into the incident.

Built in 1898 the 7ft-high double-decker Leeds horse car 107 was painstakingly restored after it was found being used as a summerhouse in an East End Park garden during the 1970s.

Around 10 volunteers from the Leeds Transport Historical Society (LTHS) have spent eight years refurbishing the tram that ran went out of service the same year that Queen Victoria died.

The tram, which was initially salvaged by the society in 1977 was used as a summer house at East End Park in Leeds, before it was billed as the highlight of the Middleton Railway’s bank holiday event this weekend.

The restoration began eight years ago and when its chassis and top deck needed fitting it was sent to Middleton last year.

Monday’s event had been organised by 
the Leeds Transport Historical Society, which raised thousands of pounds
for the tram’s eight-year restoration.

Project’s manager Jamie Guest, 60, from Gildersome, said: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the lady in hospital.'

The Leeds horse car 107 will now be displayed at the National Tramway Museum, in Crich, Derbyshire.
