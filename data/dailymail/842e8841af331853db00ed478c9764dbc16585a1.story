Some teams use cones during training sessions, others aim at simple targets, but when it comes to Bath Rugby, they opt for fans, vacuums and hand dryers.

The Aviva Premiership side welcomed their new sponsors Dyson on Thursday, and immediately put the appointment to good use.

The Bath squad took to the field and used their newly-acquired gizmos to test their ball precision, as centre Gavin Henson says they 'never stop looking for new ways of doing things'.

'We're constantly trying to improve what we do,' adds Henson.

'So
 the engineers at Dyson have come up with a few inventive challenges to 
make that training just that little bit more demanding.'

Bath fly-half George Ford adds: 'It's an intense experience, it's all about little details.

'We spend hours on the training field, doing hundreds of passes, hundreds of kicks. I'll have kicked that ball about a 1000 times in training before the big day to make sure I can nail them on the day.'

Dyson will remain Bath's principle sponsor for the next two seasons, replacing Novia.

Inventor and owner, Sir James Dyson, was named the wealthiest man in the South West with a Â£3billion fortune to his name, and the Bath deal is the first partnership of its kind.

Sir James, a season ticket holder for Bath, said: 'It's not a sponsorship in a normal sense. We don't do name branding, we always talk about our engineering.

'That's exactly what we are doing with the shirts, we'd have a bit of fun talking about our technology.'
