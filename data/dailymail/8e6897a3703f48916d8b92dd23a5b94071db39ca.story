It may have been millions of years since our ancestors lived among the branches but it seems many of us still carry an unusual relic of our tree-dwelling days.

New research shows that one in 13 humans walk around on chimp-like feet that feature the same adaptation as our tree-climbing cousins.

Researchers from Boston University filmed the feet of 400 volunteers as they walked barefoot around the Boston Museum of Science.

Most humans have stiff arches to help them walk but study found up to one in eight of us share a flexible mid-foot with primates that help them climb trees

They found as many as eight per cent of people have mid-foot flexibility.

These people also had a higher than average BMI and flatter feet.

But the study authors are unsure whether feature has stayed with some humans over the generations or whether it is a modern phenomenon caused by shoes.

Early hominid footprints from 3.5million years ago have been shown to have the same flexibility. 

Primates flexible feet bends both at the ball and halfway to the heel which helps them hold onto branches

But it was believed that the so-called midtarsal break had disappeared as humans evolved and began walking on two legs.

Jeremy DeSilva and Simone Gill, writing in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, that most people had no idea their feet were any difference, even though it was obvious to the naked eye.

DeSilva told the New Scientist: 'I was, and continue to be, surprised by this.'

The study found that people with the midtarsal break had significantly flatter feet than average.

Primates, such as chimpanzees, have a 
more flexible mid-foot that is useful for climbing trees and bends both 
at the ball and half way to the heel.

Humans have a rigid mid-foot - between the ball and heel - that acts as a lever for walking.

Crompton
believes that the same flexibility can be shown in the feet of most 
people and is actually a useful trait that adds stability when humans 
change speed. 

But DeSilva told the New Scientist that he thinks it is a hindrance to walking efficiently.

He said: 'My guess is that we are getting more variation than ever before, perhaps because shoes have impacted foot anatomy.
