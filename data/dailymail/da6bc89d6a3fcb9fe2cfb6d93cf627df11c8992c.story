A forged police letter obtained by The Mail on Sunday casts new light on the BBC’s controversial decision to drop its documentary on Jimmy Savile.

It was handed to this newspaper last week by a woman who appeared on the ITV programme which exposed the entertainer as a predatory paedophile.

Identified only as Fiona, she said the letter backed her claims that Surrey Police had dropped its  investigation into the sex abuse allegations because of Savile's ill health and 'senility'.

Allegations: 'Fiona' during the ITV documentary on Jimmy Savile. She this week handed the Mail On Sunday a forged police letter casting new light on the BBC's decision to drop its documentary on the late presenter

Newsnight journalists were desperate 
to see the letter because its contents were apparently at odds with what
 they had been told – that officers were unable to proceed because of 
lack of evidence.

Producers
 believed the letter would provide the breakthrough they needed to 
revive their stalled investigation and get the ten-minute film aired.

However,
 Fiona never sent it to them, and the Newsnight team began to doubt 
whether it ever existed – and if everything they were being told was the
 truth.

The BBC has been 
heavily criticised for shelving the item on Savile, which was due to air
 just a few weeks before Christmas tributes to the late presenter.

On Friday, it agreed to establish  an independent inquiry into why the film was dropped.

However,
 last night Corporation sources indicated that their dealings with Fiona
 – who they said ‘appeared to be playing games with us’ – was a 
contributory factor.

The
 Mail on Sunday has seen the letter – and the BBC’s fears appear to be 
justified because it is unquestionably a fake. The note says that Fiona 
was interviewed by police in 2006 despite the inquiry not beginning 
until May the following year.

The
 letter is also headed by a Surrey Police crest not in use at the time 
it was supposedly written. Significantly, there are no reference numbers
 included within the text.

A
 spokesman for Surrey Police said: ‘This letter is not genuine and was 
not sent by us at any time. The suggestion that we advised anyone this 
case would not be pursued due to the health of the individual concerned 
is wholly inaccurate.

‘An
 investigation file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service who 
advised there was not enough evidence to charge. All those involved were
 updated accordingly.’

For her part, Fiona denies forging the letter. Although she initially insisted that it was genuine, last night she conceded that she may have been the victim of a hoax.

An ITV spokesman declined to comment on the letter last night. A source said the programme’s production team was aware of the letter’s existence, but had not seen it.

The insider added that the ITV documentary – Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile – centred on the experiences of girls at the hands of Savile, rather than the police investigation.

Fiona was first contacted by a Newsnight reporter on November 3 last year. She was told the BBC wanted to ‘verify a few details about what happened there in the Seventies... in relation to Jimmy Savile’s visits to the home’.

Fiona claims she spoke with reporters about the allegations of abuse surrounding the presenter and told them about the letter she claimed was sent by Surrey Police officer Angela Sullivan in 2007.

The Newsnight team contacted her on November 11 and 22, and again on December 12 asking to see the letter. Fiona claims that she did not respond to the requests because she no longer wanted to be a part of the documentary.

She added: ‘In one of the emails I received from the Newsnight team they said it wasn’t just me, that others had also said it, so I always assumed others had been given a letter like mine.

‘The Newsnight reporters told me that they had hit a brick wall with the investigation and they needed to see the letter I had received from the police. 

‘I assumed other people had received [the letter] giving the same reasons. I had spoken to other people who had been told the same things as to why the investigation wasn’t going ahead. 

‘One of the reporters wanted me to send it to her so I scanned it on the computer and tried to send it in an email. When they didn’t receive it I assumed I had done something wrong but I didn’t resend it.’ 

In a final email, a Newsnight reporter wrote: ‘We’ve come up against a brick wall in our story – the CPS tell us the reason they dropped the inquiry is they didn’t have enough evidence. That contradicts what you and others have told us. We can only get round this by seeing the letter. Any chance?’

Fiona said last night: ‘I now understand the significance of not sending them the letter and I am possibly responsible for them not being able to run the story.

‘When they asked for it again I decided this had turned into an argument between who was right, the girls or the CPS. It shouldn’t be about what the CPS were saying, it should have been about the girls.’
