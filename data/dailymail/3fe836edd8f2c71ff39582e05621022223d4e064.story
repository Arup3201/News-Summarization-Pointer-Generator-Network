Are you one of those people who can't leave a pimple alone - even though you know your skin will look red and sore afterwards?

Now, one doctor has revealed the best way to attack blemishes - and claims this method won't hurt. 

Appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show, Dr Mehmet Oz said up to one in five of us are obsessed with picking blemishes, but most of us go about it completely the wrong way. 

'Never squeeze a pimple because you will macerate it,' he said.

'Never squeeze a pimple because you will macerate it,' said Dr Oz. He added the technique many of us adopt - pressing the healthy skin around the spot - actually damages it. Instead, use a needle cleaned with alcohol

'What's important is to not jab the needle in', he says. Instead, place the needle parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin across 

He went on to explain that the technique many of us adopt - pressing the healthy skin around the spot - actually damages it.

'You're destroying all the healthy tissue with the pressure you are putting on there by squeezing.' 

Using a revolting-looking giant blemish as a prop, he continued: 'The pimple is the body trying to push way the pus.'

Rather than prodding away at the skin with dirty fingers, he advised using a needle that has been cleaned with alcohol. 

'What's important is to not jab it in', he says - referring to the technique many of us use. 

Instead, place the needle parallel to the skin - rather like you would skewer something - and pierce the skin from one side to another.

'Then, rip UP,' he declared. 

'You only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead,' he said.

Here, there is no sensation, but if you jab the needle in front ways, you will soon hit a part of the spot that isn't dead - and that will hurt.  

The parallel technique also won't cause any damage to the surrounding, healthy skin, he added.

'Then, rip UP,' he declares. 'You only want to hit the white part of the pimple - because that bit is already dead'

Ripping up means you're attacking a bit where there is no sensation. But if you jab the needle in front ways, you will soon hit a part of the spot that isn't dead - and that will hurt. The parallel technique also won't cause any damage to the surrounding, healthy skin, he adds.

Last year, scientists discovered why some people are more prone to spots than others.

The researchers, from UCLA, said the key was finding out more about the bacteria that live on the skin and cause acne.

This bacteria contains ‘bad’ strains which cause pimples and ‘good’ ones that may protect the skin.

Having too much 'bad' bacteria is what causes spots, they say.

This is rather like an imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut causing digestive issues.

It is not yet clear why some people have more of either type of bacteria, or what comes first - the acne or the bacteria.

Other factors, such as an individual's genetic make-up or the sensitivity of their immune system, may also dictate whether good or bad strains grow on skin.

Instead, use a needle cleaned with alcohol and attack the spot sideways

Then, rip outwards to draw the pus out - and not damage any healthy skin
