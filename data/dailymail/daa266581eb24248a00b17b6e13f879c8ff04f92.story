Free school meals are to be extended to all infant pupils in England at a cost of £600million a year.

Nick Clegg will announce today that from next September an extra 1.5million children will qualify for the meals, regardless of their parents’ income.

The Deputy Prime Minister will tell the Lib Dem conference that the policy – which will save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child – was his price for agreeing to Tory plans for a tax break for married couples, worth about £150 a year.

Last night there were concerns over the cost of the scheme, while critics swiftly branded it a ‘gimmick’.

Treasury
 sources said it would be funded through spending cuts elsewhere, but 
critics questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all 
young children, while taking the axe to other universal payments such as
 child benefit for the better-off.

One senior Tory said it was ‘an 
appalling waste of £600million of taxpayers’ money’ and a ‘deal done on 
the back of a fag packet’.

Mr
 Clegg’s announcement at 5pm came only two hours after Treasury Chief 
Secretary Danny Alexander had told the conference: ‘There’s no spending 
bonanza around the corner.’

Currently,
 free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families. 
Extending them to all reception, year one and year two pupils is part of
 what the Lib Dems called a ‘straight up and down deal’ with the Tories 
that will mean them agreeing to a similar sum to be spent on a tax break
 for married couples.

Mr 
Clegg will tell delegates in Glasgow: ‘My ambition is that every primary
 school pupil should be able to sit down to a hot, healthy lunch.

‘Over
 the course of a year, families spend over £400 on lunch money for each 
child. I am determined to do all we can to help put money back in the 
pockets of these families.

'The Conservatives . . . have made it clear 
that their priority is to help some families over others, with a tax 
break for married couples. A tax break for some, funded through the 
taxes of others.

‘That tells
 you everything you need to know about their values. We, however, will 
help all families in these tough times, not just the kind we like best.’

But
 Tory sources dismissed the idea of a ‘deal’ over marriage tax breaks, 
pointing out that the Coalition Agreement struck in 2010 committed the 
Lib Dems to abstaining on that issue.

Restaurateur John Vincent proposed free school meals in a review for the Government earlier this year. Mr Vincent, co-founder of the Leon chain, said: ‘I am in Ethiopia right now, and frankly I cried when I heard. This is ground-breaking stuff.’

But 
former Labour welfare minister Frank Field said the money could be 
better spent on support for disadvantaged children before they reached 
school age.

‘If one was looking for ways to ensure every child fulfils 
his potential, this would fall early in the debate,’ he said of the 
meals policy. ‘This has more than a little of the smell of 1950s 
political gravy about it.’

In
 pilot areas where free school meals have been extended to all, 
including County Durham and parts of London, students were found to be 
on average two months ahead of peers elsewhere.

Ryan
 Bourne, of the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, said: ‘There was 
me thinking we had huge public borrowing.

'The poorest children are 
already eligible for free school meals – the main beneficiaries of this 
new universal benefit will be middle and upper-income households, who 
really don’t need a public subsidy.’

Robert
 Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, blasted the move as a ‘conference 
gimmick’, while Mark Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, 
said: ‘This is an enormously bad use of public money.’

However,
 Save the Children’s director of UK poverty, William Higham, said: ‘This
 will have a huge impact on the lives of tens of thousands of children 
in England. For many children, a school meal will be the only decent hot
 meal they get.’

The National Union of Teachers said pupils of all ages should qualify, adding: ‘Children do not stop being hungry at seven.’
