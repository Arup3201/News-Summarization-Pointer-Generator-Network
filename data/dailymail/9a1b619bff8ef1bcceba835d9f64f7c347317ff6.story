Britain's deepest double-dip recession for more than 50 years is not quite as bad as previously feared, official figures have revealed.

The Office for National Statistics has revised its Gross Domestic Product figures upwards, showing a smaller contraction in the economy between April and June this year.

GDP fell 0.5 per cent in three months after a second estimate today, which is better than the initial 0.7 per cent drop that shocked the City last month.

The figures show the extra bank 
holiday for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee did not have as much of an effect on spending.

Poor: The economy shrank by 0.5% in quarter two this year, but it is still bad news for the Chancellor

But despite the upward revision, it still represents the biggest quarter-on-quarter fall for more than three years and means the economy remains mired in the longest double-dip recession since the 1950s.

Smaller than previously thought falls in the production and 
construction sectors drove the figure higher, while the powerhouse 
services sector was unrevised, with a 0.1% fall.

Figures released today showed the UK's trade deficit increased to 
£7.3 billion, up from £3.7 billion in the previous quarter as the 
eurozone debt crisis hit exports - its biggest fall since the third 
quarter of 2010, which wiped 1% off the GDP figure.

Business investment also fell for the first time for more than a year.

Pressure: George Osborne's management of the economy is still be questioned after the revision

The economy is now 0.1 per cent 
smaller than when the Coalition came to power in 2010, with national 
output still 4.3 per cent below the pre-crisis peak of 2008.

After the Great Depression, by this stage the economy had already surpassed the pre-crash percentage.

Analysts 
have branded the figures a ‘disaster’ and warned that the economy 
will grow this year by far less than the 0.8 per cent expected by the 
Treasury – if at all.

The improved GDP figures will not to ease the pressure on Chancellor George Osborne who came under fresh fire to boost the economy last week when figures showed a shock increase in public sector borrowing in July.

A spokesman for the Treasury said: 'Britain is dealing with some very deep-rooted problems at home and a very serious debt crisis abroad, and that is why the healing of the economy is proving to be a slow and difficult process.

'Compared to two years ago, the deficit is down, inflation is down, and there are more private sector jobs.'The Government will continue to give its undivided attention to the economy - for example with recent announcements on infrastructure and lending.'

The fall in production was revised up from minus 1.3% to minus 0.9%, while the ONS said construction fell 3.9% rather than 5.2% as previously estimated.

Economists believe the extra bank holiday may have knocked as much as 0.5% off GDP, but the ONS said it was too early to measure the effect.

The services sector was not revised higher despite a better than previously thought 0.8% uplift in retail sales in June.

In another grim sign for the high street, household spending decreased 0.4% in the second quarter, despite falling inflation easing the pressure on consumers.

There are fears that the economy will struggle to pull out of its double-dip recession in the current quarter as the eurozone debt crisis slows global growth.

Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: 'UK GDP was revised up in Q2 as expected, but the revision is very small in the big picture and means that output is still more than 4% below its pre-recession peak.

'Of course, the GDP figures may in the future be revised up further.

'Nonetheless, given the drags from the fiscal squeeze, eurozone crisis and high domestic debt levels, we still doubt that a strong recovery lies ahead.'
