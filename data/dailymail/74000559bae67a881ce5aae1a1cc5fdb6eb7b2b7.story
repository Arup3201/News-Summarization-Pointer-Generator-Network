It’s almost ten years since terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Center twin towers and killed more than 2,500 people.

But many artefacts such as mobile phones, aeroplane engines and even a New York police car door survive to tell the tale of 9/11 at the Newseum in Washington D.C.

The museum is expanding its war on terror exhibition with more artefacts from 9/11 and other terrorist attacks that have never previously been seen on public display.

Memorials: Mobile phones and other communication devices found in the rubble from the September 11 attacks in 2011 on the World Trade Center are displayed as part of a new exhibit in Washington D.C.

‘I think the most powerful pieces here are the most personal,’ the Newseum’s Cathy Trost told CNN.

‘The things that people put in their pockets that morning not knowing that this was going to be a day that changed their lives forever.’

The Newseum, which charges admission fees of $22 for adults, is a 250,000 sq ft museum covering five centuries of news and features a 74ft marble engraving of the First Amendment.

Its new exhibition, the ‘War on Terror: The FBI's New Focus’, will open on Friday after the museum chose 60 pieces of evidence the FBI had in storage for terror trials, reported CNN.

This includes large pieces of an aeroplane that were not destroyed when it crashed into the World Trade Center in 2001.

A battered but intact wallet belonging to Ruth McCourt, of Connecticut, is on show.

She was with her four-year-old daughter, Juliana, visiting Disneyland, on board the second plane that hit the World Trade Centre, reported CNN.

A picture of the mother and daughter on the beach can also be seen.

‘A lot of family members want to make sure there are public displays because they don't want people to forget what they lost that day,’ Newseum senior vice president Susan Bennett told CNN.

Remembered: The Newseum worked closely with FBI agents, as well as 9/11 journalists and experts, to put together a picture of the events of the day itself and the following investigation

The mobile phones are particularly poignant because rescue workers could hear them ringing as desperate relatives and friends called in the hope that people on the other end might still be alive.

The Newseum worked closely with FBI agents, as well as 9/11 journalists and experts, to put together a picture of the events of the day itself and the following investigation.

‘There's a theme in the stories of how the FBI's changed,’ an FBI spokesman told CNN. ‘We're more of a national security organisation, threat-based intelligence. And we want to prevent.’
