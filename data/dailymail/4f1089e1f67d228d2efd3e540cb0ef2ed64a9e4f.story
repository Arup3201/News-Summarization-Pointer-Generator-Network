Stand-in boss: Aman Dalvi was paid £2,500-a-day - before receiving another colossal payout when his post was axed just six weeks later

A stand-in council boss was paid £2,500-a-day - before receiving another colossal payout when his post was axed just six weeks later.

Aman Dalvi was drafted in as temporary
 chief executive of Tower Hamlets Borough Council in east London last year as councillors debated whether to scrap the role.

He earned a staggering £115,000 for only 46 days in charge of the authority.

Mr Dalvi then sued the council when he realised it had decided to axe the post in a bid to trim its £1.2billion annual budget.

The authority - which must find £100million in savings over the next three years - paid him another huge sum to avoid an employment tribunal - taking his total payout to a staggering £256,000.

Local government minister Brandon Lewis has branded the council's decision an 'outrageous waste of taxpayers' money'.

'The fact that the chief executive of Tower Hamlets can be paid more in two weeks than the average household in the borough earns in a year is astounding,' he said.

'Paying a council official the same rate as a Premiership footballer is an outrageous waste of taxpayers' money.'

The average household income in the borough is less than £30,000, according to a council report.

Mr Dalvi,
 who was paid for both his role as interim chief executive and an 'out 
of court legal settlement', is believed to have sued the council after 
failing to land a permanent job as council boss.

The former chief executive Kevan Collins left the position in July 2011.

A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Borough Council said: 'The council has complied with its statutory requirements in the preparation and publication of the annual accounts.'

Mr Dalvi, who now earns £119-a-year as the corporate director for development and renewal at the council, was unavailable for comment.
