Aston Villa  midfielder Joe Cole has returned to training and could be fit for the club’s first home game of the season on Saturday 23 August.

Cole, 32, has missed the majority of pre-season with a thigh injury picked up in a friendly against Mansfield but manager Paul Lambert has given assurances the former England international will not be out for long.

‘It is a pure minor thigh strain. He felt it over time so we just left it,’ said Lambert, whose side played out a goalless draw against Parma without the absent Cole on Saturday.

On the mend: Joe Cole wants to return for Aston Villa's opening home game of the season

The Blues: Despite winning silverware at Chelsea, Joe Cole has been criticised for not reaching his potential

‘I would be more worried if it was knees and ankles and things like that. Once he gets fit, we’ll have a right good player on our hands. He can play the game and is a terrific lad as well.’

Cole was hailed as among the best players of his generation when he made his debut for West Ham as a teenager.

But despite winning trophies with Chelsea and going to three World Cups with England, it has always been felt that he never reached his full potential, partly due to injury.

Lambert is looking at Villa’s home game against Newcastle on August 23 as his possible debut, with next weekend’s opener against Stoke City coming too soon.

Keep calm and carry on: Paul Lambert, with Roy Keane (L),  is not overly concerned by Joe Cole's current injury

The manager said: ‘Joe is back training now so we have a good bill of health. He has missed a little bit of pre-season but he’s back training with us which is good. I will see how he does in the week.’
