A doctor who worked at the hospital at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal drugged and gang-raped a seriously ill girl of 12, a court heard yesterday.

Michael Salmon assaulted the patient with two other men in a hospital bed as part of a string of attacks on young girls in the 70s and 80s.

One former patient came to Salmon when she became pregnant aged 16 – and was raped at his home moments after he gave her an illegal backstreet abortion, it was said.

Others were allegedly molested as their parents sat unaware on the other side of a hospital screen in his consulting room.

The 79-year-old appeared at Reading Crown Court yesterday where a judge heard how he abused his position as consultant paediatrician at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire – where disgraced DJ Savile is said to have abused scores of patients while carrying out charity work.

Patients claimed Salmon also had a picture of his son with the Jim’ll Fix It star on his office wall.

Jurors were told that although Salmon did not abuse victims ‘in concert’ with Savile, the sex attacks between 1973 and 1988 occurred at the same time as other offences.

Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC, said the children’s doctor thought he was ‘bomb-proof’ after abusing at least eight teenage girls aged 11 to 18 at Stoke Mandeville and other hospitals in Buckinghamshire.

She described how married Salmon took a naked photo of one patient, who was told to call him ‘Uncle Mike’. 

On another occasion the girl, who suffered from a genetic condition which causes tumours, was allegedly gang-raped when she was aged between 12 and 14.

After slipping something in her drink that left her ‘woozy’ one night, Salmon and two other men raped her in a hospital room before taking her by wheelchair back to the ward, the court heard.

Another 16-year-old seen by Salmon for digestive problems was allegedly assaulted during intimate medical examinations a number of times.

When she fell pregnant, Salmon is said to have lured her to his home where he carried out a painful abortion in his bedroom. 

Minutes later, he allegedly held her down on the bed and raped her, telling the teen ‘one favour deserves another’ as she wept and screamed in pain.

A fortnight later, Salmon tried to rape her again after claiming she needed a further procedure, jurors were told. 

Miss Moore said: ‘He abused his position to undertake these assaults and got his own way, one by telling his victims he is doing her a favour, he clearly thought he was bomb-proof.’

His career at the hospital came to an end when he was convicted of three indecent assaults in 1990 and struck off the medical register, jurors were told.

New alleged victims came forward after recent allegations emerged that Savile had abused children at Stoke Mandeville.

Some told how they were fondled in a consulting room while he pretended to listen to their heart or carried out intimate examinations when there was no need, said Miss Moore. 

Many were also forced to kiss and hug the ‘creepy’ doctor at the end of each appointment, she added. 

One victim suffering severe migraines remembers a photo on the wall of the doctor’s son appearing on Jim’ll Fix it with Savile.

‘He told her there was a special button between her legs which she could touch to stop the migraines,’ said Miss Moore.

Salmon also offered his patients the contraceptive pill and claimed he could check for breast cancer, it was said. 

When he was arrested, the retired doctor denied the offences, describing his victims as ‘gold diggers’, Miss Moore added.

Salmon, who lives with his wife in Salisbury, Wiltshire, denies three rapes, 11 counts of indecent assault and two counts of using an instrument to procure a miscarriage. 

The trial continues.
