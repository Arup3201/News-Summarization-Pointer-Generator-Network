The killing of an off-duty soldier in a brutal attack in broad daylight on a London street has shocked the nation, inspiring hundreds of strangers who had never met him to leave poignant tributes.

Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, of 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was hit by a car and then 'hacked to death' on Wednesday by two men who got out of the vehicle and attacked him with knives and meat cleavers while shouting 'Allah Akbar!' - an Islamic phrase for 'God is great'.

His death has sparked a public outpouring of grief, with hundreds of bunches of flowers, teddy bears, poems and heartfelt tributes to the father-of-one left near the scene of the crime by Woolwich Barracks, south east London.

In a speech after the attack, David Cameron said the action would unite Britain.

He said: 'The people who did this 
were trying to divide us. They should know: something like this will 
only bring us together and make us stronger.'

The Prime Minister was speaking after
 attending an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss what happened, after 
briefings from security services suggested it was a terrorist attack.

Both the suspected killers, Michael 
Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were known to MI5. They were 
shot by armed officers at the scene after allegedly waiting around for 
up to 20 minutes for police to arrive so they could attack them.

A man who was identified on internet 
forums as Adebolajo was filmed clutching knives and with his hands 
covered in blood ranting about Islam to passers-by with cameras after 
the incident.

The pair have been arrested and are under armed guard as they recover in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

the Royal Borough Greenwich, Angela Cornforth and council leader, Chris 
Roberts said: 'Now that the death of Drummer Lee Rigby has been

'Woolwich is a
 place born out of the Army and it runs through the DNA of the town and 
many of its people. This is a place which has witnessed attacks on our 
armed service personnel before, not least the terrorist attack by the 
IRA almost 40 years ago.

'Then,
 as now, the people and communities of Woolwich have shown their pride 
in our Armed Services and respect for the role they play and the risks 
they undertake.

'Every single soldier and their family can be assured of our enduring support in the days, weeks, months and years ahead.'

Another man and a woman, both 29, 
were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, after police raided a
 number of addresses around London, Essex and Lincolnshire.

Since
 the attack on Drummer Rigby there have been a number of suspected 
'revenge' attacks on mosques around the country and two men have been 
arrested in separate incidents in Gillingham, Kent, and Braintree, 
Essex.

In his speech, Mr Cameron made clear that the suspected killers did not represent Islam.

He said: 'This country will be 
absolutely resolute in its stand against violent extremism and terror. 
We will never give in to terror – or terrorism – in any of its forms. 
This view is shared by every community in our country.

'This
 was not just an attack on Britain – and on the British way of life. It 
was also a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim communities who give so 
much to our country. There is nothing in Islam that justifies this truly
 dreadful act.

'We will 
defeat violent extremism by standing together, by backing our police and
 security services and above all by challenging the poisonous narrative 
of extremism on which this violence feeds.'
