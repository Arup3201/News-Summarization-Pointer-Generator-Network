For newly-promoted clubs the start of the Barclays Premier League season brings with it a mixture of excitement and nerves.

After a year of winning regularly, the celebrations at the end of the campaign and optimism over the summer, they will generally face a very different prospect over the proceeding eight months.

Here, Sportsmail gives you a run-down on the three sides promoted from the Championship and how they could fare.

Going up: Leicester City players throw manager Nigel Pearson into the air after confirming promotion

BURNLEY

Surprised everyone outside of Burnley, and most people in the town too, when they secured the second automatic promotion slot. Manager Sean Dyke described it as ‘historic’ after they finished eight points above third-placed Derby with a threadbare squad.

PLAYERS IN:

Michael Kightly, from Stoke, £1million

Matthew Gilks, from Blackpool, free

Matthew Taylor, from West Ham, free

Marvin Sordell, from Bolton, £500,000

Steven Reid, from West Brom, free

Lucas Jutkiewicz, from Middlesbrough, £1.5million

PLAYERS OUT:

Junior Stanislas, to Bournemouth, free

Chris Baird, to West Brom, free

NET SPEND: £3m

New boys: Matt Taylor (left) and Steven Reid (right) are two of six summer signings at Burnley

ONE PLAYER THEY NEED: They desperately require a centre-back. Their pairing of Jason Shackell and Michael Duff were solid last year but noway near Premier League quality. Anyone with some top flight experience will help their cause.

KEY MAN: Danny Ings – The hit-man netted 26 times in 45 games last season and remains with Burnley despite interest from other top-flight clubs.

FINISHING POSITION: 20

WORD ON THE TERRACES: Sean Dyche worked miracles to get them promoted, spending money on just one player from when he joined the club in 2012 to helping them finish second. It is going to take something even more special to keep them up on a comparatively minuscule budget again.

ONE REASON TO BE CHEERFUL: The squad – with only 22 first-team players last season – has been bulked up with six new signings. Making Kightly’s move permanent is a great piece of business and he could be a real attacking outlet for them this season.

ONE REASON TO BE FEARFUL: Do the rest of the signings have the quality to keep them up? Marvin Sordell has failed to make an impact in the top flight in the past and the the likes of Matthew Taylor and Steven Reid are merely unwanted by other clubs.

Big ask: Sean Dyche will do well to keep Burnley in the Premier League after guiding them to promotion

LEICESTER CITY

Ended their 10-year absence from the top flight by running away with the Championship title. They were promoted by the beginning of April with a club record 102 points and 31 victories, nine points clear of second-place Burnley. Easy.

PLAYERS IN:

Jack Barmby, from Manchester United, free

Matthew Upson, from Brighton, free

Louis Rowley, from Manchester United, free

Leonardo Ulloa, from Brighton, £8million

PLAYERS OUT:

Zak Whitbread, to Derby, free

Neil Danns, to Bolton, free

Benedict Frempah, to Ross County, free

NET SPEND: £8million

Pressure: Leonardo Ulloa (centre) will be expected to score goals after arriving from Brighton for £8million

ONE PLAYER THEY NEED: Another quality striker is essential. The club are interested in Troy Deeney, but Watford are holding out for a sum similar to the one paid for Ulloa.

KEY MAN: Kasper Schmeichel – Has the potential to be one of the best goalkeepers in the league next season and could be crucial to keeping out the opposition while sustaining heavy pressure.

PREDICTED FINISHING POSITION: 17

WORD ON THE TERRACES: After securing the services manager Nigel Pearson and sensational stopper Schmeichel on new deals, fans are optimistic about survival. However, significant transfer funds have been splashed out on a striker with no Premier League experience and they will be relying on him to start firing quickly.

ONE REASON TO BE CHEERFUL: The way they stormed to the Championship title should give the players huge confidence going into the Premier League campaign. They must maintain that momentum if they want any chance of staying in the league.

ONE REASON TO BE FEARFUL: If they fail to stay up, top-flight clubs will be all over their best players and the likes of Schmeichel and Andy King could move elsewhere, making it even harder to get back up again. 

Safe hands: Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel has the ability to play a crucial role in Leicester's survival bid

QPR

They did it the hard way. Harry Redknapp’s side, full of players with Premier League experience, were expected to run away with the league, but they finished fourth and eventually won promotion via the play-offs.

PLAYERS IN:

Rio Ferdinand, from Manchester United, free

Steven Caulker, from Cardiff, £8million

Jordon Mutch, from Cardiff, £6million 

PLAYERS OUT:

Tom Hitchcock, to MK Dons, free

Aaron Hughes, to Brighton, free

Esteban Granero, to Real Sociedad, £2.1million

NET SPEND: £11.9million

Defensive duo:  Rio Ferdinand (left) and Steven Caulker (right) have both been brought to Loftus Road

ONE PLAYER THEY NEED: A striker to partner the prolific Charlie Austin who can score goals in the top flight but is not prone to injury. If Redknapp can convince Loic Remy to stay and integrate him back into the side, he could well be the answer to their problems.

KEY MAN: Charlie Austin – Scored 20 goals in 37 appearances last year despite struggling midway through the season with injury. His raw instinct as a striker means he has been crying out for a chance in the Premier League and could well surprise many teams.

FINISHING POSITION: 14

WORD ON THE TERRACES: Ferdinand and Caulker are superb acquisitions to create a formidable partnership at the centre of their defence. Fans are wary of their relegation in 2012, when they were not expected to go down but crashed out of the league, but more quality recruitments will settle their nerves.

ONE REASON TO BE CHEERFUL: They have a manager with huge top-flight experience and the foundations of a Premier League team are already in place. Provided Redknapp can get the balance right, and bring in a few more faces, they should comfortably stay in the league.

ONE REASON TO BE FEARFUL: They were never supposed to get relegated in the first place. Although Redknapp was not in charge for the whole season he still didn’t manage to keep them up and they were one of the surprise departures the season before last.
