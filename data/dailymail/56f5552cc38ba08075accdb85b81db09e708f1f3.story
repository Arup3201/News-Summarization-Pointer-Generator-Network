He may have be linked to Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, but Freddie Fox has suggested that he could be bisexual.

The actor, who reportedly enjoyed two dates with Cressida in the space of a week, opened up about his love life in an interview with The Telegraph.

The 26-year-old Cucumber star said: 'I’ve had girlfriends, but I wouldn’t wish to say "I am this or I am that", because at some time in my life I might fall in love with a man.

British actor Freddie Fox was recently linked to Prince Harry's ex, Cressida Bonas, but has now suggested that he could be bisexual and says the 'appreciation of both sexes is nothing new'

'I hope that I am the type of person who would fall in love with another person, as opposed to a sex. Most of my life to date has been as a straight man, but who knows what will happen next?'

Freddie, the son Edward Fox, star of classic 1973 film The Day Of The Jackal and actress Joanna David, spoke openly about sexuality and the misconceptions often associated with it.

He continued: 'Appreciation of both sexes is actually not new; it’s incredibly old, it’s Roman, it’s Greek, and it is something people can do throughout an entire lifetime, having hugely meaningful relationships, no matter what sex they are.'

Freddie, the brother of Silent Witness actress Emilia Fox, and Cressida were romantically linked after making their first public appearance together at a West End screening of Tim Burton’s movie Big Eyes earlier this month.

A few days later, they were spotted at celebrity hotspot Chateat Marmont in Los Angeles. 

Cressida Bonas and Freddie Fox attend a BAFTA Special Screening of Big Eyes hosted by Harvey Weinstein in early January, where a guest revealed the pair were 'very close and affectionate'

‘Freddie and Cressida were very close and affectionate,’ a guest at the London screening told The Mail on Sunday at the time.

‘They spent half an hour deep in conversation in a corner by the bar. When the film started, they had to sit separately because there weren’t any seats together and they both looked very disappointed.’

The event also proved a valuable networking opportunity for 25-year-old Cressida, who was introduced by Freddie to veteran actor Charles Dance.

She got on so well with the White Mischief star that when the film finished, Dance, 68, was seen embracing her warmly.

Later in the week, Freddie and Cressida jetted off to the United States, and enjoyed an evening at Chateau Marmont in Hollywood. 

Miss Bonas, who dated Prince Harry for two years until last spring, is getting set to star alongside model Cara Delevingne as well as Oscar-winners Dame Judi Dench and Christoph Waltz in Tulip Fever, but acclaimed film producer Harvey Weinstein has singled her out as one to watch.

He said: ‘Cressida is great and people will see what a fantastic actress she is. It will be the first of many roles for her.’

He praised her for not trying to use her fame to secure roles, saying: ‘She is not taking advantage of any media profile.’

However, friends of Miss Bonas have denied the pair are romantically linked.

Freddie, meanwhile, dated actress Tamzin Merchant for two years. The pair decided to call time on their relationship in September 2013 with a source telling the Mail On Sunday at the time: 'Sadly their relationship has fizzled out. Freddie is so focused on his acting and is considering a move to America.'

Freddie has had an illustrious acting career for someone so young and made headlines when he starred as the president of the Bullingdon Club - an Oxford University club notorious for loutish behaviour. He starred alongside his good friends Douglas Booth and Sam Claflin.
