Most sportsmen will try to put a positive spin on things, no matter how bad they get. Sometimes the truth is unpalatable.

For manager Manuel Pellegrini and his Manchester City players, however, the lessons of Tuesday night’s home defeat by Barcelona were clear. Once again they had come up short and they head to Spain for a second leg on March 18 knowing something much, much better is required.

So when City’s French defender Gael Clichy was asked the key question, there was no great point trying to sugar-coat anything.

Have City, Clichy was asked, improved at all since last year’s 2-0 defeat at home by Barca at this stage of the Champions League?

‘It’s hard to say that,’ said Clichy. ‘If you look at this game they had more possession, created chances and we ran after the ball a lot. I don’t know if we have improved since last year.

‘We are privileged to be in a club that wants to improve year after year. And to improve is to go further in the Champions League. Twice in a row we have played Barcelona. They are a big team and know how to play those kind of games. Eventually we will get there.

‘Those clubs have been built for several years — 20, 30, 40 years — and this is only the sixth season for us but that’s no excuse. The owner wants to improve quickly, so we have to improve quickly.

‘If we play as we did in the second half, everything is possible. It’s not going to be easy, but we are going to try really hard.’

Given that Clichy had been sent off only an hour earlier, the former Arsenal player’s honesty was welcome. City did improve after half-time but by then they were 2-0 down and all but out of the competition once again.

Goalkeeper Joe Hart, whose last-minute penalty save from Lionel Messi prevented another Barcelona goal, admitted City had panicked when their plan to suffocate Barca high up the field failed.

City’s owners — and Pellegrini — face a conundrum in that while few really thought they would beat Barcelona, improvement is expected. And currently it is hard for Pellegrini to suggest there has been any.

City bought three players last summer. Bacary Sagna has not managed to displace Pablo Zabaleta at full back, Fernando would perhaps not have played on Tuesday had Yaya Toure not been suspended, and £30million-plus French defender Eliaquim Mangala has been the biggest disappointment of all.

Football director Txiki Begiristain heads City’s recruitment team and must accept some responsibility. Pellegrini, however, will ultimately feel the greatest pressure. There is no question mark over his future right now but this is a club with a very clear idea of where it wants to get to and when.

Some may question Pellegrini’s decision to play 4-4-2 on Tuesday. City looked short in central midfield where Fernando and James Milner had a dreadful evening. More startling was the way City seemed to have learned so little from last year.

As Barcelona picked them apart in the first half, it was with the same tactics we witnessed a year ago. Pellegrini will thank no-one for saying it, but it’s hard to imagine a team coached by Jose Mourinho being dismantled like this.

‘I have played Barcelona many times and even if you played five in the middle you always feel a player short because they know how to move, how to keep the ball,’ added Clichy.

‘The choice of the manager to go from the first minute with two strikers showed we wanted to play offensively and score goals. We didn’t, and we didn’t start well.

‘We have to carry on like this because that is the way we want to play and that is the way we are going to win things.’

City must now forget Barcelona. The return leg is three weeks away and on Sunday they travel to Merseyside for a Barclays Premier League meeting with Liverpool.

Last season Liverpool won this fixture 3-2 but they are in Europe tonight and City’s two days of extra rest may give them the edge.

The Premier League is safe and familiar territory for City. They understand it. Sooner or later, however, Pellegrini must find a way to expand his team’s horizons.

Manchester City’s match statistics were similar in some respects to those from last season’s performance against Barcelona. 

They had one more shot on target on Tuesday (4) than in last season’s match at the Etihad and the same number of shots off target (4).

Their possession was up on last season, though still low — 37.9 per cent compared to 31.6 per cent in 2014.

However, they did get 20 crosses into the penalty area as opposed to 11 last season and had eight corners on Tuesday night against one in 2014.

PS Barcelona’s passing success rate was down on the same fixture last year — 88.9 per cent of 686 passes compared to 92.4 per cent in 2014. 

This was largely down to Luis Suarez, who scored two goals but found a team-mate with only 72.7 per cent of his passes. Without his erratic input, Barcelona’s average was 90.3 per cent.
