When she was born with two mouths, doctors told her parents she would not survive.

But 15-month-old Rokaya Mohamed has not only survived against all odds but just travelled from her home country of Egypt to America to receive ground-breaking surgery which they said would give her back her smile.

Before last Wednesday, doctors at Children's Hospital Los Angeles had never before performed the procedure as Rokaya's condition is believed to be the only one of its kind.

Unique case: 15-month-old Rokaya Mohamed was born with two mouths, both of which had fully formed upper and lower jaws

X-ray: Ryoka's father said his daughter's rare deformity was not picked up in ultra sounds or X-rays before she was born

When Dr William Magee III, medical director of international programmes in the department of plastic and reconstructive surgery, heard about the baby who was born with two mouths, both of which included an upper and lower jaw, he found a way to help.

Rokaya's father Tamer Mohamed, told ABC that they managed to keep her healthy by feeding her a liquid diet since she was born.

He said of her condition: 'The X-rays, the ultrasound didn't show us how her face is going to be. But we are going to fight to change her life.'

While Dr Magee and his team have performed facial cleft surgeries on more than 100 children from more than 50 countries, they had never performed this type of surgery before.

But they were confident they could transform the little girl's face and save her life.

He said: 'We spent a lot of time planning the surgery, but we made some final decisions on how to go about it while in the operating room.

'The face is made of multiple pieces, so it's like pieces of a puzzle. The cool thing is that we were able to use all those extra pieces in Rokaya's face.

'We're very well-experienced in terms of
bringing in children around the world for these surgeries. We thought we could do an excellent job and get her home safely. 
She's done quite well, better than we anticipated.'

Surgery: Rokaya is recovering in hospital and is expected to be able to fly home in a few weeks

Expert: Though doctors at Children's Hospital Los Angeles had never performed the surgery before, when they heard about the condition they wanted to help

Rokaya will need to undergo many more operations throughout her life but doctors in Egypt will be equipped to perform them.

The toddler is currently recovering in hospital and will be in the U.S. for several more weeks until she is well enough to fly home.

Non-profit organisations, including Mending Kids International, the Children of War and Operation Smile, an international medical charity committed to healing children's smiles, helped Rokaya's family pay to travel to the U.S. and receive the surgery.

Operation Smile was founded by Dr Magee's father, Dr William Magee Jr in 1982.
