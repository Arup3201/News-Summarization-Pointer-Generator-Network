In these days of airbrushing on an industrial scale, we're not used to seeing models' lumps and bumps.

But Cara Delevingne had no qualms about showing off her imperfections as she strutted down the catwalk at the Versace fashion show.

The British model of the moment sported some rather vicious-looking marks on her right shin and foot.

The thigh-high split in the red Versace gown revealed angry red blemishes on the legs of 20-year-old Cara Delevingne

Cara Delevingne had a number of angry red bruises as she strutted down the catwalk at Milan fashion week

Not that they seemed to faze the 
20-year-old, who looked a picture of confidence in a split-to-the-thigh 
red silk gown with precariously positioned spikes around the neck.

It is not known how she sustained the wounds but Miss Delevingne revealed at the weekend that she suffers from psoriasis.

Writing on social networking site Twitter, she said: 'Be gone psoriasis, you're no fun!'

The skin condition, which causes red scaly patches, can be made worse by stress, drinking and smoking, among other triggers.

Just days before the Versace show in 
Milan, she was pictured stumbling out of a London house party after 13 
hours on the town – certainly living up to photographer Mario Testino's 
recent declaration that she is the new Kate Moss.

Celebrations started at 4pm, after 
she appeared in the Burberry fashion show. By 6.30pm she was with friend
and fellow model Georgia May Jagger, daughter of Sir Mick, in an East 
London pub.

Afterwards, she went to a concert in West London where she bumped into One Direction star Harry Styles.

She then headed to a magazine party at
a hotel in Piccadilly and chatted with Kate Moss's husband Jamie Hince,
before ending up at a bash at the home of football agent Dave Gardner –
where she was pictured tripping down the stairs as she left at 5am.

At the MIlan show, she was modelling a 
floor-length red silk gown with a jewelled bodice accessorised with a 
spiked choker, red shoes and a single spike through her left ear.

Later at the fashion event she caused a stir with a fluorescent purple 'mohi wig', wearing a furry grey and purple coat with 
matching clutch bag.

Hair guru Sam McKnight was responsible for giving all the 
models a tight braid and topped the look off with colored fox fur 
mohawks- a far cry from Cara's usually super sleek blonde locks.

Today
the model was pictured enjoying some free time in between fashion shows
with friends in the streets of Italy's fashion capital.

Cara Delevingne was seen leaving a Notting Hill house at 5am after attending the Rihanna for River Island show in London Fashion Week

Wearing a preppy green and white jacket emblazoned with stars, she matched it 
with a stripey pair of leggings tucked into chunky leather boots.

Looking a far cry from her steely pout during the catwalks and promo shots, Cara looked ecstatic to be free for a few hours.

She ditched the glamorous and quirky garbs for a more casual ensemble as she relaxed with her pals.
