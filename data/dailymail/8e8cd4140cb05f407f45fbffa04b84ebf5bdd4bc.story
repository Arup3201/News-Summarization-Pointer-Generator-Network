The Queen has been forced to live in 'crumbling' surroundings, with a 60-year-old boiler struggling to heat Buckingham Palace, it was claimed today as it emerged the Royal Estate now requires £50million of repairs.

The monarch has seen utility bills soar by 50 per cent in just a year to hit £3.1million. Palace aides were today challenged about why they failed to ‘fix’ energy tariffs as families are urged to do.

It also emerged courtiers are planning to scrap the Royal Train when the current carriages are taken out of service within the next 10 years, complaining it is too noisy, uncomfortable and expensive.

Feeling the cold: The heating was turned up in the royal palaces last winter to spare the Queen., Prince Philip and other senior royals from the harsh cold weather

The £1million rise in utility bills was 
blamed on the cold winter, with the Queen and other senior royals using 
14 per cent more gas.

The Commons spending watchdog was grilling senior officials from Buckingham Palace about the use of public money.

It comes after it emerged the Queen is set to receive an inflation-busting 22 per cent ‘pay rise’ over two years.

She is now expected to be given £37.9 million in 2014-15 to run her Household and conduct official engagements, up from £31 million in 2012-13.

The Royal Train could be axed within a decade, it emerged today.

The idea of the monarch having their own dedicated train for long journeys around the UK dates back to 1842.

The current Queen's and Duke's saloons came into service in the late 1970s, but aides say they have become increasingly uncomfortable and noisy for the aging royals.

Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse, told MPs that the train would probably only survive another five or 10 years.

'There will come a time when it does not work properly any more but we are not there yet,' he said.

Pressed on the bill for a replacement, he suggested the cost would be too high to afford.

'It would be a major investment. I think the numbers would be staggering.'

Instead, senior royals could forced to travel more by car to cut costs, MPs were told.

However, the monarch is said to be 
‘down to her last £1 million’, leaving her vulnerable to ‘unexpected 
costs’, according to a report from the National Audit Office.

MPs
 on the Public Accounts Committee expressed alarm that the heating 
systems were so old that the Queen saw heating bills rocket to keep warm
 in the winter.

Labour MP Nick Smith said: ‘I was shocked that boilers hadn’t been changed in Buckingham Palace for 60 years.’

Austin Mitchell, another Labour MP, complained that the Queen was living in 'crumbling surroundings'.

Around 39 per cent of the Royal estate is below 'target condition', and bringing it back up to standard was likely to cost more than £50 million.

There are plans to replace the boiler in the next three to five years, at a cost of up to £1million.

In 2012-13 gas use soared by 14 per cent, electricity was up three per cent and waste water increased by nine per cent.

Last year the Royal Estate used approximately 24.4 million kWh of gas, up from 21.0 million kWh in 2011-12.

The Palace said it was due 'largely to the prolonged period of cold weather in the 
final quarter of 2012-13'.

Lib Dem MP Ian Swales said: ‘Gas is up 14 per cent. That’s an enormous increase in gas consumption in just one year.’

MPs said the rise did not match rhetoric from aides that there had been a renewed emphasis on going green.

Mike Stevens, Deputy Treasurer to Her Majesty The Queen, said: ‘We certainly saw a very significant increase in the final quarter of last year.

‘But this is an area that we will wish to look at ways in which we can reduce.

‘One of the areas in which the Sovereign Grant will be applied will be the replacement of boilers in the man palaces which are nearing the end of their useful life.

‘One of the key projects of the next 15 years will be refurbishment of Buckingham Palace.

‘Heating systems there are antiquated. They are over 60 years old and they don’t lend themselves to efficient use of energy.’

Refurbishment: Many of the grand rooms used to meet foreign signatories, such as the King Tupou VI of Tonga and Queen Nanasipau'u who met the Queen last week, are in need or urgent repair

The Royal Household was accused 
by the Public Accounts Committee of giving some of its top earners a 'heck of an increase' while many staff had their pay frozen last year.

Committee chairman 
Margaret Hodge said: 'Was it really sensible for three out of 
the five members of the Lord Chamberlain's committee, all earning over £100,000, to give themselves extra money when they were expecting 
staff on £21,000 not to have extra money.'

She said it was 'not a very good message' to freeze wages for low earners while increasing pay for managers.

Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse, stressed that his pay of £180,000 was frozen during the last 
financial year, as was the salary of the Queen's private secretary Sir 
Christopher Geidt, who warns £146,000 a year.
    
Mike Stevens, the Queen's deputy treasurer, told the MPs: 'Underpinning these increases, over the five years since 
2007-08, the household's pay bill has reduced by 6% in real terms.'

It is hoped a major overhaul in future will help to ‘drive energy consumption down’.

The NAO highlighted what it describes as ‘significant reductions’ in the monarchy’s funding over the last 20 years.

It
 says that grants for royal travel on official engagements both at home 
and abroad has been slashed by 76 per cent in real terms.

The maintenance for royal palaces, including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, was similarly reduced by an impressive 60 per cent.

That has left, according to the NAO, a huge backlog in property maintenance, with 39 per cent of occupied royal palace being deemed below their ‘target condition’.

Mr Stevens added: ‘Like all projects we are having to prioritise and try to eek out the useful life of assets wherever possible.

‘I would expect that we would to looking to replace [Buckingham Palace boilers] within the next three to five years.’

Pressed on the cost of the new boiler, he said it would be in the ‘ballpark of half a million to £1million, in that sort of region’.

Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse,  also defended the way the Royals sourced energy, explaining that while the Household did not 'fix' its bill, it set up multi-year deals to obtain power from the wholesale markets.

The Queen’s money men have been dramatically scaling back their spending, reducing net expenditure by 55 per cent in real terms.

According to the figures, that led to real-term expenditure of £32.9 million in 2011-2012, compared to £72.6million in 1991-92.

In order to help meet the shortfall, the Queen has repeatedly eaten into her savings - known as ‘drawing down on reserves’ - over the years and is, apparently, down to her last £1 million in the bank.

The NAO, which scrutinises public spending for Parliament and is independent of government, says this poses serious questions about the palace’s ability to cope in an unexpected crisis if, say, the roof of Buckingham Palace fell down.

‘As part of its long-term planning the Household may need to consider whether the Reserve is adequate to meet unexpected costs,’ it says.
