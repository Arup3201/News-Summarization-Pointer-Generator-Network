Solar flares can cause widespread disruption on Earth, but scientists have struggled to understand how they are formed.

Now, a team from from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have taken a huge step forward by recreated the phenomenon that leads to solar flares in a lab.

They hope their work could lead to improved space weather forecasts.

The US team amanged to recreate plasma loops (above) in a lab for the first time. The loops are precursors to the massive solar flares on the surface of the sun can cause electrical storms on earth.

'We're studying how these solar loops work, which contributes to the knowledge of space weather,' says Paul Bellan, professor of applied physics at Caltech, who compares the research to studying hurricanes.

'For example, you can't predict a hurricane unless you know more about the events that precede it, like high-pressure and low-pressure fronts.

'The same is true for solar flares.'

The team hope their work could lead to improved warnings of solar storms.

'It takes some time for the plasma to get to Earth from the sun, so it's possible that with more research, we could have up to a two-day warning period for massive solar flares,' said Professor Bellan.

The laboratory plasma loop studies were conducted by graduate student Eve Stenson together with Bellan and are reported in the August 13 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters.

A strong M3.2 solar flare captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). NASA's Space Weather Services estimated that it traveled at over 630 miles per second, causing geomagnetic storms on earth

Inside a vacuum chamber, electromagnets create an arched magnetic field.

Then, hydrogen and nitrogen gas is released at the two footpoints of the arch.

Finally,
 a high-voltage electrical current is applied at the footpoints to 
ionize the gas and turn it into plasma, which travels at a minimum speed
 of about six miles per second.

They found that two magnetic forces 
control the behavior of arching loops of plasma, which is hot, ionized 
gas.

'One force expands the arch radius and so lengthens the loop while 
the other continuously injects plasma from both ends into the loop,' 
Bellan said.

'This latter force injects just the right amount of 
plasma to keep the density in the loop constant as it lengthens.'

The duo says that in simpler terms, this process is like squeezing toothpaste into a tube from both ends, except that the toothpaste has little magnets in it, so there are magnetic forces acting internally.

Stenson and Bellan studied plasma loops that they generated with a pulse-powered, magnetized plasma gun.

'All three steps—the magnetic field, and the gas, and the high voltage—happen in just a flash of light inside the chamber," says Stenson.

'We use high-speed cameras with optical filters to capture the behavior of the plasmas."By color-coding the inflowing plasma, the optical filters vividly demonstrated the flow from the two ends of the loop.

According to Bellan, no one has ever used this technique before.

On camera, red plasma flows into the loop from one footpoint while blue plasma simultaneously flows into the loop from the other end.

'For each experiment, you'll only see the light from the hydrogen side or the nitrogen side in the images," explains Stenson.

'But these experiments are very reproducible, so we can put separate images on top of each other to see both plasmas in one picture.'

Next, Bellan's lab will test how two loops interact with each other.

'We want to see if they can merge and form one big loop,' says Bellan.

'Some people believe that this is how larger plasma loops on the sun are formed.'
