Spain has pledged a repeat of its disgraceful block of Gibraltar and insisted it will continue to stop-check vehicles despite William Hague's intervention.

The Foreign Secretary phoned his Spanish counterpart after Civil Guards caused eight-hour traffic jams by stopping every car and motorbike trying to leave the British territory.

But his call for a speedy resolution to the border problems fell on deaf ears as Madrid bragged it would continue with its controversial policy.

Spanish Foreign Secretary Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo allowed diplomats to brief journalists they would continue to carry out 'exhaustive checks' whenever they deemed it necessary.

Slapping Hague down less than 24 hours after their phone call, he claimed Spain was obliged to uphold the law.

One Spanish Foreign Office official, sticking to the country's familiar strategy of making the Rock out to be a criminal haven, said: 'Spain has the obligation to make sure EU laws on the movement of people and tax are upheld to try to prevent things like tax evasion and to fight against smuggling.'

The comments signalled Spain's determination to bolster their bid to make life uncomfortable for local Gibraltarians and the hundreds of British day-trippers who cross the border every day, even if their own people are caught up in the chaos.

Civil Guards stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving Gibraltar for Spain last Friday after Spanish fishermen sparked a standoff with the Royal Navy as they tried to disrupt the creation of an artificial reef in the Bay of Gibraltar.

They caused one of the worst traffic jams in the Rock's history. Officers from the Royal Gibraltar Police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas in 30C heat.

The local health authority provided people with thousands of bottles of water as they wilted in the high temperatures.

Gibraltar's Government later accused Spain of 'torture.'

On Sunday, after creating two days of queues for people trying to get out of Spain, Civil Guards switched tactics and targeted vehicles going the other way.

A Gibraltar-based librarian cycling into Spain was arrested for alleged assault on police in a detention condemned by the Rock's Chief Minister as brutal and barbaric.

Tensions between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar have increased since PM Mariano Rajoy's right-wing government took power in November 2011.

Spanish fishermen say the artificial reef they are fighting against, will affect their catches.

In November last year the Royal Navy's HMS Scimitar was scrambled to intercept a Spanish warship called Vencedora when it entered Britain's territorial waters.

Gibraltar-based delivery driver Dale Cherry, 32, was shot at by police last month as he took a friend out on a jet-ski.

Civil Guard officers later claimed they were pursuing cigarette smugglers and insisted no shots were fired.
