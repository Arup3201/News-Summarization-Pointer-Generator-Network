Charged: Laszlo Csatary was the world's most wanted Nazi for his alleged role in the Holocaust. He is accused of beating jews with his bare hands and a dog whip

The world's number one Nazi war crimes suspect has been arrested in Budapest.

Laszlo Csatary, 97, was taken into custody in the Hungarian capital earlier today.

He is accused of helping to organise the deportation of 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz death camp during the Second World War.

A spokesman for the public prosecutors office in Budapest today said: 'Csatary has been taken into custody.'

He corrected an earlier 
statement that had said the elderly man had been charged with war crimes. 
Further details are expected at a news conference later today.

Csatary - full name Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary - is number one on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's wanted list.

During
 the war, he was a senior police officer in Kosice, which at that time 
was occupied by Nazi ally Hungary and is now in Slovakia.

In
 1948, a Czechoslovakian court condemned Csatary, who the Wiesenthal 
Center said was in charge of the Jewish ghetto in Kosice, to death in 
absentia.

But he had 
made it to Canada, where he worked as an art dealer in Montreal and 
Toronto until in the 1990s he was stripped of his citizenship there and 
was forced to flee.

He 
ended up in Budapest where he has lived undisturbed ever since until the
 Wiesenthal Center alerted Hungarian authorities last year, providing it
 with evidence it said implicated Csatary in war crimes.

He was then tracked down by the Sun newspaper, who photographed him after confronting him at his front door.

Acting on the information provided by
 the Wiesenthal Center, which was supplemented by fresh evidence last 
week over the deportation of some 300 other Jews in 1941, prosecutors 
began an investigation in September.

A statement by prosecutors on Monday, however, appeared to limit the chances that the old man will end up in the dock.

Case: Csatary was a senior police officer at the time he is accused of committing the crimes

The
 events 'took place 68 years ago in an area that now falls under the 
jurisdiction of another country - which also with regard to the related 
international conventions raises several investigative and legal 
problems.'

Efraim 
Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Center's chief Nazi-hunter, said on Sunday that 
he has been 'very upset and very frustrated' about the lack of action by
 Hungarian authorities.

The
 fact that Csatary lived freely in Hungary for some 15 years and the 
lack of progress by prosecutors also added to worries about the 
direction of the EU member state under right-wing Prime Minister Viktor 
Orban.

Almost exactly a
 year ago, a court in Budapest acquitted Hungarian Sandor Kepiro, 97, of
 charges of ordering the execution of over 30 Jews and Serbs in the 
Serbian town of Novi Sad in January 1942.

The
 Wiesenthal Center, which had also listed Kepiro as the most wanted Nazi
 war criminal and helped bring him to court, described the verdict as an
 'outrageous miscarriage of justice'.

Six weeks later Kepiro died.

Recent months have seen something of a
 public rehabilitation of controversial figures, most notably of Miklos 
Horthy, Hungary's dictator from 1920 until falling out with his 
erstwhile ally Adolf Hitler in 1944.

Anti-Semitic
 writers like Albert Wass and Jozsef Nyiro, a keen supporter of the 
brutal Arrow Cross regime installed in power by the Nazis in 1944, have 
also been reintroduced into the curriculum for schools.

Other
 incidents include the verbal assault of a 90-year-old rabbi, Jozsef 
Schweitzer, when a stranger came up to him in the street and said 'I 
hate all Jews!'

The 
decision by the speaker of the Hungarian parliament, Orban ally Laszlo 
Kover, to attend a ceremony in May honouring Nyiro, prompted Nobel 
laureate Elie Wiesel to return Hungary's highest honour in disgust.

Holocaust
 survivor Mr Wiesel, 83, said: 'It has become increasingly clear that 
Hungarian authorities are encouraging the whitewashing of tragic and 
criminal episodes in Hungary's past.'

The
 speaker of Israel's Knesset followed this up by withdrawing an 
invitation to Kover to a ceremony this week in Israel paying tribute to 
Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved Jews during the war.

Hell: Millions lost their lives at Auschwitz Concentration Camp, where Csatary is accused of being complicit in deporting 15,700 to their deaths

Csatary, the former police commander of the Jewish ghetto in Kassa, Hungary, is accused of complicity in transporting thousands to their deaths

Laszlo Csatary is number one on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list of Nazi war criminals known to be alive and at large almost seven decades after the end of the Second World War.

Csatary, 97, is listed by the Vienna-based Nazi-hunters as having 'helped organise the deportation to Auschwitz of approximately 15,700 Jews' from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in early 1944.

The top two names - Alois Brunner and Aribert Heim - are widely suspected to be dead.

The following are the five top remaining names on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list:
