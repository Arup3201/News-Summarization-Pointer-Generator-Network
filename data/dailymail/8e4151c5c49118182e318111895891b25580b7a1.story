Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has raised eyebrows by claiming that Angel Di Maria is city rival Real's best player, above the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.

Simeone watched from the sidelines as his Atletico side held their Madrid rivals to a 1-1 draw in the Spanish Super Cup first leg on Tuesday night.

Di Maria's late introduction from the bench changed the game, with the Argentina winger - a target for Manchester United - setting up an the opening goal for James Rodriguez. Atletico levelled the tie through Raul Garcia with just two minutes remaining.

Simeone hailed Di Maria's impact after the game and insisted it did not surprise him that his compatriot was so effective.

'The game changed with Di Maria,' Simeone said. 'It's logical - he's the best player they have.'

When pressed whether Di Maria deserved to be singled out above Real's so-called galacticos - Ronaldo, Bale and Rodriguez chief among them - Simeone insisted: 'He's the player most likely to create openings in the opposition half.'

It seems the Atletico manager has a point, as his fellow Argentine - while well behind Ronaldo and Bale in terms of goals scored - created the most last season, 22, compared with 11 made by the Portuguese and 16 by the Welshman.

Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti would seem to disagree with his Simeone, however, having started the game with Di Maria on the bench.

That hurts: Cristiano Ronaldo might have something to say about Simeone's claim over Di Maria 

But Louis van Gaal is desperate to add Di Maria to his paper-thin squad at Old Trafford following United's opening-day Premier League defeat at home against Swansea.

United are prepared to commit as much as £100million to their pursuit of Di Maria. Van Gaal needs world-class additions and has told executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to do all he can to bring the 26-year-old winger to the club.

It is understood United have told Di Maria that, with performance-based incentives, they will pay him around £200,000 a week. Over a five-year deal that would take the club's investment to £100m when a transfer fee of around £50m is included.
