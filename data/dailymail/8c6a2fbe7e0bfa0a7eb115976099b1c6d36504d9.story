Booked: Aron Ralston, whose story of amputating his own hand was turned into the film '127 Hours,' had domestic violence charges dropped

The hiker who cut off his own hand to free himself from a Utah canyon and inspired the blockbuster film '127 Hours' has been arrested on domestic violence charges.

Aron Ralston, 38, was booked into the Denver County jail Saturday after police arrested him on suspicion of assault and 'wrongs to minors.'

He was at the home of 38-year-old Vita Shannon at the time of the arrest. She was arrested on the same charges, as well, the Denver Post reports.

The exact circumstances of the 
alleged abuse are not clear and the Denver police are not releasing 
additional details at this time.

Ralston married Jessica Trusty in 
2009 and they couple had a son Leo one year later. It's not known 
whether Ralston and Trusty are still together. 

Ralston previously said the image of his future child helped him decide to cut off his own hand.

Ralston
 made headlines in 2003 when he amputated his right forearm with a 
pocketknife to free himself after a boulder that dislodged and trapped 
him inside a Utah canyon.

Ralston,
 an experienced outdoorsman with a background in mechanical engineering,
 was canyoneering alone in the remote canyon when the mishap occurred.

He wrote a best-seller about his ordeal titled, Between a Rock and a Hard Place.

Hollywood story: Ralston's ordeal of cutting off his own hand became the Academy Award-nominated '127 Hours,' in which he was played by James Franco

In 2010, the story was made into a movie, '127 Hours,' starring James Franco. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

In 2009, he married Jessica Trusty. One year later, their son Leo was born. 

Ralston told film blog Flicks and Bits
 in 2010 that it was a vision of his future son that saved his life and 
helped him decide to cut off his own appendage and survive the ordeal.

'I saw this vision of this little boy and it shifted me. It gave me hope to get out because this is my future son,' he said.

'I
 could see me interacting with him without my hand at some point many 
years down the road and I realized if I’m going to have that son then I 
have to get out of here, I WILL get out of here, it got me through that 
last night.'

Ralston, who 
currently tours the nation as a motivational speaker, has reportedly 
raked in an estimated $4million in speaking fees and royalties from the 
book and movie.

Ralston is scheduled to appear in court on Monday afternoon.

In suspected domestic violence cases, a defendant cannot bond out of jail before appearing before a judge.
