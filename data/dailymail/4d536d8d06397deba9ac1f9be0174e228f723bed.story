In the comedy classic Anchorman, Brian Fantana attempts to attract women using an aftershave dubbed Sex Panther - with limited success - but the filmmakers may have been on to something when it comes to the power of cologne and attraction.

Researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo
in New York discovered that large cats including cheetahs, jaguars and panthers are attracted in various degrees to different scents - with Calvin Klein's Obsession peaking the most interest.

Now biologists are putting these findings to the test in the wild by spraying camera traps with Obsession in order to lure the wild felines into them.

Obsession contains a mixture of 
civetone and vanilla extract.

Civetone is a chemical compound found 
in the scent glands of civets, a term applied to around a dozen mammal 
species found in southeast Asia and Africa.

Early
colognes used civetone derived from the African Civet, officially known
as Civettictis civetta.

Modern-day perfurmes, including Calvin 
Klein's Obsession for Men, use a synthetic version of the scent.

It is thought the compound acts in a similar way to territorial markings, which intrigue the cats enough to make them approach it.

Researchers during the original 2010 study experimented with a range of different fragrances to see how two cheetahs reacted to them.

The cats spent more than 11 minutes - longer than any other scent - sniffing and nuzzling up to a tree sprayed with Obsession for Men.

The Calvin Klein fragrance, pictured left, is popular with jaguars and other large cats because it contains a synthetic version of a chemical taken from the scent glands of nocturnal mammals in Asia and Africa. Sex Panther, right, was a cologne used in the film Anchorman, said to be made from chemicals found in panthers

One program director in Guatemala has 
been using the perfume since 2007 to determine the jaguar's 
population in the jungle.

Roan
Balas McNab who works in a a protected tropical forest uses the 
perfume's unique properties to keep jaguars still enough so he can 
take images of them using motion-sensitive cameras.

'But
this technique is only effective if animals pass through the cameras' 
detection range and we get adequate photos,' McNab told the Wall 
Street Journal.

After hearing about its potency, his team tried spraying the perfume onto a rag tied to a stake in the ground.

'We're
just starting to get an idea of how jaguars behave in their habitat,' McNab said. 'Before we used Obsession for Men we weren't able to get
these images at all.'

Obsession
for Men launched in 1986. Ann Gottlieb, one of the creators of Obsession for Men's scent, said it had synthetic 'animal' notes.

'It's a combination of this lickable vanilla heart married to this fresh green top note - it creates tension. It sparks curiosity with humans and, apparently, animals.'

Miguel Ordeñana, a biologist with the 
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, has been using the scent on 
jaguar camera traps in Nicaragua.
