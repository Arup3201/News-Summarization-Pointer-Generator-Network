Executives at NBC have been forced to deliver a swift and rather blunt response to the rumors they were in talks with Anderson Cooper about taking over from Matt Lauer on the Today show at the end of the year.

NBC allegedly contacted the CNN anchor recently about the move and when $25million-a-year Lauer, found out, he is believed to have exploded and told them he would not support their decision.

But this afternoon, NBC issued a short statement simply saying: 'We are not considering replacing Matt Lauer.'

CNN anchor: NBC executives allegedly contacted Anderson Cooper recently about replacing Matt Lauer at the end of the year when his contract runs out

NBC executives have confirmed they were in touch with Cooper, but not to take over from Lauer.

They said: 'The network has exploratory talks with talent inside and outside of the network. But to read anything specific into that is presumptuous.'

And NBC News senior VP Alexandra Wallace
told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement: 'As we’ve said before, Matt Lauer is the best 
in the business. We want him in the Today show anchor chair for many 
years to come.'

According to The Hollywood Reporter, sources close to Cooper say he is not interested in trading globetrotting for 4am wake up calls and he said recently that he expects new CNN chief Jeff Zucker to keep his program, Anderson Cooper 360 in its 8pm time slot.

But the rumors will undoubtedly rock the Today show boat once again, which is happening more and more frequently in recent weeks.

Yesterday, it was reported that Lauer is furious with the show's producers as he feels they set him up by airing an interview with the controversial filmmaker who made a disturbing documentary about Jerry Sandusky.

The Today co-host believes he was put in the line of fire for getting him to anchor the interview that John Ziegler did with the convicted child rapist and former Penn State assistant football coach.

According to RadarOnline.com: 'Morale just couldn’t get any lower among the cast and crew of Today. Matt feels that he was set up by producers to fail by participating in the interview with Ziegler.

Move: Today show host Matt Lauer was on the brink of moving to rival network ABC last year, it has been claimed

'Matt didn’t think it was a good idea
to air it to begin with. Jerry Sandusky is a convicted child rapist, 
and Matt’s feeling was, let’s talk to the victims, and not him.

'However, he wanted to prove he was a
team player and did it. Producers thought it would generate a lot of 
publicity, but no had any idea it would have garnered so much 
controversy.'

It was first believed that Lauer 
would go to Greene State Correctional Institute in Waynesburg, Centre County, and interview Sandusky himself, but when the 
segment was aired on Monday it became clear it was a preview of The 
Framing of Joe Paterno.

In the documentary, Ziegler calls the
legal case against Sandusky 'remarkably weak' and claims the sexual 
assault Mike McQueary said he saw was actually a 'botched grooming'.

He does however, agree that Sandusky was guilty of 'many, if not all, of the things he was convicted of'.

Lauer is said to be suspicious of the timing of the interview and wonders if the network is setting him up to fail.

It comes just after the news anchor 
did an interview with New York Magazine about the behind-the-scenes 
turmoil surrounding Ann Curry's public ousting.

The source told Radar: 'Matt is trying
to do everything he can to save the sinking ship, but he just doesn’t 
know who he can trust anymore.'

It was also revealed earlier this week that Lauer was on the brink of defecting to rival network ABC last year.

He
is believed to have been was so close to making the move to ABC last 
year that everybody close to the situation thought the deal was 'signed,
sealed and delivered', according to a report.

The
claims emerge amid reports the 55-year-old journalist's $25million NBC 
contract will not be renewed when it expires next year, after the fiasco
surrounding the dismissal of former co-anchor Ann Curry saw his 
popularity with viewers take a nosedive.

ABC chiefs including Bob Iger, CEO of
parent company Disney, and Ben Sherwood, ABC News boss, all thought the
move was confirmed, as did Lauer's agent, according to a report in the New York Post.

The
NBC stalwart would have become an ABC News personality, co-hosted the 
Katie Couric talk show, and taken an occasional role on Good Morning 
America, said the report, which cited New York magazine.

But
the journalist changed his mind and decided to stay at NBC, a decision 
which is said to have left Mr Iger and others 'infuriated'.

The Today show was thrown into turmoil after co-anchor Ann Curry was sacked from her post, and Mr Lauer was not seen to fight for his colleague.

The handling of Ms Curry's dismissal prompted a backlash from viewers of the show, which is now in second place behind Good Morning America in the ratings.

Mr Lauer's Q Score - the television 
industry's measure of popularity - has slumped from 19 last September to
9 in January. Good Morning America host George Stephanopoulos now ranks
higher than Mr Lauer in the popularity stakes for the first time.

Earlier
this month it was reported that the high-profile television 
personality's $25million contract will not be renewed when it expires 
next year.

Willie Geist, 37, and David Gregory, 42, have been named as potential replacements for Mr Lauer in news reports in the U.S.
