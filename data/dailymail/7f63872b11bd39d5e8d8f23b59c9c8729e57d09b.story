People who live in central London are meaner than those in the suburbs, who are happier, calmer and even a little bit boring, a study has revealed.

Residents in Westminster, Camden, Kensington and Chelsea were deemed to be less considerate while those living in Bromley and Croydon were the nicest, according to researchers.

The study by Cambridge University psychologists found those with specific personality traits tended to live in the same area, for example the most sociable people flock to boroughs in south London.

Meanwhile those living in central areas were far more open to trying new experiences than their neighbours on the outskirts, who become progressively less adventurous the further out they are.

The researchers also found higher levels of life satisfaction in the most affluent areas of London and pockets of low life satisfaction in north west, north east, and south London.

In those areas, the most agreeable and conscientious types tended to be slightly more satisfied, suggesting that these traits are more important determinants of life satisfaction. 

Those with the most volatile personalities lived in Hackney, Barnet and Lewisham, while the residents of Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth were most emotionally stable, according to the Telegraph.

The most emotionally stable Londoners live in western central London - areas like Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth - while those in Hackney, Barnet and Lewisham are more volatile, according to the study

There are higher levels of life satisfaction in the most affluent areas of London (west central) and pockets of low life satisfaction in north west, north east, and south London

While the study, undertaken by an international team of researchers, shows the most miserable Londoners live in Hounslow, Ealing, Hillingdon, Barking and Dagenham, Newham and Harrow. 

Psychologists found the least agreeable areas were in western central London - an area with the highest crime rate, busiest pedestrian traffic and some of the highest housing prices in the capital.

Researchers believe this could support the idea that residents of big cities tend to be less considerate towards other people.

Dr Markus Jokela, from the University of Helsinki in Finland, said: 'It’s very common for people to talk about where is the best place to live.

'But most research has tended to look at factors such as income and low crime rates, and only on a very broad geographical scale, failing to consider individual differences in personality. 

'As a result, studies imply that all people would be equally happy in the same places. 

'It’s a one-size-fits-all conclusion that, as we show, is misleading because one’s level of happiness is dependent on whether their environment is suited to their personality.'

Dr Jason Rentfrow, from the Department of Psychology at Cambridge University, said the findings could prove useful for those deciding on an area to live.

He said: 'Together, these findings not only add to our understanding of the ways in which features of our personalities relate to our physical environments, but they also provide potentially useful information for choosing a place to live.

'Granted, most people don't have the luxury of complete control over where they live, but given their budgets, people can decide whether it's more important to live in the centre of town, where daily life is vibrant and accommodation is small, or further out where daily life is slower but space is more plentiful. 

'Making the decision that fits with your personality could have an effect on your overall life satisfaction.'

Psychologists used data from the BBC's Big Personality Test and honed in on the 56,000 Londoners to examine how associations between personality and life satisfaction differed across the 216 postal districts.

The research, funded by the Kone Foundation and the Academy of Finland, was published  in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Those most open to trying new experiences live closest to the centre of the capital, with suburb residents significantly less adventurous
