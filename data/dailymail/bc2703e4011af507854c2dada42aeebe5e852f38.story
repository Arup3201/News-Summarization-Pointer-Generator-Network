Oscar-nominated actress Michelle Williams appeared in a Brooklyn court Tuesday to offer evidence against her filmmaker friend's former boyfriend in a vicious custody battle rife with allegations of cheating, arsenic poisoning and gruesome dismemberment fantasies.

New York-based novelist and movie producer Galt Niederhoffer, 38, and her former partner, prominent corporate attorney Jonathan Gordon, 40, are locked in a legal war over their 2-year-old son.

Niederhoffer lost custody of the toddler last month after her own father, financial investor and former squash champion Victor Niederhoffer, took Gordon’s side in the legal tug-of-war and accused his daughter of being a danger to his grandchild.

Famous friend: Actress Michelle Williams arrived wrote in an affidavit that Gordon, a high-powered attorney,  was tremendously angry and emotionally manipulative  

In her affidavit filed in Brooklyn Supreme Court Tuesday and cited by the New York Post, Michelle Williams, 34, painted Gordon as a verbally abusive and rage-filled man.

'To be around Jonathan is to be in the presence of a tremendous and unsettling amount of anger that is barely held below the surface,' the star of Blue Valentine wrote.

Williams accused Gordon of humiliating the mother of his child in her presence and waging what she described as 'psychological warfare' against her.

Williams, who had a daughter in 2005 with the late actor Heath Ledger, said that she and Niederhoffer became very close in the last couple of years because their daughters are nearly the same age.

Ms Williams sat by her friend's side in court Tuesday but did not testify during the hearing.

Besides the award-winning actress, movie magnate Harvey Weinstein also has come out in support of Niederhoffer, praising her as a devoted mother in a letter submitted as part of the case.

Hollywood heavyweight: Niederhoffer is best known for producing the 2010 film The Romantics, based on an eponymous novel she published in 2008

Ms Niederhoffer, a Harvard-educated filmmaker and mother of three, is best known for producing the 2010 film 'The Romantics' starring Katie Holmes, Josh Duhamel and Anna Paquin. The movie was based on an eponymous novel she published in 2008.

In court documents, Niederhoffer accused her ex-boyfriend, the in-house counsel for media mogul Barry Diller, of repeatedly cheating on her and lacing her food with arsenic.

Gordon responded to the allegations by calling his ex mentally ill and in need of psychiatric care - a claim backed by her own father.

However, a blood test conducted at New York Presbyterian Hospital in January found potentially toxic levels on arsenic in Niederhoffer's sytem.

The high-profile attorney said Niederhoffer began falsely accusing him of infidelity in 2013, about two years into their relationship.

The 38-year-old producer stated in legal documents that her boyfriend used to dream about killing her, chopping up her body and dumping the remains behind their home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn.

Niederhodffer, whose 2005 novel A Taxonomy of Barnacles is currently being adapted for the big screen with a star-studded cast, has compared her predicament to the 1944 noir classic Gaslight, where a husband attempts to convince his wife, played by Ingrid Bergman, that she is going insane.

According to Ms Niederhoffer, in November 2014, Gordon picked up for her some odd-smelling whitefish. Suspicious, she sent the food to a lab for testing, and the toxicology report allegedly showed high levels of arsenic and other heavy metals.

The same poison was also discovered in her blood.

The already acrimonious custody battle is further complicated by assault charges against Niederhoofder, who allegedly slammed her stepmother's head against the wall following a court hearing.

Jonathan Gordon is also facing legal troubles after allegedly trying to choke his ex-girlfriend in bed last month.
