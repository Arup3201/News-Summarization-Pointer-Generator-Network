Journalists have been tweeting all manner of mishaps at the Sochi games - from unfinished hotels to undrinkable water - but for Bob Costas, it's gotten far more personal.

The sportscaster revealed during a broadcast on Thursday night that he has contracted an eye infection while in Russia - and has been forced to don a pair of glasses while it heals.

Costas' eye was decidedly red, watery and swollen behind his specs. During the broadcast, he addressed his new look.

New look: Sportscaster Bob Costas debuted a new look during Olympic coverage after an eye infection he caught while in Sochi forced him to wear glasses

'Bear with me for a moment as I spare my 
friends in the press office countless inquiries,' he said.

'I have no choice to go 
all Peabody and Sherman on you for the next couple of nights since I 
woke up this morning with my left eye swollen shut and just about as red
 as the old Soviet flag.

'According to the NBC doctors here, it's some 
kind of minor infection which should resolve itself by the weekend. If 
only all my issues would resolve themselves that quickly, but that's 
another story.'

His assistant added to Deadspin that the infection has left it impossible for Costas to wear contact lenses but that it should resolve itself by the weekend.

Sore: Costas, pictured left on Thursday and without his glasses, right, said he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red 'as the Soviet flag'. It will take a couple of days to heal, he said

Following the primetime broadcast, the eye became a trending topic on Twitter, spawning numerous jokes and even a parody account.

Some users poked fun at the disasters that already unfolded before the opening ceremony even began.

'Bob Costas left eye will eat his right one if he keeps drinking that Sochi water,' one quipped.

Another added: 'Sochi highlights so far are inhumane living conditions, stray dogs and Costas' pink eye. It's a proud moment for Russia.'
