Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams quipped she is now in ‘better shape’ than when she stripped off for a recent magazine shoot.

The 34-year-old followed her sister Serena by posing naked for ESPN’s ‘Body Issue’ and also bared all about her battle with Sjögren’s syndrome, an incurable condition that causes muscle soreness, making her ‘so tired it hurts’.

Williams missed last year’s Wimbledon but achieved her 72nd win on the grass of SW19, the most of any current female player, beating Spain’s Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor in three sets.

‘I think I’m in better shape now than when we did the pictures,’ said Williams, smiling. ‘Hopefully we can do a re-shoot!

‘I think I did it because Serena did it. She was a big influence on me.’

Some thought Williams’ illness might prompt her retirement, but the former world No 1 appears as determined as ever.

Asked how many Wimbledon titles she has won, Williams, who faces Kurumi Nara in the next round, said: ‘Not enough.’

The American added: ‘I have nothing to prove, nothing to hide, nothing to lose.’
