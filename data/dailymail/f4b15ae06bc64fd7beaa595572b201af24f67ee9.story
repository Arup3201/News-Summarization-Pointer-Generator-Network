History of mental illness: Ryan Carnan rode a tractor through normally serene Simi Valley, California streets firing a gun after killing his mother and torching her home

On a the normally quiet California street called Mellow Lane, the peace was shattered Saturday when a 29-year-old man gunned down his mother, set her house ablaze, and then took a tractor on a crazed ride through the streets in which he fired randomly at passersby and police.

The mayhem began around 5pm when police say Ryan Carnan murdered his mother at her Simi Valley home and then admitted the crime to his brother.

The brother’s panicked phone call to police would come after the home was engulfed by flames and around the same time calls about a man shooting at people in the Los Angeles suburb’s streets began flooding in.

Authorities found the charred remains of the still-unnamed mother before pursuing Carnan.Carnan attempted to flee by tractor onto an equestrian trail when police confronted him and he was shot dead.

Police
spokeswoman Stephanie Shannon said officers caught up with Carnan in 
the Bridle Path area of Simi Valley. Still armed, he was riding the 
tractor at the bottom of the city’s foothills.

‘Faced with a deadly force situation, those officers were involved in an officer-involved shooting,’ she said.

The
area bomb squad was called as shocked denizens of the normally serene 
neighborhood became targets of the deranged man and were even told to 
evacuate.

comes by and I said, “Are you shooting up there?” Then he looks at me 
with the gun. He has the gun,’ said resident and witness Norm Treveva 
told KTLA. ‘I said: “Oh. You are shooting up there.” He just stared at 
me with this really weird-looking look on his face. Then he just drove 
by.”

She said she looked over to see a man with a gun firing at her.She wasn't hit.

Witness Anthony Maciel described the arrival of tactical teams.

‘Police
are showing up. They’ve got tactical vests and M4s,’ he told KTLA. 
‘They’re moving up the street, telling us to get out. Like, “Get 
inside.”’

Marciel was among the extremely startled, but only Carnan’s mother appears to been injured at the hands of her son.

‘Based on the information that was being received by the 911 callers that a subject was actively shooting a firearm in a residential neighborhood,’ read the release, ‘the heroic actions of the officers involved cannot be understated.’
