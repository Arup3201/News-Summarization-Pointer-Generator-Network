Multi-millionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins has appeared on Bloomberg TV to address the outrage over his comments in an op ed to the wall Street Journal comparing the 'progressive war on the one percent' to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany.

The appearance was less an apology and more a re-assertion of his viewpoints, with some bragging about his wealth thrown in.

Perkins said he 'regrets' using the word Kristallnacht but said he does not regret the message 'at all.'

In danger: The 'creative one per cent' says Perkins, is being threatened

After mentioning that he had spoken to Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League - twice - Perkins said that Kristallnacht was a 'terrible word to have chosen,' but apparently did not regret the broader comparision of the 'demonization' of the one per cent with Nazism.

Perkins said he used the word because during Occupy San Francisco, 'they broke the windows at Wells Fargo bank, they marched up to our automobile strip and broke all the windows in the luxury car dealerships.'

He noticed police standing by watching, he said, and thought, 'Well, this is how Kristallnacht began.'

Interviewer Emily Chang questions Perkins as to the relevance of the analogy, to which Perkins responds:

'The Jews were only one per cent of the German population. Most Germans had never met a Jew. And yet Hitler was able to demonize the Jews,' he said.

'My point was that when you start to use hatred against a minority, it can get out of control.

'The creative one per cent are threatened.'

Useful: Perkins with his 'underwater airplane'

He goes on to say that his friend and former business partner Eugene Kleiner, who fled to Austria to escape the Nazis, would have agreed with him - if he was still alive.

When asked what should be done to improve the lives of 'the 99 per cent,' Perkins said, 'I think that the solution is less interference, lower taxes, let the rich do what the rich do — which is get richer, and along the way they bring everybody else along with them, when the system is working.'

Bafflingly, Perkins took the opportunity to point out that his watch - a Richard Mille - 'could buy a six-pack of Rolexes' and smugly corrected Chang on his 'underwater airplane.'

The final nail in his coffin may have been when he spoke of the reason for his inflammatory letter in the first place: someone called his ex-wife romance novelist Danielle Steele a 'snob.'

This offensive slight sent the self-described 'classical self-made man' into defense mode.

'So I thought since I'm a knight - I'm a literal knight of the Kingdom of Norway - I would get on my horse and charge forth in her defense,' he told a bemused Chang.

Shining armor: Perkins didn't appreciate his former wife Danielle Steele being labeled a snob - so wrote an inflammatory letter comparing the one per cent to persecuted Jews in WWII

Perkins, who repeatedly spoke of his 'message' helpfully boiled it down to the viewer to this:

'It's absurd to demonize the rich for doing what the rich do, which is get richer by creating opportunity for others.

'I think the solution is less interference, lower taxes, let the rich do what the rich do.'

The California one per center was widely ridiculed after the Wall Street Journal published his letter comparing criticism of the super-rich to the Holocaust.

He wrote another letter Sunday, this time to Bloomberg, in which he compared the 'Occupy' movement to pre-Nazi rise to power fascism in Germany.

'In the Nazi area it was racial demonization, now it is class demonization,' wrote the Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers venture capital firm co-founder.

He also expressed 'shock' over the windows broken at luxury dealerships and banks in San Francisco while the press 'focuses its wrath on the one per cent.

The letter was written as a KPCB spokesperson immediately moved to distance itself from Perkins.

'Tom Perkins has not been involved in KPCB for years,' the firm tweeted. 'We were shocked by his views expressed today in the WSJ and do not agree.'

Today, Perkins suggested the firm had 'thrown him under a bus,' and hinted that it was suffering in his absence.

'As I’ve distanced myself from the firm, there’s been a corresponding decline in the firm,' he told Chang.

The second letter was written after Bloomberg contacted Perkins to clarify what he meant in his original letter to the Wall Street Journal, according to Business Insider.

Perkins opened his letter to the Journal: 'Writing from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its "one per cent," namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the "rich."'

Mr Perkins describing the hatred attracted by Google workers in San Francisco and an incident in which his former wife author Danielle Steele was branded a 'snob' in the San Francisco Chronicle in a row over the height of her hedge.

'This is a very dangerous drift in our American thinking. Kristallnacht was unthinkable in 1930; is its descendent "progressive" radicalism unthinkable now?' he continued.

Kristallnacht translates as 'The night of broken glass' and refers to coordinated attacks on Jews in Germany on November 9 1938, as authorities looke on and did nothing.

Superyacht: Mr Perkins commissioned the $150m yacht Maltese Falcon which he later sold

Mr Perkins, 82, was educated at MIT before gaining an MBA from Harvard. He founded Venture capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1973 and has served as a director on boards of companies including Compaq.

He recently spent $150 million building a super yacht called Maltese Falcon and lives on a 60th floor, 5,500ft penthouse overlooking San Francisco Bay.

Before that, he was a general manager 
credited with building Hewlett Packard into the huge company it is known
 as today and started a successful laser company based on his own 
invention.

Comparisons: Mr Perkins referenced the Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany in 1938

Protests: Mr Perkins also discusses the protests in San Francisco against Google buses and tech workers driving up the area's cost of living

His comments comparing criticism of the rich to the Nazis persecution of the Jews that resulted in six million deaths raised many an eyebrow.

'The parallel of Nazi Germany and some people getting kind of annoyed by the tech bro dudes is exactly ZERO,' Kaili Joy Gray wrote on the Wonkette blog.

Author and New York Times writer Steven Greenhouse tweeted: 'As someone who lost numerous relatives to the Nazi gas chambers, I find statements like this revolting & inexplicable.'
