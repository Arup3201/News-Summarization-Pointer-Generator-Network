Since wowing the world on the Olympic track and dazzling on the Strictly Come Dancing dance floor, Victoria Pendleton's career shows no sign of abating - and she is loving every minute.

Not only has she fronted million pound campaigns and written a bestselling autobiography, but she has also ditched her Lycra leggings and firmly established herself on the fashion scene with designers bending over backwards for her to wear their designs and grace the front rows of their shows.

The 32-year-old does, however, maintain that she isn't a 'fashion girl' at all; even though she wishes she was.

Queen Victoria: Victoria Pendleton launches the Royal Ascot The Colour and the Glory campaign in Hyde Park dressed in an Emilia Wickstead hat, but maintains she isn't girly

'I'm not a fashiony girl at all really. I wish I was, I'd like to be. I like reading fashion magazines and I've gone to a couple of fashion shows but that's as far as my whole fashion knowledge and experience goes,' she told MailOnline.

While she may not consider herself a fashionista yet, she is certainly doing a good job of brushing up on her knowledge from the front row of many prestigious shows.

'I really like Stella McCartney, obviously. She did such a great job at the Olympics and she's been very helpful for finding things when I've had events, she has always helped me out.

'I went to Stella's Paris show last season; that was pretty exciting,' she said.

And it seems that Stella isn't her only fashionable friend.

'I'm
a big fan of Paul Smith and he's a big cycling fan. He leaves me voice 
messages when I've gone to competitions to wish me luck and to 
congratulate me.'

As pretty as a flower: Victoria looked stunning in her shoot today but says she prefers brogues and 'manly' buttoned up shirts

With her grueling Olympic training and 
Strictly sessions long behind her, she is using her time to catch up on 
some much-needed retail therapy, which she describes as 'a whole new world'.

While we were most accustomed to seeing 
her in tight Lycra or glitzy Strictly dresses, Victoria considers her 
signature style to be a little more mainstream and practical, counting 
her favourite high street shops as Whistles and Zara.

She said: 'It's definitely nice to be 
out of Lycra and tracksuits. I had a bit of a tidy up in my wardrobe as 
was like: "Wow I do have a lot of leggings, wow nobody needs this 
many pairs of leggings and this many pairs of cycling shorts really!" I 
realised how few regular clothes I actually own.'

Out of lycra: Victoria says she is relieved to be able to wear normal clothes and has been catching up on shopping

Glitz and glam: She loved wearing the glitzy dresses on the Strictly dance floor but maintains that brogues and shirts are more her signature style

Talking about her personal style she said: 'I don't know if 
it sounds quite masculine and androgynous but I do like brogues and 
buttoned up shirts - that's the kind of thing I like and I feel very comfortable
dressed like that.

'I'd like to wear lots of girly things but I never feel like it's me so I probably dress a little bit more practically.'

She did have a chance to embrace her inner girly side on the dance floor in Strictly Come Dancing, and while she may have been the seventh contestant to leave the show and fast became notorious for her tearful outbursts, she maintains that she loved her time on the show.

'It was a wonderful experience and I really 
enjoyed it. I
loved wearing the glitzy dresses. It was really nice to wear something that is so far from 
what you'd normally wear. But you wouldn't go out on a Saturday night dressed like 
that!

'It was really fun to dress up. I loved dressing up as a kid, my 
nanny used to make me skirts and sparkly stuff so how could you not 
enjoy that?'

And with many of her fellow Olympians 
such as Jessica Ennis and Louis Smith voicing their dreams of launching a
fashion line, Victoria has had a very similar brainwave.

'I
would love to start a fashion line. I would really like to start with 
women's cyclewear because I think there's not a lot of stuff out there 
to choose from in terms of functional sports wear.'

For now, Victoria's latest project is launching the Royal Ascot 2013 campaign 'The Colour and the Glory'.

Sporting
a hat by Philip Treacy and dress by designer, Emilia Wickstead - 
Victoria braved the cold elements in a stunning photo shoot that 
celebrates classic British style and fashion.

Her trim body is the result of her new found hobby: running.

'I started running, I've never been 
allowed to run before because it's banned. With cycling you don't 
run in case of damaging tendons or getting injured.

'I run with my dogs 
and I'm really enjoying it. I know it sounds really sad but the freedom of
being able to do it is just so enjoyable,' she said.

Big spender: Her favourite high street stores are Whistles and Zara and when she has a splurge, she loves Paul Smith

Front row: She is a regular front row attendee and loved her time in Paris at Stella McCartney's spring/summer 13 show

Speaking about being a part of Royal Ascot, she said: 'I was absolutely thrilled to be asked to take part in the shoot today, and I am a big fan of Emilia Wickstead and Philip Treacy.

'I have always loved Royal Ascot and have been several times, it’s one of the most exciting events of the summer social season and I was lucky enough to be asked to present the trophy for The Britannia Stakes a few years ago.

'In many ways, with horses coming from all around the world to run at Royal Ascot, it is just like the Olympic games.'
