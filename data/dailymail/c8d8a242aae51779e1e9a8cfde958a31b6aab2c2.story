Ed Miliband was under fire from business leaders to today after kicking off the Labour Party conference with a general election pledge to increase the minimum wage to at least £8 an hour.

The Labour party leader said the current £6.31 level - which is set to rise to £6.50 next month - was leaving ordinary workers out of pocket.

Mr Miliband's proposed increase, which would be introduced gradually between 2015 and 2020 - would add around £3,000 a year to the pay packets of those earning the minimum wage.

But business groups said if the minimum wage was increased any further it would hit jobs.

Labour leader Ed Miliband announced his party's flagship promise for the next election - a rise in the minimum wage to £8 an hour - on the first day of the party conference in Manchester today

Mr Miliband said people across the UK felt the economy was not working for them. He said many of the 1.6 million Scottish voters who backed independence felt they had nothing to lose from leaving the UK

Katja Hall of the business organisation the CBI said the minimum wage had already reached ‘the highest rate it can be without putting job creation at risk’.

She said: ‘It has risen more than average earnings throughout the recession and recovery and is set to increase by more than 3 per cent from October.’

Ms Hall also raised concerns that Mr Miliband was politicising the wage, which has been in the hands of the independent Low Pay Commission.

She said: ‘The national minimum wage has enjoyed broad business support and a move to a politicised US-style system is not in the interest of companies or workers.

‘Raising wages in this way would put serious strain on businesses, particularly hard-pressed smaller firms with tight margins, which would end up employing fewer people.’

John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce added: ‘Businesses are in favour of an evidence based approach to the minimum wage rather than political parties using it to gain support from voters.

‘The Government should not intervene in such matters, unless there is market failure.’

John Allan, from the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said he was ‘increasingly concerned’ that the minimum wage was ‘becoming a political football’.

Labour claims there are around 1.4 million people who would benefit from the pay hike. 

The announcement signals the start of a Labour blitz on stagnating living standards under the Coalition, as the party gears up for the general election next year.

Mr Miliband said: ‘One in five of the men and women employed in Britain today do the hours, make their contribution, but find themselves on low pay.

‘But if you work hard, you should be able to bring up your family with dignity.’

Mr Miliband added: ‘This week Labour's Plan for Britain's Future will show how we can change and how we can become a country that rewards hard work once again. Because Labour is the party of hard work, fairly paid.’

He revealed that he was inspired to increase the basic wage after meeting a woman who worked in Burger King.

He said: 'She had worked there for six years and I think she was number two there, but was paid just above the minimum wage.'

Mr Miliband was joined in Manchester by Labour's leading female MPs, including Harriet Harman (left, grey jacket) and Gloria de Piero (right, white dress)

The planned increase, which would affect around 1.4 million jobs, would be introduced in annual stages by the Low Pay Commission before October 2019.

The promised rate is said to be similar to that in force in Australia and EU countries such as Belgium and Germany, but still lower than in France and New Zealand. 

Responding to the announcement, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the Tories would not take any ‘lectures from Labour’ on helping people on low pay.

He said: ‘By crashing the economy, Labour made everyone poorer. And they haven't learnt their lesson. Ed Miliband would make people worse off with the same failed policies that got us into a mess in the first place - more wasteful spending, more borrowing and higher taxes.’

But shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the policy was a win-win because people would earning more and paying more in tax.

Mr Miliband added: ‘It is actually going to save money in benefits.’

The Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘What is happening at the moment is that we are spending billions of pounds subsidising employers who are paying low wages, billions of pounds in benefits, tax credits and housing benefit.

‘It is going to have no cost at all to the public sector, and it is the Government's own figures that say that... For every extra pound that the minimum wage goes up, some estimates say that we will save 50p in benefits and extra tax revenue. As the private sector pays more in the minimum wage, we save money in benefits and tax payments.

‘I can assure you, it doesn't cost money, it saves money. It saves hundreds of millions of pounds in getting the welfare bill down.’
