A mother-of-two who went to extraordinary lengths to con her family and friends out of thousands of dollars by convincing them she was dying of cancer has been sentenced to just community service.

Lori Stilley, 41, from Delran, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in May to theft by deception for receiving $12,000 from more than 300 people across 20 states after falsely claiming she had bladder cancer. She even deceived her own children into believing she was dying.

On Thursday, she was sentenced to 500 hours of community service - the maximum amount of time - but did not receive a prison term as she still has custody of her daughter, 13, and son, eight.

Superior Court Judge James W. Palmer Jr. said that Stilley not only terrified her children with her tearful claims - but that she maintained the cancer was real and only pleaded guilty because she could not afford a trial.

'I have never heard of such an outrageous thing,' he told Stilley in the courtroom, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 'I'm almost speechless. It's despicable what you've done.'

Stilley went to extraordinary lengths
to dupe her friends, family and strangers, even writing a book about 
her experience, making t-shirts and holding fund-raisers in the scam.

In February 2011, Stilley told those close to her and posted on Facebook that she had been diagnosed with cancer.

In April, she said her condition had 
worsened, and supporters quickly raised more than $12,000 
for medical expenses, prepared her meals and even paid for the 
'inspirational' mother's wedding.

Her
'Team Lori Rocks' support page on Facebook attracted more than 300 
friends, all eager to make the New Jersey woman's life as happy as 
possible in her last few months.

When they learned she wanted to marry
her boyfriend William before she died, her army of supporters donated 
their own money to pay for her wedding.

She
penned a 306-page e-book, I'Mpossible - How a Facebook Group Loved Me 
Through Cancer and sold it on her website, earning $3,000 from it, 
authorities said.Â 

She 
wrote: 'I pray I will be around to look at this book 20 years from now 
with my children. If not, I have a sense of peace knowing they have 
their Mommy's story to keep for the rest of their lives. I'm still 
waiting on that miracle.'

But, after suddenly announcing a 'miraculous recovery' in November, suspicion arose around the mother-of-two's 'condition'.

Supporters realized they had not seen 
any medical bills or doctor's notes, and no one had been with her when 
she had visited the hospital for her cancer.

Stilley was never treated or even diagnosed with cancer, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office and Delran police said.

Prosecutor
Robert D. Bernardi said in a statement: 'To represent that she was 
dying from this terrible disease for the sake of personal gain and 
sympathy goes way beyond simply being a criminal offense; it was 
extremely cruel to those who were concerned and worked hard to lend 
assistance.'

At her sentencing, Stilley's attorney, Adam S. Malamut, presented the judge with letters from family members and friends asking that she received a lenient sentence of just 100 hours.

Hurtful: She was sentenced to 500 hours of community service after family members said she had inflicted unimaginable distress on relatives - including children who now needed counseling

But Stilley's own younger sister and ex-husband both asked the judge to impose the maximum allowable punishment because of the grief she had put the family and children through.

Her sister, Lisa DiGiovanni sobbed as she recounted how her sister told her in January 2011 that she had developed a small tumor - before later learning she had Stage III bladder cancer.

'I couldn't sleep,' she said. 'My life became consumed with helping Lori.'

She said her two children have been devastated by learning that their aunt deceived them, and that her teenage son has needed counseling to deal with depression as a result.

'My sister faked an illness, but she has taken so many lives' DiGiovanni told the judge.

Free: The judge did not give her prison time as she still has custody of her two children

Stilley's ex-husband, Brian Schenski, added that his 13-year-old daughter had left her fearful to visit him or go to school as she was worried 'that Mommy would die when she was not home'.

He said that Stilley once even yelled at her daughter after an argument: 'How could you be so mean when you know Mommy's dying?'

Judge Palmer added that he was shocked that Stilley apparently had such little remorse.

'You didn't appear to be serious about this offense, and this disturbs me,' he said. 'You've got to understand that this was just awful.'
