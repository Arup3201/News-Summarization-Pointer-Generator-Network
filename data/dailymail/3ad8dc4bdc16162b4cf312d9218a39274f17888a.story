A dairy has shocked its customers by telling them they need to telephone the Philippines to order their daily milk deliveries.

Instead of ringing the Dairy Crest depot two miles up the road, residents of Westgate, Gloucester, have been told to contact a call centre in Manila, 7,000 miles away.

Tory Councillor Pam Tracey said: 'They have sent us all a letter saying they want us to pay by direct debit, but how do we know what milk we want or don't want on a daily basis?

Dairy Crest claim customers have said their delivery service has improved since outsourcing customer calls

'And after all of these years I have decided to stop my milk being delivered. And people in the road have stopped theirs.

'Having to ring the Philippines is diabolical.'

A Dairy Crest spokesman has said many customer calls were handled within depots but around 60 per cent of these were not being answered.

The spokesman declined to say why the company would not hire a full-time staff member to respond to customers who phone in, but said 'we're trying to compete with all the other retailers'.

Under the current arrangements, more than 90 per cent of enquiries are picked up.

'Many long time customers have said their service has improved,' the spokesman claimed.

Landscape gardener from Denmark Road, Rob Bennett, said he ordered milk three times a week via direct debit.

'You can change your order the night before, I find there's no problem with it,' he said.

'It's far more cost effective but I think it's a generational thing, some are technophobes and still like to order with the milkman.'

Dairy Crest has said residents who prefer to pay in cash can still do so and in most cases offers doorstep customers a choice of payment options.

They can either pay the milkman directly on a prearranged day or pay online.

The spokesman said: 'If they choose to pay online we ask customers to register to create an account to set up a direct debit or automatic credit card payment and there is no minimum order.

'They can change or amend an order up until 9pm the night before and when an order is amended a new bill is generated so they are not charged for milk or products they have not had.

'With regard to the customers in Henry Road, we can confirm that a new roundsman has recently taken on this area and will be contacting them to arrange a collection time.'

An agent for the call centre in the Philippines, who answered a UK local phone number on Dairy Crest's website, confirmed their base was in Manilla but declined to give the name of the company.

'I'm afraid I'm not allowed do that,' the representative said.

The agent said they answer Dairy Crest customer calls up to 5pm evening time in the U.K.
