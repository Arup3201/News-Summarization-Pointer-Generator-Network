It’s the relationship advice that you definitely won’t find in her book.

‘Princeton Mom’ Susan Patton stole her husband away from his first wife after meeting him at work, MailOnline can reveal.

Patton, 59, sparked a national conversation and won infamy for herself when she wrote an article urging young women to find a husband while at college - ideally Princeton, her alma mater - and not put their careers first.

But she her adamantly declined to talk about her own marital past, aside 
from revealing that she is divorced and has two sons. Now MailOnline can
 reveal that her ex is advertising executive Steve Jaffe.

It was Patton’s first day working at an advertising agency in the 1980’s when she spotted Jaffe on the job and shocked colleagues over a meet-and-greet lunch by saying: ‘I’m gonna marry that man!’

Marry Smart:  Princeton Mom Susan Patton's advice to young women is to invest the same time in finding the right man as they do in their careers. But she admits she didn't practice what she preached

Revealed! This is the ex. Princeton Mom Patten was determined to marry Steve Jaffe the moment she saw him on her first day at work in the '80's. They have since divorced

When they protested that he was already happily married, she ignored them and began a years-long process of ‘wearing him down’.

Jaffe stood no chance against brassy Patton who ‘bowled him over’ - and swept his wife aside.

Earlier this year she wrote a book, Marry Smart, expounding on her theory and was condemned by feminists who said that she taking women back to the 1950s.

But she her adamantly declined to talk about her own marital past aside from revealing that she is divorced and has two sons.

In interviews Patton has admitted that she did not follow her own advice, but only now can the full story be told.

When she met Jaffe they were both in their late 20s and the agency they worked for was Siebel/Mohr, run by famed illustrator Fritz Siebel when the industry was in the last throes of the Mad Men age.

Ouch: Patton chided her ex for not attending a prestigious ivy league college. Good-humored Jaffe made a joke of it on his LinkedIn page

Jaffe, now a pudgy, balding 60, came from the unglamorous Jamaica neighborhood of Queens in the city and attended a humble college on Long Island.

Patton would later snobbily refer to it as a ‘college of almost no name recognition’. And Jaffe would later use the line in his LinkedIn profile.

She herself had come from the Bronx, a tough borough of New York, and was raised by Eastern European immigrant parents who were both Holocaust survivors before she was accepted at the prestigious Princeton University.

By the time Patton joined the advertising agency as an account executive, Jaffe was already well established.

He was also married to his first wife, Robin, who is now 61.

School daze: Patton gloats about her Princeton roots, but she was so eager to get married and have kids she settled for someone who went to a 'college of almost no name recognition'

A source told MailOnline: ‘It was Susan’s very first day and she had lunch with a few of her colleagues, a get to know you kind of thing.

‘Steve was there too but he wasn’t at the table so Susan, bold as brass, tells them: ‘I’m gonna marry that man!’

‘I think everyone was a bit taken aback.

‘His wife was really nice, a calm person. She was like a librarian - she didn’t have a chance against Susan.

‘Steve was a mellow kind of guy. He was popular with the ladies, he was easygoing. He was too passive, that was his problem.

‘It took a few years but she managed to wear him down. Steve was just too nice and so was his wife. Susan bowled them over. She wouldn’t take no for an answer’.

Jaffe moved to advertising firms Promotional Campaigns and Ogilvy and Mather before founding his own company, which he runs to this day under the name Jaffe and Partners.

Patton’s decision to stick with Jaffe appears to be more functional than romantic.

In an interview she said: ‘After I graduated I spent years dating men who were not nearly as good as the men in my class.

‘Ultimately I married the man I was dating when I was 31, because I was running out of time to have children.'

They have two sons are Alex, 21, a senior at Princeton, where he is studying art history and Daniel, 25, who studied history at Princeton and then went to New York University Law School. He now works at a Manhattan law firm.

A video from Daniel’s wedding at the swanky Water Club in Manhattan shows him getting married to a young woman named Natasha, 25, who studied computer science at Princeton and is now an analyst at Citibank.

Her Princeton credentials are impeccable -  even her father Robert attended the college, where he studied mathematics.

The wedding video includes a shot of Patton grinning broadly, no doubt delighted that her older son was doing what she says - and not what she herself did.

Patton’s reputation comes from the blunt nature of the advice in her book ‘Marry Smart: Advice for Finding the One’, which has been branded everything from ‘sexist’ to ‘slapdash’.

It includes advice to women such as: ‘Potential buyers are unmotivated if offered free merchandise, i.e., it’s the lonely cow that gives away free milk’.

She also blamed women if they get sexually assaulted while drunk and said the term ‘date rape’ was too ‘politically correct’.

There was also this missive: ‘If you’ve struggled with obesity through most of your teen years, then maybe surgical intervention is a good idea for you’.

There is little advice about what to do if a relationship ends however, so it might prove useful to see what happened in Patton’s case.

A source told MailOnline that on the first day of her divorce hearing Patton was in court but told the judge to stop when he announced that proceedings had got underway.

Patton said that they had to wait until Mr Jaffe arrived, but the judge informed her he was in fact already present.

Patton turned and looked her soon-to-be ex and said: ‘Oh my god! He’s got so fat!’

Jaffe declined to comment to MailOnline but said in an email: ‘As tempted as I am to voice my perspective on Susan, her book and her opinions, out of respect for my sons' privacy, I will refrain from doing so.’
