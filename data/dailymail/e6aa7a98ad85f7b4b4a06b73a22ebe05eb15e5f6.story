A Zumba instructor says her devotion to the fitness classes nearly killed her - after they caused an undetected hole in her heart to grow bigger and bigger.

Nicole Saville, 20, had to have her chest cut open in January to allow doctors to sew up the hole which was 'insignificant’ when she was born.

The fitness fanatic from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, first noticed something was awry when she became tired and breathless, but never suspected it could be something so serious.

Nicole Saville, 20, was diagnosed with a hole in the heart after becoming tired and breathless. The Zumba instructor had probably had the hole since birth but her active lifestyle could have made it worse

Without major open-heart surgery, Ms Saville would have been at risk of suffering a severe heart attack or stroke as the hole in her heart caused one side of the vital organ to become enlarged.

She said: 'I wasn’t feeling well at all. I was really run down and I was finding teaching difficult.

'Doctors did a series of tests and found an infection, which led them to tell me I had a virus in my liver.

'I put up with it for a couple of months until I started having trouble breathing and I was admitted to hospital.'

Further tests and an ECG revealed Ms Saville had a heart murmur and an ultrasound soon found the hole in her heart - something that she is likely to have had since birth.

Doctors told her the hole could have been made worse by exercise.

In January, surgeons at Leeds General Infirmary performed open-heart surgery on the Zumba instructor after a keyhole procedure failed.

Surgeons tried to close the hole in Ms Saville's heart during a keyhole procedure but it failed so she had to have open-heart surgery which involved breaking her sternum

After the surgery, Ms Saville had to sleep sitting up for five weeks and she has to spend six months recovering before returning to Zuma

But in order to operate on her successfully, doctors had to break her sternum.

This involved making an incision in her abdomen and disjointing the ribs behind her chest.

To close the wound, medics inserted metal wires to pull Ms Saville’s chest back together, for her bone to grow around and heal.

She said: 'When I woke up, I must have just twitched a tiny amount and the whole top half of my body was in agony.

Ms Saville said: 'When I woke up, I must have just twitched a tiny amount and the whole top half of my body was in agony. There was a searing pain across my chest and it took my breath away'

'There was a searing pain across my chest and it took my breath away. Just the slightest movement made everything hurt.

'I had to be washed, dressed, showered, and even have my teeth brushed and walking was particularly difficult.

'I couldn’t walk and my arms hanging down by my side was incredibly painful.'

As well as being forced to sleep sitting upright for the first five weeks, Ms Saville then faced a six-month recovery period, before she could get back to her active self.

She said: 'I had to be washed, dressed, showered, and even have my teeth brushed and walking was particularly difficult. I couldn't walk and my arms handing down by my side was incredibly painful'

She said: 'It was really hard 
stopping my fitness. It was going really well before I found out about 
the hole in my heart and I was developing a client base who I didn’t 
want to let down.

'Everything
stopped and came to a standstill. I was just trying to establish myself
when I had to wait until I was better to carry on.'

She
added: 'I didn’t talk about it much while I was ill. It would have been
really easy to just mope about and I wanted to stay as positive as 
possible.

To correct the hole in Ms Saville's heart, surgeons had to open up her chest and separate her sternum

'When you’re told something like that you have to stay strong for self-preservation.

'It
was really hard being in a hospital surrounded by elderly patients but I
knew I needed the operation, even though I am so young.'

Ms
Saville’s heart condition was not picked up on while she was a baby, 
she and her parents Sandra and Andrew Saville, have since discovered 
that a simple test could have been done.

Mrs Saville, 51, said: 'Nicole’s 
condition wasn’t picked up when she was born because the hole was so 
small and wasn’t causing her obvious symptoms.

'But
now I think back to things that were unexplained and now they make 
sense. I just didn’t want to over-react and panic over the smallest of 
things.

'It’s such a cheap test and most parents would pay out of their own pockets just to be sure if they knew it could potentially save their child in the future.

'It should be something that is checked as standard.'

Despite still getting aches and pains, Ms Saville is now back to her active self and she is looking forward to a successful life as a Zumba instructor with the support of fiancé Oliver Horne.

She said: 'My family and Oliver have been so supportive throughout everything and been there for me through all the bad times when I wasn’t feeling myself.

'This is something that is associated with people in their 70s and 80s but people need to realise that it happens to young people like me as well.'

Ms Saville (pictured with her fiancé, Oliver) is now hoping to return to work as a Zumba instructor. She also hopes to raise awareness about holes in the heart so people realise they can happen to anyone

Ms Saville is hoping to raise 
awareness of her experience to help other young adults who may suffer 
with a hole in their heart that is not detected until later in life.

She
has so far raised £500 for Take Heart, a Yorkshire-based charity which 
aims to help patients suffering from heart conditions and offers support
to their relatives.

He
mother added: 'Take Heart gave me a room next door to where Nicole was 
in the hospital with a bed and a shower. It was all free and it was 
fantastic because I could just be there for her the whole time.'

Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'If there is something wrong with a baby’s heart at birth they are said to have congenital heart disease.

Ms Saville said: 'It was really hard stopping my fitness. It was going really well before I found out about the hole in my heart and I was developing a client base who I didn't want to let down'

'There are many types of congenital heart disease and "hole in the heart" is a rare defect in the wall between two of the heart’s chambers.

'Some congenital heart problems are now picked up during pregnancy but sometimes they’re not found until the baby has been born.

'Some conditions may not be discovered until the child is an adult, although a hole in the heart is more commonly spotted in childhood.

'It’s vitally important a hole in the heart is picked up as early as possible so children can be monitored and get the right treatment, which is normally heart surgery. If you want more information about congenital heart disease, call our Heart Helpline on 0300 330 3311.'

Holes in the heart are congenital heart defects which change the normal flow of blood through the heart.

The hole is usually found in the wall between the two different sides of the heart - the septum.

About eight in every 1,000 babies have a hole in the heart.

Symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, a build up of fluid in the lungs and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs and abdomen.

If the hole is not closed, it can cause heart failure or stroke.

Whether treatment is required depends on the severity of the problem - some people never require treatment for the hole in their heart.

If the hole is large, surgery if often required to close it.
