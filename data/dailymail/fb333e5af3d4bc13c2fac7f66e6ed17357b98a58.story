It is expected that Packer will Join Crowe at the Rabbitohs next year

Billionaire James Packer  is reportedly close to signing a major, multi-million deal to buy-out Peter Holmes a Court's share of the South Sydney Rabbitohs and  join Russell Crowe as co-owner of the club.

Negotiations between the parties are being finalised more than a year after they began, but have been kept silent in the hope that they would not disrupt the NRL club's tilt at a drought-breaking premiership.

But now, two days after the Rabbitohs broke their 43-year losing streak by winning Sunday's Grand Final, it is understood Packer is poised to pounce on a 37 per cent share in the club still owned by Holmes a Court.

Packer, whose father Kerry was a Rabbitohs supporter, has described the Rabbitohs as one of the world's greatest sports brands and was considered a leading contender to join  Crowe at  after rumours surfaced that Holmes a Court was looking to exit.

While Crowe had pledged his ongoing commitment to the ­Rabbitohs, Holmes a Court had remained tight-lipped on his plans in terms of future ownership. 

­Speculation was rife that James Packer — whose company Crown Resorts is the club’s major sponsor — wanted to buy Holmes a Court’s stake in the Rabbitohs because his interest had waned since moving overseas.

Now the Daily Telegraph has reported that a deal is close to being hatched following the Bunny's victory on Sunday.

If the deal is announced it would mean both Packer and Crowe would hold a joint 75 per cent share in the club, while its members would hold on to the remaining 25 per cent.

Packer is a lifelong Sydney Roosters fan, although his late father Kerry supported Souths. 

Mr Holmes a Court worked with Crowe during his eight-year rein at South Sydney to build the club up from cellar  dwellers to NRL champions. 

Now based overseas Holmes a Court is proud of what he has achieved and believes now is the right time to sell his stake as it is difficult for him to keep a vested interest from afar.

Before the pair made a bid to buy the club in 2006, the Rabittohs were in financial ruin and it was widely reported that the pair helped salvage them from disaster.

Since that time, both have been forced to inject further funds into the club, although in recent years that has no longer been required. It is now reported that the club is valued at around $20 million.

On Sunday South Sydney won its 21st premiership on  and its first since 1971 when they claimed the NRL's most coveted prize by defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 26-6.
