Nelson Mandela began responding better to treatment this morning for a recurring lung infection following 'a difficult last few days', South Africa's president said.

Jacob Zuma told parliament that he is happy with the progress that the 94-year-old is making following his hospitalisation on Saturday.

Mr Mandela spent a fifth straight day in a Pretoria hospital, where he was visited by one of his daughters and two granddaughters.

Mr Zuma noted that today marked the 49th anniversary of the sentencing of the former president to life in prison in 1964.

He said 'our thoughts' are with Mandela and his family 'on this crucial historical anniversary'.

'We are very happy with the progress that he is now making following a difficult last few days,' Mr Zuma said.

'We appreciate the messages of support from all over the world.'

Mr Zuma also applauded the legacy of Mr Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists today.

South Africa's government disbanded its official policy of apartheid - racial segregation and discrimination - in 1994.

'Our country is a much better place to live in now than it was before 1994, even though we still have so much work to do,' Mr Zuma said.

He added the former president is 'a good fighter' and was confident doctors were doing a 'very good job' looking after him.

Referring to Mr Mandela as 'the father of democracy in South Africa', he said: 'We need him to be with us and I'm sure all the messages that have been pouring in to wish him a speedy recovery are highly welcome.'

He said he had been given a 'thorough briefing' by Mr Mandela's doctors, according to the BBC.

Speaking
during a TV interview last night, the ANC leader added: 'Whilst he is 
very serious, he is stabilised and we are all praying for him, really, 
to recuperate quickly. We need him to go with us.'

President Zuma also plans to visit the anti-apartheid hero 'as soon as his diary allows', a government spokesman told local radio this morning, adding that Mr Mandela remained in a 'serious but stable' condition.

Mandela, who turn 95 next month, is being treated at a Pretoria hospital for a recurring lung infection.

The
hospital stay is his fourth since December and there is a growing 
realisation among South Africa's 53million people that they will one day
have to say goodbye to the father of the 'Rainbow Nation' that Mandela 
tried to forge from the ashes of apartheid.

Yesterday, his family including ex-wife Winnie gathered at his bedside.

Winnie
Mandela, 76, who was married to Mr Mandela for almost 40 years between 
1957 and 1996, spent around an hour with her ex-husband.

One of their daughters Zindziwa, 52, 
has also visited him in intensive care. She told the South African 
Guardian: 'I’ve seen my father and he’s well. He’s a fighter.'

Their other daughter Zenani, 53, has 
flown home from Argentina, where she is South Africa’s ambassador, to be
at his bedside along with his third wife Graca Machel and other family 
members. 

President Jacob Zuma was seen placing a hand on Mr Mandela's following his release from hospital in April

Graca, who accompanied him to hospital on 
Saturday, cancelled a scheduled appearance in London so she could stay 
with her husband.

The family of the iconic 
former leader denied barring government officials and high-ranking 
members of the ANC from his bedside, a government spokesman said.  

'We have spoken to the family about 
this report and they deny that they issued such an instruction or spoke 
to the media on barring the ANC and government from visiting Madiba,' 
said spokesperson Jackson Mthembu in a statement.

'What we know is that given the 
pressure associated with the admission of president Mandela, there are 
general restrictions that permit only relevant people to have access.'

A foundation led by retired
archbishop Desmond Tutu has described Mr Mandela as an 'extraordinary gift' to South Africa.

Mr Mandela 'once again endures the 
ravages of time in hospital,' said the Cape Town-based foundation, which
was founded by Mr Tutu and his wife Leah to promote peace.

'We offer our thanks to God for the extraordinary gift of Mr Mandela, and wish his family strength.'

Mr Tutu, 81, was also a vigorous 
campaigner against apartheid, which ended when all-race elections were 
held in 1994.

Like Mr Mandela, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 
his efforts on behalf of his compatriots. Mr Mandela shared his prize 
with FW de Klerk, the last president of the apartheid era.

'We send our blessings to the doctors and nurses responsible for his care,' the foundation said.

Nelson Mandela and his former wife Winnie walked hand-in-hand following his release from Victor Verster Prison near Cape Town in February 1990

Mr Mandela has been particularly 
vulnerable to respiratory problems since contracting tuberculosis during
27 years as a prisoner of the white South African government.

The
bulk of that period was spent on Robben Island, off the coast of Cape 
Town where Mandela and other prisoners spent part of the time toiling in
a stone quarry.

Mandela was freed in 1990 and won election to the presidency in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.

He was seen by many around the world 
as a symbol of resolve and reconciliation for his sacrifice in 
confinement as well as his peacemaking efforts during the tense 
transition that saw the demise of the apartheid system.

The
former leader retired from public life years ago and had received 
medical care at home in Johannesburg until his latest transfer to a 
hospital.
