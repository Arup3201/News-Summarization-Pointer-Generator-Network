Britain is the first choice for young Romanians who want to work abroad – sparking concerns that hundreds of thousands could flock here when border controls  are scrapped.

Research has revealed a quarter of the population aged between 18 and 35 would choose a job in the UK when work restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians are removed on January 1.

The study found that Britain had overtaken Germany as the most  popular destination for young Romanians wanting to emigrate.

A Romanian think-tank suggests that 720,000 people could head to the UK when restrictions are lifted

The findings challenge a bid by 
ministers to play down the prospect of another influx from Eastern 
Europe when the immigrants are given free access to the UK jobs market.

The Government has made no attempt to estimate the number of Romanians 
and Bulgarians who will arrive here, but David Cameron insists there 
will be ‘nothing like’ the huge numbers seen when Poland joined the EU 
in 2004 – put at 1.1million.

However, a poll by the Romanian think-tank Ires suggests that as many as
 720,000 people could head to the UK when restrictions on employment are
 lifted.

Some 26 per cent of those who said they would be ‘very interested’ in working abroad named Britain as their first choice.

In total, the study found that 11 per cent of adults expressed an 
interest in finding a job here. The figure rose to 24 per cent for those
 aged 18 to 35.

The report was handed to MPs on the Commons home affairs select 
committee while they visited the Romanian capital Bucharest.

Swiss voters have overwhelmingly backed plans to restrict the number of people coming to live in the country.

Almost 80 per cent of voters approved the proposals, which gives the government greater control over housing immigrants.

It also stops asylum requests at Swiss embassies around the world and scraps providing sanctuary to conscientious objectors who are facing military service.

Celine Amandruz, of the Right-wing Swiss People’s Party, said the result proved there was ‘a need to change this system’.

Last month, Switzerland also placed a limit on the number of EU citizens – including Britons – who can work in the country.

James 
Clappison, a Tory MP on the committee, said: ‘There is no doubt that if 
they came, the young Romanians will be hard-working, talented and, in 
the main, self-sufficient – but they would add to pressure on housing 
and infrastructure, especially in the South-East.

‘It is impossible to predict with certainty but you have to plan on the 
basis of what might happen and there is evidence that this migration 
could happen.’

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of immigration think-tank MigrationWatch UK, 
said: ‘This is part of growing evidence of quite large numbers of 
Romanians and Bulgarians considering migrating to Britain to work.

‘The Government must impose a delay before granting access to our 
welfare system so they don’t have that extra incentive to come here.’

MigrationWatch UK estimated up to 75,000 migrants a year could arrive.
