Holidaymakers are to be hit with bills for hundreds of pounds under European Union plans to impose MoT-style tests on caravans.

Up to 200,000 families could be affected by the draconian demands which it is warned could devastate the UK’s tourism economy.

The UK government is to launch an attempt to block the regulations, but it is feared it will be passed into law by Brussels later this year.

Testing: Up to 200,000 caravans face annual MoT-style tests to see if they are roadworthy under EU plans

Under the new rules almost every caravan will have to undergo safety testing, similar to MoTs for cars.

Controversially, all other light trailers under 2000kg will remain excluded from testing and only caravans have been singled out.

German MEP Werner Kuhn, a member of the transport committee pushing the reforms, argued that regular checks are needed on caravans which can often be left 'in a barn and used only once a year'.

He added: 'Then the chicken feathers are swept away and you do not know if the brakes are still OK, if the lighting works.'

But the Caravan Club, which has 375,000 members across the UK, argues that families towing and staying in caravans, often with young children, are more likely to have it serviced regularly to ensure it is safe.

A spokesman said: ‘The Caravan Club actively supports and encourages measures designed to improve road safety, but has seen no EU evidence that MOT-style testing on caravans will do so.

‘Caravanning is inherently very safe, with extremely low levels of reported accidents, and the overwhelming majority of accidents which do occur are caused by factors such as poor loading  - causing instability - and driver behaviour, not by factors that would be mitigated by roadworthiness testing.’

End of the road? Campaigners warn the charges could force families to give up a past time which has been popular since the 1960s

The Club warns that M-T-style testing
 for caravans could act as a ‘significant financial barrier’ to families
 being able to afford to keep a caravan and go on holiday.

‘This
 will in turn have a detrimental effect on the UK's tourism economy, and
 economy in general, if the number of caravanners reduces as a result of
 the cost of caravanning increasing.

‘Club members alone, annually spend £40 million with local businesses, when on their caravanning trips,’ the spokesman added.

An earlier EU plan to impose testing 
on small trailers including caravans was rejected by government 
ministers from governments across the continent at a meeting in December
 last year.

Criticism: UKIP MEP Derek Clark said the rules were unnecessary

But the testing regulations have been resurrected, and will be debated in the European Parliament this autumn.

Transport minister Earl Attlee said: ‘The Government’s intention is to continue to oppose such a measure.

‘We do not yet have a developed assessment of the costs and benefits of this specific measure but we estimate that it could require around 200,000 tests on caravans per year.’

UKIP MEP Derek Clark said: ‘It is the EU again going right over the top with petty rules and regulations.

‘It
 is totally unnecessary. Caravanners keep their caravan in good order.

'Caravanners as a whole are very sensible and caring people. They are not
 going to risk their holiday, still less their lives with a dodgy 
caravan.

'If it is a couple of hundreds pounds, that's the cost of several weekends away.'

The plans passed their first stage in the European Parliament on July 2, after British MEPs spoke out against the idea.

Tory MEP Jacqueline Foster said: 'There is no evidence to suggest that the inclusion of caravans – a £6billion pound industry in the UK – and light commercial trailers would benefit from a road safety angle.

'We should be encouraging our leisure and tourism industries, not penalising them.'

The European Commission refused to comment.
