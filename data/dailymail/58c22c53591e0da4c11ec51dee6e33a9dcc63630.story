A new ‘wonder’ drug which increases survival from the most dangerous form of skin cancer must be withheld until patients have undergone chemotherapy, says the NHS rationing watchdog.

Ipilimumab increases lifespan by an average of four months in patients with malignant melanoma where the cancer has spread to other organs.

But trial data shows more than one in five patients lives for at least three years after treatment.

It is estimated the drug can help between 1,000 and 2,000 patients in the UK each year, many of them in their 20s and 30s.

Ipilimumab, also known as Yervoy, is used to treat advanced melanoma. But NHS patients can only get access to it once they have undergone chemotherapy

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) admits the drug is ‘life-extending’ and has already approved its use after chemotherapy.

But a new licence means the drug could be used earlier, before patients have to suffer debilitating side effects from chemo such as hair loss.

However, Nice says ipilimumab should not be available for patients at this first line stage, only if they take part in clinical trials.

The decision has alarmed doctors and campaigners, particularly as the Cancer Drugs Fund says the change would be cost neutral - adding nothing to the NHS bill.

More than 10,400 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma each year and 2,000 people die. It is the most common kind of cancer for women in their 20s

Patients in the U.S. have been able to use the drug immediately they are diagnosed with advanced disease for the last three years because the authorities recognised the benefit.

Gill Nuttall, of the charity Melanoma UK, said: 'Advanced melanoma is a devastating diagnosis, yet treatment options remain severely limited for many patients facing this disease.

‘Unless reversed, this decision by Nice will sadly continue this trend and will leave some patients without a medicine that could potentially help extend their lives.’

Around 12,800 Britons are diagnosed each year with melanoma, of which 2,200 die.

Manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb says the therapy - which stimulates the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer - has the potential to offer long-term survival to some.

Treatment costs around £63,000, less an undisclosed discount to the NHS.

Guidance issued by Nice in December 2012, gave the go-ahead for use of the drug, also known as Yervoy, on the NHS for advanced malignant melanoma patients who have already undergone chemotherapy.

At the time, Nice called the drug a ‘breakthrough treatment’ saying that it could ‘potentially significantly improve the prognosis for some people with malignant melanoma'.

Last year, European health officials extended the licence of the drug so it could also be used in previously untreated patients - not just those who had undergone chemotherapy.

But Nice says the manufacturer has not provided enough evidence to show the drug as a first-line treatment can extend the lives of patients.
