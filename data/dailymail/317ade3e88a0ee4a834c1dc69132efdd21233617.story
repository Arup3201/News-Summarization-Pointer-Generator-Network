A dedicated gardener has spent a quarter of a century turning his 'blank canvas' of a garden into an exotic jungle.

Tim Wilmot, who runs a software firm, has spent £10,000 and 25 years of his life transforming the back of his suburban Bristol property into a lush paradise of foliage.

It boasts more than 80 species of plants, including bamboo, banana trees and palms hailing from as far as South Africa.

Unlikely location: Tim Wilmot's home in Bristol is actually home to more than 80 species of tropical plant

Extensive: Much of the garden, pictured in the height of summer, is packed away in colder months

Mr Wilmot, 56, spends between three and four hours a week in the garden, helping the plants to grow in the colder British weather.

He said: 'When I first bought the house the garden was a blank canvas - it was just a lawn with a few old trees but now it completely been transformed and it's totally exotic.

'In my previous house I had the ambition to transform it but I just didn't have the space.

'I've always wanted to create my own little paradise, and I've spent 25 years doing it. I've got about half a dozen palm trees, all of which are hardened to survive in the UK.

There's also a number of different bamboo plants and some ferns.

'There are a few banana plants that flower and produce fruit every few years. Obviously it is difficult in the UK so you have to have a hot summer followed by a mild winter.

'The rest of the family have to suffer! They aren't big gardeners but they have to put up with what I've done to it, but actually they really like it and they love spending time in it.'

Tim, who lives in a modern detached house with his wife Sheila, 60, and their two children, brought the property in 1989 and decided to turn the empty garden into a vibrant jungle.

He began planting a number of different palm trees in the garden, all of which are hardened to survive the colder climates of the UK.

His impressive collection of plants include a variety of different bamboos, ferns, ornamental cacti and even banana trees.

He also grows a number of unique Yuccas, as well as succulents such as Puya alpestris, a member of the pineapple family, and rice paper plants.

Maintaining the garden takes around three to four hours a week, with an extreme watering regime in the summer and construction in the winter.

In winter months Mr Wilmot, a father of two, builds shelters to protect the plants, enabling them to survive the cold temperatures.

He said: 'In the summer the majority of my time is spent water the plants, that's all you have to do to maintain them.

'It's a bit different in the winter, I spend quite a few weekends working, constructing shelters over plants and making DIY poly-tunnels.

'I also buy about ten bales of straw which needs to be scattered around some of the more vulnerable plants to protect them from the wet, cold weather.

'Then when it gets to spring I have to allocate time to do the reverse process - taking off all the covers.

'This is normally a good few hours a week worth of work. I probably spend a little longer than your average gardener in the back garden.

'The biggest thing for me now is pruning - just making sure things don't get out of control.'.

Humble roots: Mr Wilmot's gardening ambitions began with a few humble palm trees, but became more audacious over time

 labour: Mr Wilmot (pictured next to a Chilean puya plant), a

Mr Wilmot said the £10,000 cost of his paradise was made up of  composts, fertilisers, and materials to build his shelters - as well as the plants themselves.

He said: 'I would say I've probably spent about £10,000 on the garden all things considered.

'When you think about it I don't think that's too bad though. I think you can justify spending that on a hobby.'

Every year Mr Wilmot opens up his garden under the National Garden Scheme raising funds for charity.

He has also won a number of accolades for his paradise, including runner-up spot in The Times's back garden of the year competition in 2004.

Mr Wilmot's garden will next be open to the public on Saturday 14 September.

Mr Wilmot's dazzling array of flora which have adorned his garden over the years number in the dozens and hail from all over the world. Here are a selection of the most exotic:

Juania australis: Known as the Chonta Pine, this endangered palm tree is native to West Chile.

Beschorneria yuccoides: This pink, flowering tree is hails from the mountains of Mexico

Tetrapanax papyrifer: The so-called Rice Paper Plant has huge leaves and is found in Taiwan.

Ophiopogon japonicus: Also known as monkey grass, this plant is found mainly in Japan. 

Musa sikkimensis: Also known as the Darjeeling banana, this plant is native to Bhutan and India.

Yucca gloriosa: Often called the Spanish Dagger, this flowering plant is from the eastern U.S.
