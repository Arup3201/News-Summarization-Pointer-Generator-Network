In the wake of the Baby Gammy scandal and a string of similar cases, the Thai government has passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services.

The law, which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term, aims to stop Thailand from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples.

It comes after a several scandals involving Australian citizens this year, including the infamous Baby Gammy saga and the tandem threat it sparked for a Victorian couple, who almost lost triplet girls they arranged through a surrogate.

National Legislative Assembly member Wanlop Tangkananurak said the new laws are intended to evade such recent incidents.

'Surrogacy business leaves too much long-term trouble for Thailand, so we are banning foreign couples from seeking surrogacy in our country to avoid being a hub and to prevent what we saw last year,' Wanlop said.

The parliament voted 160 to 2 to pass the law Thursday night.

Under the new law, a Thai couple is allowed to seek a surrogate to carry the fetus only if they are able to prove that they and their relatives are infertile.

It also says that anyone involved in commercial surrogacy will face a maximum jail term of 10 years and a maximum fine of 200,000 baht ($6,100).

Thailand was one of the few countries in Asia where commercial surrogacy was not specifically banned by law.

There was however a regulation stating that doctors risk losing their license if they perform surrogacy for pay.

Thailand became a go-to destination for couples from Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan and a low-cost alternative to the United States.

But this led to a string of scandals. In July 2014, a West Australian couple were accused abandoning an infant known as Baby Gammy, leaving him with with his surrogate mother learning he had Down Syndrome.

Thai surrogate Pattaramon Chanbua alleged Wendy and David Farnell-the latter being a convicted child sex offender-left Gammy and returned to Western Australia with his healthy twin sister, Pipah.

Two Victorian men, Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were terrified the scandal would mean they may never get to see the faces of their unborn triplets.

As the news broke around the world, Thai surrogate agencies went into lockdown, disconnecting their phones and shutting off email connections.

The Gammy saga cast a controversial light on the largely unregulated business of commercial surrogacy

But Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop stepped in, negotiating with the Thai military to allow the couple caeess to the country and their children.

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs estimated that 50 Thai surrogate mothers are expected to carry babies for Australian couples by the end of 2015.

There is currently a changeover period being debated to enable the children and their Australian parents to depart Thailand.
