What could be more heartwarming than a picture of one of the world’s most eligible bachelors doting over the lady carrying his child?

Perhaps a whole series of them?

For over the past week, the public has been treated to a host of pictures documenting Simon Cowell’s blossoming romance with Lauren Silverman, the U.S. socialite who is three months pregnant.

Steady on girl, you'll swallow him whole! As Simon grips the sides of his public sun lounger on the beach at  St Tropez in apparent panic, Lauren pins him down for another smooch. But why go to the beach when you have a private yacht in the bay? CRINGE FACTOR: 8/10

Still on the beach, it’s the 'lovers strolling through the surf picture', always a classic. But they need to work on hand-holding - Simon seems to be just clutching on to her pinkie. CRINGE FACTOR: 8/10

What better way to be seen in St Tropez than taking a spin along the seafront in an exotic open top sports car? The only problem with choosing a classic Porsche of the type favoured by James Dean is that it will turn more heads than you do. A poor choice. CRINGE FACTOR: 2/10

Somehow, photographers always seem to know exactly where to find the couple. And, gosh, aren’t they obliging when they are found? Holding hands, strolling through the surf and, most peculiarly, kissing at an outdoor table of Cafe Rouge — an oddly public place to go when you are worth £220 million and could take your pick of London’s secluded restaurants.

But it’s clear the usually private Cowell, 53, has never been keener to be pictured. Apparently he is so nervous about the negative publicity surrounding his affair with Lauren — who was married to Cowell’s friend, real estate tycoon Andrew Silverman, when she became pregnant — that he’s desperate to show the world how in love they are. 

Lauren puts on another show at an outdoor cafe in St Tropez. But Simon has the body language of an embarrassed man. CRINGE FACTOR: 8/10

Later they look indulgently at a cute little girl. The intended message? That they'll make fabulous parents in February. CRINGE FACTOR: 10/10

Simon and Lauren board a private jet to London from Nice. There is a lovely view here of their matching bumps. Both look suitably glossy and masters of the universe-ish. CRINGE FACTOR: 2/10

Leaving his London house on his way to Harley Street - whether for Botox, or baby, it is hard to say. What the Churchill sign means is anyone's guess. CRINGE FACTOR: 1/10

To the Cafe Rouge in Mayfair. Everything about Cowell's straight-backed posture and nonchalant chin-in-hand pose says 'act natural' - yet the effect is quite the opposite. CRINGE FACTOR: 10/10

Still hungry? They arrive later at Scalini's restaurant in Chelsea. Simon looks a little distracted as Lauren plants a peck on his cheek. CRINGE FACTOR: 2/10

A source close to Cowell tells me: ‘He was appalled by the reaction to the initial story, that he had run off with his best friend’s wife.

‘It made him look a right nasty b******. He has been advised to keep it as quiet as he possibly can, but she was pressing to come out and see him. Simon is hoping that people will see it as a love story, and wish him luck.’

Yet his seemingly staged Public Displays of Affection may have backfired. Critics online have declared them ‘shameless’, ‘so contrived,’ and ‘cringey’.

Picture research: CLAIRE CISOTTI

In the company of not-very-publicity-shy Louis Walsh, Simon and Lauren are certainly getting the hang of this thing for Public Displays of Affection. She has a lovely smile and a pretty pink dress, but their bodies remain as stiff as a couple of mannequins in a shop window. CRINGE FACTOR: 9/10 

Simon is showing off even more cleavage than her in a shirt open to the waist. This clinch ought to be intimate at the end of a romantic evening, but it is simply unconvincing. CRINGE FACTOR: 9/10

A classic in-car shot, with Lauren looking radiant but clingy and Simon a picture of smug satisfaction. He permitted a lot of these kind of shots to be taken when he was with his now-discarded fiancee Mezhgan Hussainy, too. And, another thing: Scalini's is a favourite restaurant of Simon's PR guru Max Clifford. CRINGE FACTOR: 8/10
