Are you an hourglass like Kelly Brook or rectangle-shaped like Nicole Kidman?

You may think you have finally managed to figure out which body shape you are. But think again. It's time to get back to the drawing board because a new way of categorising your figure is about to land.

The women of South Korea are using ‘Alphabetisation’, or matching their bodies with certain letters, to identify their shape.

So which is which and what shape does everyone want to be? FEMAIL break them down one by one.

The most desirable is the S-line, a body shape with ample breasts and buttocks when viewed from the side.

Korean singer and actress Son Dam Bi is well-known for her S-line body. In Western culture, Kim Kardashian - who often tops polls for having the sexiest body - is the perfect example of the S-line.

The V-line - a slim and oval face narrowing towards the chin - is another coveted shape. The entire concept behind it is so your face looks smaller, which is considered beautiful in South Korea.

Korean women and models often pose with their fists or peace-sign hands in front of their faces, to create this illusion; Nicole Kidman has a V-line face shape.

There is also the X-line, is basically exactly how the letter looks: long legs and arms connected by a narrow waist.

Picture the meeting point of the two lines is the waist and there you have it - or look to supermodel Cara Delevingne who possessed this athletic body shape.

In South Korea, the X-line is sought after by younger women in high school or college.

The U-line, which outlines the shape of a woman’s back when she wears a low-cut dress, was showcased to perfection by Emma Watson in her questionable Golden Globes dress.

The look is considered a daring and sexy one and can be accentuated by low-cut backless dresses a la Miss Watson.

D­-line denotes a pregnant, or pregnant-looking, stomach.

B-line means a big bust and stomach. Nigella Lawson is a rather busty lady.

The O-line, which stands for obese, is the least desired body shape amongst South Koreans. Josie Gibson weighed in at 19 stone before her incredible weight loss, classing her as obese.

Alphabetisation is mainly reserved for women but men can be categorised as M-line for having a six-pack.

The alphabet code is big business in South Korean culture and singers and actresses often refer to their body lines.

The differing body lines also feature on beauty products, drinks, lingerie, music and diet supplements.

'Some of these ads insist that whatever product they’re selling will help you obtain the desired contour; others (like the beer ad) just traffic in the allure of the letter to make their product seem cool,' writes Katy Waldman on Slate.com.

So where did the bizarre trend begin? It has been claimed that a weight-loss drink used the X waist in its marketing campaign in 2008 and it has taken off ever since.

And judging by recent figures which revealed that South Koreans have more plastic surgery than any other nation, it's hardly surprising that they're such a self-conscious nation.

Those in the Asian country have more treatments per members of the population, with 
one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle.

The figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks.

While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is in fact booming.

Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife.

One of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper 
eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more 'Western'.

It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes.
