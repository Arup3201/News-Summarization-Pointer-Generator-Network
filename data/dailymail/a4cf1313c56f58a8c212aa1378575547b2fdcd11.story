Former Chancellor Lord Lawson has dismissed David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels - and suggested he may have to call for the UK to leave.

The Conservative peer warned that the Prime Minister would have to consult – and ‘persuade overwhelmingly’ - Tory MPs before deciding whether to recommend an In or an Out vote in a future EU referendum

He added that the ‘logic’ of the PM’s position was that if he can’t get ‘major changes’ in the EU, the UK will have to leave. Lord Lawson also predicted that Mr Cameron would get ‘nothing of any significance’ from the EU.

Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson said David Cameron would not be able to win back anything substantial from Brussels and may have to recommend withdrawing from the EU

The comments, in an interview to The House magazine, come after the new EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker dismissed the notion of restricting Eastern European immigration to the UK.

The former Luxembourg leader said 'freedom of movement' within the EU was not up for negotiation.

Mr Juncker, the nominee to be the next European Commission president, met MEPs from Nigel Farage's eurosceptic group in the European Parliament ahead of his coronation next week.

He was asked directly if he would support any restrictions on free movement of workers within the EU. According to UKIP MEPs at the meeting, he replied: 'No.'

Mr Juncker also raised the prospect of 'harmonising' tax rates - which would be fiercely resisted in Westminster.

In light of Mr Juncker's intervention, Lord Lawson's remarks will pile pressure on the Prime Minister to reveal what powers he wants to see returned to Westminster.

Lord Lawson said he was 'convinced' that Mr Cameron would not be able to win anything back from Brussels of any worth.

He said: 'I may be wrong, but from my knowledge of the European Union - that nothing of any significance is negotiable.

'Not least because anything of significance requires treaty changes and treaty changes have to be agreed unanimously so it’s no good just getting one or two countries onside, so I don’t think it’s on. But we shall see.'

David Cameron has vowed to win back powers from Brussels before putting Britain's membership of the EU to an in-out referendum in 2017

He was also asked what the PM should do if Tory MPs were unhappy with whatever deal he gets from Brussels ahead of any 2017 EU referendum. Lord Lawson said: 'I think he will take that into account.'

The Tory peer added: 'Although as of now his position is that he’s firmly committed to recommending an ‘In’ vote - he’s a great optimist and he thinks he can negotiate all these changes - but I think he will have to reconsider his position in the light of what he is able to secure.

'He will know too that he has either got to persuade the Parliamentary party overwhelmingly (there will always be dissent)…or else he’s got to reconsider his own position on this issue.

'Because the logic of his position is clear. He has said the European Union as it exists at present is seriously unsatisfactory, therefore some major changes need to be made.

'The logic of that position is that if you don’t secure these major changes, you leave the European Union. Not in any hostile frame of mind. As you know I live in France and I have nothing against Europe as such.

'But you just have to say it is not in Britain’s interest to remain there. And of course it is made all the more likely by the creation of the eurozone and they are also changing the qualified majority voting rules.

'We will find ourselves outside the eurozone…our influence on European Union law is bound to be less than it has in the past. There will be a solid eurozone bloc vote. If we oppose anything we will be overridden.”

Nigel Farage held talks on Wednesday with the proposed new head of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker

Asked if he envisages the PM consulting the Parliamentary party on the In-Out decision in 2017, just as it appears the 1922 Committee will be consulted in 2015 in the event of any plans for another Coalition, he said: 'I think you’re right to draw parallels between the two. I think he will. Whether he does it through formal consultation or informally, I think he will need to do that.'

Lord Lawson also said it would be ‘excellent’ for the Tories if Boris Johnson was to return to Parliament and called on the Tories to form a minority government if there is a hung Parliament
