Te'o also said that he did not make up anything to help his Heisman Trophy chances.

'When (people) hear the facts, they'll know,' he said. 'They'll know that there is no way that I could be part of this.'

Te'o spoke to ESPN at the IMG Training Academy in Bradenton, Fla., where he is 
preparing for the NFL draft.

ESPN also reoprts that Te'o lied to his father about having met Kekua, which explains why his father told reporters that the two had met.

Te'o told Schaap that tried to speak with Kekua via Skype and FaceTime several times, 'but the person at the other end of the line was in what he called a 'black box' and wasn't seen.'

Te'o even lied to his own father about meeting Kekau

In the late-night interview Friday, 
Te'o told Schaap he 'catered' his stories so people would think he 'met 
her before she passed away.

'I
knew that -- I even knew that it was crazy that I was with somebody 
that I didn't meet,' he said. 'And that alone people find out that this 
girl who died I was so invested in, and I didn't meet her as well.

Te'o clarified some things about the relationship with Lennay.

'My relationship with Lennay wasn't a four-year relationship,' Te'o said. 'There were blocks and times and periods in which we would talk and then it would end.'

Manti Te'o's 'dead girlfriend' Lennay Kekau was yesterday exposed as an elaborate hoax

Te'o told ESPN their relationship 
intensified after Kekua told him her father had died, with the two 
forming a 'spiritual connection.

'She told me her dad passed away, and
I was there. I was that shoulder to cry on. And I kind of just 
naturally cared for the person,' Te'o said. 'And so our relationship 
kind of took another level. But not the kind of exclusive level yet.'

Deadspin first reported on Wednesday that Lennay Kekua's existence was a hoax, allegedly played by Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, a family friend

And what should happen to Tuiasosopo?

'I
hope he learns,' Te'o said. 'I hope he understands what he's done. I 
don't wish an ill thing to somebody. I just hope he learns. I think 
embarrassment is big enough.'

Te’o’s 
online relationship with Kekua had been a major storyline throughout the 
college football season as Notre Dame went undefeated all the way to the
BSC championships before losing to Alabama.

The star 
linebacker had learned that Kekua, who was allegedly battling leukemia 
after a devastating car accident, died just hours after his beloved 
grandmother Annette Santiago passed away on September 12.

Notre Dame's 
coach even dedicated the game ball to Kekua after they beat Michigan, 
the game that sent them to the finals in Florida.
