Rihanna went some way towards placating the fans she kept waiting for more than three hours with a storming show in Monaco on Wednesday evening.

But it was a 
different story that evening, when she took to the stage in a racy white
tuxedo mini-dress by Balmain, and over-the-knee-satin boots to entertain guests at a private $782 per head dinner.

The
sleeveless dress was secured at the waist by two buttons, highlighting 
her toned frame as she did her best to atone for the late showing.

The Bajan star enraged fans in the 
French Principality by her late arrival at the Monte Carlo Sporting Club
& Casino, where she was booked to entertain the high-rolling 
audience.

Her smart stage-wear was completed by
a pleated detail while the string of green and red jewels around her 
neck glittered beneath the venue's lighting as she was joined by a 
troupe of black-clad dancers for an energetic set.

After arriving late and 
offering no explanation for her poor timekeeping, the songstress was 
clearly keen to put on a memorable show for guests who had paid as much 
as $782 to attend.

Rihanna arrived in France following a show in Austrian capital Vienna on 
Tuesday looking washed out as she crossed the airport terminal 
with her hoodie pulled over her head and a large towel draped across her
shoulders.

However hours later the singer appeared to be 
revitalized throughout the show, with her make-up - heavy foundation, 
eye-liner and a slash of blood red lipstick - giving her fresh looking 
appearance.

Towards the end of the performance an exhausted looking Rihanna was coated in a thin sheen of sweat, but her hair and make-up were still flawless as she exited the stage.

In a year that’s seen teenager Justin Bieber’s current tour dogged with controversy, Rihanna’s ambitious Diamond’s Tour has also received its fair share of criticism.

The Diamond’s singer was recently attacked by anti-drug campaigners for posting Instagram pictures in which she appears to be lighting two huge spliffs during her recent visit to Amsterdam.

She was also two hours late for a show at Birmingham’s LG Arena during the UK leg of her tour – during which she also lashed out at an over-zealous fan, also in Birmingham.

Earlier this month Rihanna reportedly ‘shocked’ fans in Poland whens she appeared to be ‘totally drunk and wasted during a Kings of Leon gig the Heineken Open’er Festival.

The incident came just 24-hours after fans booed her for another delayed show – this time at the Roskilde Music Festival in Denmark.

Despite appearing to please her Monaco fans, they vented their frustration while waiting for the singer to arrive earlier that evening.

'YOU'RE LATE BABY,' a fan with the handle @MorganeDK tweeted.

'Are you lost?' asked the same user, who also accused Rihanna of fan abuse.

Following another show in Monaco 
Rihanna’s tour will return to the UK, where she is scheduled to perform 
in Perth and Kinross, Manchester and Birmingham.
