Police were called to a pub’s beer garden after a squirrel climbed inside a woman’s handbag and refused to get out.

The woman, in her 30s, dialled 999 from the Shropshire Arms in Chester to say the squirrel ‘would not leave her alone’.

Detective Constable Nigel Thake, of Cheshire Constabulary, promptly arrived and managed to send the rodent on its way.

Writing about the incident on its official Twitter account, the force said: ‘Welcome to the varied day of a police officer’, and referred to DC Thake as ‘Dr Dolittle’. A police spokesman added: ‘The squirrel was released back into the wild.’

Local resident Tom Scott said: ‘I would have thought this was a case for the RSPCA rather than the police, but it just goes to show that the police are up for whatever gets thrown at them.’

Luckily, the animal in question was nowhere near Phil Warmlsey's pie shop Something Nice in Old Dalby, Leicestershire, where the 46-year-old businessman has developed a new range of squirrel pies.

He said: 'We started with kangaroo, crocodile, elk, buffalo and wagyu beef. We found a niche in the market. There are plenty of grey squirrels – they’re classified as vermin and it’s legal to kill them

'In a pie, it has similar characteristics to rabbit – it is a dark meat and very gamey. People come back for more because it has an excellent flavour – deep and rich.’

Squirrel was a popular dish in Victorian times and according to Mr Warmsley, customers love the exotic dish.

He sells the pies for £2.50 each.

He said: 'Killing more grey squirrels could give the red squirrel a chance to repopulate.

'You do get the odd person who asks how I can do this to such a lovely creature, but being at the top of the food chain we have the luxury of being able to eat what we want and they are vermin.'
