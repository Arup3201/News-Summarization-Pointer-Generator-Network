Delicate, feminine and utterly pretty, the new collection from Rochas epitomised grown up girlishness with its round-shouldered collarless printed coats and frothy gowns in sugar pink and pistachio.

It was the highlight of the second day in Paris, although Rochas' creative director Marco Zanini was run close by a strong showing from Dries van Noten.

The cerebral Belgian offered a masterclass in slouchy tailoring in minimalist shades of camel, white and grey, enlivened with quirky touches such as a gold peplum peeking from underneath a charcoal sweatshirt and print seemingly inspired by barbed wire.

Think pink! Rochas was awash with sugary hues and offered an unabashedly feminine silhouette

Clever: The Belgian made the most of knife pleats and ruffles

Elsewhere, Gareth Pugh showed a futuristic collection that wouldn't have looked out of place in Star Trek thanks to armour-inspired boxy shoulders and exaggerated collars, although the designer, who showed the collection at the Palais du Tokyo, insisted his vision was more oriental than out of this world.

Watching the silver sashay past was Amelie actress Audrey Tatou who appeared to enjoy what she was seeing, particularly the delicate bias cut dresses that proved Pugh hasn't lost his touch with tailoring.

Portuguese designer Felipe Oliveira Baptista offered a more conventional collection but a desirable one nonetheless, with long silk shirt dresses and neatly cropped trousers in a choice of navy blue, cobalt blue or (surprise!) sky blue.

Also on a mission to impress fashion fans was former Dior accessories designer Alexis Mabille, who showed a succession of knock-out dresses, including an incredible crystal belted gown in shimmering old gold silk worn with incongruous fringed cowboy boots.

Causing a fashion frenzy away from the catwalk was veteran Azzedine Alaia who unveiled a retrospective of his work at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, with Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley and Jason Statham in attendance.

Shown
in the Matisse room, the elaborate couture gowns were backdropped by 
some of the French Fauvist's greatest works including Lutte des Nymphes 
and Danse Inachevee.

The Tunisian-born couturier, meanwhile, offered a darkly glamorous greatest hits collection from seasons past complete with lashings of animal print and gowns featuring his trademark pleats.

Back on the runway, Paris' young designers were intent on proving that London doesn't have the monopoly on fresh talent.

Bringing Paris Fashion Week up to the current season was left to a raft of newcomers including Atsuro Tayama, Damir Doma, Julien David and Anthony Vaccarello.

Vacarello's show, a sultry blend of slick silk maxis with peekaboo cutouts and fluid separates, was enlivened by the presence of British model Alice Dellal front row.

The model and DJ sported a daringly short leather mini, a print crop top and a pair of black chunky boots, as well as her trademark undercut for her appearance in the French capital.

Christophe Lemaire delighted fashion fans with a composed collection that displayed his talent for tailoring off to maximum effect.

Highlights included a striking navy blue silk shirt dress enlivened with gently puffed sleeves and mannish wide-leg trousers in heavy cotton.

Croatian-German designer Damir Doma also took to the runway on day two, bent on proving why he is, according to German paper Bild, Germany's number three designer after Karl Lagerfeld and Jil Sander.

His stunningly simple collection 
combined a neat silhouette with delicate broderie anglaise and tulle 
before segueing into a tougher aesthetic courtesy of grey tweed and 
bright orange gabardine.

While
Doma made the lady his own, Julien David took a contrasting approach 
sending streetwear in bubblegum pink and khaki down the catwalk.

His sporty aesthetic was echoed by another rising star, Atsuro Tayama, who showed loosely structured dresses and neat separates in cool grey, white and petrol blue.

Off the catwalk, Scarlett Johansson, Paris Hilton and Hugh Jackman were both spotted shopping in Paris although neither have yet appeared front row.

With Lanvin, Carven and Roland Mouret all on the bill for today, that could be set to change.
