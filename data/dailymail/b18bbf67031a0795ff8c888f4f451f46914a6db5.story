China is to relax its controversial one-child policy because of concerns over slowing economic growth.

Couples will be allowed to have two  children if one parent is an only child, the state news agency Xinhua reported.

The policy was introduced in the late 1970s  to control the huge population, now the world’s largest at 1.4billion.

Exceptions already exist. Some cities allow a second child if both parents are only children, and rural families can also try for a second if their first born is a girl. Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs.

Long-term: China's one-child policy has been in place for decades

But many well-off families in the 
booming cities are willing to pay fines and the authorities have been 
known to turn a blind eye.

Although the deeply unpopular law - often 
brutally enforced through forced abortions - was effective at slowing an
unsustainable birth rate, it has led to a shortage of working-age 
people who can care for and fund the ageing population.

Communist 
leaders fear this imbalance could spark widespread social unrest and 
threaten the party’s  64-year grip on power.

The policy sparked a 
rise in infanticide of baby girls and illegal abortions of female 
foetuses because Chinese families want male heirs. It has also led to a 
huge gender imbalance with far more men than women.

Strict: China's one-child policy currently limits most urban couples to one child

Xinhua reported: 
‘The birth policy will be adjusted and improved step by step to promote 
long-term balanced development of the population in China.’

Professor 
Steve Tsang, from the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies at 
Nottingham University, said: ‘This move is primarily to deal with the 
demographic deficit, which has huge economic implications, particularly
over growth and stability.’

Other major reforms announced by China include abolishing labour camps to ‘improve human rights and judicial practices’.

It
is largely for petty offenders, but corrupt officials who want to 
punish whistleblowers and those who try to complain about them to higher
authorities abuse the system.
