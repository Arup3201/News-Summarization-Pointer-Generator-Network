Wendy Leigh (pictured) has struggled with the lack of affection shown to her by her father

Perched on the edge of my father’s deathbed during the last moments of his life, I hoped I could finally find some peace. After a lifetime where I’d felt anything but cherished by him, I thought this might be his moment to make amends for all those years of emotional neglect.

‘Is there anything you would like to say to me?’ I asked, pressing a notebook and pen into his hand as throat cancer had robbed him of his ability to speak.

My 75-year-old father, Paul, started scrawling onto the lined paper and I held my breath. Perhaps, after years of longing, this would be the moment when he would tell me how proud he was of me and how much he loved me.

Instead, when I read his final words, my heart sank. It wasn’t a message for me,  his 41-year-old daughter, but for his 27-year-old girlfriend of two years who lived  in Thailand. He wanted me to tell her that he loved her and would watch over her for ever.

I don’t know why I had expected anything different. Hurt as I was, I went downstairs to the telephone box, called my father’s girlfriend and relayed his last loving words to her.

Words which I had for my entire life longed for him to say to me.

Even at the end, my father refused to dole out any love or praise to me. His third cousin, the late artist Lucian Freud, once described himself as: ‘A selfish man who only does  what pleases me.’ My father was exactly the same.

It’s little wonder that Emma Thompson’s recent confession that her mother didn’t applaud her for her brilliant acting career, and only praised her once, really resonated with me.

Only in my case, it was my father, not my mother, who consistently refused to acknowledge any of  my virtues.

Like so many men born in the early 20th century, his inability to praise or encourage could have been a symptom of the post-war era in which tough love reigned supreme.

But I’m not about to defend  him. Growing up without a single word of praise from your father  is tough.

Until the age of six, I had been daddy’s girl, my father had doted on me, photographed me constantly, and, in his Viennese accent, dubbed me his ‘Pitzly’, German for ‘little thing’. But then I developed buck teeth and became fat and ungainly and, quite simply, my father lost interest in me.

Around the same time that Wendy's father (pictured) lost interest in her, he began having extra-marital affairs with an assortment of women and making a mockery of his marriage to Wendy's mother, Marion

It was around this time that he went off on his own adventures, having extra-marital affairs with an assortment of women and making a mockery of his marriage to my mother, Marion.

The import and export business he and my mother owned was doing well, so there was enough money to send me to drama school when I was nine years old.

When I bounced home every night, reciting reams of A Midsummer Night’s Dream by heart, my mother applauded enthusiastically while my father couldn’t have cared less. He watched, wordless, his face impassive.

Throughout my entire schooling, he never once came to speech day or my end-of-term play.When I started to blossom into womanhood, my mother was quick with the compliments. She told me what good skin I had, how pretty my eyes were, how glossy my hair was.

By now, after a 16-year marriage, my parents had divorced. My mother, though still in love with my father, could no longer grapple with the pain of his infidelity.

An inability to show love can be a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder

And while I still longed for his approval, I knew that the chances of getting it were remote and so I avoided him as much as possible, rarely spending time with him and his new wife, a blonde actress who was 25 to his 40.

On one of those rare occasions, out of the blue, he said: ‘Your stepmother has a better figure than you.’ Then, for good measure: ‘And your mother is prettier too.’

Why he would want to compare me to my mother or his second wife was utterly incomprehensible, but it cut through me like a knife.

He never recognised my professional successes, either. When, at 20, my first article was published, I proudly showed it to him, only for him to cast it aside with the words, ‘It’s good, but I could do better’.His comment stung then, and still resonates to this day.

Despite having had 14 books published since, never hearing  my father say ‘well done’ or ‘I’m proud of you’ still leaves me with a gaping hole in my heart. It was no coincidence that, aged 16, I fixed on a man of 38 as my first great love. But while he gave me my first kiss, he ultimately rejected me, and I was bereft.

Consequently I didn’t look to men for reinforcement, kindness or praise, or live my life waiting for Prince Charming to save me.

Instead, I carved out my own existence and lived my life as my own woman, strong and independent, determined to follow my own destiny rather than merely be the frame to some man’s picture.

My father was not  so cruel to my six  sisters, five of whom  he had with two different women and who were a good deal younger than me. I think he had grown up by the time  they arrived and was  more warm and loving  with them.

Yet he still seemed to encourage us to compete with one another for his affections. In fact, it was only after his death that I grew close to my three eldest  half-sisters, Nancy, Bridie  and Sadie.

Today I like, love and respect all three of them, and cherish our times together, but I am still bitter that by trying to pit us against one another, my father deprived me of the happiness of growing up with my sisters, and having them in my life through the years.

On his deathbed in London’s St Thomas’s hospital in 1997, with all of us gathered around him,  he pointed to each of us in turn, explaining what he thought of us, saying one was pretty, another clever, a third funny. And me?

‘She’s nothing,’ he said. Even at the end, he reserved the cruellest blow for me, his eldest daughter.

I never did understand what prompted such deep disdain. When I asked my mother, quick as a flash she said: ‘Deep down, he was still a child, and was jealous and competitive and wanted all the praise for himself.’

The end result was that he just couldn’t bring himself to give me the praise and love for which I longed. By withholding it, he remained in control and that, above all, mattered to him.

The very last time I saw him in hospital, too weak to reach into his bedside drawer, he asked me to get something for him. As I did, I saw a copy of the magazine in which I had published an article. It was dog-eared and well thumbed. Just as I lifted it out, my father’s nurse appeared.

‘Oh, you’re the writer,’ she said. ‘Your father is always talking about you. He’s so proud of you.’As my eyes filled with tears, I turned to my father, but he looked away and said nothing.
