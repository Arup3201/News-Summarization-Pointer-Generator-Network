Shocking CCTV footage shows the little girl, who entered the store wearing a colourful backpack, sneamking under the counter and into the section where the jewellery is stored.

After a few moments, she reappears carrying what looks to be a bundle of money which reportedly contained more than 500,000 Saudi Ryal (£90,000).
