We have all been there. Walking home after a particularly arduous night out, you sometimes just feel like a lie-down.

For one unfortunate friend of mine, that meant seeking shelter under a pile of newspapers on someone's doorstep.

If only he had had a shoe tent. Australian design firm Sibling has unveiled an ingenious invention - the Walking Shelter - that is basically a pair of hi-top running shoes with a full-sized tent cached in the netting on the heel.

Walking home and need a rest? Thank goodness you have a tent stashed in your shoes!

Okay, so the design is not the most 
subtle - the streamlined shape of the trainers is compromised slightly 
by the bulging fabric stuffed in the netting.

But, as anyone who has tramped miles 
across fields to reach their camping spot at a festival will testify, 
the alternative (lugging a heavy, cumbersome bag of tent) is a lot 
worse.

Dismiss any romantic notion of 
camping a deux under the stars though - this is less Out Of Africa and 
more Bear Grylls' fashionista sister's idea of survival in the wild - with a 21st Century fashion 
update.

With no poles to hold it up, the wearer has to use their own
head, hands and legs as supports - meaning they are likely to get quite
wet.

The
trainers are not unlike a pair of regular hi-tops, but with the tent 
bundled up and cached in netting along the sides and at the rear of the 
shoe

Sibling, who 
created the Walking Shelter as a conceptual design project rather than 
intending for it to be used as a fully functioning tent, say the garment is a 'human shelter stored within a pair of 
sneakers'.

'Stored 
compactly in integrated net pockets within the shoe, the shelter expands
out and around the body to form an enclosure that relies on the human 
frame as a supporting structure,' they say.

'The
shelter accommodates for the body in a variety of ways and can be 
customised by the user to adapt to a variety of contexts and 
environments.'

The only drawback? With no poles or pegs, the person themselves acts as the supports for the tent, making it tricky to pop out to get the beans on the Calor stove

... and should it rain, the spontaneous camper's hands and feet wouldget a little wet, and their head where it touches the canvas. To be entirely fair though, the tent was created more as a conceptual design piece than functioning back country gear

The trainers, created by Australian design firm Sibling, feature a pull-out tent that becomes a fully functioning shelter

The tent has no poles - making it incredibly light to transport - but less than practical in the wild. More of a wind-proof shelter to eat a sandwich than a tent for a night in the back country

The tent pulls out rapidly and, once the wearer sits down - they have to provide the support for the tent - the shelter is erected
