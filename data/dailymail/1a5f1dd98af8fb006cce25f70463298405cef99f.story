Skiers are being invited to add a bit of luxury to their trips to the slopes by opting for a helicopter transfer from airport to their resort.

PrivateFly has launched a new helicopter service, offering exclusive fixed pricing on private helicopter transfers to popular European ski resorts that starts from just £185 each way per person. 

The private jet booking service says the service has been launched to reflect increasing demand for shorter ski breaks and shorter booking lead times – and offers market-leading prices and service.  

The helicopter transfers will whisk skiers to the slopes form the airport from £185

It is available to those who want to book a helicopter flight only, in addition to the company's private jet clients.

Adam Twidell, CEO of PrivateFly, comments: 'With the popularity of short ski breaks on the rise, it's never been more of a priority to maximise time on the slopes – and minimise the time to get there.

'Our existing private jet clients know how many hours can be saved by landing as close as possible to the resort, by using smaller airports. Helicopter transfers make the journey even faster, and can be combined with a private jet flight or an airline flight. 

'For example a helicopter transfer from Grenoble to Courchevel takes just 25 minutes, compared to a drive time of between two and three hours – even longer in busy traffic. For a return journey this can gain an extra half day on the slopes.

'We are seeing more clients booking ski breaks at short notice and our private charter helicopter service is fast, transparent and easy to arrange. We have secured preferred fixed rates with local helicopter operators, so there is no waiting around for a quote.

With the price of renting a car being as much as £600 a week at some ski resorts, taking the helicopter works out as the cheaper option

Taking a helicopter from airport to ski resort is perfect if families are on a short-time trip

'Of course the luxury of a helicopter transfer can add considerably to the enjoyment of a ski trip, but it is the compelling time-saving benefits that attract many customers.'

The new service offers helicopter flights from 14 airports in France and Switzerland, directly into popular ski resorts, such as Meribel, Courchevel, Val D'Isere and Val Thorens. There is a choice of helicopter type - from a single engine AS350 (seats five or six) to a EC155 twin engine helicopter, which offers a faster journey; spacious VIP club seating for 6 people; and a bigger luggage capacity. 

Several of the helicopter models also offer additional secure storage for skis underneath the aircraft.

The idea of taking a helicopter ahead of the road is hoping to take off in New York too.

Airport shuttle service Gotham Air are chartering flights from Manhattan to both JFK and Newark Liberty Airports from just $99 (£65).

Taking the helicopter in New York will ease the stresses of airport travel

What's more it will give you plenty of time to make your flight - the expected journey time is cut from two hours by road to just six minutes.

And the cost is equivalent to that of a black cab. 

The special $99 fare applies to first-time flyers however, thereafter it will range from $199 - $219. 

PrivateFly says its prices are fixed and instant, unlike other helicopter companies, whose prices can vary on the same route, and who can take hours to quote. Prices per person start from £185 (€243) for a one-way flight from Annecy to Courchevel, based on a group of six travelling together in a AS350 (€1460 for the whole aircraft).

The helicopter option may not seem so exclusive after all as travellers heading for the piste this half-term face a barrage of extra costs at the car rental desk meaning they could end up paying over two times as much as they had originally budgeted for.

iCarhireinsurance.com, the leading provider of stand-alone car hire excess insurance, researched seven European ski gateways to see how a traveller’s costs snowballed on picking up their hire car.

Hiring a car for the week across the seven locations of Geneva, Grenoble, Turin, Innsbruck, Barcelona, Sophia and Inverness costs on average £214. However once 'extras', paid for at the rental desk, are factored in a traveller could be looking at an average final bill in the region of £600.

Geneva is the most expensive place to hire a car to go skiing. It costs on average £313 to hire a car, plus on average £486 for the extras. Sofia is the most reasonable place to hire a car to go skiing, with rental costs averaging about £130 and extras at £202.

Extras include an average cost of £96 for a week’s car hire excess insurance or waiver, £25 for a tyre and windscreen excess policy, £50 for an extra driver (£122 if they’re under 25 yrs), hiring a sat nav costing £75, payment for winter tyres costing £48, a roof rack (for skis) costing £34 and a child’s car seat for £51 - a grand total of £379 extra paid to the rental company.
