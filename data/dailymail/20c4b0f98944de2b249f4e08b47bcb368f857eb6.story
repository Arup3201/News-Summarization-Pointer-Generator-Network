University of Bolton vice chancellor Professor George Holmes has been given a £1million loan by his employers so he can move nearer to the campus

A struggling university was slammed yesterday for loaning its vice-chancellor £1million for a luxurious Edwardian house.

Professor George Holmes of the University of Bolton had a 100-mile round-trip to work, from his home in Yorkshire.

But it has emerged the university gave him a two-year £960,000 loan to buy a house nearer Bolton, Greater Manchester, without selling his existing property.

The sum could buy seven average £133,400 houses in the town.

But the 53-year-old spent £920,000 on an imposing detached house, described by estate agents as a ‘sublime’ example of the Arts and Crafts movement.

With the university faring badly in measures such as student satisfaction, and staff facing delays in pay rises, the move drew fierce criticism yesterday.

Professor Holmes, a former adviser to Labour, was made vice-chancellor in 2006, two years after Bolton Institute of Higher Education became a university. In 2013 it ranked worst in the country in two university guides.

That year, he received the biggest pay rise of any vice-chancellor in the country, with a £47,200 bonus to ‘incentivise’ him to stay.

With a £198,200-a-year salary, this took his annual pay package to a reported £256,200.

In November, after eight years of travelling from Wakefield every day, Professor Holmes announced his intention to move his family to Bolton, saying it would allow him to ‘play a greater role’ in the university and the town.

The university’s accounts reveal its board unanimously approved a £960,000 bridge loan to enable the father-of-two to buy a house nearby. The loan, at a 3.25 per cent interest rate, will be paid off once his Yorkshire home is sold.

The academic was said to be unavailable for comment yesterday at his £965,000 detached red-brick house in Wakefield, which did not have a For Sale sign outside. It belongs to a woman understood to be his new partner. His wife, who lives nearby, declined to comment.

Land Registry documents show he has bought a four-bedroom Edwardian house with four acres of land for £920,000. 

One neighbour said it was ‘an incredible amount of money paid by tuition fees’. Aktar Khan, 21, one of the university’s 4,500 students, said the ‘excessive’ sum ‘could be used now for facilities’.

The university was recently accused of being the only higher education institution not to award staff a 1 per cent pay rise.

A University and College Union spokesman said: ‘The priority for a university should be looking after all staff, not lending the vice-chancellor tens of thousands of pounds.’

John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added that the money should go towards ‘delivering high-quality education, not into glorified mortgages’.

A university spokesman said Professor Holmes’ loan and relocation ‘has helped secure the continued services of an excellent vice-chancellor’.

The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said ‘day to day financial management decisions’ were a matter for the university and its board. 

Prof Holmes is paid almost £200,000 a year to run the university, which charges £9,000 tuition fees
