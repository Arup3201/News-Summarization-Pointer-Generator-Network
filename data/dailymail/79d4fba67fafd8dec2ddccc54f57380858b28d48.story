A grandfather poured beer over a crying toddler in a pub because the noise ruined his lunch plans, a court heard today.

Danny Polak, 64, lost his temper when a 15-month-old child started making 'grizzling' sounds in the Ernehale pub in Arnold, Nottinghamshire.

He soaked the toddler in ale and then kicked the boy's mother, Rachel Atkin, in the backside when she went to confront him.

Assault: Danny Polak became so irritated by noises made by a toddler in this pub in Arnold, Nottinghamshire, that he poured his beer over the boy

Polak was fined £355 and ordered to pay £50 in compensation when he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court and admitted two counts of assault.

The hearing was told that Miss Atkin had gone to the pub with her son and sister-in-law, Rebecca White, on the afternoon of June 11 this year after a morning at a soft play centre.

After they took seats at a table next to Polak and his wife, Miss Atkin went to order food at the bar, leaving Miss White to look after the child.

Catherine Picardo, prosecuting, said that the child: 'started to whine as though he was missing his mother.'

'The defendant, with a half-full pint in his hand, approached the table and poured it over the baby’s head, which caused him to scream.'

Ms Picardo told the court that, when confronted by Miss Atkin, Polak told the mother: 'You shouldn’t bring kids in a pub.'

Miss Atkin responded by throwing her own drink at Polak and said: 'See how you like it.'

The court heard that Miss Atkin then turned her back on Polak, who kicked her and fled.

Guilty: Polak, 64, admitted two counts of assault when he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court

Miss Picardo said: 'It is quite shocking behaviour as it involved a 15-month old child.

'It took place in a family pub where children are entitled to be.'

Maria Bines, defending, said: 'He was having a quite drink with his wife. He thought rather than go to the bar, the mother should have stayed to attend her son.

'He threw the beer in the general direction of the table where the females were sitting.

'He accepts that beer went over the baby and that his actions were reckless.

'He accepts he kicked her in the bottom. It wasn’t done in malice, it was just so he could have the last word.

'He accepts that what he did was wrong. He is not proud of what he has done, and accepts that it will have to be punished.'

Polak, of Sherwood, Nottingham, told police that he had been angry because the noisy child had forced him and his wife to abandon plans to have lunch at the pub, which they only did once a month.

Speaking shortly after the incident, Miss Atkin said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was so shocked.

'I just stood there for a second and then I ran up to his table and shouted at him.

'I could hear my son crying when I was at the bar and my friend said he’d been shouting about it before he poured the drink over my son.

'But it’s no excuse to pour a drink on him, it just made him cry even more.'It’s just scary to think someone would do that to a baby that is crying.'
