A 15-year-old boy accused of helping the alleged killer of two female police officers claims he's innocent.

The boy was held on suspicion of assisting Dale Cregan after officers swooped on his school on Friday.

He was interviewed for six hours before being bailed and is due to be questioned again next week.

Cregan, 29, appeared in court on Friday charged with the murders of Pc Fiona Bone, 32, and Pc Nicola Hughes, 23.

The boy was arrested at 2.30pm as he sat in a class at his school, in Hattersley.

He was handcuffed in the corridor in front of stunned classmates before being taken away by three plain-clothes officers.

The boy told the Manchester Evening News that he couldn't understand why he'd been arrested.

Dale Cregan will spend the weekend at Manchester’s infamous Strangeways prison (above).

His
 police van sped him to the jail only a mile away from the magistrates 
court in central Manchester that he appeared before this morning.

The judge told him he would be remanded in custody and will appear at the crown court on Monday, where he could ask for bail.

Its
 famous design has a central snowflake shaped building, with two blocks 
and ten wings of cells running from it with a famous giant watchtower 
rising upwards.

It has 
housed various infamous killers who have appeared at Manchester 
Magistrates Court and were remanded in custody there to await trial.

Ian Brady, the Moors Murder was held there as was ‘Dr Death’ Harold Shipman.

Strangeways
 has more than 1,200 prisoners and was originally built in 1868. It was 
also one of the first in Britain to have permanent gallows, used to hang
 more than 100 people up until 1964. Many were buried in the grounds of 
the prison in unmarked graves.

Much of the prison was damaged or destroyed during riots by inmates there in 1990 (above)

Between
 April 1 and April 25 almost 150  and 47 prisoners were injured - 
including one death  among the prisoners. It needed £80m of Government 
cash to rebuild it and Strangeways was then renamed Her Majesty’s 
Prison, Manchester.

He added: 'I was scared. I didn't know what was going to happen to me and I still don't know why they'd want to arrest me.'

The boy's father added that he wanted to 'get to the bottom' of why he'd been arrested.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry 
Shewan, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'We have arrested a 
15-year-old on suspicion of assisting an offender.

'This remains a complex and sensitive
 investigation and we continue to ask the public to search their 
conscience and urge anyone who has any information to contact us.'

In court on Friday, there were only a
 few paces between the door to the cells and his place in the dock, but 
Dale Cregan still managed to walk them with a swagger.

Five policemen stood so close to him 
they were almost touching, and four more carrying sub-machine guns 
watched him constantly from the well of the crowded court.

This
 was the one-eyed murder suspect’s first appearance before a judge after
 being arrested over the savage deaths of two policewomen. He marked it 
with a yawn.

It happened just before the first mention of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in  the charges that were being read to him.

He glanced around the room with his one good eye.

Every police officer stared back.

In
 one of the biggest security operations ever mounted for a magistrates’ 
court appearance, the man whose face had appeared on wanted posters and 
billboards around Manchester was finally seen in public.

He had a full beard now and looked 
considerably thinner than in that now-familiar photograph. The false eye
 was the same – an onyx one in his left eye socket, giving him a 
pronounced squint.

In a tight-fitting, dark blue 
sweatshirt  and tracksuit trousers, he had the appearance of a 
bodybuilder – but compared to  the burly officers who surrounded him 
behind half inch-thick glass in the dock, he looked tiny.

There was a seat in the dock and he went straight towards it and sat down.

Instantly,
 the judge told him to stand. He spoke only once to confirm his name and
 date of birth and stood mostly with his unshackled hands folded in 
front of him.

Two minutes later, it was all over.

The
 comparatively low-key performance of the man accused of two murders 
that horrified the nation was in dramatic contrast to the operation 
deemed necessary to bring him to Manchester city magistrates.

The
 two policewomen were mown down in a gun and grenade attack on Tuesday, 
and police had already said they could not rule out the possibility that
 more grenades were in criminal hands in the city.

So
 on a dark, miserably wet morning, roadblocks were set up around the 
court building and officers carrying Heckler and Koch carbines took up 
positions inside and out.

A heavily-armed convoy brought him to court in a van more than  two hours before he was due to appear.

Meanwhile in a tiny courtroom on the fourth floor, every seat was taken.

Among
 those in the public gallery was a young man wearing a grey jacket 
bearing printed portraits of Mark Short, another of Cregan’s alleged 
victims, above the words ‘RIP Mark’.

Visitor: Michelle Short, widow of David Short 
and mother of Mark Short, was in court while another family member wore a
 hoodie with a tribute to Mark on it

Sitting alongside him was Michelle Short, widow of Mark’s father David Short, who is also alleged to have been killed by Cregan.

Neither
 of the PCs’ families attended, according to court staff, and if any of 
Cregan’s relatives or friends were in court, none was identified.

Downstairs,
 two officers with sub-machine guns, flak jackets and black armoured 
outfits monitored everyone coming through the security search. Even 
inside, they wore their jet black protective glasses.

In a scene rarely witnessed in Britain, four officers brought their weapons into the courtroom and stood guard.

Whatever
 unseen arrangements were made to get the defendant securely into the 
dock, it took more than five minutes to put them into operation after 
district judge Jonathan Taaffe ordered him to be brought.

Victim: Fiona Bone, left, with partner Clare Curran. The couple were planning their civil partnership ceremony

Convoy: Cregan, held in the police van with the blue roof, was swept quickly out of court after his hearing with huge police protection

Custody: Cregan was driven to the nearby Strangeways prison, where the gates were already open, allowing the van to speed straight into its huge complex where he will be held until Monday

Cregan was charged with four counts of murder and four of attempted murder.

Apart
 from the killing of the two PCs, he is accused of killing Mark Short at
 the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden, Tameside, on May 25 and his father 
David in an attack at his home in Clayton, Manchester, on August 10.

He is further accused of attempting 
to murder Michael Belcher, Ryan Pridding and John Collins, who were in 
the pub at the time; and Sharon Hark on August 10.

The judge ordered him to be remanded in custody and to appear at Manchester Crown Court on Monday.

A police convoy duly took him to the city’s Strangeways jail to await the next stage of what is likely to be a lengthy legal process.

Ten miles away on the Hattersley estate where Fiona, 32, and Nicola, 23, fell, forensic officers were still working at the scene.

The floral tributes and messages of condolence continued to arrive.

Charged: Cregan is also  accused of the murders of David Short (left) and his son Mark Short (right)
