The controversial new European Commission President is not a ‘sort of green-eyed federalist monster’, Lord Mandelson claimed today.

The former Labour Cabinet minister insisted Jean-Claude Juncker was not pushing for a United States of Europe and feared Britain exiting the EU would be a ‘disaster’.

But he warned David Cameron to stop brandishing his in-out referendum like ‘some sort of pistol’ to threaten other EU leaders: ‘Agree with us, or else’.

Mr Juncker was confirmed as the new President of the European Commission on Friday, after Mr Cameron became embroiled in bitter row with his EU counterparts.

Mr Cameron condemned the decision as a ‘bad day for Europe’.

The Tories, Labour and Lib Dems all agreed Mr Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, was the wrong person for the job.

It is feared his reputation as a pro-federalist will make it harder for Mr Cameron to claw powers back from Brussels.

Lord Mandelson conceded Mr Juncker was not an ‘ideal candidate’ but insisted there were ‘encouraging signs’ that he is open to Britain’s demands.

David Cameron's strategy to try to stop Jean-Claude Juncker from getting the Brussels job by a former top diplomat.

David Frost, former EU director at the Foreign Office and until last year the government's top trade official, said the strategy 'was, and is, the right thing to try to get someone other than Juncker'. 

Writing on his blog, Mr Frost added: 'He’s a corporatist, unsympathetic to flexibility and subsidiarity, and doesn’t seem to have much sympathy for the UK’s thinking. 

'That’s not what the EU needs just now.'

He added: 'On issues that matter in the EU, you are always best stating your case forcibly, politely, but clearly.'

Mr Frost warned of 'a bit of bumpiness' in Britain's relationship with Germany, but said it depends on 'whether either Cameron or Merkel think they were genuinely misled by the other in any of their discussions'.

Lord Mandelson, a former European Commissioner, met Mr Juncker at a summit in Berlin last week.

‘He explicitly said that he does not advocate a United States of Europe – he’s not a sort of green-eyed federalist monster, as some in Britain have portrayed him,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘Secondly, he strongly agreed with me when I said that, were Britain to leave the European Union, it wouldn’t just be a catastrophe for Britain, it would be a disaster for the European Union as a whole.

‘And the third thing I was struck by was his emphasis on the economy in Europe and the need to drive up our competitiveness and our share in global markets. And that would mean he accepted extending and deepening Europe’s single market.

‘So these are encouraging signs about his policy agenda and we’ve now got to set about working with him in them.’

Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron today insisted he can still secure reforms to Britain's relationship with Europe.

'I am ready to move on and keep fighting for Britain's interests in Europe,' he wrote.

Referring to previous claims by Mr Juncker that he was ready to deliver a 'fair deal' for Britain, Mr Cameron said: 'If by a fair deal, we can agree that we are not heading, at different speeds, to the same place - as some have assumed up to now - then there is business we can do.'

However, Lord Mandelson warned the Prime Minister against repeatedly using his threat of an in-out referendum by 2017 to get what he wants in Europe.

‘I would just give this advice to the Prime Minister: stop waving around this threat of a referendum in Britain as if it’s some sort of pistol that we’re holding to everyone’s head and saying ‘you’ve got to agree with us, or else’.’

He said Mr Cameron had to come up with reforms of benefit to Europe as a whole and not just give the impression that the only reason that he is advocating these measures is because of divisions in the Tory party.

‘The problem is that the Prime Minister in the way he’s gone about handling Britain’s interests in Europe has rather isolated himself.

‘He makes it more difficult for people to back him, even when they agree with the points he is making.

‘He does find it very difficult now to get others in the European Union to follow him on anything and that, I’m afraid, is a direct result of the way in which he’s conducted his case in Brussels.’
