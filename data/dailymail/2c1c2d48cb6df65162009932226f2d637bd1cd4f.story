Liverpool are showing an interest in Uruguay and Benfica defender Maxi Pereira, according to Portuguese newspaper A Bola. 

After talks have stalled between agent and club over a contract extension with the Primeira Liga champions, the 30-year-old right back is said to be on the radar at Anfield following Glen Johnson's dip in form. 

With Jon Flanagan yet to make an appearance this season through injury and Javi Manquillo struggling to break into Brendan Rodgers' side, Pereira's 95 international caps will be a definite selling point for the Benfica man.
