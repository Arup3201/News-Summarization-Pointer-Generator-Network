After Italy  struggled to see off lowly Malta on Monday night, the Italian papers have been scathing in their reviews of Antonio Conte's flops - with the exception of Southampton striker Graziano Pelle.

Pelle, who earned his call-up after four goals in his first six Premier League games, scored the only goal of the game on debut to spare his side's blushes.

And the Italian press hailed their new hero, with the Saints star dominating the front pages alongside criticism of the rest of the team.

The Southampton star was clearly delighted with his impact, and was hailed as the hero in Italy

Graziano Pelle has made a brilliant start to life in England, scoring six times in ten appearances for club and country since leaving Feyenoord: 

v Millwall  (Capital One Cup)

v West Ham  (Premier League)

v Newcastle x2 (Premier League)

v QPR (Premier League)

v Malta (Euro 2016 qualifiers)

La Gazzetta dello Sport claim 'Pelle is there, Italy aren't', while Corriere dello Sport says it was 'Pelle, and that's it' for Italy.

Even Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli congratulated the man who was picked ahead of him, posting a picture of Pelle to his Instagram with the message 'Well done Italy! Very well done Pelle, keep it up!'

However, the rest of the Azzurri were treated less kindly, with Corriere describing the display as 'poor' and 'disappointing', and saved only by the debutant.

Gazzetta point out that Malta were down to ten men for most of the game, yet Conte's side could only score one, but does concede that the points are the most important thing.

Tuttosport is more complementary towards the national team, leading on the fact that, since he took over, Conte has picked up four wins from four.
