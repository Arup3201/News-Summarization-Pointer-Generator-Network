A 15-year-old high school student has become the second boy to die after playing the 'choking game' in a small Colorado town in two years.

Sean Hill, a ninth-grader at Discovery Canyon High School in Colorado Springs, died in his home on Friday - nearly 21 months after 12-year-old Gian-Luc Jordan passed away after playing the game.

During the 'choking game' children temporarily asphyxiate themselves - either with the help of friends or by momentarily hanging themselves - to the point of passing out to achieve a brief high.

But the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said children do not realize the deadly dangers of hanging or strangulation, and many of the game's victims die while playing it alone.

The school district released a statement on Monday on behalf of Sean's parents, who decided to share the cause of his death in order to warn others of the game's dangers.

'Sean died accidentally while 
experimenting with what's commonly referred to as the "choking game",' it read, asking parents and students to 'please 
make safe decisions'.

'He enjoyed Tae Kwon Do, debate, theater [and] piano,' Sean's obituary reads. 'He was a mentor to younger kids and active in many school activities. He was a loving son, brother, grandson and friend.'

Loss: Gian-Luc, pictured with his siblings, was found unconscious in his room in August 2011 and later died

Warning: His mother, Petra Verhoeven-Jordan, now works to raise awareness of the dangerous game

During the 'choking game', children temporarily asphyxiate 
themselves - either with the help of friends or by hanging 
themselves - to the point of passing out to achieve a brief high.

The game is also known as space 
monkey, pass-out game, airplaning, flat lining, purple hazing, cloud nine and many 
other names.

The CDC said that 87 per cent of the victims 
are boys, and nearly all were playing alone. Most of the deaths occur between 11 and 16.

The CDC advises parents to look for 
warning signs that children might be playing the game, such as marks on 
their neck, bloodshot eyes disorientation after being alone, and noticing ties or belts tied around doorknobs or furniture.

Gian-Luc Jordan's family has created the website www.lucastrong.com to educate children and their families about the game.

Gian-Luc, a seventh-grader, died in August 2011 after he was found hanging from his bunk bed.

His father found him unconscious when he went to get him for a soccer game.

The boy, who was an honor roll student and a popular school athlete, suffered brain damage and never regained consciousness.

Now his family is trying to raise awareness of the deadly game.

Speaking to News 5, Gian-Luc's mother Petra Verhoeven-Jordan warned of the dangers of the game and the pain it can inflict on a family.

'Your family will never be the same, there's a person missing no matter what,' she said.

'It's unimaginable because two children within two years in this community dying of the same cause that is so avoidable.'

District spokeswoman Nanette Anderson toldÂ The Colorado Springs Gazette that crisis counselors were at Discovery Canyon on Monday to talk with children, and many opted for further counseling on Tuesday.

Advice: Staff at Discovery Canyon High School, where Sean was a student, said they regularly addressed risky behaviors such as drugs, alcohol and the choking game with its students

She added that after Gian-Luc's death, the school had spoken to children and parents about 'risky behaviors', touching on the choking game as well as drug and alcohol consumption.

The issues are addressed at least once or twice throughout the district, with individual schools talking to their students about them much more frequently, she said.

A graveside service at Monument Cemetery and a later reception were held on Tuesday to remember Sean, who is survived by his parents and sister, Bridgit.
