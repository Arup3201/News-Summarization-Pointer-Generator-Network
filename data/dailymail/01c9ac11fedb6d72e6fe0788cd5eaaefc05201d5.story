Ominous clouds gathered over a Michigan city on Monday night, leading residents to question what was causing the bulbous formations and if they were a sign of rough weather ahead.

As the orange-tinged clouds were spotted at about 8.30pm above Iron Mountain, residents posted pictures of them on social media to see if anyone could identify what they were.

Meteorologist Jeff Last was finally able to resolve the mystery through Twitter, when he identified the phenomenon as Mammatus.

Strange forecast: Joe Nottage took pictures of the clouds as they gathered over Iron Mountain

His tweet was in response to a picture Joe Nottage had put online, as he asked: 'Can anyone explain this?' Skye reported.

Another resident, Jason Asselin, filmed the clouds as they gathered over the city.

'All of a sudden it got very yellow outside, it felt strange and mysterious,' he wrote on YouTube. 

'It was the craziest thing I have ever witnessed over my head. I almost expected to see a tornado or something.' 

Eerie: The sky was tinged with orange as the bulbous clouds appeared, catching the attention of many residents

Mammatus are bulbous formations that are found under other clouds.

While most clouds have flat bottoms, Mammatus have round pouches that are caused by sinking air.

This has led to cloud physicists referring to the shape as being caused by negative buoyancy.

Their name is said to be derived from the Latin for breast.

The clouds, which often form in turbulent air, can stretch for hundreds of miles and can be a sign of a gathering storm.

For the clouds to form, there must be a sharp change in temperature.

His
 assumption that the formation, which gathers under a larger cloud, is a
 forewarning of severe weather was close to the truth.

The clouds, which are formed after a sharp change in temperature or moisture, can sometimes be a sign of an approaching thunderstorm or, in some cases, a tornado.

Other people struggled to describe the strange and beautiful weather phenomenon.

In his blog for the city's Daily News, Chris Tomassucci said: 'The pictures really don't capture how eerie the whole experience was.'

He added: 'The mammatocumulus that formed over Iron Mountain made everything take on strange coloration. Greens looked more green, blues more blue, and so on.'
