In a weekend where the rest of last season's top four - Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool - all dropped points, Chelsea fans could be forgiven for a bit of crowing.

Diego Costa's hat-trick inspired the 4-2 win over Swansea which put the Blues top of the Premier League, with the maximum 12 points from their four games so far.

However, the last 10 years suggest Chelsea fans shouldn't count their chickens just yet.

2013-14: Arsenal - City win title

2012-13: Chelsea - United win title

2011-12: United - City win title

2010-11: Chelsea - United win title

2009-10: Chelsea - Chelsea win title

2008-09: Liverpool - United win title

2007-08: Arsenal - United win title

2006-07: Portsmouth - United win title

2005-06: Chelsea - Chelsea win title

2004-05: Arsenal - Chelsea win title

Only twice in the past decade have the team who have been top after four games ended up as champions.

This time last year Arsenal were looking down on everyone after four games, but come May they were in fourth staring up at title winners Manchester City.

The Gunners have made a habit of starting well, but ending up without the coveted trophy.

Over the past 10 years Arsene Wenger's side have been top three times during the early stages without managing to finish the job while Manchester United have won the league five times without spectacular starts - indeed, in 2006-07, the early leaders were Portsmouth.

And just two years ago Chelsea - then European champions under Roberto Di Matteo - were flying high at the top of the league.

Rafael Benitez took over Chelsea after Di Matteo's eventual sacking but they finished way off the pace of Sir Alex Ferguson's final title at Manchester United.

The piece of good news for Jose Mourinho, though, is that the trophy has ended up at Stamford Bridge on the two occasions in which a club ahead after four games has won the Premier League.

Mourinho's second season in English football, 2005-06, saw his Chelsea team race into an early lead before claiming a second successive title.

And Carlo Ancelotti's 2010 Premier League triumph - part of a Chelsea double - kicked off in the perfect way as they won their first six games.

However, history is not on Costa, Fabregas and Co's side - and there may be light at the end of the blue tunnel for Chelsea's challengers.
