Once associated with extreme fussy eaters and devoted animal rights activists, veganism is now becoming cool thanks to a number of celebrities embracing the diet.

Jennifer Lopez credits veganism with helping her stay svelte and looking decades younger than her 45-years.

Health guru Gwyneth Paltrow is of course another advocate of the plant-based diet and shared her passion for it in her book It's All Good.

Meanwhile, Beyonce and her husband Jay-Z went on a 22-day vegan diet earlier this year and the pair have continued to eat less animal products as a result. 

The stars credit the eating plan, which involves avoiding all animal foods such as meat, dairy and eggs, for helping them look and feel better.

Lily Simpson, founder of London based healthy food delivery company, The Detox Kitchen, says that limiting the amount of animal products in your diet, even for just a few days – will help your digestive system restore.

‘Protein is very hard to digest, by allowing your digestive system to rest through an animal protein detox, your body will feel light and cleansed,’ she said.

It seems like Lily, many people are becoming converted to a part-time vegan lifestyle. 

The Detox Kitchen, which also has a deli at Harvey Nichols and in Kingly Street, has found that more and more people are choosing their vegan option from their five-detox packages. 

Model Lara Stone relied on healthy food deliveries from company to help her get back into shape after she gave birth.

The Vegan Society estimates that there are 150,000 vegans in the UK and sales of vegan products are on the up. 

Many people have converted to veganism following studies which have concluded that red meat like steak and burgers can raise the risk of developing heart disease and cancer because it's high in saturated fat. 

However some nutritionists argue that veganism isn't necessarily the answer for a long, healthy life as it may lead to followers being deficient in protein, iron and other vitamins and minerals. 

Milk, cheese, chicken and fish are high in protein - which is essential for many of the body's biological processes including building and repairing muscle.

Meanwhile, red meat is one of the best sources of iron - which helps make red blood cells to carry carry oxygen around the body - and a number of essential B vitamins. An iron deficiency can lead to feeling constantly tired and low in energy. 

Lily agrees that nutrient deficiency can lead to fatigue and even illnesses, however vegans do not necessarily need to experience this. 

‘As long as you are replacing the calcium and protein in your diet with the correct foods, you shouldn’t see any negative effects on your energy levels,' she explains. 'The most important thing when going vegan is ensuring that you replace the protein, it is really important to have at least 50g protein per day.

'You can get this from eating a varied diet full of pulses and grains - quinoa is great. You can also add spirulina and flaxseed into your juices for an extra nutrient boost’.  

According to Lily, moving towards a vegan diet doesn't have to mean restricting yourself indefinitely. You can follow the plan for a set period, like Beyonce and Jay-Z, or on certain days of the week.

Lily says that she has noticed a difference to her appearance and well-being since limiting the amount of dairy and sticking to fish and lean white meats when she does eat animal protein. 

‘I definitely notice I have brighter, clearer skin since adopting a diet based on plant based, natural foods,' she said.

For those keen to try it but unsure if they can commit to a life without meat, Lily has the following advice.

'One vegan meal per day is a great way to start. Having a vegan meal for lunch is best, there are lots of great salad bars doing big quinoa salads or great vegan veggie burgers.'

If you can't or don't want to give up meat for good, Lily recommends 'sticking to lean, unprocessed meats' like chicken over red meat. 

She added: ‘The important thing is to ensure you are eating a well-balanced and healthy diet, based on natural foods and local produce. There is so much conflicting information of what a healthy diet entails, we stick to a simple formula. All our food is free from wheat, dairy and refined sugar, and is created using fresh, seasonal ingredients.'

Ingredients

Courgette noodle salad with cashew pesto dressing

Method

1. Preheat the oven at 180°C 

2. Cut the mange tout lengthwise into thin strips.

3. Rinse and noodle the courgettes using a julienne peeler or a noodle machine.

4. Toast off the sunflower seeds and cashew nuts separately in the oven for a few minutes. Leave to cool.

5. In a large bowl, mix together the mange tout, the courgette noodles and the sunflower seeds.

6. Make the cashew pesto – Put the cashews and herbs together in a food processor and blitz. While blitzing slowly add the oil and the lemon juice until it gets to the right consistency. It should look like a smooth paste. 

7. Check for seasoning. Mix the pesto (using what you think is enough) in with the courgettes, mange tout and sunflower seeds. Serve cold with some baby leaf spinach or on it’s own.
