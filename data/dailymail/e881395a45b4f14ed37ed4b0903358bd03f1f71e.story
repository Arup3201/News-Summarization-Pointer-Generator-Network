Wayne Rooney admits he would swap his century of England caps to win a World Cup or European Championship with his country.

The England forward, who wins his 100th cap this weekend against Slovenia at Wembley, has never been beyond a quarter-final with the national team.

He said: ‘I could sit here saying I’ve got 200 caps and 100 goals for my country, but the ultimate is to win a trophy and that’s what we all want to do.

But the Three Lions captain says he wants to emulate Bobby Moore and win an international trophy

Peter Shilton - 125

David Beckham - 115

Steven Gerrard - 114

Bobby Moore - 108

Ashley Cole - 107

Sir Bobby Charlton - 106

Frank Lampard - 106

Billy Wright - 105

‘That’s why we play football, to win. That’s the target and hopefully sometime soon we can achieve that.

‘Obviously I’m not going to be as big a legend as Sir Bobby Charlton – he’s won the World Cup with England, so to eclipse that I’d have to win the World Cup, which would be a massive achievement.

‘The thing that I’ve taken away from Brazil is the hurt at getting knocked out – it was hard to take.

‘But we have to move on, we know what a good squad we have - it’s a relatively young group. We all believe in each other, we believe in the ability we’ve got and we have to go and prove that as a team.

‘To get 100 caps for England, there’s not many players who have done it – would be a great achievement. I’ll be proud to join that club and is something that myself and my family would be honoured by.’

Rooney, who captains England following Steven Gerrarrd’s international retirement, admits he still gets nervous about representing his country.

The England forward, talking in this weekend’s matchday programme, added: ‘The highlight for me is that feeling you get after you’ve sung the national anthem – you run off and hear the crowd, particularly in the big games and the tournaments - you hear the support and you know what it means to the fans and the country.’
