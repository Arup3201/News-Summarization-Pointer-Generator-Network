Barack Obama's Pastor-in-Chief has revealed how the President comforted Sandy Hook victims' families in the days after last year's elementary school massacre.

'The president took a deep breath and 
steeled himself, and went into the first classroom. And what happened next I will never forget,' Joshua DuBois, who joined the U.S. President in Newtown, Connecticut, said.

'Person
 after person received an engulfing hug from our commander in chief. 
He’d say, 'Tell me about your son. . . . Tell me about your daughter', 
and then hold pictures of the lost beloved as their parents described 
favorite foods, television shows, and the sound of their laughter.'

Dubois has shared Obama's 'secret' tender moments with the devastated families in his new book, The President's Devotional: The Daily Readings That Inspired President Obama.

The day after the 14 December shooting, in which 26 people were gunned down by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, Obama asked Dubois to accompany him to Newtown to meet with victims' families.

Before Dubois left, FBI officials briefed him on the horrors of the massacre, including that the children were lined up and executed.

'How the gunman treated the children like criminals, lining them up to shoot them down,' Dubois wrote, according to Huffington Post.

'How so many bullets penetrated them that many were left unrecognizable.

'How the killer went from one classroom to another and would have gone farther if his rifle would’ve let him.'

When Obama arrived at Newtown High School where the meetings would take place, he was briefed on the circumstances of each family.

He then took a deep breath, and met with each grieving family in various classrooms over several hours and asked them to tell him their story.

'For 
the younger siblings of those who had passed away—many of them two, 
three, or four years old, too young to understand it all—the president 
would grab them and toss them, laughing, up into the air, and then hand 
them a box of White House M&M’s, which were always kept close at 
hand,' Dubois wrote.

'In each room, I saw his eyes water, but he did not break...Even a president’s comfort was woefully inadequate for these families in the face of this particularly unspeakable loss.

'But it became some small measure of love, on a weekend when evil reigned.

'And the funny thing is—President Obama has never spoken about these meetings...It must have been one of the defining moments of his presidency, quiet hours in solemn classrooms, extending as much healing as was in his power to extend. But he kept it to himself.'
