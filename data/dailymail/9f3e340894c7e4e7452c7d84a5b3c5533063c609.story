Katie Couric's engagement ring does not disappoint.

The newly-engaged TV host debuted her new diamond, given to her over the weekend by boyfriend of two years John Molner, at Wednesday night's U.S. Open matches.

The ring appears to boast a large, cushion-cut solitaire diamond, placed in a minimalistic white gold or platinum setting.

Love Stoned: Katie Couric attended Wednesday night's U.S. Open matches with new fiance John Molner

The 56-year-old talk show host and 
veteran journalist, who 
was widowed in 1998 after her husband died of colon cancer, admitted that she thought Mr Molner, 50, was being 'pathetic' when he asked her to go for a walk on the beach last weekend.

Radar reports that she told 95.5 PLJ Radio today: 'It was actually very funny. He said, "Hey, do you want to go for a walk on the beach?" And I was like, "Not really," and he said, "Come on" and I said, "Honestly I'm really tired, why don't you just take a bike and you go for a walk on the beach?"'

When her boyfriend persisted still, she said she finally agreed, but only because she thought, 'this is sort of pathetic, he's begging.'

'He was so stealthy about it. I was incredibly impressed that he was able to pull it off!'

But even on the beach, when Mr Molner began talking about how much he loved her, Ms Couric failed to realize that he was on the verge of popping the question.

'He said, "I brought you here for a reason," and I was like, "Why?" and he said, "I wanted to tell you that I really love you," and I'm like, "I know that."'

Then finally, he told her straight: 'He said "Couric I'm trying to propose to you!"'

Ms Couric added that she had no idea the proposal was coming: 'He was so stealthy about it. I was incredibly impressed that he was able to pull it off!'

Cushy appeal: Couric's ring appears to boast a cushion-cut diamond, anchored in a minimalistic setting

The TV star officially 
announced her engagement with an exclusive interview in this week's 
issue of People magazine.

In the interview, she described her new bling as a 'spectacular diamond ring'.

She also expressed that she was surprised it took 15 years to meet a
 'keeper' but added that 'things happen when they're supposed to.

'I hope it shows people that it's never too late, not if you put yourself out there,' the mother-of-two continued.

Mr Molner, head of mergers and 
acquisitions at investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman, popped the 
question over Labor Day weekend at a beach in East Hampton, New York.

Ms Couric said she was 'stunned' by the proposal and had 'no clue' it was on the cards.

She says their nuptials are likely to take place after her youngest daughter Carrie, 17, leaves for college.

Ms Couric told People in 2011 that she
 always imagined herself as a 'modern-day' version of the twice married 
TV character, Carol Brady.

Speaking about 
dating following the death of her first husband, Jay Monahan, she said: 'I thought, it's important for me to go 
out. I'm always excited to meet new people and have a social life.

'I think dating is fun actually. I enjoy that part of my life.'

However, after several failed relationships she worried she would never find another life partner.

'I had a series of relationships . . but they didn't seem right for the long haul,' she said.

However, in early 2012 she met 50-year-old Mr Molner through mutual friends and they soon hit it off.

They first went public with their 
relationship in April 2012 and Ms Couric said later that year, 'He's 
great. He's from Chicago. I
 love Midwesterners!'

She 
told People that she knew he was a 'keeper' when he agreed to go to a 
grocery store with her mother, and helped her find generic - and cheap - pain reliever.

Before Mr Molner, Ms Couric was dating entrepreneur, Brooks Perlin, who is 17 years her junior.

They met at a charity event held to raise money for cancer research in 2006 and remained together for five years.

There was speculation at the time that her new relationship with Mr Molner came too soon after the split.

However, mutual friends of the couple reportedly said that they had been trying to set them up for years.

Mr Molner, who also has two children from a previous marriage, is said to have 
been a fan of Ms Couric's for some time. When he met her, he said he fell for her instantly.

'Meeting Katie really changed my life . . . I couldn't be happier,' he exclaimed.

Mr Molner will become a step-father to Mr Couric's two daughters with Monahan, Ellie, 21, and Carrie, 17.

Making her engagement public on Tuesday, Ms Couric tweeted: 'Yes it's true! So touched by all the kind
 Tweets & warm wishes-thank you! A great end to the summer & 
looking fwd to seeing you all Monday!!'

Her talk show, Katie returns for a second season on September 9.
