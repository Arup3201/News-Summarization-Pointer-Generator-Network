Now read Martin Samuel's column on Joe Kinnear's departure from Newcastle

The extent of the chaos that engulfed Joe Kinnear's reign as Necastle United's director of football has now emerged after the 67-year-old walked out on the role on Monday night.

The former Wimbledon manager left St James’ Park for the last time this week after failing to bring in a single permanent signing in two transfer windows.

The deterioration of his relationship with owner Mike Ashley brought his tenure to an end and Newcastle currently have no plans to replace Kinnear.

Sportsmail has learned that Kinnear’s role was causing divisions throughout the club.

On Saturday afternoon, following their third successive derby defeat by Sunderland, players refused to appear for the traditional Man of the Match award ceremony in a sponsors’ lounge.

When the message from the boardroom came that a player or member of the coaching staff had to appear in their stead, the reply was ‘send Joe Kinnear’. 

But the director of football, who had been verbally abused, along with Ashley, during the 3-0 home defeat, was not even at the ground. 

As a result of the stand-off, Newcastle ambassador and former captain Bob Moncur stepped in to appease sponsors for the event.

Further details were published by The Independent claiming the breakdown of Kinnear’s relationship with Ashley had forced his resignation on Monday evening.

The pair were seen at several games together this season laughing and joking and they had intended to attend the derby together but changed their mind following the sale of Yohan Cabaye to Paris Saint-Germain, and the anticipated backlash from supporters unhappy that Newcastle had failed to sign a replacement for the France midfielder.

One that got away: Yohan Cabaye left for Paris Saint-Germain and was not replaced in January

Really? Kinnear claimed he was closing on Mohamed Salah despite the forward already being a Chelsea player

That deal proved the final straw for Ashley because Kinnear agreed a fee for Cabaye. The pair clashed last week following the sale for less than the £25million Ashley expected, believed to be around the £20m mark.

It is also reported that Kinnear privately claimed Newcastle were going to sign Mohamad Salah last month for £25m after a deal had already been struck with Chelsea for less than half that figure.

The hierarchy at the North East club had grown tired of the way Kinnear operated.

How he told punters in the Hilton Hotel the night before Newcastle were beaten by Manchester City in January that he had £20m to spend on a striker, a boast that reached and infuriated Ashley.

How he struggled with technology, such as using the internet, and had endless problems with his mobile phone. 

How he claimed on a train earlier this season as he headed to watch a Newcastle match that he had to call off a drinking night with Bobby Moore to wine and dine the Supremes.

Brief: Kinnear's short-live spell as manager came to an end shortly after his shock appointment

How he told fans not to worry about selling Tim Krul because he had three world class goalkeepers lined up.

How he got the name of his own defender Shane Ferguson muddled up with former midfielder Stephen Ireland and called him Shane Ireland.

Sportsmail has learned that after watching a Birmingham City game, he asked Blues manager Lee Clark about one of his players. It turned out to be Ferguson.

Kinnear was appointed by Ashley as the replacement for departing managing director Derek Llambias last summer.

His appointment stunned supporters who thought they had seen the last of a manager who had been forced to quit through ill health four years earlier. That turbulent reign eventually led to Newcastle’s relegation from the Barclays Premier League.

That bad? Loic Remy (left) was brought in on loan but Kinnear failed to make a single permanent signing

Kinnear was brought in to oversee transfers and, after spending £33m last January on five French players, Ashley was eager to cut back on spending. And Newcastle spent just £2m on a loan fee for QPR’s Loic Remy.

Cabaye – or ‘Kebab’, as Kinnear had humiliating dubbed him in his first interview in his new job – was sold last week at a reduced price and it was Pardew who had to answer the uncomfortable questions. 

The Newcastle manager, who had no idea Kinnear had quit until he too heard the news late on Monday night, will have to answer more awkward questions when he meets the media on Thursday afternoon.

His hope is that he and chief scout Graham Carr will have more say in recruitment this summer. They are certainly all looking to move forward from another turbulent period in the club’s recent history.
