A father drowned trying to save his two teenage sons who were body surfing in strong waves.

The holidaymaker in his forties was on the beach with his wife when he saw the two boys being swept out of their depth and waving for help.

He dived in to help them but was carried off by the current at Rhosneigr Beach, Anglesey, North Wales.

A man was killed after reportedly going out to help two swimmers who had got into trouble near Rhosneigr beach on the west coast of Anglesey

The youngest son managed to clamber 
to safety onto rocks but the dad and the older boy, believed to be in 
his late teens, were swept away.

The pair were pulled from the sea and
 given CPR aboard a helicopter from RAF Valley, where Prince William is 
stationed, but the father could not be revived.

His son is in a critical condition at Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital, in Bangor, but said to be 'improving'.

The tragedy happened on Friday afternoon while the family from Manchester were holidaying in the area.

Locals said the two boys were bodysurfing - lying flat on the waves without a board and being swept in to shore.

A police spokesman confirmed an older man went into the sea after seeing the boys in need of help.

A spokesman said: 'The Coastguard was initially alerted to an incident whereby two men were in difficulty in the water.

'At this stage it is believed that a third man entered the water to assist and got into difficulties.

The damaged lifeboat called the Hereford Endeavour was 
named by Prince William and the then Kate Middleton on their first 
official engagement together

'He was airlifted by Squadron 22 of the RAF to Ysbyty Gwynedd where he was pronounced dead.

'Police inquiries are on-going in a 
bid to establish the full circumstances of the incident and are working 
with our colleagues in other agencies.'

A lifeboatÂ  was damaged when it 
rescued the younger son who had been swept on to rocks. He was taken 20 
miles by ambulance to the same hospital at Bangor with leg and other 
injuries.

Last 
night a spokesman for Trearddur Bay lifeboat said: 'What we were told 
originally was that a person had gone into the water and two others went
 to save him. Then all three got into trouble.

'It's a nice sunny day but nasty out at sea, with a 30mph wind and there was a big swell.

'When we got there the helicopter had
 already rescued two of them. The third man was on the rocks and one of 
the crew swam to him.

'We had to put the lifeboat against the rocks to take them off and there was some denting of the bow. Then we brought the lifeboat to shore and the man, who was in shorts, was taken off.'

The lifeboat, an Atlantic 85 type called the Hereford Endeavour was named by Prince William and the then Kate Middleton on their first official engagement together

It will be taken out of service while the damage, which also involves the hull, is repaired. The Sea King helicopter is based only minutes away from the scene at RAF Valley.
