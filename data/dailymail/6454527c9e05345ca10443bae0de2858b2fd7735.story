Thomas Eric Duncan is in critical but stable condition as his body battled Ebola

US Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan is now receiving doses of an experimental anti-viral drug as he continues to fight for his life in a Texas hospital.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital announced today that doctors had begun administering brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the disease.

The dug, developed by North Carolina-based Chimerix, is approved for the treatment of the herpes virus.

Duncan's doctors got permission from the federal government to use the drug after his condition took a dramatic turn for the worse. 

President Barack Obama on Monday announced that his administration was working on ways to screen travelers for Ebola before they enter the U.S. in an effort to prevent any other people from bringing the disease over from West Africa. 

Currently, travelers are only screened in West Africa before they leave the Ebola-stricken nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia. 

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said today that he is 'very confident' that America's largest city could quickly contain an outbreak of Ebola. The city has had at least two Ebola scares from ill travelers from West Africa, but lab tests show the patients did not have the disease.  

Physicians had initially said that his body couldn't handle anti-viral drugs in critical condition and that they were providing only 'supportive care.'

Duncan will not be receiving the 'miracle drug' ZMapp that cured American missionaries Dr Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol because there are no more doses of the serum left. The drug takes months to manufacture even very small quantities. 

Based on early-stage research by the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, brincidofovir has shown that it kills the Ebola virus in the same way it fights the herpes and smallpox viruses.

Chimerix and the FDA are working to finalize protocols to begin a clinical trial to determine whether the drug will work in Ebola patients. 

There is no proven cure for Ebola and currently the disease has a mortality rate of nearly 50percent.

The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved an emergency order allowing the drug to be given to Ebola patients. 

Cleaning up: Workers dress in full hazmat gear returned to the apartment where Duncan spent several days while contagious with Ebola and continued to sanitize it

Tagged and bagged: Workers brought out several items from the apartment. Duncan's girlfriend and her children were moved to a secret safe house 

The Cleaning Guys, a Dallas contractor, was given the job of cleaning up the apartment after Duncan's girlfriend revealed his towels and sheets - likely infected with the virus, were still in the home

A third drug, TKM-Ebola, from a Canadian pharmaceutical company, has also been approved for use in Ebola patients, though a study of whether it's safe to use in healthy people was put on hold after some people in the clinical study developed flu-like symptoms. 

Ashoka Mukpo, the NBC News cameraman who was diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia last week, arrived today at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, one of four special treatment centers for infectious diseases in the U.S.

Doctors there say they do no know yet whether he will be treated with any of the experimental medication.
