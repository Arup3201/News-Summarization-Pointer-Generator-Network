Was the turbulent reign of David Moyes at Manchester United necessarily his fault?

One researcher says he might have been doomed from the outset, owing to how Sir Alex Ferguson ‘over-achieved’ at the club.

But ultimately even science may not redeem him – the final straw was likely more to do with ‘politics than the performance of the club’.

Science behind the sacking? Research suggests David Moyes is the 10th greatest manager in the last 40 years of English football, so why didn't he survive at United?

The information is based on research by Dr. Stefan Szymanski, a Professor of Sport Management in the Department of Kinesiology at the University of Michigan.

For the last three decades he has been measuring the performance of managers against the wage spending of their club.

(Points according to Dr. Szymanski's data)

1. Sir Alex Ferguson - 549.9

2. Harry Redknapp - 398.9

3. Steve Coppell - 337.1

4. Alan Curbishley - 336.3

5. Arsene Wenger - 294.0

6. Dario Gradi - 277.9

7. David Bassett 277.4

8. Peter Reid - 269.0

9. Denis Smith - 268.8

10. David Moyes - 266.8

11. Graham Taylor - 266.3

12. Jim Smith - 263.0

13. Bobby Robson - 259.0

14. Tony Pulis - 254.4

15. Neil Warnock - 252.2

16. Ron Atkinson - 248.9

17. Howard Wilkinson 244.6

18. Howard Kendall 240.7

19. John Rudge 237.3

20. Kevin Keegan 236.6

...

117. Jose Mourinho 64.9

What he has found is that some can be regarded as underachievers – but more often than not managers overachieve.

The number of points a manager gets from a game from the data depends on the relative quality of the team and the opponent.

If the team’s wages are twice as high as the opponents then in a sense they are twice as good.

If the points actually won are greater than this expectation than they are attributed to the manager, which is how points are accumulated.

United, for example, won a lot under Ferguson simply because they had better players, says Dr. Szymanski.

But they won even more than predicted, so the extra points are credited to Ferguson.

This gives Ferguson a total score 549.9, putting him top of the pile.

In second is Harry Redknapp with 398.9 points.

For managers that have underachieved, they find themselves with minus points.

Ian St. John, manager of Portsmouth from 1974 to 1977, comes in last with a score of -37.4 thanks to a rather dismal win percentage of 25 per cent with the club.

Jose Mourinho, meanwhile, comes in at 117th, owing to him having a 'boatload of money' but not necessarily overachieving in his first stint at Chelsea.

The points so far, however, are based on provisional data and may still be revised.

Perhaps unsurprisingly Sir Alex Ferguson tops the list, and it may be this 'over-achievement' that meant even a manager with the previous stature of Moyes was not able to fill his boots

‘Basically
 my research has generally focused on the relation between team wage 
spending and performance,’ Dr. Szymanski tells MailOnline.

‘A lot of my research has a strong correlation between wage spending and performance.

‘We also looked at things like nationality, whether they were a player or not, where they played and so on.

‘Over time 90% of variation in league position can be accounted for by the wage spending of the club.

‘Ferguson’s obviously a great manager, but he did have a lot of money so you need to take out the impact the money effect had.

‘That’s what this methodology allows you to do.

'Ferguson was the biggest over-achiever over the period that he was manager.

'You could have predicted he would be successful with money, maybe top five in the league.

'However they didn't come in the top five every season, they won it more often than not.

'You can take the difference between what an average manager would achieve with the money and the actual achievement with Ferguson, the "Fergie difference" if you like.'

And it is possibly this 'Fergie difference' that ultimately led to the sacking of Moyes.

To compile the data, Dr. Szymanski studied every manager in all four divisions of English football from 1974 to 2010.

To qualify for the data a manager had to have been in charge for more than 30 games, which left a total of 528 managers.

While Fergie tops the list, perhaps as expected, it is the positions of others that are of most interest.

David Moyes, for example, comes in at 10th place thanks to his ‘success’ during his time at Everton.

This was due to him overachieving with only limited amounts of money available.

However, with his move to United Dr. Szymanski says he perhaps should have been a success at the club.

In the list Jose Mourinho came in at a lowly 117th after his first spell at Chelsea. According to Dr. Szymanski this is due to him failing to over-achieve with 'boatloads of money'

‘Managers that are successful in the data tend to be at on average several clubs,’ he says.

‘Is Moyes an outlier? It’s a matter of too few observations.’

‘I don’t think the number of games he was in charge at United is a good basis to judge his abilities as a manager.

‘I wonder if his sacking is not really more to do with politics than the performance of the club.’

He also points out that it may be difficult to update Moyes’ record as his stint at United was so brief.

‘We’re talking about tracking managers over tens of thousands of games over a 40-year period,’ he explains.

‘So one manager being fired on one day is not a very big event in our database.

‘What we’re trying to do is look what is generally true.

‘Moyes is a good manager and I think everybody acknowledges that.

‘He had tremendous success with Everton – my take is he wasn’t given a chance at United.

‘Surely he would need two or three years in the job to begin to assess if he could have done a job at the club in the long term.

‘Fergie went three years without winning anything.

‘What happened in the last year tells us nothing.’
