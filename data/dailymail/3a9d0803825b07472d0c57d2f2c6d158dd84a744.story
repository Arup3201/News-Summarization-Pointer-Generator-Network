England are ready to address defensive concerns ahead of the match with Ireland on Sunday week which could decide the RBS 6 Nations title.

Stuart Lancaster’s team will start the countdown to the Dublin encounter with the other unbeaten side in the championship by holding an inquest after conceding three tries at home to Italy.

Despite winning 47-17, England are well aware similar lapses in Dublin could shatter their challenge for another year.

Despite a strong start to the Six Nations, Stuart Lancaster knows his England side need to improve 

England followed up their 21-16 win over Wales with a 47-17 triumph against Italy on Saturday

But England were guilty of a slow start and Lancaster knows England cannot afford that against Ireland

Lancaster was asked if defence guru Andy Farrell will go ‘mad’ after seeing the English line being breached with alarming regularity.

Lancaster said: ‘I think he probably will. We were a bit soft on the edges. We pride ourselves on getting off the line and putting pressure on the opposition and we did that extremely well in the second half. We were just a bit slow out of the blocks. That reflected in the first try.’

Defensive shortcomings and another slow start were also raised by captain Chris Robshaw, who said: ‘We gave away a couple of soft tries.’

Asked to explain how England allowed Italy to score in the fourth minute, he added: ‘We were a bit passive defensively in the whole game. As soon as they got hold of the ball they made easy yards and Parisse got over in the corner. It’s an area to look at.’

Lancaster confirmed that full back Mike Brown won’t train this week as he is put through the return-to-play protocols after being carried off with concussion.

While he hopes to recover in time to face Ireland, Alex Goode of Saracens was described by Lancaster as ‘the next full back in line’ and he kicked 16 points as his club beat Aviva Premiership title rivals Bath 34-24 yesterday.

Ireland are bracing themselves for a titanic struggle after they held on to beat France 18-11. Scrum-half Conor Murray said: ‘We’re winning even though we’re not firing on all cylinders, but it won’t be good enough to beat England.’
