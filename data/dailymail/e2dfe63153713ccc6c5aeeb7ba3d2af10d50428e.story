A Florida man has hacked off his mother's head with an ax on New Year's Eve then dragged her body out to the garbage because she nagged him to do chores, police say. 

Christian Gomez, 23, confessed to beheading his mother Maria Suarez-Cassagne after a fight when she asked him to move boxes in the garage. 

Mario Gomez called 911 on about 7.30pm Wednesday and told dispatchers that his brother Christian had killed their mother and cut off her head, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said.

Deputies found Suarez-Cassagne's body outside the Oldsmar, Florida, home, near some garbage cans, according to the sheriff's office.

Christian Gomez was angry before the killing over his mother's wish he do some chores with boxes, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told The Tampa Bay Times.

Gualtieri also stated that the 23-year-old was jealous and believed his brother was his mother's favorite child.

Gualtieri said that Gomez spent two days plotting the slaying. Gomez used an ax multiple times in the decapitation, the sheriff told The Tampa Bay Times. 

Gomez placed his mother's head in a garbage can, and left her body outside after he could not place it inside the same can, Gualtieri also said.

'This whole circumstances is probably one of the worst that we've ever seen... It's terrible,' he told the newspaper.

Mario Gomez was under the impression he'd only overheard his younger brother moving the boxes, WFLA reported. 

Authorities said Christian Gomez had fled the scene - but he was arrested after another 911 call around 7:57pm reported a suspicious person riding a bicycle in the area.

Gomez confessed to killing his mother, according to the sheriff's office.

Authorities said investigators recovered the murder weapon - an ax. Mario Gomez, 27, was not injured. Pinellas County jail records did not show whether Gomez had an attorney.

Christian Gomez is a diagnosed schizophrenic, Gualtieri told WFLA.
