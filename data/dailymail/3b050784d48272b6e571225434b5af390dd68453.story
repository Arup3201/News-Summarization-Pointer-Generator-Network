Would you reveal your biggest regret in the name of art?

A young Romanian photographer took to the streets of  the UK and Romania to find strangers brave enough to confess their deepest, darkest secrets on camera.

Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi, 22, from London, captured people of all ages  in various locations  in a bid to explore ideas of human interaction and communication.

The girl on the left wrote: 'I regret that I forgot to take my baby doll with me today' and the boy (right) wrote 'I regret I do not have more time to play'

Standing straight clutching holding their signs, the unnamed subjects stare straight into the University of Portsmouth graduate's lens, allowing viewers to judge them and draw their own conclusions.

While some declared they had no regrets, others were much more forthcoming in their vulnerable state.

Alcohol addiction, theft and smoking weed were among the most explosive revelations from those keen to unburden themselves.

A young man with a smiling toddler in a pram confessed his drinking problem while a teenage wears the ghost of a smile as she admits stealing her sister's money.  

A couple now living in a British seaside town said: 'Our biggest regret is that we didn't move here many years ago. WE LOVE IT HERE'

A remorseful woman regretted not being able to help her child more and another wished she had different parents.

There were positive messages too though, with one elderly couple expressing joy at where they live, while a little girl simply wished she had brought her doll out with her. 

Alecsandra said of the project: 'This question has given to me the chance to have a profound connection between me and the interlocutor, thus managing to get into their soul and bring out a grinding they have for years.'

The girl on the left wrote 'Not having the confidence to be the best I can' and the girl hiding behind her sign wrote 'What I did last night'

This man regrets: 'Not saying "I love you!" enough' 

But while many people Alecsandra asked were happy to open up about their experiences, others flatly refused.

She said: 'It is true that many of the surveyed people had some abstention regarding their answers, and some of them said that it is too personal, but I had the chance to meet kind people to whom I could talk.'

The project was inspired by the work of Gillian Wearing, OBE, an English conceptual artist who was part of the Young British Artists' movement in the 1990s. 

Wearing uses photography and video to document the confessions of ordinary people and won the Turner Prize in 1997 for her '60 Minutes Silence' and 'Sacha And Mum' videos. 

This woman revealed that she regretted: 'That I did not have the right parents'

The man with the pram on the left confessed 'Developing an addiction to alcohol' and the man on the right wrote 'Not becoming a footballer'

Alecsandra believes that her project had the power to help the people she met, by helping them to offload their burdens. 

She said: 'I think that frequently when you share your thought with somebody, even if it is strange person, you release the black stain which is on the soul and you can feel free.

'I do not trust in people who say that they do not have regrets. 

'In my opinion, there is a difference between not having regrets and not thinking about them. 

'Not thinking about regrets is better, because what you have done is in the past.'
