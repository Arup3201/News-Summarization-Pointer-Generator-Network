A flood of aggressive 'demon shrimp' could wipe out native species in Britain as they spread through waterways across the country.

The shrimp, which kill and eat indigenous breeds, come from eastern Europe are thought to have been carried here in pools of water aboard large ships.

Experts have warned of the 'major threat' which the animals, just 1cm long, present to native ecosystems.

Aggressive: The so-called demon shrimp could wipe out stocks of native shrimp in some British waterways

Some scientists have warned that the shrimp could also spread diseases that could ravage other waterlife and change the character of entire ecosystems.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'Invasive shrimp such as this species present a major threat to the ecology of our rivers and lakes. We have a real battle on our hands to control their spread.

'These demon shrimp have been introduced into lakes in east Europe as fish food but they eat nearly anything.

'It's difficult to say exactly what the long term financial impact would be but, for example, they do eat mayflies and that will impact fly fishing.

'We also classify rivers by ecological status and these shrimp could alter a river's status - meaning we could have to invest money restoring ecosystems.'

Dr Alex Ford, a marine scientist from the University of Portsmouth, is investigating alongside the agency, and warned of the potential for 'demon parasites' clinging to the shrimps' bodies to damage British ecosystems.

Predatory: The shrimp kill and eat their native equivalents, and could also carry fatal parasites

Dr Ford, from the university's Institute of Marine Sciences, said: 'They are out-eating and out-competing our native shrimp and changing the species dynamic in our rivers and lakes.

'As soon as one species is depleted, it can affect the whole food chain with potentially catastrophic results.

'One of the main reasons why invasive species are successful is the escape from predators, parasites and disease in their native habitats.

'We are looking at whether these demon shrimp carry 'demon parasites', which could also affect our native species that won't have any immunity.

'There is a very real bio-security threat of spreading disease and parasites in native populations without acquired resistance.'

Demon shrimp can be found living underneath stones in rivers and have been replacing and mating with other amphipods.

It's not the first time a new species has taken over British waters.

American Signal Crayfish were introduced in the 1970s and have since eaten their way through British waterways - feasting on plants, invertebrates and small fish.

The six-inch long crayfish, which live for up to 12 years, carry a fungus which kills native crayfish, a protected species.

As a result, the Environment Agency has ruled that all non-native crayfish caught in British waters are to be destroyed.
