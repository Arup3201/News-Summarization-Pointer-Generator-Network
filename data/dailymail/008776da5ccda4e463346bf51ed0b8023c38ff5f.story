An Egyptian-born bodybuilder has just had his  31 inch biceps crowned the biggest in the world.

Moustafa Ismail, 24, has spent ten years pumping iron twice a day and his upper arms now have the same circumference as a grown man’s waist.

But despite his cartoon proportions he hates spinach.

The Eyptian-born bodybuilder eats three pounds of chicken, and a pound of steak or fish a day, as well large portions of carbohydrates

Instead 'Big Mo' eats as much as 3lbs of chicken, 1lbs of steak or fish and four cups of almonds washed down with two gallons of water and three litres of protein shakes.

The bodybuilder was so dedicated to bulking up his arms he moved his whole family to America to gain access to better workout equipment.

The body builder's arms measure a circumference of 31inches. But 'Big Mo' says  unlike Popeye he does not like spinach

Mr Ismail says he began bodybuilding to get fit and realised he enjoyed his arms getting bigger as he received more and more compliments

The muscle man said: 'People always say you remind me of Popeye the sailor man.

'This makes me laugh as the truth is I don’t have any spinach in my diet - I can’t stand the stuff.

'Actually I think my arms are now bigger than the cartoon character.'

Mr Ismail, who lives with his wife Carolina, started bodybuilding ten years ago in a bid to keep fit.

Namesake: But unlike the original Popeye (right) 'Big Mo' says he hates spinach, preferring his high protein, high carbohydrate diet. He can now lift an incredible 500lbs

But after hitting the gym he received hundreds of compliments on his bulging biceps and decided to concentrate all of his efforts on making them even bigger.

Five years ago, when he failed to win a place in the Egyptian bodybuilding team he swapped his home country for the USA.

He now trains at least twice a day and can lift an incredible 500lbs.

The gym fanatic admits to taking protein shakes to help with his bodybuilding but puts his bulging body down to genetics - his father was an Egyptian wrestler.

Mr Ismail moved himself and his girlfriend from Egypt to the U.S. purely so he could use better weightlifting facilities to pursue his aim of bulking up his arms

The Guinness Book of Records is launched today, with real life Popeye Moustafa Ismail promoting it

A minimum of three hours of training, at least twice a day

Daily diet includes:

He has a daily exercise regime of 5am until 8am during which he concentrates on cardio, strength-training and body sculpting, using heavy and light isolated weights.

When Mr Ismail is not pumping iron he’s pumping gas at the two petrol station he owns near his home in Massachusetts.

'Working out makes my mood better. You’re just focusing.

'And I like that in this type of sport you can see your improvement in your shape,' he says.

'I know they are growing, my chest, my shoulders, my arms. I love weights.'

Moustafa’s biceps have now been confirmed as a record and he will appear in the Guinness Book of World Records 2013, which is launched in London today.
