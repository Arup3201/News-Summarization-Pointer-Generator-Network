Lunatic: Jonathan Limani was jailed indefinitely after admitting cutting off his manager's head with a cheese knife because 'God told him to'

An Albanian immigrant who hacked a restaurant manager’s head off with a cheese knife was allowed to move to Britain despite five years of violent and psychotic behaviour in Europe.

Jonathan Limani, a paranoid schizophrenic described as a ‘highly dangerous individual’, had been sectioned twice and was being investigated for assault when he was allowed to move to England.

The family of his victim, Chris Varian, yesterday said authorities had made a ‘catalogue of errors’ in letting Limani move from Sweden to become a waiter at the four-star The Oxfordshire in Thame.

Limani, 34, denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter  by reason of diminished responsibility at Oxford Crown Court yesterday.

Limani – who had been working at the hotel for only a fortnight – killed his boss because the ‘voice of God’ had told him to, a psychiatrist told the court.

Mr Varian, then 32, had gone for a break to the smoking area. Limani took a cheese knife, followed him out and stabbed him before sawing his head off. Alan Blake, prosecuting, said kitchen porter Guy Hathaway-Pearce saw ‘the defendant kneeling on the ground holding Mr Varian’s neck’. Mr Varian was unconscious and Limani looked ‘transfixed’.

The decapitation had taken a ‘certain degree of time and energy’, according to the post mortem.

Limani pleaded guilty to manslaughter 
by reason of diminished responsibility, with the prosecution accepting 
he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing.

Limani had been sectioned twice and diagnosed with psychosis in Sweden and Switzerland. He was taking medication erratically. He served a year in prison in Switzerland for heroin trafficking in 2004. He was under investigation for assault in Sweden – where he claimed asylum – when he moved to Britain.

After his arrest here, he was detained in Broadmoor and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and a personality disorder.

Yesterday, Mr Varian’s father Nigel said his son’s death was ‘macabre’ and his family suffered ‘daily torture’. He demanded to know why the killer was allowed into the country.

Oxford Crown Court heard how Limani looked 'transfixed' as he sawed right through the restaurant manager's neck with a cheese knife (file picture)

‘He had a five-year history of 
psychotic violent behaviour,’ he said. ‘We hope the Government can take a
 serious look at this case. It seems so easy for this sort of thing to 
happen again.’

Judge Anthony King said Limani was a ‘highly dangerous individual’.

Sentencing him to life behind bars, 
with a minimum tariff of 19 years, Judge King said the killing 
of Mr Varian was an act of 'extreme and ultimate violence.'

'Extreme and ultimate violence': The killing took place at the Oxfordshire Golf Club near Milton Common, Oxfordshire, where both men worked

Before he can go to jail, Limani will 
be sent to a secure hospital for further psychiatric treatment. Should 
his mental health improve he will go to jail to serve his sentence.

The Home Office said Limani was not on its warning list when he was allowed to move to Britain.

Butchered: A post-mortem examination determined the cause of Chris Varian's death to be decapitation

Police officers discovered Mr Varian's
 body at a loading area at the rear of the £6million golf club, where 
Limani lived on site.

Limani was detained at the scene.

Limani, who had only been in the 
country for three weeks before butchering Mr Varian, was a known 
psychotic, having twice been detained for mental health problems in 
Sweden.

Less than a month before coming to the
 UK, the lunatic killer had allegedly tried to wrestle a handgun from a 
police officer as he was arrested over an assault.

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Tolmie
 said: 'Thames Valley Police has a duty to thoroughly investigate all 
incidents of this nature and present the facts together with the Crown 
Prosecution Service to a court.

'Every murder is by its very nature 
traumatic and very emotional for the family and friends involved but 
this particular case is horrific due to the level of injuries inflicted.

'This may be the end of the judicial 
chapter but as far as the family are concerned, their pain and loss will
 always remain. My thoughts continue to be with them at this very 
difficult time.'
