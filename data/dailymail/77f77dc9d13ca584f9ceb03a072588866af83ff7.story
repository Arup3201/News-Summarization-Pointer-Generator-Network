Sergio Aguero is looking forward to seeing Manchester City fan Menelik Watson in action for the Oakland Raiders against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley this Sunday.

The Argentine striker will be in attendance for the latest NFL International Series game to be played in London.

The 26-year-old will take part in Manchester City’s Premier League clash against Hull on Saturday before heading to London for the clash between the Dolphins and Raiders on Sunday.

The Raiders side features offensive tackle Watson, who was born in Manchester and in 2013 became the highest ever Brit to be selected in the NFL Draft, going to Oakland in the second round.

Aguero said: ‘I hope that Menelik Watson can do his stuff for the Raiders. I know he’s a big Manchester City fan and that he’s very keen to see us play at Wembley again.

‘I’m really looking forward to seeing the big NFL game at Wembley,’ the City striker added.

‘I’ve always been a big fan of the Dallas Cowboys, but love to watch the game and I’m excited about seeing the Raiders and Dolphins in action.’

The Cowboys will head to London in November when they take on the Jacksonville Jaguars in the third and final game at Wembley this season.

On October 26, the Detroit Lions will face the Atlanta Falcons in a 1.30pm kick-off - the first afternoon start since the International Series began in 2007.
