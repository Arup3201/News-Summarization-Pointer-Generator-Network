The 11-year-old boy found handcuffed to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck on Friday was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in Union Country by his foster parents, who were preventing him from running away.

Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'.

Steve Mills lives on land adjacent to that of the victims foster parents, Dorian Harper, an emergency room nurse, and Wanda Larson, a social worker, who have been charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment and animal cruelty.

The couple have been jailed and, at a brief court appearance Monday, their bond was set at $500,000 each.

The pair also have four adopted children aged from eight to 14.

Shocking conditions: Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper were arrested Friday after a sheriff's deputy found the shivering 11-year-old boy

All five have been placed in care 
outside Union County because Larson is a child protective services 
supervisor for that county's Department of Social Services.

She has recieved extra charges of willful failure to discharge her duty.

Neighbor
Mr Mills said in late July or early August a boy came running to his 
home 'crying and panicking and said ''Mister, can I have something to 
eat?''.'

As Mr Mills' wife went to fix a sandwich, the other boys arrived.

'They told me he was the newest one (and) said they were going to take him back,' Mr Mills told Charlotte Observer.

This boy 'was real small'.

Union County sheriff's office says it appears the 11-year-old boy found handcuffed to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck was routinely handcuffed in the home by his foster parents. Wanda Sue Larson (pictured) and Dorian Lee Harper were arrested and charged Friday after a happened to stumble across the boy

'He looked the smallest one out of the bunch. ... We just assumed he was kind of scared, (being in a) new house, new area, new siblings,' said Mr Mills.

Joyce Bigham, who lives across the street, told ABC News the five children 'dress like orphans' and that the 11-year-old boy 'looked pitiful'.

Another neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'.

'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn’t know where he lived,' she said.

The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich.

'It didn’t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said.

He told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind her house, the night before.

When she told him she would take him home, she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.'

Her daughter called 911 and a sheriff’s deputy came out, spoke with the boy, made a phone call, then told him she’d take him home.

'He didn’t refuse. He just went with her.'

The neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn’t been missing more than 30 minutes.

The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home.

'I know that’s where she took him (although) you can’t see the house from the road.'

Dorian Lee Harper was arrested Friday after a foster child was found cuffed by the ankle to his front porch in Monroe, N.C., with a dead chicken hanging from around his neck. Larson and Harper are charged with numerous offenses

Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'.

'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,'  he said.

'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.'

All the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza.

Authorities stumbled across the horrific situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch.

Dead: This lifeless chicken was found around the neck of a foster child who was handcuffed to the porch of his in Union County, N.C., on Friday. His foster parents have been arrested and charged with multiple offenses

He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch.

According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house.

Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. The children were removed from the home and are in the care of protective services outside of Union County.

'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday.

'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.'

Squalor: Authorities have described the Union City house as 'terrible', covered in feces, urine and garbage, and something 'you wouldn't want to walk through, much less live in'

Disturbing: The child services worker lives at this property with four adopted children and one foster child

Both Larson and Harper were charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment, and cruelty to animals due to the condition of some of their pets.

It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy. Whitaker said he could not disclose details from police interviews conducted as part of the investigation.

Larson and Harper remained jailed on Saturday. They each face charges of intentional child abuse that inflicted serious injury, false imprisonment and cruelty to animals, with the latter allegation based on the condition of some of the family pets, the sheriff's office said.

Larson also is charged with willful failure to discharge her duty as a public official and both are due in court on Monday.
