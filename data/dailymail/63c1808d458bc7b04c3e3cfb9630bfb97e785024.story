British holidaymakers have been warned of the dangers of wildfires which have forced thousands from their homes on the Canary Islands.

The Foreign Office yesterday told tourists and expats to take extra care because of the blazes raging in Tenerife and the neighbouring island of La Gomera.

Some 2,200 people fled their homes in the north west of Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands, as roads and power lines were cut off by the blaze. Hundreds of firemen continued to battle the flames from the air.

In La Gomera, at least 13 villages 
have been evacuated, with 5,000 people forced from their homes – a 
quarter of the island’s population.

Around 900 locals and tourists fled 
the island by boat on Sunday night as the town of Valle Gran Rey was 
evacuated amid fears it would be engulfed by flames.

Another 3,000 gathered at a port waiting to hear if they must also leave the island.

The Foreign Office updated its travel advice to warn: ‘There are reports of forest fires on the island of La Gomera.

'There are also reports of forest 
fires on the island of Tenerife. A number of local residents have been 
evacuated from the area as a precautionary measure and a number of roads
 are closed to allow access to emergency services.

‘Residents and visitors are advised to check the Canary government website for updates.’ 
Flights to the Canaries have not been affected, but some excursions on the islands have been cancelled.

Most of the 1.5million Britons who 
visit Tenerife each year stay in resorts along the south coast such as 
Los Cristianos and Playa de las Americas, which are at least 20 miles 
from the affected areas.

The firefighting task was being hampered by temperatures of up to 44C (111F), following the driest summer in 70 years.

The fire in La Gomera has destroyed 
7,400 hectares of land, including a large part of the Garajonay nature 
reserve, a Unesco World Heritage site.

Seven helicopters and three planes were being used to battle the blaze on La Gomera.

The head of the island's local government, Casimiro Curbelo, said they were facing an 'unprecedented' emergency and called for more help from Madrid.

Other fires were raging on the Spanish mainland. Two people, a firefighter and an environmental official, were killed battling a blaze in Torre de les Macanes, around 30 miles inland from the Costa Blanca resort of Benidorm, on the south east coast.

Two more firefighters injured tackling the same blaze were being treated in hospital.
