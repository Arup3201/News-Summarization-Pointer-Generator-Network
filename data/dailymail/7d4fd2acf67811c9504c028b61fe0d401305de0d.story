Trainer Dan Skelton has received a major boost after Value At Risk, one of the most promising horses in Ireland, was transferred to his care from the stable of troubled trainer Philip Fenton.

The five-year-old has won two of his five races and was one of three Fenton-trained horses tested and cleared by the BHA to run at the Cheltenham Festival in March as charges of possessing illegal medicines, including Anabolic Steroids, hung over Fenton.

Those charges have subsequently led to a guilty verdict on Fenton, who now faces a Irish Turf Club enquiry with his career in tatters.

Trainer Dan Skelton needs only one more win to match last term's tally of 27 successes

Fenton has already lost horses owned by the powerful Gigginstown Stud operation.

Value At Risk, owned and bred by England-based Marc Huglin, finished 13th to Super Concorde in the Champion Bumper when enduring a nightmare run. Subsequently he was third to Shaneshill in the Grade One Champion Bumper at the Punchestown Festival.

Skelton said: 'Value At Risk is very high calibre. We will be going novice hurdling with him and he has come in fit.

'We would like to get him out pretty soon so that if we want to go for a good novice hurdle later in the winter we can.

'The guy who owns and bred him is a bit nervous that the quicker spring ground is not really his cup of tea.

'So, although we have big novice hurdle aspirations in the spring, they would not be the be all and end all. We have one eye on chasing the following season.'

Skelton, in his second year with a trainer's licence, needs only one more win to match last term's tally of 27 successes after What A Warrior, ridden by brother Harry, landed the United House Gold Cup at Ascot on Saturday.

The success came seven days after the Skelton brothers combined to win the Silver Trophy Handicap Hurdle at Chepstow.

What A Warrior is now likely to run in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury where he could face Oliver Sherwood's Many Clouds, an taking winner at Carlisle yesterday.

Also Hennessy-bound is Rocky Creek, second to Road To Riches in the Champion Chase at Down Royal and trained by Skelton's old boss Paul Nicholls.

The champion trainer remains unperturbed by the disappointing fifth place of Silviniaco Conti behind Menorah in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby.

Nicholls said: 'He needs a test of stamina nowadays. He needed it a bit and was flat-out all the way.'

Silviniaco Conti and Jonjo O'Neill's Holywell, third to Many Clouds, went into the weekend joint favourites for the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

They now share that honour on 10-1 with both 2013 winner Bobs Worth and Champagne Fever. Title holder Lord Windermere is 12-1.

The prices reflect the open nature of the staying chase landscape.

Can Cadeaux go one better? 

Ed Dunlop’s Red Cadeaux, twice a runner-up in the Melbourne Cup, will make his fourth attempt to win Australia’s greatest race in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Gerald Mosse’s mount is one of 10 Europeans in a line-up which also includes Johnny Murtagh’s Ebor winner Mutual Regard and 2012 Irish Leger winner Royal Diamond. Shortest price of the raiders is Ryan Moore’s German-trained mount Protectionist.
