A girls' high school basketball match ended in confusion and controversy after the three referees ran off the court following a highly contested decision at the end of the game.

With a place in the state championships up for grabs, Celina trailed Argyle by just one point with 4.8 seconds left in the 3A Girls' Region II final, in Texas, when the incident took place.

Celina star Kynese Davis ran up the court and took on a final three-point shot, but was challenged and fell to the ground.

The whistle blew for what many, including both sets of players, believed was a foul, meaning Celina would have been presented with three free shots and an easy chance to win the match.

But as the Argyle players appeared to prepare to admit defeat, the three referees ran off to the side of the court and signalled the end of the game, much to the outrage of Celina players, coaches and fans.

At the end of the game Celina principal Bill Hemby asked for an explanation but the referees refused to comment to a tournament representative, leaving coaches unable to explain exactly what had just happened, WFAA.com has reported.

Celina coach Jordan Davis told the channel: 'To walk into that locker room and not be able to give them an explanation of what happened and some type of closure, that's probably one of the hardest things I've ever done.'

Video from the game suggests the referee 
puts his arm up for a foul, while footage captured by a WFAA 
photographer shows time was not up on the clock.

School officials complained to the University Interscholastic League (UIL) and asked for the opportunity to shoot the three free throws.

The Argyle Eagles ended up winning the game and getting through to the state championships following the controversial decision

The UIL however has said a protest based on the referee's decision 'will not be considered'.

A UIL spokesman told MailOnline: 'The call made by the officials at the end of the Argyle vs Celina girls basketball 3A regional championship final was a judgment call.

'According to section 1204 (q) of the UIL Constitution and Contest Rules, a protest based on a game or contest officialâ€™s decision will not be considered.

'Once the game is over UIL rules do not allow any type of protest based on an official's judgment or decision.'

Officials at Celina have said the UIL now needs to make changes in order to prevent a similar situation from happening again.

They have suggested officials should be required to explain decisions before leaving the court.

Mr Hemby said: 'Just prevent this from happening to anybody's baby's again - period; end of sentence.'
