Publicly shamed golfer Tiger Woods banned his ex-wife from smiling on the golf course, according to his former swing coach Hank Haney.

In a revelatory book he reveals the pro sportsman’s controlling attitude towards Elin Nordegren.

He claims Woods banned Nordegren from smiling on the golf course if he won, because he felt that he was ‘supposed to win’.

Controlling: Tiger Woods told his ex-wife she wasn't allowed to smile on the golf course if he won, according to former swing coach Hank Haney

Excerpts from the book, entitled The Big Miss, have been published in the new York Post.

In it Haney describes the relationship between Woods and his Swedish wife as being ‘calm, almost cool’.

Three months after the couple married, Nordegren apparently wanted to celebrate her husband’s victory at Torrey Pines.

She suggested they throw a party like they used to when she worked as a nanny for fellow golfer Jesper Parnevik.

But Tiger shot her down, saying: “E, that’s not what we do. I’m not Jesper. We’re supposed to win.’

Haney adds that the model’s smile ‘got smaller’ as their marriage continued. ‘In the future Elin would keep her emotions under wraps whenever Tiger won,’ he writes.

‘As life became more complicated, I thought Elin changed...She and Tiger developed a calm, almost cool relationship in front of other people, and conversations with them tended to be awkward and strained.

‘I never saw them argue, but they weren’t openly affectionate either.’

Haney goes on to write that during their six years together, Woods showed little respect for those around him.

He would make others pay for takeout and simply leaving a restaurant when he was done eating - whether or not those around him had finished.

Cold: When Woods went out to eat with Nordegren, he'd get up and leave, expecting her to follow, even if she hadn't finished her meal, the ex-coach claims

For months, Haney was afraid to ask Woods for a Popsicle when the golfer was heading to the refrigerator. ‘He never offered me one or ever came back with one,' he writes.

Written off: Woods called Haney¿s anecdotes 'one-sided' and a cheap way to earn money. 'I'm not going to waste my time reading it,' he said

He describes the anguish he felt over Woods’ simple lack of courtesy.

‘It actually took me a while to summon the courage to blurt out, “Hey, Bud, do you think I could have one of those Popsicles?”’

In the tell-all, Haney depicts Woods as bad-mannered, cheap, and a lover of pornography and potty-humour.

Before the 2006 Ryder Cup, several golfers, including devout Christian Zach Johnson, shared a hotel room with Woods.

Woods ‘immediately purchased the adult-move 24-hour package and turned it on,’ Haney said, according to the New York Post.

Johnson had no choice but to ignore the adult programming.

The ex-coach said Tiger let his fame go to his head.

When
 he went out to eat with Nordegren, he’d get up and
 leave, expecting her to follow – even if she hadn’t finished her meal.

‘When he was done – and he habitually ate fast – you were done,’ he wrote.

Though Woods said he hated the ‘vultures’ in media for picking apart his personal life, he oddly loved his South Park depiction, in which he is seen calling Nordegren a ‘fat Swedish cow.’

The coach quit via text message in May 2010 – perhaps a good move since he said Tiger was glued to his phone and would routinely ignore people to SMS.

As it turned out, the golfer was messaging his mistresses.

Woods has written off the book, calling it ‘unprofessional and very disappointing.’

He told ESPN.com in a telephone interview the book – which will be released prior to the Masters – was especially hurtful because ‘it’s someone I worked with and trusted as a friend.’

He called Haney’s anecdotes ‘one-sided’ and a cheap way to earn money.

‘I’m not going to waste my time reading it,' Woods said.

In the end, the 247-page book ends with Haney wishing Woods well – he even thanks him for ‘an incredibly rewarding six years.’
