The married lover of Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell has closed her Facebook account after suffering online abuse.

Blanca Fouche has received a torrent of abuse on the website from friends and relatives of her husband following the news of her relationship with the actor, it has been reported.

Le Vell, 48, faces trial in September after denying 19 sex charges, including six counts of raping a child, six allegations of indecently assaulting a child and seven counts of sexual activity with a child.

Mother-of-four Blanca, 31, has admitted dating the actor, but her South African husband Desmond, 33, is understood to have only found out after reading it online.

Now a relative of Desmond, who lives in South Africa, has told the Daily Star: 'It is fair to say she has received a fair amount of criticism from Desmond's people over here in Johannesburg.

'Quite a few relations and friends of Desmond have been on to Facebook to tell her what they think.

'It is no wonder she has closed her account.'

The relative said Desmond was 'in pieces' over his wife's relationship with Le Vell.

Earlier this month the actor, who plays car mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV soap, answered 'not guilty' to each of the 19 charges as they were put to him during a brief hearing at Manchester Crown Court.

The alleged offences relate to one complainant and all took place between 2001 and 2010.

News of Le Vell's relationship with Blanca, from Chile, also arose earlier this month.

She said she had admired the actor 'for a long time'. It was reported she met the actor when she moved in with a friends a few doors from his home in Hale, Cheshire.

She said: 'I’ve liked him from a distance for a long time.

The 48-year-old actor has played mechanic Kevin Webster on Coronation Street since 1983

'I’ve been seeing him for a few weeks. I always go to his place and I’ve been to the pub with him.

'We’ve held hands and walked down the street, we’ve been careful, but we’ve not been hiding. It’s just that there’s been no photographers here. I don’t want to say anything that might upset him. He’s told me not to say anything.'

Le Vell, whose real name is Michael Turner, split from his wife of 25 years, Janette Beverley, two years ago.

Le Vell, who last appeared in the Street on February 8, will not be seen in any more episodes until the trial is over.
