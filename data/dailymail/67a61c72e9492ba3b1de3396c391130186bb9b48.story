New York Giants player David Wilson came to the aid of a bird on Thursday.

Photographs showed Wilson carrying the bird in his hand while walking on the field in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Another snap revealed Wilson, 23, releasing the bird near a fence as he bent down and looked on to make sure it was okay.

Fansided pointed out that sports reporters Andrew Garda and Patricia Taina shared the story on social media.

Garda tweeted 'David Wilson just caught a bird at practice. Not like a badly thrown ball- an actual bird.'

Traina shared a photograph on Instagram of the bird perched on top of a camera, Fansided noted.

'David Wilson's bird paid the media a visit,' Traina's caption read.

Wilson is currently undergoing testing for a neck injury and received spinal fusion surgery earlier this year, NJ.com reported.

He now 'needs a miracle' to play football again, a source told the website.

Wilson played college football for Virginia Tech and was drafted by the Giants in 2012.

At the time Wilson was drafted, NFL.com reported that he signed a four-year contract with the team.
