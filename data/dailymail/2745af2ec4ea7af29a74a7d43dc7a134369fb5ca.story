A man accused of stabbing a 17-year-old girl to death in a Melbourne park allegedly went on a violent crime rampage in the hours before he handed himself into police.

Sean Christian Price, who has been charged with Masa Vukotic’s murder, has also been charged with six other offences including one count of rape, two counts of robbery and three counts of common law assault including an attempted carjacking.

On Thursday night the 31-year-old, from Albion, west Melbourne, faced an out-of-sessions court hearing, charged with murder after the teen’s brutal killing on Tuesday night.

His alleged crime spree on Thursday morning ended just moments before he handed himself in at Sunshine Police station at around 11.30am.

Price was remanded in custody overnight and will appear at the Melbourne Magistrate’s Court Friday morning.

Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia that along with Ms Vukotic’s murder Price has also been charged for the alleged physical and sexual assault of a woman and the assault and robbery of a 26-year-old man. Both alleged victims were taken to hospital.

Price has also been charged with attempting to carjack a vehicle belonging to a 77-year-old man in Sunshine in Melbourne's West. 

Price put on a show of defiance as he was driven into a Melbourne police station to answer questions about the murder of Vukotic on Thursday afternoon.

The man stuck up his middle finger and smiled as he arrived at St Kilda Police Station.

On Thursday afternoon, he wore a forensic jumpsuit and was in handcuffs as he arrived at the police station to be he questioned over Tuesday night's fatal stabbing in the affluent suburb of Doncaster.

Price handed himself into police around 11.30am just hours after detectives released CCTV of a man wearing a red T-shirt boarding a bus minutes after the attack.

Homicide squad detective Inspector Michael Hughes said the man was known to police but had no connection to Ms Vukotic.

Det Insp Hughes was unable to provide further information on the man as he was entitled to the due process but added the suspect had not been drug affected. He would not comment on whether or not a weapon had been found on the suspect.

Det Insp Hughes thanked the public for their assistance that led to the arrest.

Police are still investigating whether he has any links to the area where Ms Vukotic died, since the park is not easy to find.

'He was in the area. Was he there for sinister purposes? I don't know,' the detective said.

'We'll probably find out there is a connection to that location.'

Police were no longer looking for any other suspect, Det Insp Hughes said.

The breakthrough came after it emerged the suspect allegedly asked a man for directions near to where Ms Vukotic was found.

This comes after friends and family of the girl - who was known affectionately as 'Marci' - paid tearful tributes on Wednesday. 

Her boyfriend Tim Draper was accompanied by a friend as he knelt down and left a message among the growing pile of flowers and tributes left for his murdered girlfriend at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve.

He broke down in tears as the friend tried to console him. 

The heartbreaking letter began with: 'My dear love, you will always be in my heart', The Age reported.

'I know you're up there looking down and weeping. But please, my dear, holster those tears,' the letter read.

'She was a really smart and caring person, and she was a really caring person to me,' Tim told Daily Mail Australia.

The young man also paid tribute to Ms Vukotic, writing: 'I love you Maša Vukotic And i will always keep you in a special place in my heart. you rest easy now xxx [sic].'

The 17-year-old was murdered about 7pm on Tuesday while she exercising.

Detectives said the suspect had got on at Doncaster Road near the park at 7.09pm before getting off near the intersection of Hoddle Street and Johnston Street at Abbotsford.

He was captured carrying what looked to be a white plastic bag, which could possibly have carried the murder weapon.

A witness who was allegedly stopped by the suspect said he appeared nervous and seemed like he knew the answer to the question about directions.

'It was almost like he was trying to, I guess, lessen his suspicion,' Inspector Hughes told ABC radio earlier on Thursday.

He added they were also looking to get their hands on records from myki - the smart card ticketing system used in Melbourne. 

It comes as friends of the murdered Canterbury Girls Secondary College student paid tribute to their 'beautiful Princess Marci'.

'The world has certainly become a darker place without her,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia.

On Wednesday night, more than 100 mourners visited the crime scene, with her friends dressing in pink to lay flowers where her body was found.

'Marci was without a doubt one of the most wonderful people I've ever met,' a friend said.

'She was so full of personality and passion and her sense of humour was incredible.'

The 17-year-old's body was found by police along a walking track when a neighbour called triple zero after hearing screams and saw a man fleeing the scene.

She was in cardiac arrest when she was found, but paramedics were unable to save her and she died at the scene. 

Earlier on in the investigation, police released CCTV footage of a man running from the crime scene carrying a plastic bag and arrested a man who allegedly matched that description on Wednesday afternoon.

But he was released after being questioned and is no longer a suspect. 

Ms Vukotic has been described as a bright girl who knew three languages and was focussed on her dream of becoming a lawyer.

'It's such a shame she'll never reach those dreams now,' a friend said.

'She never let anything or anyone stand in her way. She was passionate and driven and I love her very much.'

Her friends are organising a memorial picnic at Queen Victoria Gardens in Melbourne on March 28 to be called 'Princess Marci's Royal Picnic'.

'I can only wish her self confidence and will to learn inspires others and her memories live on for the years to come.'
