X Faxctor judge Nicole Scherzinger’s decision to hide her eating disorder caused tensions which contributed to her former band splitting up, it was claimed. 

Miss Scherzinger, now a soloist, spearheaded The Pussycat Dolls to international success, selling more than 50million records, before they split in 2010.

But former bandmate Carmit Bacher said Miss Scherzinger, 34, damaged relationships within the all-girl group by failing to confide in them about her battle with bulimia, a fact she made public in a interview only last year.

Tensions: Singer Carmit Bachar said the Pussy Cat Dolls split because of tensions caused by Nicole Scherzinger's secret eating disorder

Split: The Pussy Cat Dolls broke up in 2010

According to Miss Bachar, 38, who was
left feeling ‘stupid’ for missing the signs of the illness, it 
made Miss Scherzinger fractious.

She also blamed the split on Miss Scherzinger’s ambitions for a solo career. Miss Bachar was in London for the Pulse dance tour.

Miss Scherzinger, 34, who is in a relationship with British Formula one Champion Lewis Hamilton, has  become known as the sweet natured, slightly goofy, X Factor judge.

But as a Pussycat Doll she was ruthlessly ambitious, career driven and prone to mood swings, Miss Bachar said.

And her eating disorder, which was revealed last year, made her erratic and temperamental.

Miss Bachar, 38, said: ‘It’s quite scary but obviously that can affect you deeply, emotionally obviously there are things there that need to be dealt with too but we were working so hard so we didn’t think.’

Disorder: She admitted in an interview last year that she had suffered from bulimia

Miss Bachar, who had a successful 
solo career before joining the Pussycat Dolls, was the oldest of the six
girls and prided herself on being the one the others could turn to.

She
was the Vida Loca girl for Ricky Martin, had danced on stage with 
Beyoncé and described herself as being a ‘mumma hen’ to the younger 
Dolls.

But she missed 
the signs of her friend’s illness and as she spoke about their 
relationship for the first time she said she felt ‘stupid’ because of 
it.

‘I might be stupid and oblivious to things, but I didn’t see any of that,’ she said. 

‘Obviously people who have disorders like that are very good at hiding it. I feel stupid though not knowing. We were so close and I was shocked. I thought how could you hide that?

‘We would go out together, go to dinners, label dinners, and we’d all eat and I mean when do you have time to do that? I don’t understand it.’

Success: Miss Scherzinger has gone on to have a solo career and become a judge on the X Factor

Boyfriend: The singer is dating British Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton

Miss Scherzinger, who is known for 
her impeccably toned figure, has in the past put her slim frame down to 
an exercise regime that included long runs several times a week as well 
as regular circuit training and dance sessions.

But last October she admitted she had suffered from bulimia on an episode of VH1’s ‘Behind The Music’.

She described it as ‘my addiction’ and said she had felt too embarrassed to open up about it sooner.

Miss Bachar made her comments during her time in London for the Pulse dance tour (Subs, please leave), said: ‘She’s ambitious and she’s driven and she wanted to have her solo career. We were made very aware of that.

‘I was never thinking about a lead, to me a group is a group, so I thought it was gonna be more of like all of us.

‘We didn’t think it was going to veer to being as much of Nicole as it did. We thought of her as being the lead vocalist and spearheading the situation but then it really became a separation between us.’
