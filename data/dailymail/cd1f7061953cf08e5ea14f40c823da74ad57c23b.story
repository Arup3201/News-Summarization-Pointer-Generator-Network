The threat of more landslides loomed over central Indonesia today as rain forced rescuers to halt their search for survivors from a village swamped when a hill collapsed.

Seventeen bodies, including those of four children, were recovered today from the disaster-hit village in Central Java, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.

Fifty-two people were still missing, three days after Friday's disaster. The confirmed death toll now stands at 56.

More than 3,000 rescuers, including soldiers, police and volunteers, dug through the mud and wreckage after the landslide buried more than 100 houses in Jemblung village in Central Java province's Banjarnegara district.

Residents of the remote farming village said they heard a roaring sound just after dusk on Friday followed by a rain of red soil.

Some managed to flee to safer ground, while others were either at home or in the local mosque when mud, rocks and trees tumbled onto their village.

The search for the missing was halted on Monday as rain prompted fears of another mudslide. Local army chief Lieutenant Colonel Edy Rahmatullah said it would resume on Tuesday.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who visited the area Sunday, pledged to relocate hundreds of people left homeless by the disaster and promised government aid for the injured. Eleven villagers are in hospital.

Local resident Subroto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, described the moment of the disaster. 'The landslide looked like it was spinning down. I managed to rescue a pregnant woman, but could not save the other man,' he said.

He said one side of the hill collapsed and then another. 'In five minutes, there were three (major landslides) and they swept away everything,' he said.

Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said 577 people from the surrounding areas had been taken to temporary shelters

Mr Nugroho yesterday said 577 people from the surrounding areas had been taken to temporary shelters.

'We hope we can operate all of the heavy equipment today,' Nugroho told Reuters. 'We could not operate the equipment soon after the landslide. We had to be very careful about the stability of the ground.'

Mr Nugroho said on Saturday that some rescuers heard what sounded like calls for help coming from the debris, but they did not have equipment to dig.

'Mud, rugged terrain and bad weather hampered our rescue efforts,' he said. Tractors and bulldozers were later brought in.

Indonesian rescuers search for victims after the landslide hit. More than 2,000 people were involved in rescue efforts. Millions of people in the country live in mountainous areas or near flood-prone plains close to rivers

'It was like a nightmare. ... We suddenly heard a terrible roar and we were immediately fleeing from the rain of red soil,' said Wahono, a resident who survived with four family members. 'Many failed and they were buried in the ground.'

Wahono said he heard people screaming and pleading for help in the heavy rain and darkness. But he said he was unable to do anything other than run with his family to safety.

The landslide was the second in several days on densely populated Java island. Mud and rocks hit Central Java's Wonosobo district on Thursday, killing at least one villager.

Seasonal rains and high tides in recent days have caused dozens of landslides and widespread flooding across much of Indonesia, a chain of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood-prone plains close to rivers.
