It was the label that she chose for the biggest day of her life in April 2011 and has returned to on many occasions, particularly in recent weeks during the royal tour.

And now, the work of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite designer, Alexander McQueen, will be exhibited in all its glory.

The V&A will present Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty in London in spring 2015 - the first and largest retrospective of the late designer's work to be presented in Europe.

Firm fan: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured meeting fans in Adelaide, is a huge fan of Alexander McQueen and has chosen the label countless times for some of her most important events

Spanning from his 1992 MA graduate collection to his unfinished A/W 2010 collection, the V&A promise that McQueen's designs will be presented with the dramatic staging and sense of spectacle synonymous with his runway shows.

The original version of Savage Beauty at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York in 2011 was organised by the Costume Institute and became one of the Museum's top 10 most visited exhibitions - so London is hoping for the same.

Tragic: Alexander McQueen, left, pictured with milliner Philip Treacy, hanged himself in February 2010 - a huge loss to the fashion world

'London’s where I was brought up. It’s where my heart is and where I get my inspiration' said Alexander McQueen in 2000, ten years before he tragically took his own life.

Speaking about the enfant terrible of the fashion world whose talent for design has been lauded across the globe, Martin Roth, V&A Director, said: 'Lee Alexander McQueen was brought up in London, studied here and based his globally successful McQueen fashion brand here - by staging the exhibition at the V&A it feels like we are bringing his work home.'

Sarah Burton, Creative Director Alexander McQueen, the late designers business partner and mastermind behind Kate Middleton's wedding dress, said: 'Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.

Most famous design: Sarah Burton, Creative 
Director of Alexander McQueen, who designed Kate's wedding dress, said that
 the upcoming exhibition is a celebration of the most 'imaginative and 
talented' designer of our time

She just loves his designs! Kate wore more McQueen than any other label over the last few weeks on her Royal Tour of New Zealand and Australia, left, and famously at the evening reception following her wedding, right

'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired. He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless.'

From humble East-end beginnings, 
McQueen catapulted through life from the 21st floor of a council flat as
 an obstinate 16-year-old embroider (one who stitched the phrase ‘I am a
 c***’ on a jacket designed for Prince Charles) to an inexorable 
household name.

Describing
 his childhood as ‘troubled’, McQueen came out as gay at the age of 18 
armed with an often foul mouth and offensive humour, often 
incorporating themes such as death, masochism and violence into his 
fantastically original collections.

He
 is also known for having worked as chief designer at Givenchy from 1996
 to 2001. The designer hanged himself in February 2010.
