The parents of a young aristocrat who claim their son was killed by police in Kenya have called a report into his death paid for with British foreign aid 'a shameful whitewash'.

Former Marlborough schoolboy Alexander Monson, 28, died in May 2012, hours after being detained on suspicion of smoking cannabis in the coastal resort of Diani.

Last week his mother, Hilary, 60, was told by the country's Independent Policing Oversight Authority – set up with money from the UK's £125 million annual aid to Kenya – that her son died from a drugs overdose.

However, his father, Nicholas, the 12th Lord Monson, said autopsy reports show his son had no drugs in his body and had suffered 'blunt force trauma' to his head and self-defence injuries.

He said: 'The report is a shameful whitewash. I have been given the names of my son's killers, who are Kenyan police officers.'

Alexander's sister, Isabella, 28, said: 'My mother sat open-mouthed as she was read this report. She told them: 'You should be ashamed of yourselves.' We just want answers.'

Alexander died of a massive blood clot on his brain after being taken to hospital for treatment.

According to local police, he was about to be interviewed in custody when he complained of feeling sick and was taken to hospital. 

His mother, who was with him when he died, says he was handcuffed to the hospital bed.

A family spokesman said he was told by hospital doctors that police brought him in claiming he had overdosed. 

The damage to his skull was revealed only during the autopsy, which also found he had not overdosed. 

Described by his father as a ‘golden boy’, Alexander had a degree in psychology from London’s City University and went on to study at Chelsea Art College where he gained a scholarship.

Mr Monson lived in London but spent much of the year in Kenya with his mother and sister, who run the Four Twenty South complex of self-catering cottages in the Indian Ocean resort of Diani.
