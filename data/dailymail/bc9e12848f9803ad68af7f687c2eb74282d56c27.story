Tomas Berdych bounced back from a poor start to his ATP World Tour Finals campaign by beating out-of-form Marin Cilic in straight sets on Wednesday.

Berdych had won just two games in his opening match against Stan Wawrinka on Monday but was in far better form as he beat Cilic 6-3, 6-1 in one hour and 14 minutes.

The Czech now goes top of Group A for a brief period, with the winner of Wednesday night's match between Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic guaranteed to overtake him.

Like Berdych, Cilic had only managed to claim two games in his opener against Djokovic and the Croat also admitted prior to the tournament that he had still not fully recovered from a right arm injury.

The first game was packed with unforced errors from both but Berdych still managed to claim the instant break as Cilic netted with a forehand.

US Open champion Cilic continued to struggle and Berdych broke again to wrap up the first set in 42 minutes.

Things got no better for Cilic in the second set as he misfired with a backhand to hand the break to Berdych for 3-1.

Another dreadful service game gave Berdych the double break and the chance to serve out the match and the world No 7 made no mistake.

Although Berdych has never won his opening match at the season-end championships in five attempts, his win against Cilic remarkably keeps up his streak of always winning his second match.

Australian Open champion Wawrinka will now take to the court later knowing that victory will book his semi-final place, while world No 1 Djokovic cannot guarantee qualification tonight even if he wins.
