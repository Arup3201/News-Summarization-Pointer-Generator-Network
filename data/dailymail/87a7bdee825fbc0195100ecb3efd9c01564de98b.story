For almost 100 years, Cadbury’s chocolate has been swathed in a distinctive purple wrapping that made it stand out from rivals.

But yesterday it lost the exclusive right to the iconic colour in a court battle with Nestle.

Following the ruling by the Court of Appeal, trademark lawyer Fiona McBride said: ‘This is a  massive blow to Cadbury.’

Cadbury has lost the exclusive right to use its iconic purple colour on chocolate bars after a bitter court battle with Swiss rival Nestle

Cadbury chocolate has carried its distinctive purple colouring since 1914, when it was adopted as a tribute to Queen Victoria

Today's decision opens up the possibility that rivals could launch a host of copycat products

The firm wanted to trademark the colour 
Pantone 2865c – introduced in 1914 as a tribute to Queen Victoria – but 
failed in a test case brought by its Swiss rival.

While the challenge to Cadbury was brought by Nestle, the impact is that any supermarket or rival could now use ‘Cadbury purple’ on their products.

The decision opens up the possibility that rivals could launch a host of copycat products to try and cash in on the success of the Dairy Milk bar and other products, such as Crispello and Heroes.

The decision was announced by the Court of Appeal today and came as a shock after Cadbury had won its case at all earlier stages of the legal battle.

Following a victory at an earlier stage, a spokesman said: ‘Purple is a colour that has been used by Cadbury for more than 100 years - the colour has always been associated with Cadbury.

‘Purple was Queen Victoria's favourite colour and the Cadbury brothers were loyal supporters of the Queen. We have gone to great lengths to guard our trademark rights and … We have been looking to protect the colour for years..

Cadbury was given a royal warrant by Queen Victoria in February 1854 - making the company the official cocoa and chocolate makers for the monarch.

Among its adverts from that era is one showing Victoria drinking Cadbury's Cocoa while sitting in a train.

The
firm first introduced the purple - her favourite colour - in 1914 as a tribute to her and it 
has identified its products on sweet shop shelves ever since.

Cadbury Dairy Milk started out in pale mauve with a red script.

The full Dairy Milk range became purple and gold in 1920.

The Cadbury family were one of the 
driving forces of philanthropy in the late stages of the Victorian era, 
when society grew more reflective on what had been an age of growing 
social and economic division.

The
industrial revolution had driven prosperity and attracted millions of 
people to the cities in search of work.

Yet millions of those workers 
lived in abject poverty as characterised in the works of Charles Dickens
and other authors.

As Quakers, the Cadbury family 
believed tea, coffee and cocoa beverages could serve as an alternative 
to alcohol, seen to be a cause of poverty and deprivation among the 
working classes.

The
Bournville factory was built in 1879 and, in 1893, as part of the 
company's altruistic vision, saw the creation of a 120-acre village of 
better housing for its workers.

However, the company founded in Bournville, Birmingham, and controversially taken over by Kraft of the USA in 2010 in a deal worth £11.5billion will now have to think again.

The holding company for the famous British brand is now called Mondelez.

The court case turned on a technicality and whether the language used by Cadbury in an application to trademark the colour had been clear.

The three Court of Appeal judges decided it had not and therefore denied the confectionary company’s attempt to claim exclusive use of it.

In the past, Nestle has been accused of undermining Cadbury products with its Quality Street My Purple chocolate bar, which had a similar wrapper.

A spokesman for the firm said: ‘We welcome the Court of Appeal’s decision to uphold Nestlé’s objection against Mondelez’s proposal to trade mark its Dairy Milk ‘Purple’ colour across a broad range of products. We believe this was the right outcome from a legal perspective.’

Cadbury insisted that even if it does not have exclusive use of the particular shade of purple, it will take action against anyone who tries to copy or pass off their products as looking like Dairy Milk.

A spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed by this latest decision but it’s important to point out that it does not affect our long held right to protect our distinctive colour purple from others seeking to pass off their products as Cadbury chocolate.

‘Our colour purple has been linked with Cadbury for a century and the British public has grown up understanding its link with our chocolate.

‘We are studying this particular ruling and will consider our next steps which includes the possibility of an appeal.’

Fiona McBride, partner and trademark attorney at Withers & Rogers, said: ‘This is a massive blow to Cadbury and has made it even more difficult for brand owners to obtain trade mark protection for use of a colour.

‘Seeking colour protection has never been easy or straightforward – it is necessary to demonstrate that consistent use of a specific colour over a period of time has led it becoming recognised as synonymous with the brand.

'With a heritage dating back to the 1920s, Cadbury had hoped that it had been using the colour purple for long enough.'
