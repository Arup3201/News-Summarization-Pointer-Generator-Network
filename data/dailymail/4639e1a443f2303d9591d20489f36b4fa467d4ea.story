The running out of Jos Buttler at Edgbaston was absolutely fine. I have no problem with it. There is no ‘Spirit of Cricket’ issue for me.

Sachithra Senanayake had clearly warned Buttler about backing up too far - and according to the laws he doesn’t have to do that - and it doesn’t matter that he wasn’t charging down the pitch. The England man was out of his ground.

Of course it was an unsavoury scene and everybody involved in the game would have wondered what they might have done. What you need is a strong captain who is able to step back and take the heat out of it.

Controversial:  Sachithra Senanayake appeals to the umpire for a run out of Jos Buttler at the non strikers end

If it had been me in Angelo Mathews’ shoes, I might have gone up to the batsman and said, ‘Look, you’ve been warned and you’ve done it again. You have put me in a really difficult situation here because you are out. I might just give you one more chance but if you do it again I’m sending you packing.’ 

I don’t blame Mathews for not doing that but he could have bought himself time by having a look round at his senior players, because there was a lot of experience out there in former captains Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillekeratne Dilshan. But he decided to make the call himself and that’s fine.

Things had been a bit tasty out there from the start, with the Sri Lankans questioning the umpires’ calling of wides.

They looked like a team who had a bit of an issue - and perhaps the reporting of Senanayake for a suspect action was the key to what happened on Tuesday.
