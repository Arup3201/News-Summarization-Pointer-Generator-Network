Allegations: Film director Lynne Ramsay is being sued by the producers of Jane Got A Gun

An award-winning film director is being sued for almost £500,000 after failing to turn up for work on a big-budget movie.

Lynne Ramsay quit the blockbuster Western starring Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor the day before filming was due to begin in March.

Now the producers of Jane Got a Gun have begun legal action in the US against her.

They are demanding that she return the $750,000 fee (£466,000) paid to work on the screenplay and to direct it.

The action alleges that Ramsay – who was Bafta-nominated for We Need to Talk About Kevin, which starring Tilda Swinton –  was in breach of contract by not appearing on set in New Mexico, as planned. She is also accused of being drunk and disruptive.

The movie project descended into farce when the 43-year-old Glasgow-born director was followed off the troubled production by actor Michael Fassbender, who was then replaced by Jude Law.

However, Law later walked away from the project as did American actor Bradley Cooper, who quit a short time afterwards.

According to one report, Ramsay had not been presented with an approved schedule, script or budget days before shooting was due to begin.

Scottish actor McGregor was eventually drafted in to replace Law, while Warrior filmmaker Gavin O’Connor signed up to direct the movie.

According to the lawsuit, Ramsay was reportedly paid around £500,000 to re-write the script and direct the picture.

She has previously worked on the movies Ratcatcher and Morvern Callar, both of which were set in Scotland.

According to court papers submitted in Albuquerque, New  Mexico, problems with Jane Got a Gun developed in February and March before filming was due to start. The lawsuit claims Ramsay failed to deliver a script, delaying the movie.

They allege that she was 'repeatedly under the influence of alcohol, was abusive to members of the cast and crew, and was generally disruptive'. 

The producers are asking that she repay the money and are seeking punitive damages over claims of fraud and breach of contract.

Director Gavin O’Connor said production had been delayed for three days to replace Ramsay.

Joel Edgerton, one of the movie’s other stars, said the cast decided to complete the film.

He added: ‘The producers decided they were going to be the guys playing the violin on the Titanic, that they were going to keep playing. That was kind of infectious.’

Jane Got a Gun is expected to be released in the US next year.

Ramsay was unavailable for comment yesterday.
