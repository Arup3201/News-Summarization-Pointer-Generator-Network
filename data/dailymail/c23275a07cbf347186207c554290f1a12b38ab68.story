It's a Christmas tree like no other.

Towering at 7ft tall, the creation was put together by takeaway bosses John and Corrine Clarkson.

The Chippy Tree is made from 50kgs of potatoes, 20 loaves of bread and 22 baps, and is on display at Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire. 

The 7ft high Christmas tree is made from 50kgs of potatoes, 20 loaves of bread and a further 22 baps. It is the brainchild of takeaway boss John Clarkson (pictured) who runs Mister Eaters in Preston, Lancashire 

The couple, who were also behind battered Spam doughnuts and the world's tallest burger, made the creation to spread festive cheer.

After taking a photo, the takeaway bosses decided to hand out their sandwiches to punters free of charge. However, interested customers could buy the work of art for £160. 

The tree stands so tall that 54-year-old Mr Clarkson had to forgo the star on the top. 

Mrs Clarkson, 50, said: 'We always like to do something a little bit unusual, and we had a good vibe about this. 

Christmas treats with a twist: Corinne Clarkson with Mister Eaters Eating Emporium's battered mince pies

'We were trying to think of a catchy names for it but is is basically a Christmas-tree shaped chip butty. 

'It's common place to do battered Christmas mince pies and puddings now and so we thought we would put that on its head but still do something in keeping with festivities.

'When making it we had to act quick - we were really busy shovelling the chips into the butties, it took an hour to build. We would have gone higher but it would have gone through the ceiling.

'The customers are not shocked by what we do anymore. They like it and enjoy seeing what we'll come up with next.' 

The couple are famous for their wacky culinary creations including battered Spam doughnuts (pictured)

Record-breaking attempt: The Pie-scraper was created earlier this year and stood up at 5ft 4inches tall. It was filled with bacon butties, pies, pizzas and spaghetti Bolognese 

'It's definitely not your standard chip butty like what we usually sell for £1.85. I think people felt a bit bad eating it because it looked so amazing stood next to the window for everyone to see. It's been a real success in the run up to Christmas.'

But Mrs Clarkson is reluctant to reveal how the potato tree keeps vertical.

'It's not got a rod down the middle like most people think but there is a support system in place. 

'A lot of preparation goes into it before it is built and John is the creative one. We did decide to steer clear of sauces though just in case it got a bit too messy.'
