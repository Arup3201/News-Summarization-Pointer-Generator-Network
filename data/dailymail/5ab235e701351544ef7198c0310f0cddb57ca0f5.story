Baby ban: The 2012 organisers have said every child, including babes-in-arms, must have their own ticket

Mothers could be allowed to take their babies to the Olympics after organisers signalled they would reverse a controversial policy effectively banning newborns.

Thousands of parents had complained about a rule stating that every child – including babes in arms – must have their own ticket.

With 16 months between the first wave of ticket sales in April last year and the start of the Games, many ticket holders have welcomed additions to their families.

But they were told they would not be able to simply bring their babies along – even though the infant would not be using a seat.

Even if parents subsequently attempted to buy a ticket for their child, there would be little point as the seats would not be together.

Yesterday, however, Labour’s Olympics spokesman Tessa Jowell – who sits on the board of organisers Locog – pledged that the committee was ‘trying to find a solution’ to ensure families and mothers with new babies could still attend events.

‘What seems to have happened is that 
mums have had babies since they bought their tickets and have been led 
to understand that they would have to buy a ticket for their little 
baby,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s World at One.

‘I talked to Locog about this. This is
a problem that they intend to solve so that wherever it is conceivably 
possible, little babies will go to the Games with their mums. This is an
expression of our determination that this is a real family Games.

Computer hackers will try to inflict havoc on the Olympics by attacking the official Games websites and those of its major sponsors, the Home Secretary warned yesterday.

Theresa May predicted the threat level for a terrorist attack on London 2012 will be ‘severe’ – meaning a plot is ‘highly likely’.

She said in addition to physical attacks, there was ‘a strong possibility’ of a ‘threat from cyber-crime’. Malicious computer experts – known as ‘hacktivists’ – could target the security and ticket systems, she warned.

‘We are aware of the threat from so called “hacktivist” groups,’ Mrs May said. ‘These groups may attempt to target the Games and may also attack the websites of high-profile sponsors associated with the Games.’

‘They are on this problem now and 
looking to solve it now. They will be in touch with everybody who this 
might apply to as soon as they can be.’

Miss Jowell conceded it may not be 
possible to bring small children to all events. But she insisted that 
Locog was ‘focused on finding a solution’ to the problem immediately 
rather than in April, when a fresh wave of ticket sales begins.

The suggestion of a U-turn comes as 
the independent Equality and Human Rights Commission warned that new 
parents who wanted to take their babies to the Games could have a case 
for sex discrimination if they were prevented – because the rules were 
likely to affect more women than men. 

Since news of the ticket policy 
emerged, many parents have told on social networking and parenting 
websites of their misery at being unable to attend events.

The problem particularly affects those
who live outside London and the South East, where a visit could 
potentially involve an overnight trip, making childcare difficult.

One mother said: ‘I live in Shropshire and had planned to go with my two children and husband.

‘I have fallen pregnant since I bought
the tickets but as I want to breast-feed – unless I can bring the baby 
we just won’t be able to go. It’s ridiculous.’  

At Lord’s cricket matches, babies and toddlers under three go in for free, while Wimbledon recommends babies are not taken.

Children under five are allowed in without a ticket – but may not enter Centre Court or the other show courts.

At Twickenham Stadium, children under 
two do not require a ticket but must be securely strapped to an adult 
sitting in the lower tier of the stands.

One woman on Mumsnet said she is likely to miss out on the Olympics as a result of the policy.

She said 'it does feel like discrimination', adding she has four tickets for sailing.

'We will apparently need another ticket for a baby not even born yet and certainly not conceived when we bid for tickets.'

She said she would bid for another ticket but did not hold out much hope.

'If I cannot get another ticket, then it looks as though the baby won't be able to go and so neither will I.

Outrage on Mumsnet: 'If I cannot get another ticket, then it looks as though the baby won't be able to go and so neither will I'

'I normally keep well clear from the 
breast v bottle discussions, but this does feel like discrimination 
against those people who are breastfeeding.

'And those unable/unwilling to leave a very small baby in the care of someone else.'

Another woman said she objected to the
fact that she needed 'to get another ticket that in all probability 
won't exist... Stopping me and potentially my family from going.

'It 
will be a while until I know if I can even get another ticket (April, 
provided the website is working by then), regardless of the cost, and 
probably too late by then to be able to re-sell any tickets we are 
subsequently unable to use.'

Another 'fuming' pregnant woman wrote on Mumsnet: 'I’m shocked by the conversation I just had with the London 2012 ticketing people.

'My
husband and I were lucky enough to get tickets to the horse jumping in 
August. Our baby is due 2 June, so was inquiring about what I need to do
about tickets for the new baby.

'They said everyone needs a ticket - fine. Children’s tickets are £1 - fine. 

'But there are no children’s tickets for the horse jumping so I have to pay £95 to have a three-month-old in a sling!

'They said the only alternative was to re-sell my ticket or give it to someone else.'

Anyone wishing to re-sell their tickets must submit their request to Olympic organisers by a February 3 deadline. A second wave of ticket re-sales will occur in April.

According
to 2012 organisers, it possible for people to give tickets away to 
friends and family as long as they are not sold on the open market.
