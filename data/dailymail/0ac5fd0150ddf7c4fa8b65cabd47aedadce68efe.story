Stoke City’s former Barcelona whizzkid Bojan Krkic has reclaimed the No27 shirt he wore when tipped to be the next Lionel Messi.

Bojan has signed for Mark Hughes after failing to live up to the early hype when he made his Nou Camp debut at 17.

In a live webchat with Stoke fans on Friday night, Bojan predicted the good times would return for  him in The Potteries and explained why he’s chosen to wear the 27 shirt this season.

No 27: Bojan Krkic wants to get back to his best after picking his old Barcelona shirt number at Stoke

Wonderkid: The Spain youngster was tipped for great things when he started his career at the Nou Camp

‘It was my first number at Barcelona and because this is the start of a new era, I thought it would be nice to have it again. I wore 11 at Ajax on loan last season.

‘I still feel the same player as I did when I began at Barcelona and I feel I have more experience now that will hopefully help me here.’

Though unflattering comparisons have been made between Barcelona and Stoke, 23-year-old Bojan has been impressed with the quality of his new team-mates in his first day in training.

‘I saw that the idea here is to get the ball down and play good football,’ he said. ‘There are many good players here who want to play with the ball at their feet. I think that will suit the style I want to play.

‘I know what I am capable of on the pitch. I like to get the ball on the ground, make good plays and move the ball around the pitch quickly at a good tempo. I like to build good relationships with other players too, which is important.’

Prodigy: Bojan Krkic was younger than even Lionel Messi (R) when he made his Barcelona debut

Bojan beat Messi’s post-war record when he made his Barcelona debut in La Liga aged 17 years and 19 days.

He was capped by Spain at 18 and was originally named in their Euro 2008 squad as a teenager before withdrawing because of fatigue.

But he’s not lived up to his teenage promise since, having spells at Roma, AC Milan and Ajax before Barca decided to sell him to England for a nominal fee.

Part of the problem the player believes is that he’s been used as a winger too often and he is adamant he would like a more central role at Stoke.

‘I like to play as a striker or second striker. In recent seasons, I have played out wide but I do feel that my best position is in a more central role,’ he said.

Pot luck: The 23-year-old has consulted former teammate Marc Muniesa (L) before signing for Stoke

Bojan consulted with former Barca team-mate Marc Muniesa who joined Stoke last season before agreeing his own switch.

The forward whose own idol growing up was Patrick Kluivert was also aware that manager Mark Hughes played for Barca in the 1980s.

‘I wanted to come here to play for a team on the up,’ he said.

‘The Premier League is somewhere I always wanted to play, so this is a good opportunity for me.

‘It is a very exciting league and one I am excited to play in. Mark also told me of the ambitions here and that was important to me.’

Great expectations: Stoke will be hoping to improve after signing the likes of Mame Biram Diouf

Muniesa also joined in the webchat and warned Bojan that he may need to toughen up.

He said: ‘I understand that the managers like the players to be stronger maybe than in Spain, and over the 12 months, I did a lot of gym work that has helped me.’

Stoke finished ninth last season and Hughes is hoping to go even higher this season having already signed five new players including Bojan and ex-Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf.
