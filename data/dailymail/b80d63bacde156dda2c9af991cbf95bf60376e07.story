Two parents of a 9-month-old girl named Avarice have been charged with her neglect - days after a fundraising page was set up to collect money for her funeral.

Adam  and Jasmyne Alexander, both 21, were charged on Thursday with felony neglect after allegedly leaving their baby girl alone in her crib from 8:30pm Saturday night to 12:30pm Sunday, when she was found dead.

The young couple have been living with Adam's mother and sister in Nokesville, Virginia.

Police say that the baby was put to sleep on her stomach Saturday night. Later Jasmyne got home from work and the parents drank that night and went to sleep. 

They t hen didn't check on their child until the next day.

Emergency responders pronounced the child dead on site at about 1pm Sunday.

According to detectives, NBC reports, the baby had not been to a doctor in seven months despite the fact her parents had noticed she was having breathing problems four weeks ago. 

Hours after the child died a GoFundMe page was set up to collect funds in Avarice's name.

Avarice had not been to a doctor in seven months. Her parents told authorities she had developed breathing problems about four weeks ago

As of Saturday, over $5,000 had been raised for the baby's funeral fund. A woman who says she is the baby's aunt Mia has updated the site to say the parents would get no extra money raised. Mia also acknowledged that baby may not have died of SIDS as originally claimed

The day after Avarice died her mom Jasmyne put up a photo of the baby on Instagram which included the hashtag #rip and directed people to the GoFundMe. Three days after this post she was charged with felony neglect

Days later, after the parents were charged, someone named Mia, claiming to be the baby's aunt, posted an update.

On Friday she wrote in part, 'Even if the baby did not pass from SIDS I will still donate the remaining fund money because that is what I stated I would do. Please do no criticize me I have all the right intentions & I loved my niece dearly :'( The parents have no access to any of the online donations that have been made here.'

Photos on social media show the couple's wedding and several photos of the baby. 

On instagram, before her arrest, Jasmyne wrote alongside a photo of her child, '#imissyou #iloveyou #rip.'

Avarice, which isn't common as a name, is a noun meaning, according to Merriam Webster, 'excessive or insatiable desire for wealth or gain.'

The couple are being held on a $10,000 secured bond. 

Little Avarice was given a name which names 'extreme greed'. She was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency responders
