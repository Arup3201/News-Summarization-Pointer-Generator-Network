No questions: Paradise Valley police would not answer questions at a news conference today after they announced five people have been arrested in conjunction with the Shapiro murders

Until Tuesday, Paradise Valley police 
had released few details about the horrific  crime, including whether 
the Shapiros were robbed or what they think the motive might have been.

The murders were the first in Paradise Valley since 2004 and shook neighbours, police and the town mayor.

Police Chief John Bennett said Tuesday that there was no evidence to indicate the Shapiros were specifically targeted.

Earlier Tuesday, family and friends gathered in a packed downtown Phoenix theatre for a memorial service for the couple.

Arson: The couple's convertible vehicle was discovered on fire 20 miles away from their home

Evidence: Glass and sooty footprints can be seen around the front door front door of the Paradise Valley home of Lawrence and Glenna Shapiro in Paradise Valley

The Shapiro's vehicle was discovered on fire 20 miles away from their home.

It was when an officer arrived at their house that he saw smoke coming from inside and called the fire department. The bodies were found once the fire was put out.

Philanthropic: The couple actively supported many civic organizations and charities and were well-known in the Paradise Valley community

The deaths were the first homicides in the upscale community in nearly eight years, Chief Bennett said.

'This
particular crime is a heinous crime and it can happen anywhere,' he 
said. 'People in Paradise Valley hopefully understand it can happen even
to them.'

Bennett said investigators hadn't identified any suspects or determined a motive.

'This is going to be a prolonged, complex investigation that's going to take probably quite a lot of time,' he said.

The bodies of the couple were found in the master bedroom and police confirmed that a fire had been started in that bedroom and another.

Their deaths have shaken a police department that last 
investigated a homicide in 2004 and residents were being told to 
lock their doors and pay attention to their surroundings.

The distraught family of the couple visited the home on Tuesday evening and were brought around by police.

justice those who were responsible.'

Soul mates: The couple celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary in 2010

The home showed almost no damage from 
the outside, but sooty footprints and broken glass were strewn about the
porch Wednesday, and part of the original wood door was replaced with 
plywood.

The sprawling home sits in a 
neighborhood near some of the area's nicest resorts and lushest golf 
courses, and has stunning views of Phoenix's Camelback Mountain and 
Piestewa Peak - areas that are popular among hikers, runners and 
mountain-bikers.

The Shapiros celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2010, The Arizona Republic reported, the same year they founded a charitable organization, the Lawrence and Glenna Shapiro Family Foundation.

Lawrence
Shapiro, 79, had a 45-year career as a gastroenterologist.

He and his wife 
actively supported many civic organizations and charities, including the
Phoenix Symphony, the Arizona Opera, the Phoenix Art Museum, and the 
National Kidney Foundation of Arizona, according to the Republic.

Glenna Shapiro had served as the kidney foundation's executive director and was on the opera's board for 15 years.

Mayor Scott LeMarr said he and his wife, Teri, have known the Shapiros for more than 20 years.

He told the Tribune: 'They were the dearest, kindest and most generous people you could ever have the honor to know, and their love of their family and generosity to the Paradise Valley community was immeasurable.

'They will be sorely missed and my wife especially will miss her exercise partner and friend. I'm confident our police department will bring those responsible for this apparently heinous act to justice.'
