Russia is set to send an unmanned probe to the moon in 2015.

The craft, called Luna-Glob, or Moon-Globe, will be carried by the first rocket to blast off from a new facility that Russia is building in its far eastern Amur region.

It will consist of an orbital 
module and a probe that would land on the moon and beam back information
about samples it takes from the surface.

'We will begin our exploration of the
moon from there,' Roskosmos director Vladimir Popovkin said, according to the Interfax news agency.

The new space centre will decrease 
Russia's reliance of the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the ex-Soviet nation 
Kazakhstan, which it leases.

State-run news agency Ria Novosti has said that it will carry dust monitors and plasma sensors to sense high-energy cosmic rays as well.

It will be the first Russian trip to the moon since the 1970s

The Soviet Union got a jump on the United States in the Cold War space race, sending a probe to the moon in 1959 and putting the first person into space in 1961.

But the United States first put a man on the moon in 1969 and Russia has not done so.

The last successful Soviet launch of a unmanned probe to the moon was in the 1970s, and Russia has suffered setbacks in its space program in recent years, including bungled satellite launches and the failure of a Mars probe in 2011.

A successful rocket launch on Tuesday put three military satellites in orbit, the Defense Ministry said.

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan last month to spend 2.1 trillion roubles ($70 billion) on space industry development in 2013-2020, to pursue projects to explore the moon and Mars, among other things
