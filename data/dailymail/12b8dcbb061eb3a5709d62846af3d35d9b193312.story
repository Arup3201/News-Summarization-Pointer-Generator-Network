Police hunting for the killer of a stay-at-home mum have released chilling CCTV footage of her last moments when she casually bought drinks at a supermarket just two days before she was found brutally murdered.

Traci O'Sullivan, 41, was found dead by her ex-partner and their five-year-old son at her North Frankston home in Melbourne on Saturday, February 7.

Detectives believe Ms O'Sullivan knew her attacker and they may have suffered serious cuts to their hands caused by holding a weapon used to murder her.

Police have released CCTV footage of the last time Traci O'Sullivan was seen in public before she was found brutally murdered in her North Frankston home on February 7

Family say they last saw the 41-year-old at her mother's house on February 5.

Newly released CCTV footage from the day she was last seen shows a barefoot Ms O'Sullivan buying drinks at an IGA store in Frankston North about 4.20pm before she headed to her home just 700 metres away.

Police hope the images of the woman in a pink singlet and denim shorts would prove to be a trigger for those who saw her in the lead up to her death.

Detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey said investigators believed Ms O'Sullivan most likely knew her attacker as she was known to be security conscious.

'There were no signs of forced entry to the property which makes us believe that Traci has willingly let her killer into her home,' he said. 

'Given the nature of Traci's injuries we believe that the person responsible may have suffered cuts to their palms or hands which may have required medical attention. 

'If you believe you know of someone with unexplained injuries like this around the time of Traci's death, we would like to speak to you. This includes anyone within the medical field who may have treated someone with injuries like this.'

Ms O'Sullivan suffered multiple injuries sometime in the two days before her body was discovered. 

Police would not reveal details about the type of weapon or cause of death, saying only that she suffered from a severe physical attack.

It is believed Ms O'Sullivan had been using dating apps Oasis and Scout late last year, but friends and family say she never mentioned any connections.

Detectives have spoken to a number of people, including Ms O'Sullivan's friends but haven't been able to establish a motive for the killing.

'We have conducted lengthy enquiries with friends and acquaintances to try and identify why Traci may have come to harm and have also been able to ascertain Traci was active on social media,' Mr Bailey said. 

'We are keeping an open mind but have not been able to establish a reason why anyone would want to kill Traci. 

The 41-year-old was found dead by her ex-partner and their five-year-old son at her North Frankston home in Melbourne on Saturday, February 7

'We are appealing for anyone who may have seen Traci in the days leading up to her death, and for anyone who had direct contact with Traci on social media, to contact police.

'Traci has a young son, loving parents and two sisters who are desperately seeking answers to this family tragedy.'

Anyone with information about Traci O'Sullivan's death is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
