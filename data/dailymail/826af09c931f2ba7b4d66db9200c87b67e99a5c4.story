Victim: Amina Bibi was found by her 11-year-old son having suffered multiple stab wounds at her home in Forest Gate, east London on Friday

A schoolboy pleaded with a neighbour to 'help my mum, help my mum' after he returned home from school to collect his homework and found his mother had been murdered.

The 11-year-old boy desperately banged on his neighbour's door on Friday morning looking for help after he found Amina Bibi, 43, in a pool of blood at her flat in Forest Gate, east London.

The boy, who was being walked to school by his father, had returned home to pick up his homework and it is thought that he may have disturbed Mrs Bibi's killer by ringing the doorbell.

She had suffered multiple stab wounds.

Detectives have today said that Mrs Bibi's murder may have a 'domestic element' to it. They have so far arrested two men in connection with the killing.

They are being questioned at an east London police station this afternoon.

Neighbour Jamal Omar, 41, said the boy came knocking on his door, screaming for help, moments after he let him into the block of flat via the intercom system.

The father-of-two said: 'He came banging on my door, shouting for help. When I opened the door he said "help my mum. I don’t know what’s wrong with her".

'I went next door with him and saw Amina lying face down on the floor, covered in blood.

'I rang 999 and they told me to revive her but it was too late for me to do anything.

'She was a lovely woman. The family have lived here at long as we have, we’ve known each other for 10 years.

'It’s such a terrible thing. They are a good family, nobody deserves this.

'I haven’t seen her husband or children since it happened.'

Detective Chief Inspector David Whellams, who is leading the investigation into Mrs Bibi's death, added: 'As the son entered the flat he found the body of his mother.

'The son contacted the dad who returned and by the time he got back the ambulance crew had arrived.

'The family at the moment are bearing-up as well as they can after this tragedy. The children are very upset and are being looked after by relatives.'

Police believe that Mrs Bibi's killer would have been covered in blood when he fled her east London flat.

Detective Chief Inspector Whellams said: 'From intelligence we believe he has run to the back of the block of flats and away, as a blood trail in the flat suggests they left by the back of the property.

'We have a CCTV image that looks like he was carrying some sort of garment or cloth, like a jacket, towel or other clothing.

'We believe he would have been very noticeable and appeal for anyone who saw him to get in touch. At that time of day there were kids being dropped off at the school and there were people on their way to work as he ran down the road.

'People also need to look out for any discarded garments or items that may be covered in blood.'

Confirming that a 64-year-old man and a man in his forties had been arrested and are being questioned by police, a Scotland Yard spokesman said this afternoon: 'This is a complex and fast moving investigation and one current line of inquiry is that the murder may have a domestic element.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
