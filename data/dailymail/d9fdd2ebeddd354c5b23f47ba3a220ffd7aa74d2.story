Penn State University's ex-president and two former top school administrators have been ordered to stand trial on charges accusing them of a cover-up in the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal.

Prosecutors showed enough evidence during a two-day preliminary hearing to warrant a full criminal court trial for ex-president Graham Spanier, former vice-president Gary Schultz and ex-athletic director Tim Curley, Judge William Wenner said.

The Judge described it as a 'tragic day for Penn State University' at a hearing on Tuesday.

Trial: Former Penn State president Graham Spanier, above, Gary Schultz, below left, and Tim Curley, below right, will face charges of covering up a child sex abuse scandal

State prosecutors alleged that the university officials failed to tell police about sexual abuse allegations involving Sandusky, the university's assistant football coach, and then tried to cover up what they knew about it.

All three have said that they are innocent and were not aware of the allegation against Sandusky in 2001.

They said they had believed that Sandusky and the boy were engaged in nothing more than horseplay in a university locker room shower.

The 68-year-old was convicted last year of 45 counts of child sexual abuse. He still maintains his innocence and is appealing the 30 to 60-year state prison term.

Mike McQueary, a football team graduate assistant in 2001, testified that he saw Sandusky and a boy engaged in a sex act in the locker room shower and, within days, reported it to coach Joe Paterno, as well as to Curley and Schultz.

Charges: A poster of the three men who are now due to stand trial was displayed at a news conference in November last year

However, 59-year-old Curley, and Schultz, 63, claimed that Mr McQueary never reported that the encounter was sexual in nature, and Spanier, 65, has said that the pair never told him about any sort of sex abuse of a boy.

The three were charged with perjury, 
obstruction, endangering the welfare of children, failure to properly 
report suspected abuse and conspiracy.

Those charges include allegations of hiding evidence from investigators and lying to the grand jury.

According to CNN, e-mails found during a Penn State internal investigation into Sandusky led, in part, to the charges against the officials.

The e-mails show that the men decided to tell Sandusky to stop bringing children from his charity to the locker room after an incident in 2001.

Their 'conspiracy of silence' allowed Sandusky to abuse at least three more children on campus between 2001 and 2009, Chief Deputy Attorney General Bruce Beemer told the court, according to The Morning Call.

Curley
and Schultz were initially charged in November 2011, when Sandusky was 
arrested, and they were accused of perjury and failure to properly 
report the incident.

Jailed: Assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts of child sex abuse

Abuse: It is claimed the three men failed to take action after being told that Sandusky engaged in a sex act with a boy in a locker room shower at the university

Spanier was forced out as president at that time. A year later, he was charged with covering up a complaint about Sandusky, and additional charges were filed against Curley and Schultz.

Spanier remains a faculty member on administrative leave. Paterno was fired from his position as coach and died in January last year.

A date for the trial has not yet been set, but an attorney for Schultz predicted it may not be held until March next year.
