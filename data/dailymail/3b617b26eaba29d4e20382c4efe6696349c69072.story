Rude awakening: A man answers the door in his dressing gown as police in Tyne and Wear deliver early morning warnings to nightmare neighbours

They are the neighbours from hell known for their noisy parties, screaming arguments and anti-social behaviour.

But this time they were the ones getting a rude awakening.

Police in Tyne and Wear burst in to a series of homes in the early hours of yesterday morning to deliver final warnings or eviction notices.

Officers visited 22 homes in Wallsend to tell tenants - many dressed in pyjamas and dressing gowns - that they face being booted out if they do not mend their ways.

All the tenants had racked up a shameful series of complaints from those living around them fed up by their noise, anti-social behaviour, music, loud arguments.

After issuing a number of warnings, staff from North Tyneside Council's Safer Estates Team served 20 tenants with legal notices giving them one last chance to change before losing their homes.

And two were handed eviction notices telling them court proceedings would soon be started to kick them out.

The action was taken as part of a joint police and council initiative called Operation Respect.

North Tyneside council's safer estates manager, Colin Boxshall, said: 'Operation Respect involves serving nuisance households with final warning notices. If the anti-social behaviour continues people risk being evicted.'

Crimes linked to the properties included drunk and disorderly, theft, criminal damage, breach of the peace, drug offences, threatening behaviour, intimidation, noise nuisance and shoplifting.

One
man who lives next door to a block where three households were served 
with notices said his neighbours were making life a misery for him.

The
pensioner said: 'It's been a nightmare living next to them. There are 
parties and noise going on until about 3am in the morning, and people 
keep breaking the door in.

'I'm really glad something is being done.'

Serving notices: A woman is handed a notice by police as a crackdown on noisy neighbours is launched in Tyne and Wear

Police and council officials visited 22 homes in Wallsend to tell tenants, many dressed in pyjamas and dressing gowns, that they face being booted out if they do not mend their ways

Among
the 16 people visited, eight were also asked to sign Acceptable 
Behaviour Agreements. A mother was also given an eviction order because 
of her out-of-control son's behaviour.

The
12-year-old had received repeated warning from police for terrorising a
local vicar, jumping out in front of his car, and throwing fireworks.

Inspector Neil Armsworth, of Northumbria Police, said it was essential that residents report anti-social behaviour to police so that his officers can take action.

And he explained that eviction warnings were a better deterrent than arrests on some cases.

'It's
particularly impactive that the other residents in the street that have
to put up with the people see something being done,' he said.

'Quite
often these people are involved in low level crime but on a regular 
basis, and this can be more impactive on people's everyday lives than a 
more serious crime that is a one off.

'Northumbria Police is 
committed to addressing the issues that are affecting our communities, 
be it crime or anti-social behaviour related.

'Behaviour of this description is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.

'We
will continue to work together with partners in North Tyneside Council 
to take enforcement action against anyone whose behaviour is having a 
detrimental affect on the community.

'I
would absolutely encourage people to report anti-social behaviour to us
because we won't know about it if they don't tell us.'

'North
Tyneside's elected mayor Norma Redfearn added: 'We are committed to 
ensuring North Tyneside is a safe and enjoyable place to live and we 
will not allow the minority to spoil it.

'Everyone
should feel safe and happy in their homes and neighbourhoods, and we 
will take necessary and prompt action to protect that right.

'I
am pleased this operation was successful and sent a clear message that 
anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated in this borough.'
