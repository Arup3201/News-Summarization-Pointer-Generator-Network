Manchester City must make changes in all areas of the pitch in order to sustain a challenge at home and in Europe next season, according to Rodney Marsh.

The club legend branded the signing of defender Eliaquim Mangala as 'terrible' and said star striker Sergio Aguero is 'having a very ordinary time' despite scoring 23 goals this season.

Former England striker Marsh, who played for City between 1972 and 1976, also predicted manager Manuel Pellegrini will be sacked in the summer unless they retain the Premier League.

Former player Rodney Marsh has heavily criticised Manchester City, saying wholesale changes are needed

Striker Marsh played for the Manchester club between 1972 and 1976 

Speaking to the Daily Mirror's Goal Time: 'I think in fact that City have to rebuild the team, not only in a couple of positions, but across the whole team.

'I think Mangala has been a terrible signing. He's shown nothing so far. Fernandinho and Fernando, for me, are not top quality Premier League players.

'Aguero is having a very ordinary time, [Stevan] Jovetic will soon be off, [Samir] Nasri and [Jesus] Navas too, all for me, by their standards, have had very poor seasons.'

On Pellegrini, he added: 'I can see five or six new players coming in to the team next year. I can see a new manager, particularly if they drop out of the top two.'

City currently trail leaders Chelsea by six points, having played a game more, and are being pursued by Arsenal and Manchester United for second spot.

They were also dumped out of the Champions League by Barcelona earlier this month.
