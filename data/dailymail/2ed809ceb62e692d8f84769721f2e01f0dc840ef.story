If you are struggling to find something suitably indulgent to surprise your partner with on Valentine’s Day this year, one hotel may have solved your problem.

The only catch is that you’ll need to find a spare £35,000 to pull it off.

The Exhibitionist Hotel in London’s South Kensington is offering guests the chance to spend the night in one of their luxury suites, which includes bathing in a plunge pool filled with Champagne.

The tub measures an impressive 24m cubed – meaning a lot of fizz will be used in the process.

And couples who take up the offer at the boutique hotel will also be offered ‘enough oysters to fill an ice bath’ along with 30 bouquets of upper class roses.

And if that wasn’t enough, guests will be able to dine on a selection of ‘aphrodisiac delicacies’ including asparagus with truffle oil, strawberries dipped in chocolate and ginger candies.

Fresh figs will also be on the menu, along with raspberries served with whipped cream, a selection of handmade macaroons and chocolates, and breakfast in bed, which is ‘tailored to your desires’ by the Exhibitionist Hotel's chef.

And the package is being touted as perfect for guests who require a little more discretion than usual.

The two suites that are available to host the Valentine’s Luxury Package are located on the lower-ground floor and have their own private entrance away from the main reception of the hotel.
