A retired decorator has painted his whole council house in the style of the Sistine Chapel and is using celebrities as models for his versions of priceless Renaissance paintings.

Robert Burns, who lives in a £93-per-week rented home in Brighton, East Sussex, has depicted Russell Brand as Jesus, Wayne Rooney in prayer and Jose Mourinho as Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi.

The only hint of what is within the 1960s terrace is the Renaissance decorations he has added to his green 
wheelie bin, and his house number is in Roman numerals.

The 66-year-old's ten-year project is all the more impressive because he has never been to Italy and has never been taught art.

When Rome meets Brighton: Retired painter and decorator Robert Burns has painted his council house to look like the Sistine Chapel

Renaissance man: Mr Burns has used celebrities as his muses, including comedian Russell Brand as Jesus, and even his wheelie bin is decorated spectacularly

No clue: Despite the fantastical painting and decorating inside the building, the outside of this humble terrace shows no signs of Mr Burns' flair for art

Grandfather-of-three Mr Burns, 66, said: 'I get inspired when I see a celebrity offering themselves in a Renaissance pose.

'I used the Russell Brand picture from the front of a magazine, I thought he looked like Jesus of Nazareth.

'I just put the crown of thorns on his head.

'It is the camera angle that inspires me.'

He added: 'I don't follow football but when I found out Jose Mourinho calls himself 'The Special One' I knew I had to do him next.

'He is extremely photogenic, there was this photograph and I thought, 'he looks just like the Salvator Mundi photo'.

'Salvator Mundi means Saviour of the World, I think it suits him very well.'

Incredible: The ceilings of his council house have renaissance scenes simlar to those found in Rome, but this one is in his upstairs loo

Magnificent: The grandfather-of-three and former decorator has painted his entire home in this style, although the spare room still needs some work

Inspired by the stars: His religious art includes Wayne Rooney in the style of Francis of Assisi by Francisco de Zurbaran and 'the special one' Jose Mourinho

He has also painted Wayne Rooney in the style of Francis of Assisi by Francisco de Zurbaran after seeing him in prayer.

Mr Burns describes the picture as 'the ultimate hoody'.

Mr Burns has famously painted the entirety of the inside of his terrace home with elaborate frescoes inspired by 15th century Italian painters.

Every surface in his house - bar the spare room - shows a gilt-edged nativity scene, cherub or picture of the Virgin Mary.

In the last year Mr Burns has also dedicated his bathroom to the Renaissance style - in fact there is just one room in his three-bedroom house not yet decorated.

His bathroom has pictures inspired by The Triumph of Galatea by Raphael and The Birth of Venus by Botticelli the ceiling is painted with a version of the Venus and Adonis by Sebastiano Ricci.

Talented: Mr Burns started work on the house in 2003 and ten years on he admits that if he were to leave the house he would want to take his artworks with him, but knows he can't

Magic: His bathroom has pictures inspired by The Triumph of Galatea by Raphael and The Birth of Venus by Botticelli the ceiling is painted with a version of the Venus and Adonis by Sebastiano Ricci

Eye for art: Despite his passion for the renaissance Mr Burns has never visited Italy to see the art in situ and has never been formally taught art

He first started decorating his home in 2003 and in the last decade has dedicated hours to transforming boring magnolia walls into works of art.

Mr Burns said: 'The spare room is still waiting to be painted.

'That will be the next project.

'I have recently completed an altar piece in the bedroom.

'I'm really pleased with how it has all turned out.'

As the work is painted onto plaster if Mr Burns ever moves he will be unable to take his work of art with him.

Despite his passion for the Renaissance Mr Burns has never visited Italy to see the art in situ and has never been formally taught art.

Instead he is inspired by books on art and especially on the Vatican he picks up at car boot sales.

He says his children and grandchildren are used to visiting the house now and 'hardly notice it anymore'.
