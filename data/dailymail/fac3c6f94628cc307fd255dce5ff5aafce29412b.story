A father still grieving over the death of his daughter last year in a car accident received a letter addressed to ‘daughter killed in car crash.’

Mike Seay, of suburban Chicago, received the shocking letter Thursday from OfficeMax. The insensitive addressee was on the second line, under his name.

Daughter Ashley Seay, 17, died along with a friend when she lost control of her SUV last April and it slammed into a tree, according to NBC Chicago.

The devastated father told the station he thinks about his daughter ’10,000 times a day,’ and wanted to know why the office supply chain had such personal information.

‘Why would they have that type of information? Why would they need that?’ He asked. 

‘What purpose does it serve anybody to know that? And how much other types of other information do they have if they have that on me, or anyone else? And how do they use that, what do they use that for?’

Mr Seay debated on Facebook about to handle it before calling the OfficeMax call center, they disregarded his complaint.

All that was left: The SUV was barely recognizable

‘The manager [said] that it was impossible, that this can't be happening,’ he recalled.

A subsequent follow-up by NBC Chicago led to OfficeMax blaming the disturbing mailing on a ‘third-party mailing list provider.’

The company also apologized in a statement.

‘We are deeply sorry that Mr. Seay and his family received this mailing from us, and we are reaching out to Mr. Seay to convey our sincerest apologies on this unfortunate matter,’ the statement said.

‘Based on a preliminary investigation today we believe this to be an inadvertent error; and we are continuing the investigation.’

That explanation brings little comfort to Mr Seay, who told the station the letter made him feel victimized.
