Manchester United manager Van Gaal revealed Young could be out for 'many weeks' after he limped off during the 1-1 draw at Stoke with a hamstring injury. 

Winger Antonio Valencia was ruled out before the match due to a thigh strain before Young hobbled off with a hamstring problem.

Manchester United manager Van Gaal: 'I'm not a doctor so we have to wait for tomorrow or the day after.'

Young pulled up in the 74th minute at the Britannia Stadium and was replaced by Rafael - the same player who came on for Valencia when he was taken off during the half-time interval against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on Sunday. 

Valencia has emerged as United's first-choice right back under Van Gaal and had started the previous 10 Premier League games.

The extent of the injury and the length of time Valencia will be missing is not yet known, but Van Gaal will hoping it is not serious as the Dutchman has lost faith in Brazilian right back Rafael, who was left on the bench for the clash at the Britannia before replacing Young.

It is a position that United are prioritising in the January transfer window.

The Dutchman admitted his side 'had difficulties defending long balls' in an awkward swirling wind in the 1-1 draw at Stoke.

Jonny Evans was particularly thankful to see former team-mate Mame Biram Diouf miss a clear chance after the Northern Ireland international misjudged a long ball.

'It was scrappy, hard to judge the ball with the wind, but that's the challenge for us,' said Evans.

'(Diouf) made a bit of a mess of it and I'm thankful for that.'

Stoke boss Mark Hughes was frustrated by not just the handball appeal, but another penalty shout after Crouch's header against the woodwork.

'We've had two penalties not given,' he said. 'The obvious one was when Crouch headed towards goal and Smalling basically batted the ball down.

'Then when Crouch hits the post, you see Geoff Cameron waiting to put the ball in and he gets taken out.'

He said of his side's overall performance: 'Tactically we were spot-on, they found it very difficult to get their key players on the ball.

'I'm disappointed but pleased we've got more points on the board and a good performance once again.

Hughes also insisted there is 'nothing' in reports linking Crouch with West Brom and former coach Tony Pulis, adding: 'Peter's a big part of what we do here.'

And he revealed playmaker Bojan will be out for another '10 days to a couple of weeks' with a hamstring problem.
