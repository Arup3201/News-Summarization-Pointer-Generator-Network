The wills of more than 41million people, some dating back 156 years, are being published on the internet for the first time in a huge online archive.

The database will allow households across the country to view the detailed legacies of past generations, and request copies of many documents that could previously only be accessed by a face-to-face request.

As well as being able to find out about their own relatives’ histories, they will also be able to look up the wills of famous and influential people of the 19th and 20th centuries, including Sir Winston Churchill and Charles Dickens.

The wills, covering England and Wales and owned by Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), were painstakingly scanned in by hand. 

Last year the handwritten wills of 280,000 First World War soldiers, many of whom died on the frontline, were made available online ahead of the centenary commemorations of the 1914-18 conflict. 

These generated two million searches as people sought to find clues to what roles their relatives played in the war.

The Government has already published wills and other probate materials dating from 1996 on the internet.

Log on to www.gov.uk/search-will-probate and create an account.

Choose the section you wish to search – Wills and Probate 1996 to present; Wills and Probate 1858 to 1996; or Soldiers’ Wills.

There are two search fields – the surname of the deceased and year of death. Both must be filled in. You can also carry out an advanced search, which requires more information.

In the 1996 to present section, a list of results will appear, giving the names, date of probate, probate number, date of death and registry of each person with that name. For instance, for a person called Stanley Wood who died in 2005, there are 12 results. To order a document, click ‘Add to basket’.

Under the 1858 to 1996 section, a page from the probate calendar for that year is returned in search results, providing summaries of names, birthplace and other details. These must be typed into an online ordering form on the right of the screen.

Click on ‘Proceed to checkout’ to pay. Some documents take up to ten days to be sent as electronic copies. The files can be accessed for 31 days.

Now ministers have expanded the database to cover the years from 1858 – the year Probate Service records begin – to 1996.

Including indexes and source documents, it is one of the country’s largest online resources, and will complement the public’s growing interest in genealogy.

Despite a will being intensely personal, many people do not realise that it is, barring a few exceptions, a public document.

Although they will not be able to read the wills at their computers for free, users of search the database at home and then buy copies for £10 each.

Among the wills to be made available is that of Churchill, who left a fortune worth £304,004 – or more than £5.3million in today’s money.

Alan Turing, the cryptologist who cracked the Enigma code to help bring the war to a close, committed suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1954. The brilliant mathematician left a short will with instructions to share his possessions between his colleagues and his mother.

And Winnie the Pooh creator AA Milne gave shares of his future royalties and copyright to the Garrick Club, his favourite club, and Westminster School when he died in 1956.

Courts Minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘This fascinating project provides insights into the ordinary and extraordinary people who helped shape this country, and the rest of the world.

‘It is a fantastic resource not only for family historians but also for anyone with an interest in social history.’ The original wills, many of them handwritten, are held in a secure facility on the outskirts of Birmingham, and the digital copies in a data centre in Milton Keynes.

Phil Greenwood, of Iron Mountain, the specialist records management company which worked on the project for HMCTS, said: ‘The size of the archive is both humbling and impressive.
