Most women rely on a mirror and an avid eye to apply make-up with precision. 

But for one beauty blogger, who lost her eyesight in 2007, it isn't so simple.

Christine Hà, an American chef, writer and blogger from Houston, Texas, has released an inspiring video tutorial showing how she applies her make-up with a tried-and-tested formula.

Christine, 35, who has a video series on YouTube called 'Blind Life of Christine Ha', explains that she decided to release a beauty tutorial after a lot of people asked her how a visually impaired person does their own make-up. 

The chef, who was the first blind contestant of MasterChef and won the show in 2012, said: 'I remember back when I was filming Masterchef we had to do our own hair and make-up.

'I would sit and put on my own make-up and a lot of my friends on the show would watch me in awe because I don't use a mirror.'

Christine, who suffers from neuromyelitis optica, whereby her immune system attacked the optic nerves and spinal cord, begins by applying foundation to cover any redness

Christine, who suffers from neuromyelitis optica, whereby her immune system attacked the optic nerves and spinal cord, explains that she will demonstrate her daily wear make-up. 

'The first thing is foundation,' she begins. 'Now I am in my 30s, I've been told we have to worry more about redness on our skin so I have started wearing it. Brush it all on, which helps it blend really well so I don't have to worry too much about streaks. 

'As you can see, I am covering the area around my nose where I get the most redness, or so I've been told.'

She then takes a pair of eyelash curlers and says: 'A lot of people think this is scary because I can't see, but I can feel the eyelash curler so I know that I have it pressed up against my eyelid.' 

She admits that applying mascara is 'very tricky', but, she says, once you know how long the wand is, you know where to put your hand

She then takes her mascara, which she says is 'very tricky', but, she says, once you know how long the wand is, you know where to put your hand.

She explains: 'You approach you lashes very gently and once you feel the brush on your lashes, you know to start stroking it on. I do two layers on both eyes.'

While she waits for her mascara to dry, she puts on her blush. 'I do about five swirls across my face and always tap before I put it on to get rid of excess,' she says.

Next, she applies lip liner, which she says she also does  by feel. Lastly, she applies eyeliner.

She says: 'Some people may think it's backwards to do your eyeliner last but I want to make sure my mascara is dry because I can't see if it smudges. 

'This can be tricky so I anchor my hands against my face so I can have more control of the pencil. I look up and start in the outer corner and draw in a few gentle line strokes. 

'I don't like to go all the way into my inner corner because this helps make your eyes look a little bigger.'

As well as documenting her daily life, Christine is an accomplished chef with a popular food blog.

On her site, she says: 'I have to depend a lot more on the other senses to cook - taste, smell, how certain ingredients feel', adding that cooking without sight just involves 'a lot of organisation'.
