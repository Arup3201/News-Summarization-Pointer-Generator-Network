An Army driver is facing jail after he was found guilty of killing a teenage biker during an illicit 'Fast and Furious-style' street car rally for petrol-heads.

Gareth Jones, 23, was attending a 'car cruising club' organised on Facebook in which vehicles were raced at speeds of up to 130mph on a remote road next to an industrial estate.

Tragedy struck when he pulled a 'sudden and dangerous' left turn while driving his Ford Focus ST and veered into the path of 19-year-old Jack Bellis who was riding a yellow Suzuki dRZ 400 motorbike.

The youngster, who was also driving at high speed, stood no chance of avoiding a crash and smashed headlong into the passenger side of the Focus. He suffered multiple injuries and died in hospital the following afternoon.

Serving soldier Jones, from Widnes, Cheshire, who was on leave at the time of the crash in October 2012, had passed every military driving qualification suitable to his rank.

At Chester Crown Court he was convicted of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving by a jury but was cleared of the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving.

The jury was told the fatal crash happened in Runcorn after the boy racer type meeting like those featured in the Hollywood movies starring Vin Diesel after it was advertised on the social media network.

Witnesses reported seeing cars in 'rolling races', travelling at speeds estimated at 130mph in the 40mph zone.

One witness had reported seeing two cars, which were not involved in the crash, racing side by side just minutes before the collision.

Another witness, Christopher Filkins, saw Mr Bellis, from Padgate, Warrington riding on his bike at speeds estimated between 80 to 100 mph.

He said: 'Jack was flying up and down the road. I had my back to the road but every time he came into view I would have a quick look.'

The rider had completed two laps before deciding to go home. He had not been racing other cars but was simply 'showing off'.

Loss: Floral tributes at the scene of the accident where Jack Bellis died

Peter Hussey, prosecuting, said: 'Being a remote area, being away from ordinary motorists and police, young drivers wanted to show off their vehicles, show off the speed of their vehicles, and try their racing prowess out against each other.

'Clearly, and I don’t shirk from this, Jack Bellis was there to join the event.'

He said racers were 'performing to an audience' with people watching from grass verges, and that Jones was guilty of 'deliberate risk taking'.

Mr Bellis' bike was following Jones’ 'performance car' in single file, on one side of the public road. The soldier appeared to be crossing into the centre of the road as if he was going to park on the other side of the road.

But he then suddenly changed his mind and began to turn left into the mouth of a side road - and into the path of the teenager.

After the crash Jones got out of the car in a state of shock, saying ‘I didn’t see him’. He passed a breath test.

A tribute to Mr Bellis, who was described as an 'excellent and safe rider'

Jones denied both charges and said the victim was to blame for the crash. He said he had slowed down and indicated before attempting a U-turn.

But Judge Thomas Teague QC told him: 'I take the view that this falls into the highest category of cases of driving without due care and attention, those that are described as falling just short of causing death by dangerous driving.

'It is as close as it gets, in my opinion - and think it falls into the most serious category of that offence.

'That means you must expect an immediate custodial sentence. This is a very serious case.'

Jones, who has been in the Army since 2007 was said by his chief commanding officer to be of 'sound judgement at all times'. The court heard he was a 'committed soldier' who was tipped for promotion after setting a 'good example to his comrades'.

He will be sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court on April 16. He as released on unconditional bail and given an interim driving ban.

Mr Bellis was a keen angler had won an Associate Rider of the Year award with Warrington Advance Motorcyclists. A scheme has been set up in his memory to help bikers complete a ‘Skill For Life’ course.

Geoff Kelly, a senior observer with the group, said: 'Jack was an excellent and safe rider. I told Jack that I wouldn’t be happy with him until he had done a 100 per cent perfect ride. He did it eventually on his 13th run - the morning of his test.

'To take all that in and come out on top, at such a young age, was truly exceptional.'
