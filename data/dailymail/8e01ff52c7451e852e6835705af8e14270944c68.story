Spending two weeks in a storage box isn't most holidaymakers' idea of a relaxing break.

But guests may be surprised when they visit a new and unusual Chinese hotel, which has been built from shipping containers.

Thirty-five recycled containers of different sizes were used to make the quirky 21-room venue in China's Shanxi province.

Judging by these pictures, it could be a welcome retreat for cleaners at the Olympics in London, who have complained that their temporary accommodation is shabby and uncomfortable.

Covering an area of 5,000 square metres in an attractive country location, the hotel has courtyard rooms, deluxe suites, a lobby and restaurants.

Rooms have double beds positioned behind stylish double doors and access to patio areas so guests can sit outside and relax.

The hotel, created by Beijing-based firm Tonghe Shanzi Landscape Design, took three months to design and transport and is expected to open in August.

Cleaners at the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, might be in need of a rest by then.

Earlier this week the Daily Mail revealed that the cleaners were being housed ten to a room at a huge temporary compound.

The campsite in East London, hidden from public view, has 25 people sharing each toilet and 75 to each shower.

They sleep in portable cabins, some of which have been leaking in the rain.

Spanish student Andrea Murnoz, 21, came to the UK for a job but changed her mind when she saw the conditions, which she said reminded her of a 'prison camp'.

Craig Lovett, of Spotless International Services which runs the camp, defended its facilities.

He said the number of toilets and showers per person exceeded requirements for temporary accommodation and that there were internet, medical and entertainment facilities on-site.
