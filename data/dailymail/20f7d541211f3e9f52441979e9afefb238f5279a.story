Deanna Blegg never backs down from a challenge.

Over the years the Australian has competed in both individual and team adventure races at the elite level all over the world. But none of these exhausting endurance tests compare to an even bigger battle – her fight with HIV. 

It was while travelling through Britain at the age of 24 that she found out she'd contracted it. In an interview with The Age last year Deanna said the prognosis was the worst it could possibly be. 

Deanna Blegg's battle with HIV has driven her on to greater things 

She was given only five years to live. Feeling devastated and a long, long way from home, all she felt was a sense of shame and isolation.

‘The shame stayed with me for so long. I contracted HIV from my boyfriend and yet I felt shameful for it. What is shameful about having a boyfriend and a sexual relationship? Because HIV was a part of it, it left me with this disgusting shameful feeling,' she said. 

Thankfully for Deanna the future was not as bad as was predicted. Her life was saved by the advent of HIV drugs, and from here on she vowed to make use of every day.

Deanna represented Australia in the World’s Toughest Mudder competition

Her miraculous tale continued last week when she beat hundreds of men for the chance to compete in one of the toughest physical challenges on earth. On November 15, Deanna represented Australia in the World’s Toughest Mudder (WTM) – a 24-hour non-stop obstacle course in Las Vegas. 

The 45-year-old mother of two was the only woman in the Australian team of four, and had competed against hundreds of men and women to earn her spot on the team. An amazing 800 people pulled out in the course of the race, but not Deanna.

The WTM is designed to push Mudders to their physical and mental limits. The endurance test is an eight kilometre loop course in the Desert of Las Vegas, Nevada, with 29 obstacles per lap. As Mamamia.com reported, it was nothing she couldn't handle. 

In the Tough Mudder the aim is to run as many laps as possible. In addition to the obstacles, competitors also battle with the elements. Everything from sandstorms with winds of over 100 km-an-hour whipping the runners' faces with sand, to a wind chill factor that can get down to as low as minus five degrees at night, were just a few of the hardships she had to endure.

‘Obstacle racing attracts an incredible amount of women. Sometimes the women outnumber the men. It is a sport where for most the pressure is off and they can go around the course in a group of friends. I love the sport for that reason,’ she told Mamamia.com.

After what she has been through in her personal life it would also be safe to say that she loves life in general every single day too. And it's her memories of those darks times in 1994 when she was first diagnosed with HIV that keeps driving her on.

‘Every woman feels shame, disgust, anger, dirty, damaged, fearful, loss, regret, despair, shock and most importantly we feel alone,’ Blegg said about discovering she had HIV. 

''Whether a woman chooses to share her HIV diagnosis with others or not… there will always be a sense of being alone.'

Now as well as her family, the athletic community from around the world will make sure she never feels that alone again.
