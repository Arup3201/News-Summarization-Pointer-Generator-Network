Authorities in Maine are searching for a 15-year-old feared to have runaway with a man she met off Facebook according to her mother.

Nichole Cable from Glenburn was last seen by her parents at about 9 p.m. on Sunday, the Penobscot County Sheriff's Department reports.

Deputies will not say if her disappearance is suspicious or if she is in danger, but they want to hear from anyone who has information about her whereabouts.

Missing: Authorities say Nichole Kristine Cable, 15, has been missing since Sunday night with her mother suspecting she met a man on Facebook using a fake name of Bryan Butterfield

'We have not heard any word from her through social media or friends,' her father Jason Willey told the Bangor Daily News on Tuesday. 'Her phone’s been shut off. We just don’t know what else to do.'

Cable has light brown hair and blue eyes and weighs 90 pounds. She is a student at Old Town High School.

Her mother, Kristine Willey, told WABI-TV that she was scheduled to meet someone she had met on Facebook.

On a Facebook page labeled Bring Nichole Cable Home, a woman claiming to be Nichole's mother says her daughter had been in contact with a man using a fake name of Bryan Butterfield before her disappearance.

She says that man's profile has since been taken down.

Terrified: Nichole's father says that his daughter's cell phone has since been turned off and they feel utterly hopeless on what more to do

Heartbroken: Nichole's mother has released a heart-breaking plea that whomever is with her that they return her home safely or in a public place where she can call for help

In a heart-breaking public plea to whomever may be with her daughter, the teen's claimed mother begged that she simply be returned safely.

'Please if you have my CoCo, drop her off at a gas station or a park so she can call for help or for me to come get her,' she writes.

'I dont care who you are, I just want her home. She's just a little girl of 15 with her whole life ahead of her. Please bring her home!'

The page has collected more than 3,700 members since its creation with worried members feverishly posting notes of support and concern.

One member claims that the man accused of being in contact with Nichole had unsuccessfully tried to contact other young girls in the past as well.
