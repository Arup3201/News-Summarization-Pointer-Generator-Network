Philip Seymour Hoffman's $10,000-a-month Manhattan apartment was littered with empty bags of a deadly type of heroin, it has been claimed.

Investigators found 49 bags - branded 'Ace of Spades' and 'Ace of Hearts' - inside the fourth-floor apartment, according to officials.

They usually contain a lethal mixture of heroin laced with fentanyl - an opiate used to soothe the pain of cancer patients.

Philip Seymour Hoffman was discovered dead from a drug overdose that may have been caused by a lethal heroin fentanyl mix responsible for overdoses around the United Sates

The unusual brand names are among hundreds of stamps used by drug distribution crews to mark products, according to CNN.

However, they haven't been seen in New York since 2008.

The heroin - variously labelled as 'Bud 
ice', 'Income tax' and 'Theraflu' - has been linked to more than 100 
deaths from coast to coast.

The hardest hit states in 
the epidemic are Maryland, with more than three dozen deaths since 
September, and Pennsylvania, with almost two dozen this month alone, 
according to reports.

And a further 22 people died of 
heroin-fentanyl overdoses in Rhode Island during the first two weeks of 
this year, officials told the Providence Journal.

Deadly: Investigators found 49 empty bags stamped with 'Ace of Spades' and 'Ace of Hearts' inside the actor's Manhattan apartment, according to officials. They usually contain a lethal mix of heroin and fentanyl - also known as 'Bud Ice' (above)

Risk: The lethal concoction - also referred to as 'Theraflu' - has been linked to more than 100 deaths in the US

Yesterday, Fox reported that police were 'looking at if (Hoffman) had the bad batch going around.'

Hoffman, 46, who won the Academy Award 
for best actor for the 2005 film, Capote, was found dead in his 
apartment on Sunday morning following an apparent drug overdose.

Officials said the American actor and father of three was found on
 the bathroom floor of the $11,000 a month West Village 
apartment.

He was wearing only shorts and a t-shirt - and had a hypodermic needle sticking out of his left arm, according to officials.

A neighbor who saw the actor on Saturday told Fox that he looked, 'Gray, not good.'

Heroin
 overdose deaths across the country are spiking as the deadly new variant 
of the drug mixed with fenatanyl is spreading from New 
Hampshire to Washington State.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane is so concerned about the deaths she announced a task force comprised of state, county and local police departments dedicated solely to eradicating it from Western Pennsylvania.

Though Pennsylvania’s cases have so far 
been the highest profile, Maryland’s medical examiner says 37 people in 
the state have died in the last five months from injecting the poisonous
 potion, CBS DC reported.

The deaths were spread throughout the whole state, with 10 occurring in drug-ravaged Baltimore.

'People believe that they’re shooting heroin but the substance does not look like heroin and they’re shooting it and they’re dying,' a rehabilitation expert told the Providence Journal.

Deadly: Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, and is being blamed for the rash of recent deaths

Police in Portsmouth, NH, responded 
to three overdoses in a single 24-hour period one day last week alone, 
one of those people died, an official told Portsmouth Patch.

Meanwhile, authorities in Nassau County, a Long Island suburb of New York, say the deadly dope has recently killed at least five people, Newsday reported.

Other deaths linked to fentanyl-laced heroin have also been reported in Louisiana and Washington State. 

People
 are overdosing because the combination of fentanyl and heroin is recent
 trend, and results in a much more powerful high than users have seen 
before.

Fentanyl is an 
opiate up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, Dr Karl Williams, 
the Allegheny County (PA) Medical Examiner told CBS News.

The people who died from overdose were all discovered to have taken the lethal combination.

Not like normal heroin: The killer heroin has a white color (pictured), far from the yellow tinted heroin most often found on the street

‘They
 found almost exactly the same substance in those stamped bags, a fifty –
 fifty mixture of heroin with Fentanyl,’ he said, adding the opiate 
provides a higher high than heroin by itself.

A Pittsburgh addict who declined to be identified told CBS News of his close brush with death after taking ‘bud ice.’

His dealer told him to ‘be careful,’ which he said is the first time he’d ever been warned.

‘I
 go home, lock myself in my bathroom and I do [the drugs], and within 20
 seconds I was out,’ he recalled, saying his mother broke down the door 
to revive him.

Maryland’s chief medical examiner told CBS Baltimore the heroin variant kills people by shutting down their respiratory system.

‘Both substances slow down your breathing and can eventually slow it down to the point of death.'Officials
 in Louisiana, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Washington State have 
also blamed the drug for overdoses in their regions, according to CBS.

First major bust: Tywon Newby is the first suspected dealer arrested for slinging the tainted dope

Fentanyl-heroin
 combinations have reared their ugly heads in the past, most notably 
during the spring of 2006 in Chicago and Detroit – almost 300 people 
died from February to June while using the drug between the two cities, 
according to the Washington Post.

Authorities say that the easiest way to spot the more lethal heroin cocktail is because it is white. Heroin usually has a yellow tint to it.

Even more scary, one expert told CBS News, is that dope slingers appear willing to let the drug kill some addicts because it will attract more business from junkies chasing a more potent high.

‘They're willing to lose four or five people to a drug overdose death to maybe attract 30 or 40 new customers and that's just the cost of doing business,’ said Dr. Neil Capretto of Gateway Rehab.

Sobering reality: The arrest of Tywon Newby (left) took a significant amount of the tainted dope of the streets, but also showed investigators dealers may have already started re-branding it to evade targeted enforcement

Pennsylvania authorities may have finally started making progress in their fight against the deadly blend. A slate of arrests has been announced over the past 24 hours of people charged with distribution.

Tywon Newby, 39, of Clairton, was found with 2,000 bags of heroin, 48 more bricks of heroin, and more than $8,500 in cash, authorities said.

Other arrests resulted in the seizure of thousands more bags of the lethal mixture, the Pittsburgh Tribune reported.

The arrest of Mr Newby also brought forth a sobering discovery, he had begun labeling the heroin-fentanyl blend ‘sky high.’
