A film fanatic father has found a way to make sure his daughter is never late for school - in his Back To The Future DeLorean.

Every morning Steve Wickenden takes Molly, eight,  to school  in an exact replica of the  car that takes Marty McFly and mad scientist Doc back in time in the much-loved 1985  film.

But instead of heading to 1955 Hill Valley, California, Steve and Molly drive around their home town of Deal in Kent.

Outatime: Molly, eight, gets to go to school in a time machine (sort of) thanks to her movie fanatic father's obsession with the 1985 hit comedy Back To The Future

The power of love: Steve had Universal Studios in the U.S. turn his car into a replica of the time machine, and added more features himself for maximum accuracy

Steve said: 'We certainly turn a few heads. There are always people waving and beeping at us when we drive past.

'There certainly isn't anyone else at the school gates with a flux capacitor,' he added, referencing the technological marvel that turns the DeLorean into a time machine.

He says fellow drivers have even followed them home just to get a picture with the painstakingly-recreated motor.

Classic: The quintessential 80s film still draws crowds to the cinema and special screening events to this day. Left, Michael J Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc

Fuel source:

Steve's DeLorean: Petrol

Film car: Plutonium/lightning bolt/fusion from household waste

What happens when it hits 88mph?

Steve's DeLorean: Steve runs the risk of a speeding conviction

Film car: Travels back in time, resulting in hijinks and a subplot about a teenager going on a date with his own mother

Power:

Steve's DeLorean: 2.76 V6 engine

Film car: 1.21 gigawatts

Drives on:

Steve's DeLorean: Roads

Film car: 'Where we're going, we don't need roads' 

Classmates are desperate for a ride in the car and Molly and she wants to learn to drive in it when she turns 17.

Account manager Steve's DeLorean was turned into the 80s time machine by Universal Studios in the run up to film's 25th anniversary in 2010.

Steve brought the car to the UK  and since then it's been serving as his family's runaround.

Complete with a flux capacitor, an energy reactor and all the dials and clogs, it's in such high demand that he hires it out as wedding transport and fundraising events.

The movie buff has even added extra features to make it an exact replica of the car in the original movie, so not even the biggest film buffs could tell the difference.

He's invested in neon lights and a sound system to blast classic 80s hits as he drives around.

And tinkering in his garage he's managed to attach a gadget to blow gas from the bumpers so it imitates the moment Marty and Doc travel back in time.

His upgrades mean he thinks the car's value has soared from the £47,000 he paid for it to between £75,000 to £100,000.

Steve said: 'People can't believe it when we drive it down the street.

'They wave and beep at us, we've even had a few people follow us home in their cars just for the chance of a picture with it.

'Our car is exactly the same as what you have seen Michael J Fox driving.

'The original from the film is in such a state of disrepair that it's not driveable so this as close as you can get really.

'Even though we get some funny looks, we love the car.

'My wife bought it for me as a gift and it's great that it's not just a show piece. It is road legal and we are always taking it for a spin.'

1.21 gigawatts or unleaded? In the absence of plutonium or a handy lightning strike, Steve has to fill up at the local station

Drivers have even followed the father and daughter home just to get a picture with the painstakingly-recreated motor

Proud: Molly loves her father's car and hopes to learn to drive in it. She says her classmates are desperate for a spin too.

His upgrades mean he thinks the car's value has soared from the £47,000 he paid for it to between £75,000 to £100,000

Steve admits some people give the car a funny look, but most people are delighted when they see him driving around

The movie buff has even added extra features to make it an exact replica of the car in the original movie, so not even the biggest film buffs could tell the difference

He added: 'People always think it's going to be really nippy but it's not actually that fast.

'But thanks to the time-travelling qualities, we always make sure Molly's not late for school.'

Molly said: 'It's the best way to get to school and all my friends are jealous that I get such a cool lift.

'I definitely want to learn to drive in the DeLorean.'
