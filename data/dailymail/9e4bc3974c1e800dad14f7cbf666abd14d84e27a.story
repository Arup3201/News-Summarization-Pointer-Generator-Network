The family of a Sydney nun who perished on Flight MH17 have released a moving poem that was close to Sister Philomene's heart and she used to help others who were grieving find the strength to carry on.

Sister Philomene Tiernan, 75, had visited the grave of the poem's author, Saint Madeleine Barat, in France, as part of her trip through Europe.

She had also been in Europe to commemorate the death of her uncle whose fighter plane was shot down over Germany in World War II.

Sister Philomene Tiernan was in the Netherlands last month with 10 other relatives to pay her respects to her uncle, RAAF gunner Patrick Tiernan, whose plane was shot down in WWII

Think of stepping on the shore and finding it heaven,

Of taking hold of a hand and finding it God's hand,

Of breathing a new air and finding it celestial air,

Of being invigorated and finding it immortality,

Of passing from storm and tempest to an unknown

And waking and finding it home

Sister Philomene Tiernan was in the Netherlands last month with 10 other relatives to pay her respects to her uncle, RAAF gunner Patrick Tiernan.

The 75-year-old's sister-in-law, Jillian Tiernan, had been by her side in Europe before the nun farewelled them at the airport in the Netherlands - the same airport Sister Philomene returned to some weeks later to board the doomed Malaysian Airlines flight.

'Phil was so dearly loved by our whole family,' Ms Tiernan told Daily Mail Australia.

'I've spoken with the family who took her to the airport and she said she was in such great spirits and was really looking forward to coming home.

'It's a relief to know that she was in such a happy place. I am so sad for those families who might not have comfort like that.

'The worst part is the not knowing.'

Ms Tiernan shared an incredible bond with Sister Philomene, which began when she was taught by the nun at a catholic girls school in Brisbane.

Sister Philomene attended the commemorative service in the Netherlands some weeks before she herself passed away

'I've known Phil a long time,' she said. 'I met her at school when she was my teacher and then I married her little brother, Dermot.'

Dermot was killed in tragic circumstances back in 1993 when he tried to break up a fight at a pub he owned 270km north-west of Brisbane known as The Australian Hotel.

'It is very sad to have two of our family taken in such tragic circumstances,â€™ Ms Tiernan said of losing her husband and sister-in-law.

'Phil and Dermot were so close - we are all such a close family.

'She was wonderful to all her nieces and nephews, and now grand-nieces and nephews.'

Just a few days before Sister Philomene was killed, she welcomed news of a new grand-niece that had been born.

'I sent Phil photos of little Aislin and she couldn't wait to come back and meet her. She sent emails saying how delighted she was and that she couldn't wait to come home,' Ms Tiernan said.

'I don't think it's fully hit us yet. My son Richard is getting married in December and he called out of the blue and said "she won't be here, she won't be at the wedding". You keep realising more and more what a huge loss she'll be from our lives.'

Ms Tiernan told of a poem Sister Philomene 'held dear to her' and used when she was counselling other people through grief.

The poem's author, Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat, was the founder of the Society of the Sacred Heart - a group that founded three Australian catholic schools where Sister Philomene had worked over the years.

Sister Philomene had visited the poet's grave while she was in Europe.
