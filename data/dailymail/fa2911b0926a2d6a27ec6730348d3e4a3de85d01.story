QPR have signed goalkeeper Alex McCarthy on a four year deal from Championship side Reading after a late bid from Liverpool failed. 

The 24 year-old has signed a deal until 2018 after Rangers agreed a deal for his services which could be worth up to £6million.

McCarthy won three caps for the England under-21s and will wear the No.12 shirt.

Safe hands: Goalkeeper Alex McCarthy has signed for QPR 

Signing on: McCarthy put pen to paper on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee 

QPR boss Harry Redknapp believes the addition of McCarthy to his squad will significantly strengthen his options in the goalkeeping department, commenting: “I am delighted to bring Alex in.

“He’s a great young goalkeeper with a great future in front of him. I think he’s got the potential to be a future England goalkeeper one day, so to have him here at QPR is fantastic.

“We’ve got Rob Green and Brian Murphy, and Alex’s arrival here helps to further strengthen the goalkeeping department.

“I want to have competition for places in all areas of the pitch, and you can’t have too much quality in your squad.

“He is a great signing for the club, and for the future of QPR.”

Moving on: The shot stopper made 75 appearances for Reading in seven years after joining as a trainee 

New surroundings: McCarthy will hope to challenge former England keeper Rob Green for the No.1 shirt 

McCarthy, who will come into contention after the international break, is relishing the opportunity to return to the Premier League under the guidance of Redknapp. 

He said: “I’m over the moon to be back in the Premier League.

“When you’re growing up, all you dream about is playing in the best league in the world – I had a taste of it at Reading, but to be back here now is fantastic.”

Rangers beat off stiff late competition from a number of big Premier League clubs for the keeper’s services and McCarthy revealed why he favoured a move to Loftus Road, adding: “I spoke to Harry a few times and that was probably the icing on the cake for me.

“I’m only 24 and I want to be playing games – there are goalkeepers out there that have sat on the bench and been forgotten about. I don’t want to be one of those. It’s a great challenge for me.”
