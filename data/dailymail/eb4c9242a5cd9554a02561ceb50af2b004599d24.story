Chelsea are to appeal  the red card shown to Nemanja Matic during Saturday's 1-1 draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge.

The Serbia midfielder was sent off for pushing Burnley forward Ashley Barnes after a dangerous foul which manager Jose Mourinho deemed 'criminal' and potentially career ending.

Chelsea have until 1pm on Tuesday to submit their evidence to the Football Association and, if successful, Matic would be allowed to play in Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham.

The appeal will be discussed by a three-person disciplinary commission ahead of the all-London final at Wembley on Sunday.

It comes the day after Mourinho requested to appear on Goals on Sunday to discuss what he feels is a series of injustices against the Barclays Premier League leaders.

Mourinho attacked the reckless challenge by Barnes that went unpunished by referee Martin Atkinson, and insisted Matic's reaction was understandable because it could have ended his career.

'This can be end of career. Matic is a very lucky guy,' Mourinho said. 'I can’t find the word to describe what that player [Barnes] did.

'I can clearly understand that football is about emotions and sometimes you lose emotions. Clearly Matic had a reason to lose his emotions.

'What could be the consequence of his push for the other player? Nothing. The consequence for Matic could be end of career. If you call Diego Costa's actions against Liverpool a crime, the minimum you have to say is this is a criminal tackle.'
