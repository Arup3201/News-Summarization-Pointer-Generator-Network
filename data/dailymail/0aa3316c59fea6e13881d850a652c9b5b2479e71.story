Former footballer and pundit Clarke Carlisle is in hospital after he was hit by a lorry.

The 35-year-old former Leeds, Burnley and QPR defender was airlifted to hospital after being struck by the vehicle on the A64 near Bishopthorpe, North Yorkshire.

 Carlisle, who went on to become chairman of the Professional Footballer's Association and found fame away from the pitch for his appearance on TV show Countdown, was taken to Leeds General Infirmary, where police said he was being treated for 'serious injuries'.

The cause of the accident, which took place at 7.30am this morning remains unclear, however a police spokeswoman said they were 'pursuing all avenues'.

The road was closed to allow the air ambulance to reach the scene, and North Yorkshire police said the incident had involved a lorry and a pedestrian.

Carlisle is considered one of the most intelligent footballers of his generation with 10 Grade A GCSEs.

He also studied maths and politics at A-level while sidelined from football due to injury, and has a degree in Sportswriting and Broadcasting from Staffordshire University.

He made more than 500 appearances for nine clubs in a career that spanned 16 years and became the first player to appear on Channel 4's long-running gameshow Countdown.

Carlisle, who went on to become chairman of the Professional Footballer's Association, has been working as a commentator for ITV since retiring in May 2013

On his first appearance on the programme he beat the reigning champion with a score of 89 to 55, telling then host Jeff Stelling: 'I can't say it's better than winning a big football game - but it's up there.' 

He has also appeared twice on BBC current affairs discussion show Question Time, becoming the first footballer to do so.

In 2002 he was awarded the title ‘Britain’s Brainiest Footballer’ by BBC Sport. His last match was Northampton’s 3–0 defeat by Bradford in the 2013 League Two play-off Final at Wembley in 2013.

Since retiring from the game, he has been a regular pundit on ITV, working at this summer’s World Cup in Brazil and commentating on the Europa League. He is also a leading ambassador for anti-discrimination group Kick It Out. 

He also released his autobiography ‘You don’t know me, but... A footballer’s life’, in which he wrote powerfully about a suicide attempt after suffering a career threatening injury in his playing days. 

Carlisle, who has a wife Gemma and three children, also presented a BBC documentary called ‘Football’s Suicide Secrets’ and has been open about his own battles with depression.

On Monday night, North Yorkshire Police would only confirm that a 35-year-old man was struck by a lorry on the A64 south of York.

'The collision involved a male pedestrian and a lorry,' said a spokesman.

'The injured man has been airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary with serious injuries.

The world of football has pledged its support and best wishes to Carlisle, and social media was full messages from well-wishers hoping he makes a quick recovery.

The Football Association tweeted: 'The thoughts & prayers of all at The FA are with Clarke Carlisle & his family at this sad time.'

One of his former clubs, Burnley, said: 'The thoughts of all at Burnley Football Club are with Clarke Carlisle and his family.'

And the Kick It Out anti-racism campaign posted: 'The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Kick It Out are with Clarke Carlisle and his family. Stay strong our dear friend - keep on fighting.'

Former player and media pundit Kevin Kilbane posted: 'Shocked to hear the news on Clarke Carlisle. I pray for him and his family. Hope he pulls through.'
