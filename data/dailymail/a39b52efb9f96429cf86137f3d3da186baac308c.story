History-maker Nicola Adams got her Commonwealth Games campaign under way with a unanimous points win over Nigerian Oluwatoyin Oladeji in Glasgow on Monday night.

The Olympic gold medallist was made to work hard for her victory, which marked the introduction of women's boxing to the Commonwealth Games programme for the first time.

But the result was never in doubt as Adams used her slick skills to build up a strong points lead and opened up in the last to leave the result in no doubt.

Winner: Nicola Adams beat Nigeria's Oluwatoyin Oladeji in her first bout at the Commonwealth Games

Battle: The Olympic champion was too strong for her opponent throughout

Adams, who became the first Olympic women's boxing champion when she beat China's Cancan Ren at London 2012, said the experience in Glasgow compared well.

The 31-year-old England fighter said: 'I am just happy to be making more history, and to be here fighting in front of a big crowd is an equally special feeling.

'I don't feel any extra pressure because the way I see it if nobody was expecting me to win I would be doing something wrong, so I am just going out there to enjoy it.'

The honour of being the first female boxing winner at a Commonwealth Games went to Northern Ireland 21-year-old Michaela Walsh, who could go on to face Adams in the flyweight final.

Walsh comfortably outpointed Thessa Dumas of Mauritius and said she would relish the opportunity to take on Adams.

Walsh said: 'I would love to have fought her tonight - I don't fear anyone. She might be the golden girl but there's a new golden girl coming.

'I don't think I will meet her until the final but I am confident and I believe that if I perform to the best of my ability nobody can beat me.'
