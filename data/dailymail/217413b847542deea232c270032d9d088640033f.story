Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny has been revealed as the player who has conceded the most penalties in the Premier League since August 2010.

In fact, the Gunners occupy the top two places in the table with goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny second.

Koscielny and Szczesny were tied on six prior to Arsenal's Premier league clash with Chelsea on Sunday but the former pulled ahead after bringing down Eden Hazard in the penalty box.

Hazard converted the spot kick in the 27th minute to give Chelsea the lead before Diego Costa sealed victory 12 minutes from time.

Koscielny also gave away two important penalties in the Premier League last season, one in the 1-0 defeat at Stoke in March, and another in the opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa. 

Although this doesn't count towards this particular statistic, Szczesny also recently gave away a penalty in Arsena's 4-1 Champions League win against Galatasaray last week.

The Pole was sent off after bringing down Burak Yilmaz in the 63rd minute, although the resulting spot kick proved merely to be a consolation for the Turkish side.

Norwich City's Sebastien Bassong, Liverpool's Martin Skrtel and Stoke City's Ryan Shawcross are all tied with five.
