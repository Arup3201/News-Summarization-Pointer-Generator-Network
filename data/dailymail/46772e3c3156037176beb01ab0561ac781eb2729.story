Without immigration British women will have to have 'a lot of children very quickly' to keep the economy and the NHS afloat, a Labour rising star has claimed.

Stella Creasy, 37, said Nigel Farage was 'deeply unpatriotic' because his policies on Europe and immigration were 'basically talking about managing the decline of Britain'.

The unmarried Labour MP said without immigration women already in the UK will have to breed for Britain to support the growing number of pensioners.

Labour rising star Stella Creasy said British women would have to have 'a lot of children very quickly' if the country slashed immigration. She said there were not enough youngsters to support the rapidly ageing population

Miss Creasy said society was 'rife with sexism' and so was politics.

She said the 'Commons and politics is no different' to everywhere else.

The Labour MP said: ‘Parliament, like society, is full of all sorts of unconscious barriers to equality.

'You know, if I hear another person saying that “leadership takes balls”.

'This is not being disrespectful to Mr Balls, but surely we should say leadership is about guts. It’s not gender-specific.’

Miss Creasy, who does not have children, said without a baby boom 'our ability to sustain our economy' will collapse - leaving the NHS in crisis.

The Labour MP's controversial remarks are likely to spark controversy and come just days after the former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont dismissed the claim that immigration was needed to cope with an ageing society.

In a letter to The Times newspaper he cited a House of Lords report that found ‘no evidence. . . that immigration generates significant economic benefit’ and rubbished the claim that migrants were a ‘bulwark against an ageing population’.

He said this would lead to a need for ‘ever escalating levels of immigration’ as the migrants themselves became old and needed more youngsters in the country to look after them as well.

But Miss Creasy said UKIP were a party of hand wringers who complain 'Isn't it awful' while running Britain down.

She said: 'I think Nigel Farage is actually, frankly, deeply unpatriotic because he’s basically talking about managing the decline of Britain.

'He doesn’t seem to think that we can compete with German inventors or that we can compete with the French capital. He seems to have written us off.’

Miss Creasy, appearing on 'This Morning' in August last year, was the victim of vile  online abuse over support for a woman to be featured on a bank note. She also led a successful campaign to force the Government to clamp down on pay day lenders changing sky-high interest rates

She adds: ‘Talk to Nigel Farage not just about the immigrants who come here and create jobs but the immigrants who come here and create skills and create opportunities for people and create new ideas for people.

Miss Creasy said Nigel Farage was 'deeply unpatriotic' because his policies would result in the 'decline' of Britain

‘There are now more people over the age of 65 than under the age of 16 in Britain.

‘So unless women like me have a lot of children very quickly our ability to sustain our economy, to sustain our public services [will come under threat].

'It’s not just that these guys want to charge you to use the NHS, it’s that their policies will actually mean the NHS will not exist by [Britain] not being able to have an economy than can support it.’

Miss Creasy said unlike UKIP she was 'incredibly optimistic about the future’.

But she warned that the amount of debt families were taking on could cause the economy to crash.

She said: ‘We have this big bubble of personal debt coming up and … it will drag us all down.

‘We have to stop being British and coy about talking about debt because that’s where these companies do well, [it] is people feeling ashamed.

'It can’t be a silent source of shame any more, it’s got to be something we talk about and which we manage together as a community.’

Miss Creasy also hit out at left wingers in her party who are angry at plans to make cuts to reduce the deficit.

She said: ‘If we get our economy wrong, it’s the poorest who miss out and they pay the most comparatively in taxes.'

She added: ‘Everyone’s very negative about this idea that we’re going to face difficult financial challenges.' She sees instead the chance to ‘reshape services to get better outcomes for people. Actually it will be cheaper.’
