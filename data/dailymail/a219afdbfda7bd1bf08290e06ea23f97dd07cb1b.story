Tragedy: Rhiannon Priestley was hit by 10 vehicles while trying to get help after a crash

A young woman survived a horror car crash only to be tragically killed when she was hit by up to 10 vehicles while trying to get help.

Rhiannon Priestley lost control of her car on the M4 near Bristol and veered across two lanes of traffic, before crashing down the verge and into a tree with 'considerable force', an inquest heard.

The 20-year-old's black Volkswagon Polo then flipped on to its roof, leaving her with head injuries, on the westbound carriageway near junction 19 on October 13 last year.

Records show she may have been on her 
mobile phone at the time of the accident and a toxicology report found 
evidence of cocaine in her system.

About half an hour after coming off the road, the fashion retail assistant pulled herself from the wreckage and walked up the verge, Avon Coroner's Court heard.

But it is believed she became disorientated while trying to get help from other drivers on the motorway and ran on to the road.

She was struck by two oncoming cars and knocked to the ground.

Up to eight other vehicles then ran over Miss Priestley as she lay on the slip road. It is not known which collision caused her death.

Miss Priestley had spent the evening with friends in Bath, Somerset. She left at about 8.30pm, with friends believing she was returning to the home she shared with her parents in Batheaston.

But CCTV images captured Miss Priestley 
driving along the M4 towards Bristol at around midnight. It is not known how fast she was driving.

Phone
records show Miss Priestley had a conversation with her boyfriend at 12.08am. The court heard she had argued with him earlier that evening.

Police attempts to take a statement from her boyfriend had not been successful, the inquest was told.

Pc
David Watson, a collision investigator at Avon and Somerset Police, 
said: 'The conversation terminated less than five minutes later.

'Despite repeated calls and text messages, Miss Priestley did not respond.

'CCTV footage shows 
Rhiannon at 12.12am travelling in lane three, who then swerved for an 
unknown reason and left the carriageway and went on to the grass verge.

'The location of the car and the extent of its damage suggests that it had struck a tree with considerable force.'

Blood
was found on the airbag suggesting she suffered head or facial injuries, but managed to escape the wreckage at about 12.44am.

Pc Watson added: 'There
was evidence of some injury to her head or face. She exited her car, 
probably via the driver door and climbed up the grass verge.

'It
is likely she was going to ask for assistance from other motorists, she
may have been disorientated as she approached the edge of the 
motorway.'

Miss Priestley  was first 'brushed' by 
driver Andrew Maybee in his Vauxhall car, before being hit by Miguel Andrews
in his Daihatsu van at around 12.48am.

Mr Andrews told the court: 'All of a sudden I saw somebody ran towards the car. It was so fast I didn’t have time to react.

'It just looked as if they were running in panic. It was so quick I couldn’t process what was happening before the impact.'

Mr Andrews added he pulled over and saw the front of his vehicle was damaged.

Miss Priestley was pushed onto the slip road of the motorway by the force of the collision.

Up to eight other vehicles then drove over Miss Priestley, as she lay on the slip road, unable to see her in the darkness.

Avon Coroner Maria Voisin said a postmortem examination showed Miss Priestley died from multiple injuries.

Toxicology tests found she had 'recent exposure' to cocaine, though it was not possible to establish how much she had taken. There were no traces of alcohol in her system.

The coroner recorded a verdict of death by road traffic collision.

Speaking outside the court, Miss Priestley’s father Will said the family were devastated by her death.

'The loss of Rhiannon is unbearable We will never understand why Rhi and many other alike are taken,' he said.

'Fortunately for us Rhiannon has three older sisters and our family remains strong.

'But all of us, together with her many friends who sincerely loved her, are still feeling immense pain.

'There were a number of factors which conspired on the night to cause the accident and for whatever reason Rhiannon was not fortunate to get a second chance.'
