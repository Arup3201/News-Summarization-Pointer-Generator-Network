Erik Lamela cost Tottenham £30million. If his goal against Asteras Tripoli on Thursday night is replayed 30 million times, it still wouldn't be enough.

When his rabona strike from the edge of the area flew past Tomas Kosicky, those at White Hart Lane had to double-take.

Thank God for television replays; because one particular piece of footage will be shown again, and again, and again.

And breathe.... what a crazy ending at White Hart Lane. Spurs' first victory in the tournament moves them up to second in their group. Tottenham would be top on goal difference if it wasn't for Kane's error as Besiktas beat Partizan Belgrade 4-0 in the other match.

What a game at White Hart Lane. Lloris is sent off for bringing Tsokanis down, Harry Kane goes in goal to a huge ovation from the Spurs fans, then fumbles Jeronimo (Geronimoooo!) Barrales' free-kick into the net. The whole crowd gives another standing ovation. Crazy, crazy game.

The referee brings an end to an eventful match at White Hart Lane. Harry Kane will hit the headlines for his hat-trick and his error to allow Asteras' pull back a consolation when in goal. Despite Kane's heroics undoubtedly the magic moment of the match came from Lamela and his first half 'rabona' strike. That was something special.

The sight of Kane in goal has given the Greek side a boost as they all eye-up the following free kick on the edge of the box. Barrales shoots low and hard and the ball squirms under Kane's grasp, before trickling into the bottom corner for a comical goal. An unfortunate ending to Kane's night but he'll still be taking the match ball home.

Tottenham's high line is made to pay at last. Hugo Lloris is shown a straight red card for his last man challenge. Hat-trick hero Kane has gone in goal with Spurs having made all their substitutes...

What a night for this young man as he completes his hat-trick. Fazio whips in a cross and the striker was on hand to head home. Andros Townsend is replaced by Aaron Lennon.

80 mins: Asteras make a change with Parra replaced by Nicolas Fernandez.

In among the celebrations Tottenham boss Pochettino brings off Lamela who is replaced by Christian Eriksen. Lamela has put in a display of quality for Spurs tonight and will be delighted with his performance. Nacir Chadli comes on for Emmanuel Adebayor.

A night of superlatives at White Hart Lane. Lamela's rabona, his blistering second, Kane's fantastic finish and to top it all off, a world class save from Hugo Lloris. Spurs fans who stayed at home have missed out.

Game over. Moussa Dembele fires a low left-footed strike which Kosicky can only spill into the path of Kane who taps home. Spurs have been clinical tonight.

73 mins: The Greek outfit make their first substitute of the match with Jeronimo Barrales replacing Rolle in a like-for-like switch in attack.

68 mins: Asteras have been threatening all match and would have pulled one back but for the brilliance of Lloris in the Tottenham goalkeeper. Martin Rolle plays a beautifulyl dinked ball into the path of Fernando Usero who's brilliant acrobatic effort is tipped behind for a corner. The scoreline flatters Spurs as the hosts have created a few chances of their own.

He really is the man of the moment right now. Lamela evades the tackle of three or four players before attempting a lay-off inside the box. His attempted pass is blocked and ricochets up in the air. Instinctively he hits a crisp first-time volley that beats Kosicky at his near post. Another fantastic goal from Lamela. 

60 mins: For their defensive worries, Tottenham are still looking menancing going forward and create another chance this time through Kane who sees his shot parried away by Kosicky in the Asteras goal.

58mins: Tottenham's high line is being brutally being exposed by the visitors at the moment. The Greek outfit are breaking with pace and sooner or later they may make Spurs pay. This game isn't over yet.

48 mins: Right on cue Tottenham's No 11 nearly delivers. Townsend's deep cross finds Adebayor who heads down into the path of Lamela but his strike is blocked for a corner.

We're back underway in north London. Will there be some more Lamela magic?

Besiktas are 2-0 up away to Partizan Belgrade. As things stand the Turkish side are top of the group on goal difference ahead of Spurs - with both sides on five points from three games.

The referee brings a close to a dominant first half display by Tottenham. Harry Kane's great opener won't be spoken about by the White Hart Lane faithful - with all the talk going towards Lamela's stunning second. A real 'I was there' moment for those inside the ground.

38 mins: Harry Kane is at the heart of the majority of everything that Spurs are doing well. The striker wins a tackle and lays off a pass into Townsend who curls a left-footed strike a yard outside the post from long range.

35 mins: First caution of the night goes to Asteras defender Thanasis Panteliadis who unceremonisly chops down Andros Townsend in the middle of the pitch.

Unbelievable goal by Erik Lamela. A rabona (if you don't know what that is, watch one of the 1,375,885 YouTube videos) from 20 yards, perfectly curled past the curiously named Tomas Kosicky in the Asteras net. It's gone quiet again at White Hart Lane, I don't think anyone can quite believe it...

There's a damp atmosphere at White Hart Lane tonight. Understandably. If ever there was an example of why the Champions League is better than the Europa League, this is it. Well, apart from that goal from Lamela!

What. A. Goal. Erik Lamela has scored one of the goals of the season across the planet. The ball falls to the Argentina international on the edge of the box on his weaker right foot. Instead of hitting it with his right, the midfielder instead chooses to perform a 'rabona' and wrap his left foot around the ball. The end result? A truly stunning strike that bends into the far corner. Pochettino motionless. Fantastic goal.

The reason why Tottenham failed to beat Besiktas was to due to defensive lapses and it appears they haven't learned from their mistakes. Forward Facundo Parra delightfully collects a pass inside the Tottenham box. His first effort is brilliantly stopped by Hugo Lloris in goal before his second effort is thrwated once more. A warning sign for Spurs.

23 mins: Spurs nearly double their advantage. Etienne Capoue is played through by Kane but the France midfielder is unable to adjust his feet in time and clear the danger Asteras Tripolis.

18 mins: The goal has given Tottenham a firm grip on the game. The home fans are in full voice.

13 mins: He scored Tottenham's opener against Besiktas in their last Europa League match at White Hart Lane and he's done it again. Harry Kane picks up the ball from the 25 yards out and fires a low right-footed strike into the bottom corner. A brilliant strike from the young striker. Tottenham looking good so far.

Here at White Hart Lane the fans haven't exactly turned out in force for this crucial clash… it looks about 70 per cent capacity. Mauricio Pochettino has made six changes to the side that lost 4-1 to Manchester City. Thats a grand total of 42 players in Spurs' five Europa League games so far.

5 mins: Asteras Tripolis sit top of Group C and show a glimpse of why. Following a Tottenham free-kick the champions break and a long pass finds Pablo Mazza who takes a touch before dragging a shot wide. Tottenham have started well but need to be on their guard if they are to record their first victory of the tournament.

Tottenham get proceedings underway. Game on.

Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham Hotspur can expect to win major silverware within two years but warned of suffering in store in the meantime.

The Spurs manager said: ‘Sometimes to change something you need time. You need to suffer and have the bad moments. We know we’re heading in the right direction.

‘It may be in six months, one year, or two years. But I’m sure in the end the club will achieve a very important trophy.’

He's young, he's English, and he's a centre forward. But Harry Kane is still underrated.

'I have always believed in Harry since the first day… he has a very strong mind and is a very good player.'

These were Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino's words in August, and events since will have only strengthened his confidence in the 21-year-old.
