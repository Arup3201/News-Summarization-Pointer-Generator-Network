The lawyer for a 17-year-old Connecticut boy charged with stabbing a classmate to death in school on their prom day says he intends to use an insanity defense.

Christopher Plaskon is charged with murdering 16-year-old Maren Sanchez in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School in Milford in April 2014, just hours before the junior prom. 

Police are investigating whether it was related to Sanchez's refusal to be Plaskon's prom date.

Plaskon's lawyer, Richard Meehan, released new court documents on Monday saying he intends to pursue a defense of 'mental disease or defect and/or extreme emotional disturbance.'

Meehan has said in court that Plaskon was taking anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety medications.

Plaskon is due in Milford Superior Court for a pretrial hearing on Tuesday.

Sanchez, 16, was a member of the National Honor Society who was active in drama and other school activities.

She had organized the dance herself and was set to be prom queen, her friends said. 

A witness saw Plaskon on top of Sanchez during the attack and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away, and another saw him discard a bloody knife, according to a police affidavit.

Plaskon, his clothes bloody, was taken to the principal's office, where an officer arrived and asked what happened. 

'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied, according to the officer.

He is being prosecuted as an adult and faces up to 60 years in prison with a mandatory minimum of 25 years if found guilty of murder.
