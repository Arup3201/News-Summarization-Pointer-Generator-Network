Brisbane locals are embracing the G20 world meet up with characteristic Queensland humour, as enterprising local businesses celebrate the visit with special events and limited edition culinary specials.

Popular Brisbane bar, Alfred & Constanc,  held an Obamarama Tiki Party in honour of President Barack Obama – dedicating 'The Big O' pineapple cocktail to his Hawaiian roots and the Obamarama burger to him for his love of burgers.

'We are having the Obamarama party to welcome President Obama to Brisbane and show him how we, as Queenslanders relax and celebrate,' said Emily Wornes, duty manager.

London-born chef Martin Latter will be dishing up over 100,000 meals for some of the world's most influential leaders during the G20 summit, held at the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre 

'We thought he'd be a little bit stressed after the conference [G20] so we wanted to create an atmosphere where he could let his hair down. 

'We know that he is from Hawaii so we thought why not make him feel at home? Give him a lei, a Piña Colada, an Obamarama Burger and help him chill out.'  

Damien Draper, Head Chef at Brisbane's Pony Dining has also created a burger especially for the US President. 

'We pretty much wanted to throw everything that was quintessential American burger into a hamburger,' Mr Draper said. 

'It's got the patty, it's got the American mustard, it's got the cheddar cheese, pickles, onion rings and a smoked BBQ sauce'.

'I'd be very surprised if he [Barack Obama] is walking around town looking for somewhere to eat but if he is, it would be great to have him in here, we'd really love it', he said. 

Meanwhile in at the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre, Executive Chef Martin Latter – born and trained in UK - is preparing for one of the biggest weeks of his career.

He will be dishing up over 100,000 meals for some of the world's most influential leaders during the upcoming G20 Summit.

'We created a very special menu here for the G20 leaders. I have sourced every ingredient from Queensland and we are giving [the delegates] some absolutely stunning seafood,' said the London-born Mr Latter.  

 'I've created a very special dessert which showcases all the flavours and textures of Queensland as well.

'I've been very fortunate to cook for a lot of royals and previous UK Prime Ministers so it would be an honour to cook for Prime Minister David Cameron.

I look forward to showcasing him some of Queensland's finest produce.'

An avid Chelsea supporter, Martin also expressed that he would still love to invite the Aston Villa fan for a pint in his Brisbane local, if he did have some downtime during or after the summit.

'David Cameron supports the wrong team in London; we will take him for a pint across the road and watch the Chelsea game on Saturday night.'
