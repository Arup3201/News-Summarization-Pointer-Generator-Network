One unusual and extraordinary school is giving hope to the most troubled and violent pupils.

The Ian Mikardo High School is a last chance education centre for children excluded from mainstream education. It's a place where daily fights, spitting, and cursing are all part of the attempts to teach some of the most challenging children in the country, and turn their behaviour around before it is too late.

The school, situated in East London, is often seen as the end of the line for the pupils, many of whom have a range of behavioural problems and risk ending up in jail.

Out of control: Classes at The Ian Mikardo High School often descend into chaos, with pupils fighting either staff or each other

Boys can arrive at any time during their secondary education, usually after being expelled from a mainstream school. 

Now the subject of a Channel 5 documentary 'Too tough to teach', viewers are able to see the fraught atmosphere in which classes are taught.

Play fights escalate within seconds, turning to real violence as the boys throw punches and teachers attempt to intervene.

One incident sees a teacher attempting to talk a boy through his work as another verbally abuses him, swearing and spitting on his head.

In another lesson a pupil physically hits sheets of paper out of the teachers hand, swearing in her face while another boy lifts a chair above his head in a menacing manner, while the rest of the class run riot as the staff desperately attempt to regain order and focus the boys on their work. 

Ray, 14, was permanently excluded from his school for unprovoked physical attacks on teachers and pupils.

Like many of the boys at the Ian Mikardo High School, Ray has a difficult home life.

The eldest of five children, Ray lives with his siblings and single mother Rowshan in a two bedroom council flat just one mile from the school.

Surrounded by piles of boxes and belongings, Ray's tiny bed is squeezed into a box room he shares with his brother, while his mother shares a double bed with his three sisters, sleeping sideways to create enough space. 

The flat is the third temporary home Ray has lived in and the family may be moved on at any time.

No detentions: Despite the extremely challenging pupils, head teacher Claire Lillis runs the school without any official system of punishment

‘Ray has a huge amount of issues that he’s currently dealing with,' explains head teacher Claire Lillis.'Given the context of his life outside of school, for some boys it is incredible that they have actually made it here in the first place.

‘What concerns me about Ray is he is clearly very physically strong. Being able to express himself verbally and being able to communicate and express his emotions is something he finds exceptionally difficult. He could end up really seriously hurting someone.'

A keen boxer, Ray devotes up to three hours a day after school to his training, but is unable to prevent his fighting skills from spilling over into the classroom.

‘Ray uses his shadow boxing when he's in a state of anxiety. I think his release is going into that momentum and he gets that close to staff or other students and you think, this isn't healthy,' Claire explains.

‘I've wanted to be a boxer since I was little. I want to be on TV, I want money and sick cars and a mansion,' Ray says, later, in a brief moment of calm, confessing to a teacher that he intends to give all the money from his first big win to his mother.

A talented boxer, Ray - seen here 'play punching' a teacher- finds it difficult to express himself in any way other than violence

Like the other boys at the school, Ray engages in fighting of both a verbal and physical nature on a near daily basis, as well as being easily distracted during lessons.

However, despite the extremely challenging pupils, head teacher Claire runs the school without any official system of punishment.

There are no detentions or rewards and the boys are never physically restrained. Instead the school attempts to help the boys learn to control their own actions and focuses on conflict resolution.

Claire explains: 'If we intervene and if we restrain they are reliant on us for literally holding them back, but what we are trying to do is for them to find their own breaks.'

Sanctuary: Time  in a salon is one of the most peaceful for Ray, and where he is most likely to open up

As well as attempting to change his behaviours through teaching the boys how to handle their emotions more appropriately, the school uses more unconventional methods.

In addition to art and design classes, it has a full salon within the building, where as well as learning hair cutting skills, boys can enjoy full facials and manicures.

Time out in the salon is one of the most peaceful for Ray, apparently allowing him to lower his boundaries for a short period.

And after a few months at Ian Mikardo, improvements begin to show in Ray's demeanour.

Though he still often turns to violence to express himself, he is sent on a week's work experience to a local gym and is not only able to control his temper, but manages to communicate well with clients and other staff, gaining praise for his work at the end of the week.

‘What we want to do is channel Rays passion for boxing. It’s something that he loves and something that he excels at, but we also want to show him that there’s a broader world than boxing as well,' Claire says.

Too Tough to Teach airs this evening at 9pm on Channel 5
