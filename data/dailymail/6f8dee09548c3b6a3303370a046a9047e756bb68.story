Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has been fined £20,000 for smoking in the showers after a game.

The 24-year-old left boss Arsene Wenger furious when he was caught lighting up after his nightmare performance in the 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day.

Szczesny was forced to apologise for his behaviour – and it is unclear whether he might also be axed from this week’s Barclays Premier League clash at home to bogey side Stoke.

David Ospina was in goal for the FA Cup win over Hull on Sunday and kept a clean sheet – with Szczesny not even picked on the bench.

That may have been pre-planned – the Polish keeper didn’t play in any of Arsenal’s domestic cup games last season. 

But Former Arsenal star John Jensen had claimed on Danish TV that Szczesny, 24, had suffered a bitter fall-out with Wenger and would not play again this season, although Arsenal denied that allegation and said Szczesny remains part of their first-team plans. 

Szczesny is not the first Arsenal player to get into trouble for smoking.

Last year, Jack Wilshere admitted his behaviour was 'unacceptable' after being pictured smoking at a pool party in Las Vegas.

He was summoned to explain himself to Arsene Wenger and said later: 'The smoking? Of course I regret it.

'I've been seen doing it. I said it was a mistake and I have made a mistake again. I'm young and I'll learn from it. It's unacceptable and I will accept the consequences and I will move on.'

Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski, 29, has completed his move to Inter Milan on loan until the end of the season.
