Liverpool defender Martin Kelly will complete a surprise £1.5m switch to Crystal Palace on Tuesday.

The 24-year-old and his representatives held talks with Palace officials on Monday and wrapped up the deal Tuesday morning.

The Whiston-born full-back has made more than 30 senior appearances for the Reds since breaking into the first-team squad in 2007.

Shock move: Liverpool defender Martin Kelly (right) is set to sign for Crystal Palace in a £1.5million deal

But he has struggled with injury and spent a year on the sidelines after damaging his knee in a Premier League clash against Manchester United at the start of the 2012 season.

Kelly did not start a single game as Brendan Rodgers’ side fought for the title last season.

But he recently spoke of his desire to prove his long-term fitness this season and said: 'I think in terms of confidence and feeling strong I’m definitely 100 per cent, but in longer terms that takes games.

'I've been fit for a season now but I haven't had the games, so the run of games is vital for me this season.'
