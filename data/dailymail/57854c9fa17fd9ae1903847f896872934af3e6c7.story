Ukrainian outfit Shakhtar Donetsk have revealed that two explosions caused damage to their stadium early on Saturday morning.

The north-western side of the Donbass Arena was affected by the two blasts, thankfully with no casualties among stadium staff.

An official statement on Shakhtar's website read: 'On 23 August, at 6:00, two powerful explosions occurred at Donbass Arena.

Wreckage: Vast amounts of damage have been caused to the north western side of the ground

Mess: Shaktar's home ground has been heavily affected by the blasts

Terrible: Shaktar's ground looks a sorry state of affairs at the moment

'As a result of shelling, there are numerous damages of the northwestern facade of the stadium, communications, equipment and detached building of the energy centre, which is located in the northern part of the Donbass Arena park.

'There are no casualties among the stadium staff.'

Despite this it will not affect Shakhtar's matchday schedule for home games, with them being forced to play in Lviv for the upcoming season due to regular occurrences of violence in the past at the Donbass Arena.

England played two of their Euro 2012 group matches against France and Ukraine at the same stadium.
