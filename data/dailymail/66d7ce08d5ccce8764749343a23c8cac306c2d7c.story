The eighth and final Harry Potter film, and the first to be shown in 3D, premieres tonight in London - but the question is, how many cinemagoers will be willing to fork out extra to see it in all its multi-dimensional glory?

While 3D films are billed as the ultimate viewing experience, it seems movie fans are increasingly becoming content to continue watching films the old-fashioned way, in 2D.

A massive 80 per cent of viewers chose to watch James Cameron's record-breaking Avatar in 3D when it was released in 2009. 

But the fact that a mere 38 per cent of 
the U.S. box office take for recent blockbuster smash Pirates Of The 
Caribbean: On Stranger Tides came from 3D tickets highlights how out of 
favour the genre has become.

Specs appeal: The latest box office figures show that cinemagoers are reluctant to pay extra for 3D tickets

Kung Fu Panda 2 was released in the U.S. on Memorial Day weekend at the end of May, a popular time to see films at the cinema in America, but more people watched in 2D rather than 3D and it has earned the nickname '3Disaster'.

The latest box office figures show that the British are following their American counterparts in a reluctance to pay extra for 3D tickets.

The major cinema groups are charging customers of 3D films up to 41 per cent more than those seeing standard films.

This means families of four could face paying nearly £11 more to watch a film in 3D.

Cinema firms, including Odeon and Cineworld, charge up to £1 per person on top of the ticket price to pay for 3D glasses.

'It is difficult when some 3D films are not very high quality,' Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of the Vue cinema chain, said recently.

'In the past 12 to 18 months, in this Tweeting world we live in, word gets round pretty quickly if the 3D is not up to scratch.'

On top of the added cost, significant numbers of cinema-goers feel sick when watching 3D films, especially in cinemas not specially adapted for the format, and children, in particular, can struggle with uncomfortable 3D glasses.

The box office takings of Yogi, the Warner Bros film version of the children's classic television cartoon Yogi Bear, were split nearly equally between 2D and 3D.

Disney's Tangled, a reworking of the Rapunzel fairy tale, saw 44 per cent of its takings come from 2D cinemas, with the remainder from 3D.

When the extra charged for 3D tickets is taken into account, it seems more people are watching some of these films in 2D.
