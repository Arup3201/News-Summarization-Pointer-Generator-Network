Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand has been banned from driving - after being caught speeding on the same road three times in less than six weeks.

The 33-year-old defender, who has played 81 times for England, was given a six-month ban despite being represented by lawyer Nick Freeman, nicknamed Mr Loophole for his ability to get celebrities off driving charges.

Mr Freeman argued that Ferdinand had no idea he was on the verge of being disqualified when he was caught driving a Jaguar XJ at 38mph in a 30mph zone on Chester Road in Stretford, near Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium.

The car was registered to Jaguar, and the luxury car company had received notifications of two earlier offences but had not forwarded them on, the lawyer told Trafford Magistrates' Court.

The footballer already had three points on his licence from a previous matter.

But he was oblivious to the fact that the figure had trebled to nine before the final offence, Mr Freeman said.

'He was a victim of the modern day detection system,' the lawyer told magistrates.

Ferdinand was caught twice by the same camera on Chester Road in January and once by another nearby at 2.20pm on February 9.

Mr Freeman claimed that, had Ferdinand been stopped by an officer and made aware of the offence, he would not have repeated it.

He said: 'The adrenalin would have kicked in, he would have had sweaty palms and he would not have done it again.'

Mr Freeman, who has represented Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the past, admitted that a defence of hardship could not be argued as Ferdinand clearly had the means to afford a driver.

However, the lawyer pointed out that a lengthy ban would prevent the footballer from spending 'quality time' with his two sons, aged six and four, who he drives to school.

Mr Freeman said that his client wanted to keep his children as grounded as possible and not spoil them and that the 'dynamics of their relationship' would change if he was banned.

He also argued that a short ban would leave Ferdinand on nine points with the threat of a ban hanging over him whereas a six-month penalty would hand him back a clean licence.

But magistrates declined to take up this offer and imposed the ban.

The footballer, who was not in court, was also ordered to a £500 fine, £35 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Freeman said: 'I will reflect upon the magistrates’ decision and advise my client accordingly.'

Ferdinand today rebuffed offers of a chauffeur after details of the case were widely reported.

Reacting to the ban on his official Twitter account, Ferdinand wrote: 'Didn't know so many drivers followed me!! Thanks for the offers but I'm cool, I'm sorted on the drivers front. #speedkills'.

Manchester United declined to comment on the case.

Ferdinand's ban comes only a week after Mr Freeman represented another Manchester United footballer, Danny Welbeck, who was caught doing 82mph in a 50mph zone.

Welbeck, 21, escaped a ban and was ordered to pay £60 for the offence in the Northenden area of Manchester last November.

Ferdinand is the fourth top footballer to be prosecuted for driving offences in the last fortnight.

In addition to the Welbeck case, Manchester City midfielder Michael Johnson has been banned for drink driving and former Arsenal star Patrick Vieira was disqualified for speeding.
