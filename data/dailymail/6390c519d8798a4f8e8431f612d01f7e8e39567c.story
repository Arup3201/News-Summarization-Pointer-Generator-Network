Di Maria told ESPN Radio: 'The truth is that I have a great relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo and I stayed at Madrid last season thanks to him.

'I left Madrid in the best possible way, by winning La Decima. In my farewell letter, I said exactly how I felt from the first day at the Bernabeu.'

The 26-year-old signed for United for a £60million British record feem signing a five-year deal with the Old Trafford club.

Di Maria recently penned an open letter to Madrid fans following his departure.

In the letter, published by Spanish newspaper Marca, Di Maria said: ‘Unfortunately today I have to go, but I want to make clear that this was never my desire.

£147.1m - Amount spent by United in the summer transfer window, more than any other team in the country

200 - Goals scored by Falcao during his club career

£10m - United’s net spend this summer is around £10million higher than Jose Mourinho’s entire net spend in his two spells at Chelsea

‘As anyone who works, I’ve always wanted to progress. After winning ‘La Decima’ I went to the World Cup with the hope of receiving a new contract, which never came.

‘Many things and many lies were spoken. They always wanted to attribute the initiative to me to leave the club, but I did not. The only thing I asked for is something that would be fair.

He added: ‘I’ve been lucky enough to share a dressing room with fantastic players, who have been even better companions.

‘I think that was the key to La Decima. I want to apologize for the times I was wrong, on or off the pitch. It was never my intention to harm anyone.

‘I sweated for this shirt in every game as if it was my last. There were times when things went for me and others not, but what I can say is that I always gave everything.’
