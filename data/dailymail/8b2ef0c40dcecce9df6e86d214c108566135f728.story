Sam Allardyce believes Winston Reid could make a U-turn and decide to stay at West Ham if they qualify for Europe.

As it stands the West Ham manager is resigned to losing his key centre-back when he is out of contract in the summer.

But West Ham are still in the hunt for a Champions League or Europa League place, currently sitting seventh in the table only three points off Manchester United in fourth.

Arsenal and Liverpool are both interested in signing Reid when his contract runs out this summer 

'I think that the way the club has improved I think with him staying and what we've done this season - and hopefully finish the season strongly - might persuade him to sign for us,' Allardyce said.

'We're on the up at the moment and we've got a very big future ahead of us, moving into the new stadium so the club could be bigger than it has ever been in the next four to five years.'

Allardyce is standing firm in his unwillingness to sell the player on the cheap during the January transfer window – with Arsenal and Liverpool both interested – which would leave Reid with a decision to make at the end of this campaign.

Hammers manager Sam Allardyce believes Reid will stay with the club if they reach Europe this season 

'There's no choice for me, he stays and that's it,' Allardyce insisted. 'It would have to be a big offer but whether somebody makes a big offer then obviously the chairman decides then. But for me, he's staying . The chairman decides whether the money's big enough but for me, he stays.'

Allardyce also ruled out moving for out-of-favour Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic. West Ham had discussions about trying to sign the centre-back in summer, but he ended up staying at City where he has only managed one appearance, in the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal.

Allardyce added: 'I don't think Nastasic wants to stay in this country is my opinion based on the talks about Nastasic I had last summer before the window shut. The word was that is he was going to leave Manchester City then he wouldn' t stay in this country.'
