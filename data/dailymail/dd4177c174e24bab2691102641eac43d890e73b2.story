A nurse accidentally turned off the life support machine of a paralysed patient, leaving him permanently brain-damaged, a misconduct hearing was told today.

Violeta Aylward, was not qualified to look after Jamie Merrett, who was paralysed from the neck down following a road traffic accident in March 2002.

Mr
Merrett, who requires 24-hour care, was left permanently brain damaged 
after his brain was starved off oxygen for up to 21 minutes.

Caught on camera: Mr Merrett had been so worried about the care he was receiving he set up a camera at his home - it captured nurse Violetta Aylward switching off Mr Merritt's ventilator - it was 21 minutes before a paramedic helped turn it back on

Miss Aylward eventually realises something is wrong and calls for the care assistant on duty, who asks: 'What have you done?', before calling 999

The then 
37-year-old had been so worried about the care he was receiving he set 
up a camera at his home in Devizes, Wiltshire, following previous 
problems with his ventilator.

But just days into looking 
after him Aylward, a learning disabilities nurse without proper medical 
training, was caught on film turning off the machine.

Footage
from the camera, which he had put in to guard against poor care, shows 
her grabbing the resuscitation machine and shouting, ‘What do I do with 
this?’ before paramedics were called to save him.

Mr Merrett, who requires 24-hour 
care, was left permanently brain damaged after his brain was starved off
oxygen for up to 21 minutes. 

Violeta
Aylward is a Filipino learning disabilities nurse who had not worked in
intensive care and was not trained to manage a ventilated patient.

Mr Merrett who suffered severe brain damage, was shown in a BBC documentary struggling to say his name - his sister Karren Reynolds right, attended the misconduct hearing today

Although Mr Merritt was paralysed from the neck down and dependent on a ventilator, he could operate a wheelchair and remained mentally alert, using a voice-activated computer to manage his own affairs and study languages.

He had warned NHS Wiltshire, which funded his care, that staff twice previously failed to connect his ventilator properly.

When he had the camera installed in 
January 2009, Mr Merrett needed 24-hour care from nurses trained to look
after a ventilated patient with intensive care experience.

A notice stuck beneath the camera read: ‘This is my webcam. It is for my family to see that I am safe. It is recording.’

Footage
shows Miss Aylward approach the ventilator and push a button once which
starts an alarm beeping and a red light flashing.

She then pushes the button again, switching off the machine and cutting off the oxygen supply. Mr Merrett, who cannot speak as he is starved of air, clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth – a warning sound ventilated patients are told to make in an emergency.

Miss Aylward eventually realises something is wrong and calls for the care assistant on duty, who asks: ‘What have you done?’, before calling 999.

Miss Aylward is seen floundering with the resuscitation equipment. Instead of connecting it to the hole in Mr Merrett’s neck she puts it in his mouth.

She calls out: ‘How do you do this?’ She then urges her patient: ‘Jamie breathe please.’

Paramedics restarted the machine after 21 minutes but by then Mr Merrett suffered severe brain damage.

Aylward, of Reading, now faces being struck off the nursing register after being charged with failing to provide adequate care to Mr Merrett and working when she was not competent to do so.

Wiltshire Primary Care Trust were responsible for commissioning Mr Merrett’s care but had to subcontract it out to nursing agencies due to a lack of staff.

Neil Moloney, for the Nursing and Midwifery Council, said Aylward was employed by Ambition 24 Hours Nursing Agency to provide care to Mr Merrett.

Her first shift was on December 23 2008 during which she raised no concerns.

She worked three further shifts over the Christmas and New Year period with no problems.

But it was during a night shift on January 8 2009 that Aylward turned off Mr Merrett’s ventilator after checking its settings.

Mr Moloney said: 'At approximately 8.15pm an incident occurred where the registrant switched off Patient A’s ventilator.

'On two previous occasions Patient A had experience significant failings with the nursing care of his ventilator and was very anxious about the re-occurrence of such an incident so therefore installed CCTV in his room.

'The CCTV footage was reviewed following the incident. At around 8.05pm the registrant went into Patient A’s room to undertake observations.

'She left the room and returned shortly afterwards to check the ventilator settings.

'She is seen to push several buttons and after a few moments a red light appeared and the alarm was activated.

'The registrant continues to push buttons in an attempt to turn it back on and calls to care assistant Mercedes Creed in to the room for assistance.”

Care assistant Miss Creed then told Aylward to start resuscitation using an Ambubag while she went to call 999.

The footage shows Aylward attempt to do mouth-to-mouth on the patient despite the fact the Ambubag should be used on his tracheotomy.

Within minutes a paramedic from a first response team arrived and took over and two further paramedics in an ambulance followed.

Mr Merrett rushed to Salisbury Hospital Intensive Care Unit but by that point he had already suffered permanent brain damage.

Mr Moloney said Aylward was employed to look after Mr Merrett despite not having the proper training to do so.

'The agency were aware of the requirements that the nurse must have Intensive Care Unit training or experience.

'The registrant was on the books as a registered learning disabilities nurse, not a register general nurse. She did not have ITU training or experience.

An investigation by Wilshire County Council, who run the local Primary Care Trust, and the police followed but it was decided there was insufficient evidence to pursue a charge of Grievous Bodily Harm.

Aylward, who is not attending the hearing due to ill health, faces being struck off it a fitness to practise panel find her guilty of misconduct.

The hearing in central London continues.
