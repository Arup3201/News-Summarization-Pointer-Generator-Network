Three other people, including the Garcias' teenage passengers and the driver of the other vehicle, were injured in the crash and required hospitalization, reported KTLA.

The collision took place about three blocks from Banning High School, which both the Garcia siblings attended.

According to investigators, surveillance video taken from a nearby business showed the Garcias’ red sedan speeding in the wrong direction and possibly racing a dark-colored truck also going against traffic.  

Lexi and Eli were inseparable and even called themselves twins

Heartbroken friends and family of the Garcia siblings have been flocking to the site of the accident, leaving flowers, candles and money for their funeral.  

Investigators say Elexis was speeding against traffic when she lost control of the car belonging to her boyfriend and careened into a white ride-share van.

The driver  suffered minor injuries.

Police are now looking for the dark truck that may have been street racing with the Garcias at the time of the crash.

According to surveillance video and witness accounts, Elexis and Elias’ mother rushed to the scene of the accident and was heard wailing in grief. 

A police officer was seen holding her back from her children's mangled car, which responding officers covered with a tarp while waiting for the coroner to arrive and remove the teenagers' bodies.

Elexis Garcia, known to her friends as Lexi, was a senior while her brother was a sophomore. 

By all accounts, the two siblings were inseparable, even jokingly calling themselves twins, reported The Daily Breeze.

Those who knew Elias described him as the most popular boy in school, known for his fashionable hip hop-inspired clothes and his bold nickname, ‘The King.’

‘He was the center of attention at all parties,’ said Christopher Ortega, a former Banning student. ‘Everybody liked him.’

Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino, who represents Wilmington, started a fund to help the Garcias’ family with the teens’ final expenses.
