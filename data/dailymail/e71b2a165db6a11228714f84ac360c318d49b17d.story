They are nicknamed the Rebel Dawgs and have spent their lives touring the US on a Harley Davidson.

But these easy riders are actually two Shih Tzus who were certainly born to be wild.

Biker Robert Reed carries his two faithful companions on his Harley Davidson for the thrills of the journey as he makes his way across America

Dressed up in mini jackets and goggles to protect their eyes, the adrenaline junkie Shih Tzus - nicknamed the Rebel Dawgs - have travelled across 22 states visiting places like Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone National Park.

Single Robert, 53 from Texas, has been taking Andy, 11, and Maddie, three, on his Harley ever since they were puppies.

Originally they travelled in his jacket, but now Andy sits on the tank and Maddie in a modified dog carrier behind Robert.

Robert, who rides a Harley Davidson Heritage Classic 2011, said: 'I feel so blessed to be able to travel with them.

'The two of them really seem to love riding as much as I do.

'I had to make a pad for Andy, but he must be comfortable as he curls up.

'He even takes naps on long trips.

Robert works two jobs to be able to afford his road trips and his and the dogs' Starbucks addiction while they're on their trips

The two dogs have visited iconic landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone National Park while on tour

The dogs aren't welcomed on every visit however - Robert had to cancel a trip to Ecuador as they wouldn't have been allowed to enter

'I added a roll cage to Maddie's dog carrier to make it safer for her.'

Robert works two jobs to be able to afford his road trips and his and the dogs' Starbucks addiction - Andy and Maddie enjoy their lemon pound cake.

In the summer, all three are planning a three-week-long trip to the Glacier National Park on the Canada-Montana border.

Robert said: 'I was going to go to Ecuador and this year but would have been unable to take the Rebel Dawgs with so I decided against it.

Originally the dogs travelled in Robert's jacket, but now Andy sits on the tank and Maddie in the carrier on the back of the bike

Andy, pictured here, is blind in one eye but still gets to see some spectacular sites in the US, while hitching a ride on some other unconventional modes of transport

Biker Robert says the best thing is seeing how many smiles the dogs get when they stop off on their journey

'Andy is getting older and almost blind in one eye and not sure how many more trips he may be able to make.

'The best part about riding with the two of them is seeing how many smiles they get at all our stops and by the people passing on the road.

'People pass us and slow down to come back and get their pictures.

'I'm sure there have been thousands of pics of them taken over the years. Lots of people's vacation pics include the Rebel Dawgs.'
