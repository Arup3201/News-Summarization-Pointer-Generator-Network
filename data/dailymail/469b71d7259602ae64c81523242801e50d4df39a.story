Jeff Gordon has attacked NASCAR's new bad boy in a pit lane brawl at Texas Motor Speedway after a little contact on the race track led to a whole lot of contact when the drivers got out of their cars.

Gordon, NASCAR's 'wonder boy,' was furious at Brad Keselowski for causing a crash at the end of Sunday's AAA Texas 500 that left Gordon finishing in 29th place.

By the end, Keselowski was left spitting blood and Gordon had a cut on his lip. 

'He's just a dips***, you know. I mean, the way he races it's a wonder he's ever won a championship,' Gordon told reporters after the fight.

Gordon was left with a cut on his lip after the brawl. The furious racer called Keselowski a 'dips***' and said he was dangerous on the track

This was Keselowski's second fight in four races and he remained unapologetic. 

'We were just racing for the win, I didn't wreck him, and just raced him hard. He left a hole. Everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you're supposed to go for it,' said Keselowski, who finished third.

'I don't want to ruin anyone's day. I wanted to win the race and that was the opportunity. It just didn't come together.'

Gordon was leading on a restart at the end of the race when he took the outside line. When Gordon's No 24 car drifted up a bit, Keselowski pushed through the gap and bumped Gordon.

The contact left Gordon with a flat tire and caused him to go spinning. 

'It's his disregard for what's going on out there. He made an over-aggressive move. Those are moves you find if you've got a slamming, banging race. He cut my left rear tire. That was it for me. It's a real shame,' 43-year-old Gordon fumed. 

Keselowski, 30, posted a picture of the gap that he pushed through and tweeted: 'We had fresher tires, With a win & the championship on the line.You either take the gap, or regret it forever...'

As soon as Gordon finished the race, he pulled up alongside Keselowski's No 2 car in pit lane, got out and ran over to his opponent to exchange words.

Things got physical when racer Kevin Harvick, who finished second in the race, ran up behind Keselowski and shoved him. 

Gordon then grabbed the racer's fire suit as crew members from all sides raced over the break up the fracas. 

Jimmie Johnson, who has already been eliminated from the NASCAR Chase for the Sprint Cup championship series, won the race on Sunday night.

Both Gordon and Keselowski has been challenging for the spot in the championship series and a win on Sunday night would have guaranteed them a place.
