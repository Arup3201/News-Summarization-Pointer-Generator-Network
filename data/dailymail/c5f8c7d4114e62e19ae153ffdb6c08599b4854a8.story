More than a quarter of home buyers are now paying stamp duty at the higher rates of 3 per cent or more, research has found.

Hundreds of thousands of first-time buyers and hardworking families are losing out to the tune of more than £7,500 when they move home, the TaxPayers’ Alliance study found.

The pressure group launched a Stamp Out Stamp Duty campaign calling for a cut in the ‘punitive’ levy, which raised £4billion for the Treasury in 2012/13 - some £3.6billion of which was collected at rates of 3 per cent or more.

They say it is unfair that rising house prices mean that a greater proportion of homes are coming into the net of the higher levies because the thresholds have stayed static for years.

Sales of residential properties are free of stamp duty up to the value of £125,000 and attract a 1 per cent tax between £125,000 and £250,000.

But rising house prices mean that more and more purchasers are paying at the higher rates of 3 per cent applied to homes worth between £250,000 and £500,000.

A rate of 4 per cent is charged on those valued at up to £1million, 5 per cent on those between £1-£2million and 7 per cent beyond that point.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Owning your own home is an important milestone, but for many families it seems harder and harder to reach. 

Sales of residential properties are free of stamp duty up to the value of £125,000 and attract a 1 per cent tax between £125,000 and £250,000

‘Ministers have done nothing to ease the burden imposed by stamp duty, which is an unfair double tax that gets in the way of would-be first-time buyers and others thinking about moving. Instead they have made things worse with new thresholds and new, higher rates.

‘The Government needs to act on ministers’ rhetoric about getting people onto the property ladder and cut this unfair tax.’ 

The TaxPayers’ Alliance research found that, unsurprisingly, home-buyers in London and the South East are hardest hit. But an increasing number of people in other parts of the country are being hit by stamp duty at the 3 per cent rate.

The group argues that stamp duty acts as a barrier both for an increasing number of first-time buyers and existing home-owners wanting to move house to get a new job, be near to relatives or accommodate a growing family.

Because stamp duty is imposed on the total value of the property, and not just the portion of the price which is above the threshold, families buying a home for between £250,000 and £500,000 pay between £7,500 and £15,000.

Tax bills: The average house price has sat above the 1 per cent stamp duty threshold for a decade, Nationwide's chart shows, but many properties incur a much higher 3 per cent charge.

In England and Wales, some 723,829 homes were bought in 2012/13, with more than 25 per cent (182,692) being liable for stamp duty at a rate of 3 per cent or more.

Stamp duty rates of 3 per cent or more were imposed on 65 per cent of all residential transactions in London, and 39 per cent in the rest of the South-East.

The figure was 27 per cent in the East of England, 24 per cent in the South-West, 12 per cent in the West Midlands and 10 per cent in the East Midlands, according to the TPA research.

In the north, the figures were much lower: 9 per cent in the North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber, and 6 per cent in the North-East.

Some 8 per cent of Welsh homes attracted the higher levies. The TPA did not look at Scotland.

The recent 2020 Tax Commission review by the TPA and the Institute of Directors concluded that stamp duty should be abolished, as did the Mirrlees Review from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

Simon Lambert: Stamp duty is an unfair tax that needs changing

Perhaps the most infuriating thing about the unfair stamp duty system is that today's buyers of an ordinary family home get stung with a tax bill originally designed for the wealthiest, writes This is Money editor Simon Lambert.

That £250,000 threshold that hits ordinary families so hard has never gone up, despite rampant house price inflation since 1997, when then Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced extra levels of the tax.

If it had been linked to property prices it would now stand at £716,000, according to Nationwide's data.

As a point of comparison, today's £250,000 home would have cost you £87,000 in 1997 - a level that would currently incur no stamp duty whatsoever.

Buyers pay the tax on a property's sale price, so those big bills they pay are ultimately driven by the seller's profit. You can work out how much stamp duty you would pay using our calculator below.

Until Gordon Brown's arrival as Chancellor in 1997, stamp duty was a flat rate of 1% above £60,000.

He first changed this to 1.5% above £250,000 and 2% above £500,000 and then cashed in on his property boom by hiking these to 3% and 4%, respectively, in 2000.

The effect as house prices rocketed through the 2000s boom was a nice little earner as the tax dragged more and more families into a trap originally laid for the wealthy.

Since then new stamp duty thresholds have also been added at £1m and £2m and George Osborne has given no indication that he will change the slab system, despite repeated calls to do so.

This is Money has long campaigned against the unfair nature of stamp duty and called for a serious investigation into its change and welcomes the Stamp Out Stamp Duty campaign. It is a bad tax, it is levelled unfairly, hits some regions far worse than others, encourages extra debt and inhibits people moving for work.

While a change to stamp duty would cut tax revenue, it would at least make the system fairer. It would also prevent the current situation that involves buyers loading themselves up with bigger mortgages as they need to use cash that could have gone into their deposit to pay a hefty tax bill.

From midnight on 21 March, Budget Day 2012, a new tax tier was introduced on homes costing more than £2,000,000. These homes now attract a rate of 7%.
