A top independent school in Scotland is offering parents a mortgage-style payment scheme for their child's school fees.

In a move to make private education more affordable, the Fernhill School in Glasgow has offered parents the chance to spread the cost of fees over ten years, interest free.

Tony Boswell, a governor of the Catholic school, which charges £8976 a year for a senior school day pupil, said the new payment plan, thought to be the first of its kind in Scotland, could reduce monthly payments by up to 50 per cent.

'Innovative': Under the Fernhill scheme, parents can pay half the school fees every year and repay the outstanding amount after their child has left

He said: ‘We recognise that times are tough and we have been striving to develop a solution that helps families who may otherwise be unable to afford an independent education.

‘Fernhill's payment plan will be launched for the 2013/14 school year and allow parents whose children are joining this year to spread the cost of their fees over a longer term.

‘There is high demand from prospective parents for this kind of payment plan and, as this recession lengthens, we believe it is the right thing to do to ease the financial burden on those who want a private education.’

The average cost of private education is now more than £12,000 a year, with fees rising faster than the rate of inflation.

Money troubles: The increase in school fees has put pressure on parents

The price of sending a child to an independent school in Scotland rose by 3.5 per cent in 2012/13 - with the highest fees topping £21,000.

The increases put pressure on parents - particularly those for whom private education is at the limits of affordability.

In February, the consumer price index, the Government's preferred measure of inflation, was running at 2.7 per cent, while the retail price index rose to 3.3 per cent in January.

A report by the Bank of Scotland - published before the impact of the credit crunch - warned that members of key Scottish professions were already being priced out of sending their children to fee-paying schools, with teachers, engineers and police officers no longer able to afford a private education.

More recently, the number of children attending private school in Scotland has fallen, with a drop of 1.5 per cent in both nursery and primary between 2010/11 and 2011/12.

Under the Fernhill scheme, parents can pay half the school fees every year rather than the full amount and continue to repay the outstanding sums once their child has left.

Other financial schemes available to parents in the sector include savings plans where money can be built up in advance of paying fees.

In England, a number of finance companies offer to pay the fees in advance with parents repaying over a longer period time plus additional interest.

A spokeswoman for the Scottish Council for Independent Schools described the scheme as ‘innovative’.

She said: ‘Schools will be looking different ways to help parents and this is an innovative scheme that will help families mane the cost of a private education.'
