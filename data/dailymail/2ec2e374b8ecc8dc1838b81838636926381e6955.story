A man who climbed a bicycle
rack outside the White House fence on Sunday has been charged
with unlawful entry, the U.S. Secret Service said.

Agency spokesman Brian Leary said the suspect did not make
it over the bike rack, which is set back from the presidential
residence's fence on Pennsylvania Avenue.

The Secret Service, which protects the president and other
U.S. leaders, has come under scrutiny after a series of security
lapses.

A man who climbed a bicyclerack outside the White House fence on Sunday has been chargedwith unlawful entry, the U.S. Secret Service said

Last Monday, a small drone operated by an employee of a U.S.
spy agency crashed on the White House grounds.

In September, an
intruder jumped the White House fence and got into the building
before being apprehended.

ABC News notes that in the case of the drone, the device's owner has blamed the incident on the manufacturer.

The Secret Service is still investigating the incident. 

However the repeated issues have raised questions about the quality of White House security.

Shortly after the September incident, Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned when a White House fence jumper got into the house via the North Portico. 

The intrude was finally tackled by agents in the East Room.

Also that September it was found that Obama was in an elevator with an armed security contractor with a criminal history, who was only flagged after he took photos and acted unprofessionally in the elevator.
