A 21-year-old man allegedly kicked in the head by two men outside a McDonald's outlet in Melbourne died an hour later from his injuries in hospital.

Police are yet to formally identify the victim but say they have clear CCTV footage of his two alleged attackers, who fled after the unprovoked assault at about 1.10am on Saturday.

Homicide squad Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon said the victim was standing outside the McDonald's store on St Kilda Road when a fight allegedly started between the victim and two other men aged in their 20s, who had just bought some food.

'He was grabbed by the arm and violently thrown to the ground head first, and then kicked to the head,' Det Serg Solomon said.

'He lapsed into unconsciousness immediately.'

Both men were allegedly involved in the assault, which appeared to be unprovoked, Det Serg Solomon said.

After the attack, the two men headed south along St Kilda Road.

The victim was taken by ambulance to the Alfred Hospital with critical injuries but died an hour later.

A police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that the 21-year-old man was from Parkville - north of Melbourne.

'It's yet another violent, senseless assault occurring on a public street in Melbourne late at night,' Det Serg Solomon said.

Police say the victim was well dressed in a black suit and shirt, but was not carrying any identification.

There was no indication that he knew his attackers.

'There appears to have been a discussion leading up to the assault. We're not aware what words were exchanged,' Det Solomon said.

Customers in the McDonald's outlet went to the victim's aid.
