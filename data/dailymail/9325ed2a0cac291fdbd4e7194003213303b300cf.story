Hard-left union leader Len McCluskey has praised Ed Miliband as Labour’s best leader since Michael Foot.

The Unite chief used a speech to hail him as the most radical leader since 1983, the year of Labour’s ‘longest suicide note in history’ manifesto and worst election result since the War.

And he gloated over the fact that under Mr Miliband, New Labour and the centre-left policies pioneered by triple election-winning Tony Blair had been abandoned.

The trenchant speech will raise fears over Mr McCluskey’s influence over the Labour leader, dubbed Red Ed by critics. Unite is one of the largest trade unions, and the unions are responsible for three quarters of Labour’s funding.

Mr McCluskey gave the lecture in memory of Jimmy Reid, a left-wing activist who led a group of dockers who took over shipyards on the Clyde in 1971.

He praised Ed Miliband’s speech to last month’s Labour conference, when he promised 1970s-style price controls for energy bills and suggested developers who refuse to build on their land should see it confiscated by the state.

‘We should ask if the glass is filling up or draining way,’ he said. ‘Put like that, the answer cannot really be in doubt.

‘Ed Miliband’s speech to the Labour conference was – some would say – the most genuinely radical we have heard from a Labour leader for nigh on 30 years.’

Thirty years ago, Michael Foot led his party to a historic defeat, losing three million votes since the 1979 election.

His successor, Neil Kinnock, started the slow process of moving Labour towards the centre ground and making it more electable.

Mr McCluskey went on: ‘To say that the next Labour government will not let the energy monopolies carry on ripping us off, to say that the property speculators will no longer be able to stop our kids getting a decent roof over their heads, and to tell the biggest companies that they are going to have to pay more tax – that is not just a break with the Coalition’s policies, it also represents Labour turning its back on the neo-liberal dogmas which dominated the Blair-Brown years.

‘So I unequivocally welcome Ed’s speech. Allied to his brave stance over Syria – a stance which flew in the face of the unsolicited advice of Tony Blair and which I believe has saved lived by stopping a global rush to war – there is no doubt that this is no longer “New Labour” as we knew it.’

Mr McCluskey said, however, that the ‘critical question’ – more important than any social policies Labour might introduce – was what the party was planning to do about ‘trade union freedom’.

‘I do not say that just because I’m a trade union leader, but because I believe that social progress is maybe 25 per cent the work of government, and 75 per cent the job of working-class self-organisation,’ he said.

The Unite general secretary said calls to break the link between Labour and the unions was a ‘right-wing agenda’, saying: ‘That’s what lies behind the incessant attacks on our political work by the Tories and the media, and the unfortunate echo those attacks sometimes find within the Labour party itself.’

In a menacing section of his speech, he suggested that the working classes should ‘take over’ society.

He said: ‘Jimmy Reid believed that a better society could be achieved if people were willing to fight for it. It is a belief I have always shared.

‘Jimmy said – at the time of the UCS work-in – “We are taking over the yards because we refuse to accept that faceless men can make these decisions”.

‘Substitute the word “society” for “the yards” and we have an outlook as relevant today as it was then.’

Last night a Tory source said: ‘The union barons have given 75 per cent of Labour’s cash under Ed Miliband.

‘They oppose cutting the deficit, they oppose fixing the welfare system and they oppose every difficult decision we’ve taken to fix our economy. With the union barons in charge, Labour haven’t changed. It’s the same old Labour.’
