A heartbroken daughter has revealed how her elderly parents' implication in four gruesome murders 40 years ago has turned her idyllic, rural life upside down and shattered her childhood memories. 

Erica Hayes, the youngest daughter of Gerald Uden, 71, and 74-year-old Alice
 Louise Uden, admitted that although her mother and step-father had done terrible things 'they're still the people I love'. 

Gerald Uden, from Chadwick, Missouri, was sentenced to life in prison in November after he confessed to the 1980 shootings of his ex-wife and her two sons, aged 10 and 11.

Alice Louise 
Uden has pleaded not guilty to the murder of her third husband Ronald Holtz, 25, whose body was recently found in an abandoned Wyoming mine.

Gerald Uden has been sentenced to life for murdering his first wife and her two sons.  Alice Louise Uden is awaiting trial for the first-degree murder of her third husband and has pleaded not guilty

The couple hid the 
bodies in Wyoming decades ago - then married each other and moved 
1,100 miles away to the tiny community of Chadwick, Missouri.

Ms Hayes describes her childhood in the rural farming town as idyllic saying that her parents were very happily married and 'always laughing'.

That peaceful world was obliterated on
 September 26 last year when Mrs Uden, a trained nurse, was arrested for
 the murder of Holtz.

Someone had led police in 2007 to the mine where he was buried after he was last seen in December 1974 in Sheridan, Wyoming.

Mr Uden, a long-distance truck driver, was arrested a day later for the murders of his ex-wife and her two boys.

Their
 daughter Erica Hayes, a 41-year-old truck driver, described the moment 
that her stepfather found out that his lifelong lie was finally over.

Uden took Erica's son Mackenzie, 20, into the bedroom and gave him his hunting rifles and guitars.

Ms Hayes told People: 'He [Uden] then heard the knock at the door and he said, ''Mackenzie, don't be scared, but this is it.''

Erica Hayes, daughter of Alice and Gerald Uden, spoke to People magazine about her killer parents

'It was the FBI. I gave him a hug. And he said, ''God I am sorry for what I did.'''

In September 1980, the wife of Gerald Uden disappeared from Lander, Wyoming, along with her two sons, Reagan aged 10, and 11-year-old Richard. Uden had adopted the two boys during his short marriage to Virginia but was not the biological father.

Mrs Uden, 32, and her sons were last seen at her mother Claire Martin's house before setting off to meet Gerald Uden and go hunting.

A few days later, Virginia's car was found vandalized and soaked with blood. It had been covered in pine boughs in an attempt to hide it.

Sadly, Gerald Uden's confessions did not 
come in time for Mrs Martin who died last April at the age of 92 without
 ever knowing what happened to her only daughter and grandsons. 

According to People, Mrs Martin felt certain that Gerald Uden was to blame but had no proof.

Ms Hayes told the magazine that she already knew her mother's dark secret after Alice Louise Uden confessed to her in 2004 that she had killed someone.

Ms Hayes told People: 'She sat me down and said she had killed someone...She said Holtz was abusive and threatened to kill both of us and that she did it to protect me.

'She started crying and then wrapped me up in her arms and told me ''Whatever happens, happens.'''

Ms Hayes said that the dark secrets have blown her world apart but that despite what she now knows about her parents' pasts, 'they're still the people I love'.

Virginia Uden was murdered by her husband Gerald so that he could be with Alice Louise

Alice Uden's long-held secret appears to have come to light after someone reportedly told police in 1989 that she had confessed to shooting her husband in his sleep.

The same source in 2007 then reportedly took police to a mining shaft.

Authorities say they recovered Ronald Holtz's body in a mine on a ranch 
in Laramie County in southeast Wyoming last summer. Investigators say a 
bullet hole was in his skull.

Gerald Uden confessed that Virginia Uden and the two boys were in drums at the bottom of Freemont Lake.

He was sentenced on November 1 to life in prison. Uden was vague about his motive but said Virginia Uden had become 'intolerable'.

'Virginia did her very best to split Alice and me apart,' he said. 'She used the boys to do that.'

He said he had no excuse for the murders - and Fremont County District Judge Norman Young said he agreed.

Gerald Uden married Virginia Uden in 1974.

'She came to me in false pretenses,' Uden told the courtroom in November. 'She came to me looking for a husband, and through circumstances, I fell in love with this woman, and we married.'

He said Virginia asked him to adopt her children. He did but she filed for divorce six weeks later.

Gerald then married Alice. While some investigators have thought that child support was his motive, Uden said paying child support was not a problem.

He said he finally ended up 'having to make a choice' between Alice and Virginia.

He said on the day of the slayings, he met Virginia and the boys at a corner near his home east of Pavillion. He said Virginia brought along a .22-caliber rifle, but he denied asking her to bring it.

He said they drove 5 or 6 miles north in a 1973 Ford Country Squire station wagon, then got out near an irrigation canal.

'The boys wanted to shoot the rifle,' Uden said. 'I said I wanted to test it. I tested it; it worked just fine.'

He said he walked up behind Virginia Uden, shot her in the back of the head, then shot Richard behind the ear.

'Reagan saw what was happening. He ran, tripped and fell in the ditch,' Uden said. 'When he did, I walked up and shot him behind the ear.'

Authorities later found the station wagon with blood in it, but no sign of the victims.

Uden said he disposed of the bodies in an old mine but went back a couple months later and retrieved them.

He put Virginia's body in a 55-gallon steel drum and sealed it, he said, then put the boys' bodies in a 30-gallon drum and sealed it, too. He said he took his boat to Fremont Lake and dumped the drums.

The bodies have not yet been found.
