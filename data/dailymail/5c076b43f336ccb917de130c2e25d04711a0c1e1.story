A white Muslim convert threatened to kill Prince Harry just a day after the shocking murder of a soldier in Woolwich.

Ashraf Islam, 30, formerly known as Mark Townley, confessed to police that he wanted to kill the third in line to the throne, who has served in high profile tours of Afghanistan.

Islam walked into a police station in Hounslow on May 23 and told detectives that he wanted to murder the prince hours after soldier Lee Rigby, 25, was killed.

He was charged under Section 16 of the Offences against the Person Act, which carries a possible jail term of up to 10 years, following an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's Counter terrorism Command unit.

According to the Daily Star detectives found a laptop belonging to Islam which showed internet searches for 'guns', 'vans' and 'kidnapping'.

He is also said to have visited terrorist websites.

Islam, who is believed to have become a Muslim during a recent spell in prison, is currently behind bars after pleading guilty to the offence at Uxbridge Magistrates Court last Saturday.

Murdered: Drummer Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich on May 22

He will be sentenced at a later date.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said last night that no date has been fixed for Islam's sentencing.

A review of Prince Harry's security was launched in the wake of Drummer Rigby's murder, according to the Sunday Mirror.

It is feared that Harry, 28, might be a prime target for the Taliban after touring Afghanistan twice with the Household Cavalry in 2008 and the Army Air Corps last year.

The Taliban said while the Prince was at Camp bastion last year that they were doing everything in their power 'to get rid of him'.

His comments in an interview that revealed that he had killed Taliban insurgents while on active duty are likely to have made him even more of a target.

He is also a high profile supporter of military causes including the Help for Heroes charity - he opened a Help for Heroes funded facility for injured service personnel with Prince William days before Drummer Rigby's murder.

Drummer Rigby was reportedly wearing one of the charity's T shirts when he was killed.

A royal source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Prince Harry's security is constantly reviewed and has been massively stepped up in the last 10 days.

'This case and the horrific case of Lee Rigby show that there is constant danger.

'Harry's security team cannot be complacent.'

The prince is said to have been given extra SAS protection.

Target: Harry is thought to be a high profile Taliban target because of his service in Afghanistan and an interview he gave where he said he had killed Taliban insurgents in active duty

According to the Star, Northern Ireland Islam was given a suspended jail term and banned from England and Wales for two years under his former name Mark Townley for conning ex-soldiers.

He is said to have become 'ingratiated' with a Muslim group in 2010 and faced fraud and theft charges after he returned to Northern ireland after a spell in the Middle East.

He is said to have changed his name around the same time as he served a prison sentence in 2011.

Islam reportedly worked in the adult film industry and told a newspaper that he was a 'part time' Muslim.

He is believed to be in custody at Wormwood Scrubs prison in London.Â
