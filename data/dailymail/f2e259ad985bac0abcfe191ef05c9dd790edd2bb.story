A 77-year-old dementia patient has spent nearly a week languishing in prison after allegedly stabbing a woman at her senior care facility with a comb.

Police arrested Martha Glover at California's Solano Life House, a home for dementia patients, following reports the grandmother stabbed an elderly woman in the face and head nearly a week ago.

While she has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon, her family says she shouldn't have been arrested in the first place because of her illness.

Tragic: Dementia patient Martha Glover, 77, has spent nearly a week in prison after allegedly stabbing an elderly woman at her care facility

Dementia is a chronic disorder characterized by memory loss, disorientation and inability to follow directions.

Glover's daughter Lenore Dangerfield told CBS the care facility was responsible for her mother and she should not have been arrested.

'She doesn’t drive. She doesn’t take 
care of any of her own affairs. She can’t hold a lucid conversation,' she said.

Dangerfield said police were aware of 
Glover’s violent outbursts because they say they had been to the 
facility before.

Civil rights attorney Jeff Kravitz says the care facility in charge failed the suspect - who has spent six days in jail - and the victim.

'I don’t think the police ultimately had much choice about making the initial arrest,' he told CBS.

'Indeed the police have the right to 
detain people who have serious psychological problems if they are a 
danger to themselves or others.

'They [the nursing home] knew of the 
condition of the attacker - for lack of a better word. They have a duty 
and responsibility to protect her, even against her own actions.'

CBS said the facility did not return calls.
