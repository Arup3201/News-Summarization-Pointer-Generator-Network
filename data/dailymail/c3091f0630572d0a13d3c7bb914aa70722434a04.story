An internet blackout has hit Syria, leaving the war-torn country without online access for almost seven hours.

The outage - which lasted from 12.30pm to 7pm yesterday - was blamed on a 'breakdown in the optical fibre cable' in Damascus countryside, according to the state-owned Syrian Arab News Agency.

Only one online link remained during the outage - via TurkTelecom connecting Aleppo, a city which has seen intense fighting during the civil war that began in 2011 and has left 100,000 dead.

The outage was reported by internet monitoring firm Renesys and cybersecurity company Akamai.

Doug Madory, a researcher at Renesys, told The Washington Post: ‘Unfortunately, (the) internet outage in Syria is just the latest communications blackout in the country's long-running civil war.

‘The link to Turkey, established last summer, appears intact, which is consistent with outages over the past few months. Aleppo's outages occur independently from the country-wide blackouts.’

A hacktivist group called the European Cyber Army yesterday claimed responsibility on Twitter for the blackout, saying it was in retaliation for attacks by the Syrian Electronic Army on Western systems.

‘As you may or may not have noticed, Syria was wiped off the face of the internet,’ the group said yesterday. ‘SEA is a grave threat... A threat that must be neutralised before it spreads like a disease.’

The SEA is an amorphous hacking collective that supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and has previously attacked the likes of media outlets the Associated Press, ITV News and Reuters.

It was not clear today whether the ECA or the fibre-optic cable breakdown caused the blackout.

Mr Madory, of New Hampshire-based Renesys, said there have been more than 10 internet outages in Syria over the past year - and the latest one was ‘probably the longest since May of last year’.

He told IT magazine Computerworld: ‘Cuba is considered severe as well. It goes through one provider to the outside world. Syria has two connections to the outside world.’
