New footage has revealed the bizarre art of taming horses using yoga and even doing handstands on them.

The exercise of horse yoga is practiced at the Doma India School in San Luis, Argentina with the aim of taming and relaxing wild, traumatised and nervous horses.

The school was founded by father and son Oscar and Cristobal Scarpati and they live on a farm in the South American country.Â

According to their website, the family work under the philosophy that non-violent forms of horse taming can develop a bond between man and horse.

And as the pictures show this technique includes laying the horses on their back while handstands are performed on them.

The Doma India School's website states: 'In contrast with most known methods, taming is established body-to-body in a natural game similar to that used in a herd of horses.

The school say that their yoga technique helps to tame the horses and makes them calm

'Acts that are widely considered dangerous (due to the intense physical contact between horse and tamer) become safety techniques and methods by which the horses quickly lose the fear (spooking/sensibility) which renders them so unpredictable.

'The removal of fear (spooking/sensibility) using the Scarpati method guarantees a loyal relationship with an untamed horse.'

The website also claims the family have helped horses throughout South America and Europe and say their technique tames the animals by earning their trust and loyalty.
