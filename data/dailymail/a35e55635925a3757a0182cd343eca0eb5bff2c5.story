A neighbour from hell kept people awake up to a mile away because of the 100 birds he had cooped up in his back garden, a court heard.

Michael Hall, 53, caused problems in his suburban cul-de-sac and beyond for six years with his noisy flock of ducks, chickens, guinea fowl and pheasants.

Residents complained Hall's huge collection of birds stopped them sleeping because of their constant clucking, crowing and quacking.

They also said they attracted pests such as foxes and flies because they lived in squalid conditions.

Noisy neighbour: Michael Hall kept at least 100 birds in his garden and locals were so upset about six years of noise they took him to court

Upsetting: The birds were kept in filthy conditions that has led to a total ban for Michael Hall

Disturbance: The constant noise from birds such as these chickens forced neighbours to take legal actions as Hall just ignored them

Argument: Neighbours built a case against Hall and said the birds kept them awake at night and their filth attracted foxes and flies and polluted the air with their foul-smelling droppings

At the height of the disruption even people living in nearby streets a mile away were knocking on the door of Hall's £190,000 detached 
house in Nottingham to complain about the noise.

After pleading with him to get rid of the birds his fed-up neighbours' pleas fell on deaf ears and they launched legal action against Hall.

They amassed a catalogue of evidence against him, including photos and videos of his back garden and even audio recordings of cockerels crowing.

And locals were celebrating today after magistrates prohibited Hall - who had already cleared the enclosure - from keeping animals in future.

Hall denied causing a statutory nuisance under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act but was fined £100 and ordered to pay legal costs of £437.60 and a victim surcharge of £20.

Nottingham Magistrates Court heard how residents in Borman Close suffered frequent rat infestations after the pests were attracted by cast-off bird food.

Witnesses also told the court their sleep would be interrupted by the noise of panicked ducks whenever a fox squeezed through hall's garden fence.

Happy day: (R-L) Laura Sheridan and Julie Robinson are among the neighbours who have had to put up with 6 years of nuisance from neighbour Michael Hall

Sweet relief: Laura Sheridan, 29, represented herself and the rest of her neighbours in court, and can now have her windows open again

Laura Sheridan, 29, who represented herself and the rest of her neighbours in court, presented evidence against Hall at the one-day hearing.

After the case Mrs Sheridan hailed the verdict as a victory for her street after years of 'sleepless nights'.

Yesterday, she said: 'We are absolutely thrilled at the outcome.

'We just wanted the magistrates to agree with us so we could get our gardens back, sleep and sanity, and enjoy our lives.'

Moving forward: The garden that was once filled with birds and filth has now been cleared

Julie Robinson, 44, another resident who was in court, described the constant battle to curb the problem of the birds.

She said: 'It started about six years ago with a dog and then just escalated from there.

'I've lost count of the number of times we approached him - you'd have a perfectly amicable conversation and he said he'd sort it out - but nothing ever came of it.

'He must have been oblivious to the noise and the smells but they were very obvious to everyone else.

'Despite threatening him with legal action it never seemed to spur him into cleaning the place up.

'We were extremely pleased with the court's decision but it's a shame it had to come to this.

'We used to have a nice, neighbourly relationship but that's sadly not the case now.'

Reacting to the verdict, Hall said he was disappointed by the magistrates' decision.

He said: 'I feel like a goldfish in a bowl. I go home. I'm watched. I'm recorded.'
