An unnamed police officer from St. Ann, Missouri, has been relieved of duty and suspended indefinitely after he was caught on camera pointing an assault rifle at a protester, in Ferguson, on Tuesday night.

The officer was supposed to part of the effort to keep the peace, but instead two separate videos uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday show him pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle at protestors and shouting: ‘I will f****** kill you.’

The incident happened just before midnight on Tuesday during the latest of several protests that have followed the August 9 shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer.

On the video, a man is heard saying, 'Oh my God! Gun raised!' as the officer approaches. The identity of the man who shot the video is not known.

'My hands are up, bro! My hands are up!' the man said.

The officer walks near the man with his gun pointed and appears to say, 'I will f****** kill you.' 

Another protestor then asks the officer to identify himself.

'What's your name, sir?' he asks.

'Go f*** yourself,' the officer replies.

In another video, protestors can be heard shouting at the officer to lower his weapon.

St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said a county police sergeant took immediate action, telling the officer to lower the weapon and escorting him from the area. 

The officer was suspended indefinitely on Wednesday afternoon. 

'A St. Ann Police Officer pointed a semi-automatic assault rifle at a peaceful protestor after a verbal exchange. 

'It was at this time a St. Louis County Police Sergeant walked over and immediately took action, forcing the officer to lower the weapon, and escorting him away from the area,' said a statement from the county police department.

‘The unified command strongly feel these actions are inappropriate, and not indicative of the officers who have worked daily, to keep the peace.'
