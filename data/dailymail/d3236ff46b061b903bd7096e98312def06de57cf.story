Overindulging is something we are all guilty of at Christmas. 

But did you know there are around 6,000 calories lurking in the average Christmas Day feast, putting us at risk of gaining almost half a stone by the New Year.

From potatoes roasted in goose fat to celebratory glasses of champagne, it is easy to pack in almost three times your recommended daily allowance in one sitting.

And dietitian Helen Bond warns just a few canapes before dinner can add 2,000 calories - equal to a woman's daily recommended allowance - to the festive feast tally.

While the temptation can be too much for many, this infographic, produced by Lloyds Pharmacy Online Doctor, offers a host of top tips to surviving the festive period - your waistline unscathed.

With the average person consuming a staggering 6,000 calories on Christmas Day, there are a host of tips to help you prepare a lighter festive feast that is kinder to your waistline

From removing the skin of the turkey, to cutting potatoes slightly bigger, and opting for a dark chocolate, it is possible to enjoy a lighter Christmas without missing out.

Mrs Bond told MailOnline: 'The average Christmas dinner has 6,000 calories. 

'When you consider a woman's daily recommended allowance is 2,000 and a man's is 2,500, that equates to almost three times your daily amounts.

'The more vegetables on your plate, the less room there is for fatty foods, and they can help fill you up for longer.'

Meanwhile Lloyds Pharmacy  GP, Dr Minal Bakhai, warned the festive period can be particularly hazardous for those with health condition, including diabetes and high cholesterol and blood pressure.

Moderation, they  agree, is key with portion control at the very heart of a healthier Christmas.

THE HIDDEN CALORIES IN CANAPES 

And the worst offenders on the Christmas party menu? Canapes, said Mrs Bond.

Sausage rolls, pigs in blankets, mini tartlets packed with tasty fillings - just a handful of bite-sized appetisers before Christmas dinner can add a staggering 2,000 calories to your festive tally. 

'They are so moreish, and we know when our taste buds are overstimulated we are more likely to over indulge,' she said.

'And often they are eaten before a main meal, meaning you could consume your recommended daily allowance of calories before Christmas dinner.

'That is why it is so important to have a really good breakfast, or if you are off to a party a good bowl of soup or cereal to fill you up.' 

'It is all about moderation. In the past Christmas used to be about one day, then you had Boxing Day.

'But now it is an entire festive period, it is almost a four-week run up beforehand.

'A handful of crisps, a glass or two of champagne and it is easy to add 500 calories without realising.

'It is easy when you go to so many parties.

'The key is not to totally abandon your healthy eating principles. There are a number of clever swaps you can make to make a big difference.'

EASY SWAPS TO KEEP THE POUNDS OFF 

Choosing marinated chicken instead of breaded or deep fried, a handful of Twiglets rather than crisps and rationing the number of nuts you gorge on, can  all help.

White turkey meat has lower levels of fat than dark meat, and banishing the skin can cut calories. 

And when it comes to roast potatoes, cutting each serving slightly larger than normal helps to decrease the surface area absorbing the fat, helping to shave yet more calories from the festive feast.  

'They may be small changes, just 50 calories here and there, but they all add up,' Mrs Bond added.

'Five hundred extra calories a day puts on around 1lb a week, which by the end of the festive period could see a person gaining almost half a stone.'

BEAT THE BLOAT 

And if, like thousands of people you suffer irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you might have the perfect excuse to avoid the dreaded Brussels sprouts.

While full fibre, vitamin C and carotenoids, which boost eye health, they are also packed with raffinose.

Raffinose cannot be broken down by the stomach and bypasses the small intestines, travelling straight to the large intestine and colon where bacteria 'have a field day', producing methane gases and triggering bloating.

And on top of all that food, Mrs Bond said it is vital to remember the calories you will drink each day, toasting the occasion.

Dietitian Helen Bond warned Brussels sprouts contain high levels of raffinose, which cannot be digested by the stomach and so can cause bloating

'Alcohol is so calorific, a glass of champagne is around 89 calories,' she said. 'And often people top up their glasses without realising how many they are having.

'And once you have had one glass too many, you lose your inhibitions and are more likely to overeat.

'Maybe choose a smaller glass of wine, drink it from a champagne flute, to cut down.'

'That is not to say you have to be party poopers on Christmas Day,' she added.

'But for many by New Year they can gain as much as 5lbs, which is so much harder to lose than it is to gain.  

'Opt for a fruit or veggie stuffing over sausage meat, and skimmed or one per cent milk to make bread sauce, rather than cream or whole milk.

'And be aware of your butter intake, at Christmas it is all about brandy butter. But a teapsoon of butter, around 5g, can pack in as many as 45 calories.

'Instead, maybe use lemon juice and if you are craving a mince pie, choose a smaller one.

COUNT YOUR CHOCOLATE WRAPPERS TO AVOID TEMPTATION

'Another popular treat is Christmas chocolates, tubs of Celebrations and Roses adorning tables.

'My tip is to keep hold of your wrappers to track how many you are eating, it is easy to dismiss them because they are small.' 

As well as clever food swaps, portion control and a little restraint, exercise can help you beat the January weight gain blues. 

'Christmas is a time where many people sit down with their families,' she said. 'All exercise habits can go out the window.

'But a brisk walk on Christmas Day can counteract some of the indulgence.'

'It all comes down to portion control,' she said. 'Restraint and balancing your food for a more comfortable, less bloated Christmas and an easier New Year.

'One in five people suffer IBS and Christmas often triggers the symptoms, especially with the stressful build-up beforehand.

'Overeating can leave a person feeling bloated and uncomfortable, so it is better to exercise a little restraint and opt for smaller portions of everything, without depriving yourself.

'Treat it like a normal day, enjoy it but don't over do it.' 

Dr Bakhai echoed the calls for restraint, highlighting the importance for those with existing health conditions.

She told MailOnline: 'It is particularly important for people with health conditions, such as high cholesterol and diabetes, to take care over the Christmas period.

'It is important to recognise you are eating a larger than normal meal, full of sugar, fat and carbohydrates, and so sugar levels in particular, may be affected.

'But it is not just one meal, it is the Christmas period.

'For type 1 diabetics they might need to be aware their insulin requirements are likely to go up over the festive period.

'It is about achieving a balance. A simple rule to follow is to fill half your plate with vegetables, a quarter with carbohydrates and the last quarter with lean meat.

'Enjoy it but remember it is not a normal meal, you are going to be indulging a lot more than usual.

'Consider that and eat in moderation and try to balance your meals as much as possible.' 

Choosing vegetable oil instead of goose fat, watching salt levels and enjoying a hearty breakfast can help
