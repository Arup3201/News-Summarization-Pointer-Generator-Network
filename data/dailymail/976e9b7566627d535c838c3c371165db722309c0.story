A young make-up artist continues to amaze the art world with her incredible miniature masterpieces - painted onto her eyelid.

Using just make-up tools such as liquid eyeliner and eyeshadow, plus tiny appliqu√© particles, Israeli make-up professional and blogger Tal Peleg imagines scenes from fairy tales, classic novels and emotions onto her face.

Her project, dubbed window to the soul, and previously covered by MailOnline has now taken she a deeper and more thought-provoking turn with pieces such as an anti-Bullying image pictured below.

Tal's Anti-Bullying design, 'words can be dangerous, use them wisely'

Inspired by Nils Holgersson, or the Wonderful Adventures of Nils, a Swedish children's book (l) Tal's Little Mermaid is part of her fairytale series, based on her own interpretation of the characters (r)

The young artist is using her new-found fame to explore important social issues, and has paired her emotive design with the slogan, 'words can be dangerous, use them wisely.

She also reveals the products she uses on her Facebook page.

Eyeshadows include: NYX Cosmetics black, Urban Decay Cosmetics unhinged, The Official Glamourdolleyes fiji mermaid, Mac kid. Eyeliner Gel: Ofra cosmetics, mascara: Eyeko skinny mascara and Black aquacolor by Paradise.

The 'blades' depicted in the first, anti-bullying image meanwhile are made from aluminium foil.

This image is inspired by Tal's favourite poet Edgar Allan Poe. She read The Raven at 14, literature in which she found 'so much emotion, strength and darkness'

This piece painted onto the top of an eyelid is called The Artist's Melancholia, accompanied with the quote 'I shut my eyes in order to see,' by Paul Gauguin

Little Red Riding Hood, 'Grandma, what big eyes you have' (l) and Cat Friends Gather Here/Yin and Yang - another take on Tal's 'cat-eye' look, this time with a fluffy new friend (r)

Tal's piece titled Sugar Rush was made using the following products for eyeshadow: Sleek ultra matte V1 palette + Concrete Minerals Pro-Matte eyeshadows + Monaco and Mehron aqua-colors

Her clever mixing techniques and steady 
hand have won her global acclaim - and have seen the trend for eye art 
move towards the same sphere occupied by nail art.

One of Tal's specialities is recreating famous movie scenes and characters on the eyelid, which can take her up to three hours.

To celebrate the release of new Disney flick Frozen, Tal created two bespoke looks based on the movie's sisters Elsa and Anna.

She also creates more simple designs using smattering of pearls, glitter and stars.
