A British soldier was killed by a Taliban bomb after blundering US troops failed to discover the 80kg device buried in a road.

Sergeant
Lee Davidson’s unit was given the green light to travel down a 
‘high-risk’ route in Afghanistan after American forces insisted one hour
earlier it was clear of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

But the US Army squad which used hi-tech detector vehicles to check the dirt track had missed the huge bomb.

Mother: Wife Samantha was left with the couple's children after her husband's death

Sgt Davidson – who had been looking 
out of the vehicle’s hatch – died when his armoured truck hit the huge 
IED and flipped onto its roof. 

His wife Samantha was seven months pregnant with their third child at the time.

An inquest criticised the  specialist US engineers for giving ‘inappropriate’ advice to UK commanders.

Coroner Nicola Mundy said there had been a ‘clear failure’ by the Americans to warn of the risks.

Sgt Davidson, of the Light Dragoons, was on patrol in Nahr-e Saraj, a Taliban hotspot in Helmand, on September 9 last year.

He was part of a mission to push insurgents from an area of land between two military bases.

The convoy set off down a dirt road when an IED exploded under his 19-tonne Ridgback armoured vehicle.

Sgt Davidson, 32, received severe  injuries and died despite immediate medical assistance.

The
blast had been activated by insurgents using a command wire buried at 
least four inches below the ground and the cable stretched about 200 
metres from the bomb crater to a firing point.

In
a written statement, a US Army officer – identified only as Soldier 5 –
said engineers drove along the route in vehicles with sensitive 
electronic equipment designed to detect buried IEDs.

Crucially,
he admitted US troops did not get out of their vehicles to carry out 
visual searches for disturbed ground or other signs insurgents had been 
there.

Lieutenant Colonel 
Carl Frankland, a British Army IED expert, said the bomb had been hidden
at a ‘vulnerable position’ in the road.

He
said it would have been ‘prudent’ for the US bomb detectors to dismount
from their vehicles to search for wires and other danger signs.

Superior: Major Chris Sargeant gave evidence at the inquest today and said he made the decision to take the road in a vehicle based on intelligence, but would not have done if he knew what he does now

Lt
Col Frankland told the coroner he would have recommended a ‘methodical 
approach’ to checking the road, involving soldiers on foot searching for
buried bombs using hand-held detectors or sniffer dogs.

He said: ‘The route itself was sufficiently risky. They should have stopped and dismounted the vehicle.

‘If they had discovered the command wire and cut it they may have been able to remove that IED.’

He acknowledged searching for bombs on foot was ‘very time-consuming’ and could have ‘delayed the mission’.

He added that  the Americans had a ‘different mindset’ towards discovering IEDs.

Major
Christopher Sargent, Sgt Davidson’s commanding officer, said: ‘I chose 
that route at the time because I thought it was the safest route, based 
on intelligence [provided by the US].

‘The
advice I got was to follow the route. I would have gone in on foot if I
had known what I know now. I made the call wrongly, but I made it in 
good faith.’

Comrades of Sgt Davidson, of  Thorne, South Yorkshire, described how ‘it went dark’ in the Ridgback when the IED exploded.

Sgt Davidson was barely breathing and died before reaching Camp Bastion hospital. 

Miss
Mundy said the US team had failed to provide proper risk advice. ‘There
was a clear failure to enter into dialogue about how best to manage 
this risk,’ she said. Since the tragedy, British troops have been issued
with new guidance on assessing routes.

Blast: Sergeant Lee Paul Davidson died after his Ridgeback vehicle, similar to the one pictured, was hit while patrolling with the Afghan Uniformed Police in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province

Recording
a verdict of unlawful killing, Miss Mundy also said the route had not 
been monitored around the clock by Danish troops – giving insurgents 
time to plant devices.

After
the inquest in Doncaster, Mrs Davidson said she and her three young 
children, Jayden, Jamie and Amelia Amber-Lee, were ‘so very proud’ of 
the soldier – who was helping to train Afghan police.

In
a statement she said: ‘The questions that our family had have been 
answered. We are satisfied that everything possible was done to try and 
save Lee’s life.

'We all miss Lee and are so very proud of him. He lives on in his family but especially in his three children he leaves behind.’

Sgt Davidson was the 427th member of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001.
