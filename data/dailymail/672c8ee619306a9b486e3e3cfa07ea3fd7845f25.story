A new rollercoaster at Alton Towers has been closed after plastic guard wheels came loose and hit front row riders.

A spokeswoman for the Staffordshire theme park said The Smiler, which at £18m is the resort's biggest investment, was shut yesterday afternoon after the 'technical issue'.

She said that as the ride was being pulled up the second lift hill some of the small, plastic guide wheels that are used to keep the chain inside the chain guard became detached.

'These were caught beneath the track in the safety netting, but regrettably several were flicked into the guests sitting in the front row of the train,' she said.

'Two of the guests were attended to by Park staff and all four remained on park for the rest of the afternoon.'

The 14-loop rollercoaster, which took over eight months to build, was shut for four days in July after a piece of track became dislodged, and was again closed for five days in August due to a technical issue.

The spokeswoman said an investigation had been launched to investigate the latest issue. 

The 14-loop rollercoaster, which took over eight months to build, has already been closed twice before

She said: 'As you would expect from the UK's most famous Theme Park, all of the rides and attractions are expected to meet extremely high standards, technologically, mechanically and in terms of the end experience and a full investigation is now on-going to determine when the ride can re-open.

'We are of course very sorry for any disappointment the ride's temporary closure is causing but the health and safety of all of our visitors is our absolute priority.'
