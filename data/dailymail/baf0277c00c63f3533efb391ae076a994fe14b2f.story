Charges could be dropped or greatly reduced against two young sisters accused in the fatal shooting of their 16-year-old brother, the lead prosecutor said on Tuesday.

Third Circuit State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister said he'll make a final decision about charges after a Thursday court hearing, which will also address options for the girls' care, given both of their parents were being held in jail.

The January 5 shooting resulted in the arrests of a 15-year-old girl and her 11-year-old sister on second-degree murder charges in Lake City, Florida. 

A 15-year-old girl (left) and her 11-year-old sister (right) are facing murder charges after the eldest girl fatally shot her 16-year-old brother at their Florida home last month. It was announced today that the charges could be greatly reduced after the eldest girl suffered years of physical and sexual abuse

Documents show the elder girl had suffered years of physical and sexual abuse.

In documents seen by Daily Mail Online last month, the eldest girl had been sexually abused for years by an uncle. 

In 2011, the brother and sister were discovered having sex by their mother. 

Investigators said the elder girl was held in a locked bedroom by her older brother while their parents were away on a work trip. 

The father, a truck driver, and his wife, who often went with him, left the 16-year-old boy to watch over the girls and their three-year-old sister, police said.

After the brother fell asleep, the girl convinced the younger sister to unlock the door so she could shower, police reports stated.

The elder sister asked the younger to keep watch while she climbed through the window of her parents' locked bedroom, where she retrieved a pistol, police said.

With gun in hand, the girl asked her younger sister to take their three-year-old sister and hide in a closet before she shot her brother in the neck as he slept, police said.

The two older girls fled the house, leaving the toddler behind. 

They were later found by police outside a Dollar General store after the younger girl called a friend saying she needed a ride.

Documents show the elder girl was locked in her bedroom regularly for days with only a blanket and a bucket to use the bathroom. 

Her parents had also removed her from school, documents show.

The longest they kept the girl locked in her room was 20 consecutive days, the father told police.

In the room, police found only a blanket and a bucket filled with urine in the closet, allegedly a punishment because the teenage girl was stealing and talking back. 

The boy, 16, was shot dead by his sister on January 5. The mother had earlier caught the brother and sister having sex

Letters from the parents asking her why she should be let out of that room were also found in the police investigation.

'It was learned that (the 15-year-old girl) has made past attempts at ending her life but neither law enforcement nor (emergency management services) was notified,' police wrote in their January report.

Police documents released last month said the eldest girl's uncle was convicted of molesting her in 2010.

The uncle was arrested in December 2010 on sex charges after his wife found a USB with movie clips of him and the 15-year-old engaged in sexual acts. It had been going on for some time. 

According to police documents, his wife reported seeing a video clip of the girl sitting down and a man with his penis out, standing behind her. 

He then had oral sex with the underage girl, while she made noises, the wife told police. 

The victim later told investigators that she did not want it to happen. 

The uncle had told her to 'suck on his thingy' and that 'they were to be private and not to tell anyone no matter what'.

The abuse had been going on 'for a long time', according to the police report, and the videotaping for about a year.

The uncle was convicted and is on the registered sex offender's list.

Police documents also revealed that the children's mother discovered the siblings having sex in 2011. 

The mother reported to police that she heard noises coming from the bedroom and found the teenage boy having sex with his sister, who is a year younger. 

The mother told police that she separated the siblings and asked them what happened.

The girl told her mother that she did not want to 'do it'  with her brother but he put pressure on her. She also referenced the earlier abuse by her uncle.

Siegmeister said the alleged abuse and neglect, along with the girls' ages, are being considered in any charges. 

If they were convicted as juveniles of second-degree murder the pair would spend until their 21st birthdays in prison.

The parents currently face charges of felony child neglect, and the 3-year-old is being cared for by child welfare officials.

The members of the family are not being named because of the girls' ages and because of abuse allegations.

The parents have been charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The girls' mother told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved
