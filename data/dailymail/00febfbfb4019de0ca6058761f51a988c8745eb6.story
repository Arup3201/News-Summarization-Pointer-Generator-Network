Retired Miami Dolphins player Mark Duper confirmed on Friday that he has a concussion-related brain disease.

Mr Duper, 54, is the latest former player to reveal he is suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

The former football star was tested at UCLA in California after suffering from headaches and general pain in his body. Other symptoms include depression and memory loss.

Mr Duper, who beat renal cancer two years ago, told NBC: 'The way I look at it, I know what I’m dealing with.'

Former Dallas Cowboys great and football Hall of Famer Tony Dorsett, 59,  was also diagnosed with CTE this week.

Up until recently, the only way to diagnose CTE was by studying brain tissue after death, but a UCLA research team has pioneered a brain-imaging technique that identifies a build-up of abnormal proteins called tau in the brain.

The other players diagnosed were Hall of Fame offensive lineman Joe DeLamielleure, 62, and former All-Pro defensive lineman Leonard Marshall, 52.

Duper, nicknamed Super Duper, played 11 seasons for the Dolphins, the best being 1984 and 1986.
