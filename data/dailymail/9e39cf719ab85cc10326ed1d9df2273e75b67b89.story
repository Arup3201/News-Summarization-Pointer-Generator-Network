ESPN college football analyst Ed Cunningham believes that Johnny Manziel could become an elite-level NFL quarterback, but also fears for his safety.

The rookie from Texas A&M was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in May, and Cunningham thinks Manziel has all the tools to make it right to the very top.

Manziel was named back-up to Brian Hoyer by Browns head coach Mike Pettine, but Cunningham, who played college football for Washington before spending five years in the NFL with Arizona and Seattle, thinks the rookie will go from strength to strength.

New challenge: Johnny Manziel is set to embark on his rookie year with the Cleveland Browns

He said: 'It's all about if he can survive physically because I think Johnny Manziel is a terrific quarterback and people don't give him enough credit for how well he throws the ball and how accurate he can be.

'He has incredible work-rate. If you don't have the work ethic you won't break through, but he does. He is a really hard-working guy who enjoys working on his craft.

'My concern for the young man is that he is going to get a lot of injuries that will add up because the season is so long in the NFL. I think he is good enough to be an elite-level quarterback but I wonder if his body is going to hold up.'

Manziel has been under the microscope this summer for his partying and off-field behaviour and admitted to a 'rookie mistake'.

Spotlight: The former Texas A&M quarterback was selected in the first round of the 2014 draft

During a pre-season game against the Washington Redskins, Manziel was seen showing his middle finger to the opposition bench.

But Cunningham said: 'I enjoyed my NFL life as a single guy with a lot of money in my pocket living in Scottsdale, Arizona so it is hard for me to comdemn him. I would have pulled him aside and had a very stern conversation - but that's what my locker room was like.

'The term I like to use for people like Johnny is that they have to have their jersey a bit dirty before they're ready to compete. He is the guy who had to engage his opponent in he theatrics rather than just playing. The problem is the NFL is full of people who were the best player at their college. I played five years in the NFL and, with the level of the hits, I fear for his safety.'

Manziel threw 63 touchdown passes during his time at Texas A&M and won college football's prestigious Heisman Trophy in 2012.

Revolution: The new college football season sees the introduction of a play-off system

The college football season began on Thursday night and the best teams in America will battle for a place in the National Championship game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

This season also sees the introduction of a new play-off system, where four teams will enter a semi-finals and final bracket, replacing the former BCS method where the top two teams were selected for the National Championship game.

'The play-off is something this sport has probably needed for a long time. For the players, fans and coaches, this is a really historic season that we finally have a play-off.

'We will now more closely find the true champion of our spot because the truth is we haven't always been very accurate or very good at that.'
