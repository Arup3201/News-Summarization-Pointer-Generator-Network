Five-year-old Chayce Kofe, who went missing at Pearl Beach on the Central Coast on Thursday

The search for a five-year-old boy feared drowned on the NSW Central Coast is being scaled back with rescuers failing to find any sign of the boy.

Chayce Kofe was playing with relatives on the shoreline at Pearl Beach on Thursday afternoon when a large wave swept him into the ocean.

It is understood he struggled behind the break for a short time as people on paddle boards tried to reach him.

The underwater search effort for the missing child resumed today but police confirmed it will be abandoned if divers find no trace of the young boy's body.

'We've searched where we've hoped we would find the child and we haven't (found him),' a police spokeswoman said.

'If we don't find him today, we would have to scale back the resources pending more information.'

She told Daily Mail Australia earlier it will be the last underwater dive as rescuers prepare to wind back the recovery operation to a 'grid search' of the region, which will include foot patrols, sweeps of the area and an air search 'several times a day.'

'If anything changes, (the divers) will come straight back again but worse case scenario and nothing is found this afternoon they will return to Sydney,' she said.

She said rescuers will then focus on 'sweeps of the ocean and on foot several times a day'.

A massive sea and air search at Pearl Beach on the Central coast to find the missing five-year-old boy turned to a recovery operation on Friday

A full-scale search involving helicopters, police divers and surf lifesavers on Thursday afternoon and throughout Friday failed to find the young boy.

Police concede the operation has moved to body recovery.

The boy's father Daniel Kelly pledged on Facebook to find his son 'or die trying'.

'Daddy is so sorry son ... I luv [sic] you forever Chaycee,' Mr Kelly posted.

'It would never of happened if I was [there]. It's just not fair and I can't handle dat [sic] my son has been ripped away from me and I have no control over da [sic] outcome.'

Chayce, who lived on the NSW Central Coast, was holidaying with extended family in the coastal hamlet.

His distraught mother arrived at the scene on Friday.

Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings said on Friday that the visibility for divers was quite poor and a large swell along the coast was affecting the current.

Wella Kupu revealed the family's heartbreak,
 begged for her 'sweet' nephew Chayce Kofe to be brought home safely as 
the full-scale search for him turned into a recovery operation at Pearl 
Beach on Friday.

'Heading
 to Umina to be with my family... may the lord give us strength today 
and bring our Little Chayce home to us,' she wrote on Facebook.

Ms
 Kupu posted photos of Chayce on her page as tributes poured in for the 
young boy who has been missing since 1.50pm on Thursday.

On Thursday evening Ms Kupe wrote: 'Devastated to loose my little nephew today ... we will find Chayce ... Loving you always Aunty Wella.'

Another post read: 'Devastating news for our family today...the passing of our nephew Chayce Kofe....Where there are no words know the silence are carrying the thoughts and prayers of all who love you Chayce.'

'I may have only held you in my arms for a moment.....But i will HOLD you im my heart forever Chayce... Loving you always [sic],' she added.

Detective Superintendent Hutchings said on Friday the search had turned into a recovery operation.

'We always hold out some hope but my experience tells me that we have been going for some time and unfortunately I think we are in the recovery stage,' the Marine Area Commander told reporters.

'And that is quite tragic and our hearts and thoughts do go out to the family this morning.'

The boy's family arrived on the beach are being comforted by police and counsellors.

Locals from the small coastal community say the tragedy is heartbreaking.

'Pearl Beach is a very special place because it's a real community even though there is not a lot of permanent residents here,' general store owner Kevin McCunn said.

'It feels like a tragedy for the community.'

It is understood that most of the family were not confident in the water.

Surf lifesavers told Fairfax Media the boy's family might not have been able to save him.

'They're not sure whether anybody could actually swim,' a spokeswoman for Surf Life Saving NSW said.

Acting Superintendent Paul Nicholls said the young boy, who was staying with extended family in a house opposite the beach, was with a group of family and friends, including children, at the time of the incident.

Acting Superintendent Nicholls said friends and family tried unsuccessfully to grab the boy but were unable to reach him.

A full scale search resumed on Friday morning as soon as it was light

A command post had been set up and was manned overnight on Thursday

'We understand that some of the people that he was with have gone into the water to go and assist but they were unable to locate him,' he told the ABC.

Locals turned up at the beach offered to help the grief-stricken family.

Resident Mandy Harris told AAP the waves were very dangerous when the boy was swept into the ocean.

'They were the biggest I have ever seen and I have lived here for eight years,' she said.

'The trouble is there is a lot of undertows in the ocean.'

Pearl Beach general store owner Kevin McCunn said the suspected drowning is a real tragedy for the tight-knit, beachside community.

Brisbane Water Local Area Command, the Marine Area Command and Surf Life Saving Australia all took to the waters

He said the northern end of the beach, where the young boy was playing, was a dangerous spot.

'It's been rough seas the last few days and at the north end of the beach it can be quite dangerous,' he said.

A resident told the Sydney Morning Herald a young boy was the last person to spot the child in the surf.

'The child was only spotted once [in the surf], I believe, and he was actually playing at the north end of the beach and that's the rough end,' she said.

The resident, who did not want to be named, also claimed the five-year-old was playing with siblings.

A frantic search failed to find the boy on Thursday

Dye was released into the water during the search in order to determine the direction of the currents.

A nearby restaurant owner said people on the beach were 'totally beside themselves' after hearing the news.

'We all feel sick to our stomach, we are worried about the poor parents,' Melissa, from Pearls on the Beach restaurant told TVNZ.

The picturesque coastal hamlet has been a popular destination with school holidays taking place over the past week.

However the beach is not patrolled.
