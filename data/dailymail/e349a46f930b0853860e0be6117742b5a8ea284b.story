He is well known for his memorable comments and knack of saying the wrong thing.

So perhaps it is only fitting that the Duke of Edinburgh now has one of his own phrases immortalised in the Oxford English Dictionary.

The latest edition is expected to say that Prince Philip introduced the term 'blue-arsed fly', after he was recorded publicly scolding a photographer in 1970.

The colourful expression will now be 
attributed to him, unless anyone else can provide evidence that another 
person used the phrase in public.

The Duke of Edinburgh will make it into the Oxford English Dictionary's pages for his choice of language

The Duke was apparently annoyed by a 
group of reporters and tourists and questioned a photographer who was 
taking pictures of him whether he was getting enough shots.

When the photographer said that he 
hoped so the Duke snapped: 'You should do. You have been running around 
like a blue-arsed fly.'

The Times reported the phrase - which
describes someone in a constant flurry of activity - on April 22, 1970,
and since then it has become a common phrase.

The OED's search for earlier uses of the word comes as part of their public online appeal to help trace the origins of words.

Launched yesterday, the compendium's 
editors need help in unearthing new information about the history and 
usage of English, including the earliest examples of particular words.

They suspect that the phrased attributed to Prince Philip has earlier roots.

They said: 'The r-less blue-assed fly, however, is attested from at least 1932.  Why such a discrepancy?

'Since our original OED entry was published in 2005, we’ve discovered an earlier example of blue-arsed fly in a dictionary of slang from 1949, but we suspect there may be evidence out there that is earlier still.'

Prince Philip is credited with the phrase after becoming annoyed

They are also seeking help from anyone who knows the origin of 'in your dreams', 'Bellini' and 'come in from the cold.'

In their appeal, Chief Editor of the OED, John Simpson, explains how the OED Appeals initiative will help the team to revise the OED: 'When researching and revising entries, our team of editors use the OED’s famous citation files, gathered over more than a century, as well as the latest digitized databases and Corpus evidence.

'Nonetheless, the very first recorded usage of many words can be difficult to track down.

'We can trace certain words and phrases back only so far with conventional tools.

'An old takeaway menu, a family letter or album, or an obscure journal might hold the key to solving one of those mysteries.”OED editor Katherine Connor Martin also said: 'The OED’s record of the history of English was relying on input from the public more than a century before the term ‘crowdsourcing’ was even coined.

'James Murray launched an appeal to the public as far back as 1879, and the OED Appeals continues this long tradition of asking the public for help in our quest to record the origins of our vast, fantastic, ever-changing lexicon.

'After all, when it comes to the words we read, write, speak, and hear each day, every one of us is an expert.'

Prince Philip admits that he has a unique way of expressing himself.

He described as 
'Dontopedalogy . . . the science of opening your mouth and putting your 
foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years.'

What's he said this time? The Duke is known for using colourful expressions, which he has used when on tour with the Queen

On his daughter, Princess Anne, he said: ‘If it doesn’t fart or eat hay, she isn’t interested.’

In 2001, he made his feelings clear about Elton John's choice of vehicle.

He said the singer after hearing that he had sold his Watford 
FC-themed Aston Martin : ‘Oh, it’s you that owns that ghastly 
car, is it? We often see it when driving to Windsor Castle.’

On being offered fine Italian wines by Prime
Minister Giuliano Amato at a dinner in Rome in 2000, he said: ‘Get me a beer. I don’t care what kind 
it is, just get me a beer!’
