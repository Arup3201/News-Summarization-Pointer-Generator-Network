ACTION PLAN 

Wisteria will benefit greatly from being pruned in late summer — and certainly again this month.

In August, you should have removed all the long, wispy summer growths, cutting each back to a stump with seven leaves along the length.

It helps even more if you now shorten those stumps further, to about three buds.

While summer pruning stimulates flower production, this month's cuts will enhance bloom quality.

If you didn't prune your wisteria last summer, don't despair. You should still enjoy plenty of spring blossom and the plant's health will not be compromised.

But pruning makes these rampant climbers far easier to manage and also helps develop a handsome gnarled appearance.

Twice-yearly pruning also encourages the plant to develop more spurs — the short growths that carry most of the blossom.

READER'S QUESTION

We planted a Christmas rose last year and enjoyed the flowers for months. But now the leaves have large black spots and there aren't many flowers. Is there a cure?

Mrs M. Lucas, Norfolk.

Black marks on leaves and flower stems are caused by fungal disease Hellebore Leaf Spot. Prevent its spread by removing all affected leaves and stems as soon as any spots appear. Treatment with a fungicide such as myclobutanil is worth a try — though it is not specifically recommended by suppliers.

CHECK WINTER CONTAINERS

Make sure outdoor containers are draining properly and the drainage holes are not plugged up by soil

Ensure outdoor containers are draining as they should. Modern potting composts tend to compact as they decompose in the winter and that reduces their ability to let water drain away.

Ants can also can block drainage holes by carrying soil particles into the bottom of the containers over time. This sets like clay, creating a plug.

If drainage holes are blocked plants suffer root damage and can die. So, if you are able, lift each container to make sure there are no obstructions.

Large tubs are difficult to inspect but you do need to make sure they drain properly. You can stand large containers on little 'feet' to raise them a centimetre or so above the ground.

This helps to prevent the holes clogging. You can buy manufactured 'feet' for big pots, but I find pieces of broken tile work almost as well and cost nothing.

CARE FOR YOUR AMARYLLIS

Now is the time to take care of your Amaryllis (pictured) water the pot regularly and feed weekly

If you were given an amaryllis for Christmas, it will need some attention now.

These bulbs, more correctly called Hippeastrum, are among Britain's most popular winter houseplants. But most people dump them when their huge blooms have died.

That's a shame because they're easy to bring into flower year after year.

To do this, water the pot regularly while the flowers are alive and feed once a week as soon as leaves appear with a houseplant fertiliser such as Baby Bio Original.

Allow the handsome, straplike leaves to develop and keep the plants in a conservatory, frost-free greenhouse or near a window. They can spend summer outside, in full sun.

Continue to feed while the leaves still grow. In July, stop watering, let the leaves wither and dry before cutting off. Water again from September and bring the plant back indoors before the first frost.

PLANT OF THE WEEK 

The silk tassel bush, Garrya elliptica, which originates from the western coastal regions of the U.S., is one of the great joys of winter.

Its evergreen leaves are quietly pretty with gently wavy edges. These make a perfect foil for the pale green catkins, which are wonderfully long and hang plumb-line straight.

Long catkins appear only on male plants — the females have more stumpy fruits.

And it's worth selecting a named clone such as James Roof or the more wavy-leaved Evie.

Garrya is hardy in much of Britain, but will suffer in excessively cold regions.

It can be wall-trained, for extra protection, and needs to grow in a sunny position to produce good catkins.
