Filipe Luis is poised to complete his drawn out move to Chelsea after the clubs agreed a £20million fee.

The 28-year-old Brazilian had been banished to train with the reserves after expressing a desire to follow Diego Costa to Stamford Bridge.

Atletico had already bought a replacement in Granada’s Guilherme Siquiera but have refused to allow Luis to go until Chelsea agreed to pay the buy-out clause.

 are already losing Costa and Tiago Mendes while goalkeeper Thibaut

Luis has formed a good 
friendship with Courtois and the two will help each other at Stamford 
Bridge.

Chelsea manager Jose
 Mourinho has also renewed his interest in Real Madrid defender Raphael 
Varane, who is seeking assurances that he will become a regular starter 
at Real.

Carlo Ancelotti does not want to sell but Chelsea are willing to offer more than £30million if they sense a deal can be done.

 Besiktas have denied agreeing a deal to sign Demba Ba and Marik Marin 
on loan from Chelsea despite reports on Turkish TV.
