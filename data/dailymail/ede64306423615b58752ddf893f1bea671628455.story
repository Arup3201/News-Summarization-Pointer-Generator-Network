Brazilians already downhearted at missing out on reaching the World Cup final watched in dismay last night as their national team lost to the Netherlands 3-0 in the third-place match.

Across the nation, fans hoping for some redemption were crushed as Brazil failed to score - and said their only solace was that the country managed to put on a good World Cup show for the world.

Any hope among supporters in Brasilia that their team could restore national pride after the infamous 7-1 beating by Germany last Tuesday ran for less than three minutes - when the first goal went in.

Disappointed again: Fans of Brazil had been hoping that their team could restore national pride after the infamous 7-1 beating by Germany last Tuesday

Brazilian soldier Julio Cesar Carioca compared his connection with Brazil's team to life itself. ‘You go into things with great expectations, but rarely do those expectations play out in reality,’ Mr Carioca said. ‘It's football. Things happen.’

In Rio, tens of thousands of fans watched the game on a massive TV on Copacabana Beach and the mostly Brazilian crowd stood in silence as the Netherlands knocked in one goal after another.

Argentine fans who have flooded into the city ahead of their country's final match against Germany today cheered and chanted songs mocking Brazil's football prowess.

At the Alzirao street fest in Rio where thousands cheered Brazil in earlier tournament games, only a few hundred showed up on Saturday.

Small business owner Angelica Morellato Seabra was among them wearing Brazil's national team jersey. She was disgusted with the outcome.

‘I'm trying to forget the whole thing, but it's going to be difficult,’ said Ms Seabra, 56. ‘If you draw you forget, but if you lose like we do, forgetting is impossible.’

On Copacabana Beach, university 
student Luiz de Almeira shook his head in dismay each time Brazil seemed
 like it would score but missed opportunities.

‘I'm proud of being Brazilian but I'm mad because we could have been making history,’ the 20-year-old business student said.

‘The team has not shown what it is 
capable of doing and the only salvation is that Brazil has managed to 
show it could pull off a good World Cup.’

Nathalia Gomes, an 18-year-old high 
school student, said she hoped Brazil's World Cup would be remembered 
more for the people's hospitality than for the national team's losses, 
especially Brazil's 7-1 thrashing by Germany.

‘This World Cup should go down in 
history for the friendliness of the fans, for the party we through and 
not for the 7-1 defeat,’ said Ms Gomes, who watched the game from 
Alzirao.

Artur Jose, a 33-year-old 
administrative assistant, said Brazil's team for the 2014 tournament 
will be remembered as its worst ever.

‘We didn't have any sort of strategy, 
no cohesion, no game and only one good player,’ he said, referring to 
Neymar, who was knocked out of the competition with an injury.

‘The one good thing that might come 
out of this humiliation would be if people remember this feeling at the 
ballot boxes during the elections’ in October to select a new president.

‘Brazil is going through hard times: On the pitch and off,’ he said.

While many Brazilians objected to the billions spent to put on the World Cup, few protests materialized during the event.

But 66-year-old Magali Garcia Linares 
said the team's terrible performance reinforced her opposition to big 
spending by Brazil for international sporting events. The country next 
hosts the 2016 Olympics.

‘How can you hold an event like this 
in a country with zero health, zero education?’ she asked. ‘The 
quantities that were spent were vast and in vain.

‘For this World Cup, the only things 
that were done were the visible things that foreigners would see and 
notice. The invisible things, things that really matter, were left 
undone.’

Louis van Gaal will arrive in 
Manchester this week as a winner after heaping more misery on Brazil’s 
wretched World Cup campaign.

Van Gaal is set to be unveiled at Old 
Trafford on Thursday with his reputation enhanced from a rewarding month
 in South America that saw Holland qualify from the Group of Death and 
last night complete an impressive third-place finish.

For Brazil, while they weren’t 
thrashed quite as badly as they had been against Germany in Tuesday 
night’s historic semi-final, a second successive heavy defeat on home 
soil was a devastating end to a campaign which promised so much.

Manager Felipe Scolari, a World Cup winner in 2002, surely won’t be able to survive this.

He’s been accused by 200 million 
people of picking the wrong players and choosing the wrong tactics. On 
last night’s evidence in Brasilia, they aren’t all be wrong.

Holland carried on where Germany left 
off with two goals in the opening 17 minutes – both the result of 
blunders from Brazilian centre-backs Thiago Silva and David Luiz.

The South Americans huffed and puffed 
after that without ever suggesting they had the quality to launch a 
fightback and Georgino Wijnaldum completed the humiliation in 
injury-time.

Scolari made six changes from the team humiliated by Germany for a third-place play-off which for once carried some meaning.

Van Gaal stuck with his big guns Arjen
 Robben and Robin van Persie though Wesley Sneijder didn’t last beyond 
the warm-up after tweaking a hamstring and had to be replaced by 
Jonathan de Guzman of Swansea City.

After three minutes of the game last 
night, Silva, who missed the semi-final debacle through suspension, 
wasn’t strong enough to stop van Persie from turning midway in the 
Brazilian half and releasing Robben.

As the Bayern forward sped towards the
 penalty area, Silva gave a despairing tug at the back of his shirt. The
 connection probably happened just outside the penalty area but Robben 
fell inside, and referee Djamel Halmoudi awarded a penalty that van 
Persie converted high and hard.

The only consolation for Brazil was 
that Silva escaped with just a yellow card when he’d clearly denied 
Robben a goalscoring opportunity.

By 17 minutes, Brazil had conceded again leading to fears of another humiliating drubbing.

Luiz was again the fall-guy, heading a
 clearance straight to Daley Blind who had time to take two touches to 
control the ball with his left foot and then dispatch a finish with his 
right into the roof of the net past Julio Cesar.

Brazil looked shellshocked but while 
Germany were hungry for more goals on Tuesday night, the Dutch were 
happy to sit back until they got opportunities to hit the hosts on the 
counter-attack.

Oscar started to see more of the ball 
and was unlucky that his whipped-in free-kick didn’t get a decisive 
touch off Chelsea team-mate Willian or Jo.

One solo run and shot by Oscar was saved by Jasper Cillessen – Brazil’s only effort on target in the entire first half.

Even in low gear, Holland seemed more 
likely to score. Van Persie had a low shot saved by Julio Cesar and when
 the Dutch broke, they met little resistance from a woeful Brazilian 
midfield.

Scolari, whose job looks certain end 
sooner rather than later, made a change at the interval with Manchester 
City’s Fernandinho replacing Luis Gustavo.

Gustavo’s only contribution of the 
opening 45 minutes had been to leave Dirk Kuyt with a nasty gash on the 
back of his head with a wayward arm.

But it didn’t improve much for Brazil 
after half-time. The harder poor Luiz tried, the worse it got for him as
 he gave the ball away with regularity.

The scorer of an incredible free-kick 
against Colombia couldn’t beat Cillessen with a relatively tame effort 
when given a shooting chance from 25 yards.

Jose Mourinho must be thinking he’s a genius for selling the shaggy-haired defender for £40million before the World Cup.

His former Chelsea team-mate Oscar 
didn’t fare much better. He was booked for diving when he ran into Blind
 and then somersaulted in the air looking for a penalty.  Poor Blind had
 to be carried off with a hurt knee as a result of the coming-together 
and Daryl Janmaat replaced him for the last 20 minutes.

By the time Scolari introduced Hulk for the latter stages, you knew he and the entire nation were desperate.

It was no surprise when the muscular 
forward got himself into a good shooting position and then took a wild 
swipe at the ball to send it wide.

Van Gaal was angry that Robben – who admitted diving earlier in the tournament – had two decent penalty appeals turned down.

But ultimately, it didn’t matter. In 
fact, Janmaat crossed for Wijaldum to make it 3-0 and van Gaal was able 
to send on third-choice goalkeeper Michel Vorm to ensure all 23 of his 
players in Brazil had tasted some action - a nice touch.

The contrast between the relaxed way 
Holland’s players found space and knocked the ball around compared to 
the hypertension in Brazil’s game was evident.

If van Gaal can replicate it at Old Trafford, the fallen champions will be more than happy.
