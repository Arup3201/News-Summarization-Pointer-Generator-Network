As EU leaders arrived at an emergency summit today to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, onlookers could be forgiven for thinking they were seeing double.

With his oh so smooth forehead, hair swept back and hazel eyes, David Cameron addressed the media... as did his doppelganger - Luxembourg's prime minister, Xavier Bettel.

Like Cameron, he wore a navy suit, plumping for pinstripes, possibly to help avoid confusion.

David Cameron attended an emergency EU summit today to discuss the Ukraine-Crimea crisis... and also present was PM lookalike Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg (that's him on the right)

The similarities don't end there: both men (born seven years apart) head up a coalition government: Cameron with the Lib Dems; Bettel (the liberal Democratic Party) with Luxembourg's Socialist Workers' Party and Green Party.

If that wasn't strange enough, before becoming PM, Bettel worked as a barrister - the same profession as David's elder brother, Alex Cameron QC.

Brothers in arms, indeed.

The EU leaders were holding an emergency summit at the EU headquarters in Brussels to discuss a response to Russia's troop deployment in Ukraine's Crimea.

Cameron is married with three children; while Bettel is his country's first openly gay PM and is in a relationship with architect Destenay Gauthier

During the talks, the leaders agreed a limited package of sanctions to be put in place with immediate effect.

They warned Russia of 'far-reaching consequences' unless it enters into direct talks with the Ukraine government to end the crisis.

And they warned of further measures, including asset freezes and travel bans, unless there was swift action.

Mr Cameron said: 'We cannot accept Russia creating new facts on the ground without these talks taking place.

'Illegal actions committed by Russia cannot pass without a response. It cannot be business as usual with Russia.

'If Russia does not rapidly engage in direct talks with the Ukrainian government to find a solution to this crisis, we have been clear in the statement today that we will go further.'

Immediate measures include suspending negotiations on a more liberal visa regime for Russians, halting work on a comprehensive new agreement on relations with the EU, and suspending preparations for the G8 summit in Sochi.
