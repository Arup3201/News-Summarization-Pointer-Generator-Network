A man who beat his pregnant ex-fiancee to death causing the death of their unborn baby has been jailed for at least 27 years.

Unemployed alcoholic Tony McLernon, 24, of Harlow, Essex, was found guilty of murder and child destruction following a trial lasting just over two weeks at Chelmsford Crown Court.

The trial heard he lured Eystna Blunnie, 20, to her death in July last year after telling friends she was trying to ruin his new relationship.

Jailed: Tony McLernon, of Harlow, Essex, was found guilty of murder

When they met in Howard Way, near her home in Harlow, he jumped on her, kicked her and left her to die in a pool of blood.

Miss Blunnie was due to give birth to a girl within days.

Ordering a minimum tariff of 27 years
of a life sentence, Mr Justice Fulford said: 'It is undoubtedly the 
case that he brutally and repeatedly attacked Eystna Blunnie during the 
course of their relationship.

'He told friends he wanted her significantly harmed or killed. In April he strangled her, causing the baby distress.

'This killing was not the result of 
an unthinking moment of anger but instead he had contemplated the attack
over a long period of time.

'The killing was truly terrible. The 
horrific screams heard by those nearby show the suffering and pain she 
suffered and for some period of time she would have been aware of the 
fatal consequences for herself and her child.

'He has shown not the slightest shred of remorse.'

McLernon showed no emotion as he was led from the dock.

Outside court, Miss Blunnie's uncle, Tony Blunnie, read a statement on behalf of her family.He said: 'After a very long and heart-breaking eight months, we have finally received justice for Eystna and her then soon-to-be- born daughter, Rose.

'Eystna was a loving girl with a unique personality and her whole life ahead of her.

'We know Rose would have been loved, nurtured and given the best in life that's possible. We are pleased the jury saw through his lies and saw him as the evil person he truly was.'

When questioned by police McLernon claimed she had been attacked by two men and he had been unable to defend her.

But the jury took just two hours to find him guilty of both murder and child destruction yesterday.

Final moments: McLernon will be sentenced today for the murder of Miss Blunnie, seen in CCTV footage on the night of her death

Miss Blunnie’s family released a statement after the verdict which said: 'In June of 2012 our 
family was shattered by the death of a loving daughter, Eystna, and her 
unborn child, Rose.

'The worst part was to find out that their deaths were such a brutal murder.

'However today justice has prevailed for our daughter and granddaughter with the conviction of their killer.'

Speaking outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Lucy Robinson said: 'Tony McLernon is a dangerous, violent man.

'He has subjected numerous ex-girlfriends to constant fear of being 
assaulted, and Eystna paid the ultimate price during his final violent 
outburst.

'What he has taken away from the Blunnie family can never be replaced, 
but I hope he never has the opportunity to put another family through 
the pain they continue to suffer.'

McLernon, of North Grove,
Harlow, had earlier told the court how he had been drinking more than 
20 litres of cider and Lambrini a day and was addicted to the computer 
game Guitar Hero at the time of the attack.

He described how he would rarely leave his bedroom, instead spending hours on end playing the Xbox game.

The court heard how the couple got 
engaged in 2011 after meeting on Facebook but their relationship 
deteriorated and they split up early in 2012.

In the weeks leading up to the killing 
he had told friends and family that Miss Blunnie was trying to ruin his 
new relationship, telling one he expected to go to prison for what he 
planned to do.

Giving evidence, McLernon said he had been 'over the moon' about the 
impending birth adding that, in the days leading up to Miss Blunnie’s 
death, they had been getting on well.

He said that his drinking and gaming habits put strain on his relationship with Miss Blunnie.

Unemployed McLernon told the court that his drinking began at the age of 16.

For
several years he had met friends in a park near his Harlow home and 
would drink up to 12 pints of lager most nights, he said.

As his alcoholism, funded by Jobseeker’s Allowance, worsened, he sought out cheaper and stronger drinks.

He said: 'A group of us would meet by a bench and drink. I would normally have about 12 pints of lager.

'But in 2012 my drinking changed significantly.

'I
would buy two or three litre bottles of strong cider from the 
supermarket and mix it with Lambrini to make a drink with 13 per cent 
alcohol.

'We called it rocket fuel. By the middle of the year I was drinking a mix of 10 or 11 bottles per day.

'I would be sick, vomiting everywhere, falling out of bed and at times the ambulance would have to be called.'

Describing the moment Eystna was supposedly attacked by two men, McLernon said: 'I saw the two men run off up a path and, when I saw Eystna injured in the street, I nearly screamed.'

He said he tried to put his former partner in the recovery position.

'There was more blood than I care to remember and she made a horrible sound,' McLernon added.

'I tried to turn my phone on but it took a while to load up. There wasn't anything I could do.

'I saw one of the men running back towards me so I panicked and I ran.

'I
was in no fit state to try to defend her - the look in his eyes was 
terrible and I thought he was going to give me a kicking.'

He added that he had not been able to tell anybody about what happened that night because 'it made me feel sick'.

CCTV footage captured a heavily-pregnant Eystna Blunnie, a catering student and barmaid, walking through the Harlow estate to meet McLernon talking on her mobile phone.

She was due to give birth to a girl within days when she died.

She told McLernon she was pregnant with his child in October 2011 but they broke up the following year.

He said that he had been 'over the moon' about the impending birth and that the pair had been getting on well.

Asked if the text message was part of a
scheme to tempt her to meet him, he said 'absolutely not' adding the 
surprise was that he had brought his dog, Alan, to see her.

McLernon, who said he had suffered 
from depression and was prone to self-harm, denied claims he had 
physically abused her and previous partners.
