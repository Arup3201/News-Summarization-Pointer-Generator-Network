More time: Lawyers for John Hinckley, who tried to kill President Reagan, are trying to allow him to spend more time with his mother at her home in Virginia

The man who shot and wounded President Ronald Reagan has been spending too much time at a psychiatric hospital and should instead spend more time at his mother's Virginia home, his lawyer said Monday.

The lawyer for would-be assassin John Hinckley claims that he should be allowed to spend additional time away from the hospital where he has lived since being found insane at the time he shot Reagan in 1981.

Hinckley has been gradually given more freedom from Washington's St. Elizabeths Hospital, and at the end of 2005 he was given permission to start making overnight visits to his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia.

The visits now last 10 days and they are carefully planned, and Hinckley is sometimes trailed by the Secret Service.

Attorney Barry Levine argued that 
Hinckley, who attended the proceeding, 'has done nothing dangerous at 
all for more than two decades' and has earned more time in Virginia.

'Mr. Hinckley has been spending too 
much time in the hospital,' Levine said, later adding that keeping him 
at the hospital is 'disguised prison.'

Lawyers spent two weeks in late 2011 
and early 2012 discussing plans that would expand the length of 
Hinckley's visits to Virginia, first to 17 days and then to 24 days.

After those visits, which could take a
year to complete, Hinckley could be allowed to live permanently outside
the hospital while making monthly visits to St. Elizabeths. But the 
plan hit a snag after hearings.

St. Elizabeths had planned for 
Hinckley to attend group programs at a treatment facility called 
People's Place while visiting his mother's home, but the facility 
withdrew its participation.

St. Elizabeths and the facility 
apparently couldn't agree on the people managing Hinckley's case. St. 
Elizabeths now proposes that Hinckley join a therapy group run by a 
psychotherapist he sees in Virginia. He also would participate in music 
therapy with another specialist.

Colleen Kennedy, a government 
attorney, criticized the solution and called it a 'patchwork quilt.' She
also raised questions about Hinckley's ability to drive now that he has
a driver's license.

'He could drive anywhere, including to D.C. and see President Obama,' Kennedy said.

Insane: A jury found him not-guilty-by-insanity in 1982 when he was just 26 and he was committed to St Elizabeth's Hospital. Hinckley holds a pistol to his head in this self-portrait and obtained from court records in Oct. 1982

Date: Hinckley's assassination attempt occurred on March 30, 1981, just 69 days into Ronald Reagan's presidency

The government has previously said in 
documents filed with the court that Hinckley is 'a man capable of great 
violence' and 'not sufficiently well to alleviate the concern that this 
violence may be repeated.'

Levine has disagreed, saying in court Monday that Hinckley's mental illness has been in remission for two decades.

'No one says that John Hinckley will be a danger to himself or to others in the context of this plan,' Levine said.

Wound: Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and D.C. police officer Thomas Delahanty were both wounded, and White House Press Secretary James Brady, was critically injured

At the time of the shooting- where he
was supposedly trying to impress the then-college aged actress Jodie 
Foster- Mr Reagan suffered heavy internal bleeding and a punctured lung,
but recovered quickly.

Secret
Service agent Timothy McCarthy and D.C. police officer Thomas Delahanty
were both wounded, and White House Press Secretary James Brady, was 
critically injured.

Kennedy also said Hinckley may be stressed by the fact he may soon have a new attorney in the case.

In August, Levine, Hinckley's longtime
attorney, asked to be allowed to stop representing him, saying that the
Hinckley family was no longer willing to pay his fees.

Kennedy said in court that Hinckley 
has been interviewing new attorneys, and the public defender service 
also has expressed a willingness to represent him.
