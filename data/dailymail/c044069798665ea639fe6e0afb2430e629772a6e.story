A 13-year-old runaway boy drove his father’s Mercedes Benz more than 600m across Europe after rowing with his adoptive parents over a mobile phone bill.

The teenager left his home in the town of Montebelluna in northern Italy on Thursday afternoon and was finally picked up by German police near the border of his home country Poland today.

The boy, a keen go-kart racer, was apparently completely confident behind the wheel and managed to cross two international borders and fill up with petrol twice without raising alarm.

'He looks like a 16-year-old, but still!' Eleonora Spadati, the head of local Carabinieri police in Montebelluna told the AFP news agency.

'He managed to fuel up and pass two borders. It's just incredible,' she added.

The boy, who had been adopted two years ago, was reportedly heading to his original home country Poland where is biological sister lives.

He had argued with his parents after they confiscated his mobile phone as punishment for topping up its credit without their consent.

He left with just £160 and his passport in his pocket.

Having driven from Italy through the Alps into Austria, he proceeded to Germany where he was stopped in Moisburg, just 150km from the border with Poland, by police after his family had alerted Interpol.

He was said to be missing his sister who lives there and had been in touch with her via the internet, according to Italian media.

The teenager’s parents are understood to have gone to Germany to bring him home.
