Susie Wolff smiled and gave a thumbs-up as she began her symbolic journey at Silverstone.

But, after just one timed lap, the first woman to participate in a grand prix weekend for 22 years ground to a halt.

An engine problem forced her Williams out of the first practice session — an anti-climax after all the hoopla surrounding the merits of her involvement.

All over: Wolff was forced to retire from the first practice session after an engine failure in her Williams

Out: Williams' Susie Wolff was massively disappointed with the way she retired in the opening practice

History: The 31-year-old became the first female driver to step into an F1 cockpit during a grand prix weekend

Wolff, 31, was not scheduled to drive in the second session so that was the end of her British Grand Prix. She is, however, due to drive in practice at Hockenheim, Germany in a fortnight.

‘It is a massive disappointment,’ she said. ‘On the plus side, we had such a good build-up to this weekend.

Obviously, I had put so much hard work in to get ready for today and I knew exactly what I had to do on every lap.

Go again: Wolff will be handed another chance at the wheel of the WIlliams in practice for the German GP

Dramatic: Williams teammate Felipe Massa crashed out in a rather more spectacular way during practice

Getting carried away: Massa's car is removed from the track but Williams managed to repair it quickly

‘It felt good — even the out lap —but that is racing. I have known from over the years that there can be massive ups and massive downs.

‘It is very, very disappointing, but I have still got Hockenheim and I have to go out and show what I can do because I did not get the chance to do that today.’

Her misfortune was less dramatic than that of Williams’ other driver, Felipe Massa.

He lost control at Stowe and crashed at 130mph, leaving his machine a mangled mess. Both cars were repaired in time for the second session.
