Hundreds of families feared they would be left without Christmas turkeys, drinks and party food after computer problems hit three major supermarkets.

Customers across Britain were left angry and frustrated when the glitch affected online orders of festive groceries from Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Asda.

With households rushing to stock up for the holiday season, scores of orders at Waitrose could not be assembled, bagged and delivered after a four-hour computer crash on Sunday morning.

Sainsbury's customers were outraged when allocated delivery slots booked weeks in advance were scrapped, with the retailer's website crashing for half an hour 

At Sainsbury’s, a website error left some shoppers struggling to book or change their orders, while Asda customers complained that deliveries had been cancelled without warning.

The problems come as today was predicted to be Britain’s busiest shopping day of the year – and as a report reveals the soaring number of high street stores in ‘significant’ financial distress.

After the supermarket IT issues at the weekend, angry shoppers went on Twitter to complain about the poor service and a lack of information. 

Waitrose customer Paul May complained of ‘appalling’ service. He tweeted: ‘No delivery last night, no call to say it wasn’t calling – no call today to rearrange – Xmas stuff missing.’

Fiona Turner posted yesterday: ‘Still waiting for my Christmas shop since 8pm last night. Not impressed as now have to sort out the shop with a 6month old!”

Asda shopper Patrick Harper stated: 'Entire food delivery for our Christmas holiday just cancelled by Asda but they can deliver... on the 29th! Shocking service.’

Asda customer Justine Webster tweeted: ‘A problem with your website has cancelled my order and delivery for tomorrow! I could cry'

Matt Richardson said: ‘Sainsbury's have let us down 100 per cent. Delivery slot booked two weeks ago - Sainsbury's make a unilateral decision to delete our order. Merry Xmas!'

Nadine Gibbs wrote: ‘@waitrose you cancel my Xmas food shop (inclusive of turkey) no notice and no one answering the phone to resolve. So angry, 3 days b4 Xmas.’

The Sainsbury’s glitch affected customers between 9.20pm and 9.50pm on Sunday night – with some saying their orders disappeared entirely.

The average woman will buy presents for 16 people this Christmas – but men pick up just three, according to a study.

While women buy gifts for husbands, children, parents, grandparents, in-laws, friends, colleagues and neighbours, men’s lists tend to be limited to wives, fathers and the office Secret Santa.

The poll of 2,000 people, by beauty website feelunique.com, found 38 per cent of men admit they buy only one present – for their wife – as she sorts the rest.

Men also tend to prefer online shopping to the high street.

Vikki Fuller, from Frimley, Surrey, said she lost her order despite booking a delivery slot three weeks ago and now has to visit the store for her Christmas shopping.

Emma Mottram, from South East London, said she panicked when the website crashed, leaving her unable to access it.

Asda customer Patrick Harper tweeted: ‘Entire food delivery for our Christmas holiday just cancelled by @asda but they can deliver... on the 29th! Shocking service.’ Another, Anne Gregory, added: ‘Terrible customer service, they’ve taken my money and left us with no food!’

Waitrose said the number of customers involved was in the low hundreds, Sainsbury’s said fewer than 100 of its orders were affected, while Asda said around 40 of its customers had problems. However, Waitrose said it was now ‘back on track’ with orders.

Sainsbury’s said its ‘brief technical issue’ had been fixed, adding: ‘We would like to reassure all customers who have orders outstanding that they will receive their deliveries before Christmas.’

And Asda said: ‘We have been reinstating these orders as a priority today so no-one will miss out on their Asda order, and we’re also giving them a gesture of goodwill to say sorry for the inconvenience.’

Meanwhile, research reveals the financial difficulties faced by high street stores.

Busy day: Shoppers on Oxford Street in central London today. Visa Europe expects some £1.3billion to be spent using its cards tomorrow 

Despite Black Friday sales giving a boost to major brands such as Amazon and John Lewis, some 24,251 retailers are in ‘significant’ distress – an increase of 54 per cent from 15,792 a year ago.

The change is even more marked among clothing stores, with the number in significant distress rising by 123 per cent from 666 to 1,482.

Forget the latest toy. It seems what many children really want for Christmas this year is ... their own private bathroom.

Almost one in five British parents said their youngsters had asked for an ensuite as a present, according to a survey.

And, of course, it was mainly teenagers who wanted more privacy – with the gift most popular among those aged 13 to 18.

Jenny Smith, of bathroom company Ideal Standard, which – unsurprisingly – carried out the survey, said: ‘Kids have seen how an ensuite means not competing with parents or siblings to get in there in the morning.’

There was a 70 per cent rise among food retailers, from 2,243 to 3,819, according to the survey by business experts Begbies Traynor.

Its report said thrifty consumers had slashed their Christmas spending and were holding out for bargains. It said: ‘While Black Friday provided a short-term boost, retailers have failed to convince shoppers to part with their cash this festive season, causing the number of struggling businesses in the sector to increase considerably.’

Researchers calculated ‘distress’ by looking at factors including the number of county court judgments against firms, how much cash was in the bank, debts and rent bills.

Today is expected to be the busiest high street shopping day of the year – with Visa expecting £1.3billion to be spent on its cards, the equivalent of £15,278 every second.

However, separate figures show that the number of shoppers visiting high streets has fallen. On Saturday, there were 6.6 per cent fewer than the equivalent day in 2013, said credit experts Experian.
