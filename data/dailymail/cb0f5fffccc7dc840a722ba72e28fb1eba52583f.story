A Lithuanian man has been handed a life sentence for strangling his ex-wife in Peterborough before taking her dead body to Poland and dumping it in a shallow grave.

Rimas Venclovas, 47, murdered Vitalija Baliutaviciene, 29, after discovering she had started a new life with another man.

Her body was discovered in a remote wood in western Poland by a mushroom-picker more than two months after she disappeared from her home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

Venclovas bragged about his plans to kill and bury Ms Baliutaviciene, also of Lithuanian origin. He spent months planning the murder from his home in Lithuania.

The killer applied for travel documents under an assumed name, used his lover’s credit card to buy supplies, grew his hair and started sporting a moustache.

He even bought a minibus in preparation for the journey to Poland, removing the seats and tinting the windows so no one could see in.

He then staged a ‘dry run’ three weeks before he snatched his ex-wife, sneaking back into the UK to watch her movements and to scout potential burial sites.

Venclovas had been arrested twice by UK 
police over previous attacks on Ms Baliutaviciene and fled to Lithuania while on police 
bail to avoid prosecution.

He denied ever having been violent 
towards her and said bruises on her neck from the earlier attacks were 
‘love bites’ from her new boyfriend.

Venclovas claimed he was not in the country when Ms Baliutaviciene went missing and that both he and his victim had been wrongly identified in CCTV footage of the abduction.

But an Old Bailey jury unanimously convicted him of murder after four hours’ deliberation at the conclusion of a six-week trial.

He pounced on his victim as she was heading to work from her home in Burmer Road, Peterborough, in the early hours of August 12 last year.

Ms Baliutaviciene would normally have
got a lift with a friend to her job at a potato factory, but the car 
had broken down and she had to walk into the centre of Peterborough to 
get a lift with someone else

‘CCTV footage taken a short distance along her route shows her being overpowered and taken away by someone,’ said prosecutor Maureen Baker QC.

‘Then she simply vanished.

‘That is until October 30, when a man gathering mushrooms in a wood in western Poland came across a shallow grave containing her remains.

‘It was established she had died a suddenly and violently as a result of manual choking.

‘The prosecution say that this defendant, her former husband, is responsible for both her kidnap and murder.

‘And, in doing so, did exactly what he always promised her he would.’

Ms Baliutaviciene and Venclovas had been together since she was just 17 and had a son together before marrying in 2007.

They divorced in September 2010, but Venclovas persuaded her to allow him to come to the UK, using their son as a bargaining chip.

Abuse: Venclovas had been questioned by police over previous assaults on his former wife

He was already bent on revenge after she announced she wanted to leave him and had torched a woodland home in Lithuania she had inherited from a relative two months earlier.

Their relationship was punctuated by abuse from Venclovas who became obsessed by the idea his wife was having an affair.

Describing a previous row, Ms Baker said: ‘He was telling her it was the destiny of her son to grow up without a mother, while hers was to be killed by him.’

He eventually fled the UK in February last year after he was questioned by police about an attack on his ex-wife.

An investigation into an earlier assault the previous year was dropped on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service because of difficulties understanding Ms Baliutaviciene, who spoke little English.

‘Subsequent events have of course called that decision into question,’ said Ms Baker.

After fleeing to Lithuania, Venclovas kept in touch with his ex-wife and their son over Skype and started plotting the killing when he found out she was seeing Ako Garib, a workmate from the potato factory.

He made his first trip back to the UK in July last year when, despite still being wanted by Cambridgeshire Police for the second attack on Ms Baliutaviciene, he managed to enter and leave the country without being arrested.

He used the visit to stalk his ex-wife and find out about her movements and to scout burial sites in the remote Fenland around Peterborough.

Returning to his homeland, he enlisted a new lover to help tint the windows of his green Mercedes Vito minibus so nobody could see inside.

Two days before the killing, he dropped hints about his plan to Ms Baliutaviciene’s mother, Vanda Cereneckiene, during a meeting at her home.

‘He was saying she would be kidnapped and sold,’ she said. ‘Those kinds of things.

‘He said she was a loose woman and that she goes with anyone in Peterborough.’

During a further visit after the killing, he told Ms Cereneckiene: ‘I’ve come to tell you that Vitalija’s not around any more.’

But instead of owning up, he accused her of cooking up a plot with her daughter to fake the disappearance so he would be denied access to their son.

Venclovas, who was born Rimantas Baliutavicius, from Taurage, Lithuania, denied murder and kidnapping, but an Old Bailey jury unanimously convicted him of murder after four hours’ deliberation at the conclusion of a six-week trial.

Venclovas showed no emotion at the verdict, yet giggled and smirked in the dock as Judge Mr Justice Fulford jailed him for life with a minimum term of 20 years.

‘This was no sudden rush of blood to the head but instead it was coldly planned and ruthlessly executed,’ the judge told him.

‘There is no mitigation and you have shown not an ounce of remorse.

‘Instead, you have been caught out by modern technology which with near pinpoint accuracy tracked your movements from beginning to end.

‘Indeed, it is to be observed in this case that if digital records from CCTV and other cameras across England, along with those for mobile telephone and satellite navigation devices across Europe, had not been available for police investgation, you would almost certainly have got away with murder.’

The judge said Venclovas’ previous attacks on Ms Baliutaviciene suggested he had subjected her to prolonged torture in her final moments by holding her ‘at the edge of unconsciousness’.

‘I am sure that on this occasion you would have wanted her to know exactly what was going to happen to her,’ he added.

‘And you would have guaranteed that her last moments were spent in the misery of the full realisation that her position was hopeless and that she was going to die.’

Venclovas, who appeared newly shaven-headed in court today, has previous convictions in Lithuania for using counterfeit documents, driving offences, theft and stealing State property - but no offences of violence.
