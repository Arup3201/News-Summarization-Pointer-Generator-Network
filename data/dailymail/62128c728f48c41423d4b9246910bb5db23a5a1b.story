World leaders attending the G20 Summit have been promised tougher security across Queensland's international airports ahead of and during the event in November.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has made the announcement today, as part of the government's roll-out of counter terrorism measures. 

‘The future outlook for Australia’s borders is very challenging, more than ever before ensuring the security and integrity of our borders is essential,' Mr Morrison said.

Federal Police will be one of nine agencies involved in reporting to the Strategic Border Command headquarters in Canberra

'The regional command in Queensland, its footprint is significant.

'It is responsible for 14 ports, 3 major international airports and the facilitation of up to 4000 delegates expected to attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November.

'To stay ahead of these growing threats it is important that the government not only talks the talk but walks the walk,' he said.

The Immigration Minister was speaking at the launch of the Customs and Border Protection Regional Command in Brisbane.

'There needs to be a strong command, an arrangement in place, that all the resources are well managed and are well directed and fused together with our other law enforcement agencies.

'This is a critical step in the creation of the border force. It ensures better monitoring of our borders 24/7 in real time from the (Strategic Border Command) headquarters in Canberra.'

Mr Morrison said this link, which includes live operational pictures beamed back to the HQ in the nation's capital, guarantees that resources will be 'deployed as they are needed'.

He pointed to the scale of control required by the local command, which on average will oversee 126,000 plane passengers and and crew travelling internationally each week, along with 3300 air cargo consignments and hundreds of sea cargo and cruise ships every week.

'There are five regional commands around the country, 3000 plus officers who form part of the national force,' Mr Morrison said.

Mr Morrison says bolstered surveillance of airports and borders will allow officers 'to focus their attention on other matters' including the apprehending of terror suspects

'We are contributing to strong borders here in Queensland as we are right around the country.'

He has also announced the doubling of E-gates across Australia's eight international airports.

Another 62 Departure eGates, which include eye and passport scanning, will be added to the 61 currently available. They are expected to be in place by mid-2015.

Mr Morrison says these plans will enable customs and border officials 'to focus their attention on other matters', which includes the apprehending of terror suspects.

These measures will all be linked to the establishment, from 1 July next year, of the Australian Border Force, bringing together the departments of Immigration and Customs and Border Protection.
