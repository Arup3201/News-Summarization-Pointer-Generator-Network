Two police officers involved in the violent arrest that ended with a father-of-six dying Thursday after being put in a chokehold by a cop have been relegated to desk duty, the NYPD acknowledged Friday.

Eric Garner, a 43-year-old who weighed 400lb and suffered from asthma, can be heard repeatedly shouting: 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' in cellphone footage captured by outraged bystanders.

The video sent shock waves across the city and outraged enough people that Mayor Bill de Blasio cancelled a previously planned trip and ordered a full investigation.

Family tragedy: Father-of-six Eric Garner, 43, died on Thursday after being put in a 
chokehold by police and pinned to the ground on Staten Island

Both officers, whom the department has 
declined to name, have been placed on desk duty, Police Commissioner 
William Bratton announced.

'The
 two officers who were engaged in the arrest of the deceased – one is an
 eight year veteran and the other is a four-year veteran – both officers
 have been assigned to desk duty pending the investigation.'

The one who administered the chokehold is thought by at least one source be on the chopping block.

'There’s
 a very high chance that the officer who put him in a chokehold would 
lose his job,' a person familiar with the investigation told the New 
York Post. 'It violates protocol.

'It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a chokehold.'

Missed: Eric Garner was described as a gentle giant by those who knew him

Garner was shown on the video, made public by the New York Daily News, being thrown down and then pinned to the ground by five cops, one of whom can be seen slamming his head into the concrete sidewalk outside a Staten Island store where it is believed he worked.

Officers claim Garner was illegally selling cigarettes at the store, but witnesses told the New York Post he was trying to break up a fight between two people that bolted from the scene just before the cops arrived.

Garner was on the ground less than a minute before he stopped struggling and appeared to be unconscious.

The ailing father was rushed to a nearby hospital in cardiac arrest, he was pronounced dead soon after, according to reports.

Garner leaves his wife Esaw, six children and two grandchildren. They are devastated he is gone.

'When I kissed my husband this morning, I never thought it would be for the last time,' his wife told the Daily News:

She said that police gave her little information when she went to hospital to identify her husband's body.

Mr Garner, 43, pictured with an unidentified woman, was trying to break up a fight on Thursday when police arrested him, his family said. Mr Garner later died in hospital following a cardiac arrest

Garner had a history of selling untaxed cigarettes, but the deceased 
man's family insisted he had none
 on him at the time of the deadly arrest.

The father-of-six was not armed, according to reports.

Garner had a court date scheduled in October for selling untaxed cigarettes and pot possession, records showed.

His
 wife said that he had a history of ill health, including asthma and 
diabetes, which made it difficult for him to hold down a job.

On the video, Garner is seen sitting outside a store when he is approached by plainclothes officers.

Garner can be heard telling the cops: 'Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today.'

More officers arrive and when Garner refuses to put his hands behind his back to be cuffed, an officer grabs him from behind in a chokehold. 

Several other officers then wrestle the man to the ground before one appears to pin his head to the concrete.

After repeatedly telling the officers 'I can't breathe', Garner goes quiet and stops struggling.  

Police are seen on the cellphone footage trying to move bystanders away from the rapidly deteriorating situation, but the shooter of the footage is remarkably able to capture what is happening.

Confrontation: Eric Garner was stopped by police on this sidewalk

After the incident, posters saying 'no justice, no peace' 'and Another innocent black man has been killed by police brutality. The NYPD must be stopped!' appeared in the area. 

Reverend Lloyd Land, from the First United Christian Church, told Staten Island Live: 'He was a gentle giant. Insofar as violence, I don't believe if you smack him in the face he would hit you back ... The police have no reason to attack him.'

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promised a full investigation into Mr Garner's death.

'On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr Garner, who died yesterday afternoon while being placed in police custody,' hizzoner said in a Friday statement.

'We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD. That is a responsibility that Police Commissioner Bratton and I take very seriously. We are harnessing all resources available to the City to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the circumstances of this tragic incident.

'The NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau is working closely with the Office of the Richmond County District Attorney, which is leading this investigation.'
