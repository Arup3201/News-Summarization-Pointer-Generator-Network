Chelsea may be already in the thick of pre-season but two of their Spanish stars are still having fun in the sun.

Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres met up with Barcelona star Xavi in Sardinia, and posed for a snap outside nightclub Billionaire on the island's Porto Cervo.

All of the Spain World Cup flops had their glamorous WAGs in tow - Fabregas taking centre stage with Daniella Semaan, Torres with his wife Olalla and Xavi with his other half Nuria Cunillera.

Teammates: The Spanish players relax in Sardinia after their poor World Cup showing

Fabregas and Torres will link up with Jose Mourinho's side for their pre-season tour, while Xavi will return to Fabregas' former club Barcelona under the watch of new boss Luis Enrique.

All three players were in Vicente Del Bosque's World Cup side, who crashed out in the group stages in Brazil.

Chelsea played their first match of pre-season on Wednesday night, with a young side shorn of their Spanish stars thumped Wycombe 4-0.

John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic showed their experience with a goal each, while a brace from Izzy Brown and Patrick Bamford's opener showed Mourinho some of the young talent in the Blues' academy.
